Delhi’s Air Pollution Gets Attention, But Most Indian Cities Are As Bad Or Worse | I Witness

NEW DELHI: Taking in what it called an important step towards environmental governance and reducing dependence on foreign certification systems, India has set up the world's second National Environmental Standard Laboratory (NESL) here at the CSIR-National Physical Laboratory (NPL) that will develop testing and calibration facilities for air pollution monitoring equipment in the country.Currently, most of the instruments used in India for air pollution monitoring are imported. These imported instruments, however, come with production certification from international agencies based on the environmental conditions of the certificate issuing countries in Europe or the US.Since environmental conditions of those countries are very different from the conditions prevalent in India, it affects the quality of measurements by the instrument operating for a long time in Indian conditions, CSIR-NPL scientists explained. At present, only the UK has such a laboratory.The NESL, inaugurated by Union science & technology minister Jitendra Singh on 80th Foundation Day celebrations of CSIR-NPL - the apex institution for metrology and custodian of India's national standards - Monday, will now not only deal with the anomaly arising out of different environmental conditions but also help in manufacturing of standardised monitoring equipment.The difference in temperature, humidity, pollution mix and high dust load due to difference in environmental or weather conditions of certifying countries often affected the long-term reliability and transparency of the data generated in India.The NESL will, however, allow manufacturers, industries, and municipal agencies to validate performance within the country, ensuring credible data for the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP), industrial emission audits, and smart-city monitoring networks.","India has set up the world's second national environmental standard laboratory (nesl) it will develop testing and calibration facilities for air pollution monitoring equipment.

ISRO Launches Heaviest-Ever Satellite BlueBird Block-2 Onboard LVM3 Rocket

NEW DELHI: Isro will usher in the new year with the first launch of 2026 — PSLV C62 mission — on Monday (January 12) at 10.17 am from the first launchpad at the Sriharikota spaceport. The rocket will launch an advanced earth observation satellite EOS-N1 (codenamed ‘Anvesha’), another ‘eye in the sky’ that will boost India’s surveillance powers from space. Besides the primary payload EOS-N1, PSLV will also be carrying an European demonstrator satellite and 17 other satellites belonging to Indian and foreign agencies.EOS-N1 is a hyperspectral imaging satellite developed primarily for the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). It is capable of “seeing” in hundreds of wavelengths to identify materials on the ground—making it a high-priority asset for national security and surveillance. It will help India secure its borders because of its advanced remote sensing capabilities and will also be used in various fields such as agriculture, urban mapping and environmental observation.Besides EOS-N1, 18 secondary payloads, including Europe’s Kestrel Initial Demonstrator (KID), will piggyback on the primary satellite and will be placed in space. The KID mission will feature an experimental re-entry of a small capsule in collaboration with a Spanish startup, with a planned splashdown in the South Pacific Ocean.Other secondary payloads are cubesats from Indian startups and universities, including OrbitAID's AayulSAT, CV Raman Global University's CGUSAT-1, Dhruva Space’s DA-1, Space Kidz India’s SR-2, Assam Don Bosco University’s Lachit-1, Akshath Aerospace’s Solaras-S4 and Dayanand Sagar University’s DSAT-1.Bengaluru-based space startup OrbitAID Aerospace is set to make history with AayulSAT, India’s first on-orbit satellite refuelling payload. AayulSAT aims to extend satellite lifespans by enabling refuelling and servicing in orbit, addressing space debris and sustainability challenges.The upcoming PSLVC62 mission is also seen as a comeback for the PSLV programme following the earlier setback with PSLV-C61 in May 2025. The earlier PSLV-C61 mission had failed to launch EOS-09 earth observation satellite due to a technical issue in the rocket's third stage, specifically a drop in chamber pressure, preventing the satellite from reaching its intended sun-synchronous polar orbit. While the first two stages performed normally, the anomaly in the third stage led to the mission failure.","Isro will usher in the new year with the first launch of 2026 — pslv c62 mission.

Cleveland ties, contract power, and conflicting views on Harbaugh’s Ravens departure

John Harbaugh’s sudden availability has reshaped the NFL coaching market overnight. After 18 seasons in Baltimore, the Super Bowl-winning coach is out, and teams with openings are already lining up. The Cleveland Browns are reportedly emerging as a serious contender to land Harbaugh.He is an Ohio native, born in Toledo, and played college football at Miami University in Oxford. Both John and his brother Jim grew up Browns fans, adding an emotional layer to the potential move. Cleveland’s long search for sustained success makes the fit even more compelling. Reporter Dan Labbe believes Browns owner Jimmy Haslam would not hesitate to make an aggressive offer to Harbaugh.Labbe said, “All those Cleveland ties. They could maybe sell him on this defense. He said some great things about this defense during the season and was very complimentary of the Browns. The big thing is, we know this: Jimmy Haslam is not afraid to spend money.” According to Labbe, Cleveland could present Harbaugh with a contract similar to Jon Gruden’s deal with the Raiders.He explained, “They could have John Harbaugh come in, and he could offer him a Jon Gruden-style contract that he signed with the Raiders, which I think was 10 years, $100 million.Jimmy could offer that.” While the number is staggering, the annual value would actually be lower than Harbaugh’s most recent Ravens deal.He signed a three-year extension in March 2025 that reportedly paid him $17 million per year through 2028. Still, long-term security and control could be appealing for a coach who has already accomplished nearly everything. However, Baltimore’s decision to move on has not been without controversy.NFL insider Ian Rapoport suggested internal issues played a role, stating, “My understanding, after talking to several sources involved, is that simply Harbaugh lost the locker room.” That claim was quickly challenged by ESPN’s Adam Schefter, who dismissed talk of a fractured relationship during an appearance on the Pat McAfee Show.Also read: John Harbaugh's future: 3 possible landing spots for former Ravens' coach","John harbaugh's sudden availability has reshaped the nfl coaching market overnight.

Investor concerns beyond Jeff Bezos







Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’, even he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society. Recently, speaking at the Italian Tech Week alongside Exor CEO John Elkann, Bezos said that the excitement around AI has led to unusual investor behaviour, with billions of dollars flowing into companies regardless strong fundamentals.Bezos explained that bubbles are characterised by inflated stock prices and a rush of funding into both good and bad ideas. This makes it difficult for the investor to distinguish.Bezos further outlined the hallmarks of bubbles. He said that the current AI climate as one where “every experiment or idea gets funded,” even if the fundamentals are weak. He pointed to unusual behavior such as small companies with only a handful of employees receiving billions of dollars in investment. This, he said, is a hallmark of industrial bubbles, where excitement drives capital into ventures indiscriminately.Despite this caution, Bezos feels that the technology itself is genuine and transformative. “AI is real, and it is going to change every industry,” he told the audience. He further compared the situation to the biotech bubble of the 1990s, which witnessed many companies fail but ultimately produced some life-saving drugs. Industrial bubbles, he argued, are not necessarily harmful; when the dust settles, society benefits from the inventions that survive.Bezos’ remarks echo a growing chorus of warnings from business leaders. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has previously said the AI market is in a bubble. At the same event in Turin, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon cautioned that investor excitement often overlooks risks, predicting a “reset” or “drawdown” in valuations. Similarly, Karim Moussalem, chief investment officer at Selwood Asset Management, recently said the AI trade is beginning to resemble “one of the great speculative manias of market history. ”","Amazon founder jeff bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’ however, even he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society.

Mark Cuban on biggest barrier for students





American billionaire and Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban said that students these days use artificial intelligence (AI) excessively to ask the “right questions”. However, he said that students should not rely much on AI. Instead, they must use AI to enhance their own critical-thinking skills, rather than replace them. “They use strong inputs and apply critical thinking to evaluate results,” he said adding “AI helps students think bigger, but it doesn’t make decisions”.In an interview with CNBC’s Make It last year, Cuban said that tomorrow’s leaders might be today’s AI-obsessed kids. “Students who use AI will produce better, more creative work and gain a collaborative relationship with technology that’s needed in the future workplace,” he said adding: “Students who use AI will be best equipped to lead.”During the interview, Mark Cuban said that “Access is the biggest barrier” to students being taught how to best use AI tools effectively and ethically at school. According to Samsung’s new Solve for Tomorrow 2025 AI Readiness Study, 80% of US teachers believe that learning AI skills is important for students’ success in the future. However, research shows that educators have expressed concern over misuse of AI tools to cheat, or that the information obtained from AI models will include errors that spread misinformation.But Cuban has asserted that students need to learn to use AI tools properly and productively. He has previously likened the current AI boom to past technological revolutions, particularly the rise of computers and the internet. “Spend as much time as possible familiarizing yourself with the latest AI tools and models, so you can impress future employers with your up-to-date prompt engineering and model customization skills,” an advice that he often gives to students, per a CNBC report.Speaking on an episode of the “TBPN” podcast in 2025, Mark Cuban said”“Every single company needs that. There is nothing intuitive for a company to integrate AI, and that’s what people don’t understand. That is going to be jobs left and right.”","Mark cuban said that students these days use artificial intelligence (ai) excessively to ask the “right questions” he said that they must use ai to enhance their own critical-thinking skills, rather than replace them. “ai helps students think bigger, but it doesn’t make decisions”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126352688,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-29300,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Nvidia’s Alpamayo to debut with Mercedes CLA





At the ongoing Consumer Electronics Show (CES), Nvidia launched Alpamayo – an open source AI model for autonomous vehicles. Announcing the new AI model, CEO Jensen Huang said that it is the world’s first thinking, reasoning autonomous vehicle AI. He further revealed that the Alpamayo is launching on US roads later this year, starting with the Mercedes CLA. “Alpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments, and explain their driving decisions,” he further added. Responding to one such posts about the autonomous vehicle AI, Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote:“Well that’s just exactly what Tesla is doing 😂 What they will find is that it’s easy to get to 99% and then super hard to solve the long tail of the distribution.”Alpamayo introduces Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models designed for self-driving systems. The models will allow autonomous vehicles to understand visual inputs, assess driving situations and decide on driving actions. The platform also includes large reasoning models, simulation tools to test rare or unusual driving situations, and open datasets that can be used for training and validation.Talking about Alpamayo, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement that “The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is here – when machines begin to understand, reason, and act in the real world”.“It's trained end-to-end. Literally from camera in to actuation out; It reasons what action it is about to take, the reason by which it came about that action, and the trajectory”, he added.""With a 10-billion-parameter architecture, Alpamayo 1 uses video input to generate trajectories alongside reasoning traces, showing the logic behind each decision. Developers can adapt Alpamayo 1 into smaller runtime models for vehicle development, or use it as a foundation for AV development tools such as reasoning-based evaluators and auto-labeling systems. Alpamayo 1 provides open model weights and open-source inferencing scripts. Future models in the family will feature larger parameter counts, more detailed reasoning capabilities, more input and output flexibility, and options for commercial usage,"" he continued.As mentioned above, Nvidia has partnered with Mercedes to bring its autonomous vehicle AI. Announcing the partnership, the chip maker said “NVIDIA is enabling a new era of AI-defined driving, bringing its NVIDIA DRIVE AV software with enhanced level 2 point-to-point driver assistance capabilities to U.S. roads, expected by end of this year — starting with Mercedes-Benz, a long-standing partner in advancing safe, intelligent mobility. ”“The all-new Mercedes-Benz CLA — the brand’s first vehicle featuring the MB.OS platform — introduces advanced driver-assistance features powered by NVIDIA’s full-stack DRIVE AV software, AI infrastructure and accelerated compute.This design may enable over-the-air updates of future upgrades and new features, including planned enhancements to MB.DRIVE ASSIST PRO, which may be available ex-factory and through the Mercedes-Benz store.”","Nvidia’s alpamayo to debut with mercedes cla later this year.

EXPOSED: Mark Zuckerberg Embarrassed on Hot Mic Admitting Total Confusion During Trump Dinner





Ever since Mark Zuckerberg announced the creation of Meta Superintelligence Labs in first half of 2025, Meta CEO has been on an AI hiring blitz. A Twitter user who goes by the moniker @HinataMotivates, said to be a tech-motivation account, shared a podcast clip (going back to 2022) where Zuckerberg talks about Meta hiring rule and his advice for college students. Mark Zuckerberg has a hiring rule that he says is cardinal for him while hiring anyone and the one that he says is also an important tip for any college student. In an episode of the “Lex Fridman Podcast,” hosted by MIT computer scientist Lex Fridman, Zuckerberg said that most people know Facebook ’s dorm-room origin story and that many have learned the wrong lesson from it. He said that his initial ability to launch Facebook wasn’t because he dropped out of college. According to Zuckerberg, it was due to the personal connections he made while he was still in school.Who you spend time with in college, Zuckerberg said, is “the most important decision” any student can make in college. He advised college students that choosing their social circle is the most pivotal decision, as people tend to emulate those around them. “You become the people you surround yourself with,” he said in the podcast.“I think probably people are too, in general, objective focused, and maybe not focused enough on the connections and the people who they’re basically building relationships [with]. ” Meta CEO Zuckerberg is said to have met his Facebook co-founders ⁠— Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes and Andrew McCollum ⁠— while the five were students at Harvard University.While the group split up in a not-so-happy manner, Zuckerberg said on the podcast that he tries to prioritize relationships over objectives. This applies especially to hiring. Zuckerberg said that he extends the idea to his Meta hiring philosophy: He only employs candidates he did hypothetically work for, underscoring reciprocity and alignment in professional networks. When evaluating a job candidate, he imagines what it would be like to work for that person. “I will only hire someone to work for me if I can see myself working for them,” he said.Mark Zuckerberg said that the strategy creates a work environment that’s both more cohesive and more productive: If you work with people who share your values on a human level, you’ll be more likely to smoothly achieve your work goals together.

Zoho senior engineer ships three-week projects in one day





Zoho founder and Chief Scientist Sridhar Vembu has revealed that one of his engineers recently built a sophisticated assembly and machine code security tool alone in just one month—work that would typically require a team of three to four developers an entire year. The breakthrough, Vembu disclosed on X, came after the engineer discovered Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5 model, which he called a ""game changer"" that finally convinced him AI-generated code was worth using.""I did not know he was building it. I was blown away by the depth and breadth of the tool,"" Vembu wrote, describing how the experienced developer from his R&D team created the project in his spare time. The Zoho founder characterized the moment as the arrival of ""powerful machine looms for software development,"" comparing the disruption to how mechanized weaving once challenged traditional handloom workers.The productivity gains extend across Zoho's engineering organization. Vembu shared that one of the company's most productive engineers—a veteran with two decades of experience handling performance-critical UI work—is now completing in a single day what previously took three weeks. ""AI needed him to provide the structure, it fleshed out the details and that required him to draw on his experience,"" Vembu explained.The Indian SaaS giant has rolled out AI coding tools company-wide but with strict guardrails. Engineers must review and approve all AI-generated code and take full responsibility for it, Vembu emphasized. Zoho doesn't mandate AI usage, instead leaving implementation decisions to experienced developers who can assess when the technology adds value.Even junior developers are seeing breakthroughs. Vembu noted that a less experienced team member built an internal tool with AI assistance that's now being used across multiple teams—work that wouldn't have been possible without the technology. For UI development specifically, Vembu's team is ""very bullish on AI.""""As Chief Scientist, I am under pressure,"" Vembu admitted, acknowledging the technology's transformative impact.

Microsoft CEO 'Thrilled' About India's Growing Data Centre Capacity, Details Meet With PM Modi





OpenAI cofounder disagrees with CEO Sam Altman on AGI timeline





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently shared what he sees as a key test for the next stage of artificial intelligence (AI). As companies race to build AI agents that can act independently, Suleyman said he is watching for a milestone he calls Artificial Capable Intelligence (ACI) on the path toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). He said that the test is simple in context but difficult in execution – whether an AI agent can legally take $1,00,000 and turn it into $1 million. He described the test as “modern turing test”, suggesting it will show how AI systems can plan, reason, make decisions and operate within real-word rules.“The next big milestone I'm watching for on our way to AGI: Artificial Capable Intelligence (ACI). Can an agent take $100k and legally turn it into $1M? To me that's the modern Turing Test,” Mustafa Suleyman wrote in a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter).Suleyman’s comments come as several technology leaders including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff bet heavily on AI agents as the next major shift in enterprise software. Companies such as OpenAI, Salesforce, Microsoft and others are promoting agents that can carry out tasks with limited human input, from writing code to managing business workflows.Last year, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff called the rise of AI in the workforce a “digital labor revolution,” estimating that the software company has reached about 93% accuracy with the technology.In an interview with Bloomberg then, he revealed that AI is doing up to 50% of the work at Salesforce.In 2025, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicted that AI could soon automate up to 40% of the tasks humans currently perform. He also claimed that AGI could arrive before 2030.Recently, OpenAI cofounder and AI researcher Andrej Karpathy pushed back against the “agentic AI” hype, characterizing the current generation of autonomous AI systems as “slop.” Karpathy has directly challenged the notion that autonomous AI agents are on the cusp of delivering as promised, positioning himself in contrast to the optimistic timelines often suggested by figures like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.“I feel like the industry is making too big of a jump and is trying to pretend like this is amazing, and it’s not. It’s slop,"" Karpathy said on The Dwarkesh Podcast.“They’re not coming to terms with it, and maybe they’re trying to fundraise or something like that. We’re at this intermediate stage,” he added.","Microsoft ai ceo mustafa suleyman proposes a new test for advanced ai: can an agent legally grow $100,000 into $1 million?

Canned fish to ramen: Chinese companies make big push into Indian food market at Indusfood 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/noida/canned-fish-to-ramen-chinese-companies-make-big-push-into-indian-food-market-at-indusfood-2026/articleshow/126426345.cms,"





NOIDA: Amid global trade headwinds unleashed by US tariffs, Chinese food companies are making a renewed push to enter the Indian market, registering the biggest foreign presence at Indusfood 2026, the global trade expo that opened on Thursday in Greater Noida.From canned mushrooms and chickpeas to customised instant noodles aimed at India’s fast-growing appetite for Korean ramen, 15 Chinese exhibitors have brought a broad mix of products tailored for Indian consumers. Several companies are pitching vegetarian, non-fried and less spicy variants, signalling a deliberate attempt to adapt to local tastes rather than sell off-the-shelf imports.Food businesses from Iran, the Netherlands, Egypt, Palestine, Brazil, Azerbaijan and Greece are also looking to bite into the giant Indian food market, pitching everything from olives and pickles to baklava, kunafa, sugarcane-based spirits and premium rice.The three-day expo was inaugurated by Union minister for food processing industries Chirag Paswan. Addressing buyers and industry representatives, Paswan said platforms like Indusfood connect India’s production potential with international markets, foster trust, strengthen long-term partnerships and accelerate the vision of making India a global food basket.“Now that we are food surplus (country), we all need to convert this volume into value.We all know the strength of the sector and the untapped potential of India to be the global food basket. The need is to now channelise the resources,” he said.Mohit Singla, chairman of the Trade Promotion Council of India, which organised the event, said Indusfood 2026 has brought together more than 2,200 exhibitors from over 30 countries. China, he said, accounted for the single largest national presence at the fair.Interest in Chinese products was evident on the opening day, particularly at the stall of Jinmailang Food, a ramen manufacturer that drew crowds with live demonstrations and sampling sessions. Chris, a company representative, said Jinmailang had closely tracked Indian consumption patterns following the surge in popularity of Korean ramen. “We are offering several varieties, including vegetarian options such as mock chicken, which tastes like chicken but is vegetarian. We also have non-fried and less spicy ramen variants to suit Indian preferences,” he said.Another Chinese exhibitor, Tianjin Heng Jun Long Commercial Co Ltd, is targeting India’s growing urban workforce with canned food products. Sun Meipin, a company representative, said the firm is showcasing canned vegetables, fruits and fish. “As young working professionals get busier, canned foods can help solve everyday cooking challenges. We are looking to collaborate with Indian retailers to bring our products to store shelves,” she said.Beyond food, the Hong Kong pavilion also featured stalls selling traditional Chinese medicine products. Yan Lam from BeautyHealth Plus said the company was displaying herbal eye drops made from natural ingredients such as ginseng, safflower and borneol, marketed for conditions including dry eyes and myopia.European and Latin American brands also drew attention. Greece-based Danais SA is showcasing canned peaches and apricots, while Brazil’s Expodireto Cotrijal is promoting cachaça, a distilled spirit made from fermented sugarcane juice. “Cachaça is known globally for its distinctive taste, different from rum. It is best enjoyed with lemon and ice,” a company representative said.One of the more personal stories at the expo comes from the Palestine stall, where Diab Mahroum, a fourth-generation confectioner, is presenting baklava and kunafa under the Mahroum brand. His family has been making Middle Eastern sweets since 1890, supplying retail markets across the region and B2B clients in the US, Germany, Australia and Hong Kong. Mahroum said his interest in India grew after observing strong demand among Indian consumers in Dubai. The company has also launched sugar-free variants.Among other exhibitors, Egypt’s Zahrat El Wady is showcasing pickles and olives, while Azerbaijan’s Alisa Dadashov is promoting masala tea and premium rice.On the sidelines of the expo, the India–UAE Food Corridor, led by the Abu Dhabi Food Hub, was launched to enhance food security, streamline supply chains and accelerate bilateral food trade between the two countries.","15 chinese exhibitors have brought a broad mix of products tailored for indian consumers.

Saudi Arabia is stepping up efforts to increase local workforce participation in specialized jobs. The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development has unveiled two major decisions that set higher saudization targets and introduce minimum wage standards, aiming to create better opportunities for citizens in vital sectors.Saudization, or “Nitaqat,” is a national policy designed to increase the employment of Saudi citizens across public and private sectors. Its goal is to reduce reliance on expatriate labor and ensure that Saudi nationals are well-represented in key professions. The policy sets specific targets for businesses, requiring them to employ a certain percentage of Saudi workers depending on industry and role. Compliance is monitored by the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development, with guidance provided on calculation methods, required documentation, and enforcement procedures.Under the first decision, Saudization in engineering professions will rise to 30 percent. This change targets companies with five or more employees working in 46 specialized roles, including:A new minimum wage of SAR 8,000 will apply to Saudi engineers in both private and non-profit sectors. To qualify, professionals must hold accreditation from the Saudi Council of Engineers.The decision took effect on December 31, 2025, but companies will have six months to prepare before full enforcement.This preparation period allows businesses to adjust hiring practices, ensure proper accreditation, and align with Saudization requirements.The ministry has highlighted that the move will not only significantly increase Saudi participation but also improve the overall work environment by fostering highly skilled, certified professionals in the sector.The second decision focuses on procurement roles in the private sector, setting a saudization target of 70 percent. This applies to establishments employing three or more workers in 12 key procurement positions, such as:This regulation comes into effect on November 30, 2025, with a six-month grace period to allow companies time to meet the new requirements.The ministry emphasized that increasing Saudi participation in procurement will strengthen national engagement in critical business operations, expand job opportunities for citizens, and enhance overall productivity within the sector.To guide businesses through the transition, the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development has published a procedural guide on its website. The guide provides:Companies are urged to follow the guidelines carefully. Failure to meet the new targets may result in penalties, reinforcing the government’s commitment to building a more locally-driven workforce.The ministry described these important measures as part of a strategic step toward boosting employment opportunities for Saudis, improving workplace standards, and strengthening national participation in vital economic sectors.","Saudi arabia enforces new saudization rules, giving engineers sar 8,000 wage and boosting procurement jobs.

A new era for foreign investment in Saudi Capital Market





CMA’s gradual reforms





Saudi market investment impact





Positioning Saudi Arabia as global market









Saudi Arabia is opening its doors to the world. Starting February 1, global investors can directly tap into the Kingdom’s capital market, a bold move designed to boost liquidity and attract international capital. The Capital Market Authority (CMA) is removing old restrictions that once limited access to only a select few, signalling a new era for Saudi finance.Under the revised rules, all categories of foreign investors will now be able to invest directly across all segments of the Saudi capital market. The CMA has eliminated the “Qualified Foreign Investor” designation, which previously required international investors to have direct and consistent access to the Saudi market to participate.The amendments also remove the framework governing swap agreements. Previously, non-resident investors could only gain economic exposure to listed securities, rather than owning shares outright. With the changes, direct share ownership in the Main Market is now permitted, marking a significant step toward full market integration with global investors.The February opening follows a series of measured steps by the CMA over the past year to broaden market access.In July 2025, the authority simplified procedures for certain foreign investors, including individuals residing in Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries and former Saudi or GCC residents, to open and operate investment accounts. This earlier step served as an interim phase, designed to build confidence and prepare the market for full-scale international participation.In October 2025, the CMA released a draft regulatory framework outlining the new rules for non-resident investors on its Unified Electronic Platform for public and government consultation. These moves reflect a gradual, phased approach to transforming Saudi Arabia’s capital market into an attractive global investment destination.The CMA expects the reforms to expand and diversify the investor base, attract additional international inflows, and enhance overall market liquidity. International investors already held approximately 590 billion riyals ($157 billion) in the Saudi capital market by the end of the third quarter of 2025. Foreign investments in the Main Market alone reached about 519 billion riyals, up from 498 billion riyals at the end of 2024.The Kingdom has been actively seeking foreign participation as part of its broader economic plan to reduce reliance on oil. Initiatives such as establishing exchange-traded funds with partners in Japan and Hong Kong, and opening listed real estate firms in Mecca and Medina to foreign investors, have laid the groundwork for these reforms.These amendments are a major milestone in Saudi Arabia’s vision to position its capital market as an international hub capable of attracting substantial foreign capital. By removing barriers to direct investment and streamlining access, the CMA aims to increase confidence in the Main Market while supporting local economic growth. Analysts expect the move to strengthen the Kingdom’s appeal to institutional investors and portfolio managers worldwide.With the new regulations in place from February, Saudi Arabia takes a decisive step toward becoming a fully integrated, globally accessible market, inviting investors to play a more direct role in the Kingdom’s financial future.","Saudi arabia will open its capital market to global investors, boosting liquidity and international participation.
