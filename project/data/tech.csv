"'No tip, no ride’: Bengaluru commuters slam auto apps over unfair tipping system, say 'drivers also demand more money at drop points'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/no-tip-no-ride-bengaluru-commuters-slam-auto-apps-over-unfair-tipping-system-say-drivers-also-demand-more-money-at-drop-points/articleshow/119687089.cms,"BENGALURU: Passengers using app-based autos are voicing their frustration, claiming they end up paying as much as they would have if they hailed the vehicle on the road. During peak hours, drivers accept bookings only if customers add a tip ranging from Rs 10 to Rs 80, they say. Besides, some drivers allegedly demand additional money at drop points.Mobile apps display messages: 'Adding a tip might help increase the chances of getting a ride faster', 'Now you can set a price that works for you', 'Add a tip for faster pick up', 'A driver may be more likely to accept this ride if you add a tip', 'Your driver receives 100% of the tip. If you add a tip now, you can't change it later', and 'High demand, selected tip helps you find a ride faster'. Passengers say the aggregators appear to be hand in glove with what seems to be a new mode of surge pricing.Niharika B, a passenger, said, ""When I tried to book a cab from Residency Road to Bellandur, the app displayed a fare of Rs 296, which was close to Rs 20 per km. I tried booking without tip but was unable to find an auto despite multiple attempts. It was only after I agreed to pay a tip of Rs 50 that an auto driver accepted the booking. This is happening routinely.""Sushmitha Harish, another passenger, said the auto fare from her home at Ramamurthy Nagar to Byappanahalli Metro station back gate is Rs 75. ""The mobile app I often use charges me Rs 90-100 for it every time. Since last week, I noticed a hike. It charges Rs 110-120. If it charges one-and-a-half or even double, why do I need the help of an app? I might as well bargain with an auto driver myself. It will turn out to be cheaper than going through these apps. Now that the auto fares are going to be revised, booking through apps will become totally unaffordable. The apps were once saviours for us. They became a hit because they understood the pain of a daily commuter and gave a solution to this. Now, they have become bigger fleecers than the auto drivers themselves,"" she said.According to Sushmitha, booking bike taxis using apps is also becoming expensive. ""There are multiple instances of bike taxis accepting bookings only after riders agree to pay a tip that ranges from Rs 10 to Rs 40,"" she said.Another passenger, Navneeth J, said, ""Usually, I book an auto from JP Nagar Metro station to Bannerghatta Road. During peak hours, it is difficult to get an auto without paying a tip. There were several instances of auto drivers demanding more money, citing heavy traffic on Outer Ring Road. The app displays a message that 100% of the fare charged goes to auto drivers, but drivers dispute the claims of aggregators.""Shriman Sharma, a techie from Bellandur, said, ""During peak hours, until I add a tip, I do not get a ride. There are days when the fare would be hiked, and they would be asking you for a tip.""Asked about the legality of tips being charged to book an auto, transport commissioner Yogesh AM said, ""The transport department has no say in tipping the drivers while booking autos using a mobile app."" He said the department is contemplating bringing autos under mobile app-based aggregators' rules.","During peak hours, drivers accept bookings only if customers add a tip ranging from rs 10 to rs 80.

Film buff Lewis Hamilton teases exciting movie project alongside Charles Leclerc



Lewis & Charles Reveal Their Biggest Inspirations

Lewis Hamilton has never been one to shy away from the spotlight, whether it's on the Formula 1 track or in the world of entertainment. His passion for film recently took center stage when he recreated an iconic scene from Ferris Bueller’s Day Off. The video, which he shared on his new TikTok account, quickly gained traction, amassing an impressive more than 10 million views. And now, it seems Hamilton is just getting started.Lewis Hamilton's admiration for cinema dates back to his early years, with one particular movie playing a crucial role in shaping his love for Ferrari. ""I love movies. I love film,"" he shared in a recent YouTube video for Ferrari’s Formula 1 team. Ferris Bueller’s Day Off was his first glimpse of a Ferrari, an experience that left a lasting mark. ""Ferris Bueller was actually the first time I saw a Ferrari - I must've been five or six.""The car in question—the legendary 1961 Ferrari 250 GT California Spyder—was a vehicle that ignited his passion for speed. His fascination with racing took root early, and by the age of eight, he was already laying the foundation for his illustrious F1 career.The idea to recreate the famous Ferris Bueller scene had been brewing in Hamilton’s mind for quite some time. ""About a year and a half - maybe two years ago - I started a production company. Me and my friend Timmy were sitting around, just talking, and we started talking about Ferris Bueller. I said, 'How sick would it be if we could reshoot that scene where they're driving the Ferrari over the hill and landing to the Star Wars music?' That idea just never left my mind after I envisioned it.""Through his own production company, Dawn Apollo Films, Hamilton was able to bring his vision to life. The recreation wasn't just about paying tribute to the classic film—it was a project driven by passion, creativity, and meticulous attention to detail. Not only did the video feature cutting-edge technology and high production value, but it also included acclaimed actor Edward Norton alongside Hamilton.""It definitely took a lot of cutting-edge tech, production and planning to get right,"" he admitted on social media. The most critical element, however, was securing the exact car. ""Had to get the exact car too... it's been a dream car since seeing the movie,"" he revealed.With his passion for storytelling flourishing, Hamilton has no plans to stop. Being deeply involved in the upcoming F1 film, he has fully embraced his creative side. And now, he’s already thinking about his next project. ""The next kind of film clip that I'm looking to do is something from an Eddie Murphy movie.""His new Ferrari teammate, Charles Leclerc , who appeared alongside Hamilton in a recent video, was asked what film he’d like to be part of. His answer? Harry Potter—a fitting choice, given that he was once told he resembled the famous wizard. Hamilton wasted no time in brainstorming. ""Maybe I'll do your Harry Potter one first. Maybe I'll do the Harry Potter thing with you!""Also Read: What actually happened to F1 legend Michael Schumacher on December 29, 2013, that completely changed his life? Away from the cameras, both drivers have an important task ahead—the Japanese Grand Prix . After their disqualification in China, Hamilton and Leclerc are eager for a smooth, incident-free race weekend. With crucial championship points on the line, they’ll be looking to make an impact at Suzuka, both on the track and in their growing off-track ventures.","F1 driver lewis hamilton recently recreated a scene from ferris bueller’s day off.

If you’ve been scrolling through social media lately --be it Twitter, Instagram, or TikTok -- you would have surely noticed the Ghibli-style photo trend taking over feeds everywhere. Those dreamy, pastel-hued images of whimsical forests, wide-eyed characters, and soft golden light straight out of a Studio Ghibli film have gone viral, racking up likes, shares, and endless “how did they do that?” comments. It's been almost a week, and this aesthetic obsession shows no signs of slowing down, with creators using AI tools, hand-drawn art, and photo edits to channel the magic of My Neighbor Totoro and Spirited Away. But why stop at static photos? Let’s ride this wave and turn your Ghibli-style masterpieces into an animation video that’ll have your followers hitting “replay.” Here’s a step-by-step guide to help you create a short animation video inspired by the iconic Studio Ghibli aesthetic:The viral buzz started with fans and creators posting Ghibli-inspired snapshots—think lush landscapes and soulful characters, often AI-generated with tools like Midjourney or hand-drawn by digital artists. To join in, you’ll need your own photos ready.Grab or Create Your Images: If you’ve already posted a viral Ghibli-style pic, use that! Otherwise, whip one up with a prompt like “Studio Ghibli-style sunset village, soft colors, detailed” in an AI tool, or sketch it yourself in Procreate.Layer Like a Pro: Split your photo into parts—characters, trees, sky—for animation flexibility. Social media loves those multi-depth shots, and it’s perfect for what’s next.Ghibli’s charm lies in its quiet, heartfelt storytelling, and your animation can capture that—even in a 15-second clip that’s perfect for TikTok’s algorithm.Quick Sketch: Plan a mini-sequence. Maybe your character walks through a glowing forest, or a breeze scatters cherry blossoms. Keep it simple but enchanting—social media thrives on “ooh” moments.Frame Rate Flex: Go for 24 FPS (Ghibli’s cinematic sweet spot). A 10-second viral hit needs 240 frames, but don’t sweat it—software will fill the gaps.To animate Ghibli-style illustrations, you’ll need software that supports frame-by-frame animation, layering, and smooth transitions. Some of the best options include:Adobe After Effects : Ideal for advanced users, offering powerful animation tools and visual effects.Blender: A free, open-source 3D software that allows for detailed animation and rendering.Procreate Dreams: Huge on iPad-toting artists in this trend—hand-draw frames for that authentic Ghibli feel.RunwayML: AI fans love this for interpolating motion between images, cutting down work while keeping it share-worthy.CapCut: Free, fast, and TikTok-friendly for quick edits if you’re new to this.Once you’ve selected your software:Import all your Ghibli-style images into the software.Organize assets by layers (backgrounds, midgrounds, and foregrounds).Group character movements or effects into separate layers for better control.To create smooth animations:Keyframe Animation: Set keyframes at major points to define object positions and movements.Tweening: Fill in the frames between keyframes to achieve smooth transitions.Parallax Effect: Create depth by animating foreground and background layers independently.Studio Ghibli’s charm lies in its attention to environmental details. To replicate this:Add Particle Effects: Animate rain, leaves, or fireflies to create a magical ambiance.Adjust Lighting and Shadows: Use soft, dynamic lighting to evoke different moods.Simulate Camera Movements: Incorporate slow pans, zooms, and tracking shots for a cinematic effect.No Ghibli-inspired animation is complete without a captivating soundtrack.Background Score: Choose soothing, orchestral music that evokes nostalgia and wonder.Ambient Sounds: Add subtle environmental sounds (rustling leaves, chirping birds) for realism.Dialogue and Foley: Sync character speech and sound effects to the animation timeline.After perfecting your animation:Choose the appropriate export settings for your platform.Ensure a high-resolution export (1080p or 4K) for crisp visuals.Test your video for any frame drops or inconsistencies before finalizing.Users must be mindful of copyright restrictions when using AI-generated images, especially for commercial purposes as using copyrighted images as input could raise legal issues.","The ghibli-style photo trend is taking over feeds everywhere.

At the time of writing, over 7,100 complaints had been submitted. Approximately 39% of these reports indicated issues with accessing the X app, while others cited problems with accessing the website and server issue.Many users, including those of The Times of India tech team, attempting to view posts on the X website encountered an error message stating, “Something went wrong.

No trade talks for Will Levis—Titans executive makes stance crystal clear



Will Levis' contract and Titans’ Quarterback strategy



The Tennessee Titans are undergoing significant roster evaluations as they prepare for the 2025 NFL season, aiming to bounce back from a disappointing campaign last year. One of the biggest question marks surrounding the team has been the future of quarterback Will Levis , who struggled throughout the season. Despite speculation about a potential trade, the Titans’ front office has firmly dismissed any such reports, reaffirming their commitment to the young quarterback.Following a lackluster 2024 season in which Levis threw 13 touchdowns against 12 interceptions and totaled 2,091 passing yards, many expected the Titans to move on from the 24-year-old signal-caller. With Tennessee securing the No. 1 overall pick in the upcoming NFL Draft, speculation has been rife that the team could be eyeing a quarterback such as Miami’s Cam Ward to revitalize their offense. However, Titans President of Football Operations Chad Brinker made it clear that Levis is very much in their plans moving forward.“That’s a false report. We have not contacted anybody, and nobody has contacted us about Will Levis… The plan with Will Levis is that he has a chance to compete for a starting job next year, just like every player on our roster. It’s no different for Will,” Brinker emphasized during an interview with Jim Wyatt.Brinker’s statement effectively silenced rumors of a potential trade and provided a clear indication that Levis will enter training camp as a legitimate contender for the starting quarterback position. While Levis has faced his share of struggles, the Titans’ offensive woes were not solely his responsibility, as the team ranked 27th in total offense last season. The franchise appears committed to giving him a fair shot at proving himself once again.Levis remains under contract with the Titans through 2026, with the team owing him $5.6 million over the next two seasons. In 2025, he is set to earn $2.6 million, with a slight increase to just over $3 million in the final year of his four-year, $9.5 million rookie contract. Given his affordable salary, the Titans may see value in keeping him as a potential long-term option rather than rushing to replace him immediately.Brinker further reinforced this commitment by highlighting Levis' work ethic and determination to improve. “I see him in our facility, he’s working hard. Everybody knows he’s a great kid, he’s a hard worker, and he’s going to give it everything he has. We’re going to continue to work with Will Levis.”Despite Tennessee’s high draft position and the growing buzz around selecting a new quarterback, Brinker’s words suggest that Levis will be given every opportunity to compete. Whether or not the Titans draft a new signal-caller, Levis’ ability to perform in preseason and training camp will ultimately determine his future as the potential franchise quarterback.Also Read: Dogfighting case: Nearly 200 dogs seized from ex-NFL RB LeShon Johnson, the largest federal seizure from one individual For now, the message from the Titans' leadership is clear: Will Levis isn’t going anywhere, and he’ll have a fair shot at proving himself in 2025.","Tennessee titans president of football operations chad brinker dismissed rumors of a potential trade for quarterback will levis.

Trump’s tariff shock may boost Indian auto parts exports,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-tariff-shock-may-boost-indian-auto-parts-exports/articleshow/119768940.cms,".

The author has an IIT-IIM education and over 20 years of experience leading auto parts and manufacturing companies in India and abroad.

Spoiler alert—the 25% tariff imposed on auto and auto parts is likely to have little negative impact on India. Automobile tariffs would take effect from April 3, and tariffs on auto parts would take effect ""no later than May 3, 2025,"" according to MEMA, the Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association of the USA.Firstly, on automobiles, India’s total exports to the US, at around $10 million, would roughly equate to a rounding error in Japan’s automobile exports to the US and is completely insignificant.On automobile parts, India is a more serious contender, with $2.2 billion in exports to the US, comprising nearly 30% of India’s total automobile component exports. But placed in context, this is under 3% of the US' total automobile parts imports. This is not really what Donald Trump is targeting but could become collateral damage in his assault on the big exporters of parts to the US—Canada, Mexico, China, and others.However, the likelihood of being collateral damage is minimal. The 25% tariff is being applied uniformly to all countries, so every nation’s competitive advantage is impacted equally. Auto parts companies in India do not fear being underpriced by competitors on this account. What they do fear is pressure from importers to absorb at least a part of the cost, thereby eroding profitability significantly. Some companies anticipating this possibility have already started a cost-reduction drive.The other possible threat is local manufacturers in the US using this shield of 25% to set up production in the US and outprice imports. This is probable against high-cost countries like Germany, Japan, and Canada, which would lose out completely to US manufacturers. However, the equation is different in the case of low-cost countries like India, Vietnam, China, and some East European nations. Even with the 25% advantage, US manufacturers would find it challenging to match the prices of components from low-cost nations.The reason is that the cost advantage enjoyed by low-cost countries due to labour arbitrage is not in percentages but in orders of magnitude. While a worker in auto components is paid Rs 30,000 to 40,000 per month in India, a typical US worker would be paid at least $4,000 per month. This translates to a 10:1 cost advantage in labour, but the wage advantage is offset by higher productivity in the US. This could be anywhere between 2:1 and 3:1. This is not because workers in the US work three times as quickly as Indians. Human productivity due to physique is a factor, and machine speed is another, but what is significant in the productivity difference is automation. This results in man-machine ratios that could be 1:2 or 1:3 in the US versus 1:1 in India.Additionally, Indian companies tend to employ larger numbers of indirect labour compared to the US, where material movement and other indirect activities have a larger element of automation. This extends even to factory staff. Factory management productivity is higher in the US due to leaner organisations. Indian factory managements typically tend to have more supervisors and middle management. However, even after offsetting the productivity advantage of the US, India would have a labour advantage versus the US, with total human costs being anywhere between 300% higher or more.After this, there is the consideration of what percentage of the total cost the human cost comprises to determine the impact on total cost. In this, we need to club all three categories—direct labour, indirect labour, and staff salaries. All this put together would normally be at a minimum of 12–15% of the total cost, even in material-intensive products. If the total labour cost advantage is 300%, then the total cost advantage would still be 45%. This can be calculated for illustration as follows: The Indian product would be 85+15, versus the US product’s 85+60, so Indian products have some cushion against US products even after the 25% tariff.This calculation is only for illustration, as there are cases where the total human cost is as much as 40%, making it well-nigh impossible for local US companies to compete. However, if there is a double whammy in terms of very low labour content and abysmally low productivity, then that company could lose out, as the OEMs would expect at least a 10% advantage for importing products versus buying locally. However, in most cases, the 25% advantage, even clubbed with the 10% cost differential sought by OEMs, can be overcome by Indian companies.Another factor that should make Indian exporters comfortable is that US manufacturers would be wary of setting up capacity to take on Indian products, not knowing how far we can go in dropping prices. This is in addition to the fact that these low-cost imports represent a relatively smaller slice of the market. Local manufacturers would first look at the low-hanging fruit, i.e., large volumes of high-cost imports from high-cost nations.However, instead of looking at this defensively as to how we can protect our position, the administration should be looking at how this situation can be used as an opportunity to aggressively expand our exports to the US by striking a deal. Why this should be a difficult exercise, given the above cost factors, is baffling. Even if the duties on every single manufactured product from the US were reduced to zero, US products could not outprice Indian products.US products will be bought for value, not price. If the duty on a Harley-Davidson, for instance, is reduced to zero, there is unlikely to be even one buyer of a TVS Apache or Bajaj Pulsar who would switch to a Harley. Similarly, even the lowest model of a Tesla couldn’t compete on price against Indian cars. The same is true for every other product I know of. The government's tariffs are not meant to protect Indian manufacturers but to generate revenue from the “rich” buyers of these products (“If someone wants a Harley, he will pay twice the price to get it”). Soaking the rich in this context is outdated thinking from the Nehru era, which has no place today, either in economics or, as here, in geopolitics.In conclusion, while the 25% tariff poses little threat to Indian auto component makers, it provides an opportunity the government should seize and capitalise on. The question is whether they will rise to the occasion. From 1947 to 1990, India saw the dark ages until the P V Narasimha Rao-Manmohan Singh government. They were up against the wall but used the crisis well to liberalise the economy.India then saw an inflection point. We can hope that the present government will do the same under compulsion. It should, as it has taken several steps to promote Indian manufacturing in the past. As Winston Churchill (or Rahm Emanuel) said, “Never let a good crisis go to waste.” So, Trump’s tariffs could well be good news and another inflection point for the Indian economy.","The 25% tariff imposed on auto and auto parts is likely to have little negative impact on india.

As dawn breaks over Jebel Ali Port , the synchronised movements of cranes and the steady flow of cargo vessels highlight Dubai 's emergence as a global logistics hub. Once a vital transit point between East and West, the city is now actively shaping the future of global supply chains with cutting-edge technology, infrastructure, and government-backed smart trade initiatives.At the heart of this transformation is a flourishing trade relationship with India—one that is not only rooted in history but is now accelerating into the future, powered by AI-driven logistics, automation, and free trade agreements.For centuries, India and Dubai have shared a strong economic relationship, and today, that connection is being redefined by innovation. The UAE-India Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), signed in 2022, eliminated tariffs on over 10,000 products and set a goal to increase non-oil trade to $100 billion by 2030 But beyond trade figures, Dubai offers Indian logistics firms something even more valuable—a world-class supply chain ecosystem, a thriving free trade environment, and an AI-powered logistics infrastructure that makes global expansion seamless.""India holds great strategic importance for DP World,"" said Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, Group Chairman and CEO of DP World. ""We have invested over $2.5 billion in the country’s logistics ecosystem to enhance domestic and global connectivity.”This commitment to enhancing India-UAE trade routes has positioned Dubai as a springboard for Indian logistics companies seeking global reach.Dubai’s logistics infrastructure is built for speed, scale, and efficiency. The Jebel Ali Port , one of the world's largest and busiest container ports, and Jebel Ali Free Zone ( Jafza ), which houses over 10,700 multinational companies, create a seamless supply chain network, reducing logistics costs and optimising operations.For Indian logistics startups, this presents a strategic advantage—access to a globally connected hub with state-of-the-art AI-driven solutions.“Many enterprises struggle with visibility into their logistics costs. They don’t always know how much they are spending or where inefficiencies lie,” says Deepesh Kuruppath, Founder & CEO of CargoFL, a supply chain AI platform. “In Dubai, we have found the perfect ecosystem to introduce AI-driven optimisations for large enterprises.”CargoFL’s platform identifies inefficiencies in a company’s supply chain and provides automation and digitisation solutions. With advanced AI-driven analytics, companies can save up to 10% on logistics costs, according to Kuruppath.Dubai has transformed to be a logistics and innovation hub. The city’s leadership in AI, automation, and blockchain technology is creating one of the most sophisticated digital supply chain ecosystems in the world.Government initiatives like the Dubai Silk Road strategy and the Dubai AI Strategy have transformed the logistics sector, making it easier for businesses to automate supply chain processes, track shipments in real-time, and optimize freight movements using predictive analytics.""We recognise the critical role the logistics sector plays in enabling the growth of industries globally,"" said Abdulla Bin Damithan, CEO and Managing Director of DP World UAE & Jafza . ""As the UAE continues to grow into a global processing and re-distribution gateway, we have experienced a significant spike in demand for logistics and warehousing space.”For companies like Fero.AI, Dubai is the ideal testing ground for logistics automation. “We operate in one of the most advanced trade ecosystems in the world,” says Abhinav Chaudhary, CEO and Founder of Fero.AI. “Dubai’s logistics infrastructure, combined with government-backed smart trade initiatives, has allowed us to integrate AI-powered solutions efficiently.”Fero.AI specialises in automating freight and supply chain processes and collaborates with DP World to implement AI-driven logistics solutions. The company sees Dubai as a perfect platform to introduce cutting-edge logistics automation technologies.Dubai’s free zones have made the emirate one of the most attractive destinations for Indian logistics firms. Jafza, for instance, offers - 100% foreign ownership, zero import/export duties, unrestricted currency repatriation, and simplified business setup processes.” For an Indian company, setting up in Jafza is almost seamless,"" says Kuruppath of CargoFL. “You don’t face the tax burdens and operational complexities that exist elsewhere. Dubai’s free zones are designed for logistics companies to thrive.”Jafza is expanding its logistics capacity with the development of the Jafza Logistics Park, a multi-tenant warehousing facility in the Jebel Ali Free Zone. Phase 1 of the project, which was scheduled for completion in 2023, was successfully completed as of November 2024.""We are building the Jafza Logistics Park in response to increasing demand and to further boost the development of the UAE’s logistics sector,"" added Damithan of DP World UAE & Jafza.With fast-track business licensing, cutting-edge warehousing facilities, and streamlined customs processes, Jafza has become a magnet for Indian logistics and supply chain companies.As India’s economy expands and Dubai cements its status as a global logistics hub, the partnership between the two regions is set to grow exponentially.“We are at the beginning of a major shift,” says Kuruppath of CargoFL. “Dubai is no longer just a transit hub—it is a technology hub. AI, automation, and smart logistics are redefining how supply chains function, and Indian companies have an opportunity to be at the forefront of this transformation.”For Indian logistics firms looking to scale globally, optimize costs, and tap into AI-driven supply chain solutions, the message is clear:Dubai is not just a bridge between East and West—it is the future of global logistics.Click this link for more on Business in Dubai.This article is a part of a featured content series on Business in Dubai.","Dubai has transformed to be a logistics and innovation hub.

Trump auto tariffs impact: Tata Motors shares declined 6.31% to Rs 663 during early trading hours on Thursday, following the announcement by US President Donald Trump regarding implementation of 25% tariff on imported cars and light trucks starting next week.The United States of America is a significant market for Jaguar Land Rover , contributing 22% of total sales according to JLR's annual report for the 2024 financial year.At 10:54 AM, Tata Motors shares were trading at Rs 675.65, down Rs 32 or 4.56% on the Bombay Stock Exchange. Tata Motors' stock has experienced a decline of 28.18% and lagged behind its sector's performance by 33.35% during the previous year.

"PNB plans to step up service, boost retail & farm lending",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/pnb-plans-to-step-up-service-boost-retail-farm-lending/articleshow/119771680.cms,"NEW DELHI: Punjab National Bank (PNB) , the country's second largest public sector lender, is set to step up its focus on customer service as well as retail, agriculture and MSME lending , while targeting corporate loans that give higher returns, the bank's new MD and CEO Ashok Chandra told TOI.Chandra, who took over in Jan, is working with his team to deploy a QR code-based feedback system for all customer-facing employees with each staff member required to receive at least 50 such reviews. ""Customer service is one area where we must step up and therefore it will be our top priority. Customer feedback will be part of the annual assessment of each employee,"" he said.The HR department is working on the module which is expected to be rolled out from May. Already, Canara Bank, where Chandra was executive director, has rolled out the facility. Chandra said that better customer service improves deposit flow, as he pitches PNB to be the primary bank for most retail customers, some of whom may have multiple accounts.Besides, increasing the share of current accounts and savings account (CASA) balances in the total deposit base of the bank will be a thrust, given that its share has dropped to around 38% at the end of Dec, compared with 42.5% in Dec 2023.While Chandra intends to step up engagement with the top 100 companies to ensure that PNB can meet their requirements, he is also going to be selective when it comes to lending.""Low yielding advances don't generate good income. We are the second largest bank but rank fifth in terms of operating profit. So, we need to be very mindful of the opportunities in the system and pricing is an important criterion for corporate loans.""The new PNB chief has also pushed his colleagues from the head office into the field, whether it is to boost lending or step up recovery. ""Slippages are under control, but we can improve recovery (of bad debt),"" he said, adding that one time loan settlement is being pursued.","Punjab national bank (pnb) is set to step up its focus on customer service as well as retail, agriculture and msme lending.

Government looks at 360-degree incentives for key sectors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/government-looks-at-360-degree-incentives-for-key-sectors/articleshow/119771339.cms,"NEW DELHI: Wiser by the initial experience with production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme, govt is now looking at a more comprehensive approach for champion sectors, complete with a package for inputs, skilling and other aspects.Govt sources told TOI that ministries that were pitching for new sectors under the PLI scheme have been asked to go back to the drawing board and redraw the scheme, taking a 360-degree view.Footwear, toys, textiles and speciality chemicals were among a host of sectors that were vying to be included under the scheme that targets to develop a large production base within the country to meet domestic and export demand. On its part, govt provides incentives if there is an annual increase in production in line with the targets.Mobile phones have been the biggest success story among the 14 sectors where PLI was launched five years ago as part of govt's Atma Nirbhar Bharat initiative . While production of phones and related accessories has increased, with the likes of Apple bringing a large part of its vendor base to India, the import of components from China has continued unabated, and has only increased.Based on the learnings, the new component scheme was cleared by the Union Cabinet on Friday.Officials said that a similar approach is being contemplated for new sectors. For instance, in case of footwear, while global giants are looking to significantly step up sourcing from India to de-risk their production, but they find that inputs required are unavailable, for which they have to again rely on China.Several of the players are also looking to get some of their vendors to set up shop in India so that the entire ecosystem is there, and the synergies help lower costs.The tweaks that have been discussed at the highest level mean that there may be a need to increase the allocation for some of the new sectors that are included against the earlier assessment that the ""surplus"" or ""unutilised"" funds from the Rs 1.97 lakh crore allocated for the 14 sectors covered by PLI can be used.","Ministers pitching for new sectors under the pli scheme have been asked to go back to the drawing board and redraw the scheme.
