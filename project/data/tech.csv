Ethanol-blended petrol push: PIL in Supreme Court challenges nationwide sale of E20; claims 'engines are suffering',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ethanol-blended-petrol-push-pil-in-supreme-court-challenges-nationwide-sale-of-e20-claims-engines-are-suffering/articleshow/123457552.cms,"India's E20 Push



Is all petrol in India now E20?



How is E20 different from E10 or E15?



What impact does E20 have on vehicles?



What Government said?



NEW DELHI: A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has been filed in the Supreme Court against the nationwide rollout of 20% Ethanol Blended Petrol (E20), claiming that millions of motorists are being forced to use fuel their vehicles are not designed for.The plea, filed by advocate Akshay, has sought directions to the Ministry of Petroleum & Natural Gas to ensure ethanol-free petrol (E0) is made available at all fuel stations across the country.The PIL argues that cars and two-wheelers manufactured before 2023 and even some newer BS-VI models, are not compatible with high ethanol blends like E20.""Direct the respondents to ensure that consumers are informed about ethanol compatibility of their vehicles at the time of fuel dispensing. Engines are suffering corrosion, fuel efficiency is dropping, and repair bills are mounting, while insurance companies are rejecting claims for damage caused by ethanol fuel,"" the plea stated.The petitioner further sought clear labelling of ethanol content at all petrol pumps and dispensing units so that consumers are fully informed about what they are purchasing.The petition highlighted that global practices differ sharply.In countries like the US and EU, ethanol-free petrol continues to be widely available, and pumps clearly display the ethanol content.In India, however, only ethanol-blended petrol is sold, and there is no disclosure of composition at dispensing units, the plea added.India has accelerated its transition to E20 fuel, a blend of 20% ethanol and 80% petrol, as part of its efforts to cut carbon emissions and reduce dependence on imported crude oil.The nationwide rollout, originally planned for 2030, has now been advanced to 2025. While the government has set ambitious targets, questions remain over the availability of compatible vehicles, supply logistics, and consumer awareness.Not yet. Many petrol pumps are still offering E10 (10% ethanol), while E20 is being gradually introduced in select regions. The government’s aim is to achieve 100% E20 availability across India by 2025.The number indicates the ethanol percentage in the fuel blend. For example, E10 has 10% ethanol, E15 has 15%, and E20 contains 20%. The higher the ethanol content, the lower the reliance on crude oil imports.According to several reports, many motorists have expressed concerns about the impact of E20 fuel, particularly on fuel efficiency.While ethanol has lower energy density than petrol, the mileage impact is relatively small. For E10 vehicles tuned for E20, the drop is just 1-2% .In other vehicles, the reduction could range between 3-6% and even that can be minimised with proper engine tuning, as reported by ANI.The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas issued a statement rejecting all viral social media posts alleging that E20 causes a major fall in fuel efficiency.Calling the claims ""factually incorrect,"" the ministry said they lack any scientific backing or expert validation.","A public interest litigation (pil) has been filed in the supreme court against the rollout of 20% ethanol blended petrol (e20) the plea, filed by advocate akshay, has sought directions to the ministry of petroleum & natural gas to ensure ethanol-free petrol (e0) is made available at all fuel stations across the country.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123458210,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-58496,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Isro unveiled a model of the Bharatiya Antariksh Station (BAS) module, on the occassion of the national Space Day celebrations held at Bharat Mandapam on Friday.The BAS, which will be India’s first home-built space station, is set to have its first module launched by 2028. This will place India among a select group of countries operating orbital laboratories.At present, there are only two such stations in service, the International Space Station, run jointly by five space agencies, and China’s Tiangong space station.Under its long-term plan, India aims to assemble five modules of the BAS by 2035 as part of its ambitious space programme, PTI reported.The first unit, BAS-01, is expected to weigh 10 tonnes and will orbit at an altitude of 450 km above Earth. Standing 3.8 metres in diameter and 8 metres in length, the model of BAS-01 was the star attraction at the National Space Day event.The BAS will come with several key features. These include an indigenously developed Environmental Control and Life Support System (ECLSS), a Bharat Docking System, Bharat Berthing Mechanism, automated hatch systems, platforms for microgravity research and technology demonstration, as well as viewports designed for scientific imaging and crew recreation.It will also provide refuelling capabilities for propulsion and ECLSS fluids, alongside radiation, thermal and Micro Meteoroid Orbital Debris (MMOD) protection. Other features include space suits, airlocks to support extra-vehicular activities, and plug-and-play integrated avionics.The BAS will serve as a research platform for studying space, life sciences, medicine and interplanetary exploration. It will enable scientists to observe the effects of microgravity on human health while testing technologies vital for long-term human presence in space.The station will also open doors to space tourism, with India planning to tap into the commercial space sector by leveraging the resources of its orbital lab.In addition to fostering international collaboration, the BAS is expected to inspire future generations to take up careers in space science and technology.India’s space sector is stepping into a new era of growth and innovation, with reforms giving private players a greater role while freeing Isro to push the boundaries of advanced research and deep space exploration, senior government official P K Mishra said on Friday.Mishra, who is the principal secretary to the prime minister, highlighted how the government’s reforms have changed the outlook for the industry.""Space sector reforms have made the future of the sector scalable, innovative and resilient,"" he said.He explained that technology transfers from Isro, creation of a venture capital fund and a technology adoption fund are driving transformation in the sector.""Isro is now free to focus on frontier technologies and deep space, much of the application will be done by the private sector which is developing,"" Mishra said.Highlighting the need to integrate cutting-edge tools into space missions, he urged scientists to embrace artificial intelligence, quantum computing and big data analytics for future satellites and ground systems.Mishra also called for deeper international cooperation, pointing to recent collaborations such as the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) satellite launch and the proposed G-20 climate satellite.""India should be seen as a hub of affordable, inclusive and innovative space solutions for the world,"" he said, as cited by PTI.He concluded by stressing that the country’s space journey is not only about science and technology but also about national progress. India’s space efforts, he said, are aimed at empowering citizens, reducing inequalities, and building a confident, self-reliant nation.","Isro unveiled a model of the bharatiya antariksh station (bas) module on friday.

NEW DELHI: India is now finally getting set to kick off the collaboration with France to co-develop a new powerful jet engine for its indigenous fifth-generation stealth fighter and other futuristic platforms, which will further bolster the already expansive strategic partnership between the two countries.Defence Research and Development Organisation will soon move the cabinet committee on security for the approval of the ambitious project with French major Safran, with 100% transfer of technology, to jointly design, develop, test, qualify, certify and produce the new 120 kilonewton engines in India, senior officials told TOI.""DRDO has cleared the proposal by Safran, which already makes a variety of helicopter engines in India, as the best option for the twin-engine fifth-generation fighter called AMCA (advanced medium combat aircraft). The project, with DRDO's lab Gas Turbine Research Establishment, would cost almost $7 billion,"" an official said.Defence minister Rajnath Singh, speaking at The Economic Times World Leaders Forum Friday, also confirmed the impending project. ""We have taken steps forward to build our fifth-generation fighter aircraft. We have also moved towards manufacturing the aircraft's engine in India itself. We are about to start engine manufacturing work in India with the French company Safran,"" Singh said.India's inability to manufacture an aero-engine, with the requisite thrust-to-weight ratio, has for long been a major hurdle for indigenous fighter jet programmes.The almost two-year delay in delivery of 99 GE-F404 turbofan engines by US firm General Electric, which HAL contracted for Rs 5,375 crore in Aug 2021, as well as weapons and radar integration issues, for instance, are the main reasons for the major slowdown in production of Tejas Mark-1A fighters.Hindustan Aeronautics and GE are also yet to seal the final deal for the co-production of the GE-F414 engines in the 98 kilonewton thrust class in India, with 80% of transfer of technology for around $1.5 billion, to power the planned Tejas Mark-2 variant.""The project for jet engine with Safran will have full IP (intellectual property) ownership & licencing control by India. It will create an entire ecosystem for the manufacture of aero-engines in India, with complete supply chain development,"" an official said.This comes after the defence ministry in May finally approved a new ""programme execution model"" for prototype development of the 25-tonne AMCA, with greater private sector participation.As per existing timelines, the AMCA with the requisite thrust-to-weight ratio, advanced sensor fusion and stealth features like an internal weapons bay and ""serpentine air-intake"" will be ready for production only by 2035.IAF plans to induct seven squadrons (126 jets) of the expensive AMCA, with the first two squadrons powered by the American GE-F414 engines and the next five with 120 kilonewton engines.","Defence research and development organisation will soon move the cabinet committee on security for the approval of the ambitious project with french major safran.

I have been engaged with industry in India, I have been engaged with companies from US working in India. Everybody believes that it is an important relationship."" He added that businesses were also exploring alternatives and had supported the govt's stand.Goyal further pointed to several trade agreements that have been concluded, noting that like Australia, UK and EFTA nations, European Union too had recognised India's sensitivities in certain sectors. He said there had been good progress on proposed free trade agreement with the EU, while assuring that India's interests would always be safeguarded.""Geopolitical considerations, or wanting to look good, will never drive India's trade decisions. Trade will stand on its own legs, geopolitics stands on its own legs, we don't hyphenate the two. Our effort is to build good relations across the world; we are multilateral in every dimension.

Is Roblox shutting down?



""While this was not an easy choice, we believe it is in the best interest of our community. We want to thank everyone who has been part of this journey. Your voices have been heard, and your well-being remains our top priority.""

""Effective September Ist, the platform will no longer be available,""

What can lead to Roblox finally being shut down in 2025?



A viral notice that claims Roblox will shut down on September 1, 2025, permanently has ignited a panic among its players. The message in the notice cited Roblox safety concerns and the popular demand for the platform to shut down, as the reasons behind their step. This notice that now seems to be all over X, and gaining a lot of attention, is coming at a time when Roblox is facing legal scrutiny and international bans. So, is this the end of the popular gaming platform, or is it just a part of the recurring hoax?Here is all we know about the circulating news and whether or not it is officially true.An official-looking announcement, stating Roblox is shutting down, has spread rapidly on X. It states that Roblox made a decision to shut down permanently from September 1, 2025, due to user demand and security concerns. The official announcement further stated,While the announcement that seemed to be official, stated,there is still no news of whether or not it is true. Quite crucially, no official confirmation has been received about this from Roblox. Fans are, therefore, speculating, it is just a hoax, like all the other times before. So, until any confirmation is received, one can relax and continue playing their favorite on the platform.This is not the first time that rumors of Roblox shutting down have surfaced all over social media. In the past, news about Roblox being shut down has spread and repeatedly, those were denied. The claims of Roblox shutdown were called rumors, and a hoax.The platform gave reassurances to the players that the game “isn’t going anywhere.”What’s interesting about the current circulating claims is that Roblox has been under a lot of pressure. From demands for the Roblox CEO resignation to changes in their policies and even the drop in the share price of Roblox, fans speculate that this time, the news can be true. Even the lack of denial or immediate confirmation from the end of Roblox is quite unusual. It has left this situation ambiguous, with players awaiting an official statement soon.While Roblox isn’t any stranger to controversies, the recent lawsuits against the platform by the state of Louisiana, accusing it of failing to protect the young crowd from inappropriate content and predators, have taken a major toll. Games like Public Bathroom Simulator Vibe, Escape to Epstein Island and Diddy Party have also been cited as examples of Roblox explicit content that have been accessible to minors.The lawsuit was not an isolated incident. Many countries, including Turkey, China, and Oman, have banned the platform. Now with Qatar's recent Roblox ban, after social media pushing to take action, over the platform's rising child safety concerns, have brought a lot of Roblox legal troubles. Critics argue that the rapid growth of Roblox has outpaced the platform’s ability to enforce needed moderation. While Roblox did bring in safety measures, including Roblox AI monitoring, there are many who believe all these measures are just reactive and not preventative.In short, with the Roblox international bans, lawsuits, and the player-led boycotts, like #BoycottTheHatch,” Roblox has been facing mounting pressure. The recent viral notice circulating about Roblox shutting down—whether fake or real—shows increased frustration amongst the users, critics and concerned citizens. Whether or not it is true, only time would tell.As of now, the gaming platform remains operational, with millions of gamers aiming for it to be the same. However, the company being silent on the latest rumors is quite concerning. In case the legal actions do succeed, some stricter regulations can force major changes or, worse, can make the platform back off by finally shutting it down.","A viral notice that claims roblox will shut down on september 1, 2025, permanently has ignited a panic among its players.

Alleged Discord conversations between Destiny and Rose gain traction

Destiny responds: “She told me she was 19”

Steven Kenneth Bonnell II, better known as Destiny, has become the center of controversy after serious allegations emerged online. The popular streamer and political commentator is being accused of sharing sexually explicit messages with an individual identified as “Rose,” who was allegedly 17 at the time of their interactions.On August 20, 2025, Kick streamershared screenshots from Destiny’s own chatroom that appeared to show him referencing Rose while taunting critics. In the leaked posts, Destiny dismissed concerns that he was “hiding stuff” and even mentioned details about Rose’s college, which many claimed could have led to her being doxed.The casual tone of his remarks only fueled speculation. Critics argued that his comments revealed not only recklessness but also a pattern of minimizing accusations against him.Later that same day, additional screenshots circulated online, this time allegedly from Discord. Shared by user @KweenInYellow, the messages appeared to show explicit exchanges between Destiny and Rose dating back to 2022.The screenshots, if accurate, included sexual references and raised alarm because of Rose’s reported age at the time.These images spread rapidly across X and Reddit, with fans and critics dissecting their authenticity.Some pointed out that dates and usernames seemed consistent with Destiny’s past accounts, while others cautioned against drawing conclusions without verified sources.As the storm escalated, Destiny addressed the allegations in his own chatroom on August 20. He claimed Rose had told him she was 19 at the time of their conversations and insisted there were logs that could back up his version.He also pointed to claims that Rose had produced large amounts of adult content, arguing that this complicated the narrative being pushed against him.The allegations have dominated online discussions in the streaming world, with reactions deeply divided. Some people are in favor of Destiny and are backing the streamers with facts and their own theories, while others are thrashing him all over social media for his questionable actions with minors.As of this writing, there has been no official action from any official body against Destiny. However, social media has been buzzing with their perspectives on the matter.","Steven kenneth bonnell ii, better known as destiny, has become the center of controversy after serious allegations emerged online.

Poll Do you support the new Online Gaming Bill, 2025? Yes, it’s necessary No, it’s too restrictive

Fantasy sports giant Dream11 on Friday announced that it has discontinued all paid contests on its platform and will now operate solely as a free-to-play online social game, in the backdrop of The Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill.In a statement released late on Friday, the company said, “This morning, we stopped all paid contests on Dream11 and pivoted entirely to a free-to-play online social game.”The new law, which received President Droupadi Murmu’s assent earlier in the day, prohibits all forms of money-based online gaming while providing recognition and support for e-sports and online social games. The legislation carries stringent penalties for companies that fail to comply, including imprisonment of up to three years and fines of up to ₹1 crore.Dream11, founded 18 years ago, said its journey was driven by the vision to improve sports engagement in India. “When we started this journey 18 years ago as a Sports Tech company, we were not even 1% of the size of the USA Fantasy Sports industry. Dream11’s Fantasy Sports product was our way to ‘Make Sports Better’ for all of India,” the company said, adding that it had since grown into the world’s largest fantasy sports platform.The company underlined that it has always conducted business in compliance with the law. “While we believe that progressive regulations would have been the right way forward, we will respect the law and will fully comply with ‘The Promotion & Regulation of Online Gaming Law, 2025’,” the statement read.Officials said the government will notify the effective date of the legislation in due course, while rules under the bill are being drafted. “As the bill is structured, even without rules, there are certain provisions that can come into force immediately. But that is a decision we will take,” MeitY Secretary S Krishnan told ANI.Dream11 highlighted that it continues to operate several other sports-tech ventures under its parent group, including FanCode, DreamSetGo and Dream Game Studios. “These will continue to power our vision to ‘Make Sports Better’ and support our Hon’ble Prime Minister’s ambition of making India a global sporting superpower,” the company said.Signing off, the platform thanked users for their support and added: “See you in our second innings.”Earlier, My11Circle also ceased operations with the Online Gaming Bill getting passed in the Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha. They said on social media, ""In line with the new regulations, Games24x7 is suspending real money games on My11Circle. Our commitment to the law remains strong, and we’ll continue to prioritise our players with smooth withdrawals and future updates.""",Fantasy sports giant dream11 has discontinued all paid contests on its platform.

Minnesota Wild commit to Marco Rossi with 3-year, $15 million NHL contract

Impact of Marco Rossi’s contract on Minnesota Wild’s NHL roster decisions and future

The Minnesota Wild have re-signed restricted free agent center Marco Rossi to a three-year, $15 million contract, ending months of speculation about his future with the franchise. The deal carries a $5 million annual cap hit and comes after Rossi’s breakout season, where he established himself as one of Minnesota’s most important young forwards. The extension also provides the Wild stability as they navigate critical roster decisions moving forward.Rossi, 23, was coming off his entry-level contract and entered restricted free agency this summer amid trade rumors and questions about the Wild’s willingness to invest in him long term. Drafted ninth overall by Minnesota in 2020, Rossi posted career-best numbers last season with 24 goals and 36 assists for 60 points in 82 games. His production ranked second on the team in scoring behind Matt Boldy’s 73 points and placed him third in goals, trailing Boldy (27) and Kirill Kaprizov (25).Despite the uncertainty, Minnesota general manager Bill Guerin repeatedly emphasized Rossi’s importance to the club, stating he would match any potential offer sheet.Instead of extending negotiations into training camp, both sides agreed to a three-year bridge contract that balances Rossi’s rising value with the team’s cap flexibility.The signing puts an end to months of speculation that Rossi could be moved after his name surfaced in trade talks around last season’s deadline. By securing the young center, the Wild strengthened their top-six forward group while buying time to evaluate Rossi’s continued development before a longer-term deal.The timing of the extension is also significant for Minnesota’s broader roster outlook. By committing to Marco Rossi on a three-year, $15 million contract, the Wild ensured stability at center while maintaining salary cap flexibility. This move allows Rossi to continue developing into a consistent offensive presence as Minnesota looks to build on its 97-point season that ended in a first-round playoff loss to the Vegas Golden Knights.By securing Marco Rossi, the Wild have solidified their core and ended months of uncertainty about one of their brightest young players. The deal gives Rossi a chance to further prove himself while allowing Minnesota flexibility as they prepare for critical decisions on Kaprizov and the team’s long-term direction.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Seattle Kraken linked to trade talks for Minnesota Wild’s Marco Rossi","The minnesota wild have re-signed restricted free agent center marco rossi to a three-year, $15 million contract.

Unconventional leadership and office creativity

Monthly “work church” meetings with grammar lessons

Other companies embracing unconventional office setups



A billionaire breaking the mold

Judy Faulkner, the 82-year-old CEO of Epic Systems, has built a remarkable $7.8 billion fortune through her 43% stake in the company, yet she has never taken a single share for personal use. Instead, she has committed to giving away nearly all her wealth to philanthropic causes, signing Bill Gates’ Giving Pledge in 2015 to donate 99% of her fortune. Beyond finances, Faulkner has created a corporate culture that values creativity, curiosity, and learning. From whimsical themed office buildings to innovative company-wide gatherings, she proves that leadership and generosity can coexist, while setting an example for other business leaders that success can be measured not only in profits but also in positive impact on employees and society.Faulkner, together with her husband, launched Roots & Wings to provide grants to nonprofits dedicated to improving the health, education, and well-being of children and families. Since its inception, the foundation has grown into a major philanthropic vehicle: in 2020, it granted $15 million to 115 organizations, and by 2024, it projected $67 million in grants to 305 nonprofits nationwide. Faulkner intends to steadily expand giving, aiming to distribute $100 million annually by 2027. To responsibly manage the sale of her non-voting Epic shares without destabilizing the company, she established a trust that governs these transactions. This careful planning ensures that her philanthropic mission can continue without affecting Epic’s stability or long-term growth.Epic Systems’ 1,670-acre campus in Wisconsin is far from a conventional office environment. Its 28 buildings feature fantastical themes ranging from Harry Potter and Alice in Wonderland to The Wizard of Oz, organized into mini-campuses such as Prairie Campus, Wizards Academy, and Storybook Campus. Inside, employees help source artwork and whimsical installations, including chocolate chip trails leading to a mock chocolate factory, hanging bridges to treehouses, and magical sculptures scattered across the grounds. This imaginative setting reflects Faulkner’s philosophy that creativity, play, and aesthetic engagement foster learning and productivity, making the workplace not just a location for tasks but a space for inspiration and collaboration.Once a month, Epic employees gather in the underground auditorium called Deep Space for a mandatory meeting affectionately nicknamed “work church.” These gatherings cover essential business news, company updates, and operational targets. Yet Faulkner adds unique elements that transform standard corporate meetings into engaging learning experiences. For instance, she incorporates grammar lessons, teaching employees proper usage of words such as “who” and “whom,” and emphasizing communication skills alongside company strategy. By blending education with corporate updates, these meetings reinforce a culture of continuous learning, intellectual curiosity, and attention to detail, encouraging employees to grow professionally and personally within the company. Her story demonstrates that visionary leadership can redefine both corporate culture and philanthropy on a global scale.Epic Systems is part of a broader trend of companies reimagining office culture to enhance employee engagement. Wellstar Health System, for example, offers wellness rooms with massage chairs, calming music, and healthy snacks, resulting in a 10% drop in employee turnover in 2024. Nonprofit Understood designs offices specifically for neurodivergent employees, with adjustable lighting, temperature zones, and assistive listening systems to support diverse needs. Even CEOs like Jeff Bezos favor “messy meetings” over rehearsed discussions to stimulate open debate and creativity. These examples show that unconventional setups, when thoughtfully implemented, can increase productivity, employee satisfaction, and innovation across industries.While many billionaires sign high-profile pledges without fully following through, Faulkner stands apart as a rare example of commitment and action. By giving away nearly all her wealth through philanthropy, cultivating a creative and educational workplace, and fostering employee engagement through unconventional office design and corporate rituals, she sets a benchmark for responsible, visionary leadership. Her approach demonstrates that a CEO can combine financial success, ethical responsibility, and innovation to create a lasting impact—not just on a company’s bottom line, but on the lives of employees, communities, and society at large. Faulkner’s legacy shows that generosity and innovation are not mutually exclusive but can reinforce each other. Her model inspires future leaders to pursue business success with purpose, creativity, and a commitment to societal well-being.","Ceo judy faulkner gives away nearly all her wealth through roots & wings.

Bill Gates reveals his winning answer to ‘why should we hire you’ to crack any interview,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-gates-reveals-his-winning-answer-to-why-should-we-hire-you-to-crack-any-interview/articleshow/123405257.cms,"

Bill Gates answers why should we hire you?

What are your strengths and weaknesses?





Where do you see yourself in five years?



What are your salary expectations?







Bill Gates’ final advice

When it comes to cracking a job interview, even the brightest candidates often stumble on the most common questions. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates , who has not only given interviews in his youth but also conducted countless ones as an employer, recently shared how to approach some of the trickiest questions that appear in almost every interview. Gates believes that while technical skills matter, the way candidates express their motivation, adaptability, and problem-solving abilities makes a lasting impression. His advice offers a mix of honesty, preparation, and strategic thinking that can help job seekers stand out in today’s highly competitive hiring environment.Gates emphasizes that this question isn’t about boasting but about clearly communicating your value in a way that resonates with the employer. He explains that hiring managers are not just looking for a list of accomplishments – they want to see how your skills and mindset directly align with the company’s mission and challenges. Instead of giving vague responses like “I work hard” or “I’m a team player,” Gates suggests tailoring your answer to highlight the exact strengths the employer is seeking. For example, if the role demands innovation, a candidate could describe a time when they creatively solved a difficult problem and how that approach could benefit the company.As an example, Gates himself often pointed to his coding achievements, deep passion for software, teamwork skills, and ambition when answering this question during his early career. By showcasing not only what he had already accomplished but also his enthusiasm and hunger to grow, he left interviewers convinced of his long-term potential. He advises modern candidates to take a similar approach: connect your unique skills directly to the company’s needs, show you are motivated to grow with the role, and position yourself as someone who can contribute to both short-term impact and long-term vision.According to Gates, this question is an opportunity for self-awareness rather than self-promotion. He recommends that candidates choose strengths that are relevant to the job while explaining how those qualities have produced real results in the past. On weaknesses, Gates suggests honesty balanced with growth – admitting areas of improvement while showing the steps you are taking to overcome them. This demonstrates maturity and a willingness to learn, qualities employers value highly.Bill Gates’ own answer: Gates admitted that he was not particularly skilled in marketing or sales, but he excelled in product creation and defining features. By acknowledging weaknesses without trying to disguise them, while doubling down on his true strengths, Gates showed the kind of critical self-awareness employers value.Gates points out that this question is less about predicting the future and more about revealing ambition. Employers want to see that candidates have direction and drive. He suggests aligning your career goals with the company’s growth, showing that you want to grow alongside the organization. Even if the long-term vision evolves, demonstrating that you think ahead and are motivated to build a future leaves a strong impression.On this tricky question, Gates advises candidates to strike a balance between confidence and flexibility. Being too rigid about salary can make you seem difficult to work with, while undervaluing yourself may raise doubts about your worth. Gates recommends doing prior research on industry standards and giving a reasonable range instead of a fixed number. He also stresses framing salary discussions in terms of value – how your skills and contributions justify the compensation – while showing openness to negotiation. This demonstrates professionalism and practicality, traits employers respect.For Gates, interviews are not just about answering questions but about telling a story – one that highlights your passion, your potential, and your fit with the company’s culture. He encourages candidates to prepare, practice, and remain authentic, reminding them that the goal is not perfection but connection. By framing common questions as opportunities to reveal character and ambition, Gates believes any candidate can turn a stressful interview into a powerful career breakthrough. Gates reminds candidates that confidence paired with curiosity often leaves a stronger impression than rehearsed answers. Embracing challenges and demonstrating adaptability can set you apart in any competitive interview. Gates believes that the candidates who succeed are those who combine skills with purpose, showing not just what they can do but why they want to do it.","Microsoft co-founder bill gates offers advice on how to answer the most common interview questions.
