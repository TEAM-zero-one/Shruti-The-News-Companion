Deepfake Shock: Nirmala Sitharaman Reveals Fake Videos Of Herself Online, Warns Of AI’s Dark Side

Armour up with TOI to fight deepening threat of deepfakes





In a world where seeing is no longer believing, India is facing a new digital menace: AI-generated deepfakes.These hyper-realistic videos and audio clips don’t just distort reality. They manipulate public perception, spread misinformation and undermine trust in democracy itself.With 85.5 per cent of Indian households owning at least one smartphone, mobile phones have become India’s bank, classroom and television, making citizens more vulnerable to digital deception.During the 2024 elections, for instance, satirical deepfakes became a campaign tool of sorts. Apart from resurrecting dead leaders, it featured clips such as one that featured PM Narendra Modi dancing the garba with women and Kamal Nath dissing a popular welfare scheme.Though investigations and arrests followed, such videos blur the line between fact and fiction, risking the distortion of voter opinion and the integrity of the democratic process.Cybersecurity experts warn AI is also becoming a key tool in cybercrime: 80 per cent phishing campaigns in 2024 involved AI, with deepfakes exploited for scams.“When you can fake images, audio, and video, how do you know if a real video is real? Suddenly, everything is in question,” said Hany Farid, professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in a TOI interview last year about the worrying rise in AI misuse.The deepfake threat extends beyond politics. Recently, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman highlighted the misuse of AI to clone voices and produce fake videos impersonating her, warning of potential financial scams and the erosion of public trust. “I have seen several deepfake videos of myself being circulated online, manipulated to mislead citizens and distort facts,” Sitharaman said in Mumbai. “Criminals are using AI to mimic voices, clone identities, and create lifelike videos,” she added.Given that over 97% of India’s urban youth aged 15 to 29 owns a smartphone, the impact of such misinformation on a generation is worrying, say observers. “Deepfakes began in 2016. Back then, it was a joke. But the technology has only gotten better. Earlier, there were photoshopped face swaps. Now there are lipsync fakes,” said Prof. Farid, warning that the tech has become more refined, raising the risk of harassment of women through the use of non-consensual sexual imagery.In Nov 2023, actress Rashmika Mandanna became a victim of a viral deepfake video that superimposed her face on to compromising content, sparking widespread outrage. “The very term ‘deepfake’ comes from a Reddit user who in the early days of this technology used it to create porn,” said Farid, calling the new term ‘Generative AI’ clever “rebranding” by the male-dominated tech industry.As AI evolves, India must strengthen legal frameworks, enhance digital literacy, and bring together minds across sectors to ensure safety, say experts. “We need to label everything as real or not real,” said Farid, “We need real disclosures.” To combat the deepening threat of deep fakes, TOI has already started armouring up. Watch out for our ‘Don’t Get Scammed’ stories to stay informed and aware. After all, as Farid puts it, “if you don’t know what’s real, how will you know what’s false”?","Ai-generated videos and audio clips don’t just distort reality.

NEW DELHI: In another major action against online gaming and betting companies, ED arrested WinZO founders Saumya Singh Rathore and Paavan Nanda late on Wednesday and produced them before a special court in Bengaluru, which remanded them to 10 days of ED custody. The agency has already frozen Rs 500 crore of assets of the company, including bonds, mutual funds and fixed deposits.According to ED sources, WinZO, which was operating from India despite a ban on all online money gaming and gambling activities, was siphoning off the proceeds of crime to the US and was in the process of shifting base to that country where online gaming is not banned. It was into online money gaming in Brazil, Germany and the US, besides India.""The directors of the company have systematically diluted their share in the Indian company, and these funds have been transferred to the US-based subsidiary. The total available balance in the foreign accounts of the company is around $55 mn (Rs 490 crore),"" agency sources said.During the hearing on the remand application on Thursday, the ED counsel told the court that ""using algorithms, the accused persons had deceived and defeated the players in different online games.Unaware that they were playing with an algorithm and that defeat was certain, the players were losing money"".""Prima facie, it was found during the investigation that Rs 177 crore of proceeds of crime was generated between May 2024 and August this year,"" the agency said. These illicit gains were then laundered to the US and Singapore through the subsidiaries of WinZo Games, US.According to ED, four FIRs were registered against the accused persons in Delhi, Bengaluru, Rajasthan and Gurgaon, and the agency later searched premises of the accused, including the offices of WinZo Games in Delhi and residence of Saumya Singh, between Nov 18 and Nov 22.The agency has also found a balance of Rs 43 crore in WinZo's escrow account, which remains classified as ""payable to users"" as of date.""The existence of such a significant pending payable amount is evidence that user wallets were blocked indiscriminately and arbitrarily, preventing legitimate users from accessing or withdrawing their own funds,"" sources said.","Ed arrests winzo founders saumya singh rathore and paavan nanda.

Explained: Why Vikram-I Could Transform India’s Satellite Launch Market And Global Space Leadership

HYDERABAD/NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Thursday virtually inaugurated Hyderabad-based spacetech startup Skyroot Aerospace’s Infinity campus and unveiled India’s first commercial orbital rocket, Vikram-I, which will launch satellites into low Earth orbit (LEO).Emphasising that India is on track to emerge as a global leader in the satellite launch ecosystem, Modi said, “The private sector is making giant strides in India's space sector. Skyroot's Infinity campus is a reflection of new thinking, innovation and most importantly, youth power. Our youth's innovation, risk-taking ability and entrepreneurship are touching new heights.”Extending his best wishes to Skyroot CEO Pawan Kumar Chandana and company co-founder Naga Bharath Daka, the PM said the two entrepreneurs are an inspiration for young people. “Growth of the private space sector, spearheaded by companies like Skyroot, is also a testament to the govt's efforts to foster innovation and private enterprise in the space domain,” he said.The Infinity facility, spread over 2 lakh sq ft in Hyderabad, will have the capability to design, develop, integrate and test multiple launch vehicles, with a capacity to build one orbital rocket every month. It adds to Skyroot's 55,000-sq-ft integrated rocket design and development facility — Max-Q — near Hyderabad airport.Pointing out that though India’s space journey began with limited resources, its ambitions were never limited, Modi said: “India has proven that the height of dreams is determined not by resources but by resolve. Today, India possesses space sector capabilities that only a few countries in the world have.”He also praised Isro, saying it “has for decades given new wings to India’s space journey.” Modi also recalled the reforms undertaken in the space sector, with his govt opening up the sector to private innovation and preparing a new Space Policy.Modi highlighted that more than 300 space startups are today powering India’s space aspirations, with most of them starting out with small teams. “Gen-Z engineers, designers, coders and scientists are creating new technologies, whether in propulsion systems, composite materials, rocket stages or satellite platforms.”Space promoter and regulator IN-SPACe chairman Dr Pawan Goenka said that in just five years since the space sector was opened up, over 350 space startups have emerged. “The Infinity campus and Vikram-1 are testaments to what can be achieved when entrepreneurial ambition meets enabling policy. We are building more than rockets. We are building a competitive space economy,” he said.Skyroot co-founder Pawan Chandana said the company was ready to launch Vikram-1, fully designed and built in India, in the next two months. Pointing out that decisive space reforms had unlocked the skies for startups to fly, co-founder Naga Bharath Daka said Skyroot has already generated over 1,000 hi-tech jobs and will be investing around Rs 1,000 crore soon to become one of the few companies worldwide to achieve rapid and on-demand launch capabilities.Set up in 2018 by the two IIT alumni and former Isro scientists, Skyroot became the first Indian company to successfully build and launch a rocket into space with suborbital rocket Vikram-S.","Pm narendra modi virtually inaugurated hyderabad-based spacetech startup skyroot aerospace’s infinity campus.

“Smear campaign against her”: Blake Lively refuses to engage with Taylor Swift as Travis Kelce ignores the drama,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/smear-campaign-against-her-blake-lively-refuses-to-engage-with-taylor-swift-as-travis-kelce-ignores-the-drama/articleshow/125587627.cms,"Hollywood's once-tight Blake Lively-Taylor Swift friendship appears strained, with Lively's recent social media silence fueling speculation. This distance is reportedly linked to Lively's legal battle with co-star Justin Baldoni, which inadvertently involved Swift. Insiders suggest Swift is working to rebuild trust, indicating a complex, human dynamic behind the public perception of a feud.

Blake Lively’s ICY SILENCE Sparks Feud Talk After Taylor Swift’s Engagement Reveal Goes Unanswered

Blake Lively’s latest move suggests the Taylor Swift friendship isn’t healing anytime soon

For years, Blake Lively and Taylor Swift were one of Hollywood’s most beloved celebrity friendships; playful, outspoken supporters of each other, and famously intertwined in each other’s public lives. That’s why fans reacted with genuine excitement on October 3, 2025, when Blake finally liked Taylor’s Instagram post about her album ""The Life of a Show Girl"".It broke a long stretch of silence and made people hope the icy distance between them had finally begun to thaw. But just when fans thought the two were back on a path toward normalcy, Blake once again became notably absent from Taylor’s social media orbit, especially after Swift posted the trailer for her docuseries The End of an Era. Suddenly, the reconciliation narrative started feeling premature.The distance between them is intertwined with Blake Lively’s legal battle against Justin Baldoni, her It Ends With Us co-star. In her lawsuit, Lively accused Baldoni of sexual harassment and “waging a smear campaign against her.” When Baldoni countersued, things escalated and Taylor Swift got pulled into the firestorm.Baldoni’s legal team claimed Lively had allegedly used her friendship with Swift as leverage during production, and even moved to subpoena the singer before ultimately withdrawing the request.Being dragged into a legal drama of that nature, unexpectedly and against her will, inevitably strained trust.Reports from PEOPLE added context in June, noting that “Swift and Lively aren’t as close and haven’t been spending as much time together as they did in the past.” Another insider emphasized the emotional distance: “Taylor is working to trust Blake again but it’s going to take some time.”From the outside, the silence looks like avoidance. From the inside, it may be caution, especially with Swift recently engaged to Travis Kelce and aware that every association of hers instantly becomes a headline.Today, Blake’s quiet non-engagement with Taylor’s latest post doesn’t just speak to social media patterns; it hints at unresolved tension and emotional processing behind the scenes. The reality is less dramatic than “feud”, and more human: two friends navigating trust, hurt, and public scrutiny in real time, with the world watching closely and guessing loudly.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s Disney+ docuseries faces unexpected legal threat from Florida courtroom as Travis Kelce remains silent","Hollywood's once-tight blake lively-taylor swift friendship appears strained.

Fringe sport CEO PK confirms Kyle Divine’s arrest and ends partnership





Kyle Divine, the man known for his “Kaizen DIY Gym” videos online, was arrested on November 26 after very serious claims were made against him. These claims came from a now-viral post on his Instagram handle @kaizendiygym, where someone shared a screen recording of a chat with Rainn, a national hotline for people facing sexual violence.The message in the chat said that Kyle Divine’s 16-year-old stepdaughter told the hotline that he had hurt her many times and had given her drugs. A pinned comment on the post said it was written by his wife, and she said she found the chat on her daughter’s phone.Soon, people began to ask if Kyle Divine was really arrested. This question was answered when an inmate record for Brian Kyle Divine appeared on the official Indianapolis and Marion County government website, confirming that he had been taken into custody.After the Instagram post went viral, more people began sharing updates online. A user named John Dorsey (@goob_u2) posted what looked like an inmate record.This record matched the details on the official Marion County website, which showed that Kyle Divine had been booked for two charges, a class A misdemeanor for contributing to the delinquency of a minor, and a level 6 felony for “Child Seduction – Guardian/Adoptive/Step-Parent Fondle/Touch – Child 16–17.”As the case spread online, Fringe Sport CEO PK posted a Facebook video confirming that he had seen the official arrest report. He said that Fringe Sport would now end all work with Kyle Divine, even though Kyle helped create the company’s Mammoth Belt Squat product.PK also asked people to stay respectful toward the victims and not create more harm through online fights or angry posts.Kyle Divine is now being held at the Marion County Adult Processing Center (APC). He is set to appear in court on December 2, 2025. Kyle has more than 113,000 followers on Instagram and nearly 50,000 followers on TikTok, and the news has left his online audience shocked and confused as more details continue to unfold.Also Read: Who Was Marquay Collins?

Who is Clavicular? Inside the controversial looksmaxxing streamer behind the Kick injection scandal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/who-is-clavicular-inside-the-controversial-looksmaxxing-streamer-behind-the-kick-injection-scandal/articleshow/125623957.cms,"Image Via ""X""

“heartbreaking,” “evil,”

“deeply disturbing.”

Inside the rise of Clavicular and the controversy surrounding his Kick injection incident

“hardmaxxing”

“recessed mandibles,”

“self-improvement”





Clavicular, real name Braden Peters, has become one of the most polarizing figures in the growing looksmaxxing space, a subculture fixated on appearance enhancement that ranges from harmless grooming tips to extreme, medically questionable practices. Over the past year, the 20-year-old influencer has built a devoted but highly divided following across TikTok, Kick, and other platforms by dissecting facial structures, rating people’s attractiveness using pseudo-scientific language, and promoting aggressive self-improvement routines. But his latest on-stream stunt, injecting his 17-year-old girlfriend with cosmetic peptides, has pushed him into a different level of controversy entirely.The incident, which unfolded during a Kick stream, has drawn widespread condemnation, with viewers accusing him of exploiting a minor, glamorizing dangerous procedures, and potentially engaging in the unlicensed practice of medicine. The backlash was immediate, with dozens of viral posts calling the situationandFor critics, the stream confirmed what many feared: that the looksmaxxing world has quickly evolved from edgy self-help to reckless, real-world experimentation, and influencers like Clavicular are at the center of that shift.To understand why Clavicular resonates with a young male audience, one has to understand the roots of looksmaxxing itself. Emerging from incel forums in the 2010s, the movement promotes maximizing one’s physical appeal, sometimes through routine habits like skincare and fitness, but often through extreme methods such as limb-lengthening, steroid use, andtactics. Clavicular capitalized on this culture after claiming to undergo a dramatic glow-up, attributing his transformation to strict looksmaxxing practices. His content largely revolves around critiquing facial symmetry, jawlines, andoften rating celebrities harshly, including giving Michael B. Jordan a 3.5/10.Clavicular quickly aligned himself with other manosphere creators like Andrew Tate, Ed Matthews, and HStikkytokky, adopting a blend of hyper-critical beauty commentary and traditionalist gender expectations. This posture carried into his relationship, where he has publicly pressured his girlfriend to drop out of college, while simultaneously subjecting her appearance to his looksmaxxing standards. But injecting a minor on stream has crossed a legal and ethical line that even his usual critics didn’t foresee, sparking debates about exploitation, consent, and the dangers of online influence.As the backlash continues, Clavicular’s case has become a flashpoint in the broader conversation about the risks of unregulatedsubcultures online. Whether this marks a turning point for the looksmaxxing movement or simply the latest scandal in an increasingly extreme digital landscape remains to be seen, but for now, the spotlight on Clavicular shows no signs of dimming.Also Read: Hasan Pikar calls out Asmongold for ‘Hasan is finished’ video over China trip clips","Clavicular, real name braden peters, has become one of the most polarizing figures in the growing looksmaxxing space.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff has declared that he will not use ChatGPT, the AI chatbot developed by Microsoft-backed AI company OpenAI . His comments came after he used Google’s latest AI model, Gemini 3.0, stating that a two-hour experience with Google’s new model has convinced him to switch permanently. Google CEO Sundar Pichai termed the Gemini 3 as the company’s “most intelligent model, that combines all of Gemini’s capabilities together so you can bring any idea to life. ”In a post on X, Benioff claimed that Gemini 3.0 has brought a monumental shift in the AI landscape. The CEO specifically praised Gemini 3’s performance across multiple modalities, noting key improvements in reasoning, speed, image quality, and video processing as the compelling factors behind his decision.“Holy shit. I’ve used ChatGPT every day for 3 years. Just spent 2 hours on Gemini 3. I’m not going back. The leap is insane — reasoning, speed, images, video… everything is sharper and faster. It feels like the world just changed, again. ❤️ 🤖”Benioff’s endorsement highlights the competitive pressure now facing OpenAI as models from rival tech giants like Google make significant advances. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and even OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman praised Pichai following the launch of Gemini 3.The xAI founder said “Congrats” on Pichai’s ""Geminiii"" announcement on X, and “Nice Work” to Demis Hassabis, the chief of DeepMind. Altman posted “Congrats to Google on Gemini 3! Looks like a great model.”Altman even noted potential “temporary economic headwinds” in an internal memo but expressed confidence in OpenAl’s rapid progress and leadership in the Al race.“We have built enough strength as a company to weather great models shipping elsewhere competition... (so), having most of our research team focused on really getting to superintelligence is critically important,” Altman wrote in the internal memo.Stripe CEO Patrick Collison also posted on X that Gemini 3 built him an “interactive web page summarising 10 breakthroughs in genetics,” and called it “pretty cool.” Nvidia also replied to Google stock rally, priasing Google's growth.","Salesforce ceo mark benioff has declared that he will not use chatgpt, the ai chatbot developed by microsoft-backed ai company openai.

What Is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

Disruption will come from the unexpected





Take lessons from the dot-com era









Billionaire investor and Shark Tank judge Mark Cuban has now issued a warning to leading artificial intelligence companies including Perplexity, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft and Meta. Cuban has argued that all these companies are overspending in the race to build the world’s most powerful AI model. As reported by Business Insider, speaking in the Pioneers of AI podcast, Cuban compared today’s AI arms race to the search engine boom of 1990s. The search engine boom ultimately ended with Google dominating the market and leaving all the rivals behind.“You’ve got five, six, whatever it is, companies that are trying to create the ultimate foundational model that we all depend on,” Cuban said. “It’s almost like in the ’90s when all the search engines were competing pre-Google… Now, we know with search engines it’s Google, and then there’s Bing, as, like, 1 or 2% and DuckDuckGo has got a half a percent. So it’s effectively a winner-take-all.”Like many other world leaders and analysts Cuban has also cautioned that the massive investments done on AI could ultimately lead to the creation of a bubble. “They may be overspending,” he said.“And if they overspend or get too caught up, the bubble is in the competition between all those models because that could pop just like that with any new technology.”Along with this, he also raised concerns about the infrastructure costs behind AI, majorly the massive and expensive data centers which are being built to power large models. “I just can’t imagine over a 10-year period that we aren’t going to improve the technology enough that if you overspend on today’s technology, it just doesn’t feel right to me,” Cuban added.Cuban also emphasised that the disruption AI will not come from incremental improvements but from something “incredible” that no one sees coming. “Somebody’s going to come up with some incredible shit, right? If I knew what it was, I’d do it,” he said, suggesting that the current race may be blindsided by a breakthrough outside the existing competition.Cuban said he recognizes the same mix of hype, excitement, and overspending now playing out in AI. “They anticipate for at least another decade spending every penny they have,” he said of the major model developers. “I mean, if that’s not ripe for disruption to come up with better ways, I don’t know what is.”","Billionaire investor and shark tank judge mark cuban has issued a warning to leading artificial intelligence companies including perplexity, openai, anthropic, google, microsoft and meta.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has revealed his annual holiday reading list as the 2025 comes to a close. Gates has recommended five books and he believes that all these titles spark curiosity and reflection during the quieter days of the winter season. “Each of these books pulls back the curtain on how something important really works: how people find purpose later in life, how we should think about climate change, how creative industries evolve, how humans communicate,” wrote Gates.In the blog post, Gates has also explained that holidays are the perfect tome to slow down and also catch up on reading. “There’s something about the quieter days around the holidays that makes it easier to sit down with a good book,” he wrote. His list on 2025 book recommendations reflects on his fascination with how the world works and how you can start a great conversation.The book belongs to the fiction genre and its a story of an aging janitor and a wise octopus captive hime with its empathy and storytelling. “Van Pelt's story made me think about the challenge of filling the days after you stop working—and what communities can do to help older people find purpose,” said Gates.The books explains about the climate challenges. The book structures 50 big questions on climate change, nuclear power and renewables. “ I’ve followed Hannah’s work at Our World in Data for years, and her new book is one of the clearest explanations of the climate challenge I’ve read. She’s realistic about the risks but grounded in data that shows real progress,” said Gates.It is a memoir which recounts the Diller’s extraordinary career in Hollywood, media, and technology, blending personal anecdotes with reflections on power, risk-taking, and the evolution of entertainment and digital industries. “He’s spent his life betting on ideas before they were obvious, and the industries he’s transformed show how much those bets can pay off,” said Gates.The book explains about the mysteries of human behaviour and how people communicate. “Although the topic itself is pretty complicated, the book is readable and practical, and it made me see everyday social interactions in a new light,” added Gate.The books offers a glimpse of at why America seems to struggle to build things and what it will take to fix that. The book argues that progress depends not just on good ideas but on the systems that help ideas spread.",Microsoft co-founder bill gates has revealed his annual holiday reading list as the 2025 comes to a close.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai on AI layoffs









Google recently launched its most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3.0. Announcing the launch of Gemini 3.0, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that it is ‘the best model in the world for multimodal understanding’. Now weeks after the intense work on Gemini 3.0, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has acknowledged that his engineers are overdue for a break. As reported by Business Insider, speaking on the Google AI” Release Notes podcast, Pichai said “I think some folks need some sleep,” adding that hopefully he and his teams “get a bit of rest” now that the milestone launch is behind them.The comment made by Pichai comes as Google is moving towards a $4 trillion market cap as the stock price of the company has surged by nearly 70% this year, including a 12% jump following Gemini 3’s debut on November 18. The Gemini 3.0 model has been widely praised for its reasoning, speed and multimodal capabilities. Recently, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff also described the Gemini 3.0 model as an ‘insane’ leap forward. He also added that after using Gemini 3.0 for two hours he will not go back to ChatGPT.After the successful roll out of Gemini 3.0, Google has managed to reclaim its frontrunner position in the AI race. Pichai noted that years of hard work of the company is the sole reason behind this success.“In 2016, I wanted the whole company to be AI-first,” he said, pointing to milestones such as the creation of Google Brain in 2012, the acquisition of DeepMind in 2014, AlphaGo’s victory in Go, and the unveiling of Google’s own tensor processing units (TPUs), which were used to train Gemini.Pichai further talked about the Google’s strategy. Pichai explained that Google always worked towards a “full-stack” approach to innovation, improving everything from infrastructure to model training and test-time compute. He admitted that when generative AI first gained traction, Google was short on capacity and had to invest heavily to scale. “If you were on the outside, it would look like we were quiet, or we were behind, but we were putting all the building blocks in place, and then executing on top of it,” he said.Recently, Google CEO Sundar Pichai talked about AI layoffs. In a recent expansive interview with BBC, Sundar Pichai pushed back against concerns that AI could eventually lead to mass job cuts. Pichai said that the tech will eliminate some jobs but also “evolve and transition” others -- ramifications that mean ""people will need to adapt.""Pichai further added that AI may be gunning for his job, but he doesn’t seem too worried about it. AI is advancing so swiftly, he said, that over the next 12 months the tech will be able to perform “complex” tasks and act as an agent on a users' behalf. ""That’s where it gets really interesting,"" he said.",Google recently launched its most-advanced ai model — gemini 3.0.

“We have built enough strength as a company to weather great models shipping elsewhere competition... (so), having most of our research team focused on really getting to superintelligence is critically important,”

“It s**ks that we have to do so many hard things at the same time — the best research lab, the best AI infrastructure company, and the best AI platform/product company — but such is our lot in life. And I wouldn't trade positions with any other company,”

“This partnership is a step toward ensuring the core technologies of the AI era are built here [US],” and added that AI infrastructure production presents a

ChatGPT maker OpenAI 's CEO Sam Altman is optimistic about Google 's recent successes in artificial intelligence (AI) technology. In a recent internal memo to colleagues, Altman acknowledged that the AI startup rival's success couldHowever, Altman reassured that OpenAI isand anticipates emerging as the leader in the AI race. It's important to note that Altman's memo was written before Google's Gemini 3 was released, a model the tech giant has described as its most capable to date. Software developers have reported that the new model performed well on tasks such as automating website and product design and writing code, which is a lucrative revenue stream for OpenAI and its competitors, such as Anthropic.Concerns about OpenAI's slowing growth arose late this summer. During a recent quarterly earnings call with investors, the company’s CFO, Sarah Friar, confirmed that user engagement with the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT had cooled, despite the company's otherwise positive financial results.According to a report by The Information (as seen by The Economic Times), Sam Altman's memo noted that competitors such as Google and Anthropic are narrowing the gap in the AI raceAnthropic’s Claude model generates computer code for various tasks using conversational prompts.Meanwhile, Google has been integrating its Gemini AI chatbot into its search app, productivity tools and other services. However, recently, Claude gained a new challenger from OpenAI with the introduction of Codex.Google also holds an economic advantage. OpenAI’s growth has been rapid and the company now carries a valuation of around $500 billion as a for-profit entity. It is expected to bring in about $13 billion in revenue, but is estimated to burn roughly $100 billion in its push toward superintelligence.With a market value of about $3.5 trillion, Google reported free cash flow of over $70 billion in the past four quarters. A significant portion of this comes from providing cloud services to OpenAI, Anthropic and other competitors.Sam Altman also encouraged OpenAI employees to stay confident and focus on the company's larger goals.Altman wrote in the internal memo.Altman added.Recently, OpenAI partnered with Apple's biggest suuplier Foxconn to design and build AI data-centre components in the US. Under this partnership, OpenAI will help develop future server systems and may purchase Foxconn-produced hardware in the coming days. Altman noted that this collaboration can strengthen American manufacturing infrastructure.Commenting on the partnership, Altman said:Foxconn will join OpenAI’s supply chain to manufacture AI-related hardware in a more American way. The company, known for iPhone assembly, also manufactures AI servers and supplies components to Nvidia.Commenting on the partnership, Foxconn chairman Young Liu said that the companyIn September, Oracle also inked a $300 billion deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Since then, the company has shed more than $300 billion in market value, and Wall Street is starting to wonder if a partnership between the companies will bring returns or pose risks for Oracle.","Openai ceo sam altman acknowledges google's ai advancements, noting potential temporary economic challenges but expressing confidence in openai's rapid progress.
