Donatella Versace has taken her last runway bow. Versace, the younger sister of the founder Gianni Versace and the woman who stepped in to safeguard the company after his murder in 1997, is leaving her post as chief creative officer after nearly 30 years.She will be chief brand ambassador, an honorary role involving philanthropy and red carpets (and red carpet philanthropy). Dario Vitale , the former design and image director of Miu Miu , has been named the new $2.1 billion for the brand, which includes homewares and hotel design. Still, Versace never fit comfortably into the American group, and sales have declined.Now it will be up to Vitale to continue that legacy, following his two years as design director at Miu Miu, one of fashion’s most astonishing success stories. Miu Miu revenue grew by 97.3% in 2024, a year when much of the industry saw sales fall thanks to consumer uncertainty and a broader industry slowdown. Vitale called the job at Versace a “privilege” and thanked Versace for “her trust”.NYT established became part of her signature, and for the Grammys in 2000, she put Jennifer Lopez in a “jungle dress” cut to her navel. There were so many search queries for the look that Google Images was born. Celebrities and supermodels loved her. She became among the most recognisable designers in the world, played onscreen by Lady Gaga, Penelope Cruz, Gina Gershon and Maya Rudolph. She was so easy to caricature that she often wasn’t given enough credit for Versace’s success.But in 2018 Capri (then called Michael Kors) paid ion. Despite having no formal fashion training, she grew into a beloved figure within the company and the industry. “It has been the greatest honour of my life to carry on my brother Gianni’s legacy,” Versace said in the news release.“He was the true genius, but I hope I have some of his spirit and tenacity.” The rare woman at the top of a major fashion brand, she wore her struggles — with personal tragedy, self-doubt, finding her creative feet, and drugs — with as much aplomb as her long platinum hair.The joyfully brash aesthetic Versace was never supposed to be its designer. She assumed that role after her brother was shot on the steps of his Miami mansdesigner. In a release on Thursday, John Idol, the CEO of Capri Holdings , which owns Versace as well as Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo, called the decision “part of a thoughtful succession plan”.The change comes as Capri is considering the sale of Versace after Federal Trade Commission blocked an attempted merger with Tapestry, the owner of Coach and Kate Spade. Prada currently has an exclusive bidding window on the brand, according to a source.

The Wendy Williams Show

Wendy Williams' brother, Tommy Williams, is calling for her release from the New York City assisted living facility, asserting that, “She is in great shape.” His plea follows her recent hospitalisation after police conducted a wellness check, as she continues to contest her court-ordered guardianship.The New York Post exclusively obtained a photo of Wendy Williams, showing her smiling near the window of her fifth-floor room on Thursday, dressed in a Versace bathrobe.Earlier, her brother Tommy Williams told Us Weekly on Wednesday that, ""She is in great shape mentally and physically.”“Let her out,” he added.Earlier this week, she was transported to hospital by ambulance after dropping a note reading ""Help! Wendy!"" whilst waving frantically from her window on Monday.""Help! Wendy!!"" stated the note. Subsequently, she was photographed being taken to Lenox Hill Hospital.The medical assessment confirmed her mental faculties were sound, after she completed a ""capacity test"" psychological evaluation, scoring perfectly by correctly answering all 10 questions designed to assess alertness and orientation at the hospital, according to TMZ.According to the New York Post, her brother considers this achievement significant. ""Now she has some direction and understanding of her functional abilities and cognizant abilities,"" Tommy told Us Weekly.""It’s a win for Wendy, a big one. And she did it herself. It also shows she is fluid with her thoughts and actions. It’s a wait and see. We want to root Wendy on. We watch and listen and cheer her on.

""She is letting the public know it is unfair, it is unjust,"" Monterrosa said.""She doesn’t need to be in a guardianship. She is not incapacitated. She will continue to voice her opinion,"" she added.Tommy and Monterrosa have disclosed that Williams cannot possess a mobile phone at the facility and is restricted to making outgoing calls via landline.""We’d love for her to be in an unrestrictive environment — even at another facility — where she has freedom to come in and out, see her friends, people can call her, she can have an iPad, she can use a two-way phone — not just [a] one way [phone],"" Monterrosa further added.Wendy Williams, 60, has been living in a Manhattan assisted living facility under court-ordered guardianship following her diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia, a degenerative disease that affects memory.Her hit talk show,, premiered in 2008 and ran until 2022 when it was canceled due to her ongoing physical and mental health struggles.In an interview last month, Williams revealed she resides on a floor known as the ""memory unit,"" designed for individuals with severe memory loss.

With Love, Meghan

The Duchess of Sussex , in the second episode of her new Netflix cookery show, shares how her passion for jam-making stems from childhood memories of her grandmother making apple butter. However, her estranged father, 80-year-old Thomas Markle Sr , has criticised the series, claiming Meghan has ""never been authentic"" and that ""she's faking it for the cameras.""He said that whilst his mother Doris, who passed away in 2011, deeply cared for Meghan, she would be distressed by her granddaughter's recent statements. ""I haven't seen the show but I've seen a ton of clips and I've read many stories. I might sit down and watch it one day but I'm not sure,"" Meghan’s father, Thomas Markle Sr told The Daily Mail on Sunday.During the show, viewers noticed an interaction between Meghan and Mindy Kaling , where Meghan interrupts her friend for using ' Meghan Markle ', stating: ""It's so funny you keep saying 'Meghan Markle', you know I'm 'Sussex' now.""Thomas responded: ""My mum loved Meghan very much but she would be so disappointed to hear that Meghan no longer wants to use the name ""Markle."" He further remarked sarcastically: ""Now I have to say, I am Meghan Sussex's dad.""Thomas, a seasoned Hollywood professional who has worked on shows like Married… with Children and General Hospital, shared insights from his industry experience, stating that: ""Cooking shows are horrendously boring unless the presenter has a passion for it.""""You have to be authentic to hold people’s attention. When you are stuffing the turkey’s ass it has to look like you’re having fun doing it. Unfortunately Meghan has never been authentic. She has to think about everything. She's not spontaneous. Everything she says is pre-planned and rehearsed. It makes me laugh because I know all her looks and expressions,"" the retired TV lighting director, said.He continued: ""I know when she's faking it for the cameras. She's trying so hard to be perfect that she tenses up every time the camera is on her.""""The best cooks are funny, they mess up, they are human. She just wants to be perfect. It’s sad because she’s trying so hard to stay in the limelight,"" he added.In the Netflix series, Meghan portrayed herself as a ""latchkey kid"" and discussed her supposedly modest upbringing, claiming regular consumption of fast food and TV dinners stating that: ""I grew up with a lot of fast food and also a lot of TV tray dinners. It feels like such a different time but that was so normal with the microwavable kids meals.'Thomas countered this narrative, explaining, ""We occasionally ate TV dinners, which family doesn’t?’ But I was working two jobs so money was never an issue. We would eat out at least three times a week and order in the rest of the time.""Contrary to claims of a fast-food upbringing, Meghan regularly visited Musso & Frank, an upscale Hollywood establishment operating since 1919, which was her preferred dining spot.Thomas elaborated: ""Like any single father who did a long day's work, I'd occasionally put a TV dinner in the microwave. But most of the time we'd go out. After school I would either pick her up myself and we'd go out to eat or I'd send a car to bring her to the set. She grew up on the sets I worked on. She was never a latchkey kid.""He noted that whilst his former spouse excelled at cooking, Meghan showed limited interest in culinary pursuits during her childhood. He considers her current show disconnected from everyday reality.""Meghan should make affordable food and show people how to stretch their food budget,"" he suggested further adding that, ""The women who watch Meghan's show are not all rich and privileged. I think people would love it if she focused on more economical dishes.""These statements follow recent criticism from Thomas Markle Jr, who disputed Meghan's childhood accounts in her Netflix programme.""That's just another one of the malarkey stories she sold to the royal family for sympathy,"" Thomas Jr. told TalkTV, having not communicated with the duchess for over ten years.""We weren't poor. She didn't have to rub two nickels together at Sizzler's salad bar. The entire world knows how she treated her family, especially her father, who gave her everything. That’s why nobody’s buying it,"" he added.Last week, it was revealed that the second season ofhas already been filmed and is set to premiere on Netflix this summer. The series is part of the Sussexes' five-year, $100 million deal with the streaming giant, which is set to expire in October. However, many in Hollywood speculate that Netflix may opt not to renew the agreement.","Thomas markle sr, 80, has criticised the series, claiming meghan has ""never been authentic"" he said that whilst his mother doris, who passed away in 2011, deeply cared for meghan, she would be distressed by her granddaughter's recent statements.

TikTok will be blocked in Albania for one year, starting Thursday. The Chinese-owned social media app has roughly 1.5 million users in the Balkan nation.According to local media, the Albanian Authority for Electronic and Postal Communications has ordered all internet service providers to block access to the app's servers and provide written proof.The ban was first announced in December by Prime Minister Edi Rama. The decision came after an escalation between teenagers on the platform resulted in a brawl that left a 14-year-old dead and another seriously injured.The killing triggered discussions on the impact of social media on Albania's youth, with Rama himself calling the app a ""neighborhood thug.""But opposition parties have argued against the ban, saying that they rely on the app for campaigning. The next parliamentary elections will be held in May, bringing the timing of the ban into question.Albania will be the first European nation to block the app entirely. But other countries may soon follow suit.Romanian authorities have called for the app to be suspended amid the ongoing chaos of their recently voided election. Experts credit the app for assisting a far-right candidate's shock win in last year's vote, before the result was annulled by a court.Other countries have already taken further steps.In 2020, India banned TikTok citing national security concerns.Last year, Australia banned access to all social media, including TikTok, for children under 16 years old.France, meanwhile, temporarily banned the app in New Caledonia, one of its remaining overseas colonies.",Chinese-owned app has roughly 1.5 million users in albania.

Could Europe benefit from Trump's 'assault on science'?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/could-europe-benefit-from-trumps-assault-on-science/articleshow/118976513.cms,"What is Trump's 'assault on science'?

Bad for the US, good for Europe?

Will displaced US scientists find a home in Europe?

European funders aim to attract top research talent

Stand Up for Science protests

show global solidarity

Barely six weeks after taking office for a second term, the Trump administration's cost-cutting in science and technology may result in a positive outcome for research in Europe. The journal Nature has called the moves an ""assault on science"" in the US — but they may have worldwide ramifications.President Donald Trump and his team have laid off thousands of employees at US science agencies: These include senior positions at NASA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which is considered one of the world's most important sites for climate and weather research.The job cuts have involved work on nuclear safety, disease surveillance — including that of measles and avian flu, both currently circulating in the US — extreme-weather forecasting and climate research.Even among those scientists who have retained their jobs, some are questioning whether they still have a future at American agencies and research institutes.They say they face further funding and hiring freezes, restrictions on data transfer, and censorship around climate change, gender studies and vaccine hesitancy.""We can suddenly recruit talent that we would not have been able to attract under normal circumstances,"" said Patrick Cramer, President of the Max Planck Society in Germany.The prospect of a US science brain drain is seen as ""a great opportunity for Europe as a research location,"" said Cramer.Applications from US scientists to the group of 84 Max Planck Institutes have at least doubled and, in some cases, tripled.""But for research as a whole, it is a clear step backwards, something that worries me greatly,"" he said.""It's important to stand ready to take in outstanding researchers who have to or want to leave the US,"" said Christina Beck, head of communications at the Max Planck Society in Munich.Beck told DW that universities and research centers around Germany were ""expecting a lot more applications from the US.""Some European research institutes were looking to attract US-based researchers by making it easier for them to relocate and continue their work here.France's Aix-Marseille University (AMU) announced on March 5 that it was setting up a program dedicated to attracting scientists whose research faces possible censorship in the US.The university said it aimed to welcome researchers into ""an environment conducive to innovation, excellence and academic freedom.""Major European science innovation and funding agencies are also considering measures to attract US-based scientists.Michiel Scheffer at the European Innovation Council (EIC) wrote on social media that ""a concept"" to welcome scientists from the US would be discussed at an EIC board meeting in April.The European Commission, which funds major European research projects, including a €95 billion ($103 billion) program called Horizon Europe, is considering the creation of ""a special passport"" for scientists — an EU visa policy to attract talented researchers.The policy, which the Commission plans to present later this year, would aim to attract US-based researchers, and researchers elsewhere, who feel their work may be hindered by current trends in the US.However, it's not just European research centers looking to attract US-based researchers. On March 5, the Chinese government said it would expand its efforts to attract researchers affected by Trump's funding cuts.South Korea is also formulating a response, with the government planning to revise visa policies for foreign scientists to make it easier for them to work in the country.Some European science funders warn against exploiting the challenges US-based scientists face.""We should avoid saying 'God, they are having a bad time over there, now let's go and snatch them all back,'"" said Maria Leptin, president of the European Research Council, at the European Parliament in February.But many others feel that Trump's science policies will affect science globally and say that that is what they are fighting against. As some expressed in that article in Nature, scientific research is an inherently international, collaborative effort. And there are indications that some of the cuts to US research have already affected projects in other countries.On March 7, thousands of researchers and science supporters protested in cities across the US against the Trump administration's policies. These ""Stand Up for Science"" protests mobilized across Europe, as well, including at nearly 40 university cities in France. They were inspired by the March for Science movement, inaugurated during President Trump's first term in office between 2017-2021.","President donald trump and his team have laid off thousands of employees at us science agencies.

Cash flows in top 5 IT firms

BENGALURU: Indian IT firms generated around $20 billion in free cash flows last year, and more than 75% was returned to shareholders. Industry experts believe Indian IT firms are in for a big reset, especially with AI disrupting the linear relationship between revenue and employment.The Indian IT sector is reeling under a single-digit growth cycle. Its mainstay financial services business is under pressure, and lower discretionary spending provides a limited runway for growth. Besides, Indian developers are bracing for challenges from AI advancements, particularly as basic & intermediate-level coding tasks become increasingly automated.The top five Indian IT firms had free cash flows of nearly $13 billion in the 2023-24 financial year. In a recent LinkedIn post, Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, who serves as a partner at Catalincs, a technology growth advisory firm, raised an intriguing question: Can Indian IT deploy a part of its free cash flow as “risk capital”? Can it help prevent “techolonization”?“A commonly heard argument is that the IT services sector, given its asset-light model, does not require significant investment. When growth is suboptimal, the priority is often to return cash to shareholders. While this reasoning holds, the landscape is changing. With hundreds of billions of dollars locked into opportunities created by multiple structural shifts in technology and business, isn’t now an opportune moment for companies to capitalize on these shifts by reinvesting in the business and leaping into the future instead of playing by yesterday’s rules?” Ramamoorthy wrote.Namratha Dharshan, chief business leader at ISG, said the industry is at an inflection point.” Many of the IT majors recognise that the traditional business models amidst a fast-changing technology landscape will not be sufficient to address the needs that will arise in the future. IT services companies must strike a delicate balance between fostering innovation and meeting shareholder expectations for predictable returns .”Phil Fersht, CEO of HfS Research, said smart Indian IT firms must focus more on reinvesting their cash into broadening their global capabilities , especially considering the recent changes with the US administration and the current state of global trade and geopolitics. “If they just focus on pleasing their shareholders’ short-term needs, they will struggle long-term if they expect the same old traditional business to keep growing at 10% a year.”Fersht said there is an increasing concern from US industry leaders that all their exports of work outside the US will come under the spotlight as new tariff programmes get rolled out. “The impact would result in big hikes in costs, which could be as high as the 25% level, considering the current tariffs that are being set. Why stop at Mexico, Canada, China, and the EU?”Ramamoorthy pointed out potential avenues to explore strategic investments leveraging cash flows for growth. “There are abundant opportunities for the industry and for well-run companies with predictable cash flows. Could they use their substantial cash flows as ""risk capital"" (akin to what Alibaba or Tencent did) to take minority stakes in promising next-gen companies that are into products, platforms, deep tech, and more? Second, could a consortium of these cash-rich companies invest in building India’s much-needed compute, AI, cloud, and cyber infrastructure and benefit from it, rather than leaving this critical task largely to the govt?”","The indian it sector is reeling under a single-digit growth cycle.

MUMBAI: Value Attics Reinsurance has received a reinsurance licence from insurance regulator Irdai, making it the first private-sector reinsurer . This ends the five-decade monopoly of the public-sector reinsurer GIC Re . The approval was granted at Irdai’s board meeting, the last meet under chairman Debasish Panda, whose term ends this week. Govt has invited applications for the post.Value Attics is backed by Canadian investor Prem Watsa ’s Fairfax group and Kamlesh Goyal. Watsa, who has already floated Go Digit General and Life Insurance with Goyal, is expanding his presence in India's insurance sector. However, the reinsurance firm will not be linked to the direct insurance business.The company will begin operations with a paid-up capital of Rs 200 crore, bringing expertise from Watsa’s global reinsurance businesses, while leveraging its balance sheet to underwrite large risks. Future investments are expected to be much higher, given that promoters have invested Rs 4,400 crore in Go Digit General Insurance and Rs 1,400 crore in Go Digit Life Insurance, which are less capital-intensive than reinsurance.Fairfax has many subsidiaries engaged in reinsurance worldwide. These include Odyssey Reinsurance in Connecticut, which underwrites treaty and facultative reinsurance and specialty insurance, Allied World Assurance, which offers reinsurance through its subsidiaries, and Polish Re, which operates in Central and Eastern Europe.Before launching Value Attics, Watsa had attempted to buy ITI Reinsurance from Sudhir Valia, but the deal was rejected by Irdai over concerns that it amounted to trading licences, which is not permitted under Indian regulations. In board meet, Irdai took stock of the progress of Risk-Based Capital implementation and the status of Ind AS adoption in insurance companies, reflecting ongoing efforts to align with global financial standards.","Value attics reinsurance has received a reinsurance licence from insurance regulator irdai.

NEW DELHI: The Centre has asked Elon Musk ’s satellite venture Starlink to set up a control centre in India to enable suspension or shutdown of communications services in sensitive and troubled areas, whenever required, to maintain law and order.Also, the security establishment has specified mandates to allow call interceptions by law-enforcement agencies through official channels when the need arises, top sources told TOI. The move comes as Starlink’s application for a satellite communications licence enters the final phase with the company stitching up agreements with Reliance Jio and Airtel for marketing, deployment and network enhancement.A control centre is important as sudden changes in law-and-order situations in any part of the country may require immediate suspension and shutdown of communications services, including those offered through satellites. We cannot be expected to knock on their (Starlink’s) doors or approach their headquarters in the US whenever such an exigency arises,” a source told TOI, adding the company has assured govt it is looking into the matter.The telecom law has provisions that allow the central or a state govt to even take “temporary possession” of any telecom service or network from an authorised entity in case of a public emergency, including disaster management, or in the interest of public safety. Besides there are provisions for internet shutdown.On the issue of interception, the sources clarified that “it is nothing new” and is also a mandate for the existing terrestrial networks being run by companies such as Jio, Airtel and Vodafone Idea.“For this, the satcom companies have been asked not to transfer calls directly through the satellite network and instead route them back to their India gateway and then use the channel taken by any conventional communication service — such as a call emanating from a landline or a terrestrial mobile phone service,” the source said.If one will use a satellite phone service to call someone in France, then the call will travel from the user and move to the satellite but it will not travel directly to France through the satellite route but return to the company’s India gateway ‘point of presence’ (PoP) before taking conventional telecom channels, such as underseas cable.
