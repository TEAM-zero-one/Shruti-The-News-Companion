DRDO chief answers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/when-will-india-get-its-first-5th-generation-stealth-fighter-drdo-chief-answers/articleshow/120253929.cms,"Poll Do you believe India will successfully develop and deliver the AMCA by 2035? No, it will take longer Yes, definitely

NEW DELHI: India is set to receive its first fifth-generation stealth fighter jet, the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), by 2035, DRDO chairman Samir V Kamat said on Sunday.Acknowledging the long timelines typically associated with developing cutting-edge fighter jet programs, Kamat said, ""If you look at any programme anywhere in the world, it takes 10 to 15 years to develop a new platform. So we have started this journey only in 2024, when the CCS sanctioned the project. So it will take ten years and we have committed to deliver the platform by 2035…""""We want to start an AERO engine programme and we want to collaborate with a foreign OEM to cut down the risks of development. AERO engine technology is a very complex technology, however we have learnt a lot from Kaveri. Kaveri was a fourth generation engine and the current engine technology has moved to sixth generation, so we want to work with foreign OEM to reduce the risks as well as cut down the time for development. Hopefully, we will have some good news on this in the next few months..,"" he added.Talking about other crucial projects that are set to be completed in year, Kamat said, ""There are many projects which are now moving towards maturity. In the next six months to one year, you will see many of our systems getting inducted. VSHORAD, MPATGM, we have LCA Mark II, which will have its first flight, so there are many systems which are now moving towards maturity and in the next six months to one year you will see many of them getting inducted.""The comments came after the defence organisation, for the first time, demonstrated its ability to neutralize fixed-wing aircraft, missiles, and swarm drones using a 30-kilowatt laser-based weapon system.""This is just the beginning of the journey. The synergy that this lab has achieved with other DRDO labs, industry and academia, I am sure we will reach our destination soon... We are also working on other high energy systems like high energy microwaves, electromagnetic pulse. So we are working on a number of technologies that will give us Star Wars capability. What you saw today was one of the components of Star Wars technologies...,"" Kamat said.With this breakthrough, India has joined a select group of nations—such as the US, China, and Russia—that have successfully showcased similar advanced directed-energy capabilities.","India is set to receive its first fifth-generation stealth fighter jet, the advanced medium combat aircraft (amca), by 2035.

BENGALURU: Karnataka HC has directed Google India and three of its top officials to submit 50 per cent of the penalties imposed on them for alleged Foreign Exchange Management Act (Fema) violations in the form of bank guarantees . The penalties include Rs 5 crore on Google India and Rs 45 lakh collectively on three officials.On Jan 11, 2019, the appellate tribunal for Fema cases in Delhi stayed penalties, noting Google India's appeal prospects favourable. ED challenged this through second appeals.ED alleged violations under Fema Sec 6(3)(d), involving Rs 364 crore in transactions, specifically distributor fees to Google Ireland and equipment purchases from Google US. The agency noted that Rs 363 crore owed to Google Ireland remained unpaid for over four years until May 2014, while Rs 1 crore in assets from Google US stayed outstanding for over seven years until Jan 2014. These, it claimed, were commercial loans requiring RBI approval.Google India argued these were not foreign exchange borrowings under Fema, as there were no loan agreements, no deferred payments, and no interest involved. It cited compliance with RBI's circular dated July 1, 2014.A division bench of Justices V Kameshwar Rao and S Rachaiah said the tribunal's stay was only a prima facie view and directed the respondents to furnish bank guarantees for 50% of the penalties within two weeks.","Karnataka hc has directed google india and three of its top officials to submit 50 per cent of the penalties imposed on them for alleged foreign exchange management act (fema) violations in the form of bank guarantees.

Why Erik Arvinder is suddenly being linked to Taylor Swift’s TS12



TS12

Who is Erik Arvinder and why would Taylor Swift pick him now?



Folklore

Evermore

Eras Tour

Red

It all began with a blink-and-you'll-miss-it moment, a now-deleted post, a subtle nudge from Universal Music Sweden, and the sudden appearance of a name that's no stranger to symphonic storytelling. Enter Erik Arvinder , the orchestral genius whose strings have elevated tracks from Coldplay, Lady Gaga, and even Childish Gambino. Now, Swifties are connecting the dots, buzzing with theories that Erik might be secretly orchestrating Taylor Swift’s next sonic shift. From cryptic online crumbs to speculation swirling across fan forums, it’s looking more and more like TS12 could be her most cinematic era yet.If you’ve been following #TS12 updates, you might’ve spotted Erik Arvinder’s name floating around Swiftie timelines recently. But this isn’t just a wild guess. It all began when Universal Music Sweden reportedly posted (then deleted) a video teasing the Swedish conductor’s involvement in Swift’s upcoming album.The post didn’t stay up long, but that was more than enough for the fanbase to latch on. Add in a few suspicious follows, Reddit theories, and the fact that Arvinder’s orchestral work sounds eerily perfect for Taylor’s softer eras and yeah, the pieces started to fall into place.What raised even more eyebrows? The timing. The post surfaced just as rumors aroundheated up again with insiders teasing a late 2025 release. Add in the fact that Taylor hasn’t publicly announced any producers outside of her usual circle yet, and fans are now reading every silence as a sign.Erik Arvinder isn’t a household name, but in the music industry, he’s kind of a legend. He’s worked behind the scenes with Lady Gaga, Ariana Grande, Coldplay, Ed Sheeran, and The Weeknd, often lending cinematic string arrangements that elevate tracks into something… well, emotionally dangerous.That orchestral drama? It sounds right at home withand, doesn’t it? Which is why many believe TS12, especially if it’s an introspective, post-reflection, could use exactly that emotional punch. The timing is also interesting: Arvinder was spotted working on large ensemble projects in early 2025, right when Taylor supposedly began wrapping her new album.Also read - Why do powerful men keep targeting Taylor Swift? Viral thread exposes Elon Musk, Ye, Donald Trump & Andrew Tate’s disturbing pattern Taylor Swift's public acknowledgment of Kelce’s influence, coupled with their undeniable chemistry, has led many to believe that his presence will echo through the emotional depth of the upcoming record. While it remains unclear whether Kelce will feature directly on the album, the signs point toward a significant emotional connection reflected in Swift’s music.There’s no official confirmation (yet) from Taylor or Republic Records. But if the signs are correct, Erik Arvinder could be helping Taylor Swift make her most cinematic, emotionally immersive record to date. And with TS12 rumored to be her “most personal work since,” an orchestral layer feels like the perfect touch.","Erik arvinder is an orchestral genius whose strings have elevated tracks from coldplay, lady gaga, and even childish gambino.

Goldman Sachs has a ‘buy’ recommendation on TCS but has cut target price to Rs 3,960 after the software major’s Jan-March results. Analysts said that both revenue growth and EBIT margins were marginally below the brokerage’s expectations. The company’s flat headcount and deferred wage hike suggest an uncertain growth outlook. TCS is seeing delays in decision-making, with some project ramp downs, and discretionary spends.JP Morgan maintained its ‘overweight’ rating on Tata Steel with a target price of Rs 180. Analysts said the company’s Netherlands transformation program to target Euro 500-million-plus cost savings over FY26-27 is a positive development against a tough macro backdrop. Investor focus in the near term likely remains on the second order impact of demand destruction. They believe Tata’s structural cost reduction initiatives should not be ignored.Motilal Oswal Financial Services has upgraded Interglobe Aviation (Indigo) to ‘buy’ with the target price at Rs 5,550. Calling the airline the ‘best domestic consumption play’, analysts said that the upgrade came as they believed that benign Brent crude prices amid the ongoing geopolitical turmoil and favourable domestic demand bode well for the company.Investec maintained its ‘buy’ recommendation on Sun Pharmaceuticals with a target price of Rs 1,980. Analysts said that the US Federal Circuit court has lifted a preliminary injunction on Leqselvi’s launch in the country, paving the path for its launch. Court case with Incyte shall continue and in case Incyte wins, Sun Pharma could be liable for damages. Believe Incyte’s incentives to settle are low and cannot conclude if they are more willing to settle now. Over the next 2-3 years, Leqselvi’s ramp up is likely to be slow around sub $100 million in sales.Kotak Institutional Equities has downgraded Muthoot Finance to ‘add’ from ‘buy’ and cut target price to Rs 2,250 from Rs 2,400. Analysts cut their estimates by 10% after RBI’s draft guidelines on gold loans potentially reduce maximum LTV for gold loan NBFCs, increase competition from moneylenders and/or reduce IRR on loans. While they await to see the final form of the guidelines, they have moderated their growth and margin assumptions. They remain constructive on gold loan business, but expect an overhang of regulatory changes to temper stock performance.","Goldman sachs has a ‘buy’ recommendation on tcs but has cut target price to rs 3,960 after the software major’s jan-march results.

IHCL’s rapid adoption of asset-light strategy & superior 70-75% EBITDA margins drove 18% CAGR in mngt contract rooms (FY19-24), vs 2% for owned hotels. Expected to account for ~85% of planned room additions in FY26/27. Roots Corp. (RCL), repositioned as lean luxe, achieved 13% revenue and 55% EBITDA CAGRs (FY19-24). Plans for 874 Ginger rooms by FY27 and Qmin integration further leverage managed hotels to sustain growth. New growth segments, Chambers & Taj Sats are expected to contribute 12-14% of IH’s total revenue by FY30E (vs. 2% currently). We estimate adj. PAT to grow at 26% CAGR over FY24–27. With plans to add 8,091 rooms by FY27 (34,521 total keys), it reinforces its position as India’s largest hospitality player, targeting ~65% luxury room share.Oil price decline due to OPEC+ output hike and US tariffs is likely to improve HPCL’s gross marketing margins, which along with the ₹50 price hike imposed by the Center, will help offset ₹76b LPG under-recoveries. Key triggers include the demerger and potential listing of the lubricant business, commissioning of the bottom upgrade unit in Q4FY25, and Rajasthan refinery launch in CY25.For 4Q we expect refining throughput at 6.6mmt (+14% YoY), marketing sales volume at 12.5mmt (+1% YoY), expected GRM at USD5.5/bbl, and gross marketing margin at ₹4.6/lit.

Technology stocks rose after the Trump administration announced a pause in tariffs for phones, computers and consumer electronics, though officials later downplayed the reprieve.Shares of Apple Inc. climbed more than 6% on the Robinhood trading platform.

A gauge of Asian tech stocks climbed as much as 2.6%, boosting the regional benchmark.“We are in a much better spot than Friday” and tech investors “can now breathe a sigh of relief,” Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives wrote in a note. “But still there is mass uncertainty, chaos and confusion about the next steps ahead with all focus on China tariff negotiations being front and center”Late Friday, US Customs and Border Protection published measures excluding such products from the 125% China tariff and baseline 10% global tariff on nearly all other countries.President Donald Trump and other officials pledged over the weekend that tech tariffs are still coming, however. US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick insisted it was only a pause, though the new tech levies will almost certainly be lower than the 125% rate on China. Chip tariffs are “coming in probably a month or two,” Lutnick added.“I think it is ‘net’ reprieve, as the bet that electronics will still be less than the 125% reciprocal on China and that companies get to build buffer now,” said Vishnu Varathan, head of economics and strategy at Mizuho Bank. The biggest beneficiary in Asia around this news will likely be China “temporarily, but I would not take too much solace in that as the guns are still trained on China.”Key Chinese stocks to watch include Luxshare Precision Industry Co. and Lens Technology Co., which get more than half of their sales from Apple.
