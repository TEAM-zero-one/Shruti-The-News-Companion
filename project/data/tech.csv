All those registered on the WAMSI portal will have to register afresh on the Central Waqf Portal, sources in the minority affairs ministry said.Under the new process, the mutawalli (caretaker) will serve as the ‘maker’, entering property details. The Waqf Board official will function as the ‘checker’, reviewing and validating entries. Finally, a designated ‘govt authority’ will act as the ‘approver’, ensuring full verification before records are finalised.According to ministry officials all those who are not registered and do not qualify the three layer check will need to complete the registration formalities to be onboarded on the portal.“This structured process will significantly minimise discrepancies and bring transparency to waqf property registration and monitoring,” the ministry said in a statement on Tuesday after a training session on the portal’s features for a team of master trainers from different states.Officials from various state/UT Waqf Boards attended the workshop.“The Central Waqf Portal, being developed under the Waqf (Amendment) Act, 2025 is poised to be a transformative digital platform that will serve as a centralized repository of Waqf property records across India,” the ministry asserted.There are over 8.7 lakh properties registered as waqf and more than 4.2 lakh are in the category of ‘waqf by user’ as per data shared by states with the ministry.

Doors opened to private sector to join race to develop desi 5th-gen fighters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/doors-opened-to-private-sector-to-join-race-to-develop-desi-5th-gen-fighters/articleshow/121448975.cms,"Photo/Agencies

NEW DELHI: India has finalised a new 'programme execution model' for the indigenous fifth-generation stealth fighter called the advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA), under which private firms can also bid for the project along with defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL).The new model approved by defence minister Rajnath Singh, which aims to accelerate prototype development and induction of the AMCA through a 'robust' domestic aerospace industrial ecosystem, marks a radical departure from the country's long-standing policy of fighter production being solely the preserve of HAL.The defence ministry expects HAL, which has been facing major flak for the huge delay in production of the fourth-generation Tejas Mark-1A jets, to bid for the AMCA project in partnership with one or more private players, officials told TOI.The defence PSU, after all, ""already has its hands full"" with the planned production of 180 Tejas Mark-1A jets for around Rs 1.2 lakh crore, which is slated to be followed by another 108 4.5-generation Tejas Mark-2 jets, apart from several other aircraft and helicopter projects.""Private companies can also bid for the AMCA project independently, or in a joint venture with a foreign OEM (original equipment manufacturer), or as a consortium.It provides equal opportunities to both private and public sectors on a competitive basis. The bidder, of course, should be an Indian company compliant with domestic laws and regulations,"" an official said.""It's an important step towards harnessing indigenous expertise, capability and capacity to produce the twin-engine AMCA prototype. There will be a competition. It will not be handed over to HAL on a nomination basis,"" he added.Towards this end, the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) of DRDO, which is entrusted with designing and developing the 25-tonne AMCA, will soon issue an expression of interest (EoI) for its development phase through industry partnership.The move to accelerate the AMCA project comes at a time when Pakistan is on course to acquire at least 40 J-35A fifth-generation jets from China, which is now even flaunting sixth-generation prototypes with tailless airframes like Chengdu J-36 and Shenyang J-50.The IAF, meanwhile, is grappling with just 30 fighter squadrons (each has 16-18 jets) when 42.5 are authorised. At least eight more squadrons are slated for retirement over the next 10 years.The PM-led cabinet committee on security in March last year had cleared the full-scale engineering development of five AMCA prototypes, along with a structural test specimen, extensive flight testing and certification, by ADA at an initial cost of over Rs 15,000 crore.As per existing timelines, the AMCA with the requisite thrust-to-weight ratio, advanced sensor fusion and stealth features like an internal weapons bay and 'serpentine air-intake' will be ready for production only by 2035.The IAF plans to induct seven squadrons (126 jets) of the expensive AMCA, which will also have AI-powered electronic pilot systems, netcentric warfare systems, integrated vehicle health management and the like.While the first two AMCA squadrons will be powered by the American GE-F414 engines in the 98 Kilonewton thrust class, the next five will have 110 Kilonewton engines.HAL and General Electric are conducting techno-commercial negotiations for co-production of the GE-F414 engines in India, with 80% of transfer of technology for around $1.5 billion.",India has finalised a new 'programme execution model' for the indigenous fifth-generation stealth fighter called the advanced medium combat aircraft.

Salesforce to acquire Informatica for $8 billion in AI-focused data push,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/salesforce-to-acquire-informatica-for-8-billion-in-ai-focused-data-push/articleshow/121442053.cms,"Pic credit- AP

Salesforce announced on Tuesday that it will acquire Informatica for approximately $8 billion, marking its biggest deal since acquiring Slack Technologies in 2021. The move signals a return to large-scale mergers and acquisitions for the cloud software giant as it looks to strengthen its capabilities in the rapidly evolving artificial intelligence market.After previously shelving talks with Informatica last year due to disagreements over terms, Salesforce is now betting that the data management platform can enhance its competitiveness in the AI space. The deal, valued at $25 per share, represents a roughly 30% premium to Informatica’s closing price on May 22, the day before news of renewed negotiations surfaced.Shares of Informatica rose 5.8% in premarket trading to $23.86, while Salesforce was up 1.2%.Buying Informatica will allow Salesforce to expand its suite of data management tools and tighten control over how business data is handled—an increasingly critical factor as the company integrates generative AI across its product offerings, Reuters reported.""Salesforce and Informatica will create the most complete, agent-ready data platform in the industry,"" said Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff, emphasizing that the acquisition will enhance the company’s position in the $150 billion-plus data enterprise market.Salesforce has been actively developing AI agents—software programs capable of handling routine tasks without human intervention—for applications like recruiting and customer service. Its AI platform, Agentforce, has already secured more than 1,000 paid customer deals.Scotiabank analysts noted that the acquisition could help Salesforce better compete with other major software providers, pointing out that ""data management software is now most often sold as part of mega-vendor tool kits.""The deal will be financed through a combination of cash and new debt, with Salesforce expecting to complete the transaction early in its next fiscal year starting February. The company also anticipates the acquisition will begin contributing to operating margin improvements from the second year after closing.Salesforce has a history of high-profile acquisitions, including its $15.7 billion purchase of data analytics firm Tableau Software in 2019. However, those moves came under increased scrutiny in 2023 from activist investors like ValueAct Capital and Elliott Management, who pushed for improved profitability.",Salesforce announced on tuesday that it will acquire informatica for approximately $8 billion.

Nvidia shares rise ahead of earnings as investors eye impact of US chip curbs on China,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/nvidia-shares-rise-ahead-of-earnings-as-investors-eye-impact-of-us-chip-curbs-on-china/articleshow/121444094.cms,"Nvidia shares climbed over 3 per cent to $135.16 in early trading on Tuesday as investors brace for the company’s earnings report due Wednesday, focusing on the financial impact of recent US export restrictions on its China business.Nvidia shares were trading 3.10 per cent higher at $135.36 as of 11:07 am ET.The Biden administration’s export controls, building on measures introduced last year, have limited Nvidia’s ability to sell its advanced H20 AI chip to China. Nvidia has disclosed that these curbs could result in $5.5 billion in charges.CEO Jensen Huang previously estimated the AI chip market in China could reach $50 billion next year but admitted the company had already lost approximately $15 billion in potential sales due to the restrictions, Reuters reported.China accounted for about 13 per cent of Nvidia’s revenue last year, but the company does not break out sales specifically for the H20 chip. Analysts at Wedbush highlighted that the key question for Nvidia’s upcoming earnings will be whether it can compensate for lost sales from the H20 chip and its China operations with growth elsewhere.Despite reports that Nvidia plans to launch a new AI chipset for China based on its latest Blackwell architecture, ongoing uncertainty around China sales has weighed on the stock.Year-to-date, Nvidia’s shares are down about 2 per cent, a sharp contrast to their nearly threefold gain in 2024.“China will probably be the biggest swing factor for Nvidia’s quarter,” said Gil Luria, analyst at D.A. Davidson.Nvidia is expected to report first-quarter revenue of $43.28 billion, representing a 66.2 per cent year-on-year increase, according to LSEG data. However, analysts at Susquehanna estimate the export curbs impacted the final three weeks of the April quarter, costing the company roughly $1 billion in sales. For the remainder of the year, lost revenue could reach $4.5 billion per quarter, Wedbush analysts project a quarterly hit between $3 billion and $4 billion.Gross margins are also expected to take a hit, with Wedbush forecasting an 11 percentage point drop to 67.7 per cent, partly due to write-downs related to H20 shipments, which could reduce margins by as much as 12.5 per cent.Nvidia CEO Huang recently criticized the semiconductor export restrictions as counterproductive, stating they have accelerated Chinese competitors like Huawei’s development of domestic chip technology.On a positive note, easing of some Biden-era export controls under the AI diffusion rule may open up new markets for Nvidia in regions such as the Middle East. Nvidia has already announced plans to supply hundreds of thousands of AI chips to Saudi Arabia, including 18,000 of its Blackwell chips to a start-up backed by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund.Investor confidence has also been bolstered by renewed AI investment from major cloud providers, including Alphabet’s Google, which has pledged continued spending despite earlier concerns of a slowdown.“I don’t think investors’ expectations are very high as we go into it,” said Ivana Delevska, CIO at Spear Invest, which holds Nvidia shares in an actively managed ETF.As Nvidia reports its earnings on Wednesday, all eyes will be on how the company navigates the twin challenges of regulatory restrictions in China and rising AI infrastructure costs.","China accounted for about 13 per cent of nvidia’s revenue last year, but the company does not break out sales specifically for the h20 chip.

Key UPI transactions may face restrictions from August 1 under NPCI’s new API guidelines to prevent outages,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/banking/key-upi-transactions-may-face-restrictions-from-august-1-under-npcis-new-api-guidelines-to-prevent-outages/articleshow/121443387.cms,"Autopay and transaction status APIs also get time-based restrictions

Limits also apply to account listing requests

Starting July 31, 2025, UPI users will face limits on how often they can perform certain non-financial actions like checking account balances or transaction statuses, as the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) moves to regulate API usage across the payment ecosystem. The new framework is aimed at preventing system overloads and improving the reliability of UPI services during peak hours.In a circular issued on May 21, 2025, NPCI directed all banks and Payment Service Providers (PSPs) to moderate and monitor the use of ten high-frequency APIs—requests initiated by users or systems on the UPI network, according to an ET report.These include APIs for balance enquiry, autopay mandate execution, transaction status checks, and account listing. Banks and PSPs have until July 31 to comply, failing which they may face penalties, API restrictions, or suspension of customer onboarding.“PSP banks and/or acquiring banks shall ensure all the API requests (in terms of velocity and TPS — transactions per second limitations) sent to UPI are monitored and moderated in terms of appropriate usage (customer-initiated and PSP system-initiated),” the circular stated.PSPs are also required to submit an undertaking by August 31 affirming that system-initiated APIs are properly rate-limited and queued.Among the most significant changes, balance enquiry API usage will be restricted to 50 requests per app per customer per day. This means users who access multiple UPI apps, such as Paytm and PhonePe, can check balances up to 50 times on each app daily.“This might be an inconvenience to traders and other users who check their balances or transactions extremely frequently,” says Musharraf Hussain, Chief Operating Officer, Ezeepay. “However, this is being done so that UPI’s infrastructure core remains stable and available for use by all.”The circular mandates that apps must discourage balance checks during peak hours (10 AM–1 PM and 5 PM–9:30 PM), and instead, banks will be required to send updated balances with each successful transaction notification. Still, this may reduce the ability for users to get real-time balance updates at will.“Customers might not be able to get a real-time, updated balance of their accounts on PSP apps,” said Pavan Kumar, Chief Product Officer at NPST. However, NPCI has clarified that customers will continue to receive accurate balance updates even after the changes go into effect.Autopay mandates—used for recurring payments like SIPs or subscription services—will now be executed only during non-peak hours, even though customers can continue to create them at any time. “A maximum of 1 attempt, with 3 retries per mandate, can be initiated at moderated TPS only during non-peak hours for autopay mandate,” the circular notes.For the check transaction API, banks and PSPs must now delay the first status check by 90 seconds after transaction authentication and limit checks to three calls within a two-hour window. Certain error codes will result in transactions being treated as failed to avoid unnecessary repeated calls.Furthermore, acquiring banks will now be required to undergo an annual audit by CERT-In empanelled auditors, with the first audit due by August 31 this year.Kumar emphasized that of the ten APIs listed, only one is financial (autopay). “The other nine are non-financial, thereby meaning financial transactions will not be significantly disrupted during peak hours,” he said.Another key API being regulated is the account listing request, which allows users to view all accounts linked to their mobile number. This request will be limited to 25 times per app per customer per day, and will only be allowed once the customer selects their issuer bank in the app. Re-attempts can only be made with explicit customer consent.The new regulations are part of NPCI’s broader strategy to streamline backend infrastructure amid the rising load of real-time payments. By imposing limits on high-frequency API calls, NPCI aims to ensure smoother user experiences, especially during peak transaction windows.","The national payments corporation of india (npci) moves to regulate api usage across the payment ecosystem.

Scott Swift emerges as key figure in shielding Taylor Swift from explosive legal drama

Amid the ongoing legal storm between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni , a new name has come into the spotlight—Taylor Swift’s father, Scott Swift. In a surprising twist, it was Scott who reportedly stepped forward to protect his daughter from being further entangled in the controversy, which centers around Lively’s sexual harassment lawsuit against Baldoni related to the film It Ends With Us.According to court documents cited by the Daily Mail, Taylor Swift's dad, Scott Swift provided crucial information to Justin Baldoni’s legal team. He revealed that Lively had allegedly threatened to leak Taylor Swift’s private text messages unless the pop star publicly supported Lively’s side in the feud. As a result of Scott’s intervention, Taylor was reportedly removed from the legal proceedings altogether.An insider familiar with the situation told the outlet, “Scott Swift did not want his daughter to be dragged into this any further and he voluntarily gave up this information as part of a deal.” The move has been seen by many as a calculated yet protective step by a concerned parent to safeguard Taylor’s reputation and privacy in an increasingly messy legal saga.Court filings by Baldoni’s attorney, Bryan Freedman, assert that Blake Lively’s lawyer, Michael Gottlieb, demanded Taylor’s public support—implying that if she didn’t comply, text messages “of a personal nature” would be released.Lively allegedly also asked Swift to delete their exchanges, suggesting an attempt to erase digital trails.While Lively’s camp has denied any such threats, the judge ultimately ruled that the text message allegations were “improper” and “irrelevant” to the $400 million defamation and extortion lawsuit filed by Baldoni. The result: the subpoena against Taylor Swift was dropped.Adding intrigue to the situation, Taylor’s boyfriend Travis Kelce reportedly unfollowed Ryan Reynolds—Blake Lively’s husband—on Instagram, fueling speculation of loyalty shifts and deepening divisions among the once-close celebrity circle.Taylor Swift, for her part, has maintained her distance. Her representative issued a statement clarifying: “Taylor Swift never set foot on the set of this movie, she was not involved in any casting or creative decisions, and did not see ‘It Ends With Us’ until weeks after its release.”Also Read: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce fuels break up rumors as she looks miserable during their date night amid Blake Lively scandal As the drama continues to unfold, it appears that Scott Swift’s quiet but strategic move may have spared his daughter from a high-profile legal entanglement—and possibly protected her legacy.",Taylor swift's dad scott swift reportedly helped justin baldoni's team.

Billionaire investor Mark Cuban has said that he is not impressed with the design choices of Tesla. Speaking at ""Your Mom's House"" podcast in March, he was asked ‘what's your favorite car?’. Cuban, who owns a Tesla replied with a grin “A Kia. EV6.” He further added “I like it. I'm comfortable with it.”Revealing that he hasn’t sold his Tesla ‘yet’, Mark Cuban explained: “On the Tesla you've got to find [the turn signal] and push the button… while you're driving. You can't pay attention to the road as much.”Praising Kia, he said: “It doesn't try to be too fancy. Your turn signal is like… a turn signal”.While Mark Cuban doesn’t mind driving a ‘cheaper’ Kia EV6, but his 15-year-old son isn’t impressed. When Cuban suggested handing down the car for driving practice, his son quickly shut it down, saying, “It’s not cool, Dad.” He even called it a “nerd car.” Cuban’s response? “Exactly,” he said, embracing the label.Mark Cuban is a known Elon Musk critic. Earlier this year on the ""Club Shay Shay"" podcast, Cuban admitted that he likes provoking Musk because he has ""really thin skin and it just makes it easy.""In another interview earlier this year, Cuban said “I have no problem throwing Elon under the bus, but I'll save it for when it's truly deserved.”Last year, when Musk encouraged users to share more positive content on X, Cuban wasted no time in delivering a sharp retort. “Please post a bit more positive, beautiful or informative content on this platform,” the Tesla CEO then wrote. Cuban commented “You first”.Cuban recently shared an anecdote from a night at COMDEX, which he claims was a major tech trade show in Las Vegas, where he found himself upstaged by none other than Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. At this event, Cuban recalled chatting with a group of women when they suddenly disappeared, only to learn they had left with Gates, who had just taken Microsoft public and was quickly becoming a tech icon. Cuban noted jokingly that Bill Gates took away “his girls.”","Billionaire investor mark cuban has said that he is not impressed with the design choices of tesla.

Read Shaadi.com founder Anupam Mittal’s complete LinkedIn post here

India’s biggest brain drain isn’t to Silicon Valley. It’s to the scroll.

Yes, I believe the next wave of global entrepreneurs will come from India

I have put my money on it

But we’re ALSO building the largest army of thumb warriors - overstimulated, under-inspired people, who're weirdly okay with it.

A billion screens.

A billion brains.

And what do most do with them?

Watch prank videos, swipe choreographed dances, and overdose on AI-generated “wisdom” like it’s roti-sabzi.

We didn’t evolve with media like the West did.

Radio → TV → Cable → Internet

We leapfrogged straight to Reels. And then fell right in

Even my 7-year-old starts with Peppa Pig and ends up in a vortex of glitchy animation and algorithmic chaos.

TikTok, Insta & YT did their job — they captured attention and monetized it.

But what did we lose in the process?

Teens that don’t talk.

Adults that don’t think - just scroll.

With AI, the stimulation will only intensify.

Opportunity?

Dystopia? Also

Feels like a ‘Black Mirror’ episode no one signed up for

This isn’t a call to delete Social apps. It’s not even a solution.

It’s a rant from a concerned father.

And maybe, a conversation about our children.

Curious to hear from other parents, professionals, educators, and entrepreneurs

What are you doing about this?

And how do we make sure the India we’re building doesn’t forget to look up?

Shark Tank India judge Anupam Mittal recently started a debate on social media addiction . In a long LinkedIn post, Mittal said that India’s biggest brain drain isn’t talent leaving for Silicon Valley, but rather millions of minds lost to mindless scrolling. Mittal also expressed his concern over the digital consumption habits of Indians. He said that while the country is moving towards producing the next wave of global entrepreneurs , it is also building an army of overstimulated and under-inspired individuals. A billion screens. A billion brains. And what do most do with them? Watch prank videos, swipe choreographed dances, and overdose on AI-generated ‘wisdom’ like it’s roti-sabzi,” wrote Mittal.Along with this, Mittal also emphasised that unlike the West, which evolved through radio, TV, cable, and then the internet, India jumped straight to Reels—and fell right in. He shared a personal anecdote about his 7-year-old, who starts watching Peppa Pig but ends up in a glitchy vortex of algorithm-driven content.With AI intensifying digital stimulation, Mittal warned that India is raising a generation that doesn’t play, teens that don’t talk, and adults that don’t think—just scroll. “Feels like a ‘Black Mirror’ episode no one signed up for,” he remarked.💪🏼🤷🏼😵‍💫","Shaadi.com founder anupam mittal recently started a debate on social media addiction.

The Indian-American engineer Vaniya Agrawal who disrupted Microsoft's 50th anniversary celebrations in April this year again created disorder at another high-profile Microsoft event. In the latest incident, she disrupted Microsoft's ongoing developer event, Build 2025. Microsoft Build is the company’s annual developers conference. Vaniya Agrawal, along with another fired Microsoft employee Hossam Nasr, shouted at Microsoft’s head of security for AI, Neta Haiby.Haiby was co-hosting a Build session on best security practices for AI, alongside Sarah Bird, Microsoft’s head of responsible AI, when these two former Microsoft employees disrupted the talk to protest against the company’s cloud contracts with the Israeli government. This is the third day in a row that the Microsoft Build 2025 conference has been disrupted by Pro-Palestine protests.On Monday (May 19), shortly after Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella took the stage for his keynote address at the Build 2025 conference, an employee interrupted the speech. The employee started shouting “Free Palestine” and demanded accountability from the CEO for the company’s work with the Israeli government.Next day, on May 20, a Palestinian tech worker interrupted Microsoft executive Jay Parikh's keynote presentation, marking the second consecutive day of pro-Palestine protests at the event. ""Jay! My people are suffering!"" the protester shouted at Parikh, Microsoft's Executive Vice President of CoreAI, during his presentation on Azure AI technology. ""Cut ties! No Azure for apartheid! Free, free Palestine!"" Security personnel quickly escorted the demonstrator from the venue as he continued calling for Microsoft to end its contracts with the Israeli government.Earlier this year, Agrawal disrupted Microsoft’s 50th anniversary celebrations. As Microsoft current CEO Satya Nadella; and former CEOs Steve Ballmer and co-founder Bill Gates sat on stage talking about the company, Vaniya Agrawal stood up and started shouting. “Shame on you all. You’re all hypocrites,” she said. “50,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been murdered with Microsoft technology. How dare you. Shame on all of you for celebrating in their blood. Cut ties with Israel.” Vaniya was escorted out by the security.Microsoft has reportedly Blocked emails with certain words. According to a report in The Verge, ""Microsoft employees have discovered that any emails they send with the terms “Palestine” or “Gaza” are getting temporarily blocked from being sent to recipients inside and outside the company.""A software engineer in the company’s artificial intelligence division, Vaniya Agrawal publicly shared her resignation email last month. She sent the email to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and thousands of Microsoft employees following her protest at the company's 50th anniversary celebration on April 4. In the company-wide email, she wrote that she has been working with the company for over one-and-a-half years.Agrawal was fired shortly after the event. She was asked to go with immediate effect, without completing her two-week notice. The other protester, Ibtihal Aboussad, too was terminated for ""acts of misconduct"" following similar disruptions at the Microsoft Anniversary event.Vaniya Agrawal has been constantly sharing photos of protests around Microsoft Build 2025 venues.

Acer Super ZX hands-on: What are you getting for Rs 10,000

Apple is gearing up for the launch of its next iPhone series – iPhone 17 series in September 2025, continuing its annual tradition of fall releases. The series is rumoured to offer four models this year – iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max and an all-new slim iPhone – iPhone 17 Air. Similar to the past years, iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to be the most-expensive among all models. While official details remain under wraps, leaks and analyst reports suggest that Apple is focusing on both design and performance enhancements this year. The iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to feature a thinner and lighter titanium frame, a smaller Dynamic Island cutout, and notable improvements to its camera system, particularly in low-light and telephoto performance. Here’s what we know about the upcoming iPhone 17 Pro MaxBased on industry leaks and analyst reports, the device is likely to feature a thinner and lighter design, continuing the company’s shift toward titanium frames for durability and weight reduction. Apple is also rumored to reduce the size of the Dynamic Island, offering users a cleaner front display with more screen real estate.The iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to retain its 6.7-inch display size but with slimmer bezels and an upgraded LTPO OLED panel that offers better brightness and power efficiency.Under the hood, the iPhone 17 Pro Max may be powered by the new A19 Pro chip, which could be built on a cutting-edge 2-nanometer process, delivering faster performance and greater energy efficiency, especially for on-device AI applications. Apple is also expected to increase RAM on the device to support more complex multitasking and machine learning tasks.In terms of camera improvements, rumors suggest an upgraded periscope telephoto lens for better zoom and enhanced low-light photography. The front-facing camera could see improvements in both quality and biometric capabilities. It is rumoured that all models under iPhone 17 series may offer a 24MP selfie camera, a major upgrade over the 12MP sensors found in the iPhone 16 series.Battery life may get a boost thanks to efficiency gains and possibly new battery technology. On the software side, iOS 19 is expected to power the device, potentially offering deeper integration of AI features and a more customizable user interface.Pricing is likely to remain in line with the iPhone 15 Pro Max, though more storage options may be introduced. More details are expected to emerge as the launch window approaches.","Apple is gearing up for the launch of its next iphone series - iphone 17 series in september 2025.

President Donald Trump seems quite not-so-happy with Apple's decision to make in India. The US President Donald Trump announced that Apple can build factories in India but will face a 25% tariff on products sold in the US if manufactured overseas. Speaking in the White House Oval Office during the signing of executive orders on nuclear energy, Trump referenced a discussion with Apple CEO Tim Cook , stating, ""I had an understanding with Tim that he wouldn’t be doing this. He said he’s going to India to build plants. I said, ‘That’s okay, but you’re not going to sell into here without tariffs.’""Trump stressed, ""We’re talking about the iPhone. If they’re going to sell it in America, I want it to be built in the United States."" Initially singling out Apple, he later broadened the tariff threat to include all smartphone manufacturers, such as Samsung and Huawei, saying, ""It would be anybody that makes that product, otherwise it wouldn’t be fair."" The tariffs are slated to take effect by the end of June 2025.Earlier in a social media post on the same day, Trump doubled down, writing, ""I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25 per cent must be paid by Apple to the US. American jobs come first!""During a recent trip to Doha, Trump had pressed Cook to focus on US manufacturing , noting India’s high tariffs make it a difficult market for US companies. He added, ""They’ve offered us a deal where they’re willing to charge us no tariff, but I told Tim, ‘I don’t want you building in India. Build here.’"" The US President highlighted that India’s tariff policies, among the highest globally, complicate market access, but he insisted on prioritizing domestic production.Apple CEO Tim Cook, addressing tariffs during Apple’s Q2 2025 earnings call, noted that they are determined by the product’s manufacturing location. Industry experts caution that relocating iPhone production to the US would sharply increase costs due to higher labor and operational expenses. If Apple passes these costs to consumers to maintain profit margins, iPhone prices could soar to $3,000 or more, potentially impacting demand. Analysts also point out that building a US-based supply chain would require significant investment and time, given the complex global network Apple currently relies on, primarily in Asia.The policy has sparked debate, with some economists warning that tariffs could raise consumer prices and disrupt global trade, while supporters argue it could boost US manufacturing jobs. The White House has not yet clarified how the tariffs will be implemented or whether exemptions might apply for companies investing in US facilities.In a related news, Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly declined offer to join tech exectuives and representatives at Trump's recent trip to the Middle East. The choice appeared to irritate Mr. Trump, said a New York Times report.","25% tariff if phones made in india: donald trump targets samsung after threat to apple.

WhatsApp scam: Sending a 'Funny Meme' can now help hackers empty your bank account,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/whatsapp-scam-sending-a-funny-meme-can-now-help-hackers-empty-your-bank-account/articleshow/121410908.cms,"Representatiev image

How the new WhatsApp scam works

How to protect yourself from this WhatsApp scam

Key preventive measures include:

Verify Senders : Always be suspicious of images or messages from unknown numbers. Even if it appears to be from a known contact, if the message seems unusual or out of character, verify it through another communication channel before interacting.

: Always be suspicious of images or messages from unknown numbers. Even if it appears to be from a known contact, if the message seems unusual or out of character, verify it through another communication channel before interacting. Avoid Unknown Downloads: Refrain from downloading any images or attachments from suspicious or unverified sources.

Report Scam Messages: If you receive a message that you suspect is a scam, report it to WhatsApp and block the sender immediately.

A new type of WhatsApp scam is now doing the rounds on the internet. A seemingly innocent act –downloading a funny meme or image on WhatsApp – could be the gateway for fraudsters to compromise your entire digital life, from your bank account to your most private photos. The new scam works on the common habit of sharing and downloading images shared on WhatsApp. Users receive an image, seemingly harmless and perhaps even from a known contact, which, upon download, unleashes malware or spyware onto their mobile device. The deceptive nature of the attack lies in its ability to bypass traditional suspicions, as users are less likely to question content that appears to be a simple picture or meme.Users will receive a meme or image from an unknown number or their own phone contact whose phone may be already compromised. Once the user downloads the image, the malware silently installs on their phone allowing the hackers to steal their banking credentials, social media passwords and also their personal photos.The images shared by hackers often contain some hidden QR codes that redirect the users to phishing websites and expose them to financial fraud. The scam spreads as users unknowingly forward infected images, making them carriers of the malware.Cybersecurity experts are urging WhatsApp users to exercise extreme caution to avoid falling victim to this scam. Pranav Patil, Chief Data Scientist, AdvaRisk told Economic Times, “In today’s world, where messaging apps are ubiquitous, scammers are increasingly turning to social engineering tactics to exploit users. The WhatsApp image download scam is a prime example. Hence the reason why you should disable auto-downloads of any type of media files on WhatsApp. Only download images or files from sources/senders you trust.""","A new type of whatsapp scam is now doing the rounds on the internet.

The action by the US administration, led by President Donald Trump, on revoking the Student and Exchange Visitor Program certification of the prestigious Harvard University, has led to uncertainty and tension for the many hundred Indian students enrolled in many programmes across the Ivy League university.Even though a ruling by a US District Judge Allison Burroughs, in favour of Harvard University late last week, has brought temporary relief for many Indian students studying at the university and several others who were planning to join later this year, worries remain in the long term. However, even as Indian students are hit hard by the US government’s action against the university, several Indian Americans hold leadership positions across Harvard, especially at Harvard Business School.Here are some of the prominent desi faces one is likely to see at the Ivy League campus in Cambridge, Massachusetts:has been the dean of Harvard Business School since January 2021. At HBS, he has served as senior associate dean for university affairs (including faculty chair of the Harvard Innovation Lab), for research, for executive education, for faculty development, and faculty recruiting.

EU launches probe into four porn websites over child safety concerns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/eu-launches-probe-into-four-porn-websites-over-child-safety-concerns/articleshow/121436163.cms,"



The European Commission has launched an investigation into four major adult websites including Pornhub, Stripchat, XNXX, and XVideos.The probe concerns whether these porn websites are failing to protect children online. The inquiry centres on whether they are breaching new rules under the Digital Services Act (DSA), which aims to make the internet safer, especially for minors.The DSA, the EU’s rulebook for large online platforms, requires companies to take strong steps to shield users from harmful or illegal content. This includes ensuring that children cannot easily access adult material, possibly through age-verification tools. “The online space should be a safe environment for children to learn and connect,” Henna Virkkunen, the EU’s top technology enforcer, was quoted as saying to the Financial Times. “Our priority is to protect minors and allow them to navigate safely online.”The commission’s probe began after reviewing internal company data and formal responses from the platforms. It found that the current safety measures do not adequately reduce the risks to children.In particular, the sites were criticised for lacking effective age verification and for not having proper privacy, safety, and security protections for minors.In parallel, EU member states have coordinated a crackdown on smaller pornographic websites under their own national laws, aiming for consistent enforcement of the DSA throughout the bloc. If the major platforms do not comply, they could face interim actions or hefty fines, up to 6 per cent of their global turnover.The commission also revealed that Stripchat will soon be removed from the list of “very large online platforms” under the DSA rules, meaning it will no longer be subject to the strictest requirements.Global regulators have long struggled to police user-generated content sites, which depend on individuals posting material and have often been accused of hosting harmful or illegal content. Pornographic websites have been particularly challenging to control.Addressing concerns about censorship, a commission official said the EU is “agnostic to the content” and is focused solely on ensuring platforms follow the rules, reports Finacial Times.Furthermore, Brussels is developing an EU-wide age-verification app. This tool will allow platforms to confirm users are over 18 without sharing additional personal details. It is expected to be available later this year.","The european commission has launched an investigation into four major adult websites including pornhub, stripchat, xnxx, and xvideos.
