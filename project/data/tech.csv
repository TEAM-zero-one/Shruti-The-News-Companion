AI Impact Summit: Facing Backlash Over China-made Robo Dog, Galgotias University Told To Leave Event

NEW DELHI: IT secretary S Krishnan on Wednesday said that exhibitors at the AI Impact Summit must not display items that do not belong to them, as a controversy continued over a Chinese-made robotic dog showcased by Galgotias University.“Exhibitors must not display items that are not their,” Krishnan said, amid questions over the display of the robot at the summit venue in New Delhi, news agency PTI reported.The IT secretary said that the government wants only genuine work to be showcased at such platforms and stressed the need to avoid disputes over exhibits.“We want genuine and actual work to be reflected in the way that people exhibit in expos. The idea is not to sort of use this as an opportunity in any other fashion. We don't want the controversy surrounding the exhibits presented here. So I think it's essential that a code is followed there. Misinformation cannot be encouraged. So we don't want the controversy around this. I'm not getting into whether they are right or wrong. We just don't want the controversy.”The controversy erupted during the AI Impact Summit 2026 , held at Bharat Mandapam after a robotic dog exhibited by the university under the name “Orion” was identified as the Unitree Go2, a commercially available quadruped robot manufactured by Chinese firm Unitree Robotics and sold in India for around Rs 2–3 lakh.The summit, inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi is positioned as a flagship event to showcase India’s advancements in artificial intelligence. The display drew criticism as the machine was alleged to have been presented as an in-house innovation at an event focused on promoting domestic AI capabilities.Government sources earlier said that the university was asked to vacate its stall following the row, and its pavilion’s power supply was reportedly cut off after it was directed to leave the expo.In a press statement issued after being asked to vacate the premises, the university expressed regret over the confusion and said it arose because Professor Neha Singh, who was managing the stall, was unaware of the product’s technical origins.“We at Galgotias University wish to apologise profusely for the confusion created at the recent AI Summit. One of our representatives, manning the pavilion, was ill-informed. She was not aware of the technical origins of the product and in her enthusiasm of being on camera, gave factually incorrect information even though she was not authorised to speak to the press... Understanding the organisers’ sentiment we have vacated the premises,” the statement read.The issue escalated after Professor Singh, while presenting the robot to DD News, said, “We are the first private university investing more than 350 crore rupees in artificial intelligence… So Orion has been developed by the Center of Excellences and as you can see, it can take all shapes and sizes.” She also described the robot as capable of surveillance and monitoring tasks.Her remarks triggered scrutiny after observers recognised the machine as an off-the-shelf product sold globally by Unitree Robotics.In an earlier clarification, the university said it had neither built nor claimed to have built the robotic dog, and that its objective was to help students learn using globally available technologies.“Let us be clear - Galgotias has not built this robodog, neither have we claimed. But what we are building are minds that will soon design, engineer, and manufacture such technologies right here in Bharat,” it said.Professor Singh later said the controversy stemmed from a lack of clarity in communication and that the university had introduced the robot to inspire students, not to claim manufacturing credit.",It secretary s krishnan said exhibitors at ai impact summit must not display items that do not belong to them.

University issues clarification

NEW DELHI: Galgotias University was asked to vacate its stall at the AI Summit Expo in Bharat Mandapam on Wednesday after a robotic dog displayed at its booth as an in-house innovation was identified as a commercially available Chinese product, said government sources.The robot, showcased by the university as “Orion,” was recognised by observers as the Unitree Go2 made by Chinese robotics firm Unitree. The incident quickly escalated into a wider controversy at the India AI Impact Summit 2026 , a flagship AI event inaugurated by PM Modi.The robotic dog displayed at the university’s stall was identified as the Unitree Go2, a commercially available quadruped robot sold in India for about Rs 2–3 lakh.Critics said the robot was presented at the summit as a product developed by the university, raising questions about showcasing imported technology at a national AI event meant to highlight domestic innovation.After scrutiny intensified, power at the Galgotias University pavilion at the AI Summit was also reportedly cut off after it was asked to vacate the expo.Professor Neha Singh, while presenting the robot earlier, told DD News, ""We are the first private university investing more than 350 crore rupees in artificial intelligence and we have a dedicated data science and artificial intelligence block on the campus. So Orion has been developed by the Center of Excellences and as you can see, it can take all shapes and sizes.”“It's quite naughty also. It's quite naughty also and it can perform small tasks of surveillance, monitoring,” she added.The controversy drew sharp reactions from opposition. The Congress said on X: “The Modi government has made a laughing stock of India globally, with regard to AI. In the ongoing AI summit, Chinese robots are being displayed as our own. The Chinese media has mocked us. This is truly embarrassing for India. What is even more shameful is the fact that Modi’s minister Ashwini Vaishnaw is indulging in the same falsehood, promoting China's robots at the Indian summit. """"The Modi Government has caused irreparable damage to the image of the country - they have reduced AI to a joke - a field in which we could be world leaders given our data power,"" it added.Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi called the summit a “disorganised PR spectacle.” In a post on X, he said, “Instead of leveraging India's talent and data, the AI summit is a disorganised PR spectacle - Indian data up for sale, Chinese products showcased.”In the first statement, Galgotias University said it had not built or claimed to have built the robotic dog and emphasised its focus on student learning through exposure to advanced global technologies.""Let us be clear - Galgotias has not built this robodog,neither have we claimed. But what we are building are minds that will soon design, engineer, and manufacture such technologies right here in Bharat. Innovation knows no borders. Learning should not either. We will continue to source the best technologies from across the world so our students can study them, challenge them, improve upon them—and ultimately create world-class solutions from India for the world. ""In a later statement, the university said concerns about “propaganda” against the university were misplaced.“We at Galgotias, faculty and students, are deeply pained by the propaganda campaign against our university. We would like to clearly state that the robotic programming is part of our endeavour to make students learn Al programming and develop & deploy real world skills using globally available tools and resources, given developing Al talent is need of an hour.”Professor Neha Singh, who was representing the university, said the controversy stemmed from unclear communication.“The controversy happened because things may not have been expressed clearly. I take accountability that perhaps I did not communicate it properly, as it was done with a lot of energy and enthusiasm and very quickly, so I may not have come across as eloquently as I usually do. Also, the intent may not have been properly understood. One important point is regarding the robot dog—we cannot claim that we manufactured it. I have told everyone that we introduced it to our students to inspire them to create something better on their own. Our university contributes to building future leaders by providing cutting-edge technologies in the field of AI, and it will continue to do so.”The summit’s focus on India’s AI ambitions was overshadowed after observers identified the robot as the Unitree Go2, a model sold by Chinese robotics company Unitree.","The robot, showcased by the university as “orion,” was recognised by observers as the unitree go2 made by chinese robotics firm unitree.

NEW DELHI: Galgotias University on Wednesday issued an apology and went into damage control, pinning the entire blame on the Professor who was tasked with manning the pavilion, after a massive controversy erupted over its false claims around ‘in-house innovation’ displays at its booths at the ongoing AI Impact Summit 2026.In its apology, the university said the Professor Neha Singh , in-charge of its pavilion was “ill-informed”, and “didn’t know about the technical origins of the product” on display. The press release further blamed her for getting over enthusiastic in front of the camera and talking to the media, even though she wasn’t authorised to speak to the press.The apology came in stark contrast to Galgotias earlier statements, where the University had categorically termed the incident as a “propaganda campaign” against the institute, after saying that they never said it had not built or claimed to have built the robotic dog and emphasised its focus on student learning through exposure to advanced global technologies.In its initial statement after the controversy broke, University asserted that it had not built or claimed to have built the robotic dog and highlighted its focus on student learning.""Let us be clear - Galgotias has not built this robodog,neither have we claimed. But what we are building are minds that will soon design, engineer, and manufacture such technologies right here in Bharat. Innovation knows no borders.Learning should not either. We will continue to source the best technologies from across the world so our students can study them, challenge them, improve upon them—and ultimately create world-class solutions from India for the world. ”The university maintained that exposure to global technologies was part of its academic mission and that the robot was meant for student learning and experimentation.In a subsequent statement, the university escalated its defence, alleging that it was being targeted.“We at Galgotias, faculty and students, are deeply pained by the propaganda campaign against our university. We would like to clearly state that the robotic programming is part of our endeavour to make students learn Al programming and develop & deploy real world skills using globally available tools and resources, given developing Al talent is need of an hour.”Professor Neha Singh, who was representing the university at the summit, later issued her own clarification.“The controversy happened because things may not have been expressed clearly.

She was not aware of the technical origins of the product and in her enthusiasm of being on camera, gave factually incorrect information even though she was not authorised to speak to the press,” the statement read.The apology went on to say the incident was not an intentional act, clarifying no “institutional intent” behind the “misrepresentation” of the innovation.It said, “We request your kind understanding as there was no institutional intent to misrepresent this innovation. Galgotias University remains firmly committed to academic integrity, transparency, and responsible representation of our work. Understanding the organisers sentiment we have vacated the premises.”The controversy began after the robotic dog displayed at the university’s stall was identified as the Unitree Go2, a commercially available quadruped robot sold in India for about Rs 2–3 lakh and manufactured by Chinese robotics firm Unitree.Critics alleged that the robot was presented at the summit as a product developed by the university, raising questions about showcasing imported technology at a national AI event meant to highlight domestic innovation.After scrutiny intensified, power at the Galgotias University pavilion at the AI Summit was reportedly cut off after it was asked to vacate the expo.Later, another product a ""soccer drone arena"" also claimed to be an in-house innovation by the University was found to be false, as many on social media highlighted its similarity already available South Korean product named 'Stryker V3 ARF' available in the market.Professor Neha Singh, while presenting the robot earlier, told DD News, ""We are the first private university investing more than 350 crore rupees in artificial intelligence and we have a dedicated data science and artificial intelligence block on the campus.

What triggered the row

NEW DELHI: The controversy around Galgotias University’s displays at its booth at the ongoing India AI Impact Summit 2026 as an in-house innovation, has escalated further, with fresh scrutiny now focusing on another device showcased by the institution.Barely 24 hours after being asked to vacate its stall at the flagship AI summit in the national capital, it is now facing questions over a “drone soccer arena” that faculty members claimed was developed entirely in-house.In a video now going viral on social media, the university’s communications professor is seen speaking about a “drone soccer arena”, calling it another in-house innovation and claiming it to be “India’s first” such system.“It is a very interesting thing, from its end to end engineering to its application, everything has been done at the university and this is India's first drone soccer arena which you will get to see on campus at Galgotias and here the children play games inside this arena, fly it, enhance their flagging skills and are developing it in a new way, with more strength and enhanced features, what are these things,” she says.However, several posts on social media have rebutted the assertions, alleging that the drone closely resembles a commercially available product from South Korea.Users have pointed to Helsel, which says it pioneered drone soccer in 2015 before launching the sport in South Korea in 2017. The sport is recognised by the World Air Sports Federation. Some users have also claimed that the device resembles products such as the Stryker V3 ARF available in the market.The Youth Congress also weighed in on X, alleging that the drone was a Korean-made product and questioning the university’s claims.Taking a jibe at PM Modi it said, ""First China, now Korea. Galgotias is on a world tour of 'borrowed' innovation. They claimed to have built India’s first Drone Soccer from scratch on campus, but it’s actually just a Striker V3 ARF from Korea. Atmanirbhar’ or just ‘Atmanir-buy’ Modi ji?""Earlier a robotic dog showcased by the university as “Orion,” was recognised by observers as the Unitree Go2 made by Chinese robotics firm Unitree. The incident quickly escalated into a wider controversy at the Summit, a flagship AI event inaugurated by PM Modi.The university has not issued a fresh clarification regarding the drone allegations. Earlier, in a press release regarding the robodog controversy the institute had termed it a ‘propaganda’.The robotic dog showcased at the university’s stall was identified as the Unitree Go2, a commercially available quadruped robot that is sold in India at an estimated price of Rs 2–3 lakh.Critics alleged that the robot was projected at the summit as an in-house innovation by the university, prompting questions over the display of imported technology at a national AI platform intended to spotlight indigenous developments.As scrutiny mounted, electricity supply to the university’s pavilion at the AI Summit was reportedly disconnected after organisers asked the institution to vacate the exhibition space. Government sources later confirmed that authorities had directed the university to vacate the expo area, stressing compliance and transparency standards at the summit.During an earlier presentation of the robot, Professor Neha Singh told DD News that the university had made significant investments in artificial intelligence.She said, “We are the first private university investing more than 350 crore rupees in artificial intelligence and we have a dedicated data science and artificial intelligence block on the campus. So Orion has been developed by the Center of Excellences and as you can see, it can take all shapes and sizes.”Describing its functions, she added, “It's quite naughty also.

What can Estonia offer to the world and India in terms of AI and tech?

AI is still developing so fast. We don't know what's going on, let's say in three months or even two weeks.

Could you give us a sense of the digitalisation that has happened in Estonia?

How are you ensuring privacy of data?

What has been the increase in productivity as a result of digitalisation?

What are the areas of cooperation you see with India?

What are your views on regulation of AI?

Estonia is widely using AI in edu and wants to collaborate with India. In an interview with TOI’s Surojit Gupta, Estonia’s President Alar Karis talks about how they’ve built trust while rolling out citizen-centric e-services. Excerpts:n We can provide to India and the rest of the world our experience and how we digitalised our society. One important thing we should share with the rest of our world is how we are building trust when we go for digitisation or using AI. You should build trust not only between technologies, but also between govts and societies as a whole.But we are prepared and we try to use this new technology smartly. This is what we can tell India. India is also a digitalised country, so we learn from each other.In Estonia, everything is online. That means you can even get married online. I mentioned tax, I mentioned prescriptions, basically everything. One startup, instead of using lawyers, is using AI. It doesn't mean we don't need lawyers anymore, but we can focus on things which are more important as there are queues in Estonia to get to the court.Privacy is getting more and more important with AI technology. Data may belong to citizens, but data privacy, especially medical care, is a concern. We see in Europe, in some countries, how difficult it is to introduce ID cards as people are concerned about the data.Someone has calculated that it has raised GDP by 5%. That is a calculation that's just done by officials. It makes your life very comfortable. In some countries, it's very difficult to fill up the tax forms. For us, it's pre-filled. It takes maybe a couple of minutes if you don't have anything to add. It makes the whole thing transparent. For medical prescriptions, you don't have to go to a doctor. He knows what your illnesses are and they give you a prescription, you see it right away and you go to a pharmacy.Like India, Estonia values education. We can collaborate on this. We started AI Leap. We provided computer access to schools 30 years ago. Now, we are doing the same with AI. We teach teachers and students how to use AI smartly. We've collaboration with OpenAI and Google and asked them to provide a platform that suits students' needs in Estonia. AI Leap is in every school and we are learning how to use it and how to actually change the whole system of how we teach students.Regulations are needed. We try to ensure there are worldwide regulations, at least on a certain level. But every country is different. There are limits with technology and there are rules and regulations.","Estonia is widely using ai in edu and wants to collaborate with india.

Why GenAI appeals to kids

New Delhi: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is fast becoming part of children's learning routines in India, but a deep misconception about what the technology actually does is spreading just as quickly. Bharat Survey for EdTech 2025, released by Central Square Foundation on Wednesday, showed 35% of children who already use edtech are using GenAI tools for learning, even as nearly three-fourths of GenAI-aware children wrongly believe these tools are simply internet search engines.The survey, conducted between July 2025 and Jan 2026 covering 12,500 households and 2,500 teachers across 10 states, showed that for children from low-income households, GenAI adoption is no more experimental: 96% use it multiple times a week, and 69% operate it daily.Yet, understanding lags sharply behind usage. While 85% of GenAI-aware children said they understood how it works, 72% equated it with a search application, blurring the line between probabilistic AI-generated responses and verified online information.This gap is critical as 46% of respondents flagged ""wrong information"" as a key risk associated with edtech and GenAI use, alongside concerns about overuse.The report showed that children were primarily using GenAI for school-linked activities, with 73% relying on it for doubt-solving and practice, 48% for learning new skills or language translation, and 32% for test preparation.The main attractions are easy-to-understand explanations (45%), quick responses that save time (41%), and interactive formats (40%) - features that make GenAI especially appealing in homes where adult academic support may be limited.However, experts warned that high-frequency use without foundational AI literacy could amplify risks.The New Delhi-based NGO said the findings highlighted an urgent need to move beyond access and adoption metrics.",Generative artificial intelligence (genai) is fast becoming part of children's learning routines in india.

‘Social Media Curbs For Children Only After Careful Consideration’

New Delhi: Union IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Wednesday underlined the need to strike a balance between development of artificial intelligence and regulation, and asserted that govt will use a mix of technical regulations and laws going forward.""India's approach has been a techno-legal approach, a combination of using technical solutions, and legal structures. That approach is now appreciated by the global community. Some geographies have in the past used only regulation or a legal approach. That has not really delivered the kind of results which are needed,"" the minister told TOI in an interview.Given that innovations have a long runway, heavy regulation may not be required at this stage. ""This is probably the first innings of the first match of a test series,"" he quipped.The minister said Big Tech ""is pretty much working in sync"" with society and policymakers.Asked about restricting access of children to social media, Vaishnaw said that currently discussions are underway. ""There is a discussion going on about the impact of social media on children and how it should be dealt with. Several countries have imposed restrictions and prohibitions and in India too, industry and public other stakeholders are discussing the issue.The right solution will emerge only through thoughtful deliberation. ""He also said that AI offered a lot of opportunities for Indian IT companies.""The IT industry is also very cognizant of the challenges and they are pivoting very rapidly away from the old model to create a new model of providing services, from software as a service to AI-based services. There are thousands and thousands of legacy systems in the world. Those legacy systems will have to be modernised, and our IT services companies are best placed to modernise them, using the new AI-based solutions,"" Vaishnaw said, adding that the govt, academia and industry are harmonised.Asked about the PM's comments asking IT companies to diversify beyond services to products and platforms, the minister said industry is calibrating these changes. ""They were trying to measure what this change would bring to their sector... Lots and lots of very focused, small models is what the IT industry is putting their emphasis on, which can be placed in an enterprise where trust is the most important factor,"" he said.Vaishnaw added that the IT industry has devised a bouquet of small models, and our sovereign models are complementing that.","Union it minister ashwini vaishnaw underlined the need to strike a balance between development of artificial intelligence and regulation.

AI is now in every part of the space sector. Keeping this in mind, we have announced this new seed fund for any applicant that can replace any traditional method in the space sector with an AI application. We will invite applications from such startups, companies or even persons, and shortlist such five entities and provide them a grant of Rs 1 crore each for such AI applications.So, a total of Rs 6 crore has been announced.”When asked whether this grant amount will be increased, the director said, “Rs 6 crore is the initial seed fund. Rs 1 crore is sufficient for the application part. When any company’s idea is built up, then we have the technology adoption fund for that purpose, there we will provide the company Rs 35 crore. Even up to Rs 60 crore venture capital fund is available for such companies.” The last date for receipt of applications is March 20.On how prevalent is AI in Isro’s day-to-day work, the INSPACe director said, “AI is used for data analytics like hazard detection, AI is being used for processing data from satellites, and even human robot ‘Vyommitra’ developed for the Gaganyaan mission is also using AI. Even for the ground testing of a satellite we are using AI. For example, checking any crack in thousands of solar cells, we use AI. AI has entered our system. ”He also disclosed that “a fully autonomous and advanced version of Vyommitra, based on AI, will be used in the upcoming Bharatiya Antariksh Station that will come up by 2035”.On how INSPACe is helping startups, the director said, “Currently, there are 390 space startups. We have received 850+ applications from startups in various aspects of the space sector, who are seeking our help. There are 12 courses we have designed in the space sector. And, over 58 colleges have added space applications in their curriculum. Many private companies have set up their own space facilities. But where companies are not able to have their own set up, INSPACe or Isro provide them help or do the hand-holding. ”The director said, “Both space and AI are burgeoning sectors, and their convergence holds strong potential to transform how we explore and operate in complex and remote environments through autonomous and intelligent decision making. We are keen to see how non-govt entities use this opportunity to develop solutions that serve national priorities over the long term.”","The seed fund initiative is aimed at accelerating ai-driven innovation across india’s private space ecosystem. The last date for receipt of applications is march 20. A fully autonomous and advanced version of vyommitra, based on ai, will be used in the upcoming bharatiya antariksh station.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128523809,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-124195,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

High-profile attendees of the December 2025 event from the cryptocurrency, international finance, and political sectors had their personal information compromised in the security breach. Over 35,000 people attended the event.According to documents reviewed by the Financial Times (FT), scans of more than 700 passports and state identity cards were found on an unprotected cloud storage server linked to the state-sponsored investment conference. This includes data of former British Prime Minister Lord David Cameron, billionaire hedge fund manager Alan Howard, and former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci.Other prominent individuals whose details were disclosed included Richard Teng, co-chief executive of crypto exchange Binance and former chief of ADGM, and Lucie Berger, the EU's ambassador to the UAE, the FT reports, citing a sample of files reviewed.Roni Suchowski, a freelance security researcher and consultant, identified the issue and said that the exposed data could be accessed by anyone using a standard web browser.After the FT contacted ADFW about the data exposure this week, the server was secured. Cybersecurity experts said the lapse could harm the Gulf state's reputation, which frequently hosts international conferences and emphasises its security arrangements.Suchowski identified the data exposure using commonly available software that scans cloud services for unsecured information. He said the dataset, which included tens of thousands of publicly accessible files, such as passports, ID cards, and ADFW invoices, was likely exposed for at least two months. He added that earlier attempts to alert ADFW had been unsuccessful, which prompted him to contact the FT.in cases of data breaches to protect affected individuals, Suchowski told the publication.the researcher added.Complete passport scans can be valuable to fraudsters operating on the dark web.

What Sarvam AI has demonstrated - world class AI can be done much more affordably and sustainably with much lower energy and compute footprint - is important.

I have come to believe that in software code generation, much more energy and compute efficient approaches to AI can be developed.

That is important because the earth cannot afford today's AI energy footprint.

Sridhar Vembu has said that artificial intelligence (AI) can be developed in a more affordable and sustainable way, with far lower energy and computing needs than what is commonly used today. In a post shared on X (formerly known as Twitter), Vembu pointed to the work done by Sarvam AI as an example of how high-quality AI systems can be built without heavy reliance on large-scale infrastructure. For those unaware, Sarvam AI is an AI model founded by IIT alumni – Pratyush Kumar and Vivek Raghavan. The Bengaluru-based startup recently claimed that the AI model has outperformed some of the biggest names in artificial intelligence, including Google Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.In the post, Vembu said Sarvam AI’s work shows that “world-class AI” does not require excessive compute power or energy consumption. He added that this approach is important as concerns grow over the environmental impact of large AI models, which rely on energy-intensive data centres.The Zoho founder also said he believes software code generation, in particular, offers scope for more efficient AI techniques. According to Vembu, new approaches could significantly reduce the energy and compute footprint needed to build and run such systems.Sridhar Vembu further warned that the current trajectory of AI development may not be sustainable in the long run. Vembu said the planet cannot support the rising energy demands of today’s AI models, highlighting the need for alternatives that balance performance with environmental responsibility.His comments come amid broader global debate over the cost, scalability, and environmental impact of advanced AI systems, as companies continue to invest heavily in computing infrastructure to train and deploy large models.","Sridhar vembu said sarvam ai's work shows that ‘world-class ai’ does not require excessive compute power or energy consumption.

Instagram’s beauty filters and free expression



Underage users and enforcement



Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has testified in Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday (February 18). According to a report by CNBC, Zuckerberg informed that court that he had reached out to Apple CEO Tim Cook in 2018 to discuss the ‘well being of teens and kids’. The comments from Meta CEO came after the defense lawyers presented emails between the two executives, aiming to highlight that Zuckerberg was proactive about the safety of kids and teens on Instagram . “I care about the wellbeing of teens and kids who are using our services,” Zuckerberg said.The central issue in the trial is whether Instagram’s beauty filters harmed young users. Lawyers pressed Zuckerberg on internal discussions about banning cosmetic surgery filters after experts warned that these filters will have negative impact of the teenage girls. The report adds that Zuckernger acknowledged the concerns but mentioned that the decision came down to free expression. “I genuinely want to err on the side of giving people the ability to express themselves,” he testified.Along with this, the case also centers on the allegations that Meta designed Instagram to maximise the time spent on the app. However, Zuckerberg pushed back, saying that the engagement metrics were used as internal milestones rather than company goals.The evidence presented in the court included documents from Instagram chief Adam Mosseri, showing targets to increase daily user time to 40 minutes in 2023 and 46 minutes in 2026.The lawyers also questioned whether Meta adequately prevents under-13 users from joining Instagram. As the documents presented before the court revealed that nearly 4 million children under the age of 13 are using the platform in the US. Replying to the question, Meta CEO admitted that some users lie about their age but he also said that Meta removes underage accounts when identified and Instagram only began requiring birthdays at sign‑up in late 2019.The trial also saw unusual moments, with Judge Carolyn B. Kuhl warning that anyone using AI smart glasses during testimony would be held in contempt. Members of Zuckerberg’s team were photographed wearing Meta’s Ray‑Ban AI glasses before entering the courthouse.The Los Angeles case is one of several lawsuits this year accusing social media companies of harming young users’ mental health.

(Image via Getty)

Cam Newton show was over and he found out from a late-night email

Cam Newton is already turning the ‘106 & Sports’ check into a 2026 college tailgate tour

Former NFL MVP Cam Newton’s BET show ""106 & Sports"" is done after just eight episodes. BET told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution it will not order another season after the 2025 run, though the episodes from Oct. 15 to Dec. 3 remain on BET platforms.The news hit in mid-February 2026, months after taping wrapped. It comes right as Newton’s own comments and podcasts are back in the spotlight and just as he says he found out he was canceled by email, not a phone call. Instead of sitting in that, he is already flipping the short TV run into a 2026 college tailgate tour.""106 & Sports"" was built as a sports spin on ""106 & Park,"" co-hosted by Newton and Ashley Nicole Moss, produced by LeBron James and Maverick Carter’s SpringHill Company, and filmed at Tyler Perry Studios in Atlanta. It pulled in names like Brittney Griner, Claressa Shields, and Chad Johnson but never found the ratings or engagement BET wanted during a wider leadership reset at the network.On his ""4th&1 with Cam Newton"" podcast, Newton said he found out the Cam Newton show was done while going through a new rundown that suddenly turned into a cancellation notice. “When the show got sent to me, and I went through it, I said, okay, this [is] the hot topic.This is the first step. Hold on. What? We want it done,” he said. “Oh my goodness. I said, I thought we were going, I thought we had chemistry, I thought we had an understanding. I thought we were locked in.”He added that the email blindsided him late at night. “It’s unfortunate, though. That’s how I found out. Dang. I found out when you sent the show. And how it typically works, you typically send a show the day before. These are the topics that we are thinking about. I was completely taken aback. Clenched pearls.”Newton also made it clear it was never technically his show. BET and SpringHill owned it. He was on-air talent attached to a brand he called “something so prestigious, so iconic, something so cultural, and black with the 106 name.”Moss publicly showed support for everyone involved, writing on X that she was sad the show would not continue and wishing Newton and the crew well. The tone from her side has stayed professional, even as fans debate whether low ratings, BET’s strategy shift, or Newton’s own comments helped push the series to a quick end.Whatever the mix of reasons, the cancellation of the Cam Newton Show became official in February 2026. Newton has already moved the conversation to what comes next. On the same ""4th&1"" episode, he said he plans to pour the money he made from ""106 & Sports"" straight into his own project. “In the fall of 2026, I’m going to take every nickel, penny, dime, dollar that was given to me on this project. I’m going to reinvest it with the 4th&1 with Cam Newton College tailgate,” he said.He laid out a tour that hits HBCUs, PWIs, and campuses across the country, built around showing up in person and tapping into each school’s culture. In his words, “when you have the backing of Iconic Saga, when you have the backing of producers like yourself with people that share the vision of what you want, it’s HBCUs, it’s PWIs, it’s colleges around the nation and universities around the nation that we’re able to go on campus and garner their culture. ”Newton has already built a second act across TV and digital. He has a multi-year deal with ESPN and a growing role on ""First Take,"" while ""Funky Friday"" and ""4th&1 with Cam Newton"" give him direct access to his audience on YouTube and podcast feeds. Even with ""106 & Sports"" gone after a short 2025 run, he is treating it as a paid lesson and a launchpad, not a dead end.","Cam newton's bet show ""106 & sports"" is done after just eight episodes.
