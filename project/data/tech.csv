Deepfake Shock: Nirmala Sitharaman Reveals Fake Videos Of Herself Online, Warns Of AI’s Dark Side

Armour up with TOI to fight deepening threat of deepfakes





In a world where seeing is no longer believing, India is facing a new digital menace: AI-generated deepfakes.These hyper-realistic videos and audio clips don’t just distort reality. They manipulate public perception, spread misinformation and undermine trust in democracy itself.With 85.5 per cent of Indian households owning at least one smartphone, mobile phones have become India’s bank, classroom and television, making citizens more vulnerable to digital deception.During the 2024 elections, for instance, satirical deepfakes became a campaign tool of sorts. Apart from resurrecting dead leaders, it featured clips such as one that featured PM Narendra Modi dancing the garba with women and Kamal Nath dissing a popular welfare scheme.Though investigations and arrests followed, such videos blur the line between fact and fiction, risking the distortion of voter opinion and the integrity of the democratic process.Cybersecurity experts warn AI is also becoming a key tool in cybercrime: 80 per cent phishing campaigns in 2024 involved AI, with deepfakes exploited for scams.“When you can fake images, audio, and video, how do you know if a real video is real? Suddenly, everything is in question,” said Hany Farid, professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in a TOI interview last year about the worrying rise in AI misuse.The deepfake threat extends beyond politics. Recently, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman highlighted the misuse of AI to clone voices and produce fake videos impersonating her, warning of potential financial scams and the erosion of public trust. “I have seen several deepfake videos of myself being circulated online, manipulated to mislead citizens and distort facts,” Sitharaman said in Mumbai. “Criminals are using AI to mimic voices, clone identities, and create lifelike videos,” she added.Given that over 97% of India’s urban youth aged 15 to 29 owns a smartphone, the impact of such misinformation on a generation is worrying, say observers. “Deepfakes began in 2016. Back then, it was a joke. But the technology has only gotten better. Earlier, there were photoshopped face swaps. Now there are lipsync fakes,” said Prof. Farid, warning that the tech has become more refined, raising the risk of harassment of women through the use of non-consensual sexual imagery.In Nov 2023, actress Rashmika Mandanna became a victim of a viral deepfake video that superimposed her face on to compromising content, sparking widespread outrage. “The very term ‘deepfake’ comes from a Reddit user who in the early days of this technology used it to create porn,” said Farid, calling the new term ‘Generative AI’ clever “rebranding” by the male-dominated tech industry.As AI evolves, India must strengthen legal frameworks, enhance digital literacy, and bring together minds across sectors to ensure safety, say experts. “We need to label everything as real or not real,” said Farid, “We need real disclosures.” To combat the deepening threat of deep fakes, TOI has already started armouring up. Watch out for our ‘Don’t Get Scammed’ stories to stay informed and aware. After all, as Farid puts it, “if you don’t know what’s real, how will you know what’s false”?","Ai-generated videos and audio clips don’t just distort reality.

More coverage on Cardi B and Stefon Diggs:

The placenta forms an extraordinary bond between mother and child, with the umbilical cord as their lifeline of silent conversation. When the baby arrives, the placenta follows, marking the end of this quiet connection. For nine months, mother and baby shared unspoken messages through this remarkable link, only to part with it at birth. But what if that connection could last a lifetime? That is probably the vision behind Mommy Made Encapsulation, a service that allows mothers to preserve their placenta forever. Such preservation was chosen by Cardi B , partner of New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs The couple recently welcomed a baby boy into their lives. Following the heartfelt tradition, she began with her third child, daughter Blossom, in October 2024, the Grammy-winning rapper chose to honor her fourth child with Diggs in November 2025 in a similar way. She entrusted Mommy Made Encapsulation to transform her pregnancy journey into cherished keepsakes, capturing the memorable moments when her baby was still growing inside her. The company crafted a heart-shaped gold pendant from the baby’s umbilical cord and turned the placenta into nourishing vitamins to support her post-partum recovery.Curious about how the gold pendant comes to life? The process begins with careful cleaning of the placenta, followed by a wash with blue dye that highlights its unique texture.After another rinse, the technician gently separates the placenta from the umbilical cord. The cord, now a striking blue, is shaped around a heart-shaped metal ring, with any extra length trimmed away. Finally, the piece is dipped in shimmering gold chrome, transforming it into a gleaming keepsake. The company describes it as a way to honor the first bond between mother and child. According to the company’s website, “The umbilical cord keepsake is your baby’s umbilical cord dehydrated in the shape of a heart and then dipped in gold chrome. The end result looks and feels like metal and is the perfect way to honor the first connection you shared with your baby.” It costs $50.The “AM I THE DRAMA?” creator took things a step further by having her placenta turned into vitamin capsules. That’s not all. She also tried something called a Placenta Print. The process starts with cleaning the placenta and dyeing it blue to look like a tree. Then, a sheet of paper is pressed on top to make the company’s signature Placenta Print, which costs $65. Their website explains that the print is made by painting the placenta with food-grade coloring (one gets to choose the colors) and stamping it onto a 12-by-18-inch poster to create a Tree of Life painting. After the print is made, the placenta receives a fresh rinse before its transformation into capsules begins.The website explains that the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) method is used, with careful steaming at 220 degrees F for 30 minutes to ensure safety. Bacteria and viruses cannot survive at temperatures higher than 131 degrees F. The placenta is gently steamed in specially designed steaming bags made up of heat-resistant, FDA-approved nylon, safe for cooking and free of BPA. Once steamed, the placenta is dried, ground into a fine powder, and sealed into capsules.Each placenta yields 160-180 pills, which, when taken regularly, can offer many benefits for new mothers, such as increased energy levels, reduced post-natal bleeding, lesser chance of baby blues, balanced mood and hormone levels, increased milk supply, lesser chance of post-partum depression, higher iron levels, uterus returning back to pre-pregnancy size faster, losing baby weight faster, and enhanced bonding experience with the baby. The capsules are available in a variety of flavors, including strawberry, orange, bubblegum, lime, berry, grape, and a vegan option. According to the website, these capsules never expire. They just need to be kept at room temperature and in a dry place. The pills can be taken with other medications. The cost of encapsulation starts at $500. This never-heard-before ritual has even captured the curiosity of stars like Megan Fox and Vanessa Hudgens , who, like Cardi B, have embraced the trend of creating placenta keepsakes.",The grammy-winning rapper entrusted mommy made encapsulation to transform her pregnancy journey into cherished keepsakes.

Stephen Curry's frustration with Under Armour's lack of vision

Stephen Curry had been with the sports apparel brand Under Armour for well over a decade. He joined as a brand ambassador in 2013 and was with them until recently, when their partnership ended earlier this month, in November 2025. While the sudden end to this business venture came out of nowhere, slowly, more information is coming to the forefront about what led to Curry's exit.And what might surprise many, is that one of the reasons that led to the end of this partnership was Caitlin Clark. Or more like Under Armour's indecisiveness in landing her as a brand ambassador. The Indiana Fever star was one of the prospects that the brand was looking to land, but they weren't invested enough in the deal, which led to a missed opportunity. And allegedly, Curry thought enough was enough, and decided that it was time his relationship with the brand ended. Stephen Curry , at the end of his partnership with Under Armour, was allegedly unhappy with how the brand was handling things. He had become ""frustrated by what they viewed as underinvestment,"" as well as the lack of sales, as they were not “meeting the company’s or Curry’s expectations."" With nothing seemingly working out, both parties decided to mutually end the partnership.And another nail in the coffin came in the form of their unsuccessful attempt to recruit Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark to join the brand last year. Both Curry and the company allegedly ""pursued the phenom, but Under Armour's offer trailed the total value of Nike's pitch."" Clark decided to drop out of the negotiations, and UA did not pursue the WNBA star further either.The Golden State Warriors star had also hoped that Under Armour's founder & CEO Kevin Plank ""would invest more in his line,” but that didn't work out either. But more business is not completely off the books for either party, as UA will “debut the final Curry shoe in February.” Currently, Curry is like prime real estate, and a lot of brands are looking to snatch him up before the opportunity closes on itself. The GSW star, though, is not in any hurry and is taking his time to decide which way he wants to go.Also Read: “Not your average GOAT” – Stephen Curry unveils new poster of his highly anticipated movie with Ayesha Curry","Stephen curry had been with the sports apparel brand under armour for well over a decade.

Common mistakes when restoring old photos with Google Nano Banana Pro

There is something magical about rediscovering an old, worn photograph. The soft yellows, the creases, the fading edges and the stubborn scratches hold stories that feel too precious to lose. Until recently, restoring these photos required hours of painstaking manual editing. Now Google Nano Banana Pro has made that process far easier. With the right prompts and a bit of creative direction, you can revive portraits, repair damage, and bring lost details back to life in a way that looks natural and polished. Whether you are working with a family album or a treasured vintage snapshot, this tool gives you professional level results with far less effort.Google Nano Banana Pro uses advanced diffusion modelling and context-aware reconstruction. In simple terms, it analyses each pixel, predicts missing details and rebuilds textures so the restored image looks authentic rather than overly sharpened. It also understands lighting, skin tones, shadows and colour balance, which makes it one of the most reliable tools for repairing vintage portraits. Instead of plastic-looking edits, you get subtle, human-like restoration that respects the original photo.The model also handles very damaged images. Torn edges, fold marks, grainy patches and faded backgrounds can be reconstructed automatically. For photos from the 70s and 80s, which often have tinted colour casts, the tool balances hues without making the image look artificial.Using this model effectively comes down to guiding it with clear prompts. Here are prompt structures that work well for damaged or faded photos:“Restore this old photograph with natural colours, clean details and accurate lighting. Remove scratches, stains and noise while keeping the original style.”“Reconstruct the face gently, retain natural skin texture, preserve original expressions and repair damaged areas without over-smoothing.”“Neutralise yellow tint, improve contrast, balance highlights and shadows, and restore film-like tones.”“Rebuild missing or torn sections, reconstruct textures, recover facial features accurately and maintain the vintage feel of the image.”You can also add extra artistic instructions such as “keep grain minimal” or “retain film quality”. The more specific you are, the more consistent the results.To ensure your restored photos look natural, keep these expert guidelines in mind:It is tempting to eliminate all grain, but older photographs naturally have texture. Leave a little grain to maintain the vintage character.For very old family photographs, match the restored colours with reference images from that era. For example, mid-century colour palettes often used softer reds and muted greens.Shadows anchor a photograph. If you remove too many shadows or highlights, the restored image may look flat. Let the model repair damage, but keep the original lighting structure intact.While the model handles most reconstruction automatically, sometimes background objects can appear too clean. Adjusting the prompt to “preserve background imperfections” can solve this.Many beginners make the error of giving vague prompts like “fix this photo”. This causes incorrect smoothing, unnatural facial features or oddly bright colours. Another mistake is using portrait prompts for landscape images, which can distort objects. Over-sharpening is also common, resulting in a digital rather than vintage look. Always compare the original and restored versions side by side to ensure the emotional tone remains the same.Photo restoration is more than fixing pixels. It is a way of honouring memories that might otherwise fade. With Google Nano Banana Pro and the right prompt strategy, you can bring old pictures back to life while preserving their history and charm. A few careful edits and a well-structured prompt are often all it takes to rebuild details, refresh colours and revive treasured moments.

Nvidia’s historic milestone



JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon doesn’t sugarcoat AI impact on jobs





JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has now hailed Nvidia as an unbelievable company and has also cautioned investors that some artificial intelligence stocks may be trading at an unsustainable levels. Speaking with CNN’s Erin Burnett, Dimon said that the US remains the ‘most prosperous’ economy in the world. He adds that the US economy is supported by diverse and deep capital markets including venture capital, private credit and hedge funds. “There’s no question some people will lose money,” Dimon said, drawing parallels to the dot-com era. “But mankind should benefit,” he added, emphasising that the underlying technology is real and transformative—even if valuations are currently inflated.Dimon emphasized that AI is a genuine productivity revolution, comparing its current stage to the early days of the Internet. “It’s almost at the beginning,” he said, noting that while not every company will succeed, AI will produce transformative winners just as the internet gave rise to Google, Facebook, and Amazon.Dimon acknowledged that valuations in the AI sector may be inflated, but stressed that the underlying technology will reshape industries and improve lives.“Mankind should benefit,” he said, even if “valuations today may be too high for some of these folks.”In October 2025, Nvidia became the first company in history to surpass a $5 trillion market valuation. Its market cap currently stands at $4.74 trillion, underscoring its dominance in the AI chip market. Dimon’s remarks came shortly after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicted that China will win the AI race, a claim that drew sharp pushback from President Donald Trump, who vowed the U.S. would not allow other nations access to Nvidia’s most advanced chips.In another interview with Bloomberg TV, Dimon talked about the impact of AI on the job market. “People shouldn’t put their head in the sand. It is going to affect jobs,” he said. “AI will enhance some aspects of work, but also eliminate some jobs.” However, Dimon also stressed on the fact that JPMorgan is focused on retaining and redeploying employees whose roles are impacted by automation. “We’ll have more jobs, but there’ll probably be less jobs in certain functions,” Dimon added. “You’re better off being way ahead of the curve,” Dimon added.Dimon also added that the bank has invested about $2 billion as an annual investment in AI and is already making $2 billion in direct benefits. This includes the headcount reductions and operational savings. “We know about $2 billion of actual cost saves,” he said. “It’s the tip of the iceberg.”","Jpmorgan chase ceo jamie dimon has hailed nvidia as an unbelievable company.

Warren Buffett’s $4.3 billion Alphabet investment signals a direct challenge to Nvidia’s lead in AI chips,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/warren-buffetts-4-3-billion-alphabet-investment-signals-a-direct-challenge-to-nvidias-lead-in-ai-chips/articleshow/125506567.cms,"Google’s AI chips may be shifting the balance of power

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

A shifting competitive dynamic, but not a dethroning

Google trains and serves Gemini models on TPU infrastructure.

Google Cloud is offering Ironwood TPUs to customers as part of its cloud platform.

Companies such as Anthropic have announced plans to use up to one million Google TPUs, citing performance and cost considerations.

What Buffett’s investment likely signals

Implications for the AI chip race





When Berkshire Hathaway revealed a new multibillion-dollar stake in Alphabet, most observers initially viewed it as another major addition to Warren Buffett’s long-term portfolio. Yet the timing and strategic context suggest the investment could be more than a routine allocation. The world’s most influential value investor has chosen to back Alphabet at a moment when the company is strengthening its control over the hardware that underpins advanced AI systems.For nearly a decade, Alphabet has been developing its own artificial intelligence chips, known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). In November 2025, the company announced general availability of its seventh-generation Ironwood TPU, describing it as designed for demanding AI workloads, including large-scale model training and high-volume inference. This announcement was made publicly on Google Cloud’s official blog, where the company highlighted lower costs and improved performance for AI developers.Most AI labs still rely heavily on Nvidia’s high-performance GPUs.These GPUs remain the industry’s gold standard, but they are extremely expensive and often in short supply. This has created bottlenecks for AI companies that depend entirely on Nvidia for compute capacity.Google is in a unique position. By designing its own chips, running its own data centres and integrating its hardware into products such as Gemini and Google Cloud, Alphabet gains levels of efficiency that many competitors cannot match without years of hardware investment. Analysts and industry researchers have suggested that TPU-based training may offer meaningful cost advantages compared to traditional GPU-heavy infrastructure, although exact ratios vary and are not always publicly disclosed.Buffett’s investment therefore can be understood not as a claim that Alphabet has overtaken Nvidia, but as confidence in Alphabet’s vertically integrated approach to AI. By controlling more of the stack, Alphabet potentially insulates itself from the price swings, supply constraints and dependence that characterise the GPU market.Nvidia remains the clear leader in AI chips and maintains a robust ecosystem of developers, tools and software support. Google’s TPUs represent a serious alternative in some workloads, but not a full replacement for GPUs across all use cases.The publicly available evidence shows:These developments suggest that the AI compute market may become more competitive. However, they do not confirm that Nvidia’s dominance is definitively weakened. Instead, they indicate that Alphabet is emerging as a strong hardware contender in a market previously dominated by a single supplier.Berkshire Hathaway’s disclosed stake in Alphabet was valued at approximately US$4.3 billion at the time of the filing. The filing does not state Berkshire’s motives. However, investors and analysts widely agree that Buffett’s approval of such a large position indicates confidence in Alphabet’s long-term strategy, including its growing emphasis on efficient AI infrastructure.Buffett has consistently favoured companies with durable advantages or “moats.” Alphabet’s traditional moats have included Search, YouTube and Android. In the AI era, Google’s control over its own chip design and cloud hardware may represent an additional moat that differentiates it from rivals.This does not imply that Google is attempting to dismantle Nvidia’s leadership. Instead, it suggests that Alphabet is building the capability to operate more independently in an AI-driven future, and that this capability may strengthen its competitiveness in cloud computing and AI services.The next phase of AI is likely to be shaped by which companies can train and deploy models most efficiently. If Google Cloud attracts more third-party training due to cost, performance and availability, it could gradually shift cloud market dynamics. Nvidia will remain central to the ecosystem, but Google’s TPU ecosystem adds a new dimension to the competition.Buffett’s investment amplifies the narrative that companies with deeper control over hardware, software and data will hold significant advantages in the years ahead. Alphabet is signalling that it intends to be such a company.The takeaway is clear: this is not the end of Nvidia’s dominance, but it may be the beginning of a more competitive era in AI hardware.",Berkshire hathaway revealed a new multibillion-dollar stake in alphabet.

"Apple CEO Tim Cook may not be retiring soon, here’s why",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-ceo-tim-cook-may-not-be-retiring-soon-heres-why/articleshow/125533511.cms,"Apple CEO Tim Cook Confirms Majority Of iPhones Sold In U.S. Now Made In India

Tim Cook to reportedly retire in 2026

Tim Cook’s continued leadership

What’s next for Apple’s executive team





Apple CEO Tim Cook may not be retiring anytime soon. Earlier this month, a report by Financial Times revealed that Tim Cook is planning to step down as soon as next year. However, a new report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman suggests that Cook has no plans of stepping down in the near future. Apple has been preparing for a leadership transition for quite some time. In 2024, Bloomberg revealed that Apple’s senior vice president of hardware engineering John Ternus was at the center of succession discussions. Ternus the youngest member of Apple’s executive team looks after the hardware division and is also widely respected by Apple CEO Tim Cook and former COO Jeff Williams.Then in October this year, Bloomberg suggests that the internal spotlight on Ternus was ‘intensifying’, making him the likely candidate to succeed Cook.Earlier this month, a report by Financial Times revealed that Apple CEO Tim Cook may step down from his position in between January and June 2026. As per the report, the current CEO Tim Cook is said to be succeeded by John Ternus, Apple’s senior vice-president of hardware engineering. However, no final decision has been made, sources told the publication. They also stressed that the transition plans are not tied to Apple’s current performance, as the company heads into what is expected to be a strong holiday season for iPhone sales.Taking about this upcoming transition, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman wrote, “Based on everything I’ve learned in recent weeks, I don’t believe a departure by the middle of next year is likely.” This means there are less chances of Tim Cook retiring anytime soon.Cook, who turned 65 this month, took over as CEO in 2011 after co-founder Steve Jobs died. Under his leadership, Apple’s valuation has climbed from around $350 billion to $4 trillion. Despite strong results last month, Apple’s roughly 12% stock rise this year trails rivals like Alphabet, Nvidia and Microsoft, which have surged on AI momentum.“Yes, Apple will eventually have a new leader. And, yes, it’s probably Ternus. But unless there is some unexpected event that forces Cook to step down sooner than planned, that moment is not at hand. But there still may be significant movement on Apple’s executive team. As I recently reported, silicon chief Johny Srouji is seriously evaluating his future at the company, while Apple has been on the hunt for a new AI leader,” said Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.While the retirement of Apple CEO Tim Cook is not imminent, Bloomberg reveals that the company will still witness some leadership changes in the coming weeks. As per the report,Apple’s silicon chief, Johny Srouji may be evaluating his future at the company. Also, Apple is actively looking for a new AI leader in order to strengthen its position in generative AI sector.","Earlier this month, a report by financial times revealed that tim cook is planning to step down as soon as next year.

Moody's warns that many US States showing recession signs





Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again issued one of his starkest warnings yet about the global economy. Bezos has urged the consumers and businesses to postpone their large purchases as the fear of recession is mounting. Speaking to CNN’s Chole Melas in an interview, Bezos has cautioned that the coming months could bring prolonged downturn. Bezos has recommend that households should consider putting a hold on purchasing big-ticket products such as cars, televisions and appliances. He urge the consumers to save that money as it will make a lot of difference if the economic worsens. Along with this, Bezos has also advised the small businesses to avoid large capital expenditures or acquisitions during this uncertain period.“Take some risk off the table,” Bezos said. “Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference.”Despite his cautionary advice, Bezos struck an optimistic tone about the long-term future, saying he believes the American Dream remains attainable. He even projected that within his lifetime, space travel could become broadly accessible to the public. Last month, Bezos tweeted a warning to “batten down the hatches,” advice he reiterated in his CNN interview as relevant to both consumers and business owners.Ironically, if the consumers follow Bezos’ advice, then it could mean lower sales for Amazon. Recently, Amazon announced its plans to layoff 14,000 employees. In October, Amazon projected holiday-quarter sales below Wall Street expectations, citing inflation and shifting consumer behavior. Americans are spending more on travel and dining out and less on discretionary goods.Recently, Mark Zandi, chief economist at credit rating agency Moody' warned about recession in the US. A new analysis of state-level data suggests that the US economy is ""on the edge of recession,"" said Mark Zandi of Moody's. ""Based on my assessment of various data, states making up nearly a third of US GDP are either in or at high risk of recession, another third are just holding steady, and the remaining third are growing,"" Zandi wrote on social media.The data reveals a mixed picture across the country. States in the South are generally the strongest, though their growth is beginning to slow. Meanwhile, some of the nation's largest economies, like California and New York, are described as ""holding their own,"" and their stability is seen as critical to preventing a full-blown national recession.However, many states are showing signs of vulnerability. Wyoming, Montana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Kansas, and Massachusetts were all identified as being at high risk of recession. The broader Washington, D.C. area is also notable for its economic struggles, which Zandi attributes to government job cuts.Adding to the forecast, Zandi predicts that the annual inflation rate, currently at 2.7%, could rise to nearly 4% within the next year, further eroding purchasing power for consumers.Along with this, Zandi also warned about the restrictive immigration policies which could hurt the tech sector. He urged the lawmakers to protect access to global talent especially in AI, software engineering, and data science. ""If it feels like we're coming to the end of the tariff increases, or like we're going to get a more rational immigration policy,' I think that would be a signal that the coast may be cleared,"" Zandi told BI.“It’s no mystery why the economy is struggling; blame increasing U.S. tariffs and highly restrictive immigration policy. The tariffs are cutting increasingly deeply into the profits of American companies and the purchasing power of American households. Fewer immigrant workers means a smaller economy,” added Zandi.","Bezos has urged the consumers and businesses to postpone their large purchases as the fear of recession is mounting.

In a recent internal memo to colleagues, Altman acknowledged that the AI startup rival's success couldHowever, Altman reassured that OpenAI isand anticipates emerging as the leader in the AI race. It's important to note that Altman's memo was written before Google's Gemini 3 was released, a model the tech giant has described as its most capable to date. Software developers have reported that the new model performed well on tasks such as automating website and product design and writing code, which is a lucrative revenue stream for OpenAI and its competitors, such as Anthropic.Concerns about OpenAI's slowing growth arose late this summer. During a recent quarterly earnings call with investors, the company’s CFO, Sarah Friar, confirmed that user engagement with the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT had cooled, despite the company's otherwise positive financial results.According to a report by The Information (as seen by The Economic Times), Sam Altman's memo noted that competitors such as Google and Anthropic are narrowing the gap in the AI raceAnthropic’s Claude model generates computer code for various tasks using conversational prompts.Meanwhile, Google has been integrating its Gemini AI chatbot into its search app, productivity tools and other services. However, recently, Claude gained a new challenger from OpenAI with the introduction of Codex.Google also holds an economic advantage. OpenAI’s growth has been rapid and the company now carries a valuation of around $500 billion as a for-profit entity. It is expected to bring in about $13 billion in revenue, but is estimated to burn roughly $100 billion in its push toward superintelligence.With a market value of about $3.5 trillion, Google reported free cash flow of over $70 billion in the past four quarters. A significant portion of this comes from providing cloud services to OpenAI, Anthropic and other competitors.Sam Altman also encouraged OpenAI employees to stay confident and focus on the company's larger goals.Altman wrote in the internal memo.Altman added.Recently, OpenAI partnered with Apple's biggest suuplier Foxconn to design and build AI data-centre components in the US.

Residency program





Saudi Arabia has taken a cautious step in loosening its long-standing restrictions on alcohol, allowing non-Muslim residents under the country’s special residency program to purchase alcohol from Riyadh stores that were previously reserved for diplomats. The move is part of the kingdom’s broader effort to boost tourism and diversify its economy under Vision 2030.According to Semafor, the Saudi government has quietly expanded access, permitting non-Muslim holders of the premium residency program to buy alcohol from the Riyadh store, which until now catered exclusively to foreign diplomats. The government has not issued an official announcement; the change became known as residents discovered it while attempting to purchase alcohol.This initiative aligns with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 plan, which aims to attract 150 million visitors annually and reduce reliance on oil revenues. The Riyadh liquor store, opened last year, centralized alcohol distribution in the kingdom, which previously relied on diplomatic shipments.Launched in 2019, the premium residency program targets high-earning expatriates and skilled foreign workers. By allowing this group to buy alcohol, the government signals openness to expatriates while maintaining strict overall control over alcohol sales. Eligibility for the program has expanded over time and now includes expatriates earning more than 80,000 riyals ($21,000) per month or those employed in certain professions.Historically, alcohol has been strictly prohibited in Saudi Arabia, though some hotels offer mocktails and non-alcoholic beer. Businesses are prepared to adapt to the new regulations, but the government is proceeding cautiously.","Expats in saudi arabia can now quietly buy alcohol in riyadh, signaling cautious policy change.
