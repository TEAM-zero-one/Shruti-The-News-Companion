On Jan 29, India witnessed Isro's 100th rocket launch when GSLV-F15 rocket launched navigation satellite NVS-02. He urged people to observe National Science Day by spending “One Day as a Scientist”, which he said will foster curiosity among children and youth about science.On the country’s space sector achievements, Modi said, “Champions Trophy is going on these days and there is an atmosphere of cricket for everyone. We all know the thrill of a century in cricket. But today, I am not going to talk about cricket, rather I will talk about the wonderful century that India has made in space. Last month, the country was a witness to Isro's 100th rocket launch. This is not just a number, but it shows our resolve to achieve ever-new heights in space science. Our space journey started in a very normal manner. There were challenges in every step, but our scientists continued moving forward achieving victory over them.”“With time, the list of our achievements in space flights continues to grow longer. Be it building a launch vehicle, success of Chandrayaan, Mangalyaan and Aditya L1 or carrying out the unprecedented mission of sending 104 satellites into space in one go with one rocket. The ambit of Isro's success has been quite large. In the past 10 years, around 460 satellites have been launched, in which many satellites of other countries are also included,"" the PM said.On growing women’s power in the industry, Modi said, “The participation of women power has been continuously rising in the space sector. I feel very happy seeing that today the space sector has become a favourite of the youth. For our youth who want to do something thrilling and exciting in their life, the space sector is becoming an excellent option for them.""Speaking about National Science Day 2025, which will be celebrated on Feb 28, the PM said that the interest and passion of youth in science matters a lot. ""You try to spend one day as a scientist. You must visit places like a research lab, planetarium or space centre that day. This will increase your curiosity about science. Like space and science, India is rapidly making its mark in another field. That is AI (Artificial intelligence). I went to Paris to take part in an AI summit. There, people lauded India's strides in the field of AI,"" PM Modi said.He also mentioned a teacher from Telangana, Thodasam Kailash, who is harnessing AI technology in digital song and music to help preserve the tribal languages, including Kolami. His tracks are being liked a lot by the tribal people. ""People of India are second to none in adopting and using new technologies,"" he said.","Pm narendra modi hailed isro, saying it has hit the century in space.

It is unacceptable. No fraternizing.

“Our first date was very undercover,” disclosed SI model Camille Kostek about her date with New England Patriots TE Rob Gronkowski

The New York Post

“Our first date was very undercover because I was a cheerleader for the New England Patriots and you’re not allowed to date the players. But I was a bad girl, we went to the movies at Patriot Place in the lux level and we went with our hoodies up.”

“We read our calendars to each other,” Camille Kostek uncovered the secret of long-lasting love before marriage when you’re dating

FOX News Digital

“We read our calendars to each other. We don’t spend every waking moment together, so it’s exciting for us to get on the phone. It’s a common thing weekly to get on the phone together when we are in different states and put out our calendars.

It’s exciting when we line up our schedules. We have our press week, then we squeeze in a dinner together or even just a bagel together on a park bench and make it a romantic movie, even if it’s 30 minutes. But I think that’s what keeps it alive. We both are just so supportive of each other, and whether we are far or together.

Ashneer Grover-led fantasy cricket platform CrickPe has shut down operations just two years after its launch, according to an Inc42 report. The platform, which was the first product from Grover’s startup Third Unicorn , was introduced ahead of the 2023 Indian Premier League (IPL) season. However, it has now stopped launching new contests.A message on the CrickPe app reads, “We’ve had an amazing innings together. While we won’t be rolling out new contests on the app anymore, this is just a timeout.”Speaking to the publication, Grover confirmed the decision to halt CrickPe at the end of 2024, citing the regulatory environment and taxation issues. He said:“CrickPe has been halted end 2024 as we are not keen on the space given misplaced connotation of gambling with gaming in India and imposition of 28% GST last year. We had great fun with the space but feel it’s best for incumbents like Dream11 and others and the economics of the business does not have scope for incentivising the cricketers out of the game pot – which was our initial idea.”A major challenge for CrickPe was the 28% GST levied on online real-money gaming. The new tax regime, implemented on October 1, 2023, replaced the earlier 18% GST on platform fees for skill-based games.Grover has been a vocal critic of this move. He once posted on X (formerly known as Twitter) that the 28% GST had ""murdered the online gaming industry”. The post was later deleted.While the Supreme Court recently put a temporary hold on GST proceedings against 49 real-money gaming companies, the uncertainty surrounding taxation and regulations appears to have played a role in decision to halt CrickPe.Despite ceasing new contests, CrickPe still allows users to withdraw their winnings.",28% gst on online real-money gaming one of the reasons behind shutdown of crickpe.

Mercedes Unveils 2025 F1 Car, Embarks on New Era Without Lewis Hamilton



Mercedes-AMG Petronas Formula 1 Team has revealed its highly anticipated 2025 F1 car, the W16, marking the start of a new chapter following Lewis Hamilton's move to Ferrari. The British-based team launched the W16 digitally, just days after showcasing its striking livery at Formula One's grand season launch in London. This new era introduces rookie Kimi Antonelli, who will partner with George Russell , as Mercedes aims to reclaim its dominance on the grid.With Hamilton’s departure, the responsibility of leading Mercedes now falls on George Russell, who is ready to compete for the drivers' championship. Team Principal Toto Wolff expressed confidence, stating, “George has proven that he is one of the very best drivers on the grid, capable of competing for the drivers' championship if we can give him a car capable of doing so.” The team’s optimism is further fueled by the debut of 18-year-old Italian sensation Kimi Antonelli, the youngest driver to race for Mercedes, who was fast-tracked through its junior program. Antonelli expressed his gratitude, saying, “It is a great opportunity, and I am very thankful to everyone at Mercedes for the faith and trust they've placed in me.” Valtteri Bottas, who previously raced for Mercedes, will serve as the reserve driver, bringing valuable experience to the team.The W16 has been designed with substantial changes aimed at addressing the performance inconsistencies seen in its predecessor, the W15. Mercedes' technical director, James Allison, explained that the team’s primary focus was on eliminating the car's reluctance to turn in slow corners and balancing tyre temperatures to enhance consistency. “Our primary focus has been on dialling out the W15’s slight reluctance to turn in slow corners, along with the imbalance in tyre temperatures that made the car inconsistent from session to session,” Allison stated. The team has redesigned every aerodynamic surface and introduced a new front suspension for 2025, showcasing their commitment to competitive advancement.Also Read: Max Verstappen considers boycotting future F1 launches after facing 'Unacceptable' booing from London fans As Mercedes embarks on this new era, anticipation is high for the upcoming season.

In a rare moment of vulnerability, Warren Buffett confessed to making mistakes at Berkshire Hathaway in his annual shareholder letter , comparing the emotional toll of some errors to ""the pain of a failed marriage.""Acknowledging his missteps in capital allocation and hiring decisions, Buffett emphasized that the real problem lies in failing to correct mistakes promptly. His candid approach stands in stark contrast to the polished narratives often offered by corporate leaders, reinforcing his reputation for transparency and accountability.In his annual shareholder letter, renowned investor and Berkshire Hathaway chairman Warren Buffett openly admitted to making mistakes at the company, emphasizing that errors should not be seen as taboo. Over the course of the 15-page letter, Buffett used the word ""mistake"" 13 times, underscoring the idea that the real issue isn't making mistakes but failing to address them quickly.“Mistakes—yes, we make them at Berkshire,” Buffett wrote, further stressing that the key mistake is delaying correction, a concept his business partner, Charlie Munger, called ""thumb-sucking."" Munger’s perspective was clear: problems cannot be ignored; they require immediate action, even if it’s uncomfortable.Buffett confessed to misjudging the future prospects of some businesses Berkshire had acquired, admitting that these were ""cases of capital allocation gone wrong.""

Potential

spillover risk

Monitoring and

pandemic preparedness

A new bat coronavirus with the potential for animal-to-human transmission has been discovered by a team of Chinese researchers, raising concerns about possible future spillover events. The virus, named HKU5-CoV-2 , was found to use the same human receptor as SARS-CoV-2 , the virus responsible for Covid-19.According to the South China Morning Post, the study was led by Shi Zhengli , a renowned virologist known as ""batwoman"" due to her extensive research on bat coronaviruses.The research involved scientists from the Guangzhou Laboratory, Guangzhou Academy of Sciences, Wuhan University, and the Wuhan Institute of Virology . Their findings were published in the peer-reviewed journal Cell on Tuesday.The newly discovered virus belongs to the merbecovirus subgenus, which includes the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus. It is a new lineage of the HKU5 coronavirus, initially identified in Japanese pipistrelle bats in Hong Kong.The research found that HKU5-CoV-2 can bind to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor, the same receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to infect human cells. ""We report the discovery and isolation of a distinct lineage (lineage 2) of HKU5-CoV, which can utilise not only bat ACE2 but also human ACE2 and various mammalian ACE2 orthologs,"" the scientists wrote.The study warned that bat merbecoviruses ""pose a high risk of spillover to humans, either through direct transmission or facilitated by intermediate hosts.""According to the researchers, HKU5-CoV-2 can bind to ACE2 receptors in multiple animal species, increasing the likelihood of interspecies transmission.Despite its potential for human infection, the researchers cautioned against exaggerating the threat. They noted that the virus’s efficiency in binding to human ACE2 is “significantly lower” than that of SARS-CoV-2. ""The risk of [HKU5-CoV-2] emergence in human populations should not be exaggerated,"" they said.Earlier this month, Cell published a study by researchers from the University of Washington in Seattle and Wuhan University, which concluded that while the HKU5 strain could bind to bat and other mammalian ACE2 receptors, it did not show ""efficient"" binding to human ACE2.However, Shi’s team countered that HKU5-CoV-2 appears to be better adapted to human receptors than its predecessor, lineage 1, and ""may have a broader host range and a higher potential for interspecies infection,"" South China Morning Post reported.Given the potential risks, the researchers focused on the need for further monitoring. The World Health Organization has already included merbecoviruses on its list of emerging pathogens for pandemic preparedness.Shi Zhengli, who played a key role in Covid-19 research, has previously denied claims that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was responsible for the pandemic.While the origins of Covid-19 remain debated, some studies suggest the virus originated in bats and jumped to humans through an intermediate host.","A new bat coronavirus with the potential for animal-to-human transmission has been discovered by a team of chinese researchers.

Row over American Riviera and As Ever



As Meghan Markle is launching her product line under a new name As Ever, reports claimed that in October 2022, a Chinese clothing company named ASEVER objected to Meghan's brand. A Daily Mail report claimed that at that time, Meghan was planning to sell aprons and other items of clothing and also her jams and dog biscuits. However, she was barred from selling any clothing item because of the lawsuit from the Chinese brand.ASEVER is a Shenzhen-based company which supplies stores like H&M. Meghan's lawyers filed a revised application for a trademark and removed any mention of clothing and it was approved.This past lawsuit will have no bearing on her present company but she will never be able to sell anything related to clothes and her haters are wondering loud on social media if she can make anything unique.Meghan originally named her brand American Riviera but it was not allowed as it is a geographical location where she lives. The name was rejected as one can't have a patent on a location. Meghan said the name would have limited her products to the area and hence she decided on a new name.One clothing company with the same name 'As Ever' put out a statement that they have been in existence in New York since 2017 but they never applied to trademark the name. ""I'm a very small business. It's a family-run operation. I'm essentially a one-man brand. This new venture has the power and money of Netflix behind it,"" Mark said.At the same time, the mayor of a Spanish village claimed that Megha literally just lifted the village's logo of a palm tree and two hummingbirds and made it the logo of her brand changing the color.

"Trump's tariffs: India’s GDP may take 0.1-0.6% hit from US tariff moves, says Goldman Sachs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/trumps-tariffs-indias-gdp-may-take-0-1-0-6-hit-from-us-tariff-moves-says-goldman-sachs/articleshow/118523127.cms,"Trump has specifically mentioned India alongside the European Union and China, stating that India maintained ""the highest tariffs in the world"".

India-US Trade Dynamics:

India's two-way goods trade surplus with the US has seen a twofold increase in the past decade, rising from $17bn (0.9% of India's GDP) in FY14 (fiscal year runs from April to March) to $35bn (1.0% of GDP) in FY24.

The surge is primarily attributed to heightened trade surplus in electronic items, following the implementation of fiscal incentives through the PLI scheme in 2020.

India's Goods Trade Surplus with the US

The tariff structure shows India maintaining higher rates compared to the US across most product categories, with notable differences observed in agricultural products, textiles, and pharmaceutical products.

Weighted Average Effective US Tariff

Goldman Sachs outlines three potential implementation approaches for the ""reciprocal tariff"" scheme:

1. Country-level reciprocity:

2. Product-level reciprocity:

3. Reciprocity including non-tariff barriers:

India's gross exports to the US

The analysis considers various scenarios, incorporating different levels of US tariff increases on Indian imports and utilising elasticity estimates from existing research. The calculations suggest that these tariff adjustments could reduce India's GDP growth by 0.1-0.3 percentage points across different scenarios.

According to Goldman Sachs, when India's gross exports to the US amount to approximately 2% of GDP, and considering an 11.5 percentage point rise in average US effective tariff rates on Indian imports with a price elasticity estimate of -0.5, the resultant GDP impact would be 0.12 percentage points (2%*11.5*-0.5=-0.12pp).

Potential impact on GDP

In the scenario where the US implements a universal reciprocal tariff across all nations, the appropriate indicator for evaluating a domestic economy's US exposure would be the domestic value added content in gross exports to US final demand, as per the OECD's Trade in Value-Added Database.

This indicator precisely measures a country's domestic activity exposure to the US. With India's domestic value added content in gross exports at approximately 4.0% of GDP, it positions itself centrally amongst its Asian counterparts. Using this measurement, the potential impact on domestic GDP growth, considering a 6.5-11.5 percentage point increase in US average effective tariff rates, would likely fall between 0.1 and 0.6 percentage points.

India in middle of spectrum

Impact of US tariffs on India: India’s GDP may take a hit of around 0.1 to 0.6 percentage points due to the proposed US tariffs, according to a recent Goldman Sachs analysis. The study examines scenarios of US tariff implementation: country-level and product-level reciprocity.It states, ""India's domestic activity exposure to US final demand would be roughly twice as high (4.0 per cent of GDP) given exposure to the US via exports to other countries, and would likely result in a potential domestic GDP growth impact of 0.1-0.6pp.""Should the US administration opt to raise tariffs on all imports by the average tariff differential between specific countries and itself, the effective US tariff rates on Indian imports would see an increase of 6.5 percentage points, it says.On February 13, President Trump directed his team to create a ""Fair and Reciprocal Plan"". The subsequent memo outlined a strategy to equalise tariffs, taxes and non-tariff barriers with other nations. During his February 13 press conference, Trump specifically mentioned India alongside the European Union and China, stating that India maintained ""the highest tariffs in the world"".Also Read | 'More of white noise': Why Trump’s reciprocal tariffs on India’s exports to US will have a ‘limited’ impact The first approach involves country-level reciprocity, where the US administration could raise tariffs on all imports by the average tariff difference between a specific country and the US. This would result in approximately 6.5 percentage points increase in US effective tariff rates on Indian imports. The US economics team suggests this as the most straightforward implementation method, allowing officials to apply a single uniform rate per country on existing tariff rates.The second method focuses on product-level reciprocity, where the US administration would equalise tariff rates on individual products with those imposed by trading partners. This could lead to roughly 11.5 percentage points increase in US effective tariff rates on Indian imports. This approach requires more complex administration and longer implementation periods. A White House memo dated February 13 requires the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) to provide a report to the President within 180 days.The third approach encompasses reciprocity including non-tariff barriers, such as administrative obstacles, import licensing requirements, and export subsidies. This represents the most complex implementation method due to difficulties in calculating non-tariff barrier costs for each trading partner. Consequently, the analysis focuses solely on tariff-related barriers.Goldman Sachs’ assessment of India's vulnerability to US tariff changes begins with examining export exposure. India's exports to the US accounted for approximately 2.0% of its GDP in 2023, representing one of the smallest exposures amongst emerging market economies.Also Read | Tesla India entry: Why Donald Trump has said it would be ‘very unfair’ for Elon Musk’s Tesla to set up a factory in India The key factor in determining the economic impact lies in understanding how responsive Indian exports are to US tariff adjustments, specifically focusing on the price elasticity of American demand for Indian goods.","India's two-way goods trade surplus with the us has seen a twofold increase in the past decade.
