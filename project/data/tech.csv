NEW DELHI: Expressing serious concern over the deleterious impact of addictive betting applications on youth, the Supreme Court on Friday asked the Centre to respond in two weeks what steps it is contemplating to save youngsters from getting financially ruined, often forcing them to commit suicide.A bench of Justices Surya Kant and Joymalya Bagchi asked the counsel for Centre to specify in its affidavit ""what remedial measures it is contemplating after applying mind to the gravity of the issue"".The counsel said another bench is examining whether these apps are akin to gambling, requiring them to be banned, and the decision in that case would have a direct bearing on reliefs sought in a PIL filed by K A Paul. But the bench said, ""You (the Centre) do not appear to take the problem seriously"".The judges also issued notices to some states, RBI, ED, TRAI, Google India, Apple India, Dream11 and other gaming companies to file responses in two weeks.The petitioner had sought a complete ban on illegal betting apps and strict regulation of online gaming and fantasy sports, alleging these are being popularised by film stars, famous cricketers and other celebrities and end up drawing youth to the apps like moths to a flame. He said the more than 150-year-old Public Gambling Act, 1867, is unable to deal with the menace.Over 24 incidents of suicide have been reported from Telangana alone in the last one and a half years and are directly linked to debt traps created by gambling/betting platforms.","Justices surya kant and joymalya bagchi asked the counsel for centre to specify in its affidavit ""what remedial measures it is contemplating"" the judges also issued notices to some states, rbi, ed, trai, google india, apple india, dream11 and other gaming companies.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123051761,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-42646,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

SEBI Unveils ‘Valid’ UPI System to Protect Investors from Fraud in Capital Markets Starting Oct 1

UPI New Rules 2025: Top Things to Know

Cap on balance enquiries to prevent system overload

Limit on bank account access via “list account” API

Restrictions on UPI autopay transactions during peak hours

Industry reaction welcomes move towards efficiency

Deadline set for compliance; penalties for violations

Starting August 1, 2025, UPI will see changes as the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has rolled out new performance-centric guidelines for the UPI ecosystem.The changes are aimed at improving system efficiency, preventing outages, and ensuring better user consent mechanisms.Payment Service Providers (PSPs), UPI apps, and banks must implement the changes by July 31, as per NPCI’s compliance notice dated May 21.A major change includes a cap on balance enquiry requests, now limited to 50 per app per customer in a rolling 24-hour period, as per ET.These requests must be user-initiated only, with no automatic prompts by apps or systems. UPI apps must also introduce the ability to reduce or halt such requests during peak load hours to minimise system strain.The guidelines also require issuer banks to include the available account balance in every successful UPI transaction message, streamlining user experience and reducing the need for separate balance checks.NPCI has also put in place access limits on the “list account” API, which lets users view bank accounts linked to their mobile number. This API will now be restricted to 25 requests per customer per app per day, and only after the user selects their bank in the app.Any retries must be made with explicit customer consent, ensuring transparency and avoiding unnecessary API calls.To further address system congestion, NPCI has restricted UPI Autopay executions to non-peak hours only. Peak hours are defined as 10:00 to 13:00 and 17:00 to 21:30.Each autopay mandate will be allowed one initial attempt and a maximum of three retries, clearly capped at four total executions per mandate sequence.Welcoming the new rules, Tarun Nazare, co-founder and managing director of Neokred was quoted as saying by ET that “These measures are prudent and forward-thinking, as they prioritise system efficiency and user security. By capping balance requests and optimising API usage—especially with clear restrictions during peak hours—the guidelines will effectively reduce server overloads and potential service outages. ”He also highlighted the value of “emphasis on customer consent and timely compliance” in enhancing system accountability.The NPCI has clearly warned that failure to comply with these directives by July 31, 2025, may result in UPI API restrictions, penalties, suspension of new customer onboarding, or any other appropriate action.NPCI has advised all member banks and UPI ecosystem participants to communicate these changes across their systems and partners ahead of the compliance deadline.","The national payments corporation of india (npci) has rolled out new performance-centric guidelines for the upi ecosystem.

"'Tech is not the problem, compulsiveness is'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tech-is-not-the-problem-compulsiveness-is/articleshow/123051733.cms,"Who you are will decide how you use technology, says Sadhguru in an exclusive interview. Excerpts:

How big a problem is

digital addiction

, especially for the young? How can they be helped to overcome its ill effects?

How can the young protect their mental health in the modern, fast-paced world? Are changes required in the education system?

Is there an effective way to deal with stress?

You recently had two brain surgeries. How did you and those who are close to you handle the anxiety?

How did you separate physical pain from mental suffering?

It is not technology that is the problem, compulsiveness is. Today, in many countries, they have technology de-addiction centres, where people go to learn how to live without a phone! It's a huge achievement for them to put their phone away for whatever number of days.The beautiful thing about technology is if you learn to use it, it works for you. But who you are will decide how you use it. So what we need to fix right now in the world is who we are. We have all become many things that we are not. Essentially, we are born as life on this planet; the rest of the things are taught to us. We should stop teaching all this stuff which makes us something other than human beings.The internet or a phone is not the problem, but what is on it is the question. Now, some children are playing video games on phones. Two-three hours a day they are practising how to kill someone. Once they turn 18, will they be satisfied just shooting them on the phone? We are putting our children through this, and then we think they are violent, that they are wrong. No. Who is putting this content on the phone? Is it the children? No, adults are putting it - everything has become about commerce.Technology is a tremendous enabler. It gives us the means to reach the entire humanity. This was never possible before. When you have this capability, why do we think we cannot transform the world? We can. But are we committed to making it happen?Instead of reacting compulsively, we must learn to respond consciously to everything.When the British left India, literacy rate was low. Initially, our focus was on basic literacy. However, now the time has come for education to become more specialised and competency-oriented. Today, fewer students are opting for core sciences because our education system has always been job-oriented. Yes, that focus was necessary at one point. But many parents today can support their children as they pursue something meaningful - even if it doesn't immediately translate into economic benefit.We can relax the pace and focus on core education - on sciences, the arts, music. And even within technology, we need to encourage work at the cutting edge, which requires a much deeper level of application. Because if you don't immerse yourself in something, nothing profound will ever come of it.Stress is not in the situation; stress is in the way we are. It's not caused by your job, relationship, or anything external. It's because you haven't learned to manage your body, mind, emotions, and energies. When I first went to the US, I heard the term 'stress management'. I couldn't understand it. Why would anyone want to manage stress? You manage your money, business, relationships - not stress. But in the West, they've come to believe that stress is a universal condition and needs to be managed. However, stress is not a universal phenomenon, it's an individual malady.I had never been in a hospital before; the gown, the setting - everything was new. Was it painful? Absolutely - 100%. Did I suffer mentally? No.Pain is physical. If pain didn't exist, you wouldn't know how to protect your body. Suffering, however, is something you manufacture in your mind. As far as possible, when you walk through life, your job is to avoid creating suffering for others. But if you have mastered the art of creating suffering for yourself, you will inevitably create suffering for others too, knowingly or unknowingly.","Technology is not the problem, but what is on it is the question, says sadhguru.

A separate meeting with leather sector exporters is scheduled for August 4 in New Delhi, PTI reported.The US on Friday imposed a 25% tariff on Indian goods, potentially affecting about half of the country’s $86-billion exports to the American market. The remaining half, including pharmaceuticals, electronics, and petroleum products, remains exempt.India continues to hold discussions with the US to finalise a trade deal. However, sources said New Delhi would not compromise on issues related to agricultural, dairy, or genetically modified (GM) products. The sixth round of negotiations is scheduled for August 25 in India.Key export sectors expected to be affected by the new tariff include textiles and clothing ($10.3 billion), gems and jewellery ($12 billion), shrimp ($2.24 billion), leather and footwear ($1.18 billion), animal products ($2 billion), chemicals ($2.34 billion), and electrical and mechanical machinery (around $9 billion).In 2024–25, India-US bilateral trade stood at $131.8 billion, with Indian exports at $86.5 billion and imports at $45.3 billion.Exporters from the impacted sectors have called for immediate government support. “We request immediate government intervention to offset this huge setback. Exporters have their back against the wall and will have to sell below cost to keep their factories running and avoid mass layoffs,” said Sudhir Sekhri, Chairman, Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC).Rahul Guha, Senior Director at Crisil Ratings, said Indian shrimp exporters face an unprecedented challenge in the US market, which accounts for nearly 48% of their shipments.","Commerce and industry minister piyush goyal will meet exporters from sectors including food processing, textiles, engineering, and chemicals.

"'Limited direct impact from US tariffs': Fitch revises India GDP forecast to 6.3% for FY26; infrastructure spending, local demand seen supporting key sectors",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/limited-direct-impact-from-us-tariffs-fitch-revises-india-gdp-forecast-to-6-3-for-fy26-infrastructure-spending-local-demand-seen-supporting-key-sectors/articleshow/123048853.cms,"Fitch Ratings has revised India’s GDP growth projection for the current financial year down to 6.3%, from its earlier estimate of 6.4%, while stating that the recently announced US tariffs are likely to have only a limited direct effect on Indian corporates.In its latest India Corporates Credit Trends report released Friday, the global rating agency said it expects robust infrastructure spending to sustain demand across core sectors, PTI reported.“We expect India’s GDP growth of 6.3 per cent and robust infrastructure spending to underpin healthy demand for cement and building materials, electricity, petroleum products, steel, and engineering and construction (E&C) companies during FY26,” Fitch noted.The revised forecast comes months after the agency projected 6.4% GDP growth in its Global Economic Outlook report published in April.Despite the macroeconomic adjustment, Fitch anticipates credit metrics for rated Indian corporates to improve in FY26. Wider EBITDA margins are expected to offset the effects of high capital expenditure, it added.On the impact of the 25% US tariffs recently announced by President Donald Trump—along with a penalty targeting Indian trade ties with Russia—Fitch said the direct impact on rated Indian corporates would likely remain limited, owing to low-to-moderate exposure to US exports.However, the report cautioned about potential “second-order risks” arising from global excess supply. Fitch also noted that an eventual India-US trade agreement may alter outcomes, and companies are likely to explore export diversification to mitigate the tariff shock.India and the US are in the midst of negotiations for a bilateral trade deal. According to reports, New Delhi has taken a firm stance against Washington’s demand for duty concessions on agriculture and dairy products—sectors where India has traditionally offered no preferential tariffs in any FTA.Fitch said that sectors focused on the domestic market—such as upstream and downstream oil & gas, cement and building materials, telecom, utilities, and engineering and construction—should see minimal tariff-related disruptions due to strong local demand and regulatory insulation.In contrast, Fitch highlighted that tariff uncertainty may dampen discretionary exports in IT services and automotive components to the US and Europe during FY26. Pharmaceuticals could also be vulnerable to policy changes from the US side.Additionally, the report said that steel and chemicals may face pricing pressure from oversupplied global markets, while the metals and mining sector could experience higher price volatility due to emerging global growth risks.","Fitch ratings has revised india’s gdp growth projection for the current financial year down to 6.3%, from its earlier estimate of 6.4%.

Thinking Machines Lab: a startup with billion-dollar belief

Why Murati’s team said no to Meta

A name to watch in AI’s future





Mira Murati, the Albanian-American tech visionary behind some of the most significant breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, is once again in the spotlight—this time for turning down an eye-watering $1 billion offer from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg . As the former CTO of OpenAI and now the founder of the AI startup Thinking Machines Lab, Murati has become one of the most influential figures in the global AI race. Her team's unanimous rejection of Meta’s massive offer speaks volumes about their confidence in her leadership and their belief in the startup’s long-term vision.Before launching Thinking Machines Lab, Mira Murati served as the chief technology officer at OpenAI, one of the most influential positions in the modern AI world. During her tenure, she played a pivotal role in leading the development of groundbreaking technologies such as ChatGPT, DALL·E, and Codex—systems that have since transformed the way people interact with artificial intelligence. Her work helped bring generative AI into the mainstream, sparking a global wave of innovation across industries from education and healthcare to design and coding.Murati wasn’t just a technical leader—she was a strategic visionary. At OpenAI, she emphasized the importance of safety, alignment, and responsible development, pushing the organization to think deeply about the societal impact of powerful AI systems.Internally, she earned the reputation of being the “AI brain” behind OpenAI’s most ambitious projects, praised for her calm, focused demeanor and her ability to guide multidisciplinary teams through intense periods of innovation. Her combination of engineering precision and human-centered thinking set the stage for her next bold move: founding her own AI company.In early 2025, she delivered a keynote at the World Economic Forum in Davos, warning that “AI without values is intelligence without conscience,” sparking international dialogue on AI ethics and sovereignty. She’s also been advising the European Commission on emerging AI regulatory frameworks, a rare role for a startup founder. Her ability to bridge the worlds of deep tech and global policy has made her one of the few technologists shaping both the tools and the laws that will define this century. Her growing influence in policy circles signals that she’s not just building AI—but helping shape the rules by which it will operate.Founded in early 2025, Thinking Machines Lab has rapidly emerged as one of the most-watched AI startups. Despite not launching a single product yet, the company recently raised a stunning $2 billion seed round at a valuation nearing $12 billion, led by Andreessen Horowitz. The startup’s goal: to create customizable, interpretable, and widely accessible AI systems that could redefine the AI landscape. Industry insiders say the company’s stealth mode only adds to its mystique. With Murati at the helm, expectations are sky-high for what comes next.According to a Wired report, Zuckerberg's Meta offered some of Murati’s team members compensation packages ranging from $200 million to $1 billion to join its newly launched Superintelligence Lab. But every single offer was turned down. Sources say the Thinking Machines Lab team believes their equity in the startup has the potential to be worth far more—and more importantly, they value their independence and Murati’s vision over big-tech paychecks.In a tech industry where massive paydays often drive decisions, the loyalty displayed by Murati’s team stands out. The rejection of Meta’s lucrative offers highlights their belief in the startup’s mission and long-term potential. Their decision also reflects a broader shift in tech culture—one where founders and engineers alike are prioritizing purpose, values, and trust over headline-making payouts. Many observers also note that the chance to help shape AI’s future from the ground up, without the constraints of a corporate giant, is a rare and meaningful opportunity—one Murati has worked hard to create.Mira Murati’s leadership has already been recognized worldwide—she was featured in Time’s 100 Most Influential People in AI (2024) and Fortune’s 100 Most Powerful Women in Business (2023). With Thinking Machines Lab gaining momentum and Meta's billion-dollar offers rebuffed, Murati has solidified her place not just as a builder of AI—but as a shaper of its future. She has become a quiet icon of resistance against the centralization of AI power—choosing to innovate outside the usual corporate echo chambers.","Mira murati, founder of thinking machines lab, turned down $1 billion offer from meta ceo mark zuckerberg.

ESPN has officially cut ties with Hall of Fame tight end and media personality Shannon Sharpe. The announcement came just days after Sharpe quietly settled a $50 million lawsuit filed by his ex-girlfriend, alleging rape and sexual assault. Though Sharpe had been absent from ESPN broadcasts since April, this formal separation signals a sharp turn in his professional trajectory.According to Celebrity Net Worth, Shannon Sharpe has an estimated net worth of $30 million. While exact figures from his ESPN salary remain undisclosed, industry analysts speculate that his compensation was likely in the high eight-figure range. Some reports even suggested his earnings could rival Stephen A. Smith’s, whose deals reportedly range from $12 to $20 million annually.Sharpe's leverage came from his cross-platform success, as his podcast ventures consistently trended and expanded his audience far beyond traditional sports media. Even without ESPN, his influence – and income stream – remain substantial.Once hailed as one of the greatest tight ends to ever play in the NFL, Shannon Sharpe built a résumé that earned him a first-ballot induction into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2011.Across 14 seasons, he shattered records at his position – 815 receptions, over 10,000 receiving yards, and 62 touchdowns – although those benchmarks have since been surpassed.Sharpe’s career began at Savannah State and flourished after the Denver Broncos selected him in the 7th round of the 1990 NFL Draft. Despite his low draft status, he quickly rose to prominence, spending nine seasons with Denver before moving to the Baltimore Ravens in 2000. That same year, Sharpe signed a four-year, $13.8 million deal – a significant contract at the time — and helped lead the Ravens to a dominant Super Bowl XXXV win.He returned to the Broncos in 2002 with a seven-year, $16 million contract, retiring just a year later. Although his NFL earnings of $22.3 million may not stand out in today’s financial climate, he was among the better-compensated tight ends of his era.Off the field, Sharpe remained a dynamic presence in the media. His popular shows, Club Shay Shay and Nightcap with Chad Ochocinco, continued to build his brand independently. These ventures arguably amplified his bargaining power within ESPN, making his exit all the more significant. It will be seen closely who replaced Sharpe at ESPN now.A: Shannon Sharpe's estimated net worth stands at $30 million.A: ESPN ended ties shortly after Sharpe settled a $50 million lawsuit filed by his ex-girlfriend.A: Club Shay Shay and Nightcap with Chad Ochocinco.Also Read: Tom Brady blames football sacrifices for family rift in emotional letter, takes veiled shot at Gisele Bündchen","Espn has officially cut ties with hall of fame tight end and media personality shannon sharpe.

‘Bill Gates has no role in toxic food coating’: Michelle Pfeiffer apologises after spreading misinformation; what is the controversy about Apeel’s food coating,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bill-gates-has-no-role-in-toxic-food-coating-michelle-pfeiffer-apologises-after-spreading-misinformation-what-is-the-controversy-about-apeels-food-coating/articleshow/123037875.cms,"Bill Gates’ name wrongly linked to Apeel in viral misinformation

How did Apeel respond

Pfeiffer apologizes and retracts earlier claims

The larger debate on food tech, trust, and responsibility





In July 2025, actress Michelle Pfeiffer sparked controversy when she shared posts on social media claiming that Apeel, a food technology company backed by Bill Gates , was contaminating organic produce. Pfeiffer's posts stated that organic produce ""is no longer safe"" because Apeel's edible plant-based coating, recently approved by the USDA for organic certification, is invisible and ""cannot be washed off. "" She implied a direct connection between Gates and ownership of Apeel. Shortly after, Apeel clarified that Bill Gates has no ownership or involvement in the company beyond two small grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2012 and 2015. Pfeiffer later apologized, acknowledging she had shared outdated and inaccurate information about Apeel and its safety.Apeel Sciences, founded in 2012, develops an edible coating made from plant-derived ingredients such as citric acid and baking soda, designed to extend the shelf life of fruits and vegetables and reduce food waste. The product, called OrganiPeel, was formally FDA approved in 2024 and has been used in grocery stores since 2017. Apeel received two grants totaling approximately $1.1 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, but Bill Gates himself is neither a founder, shareholder, nor involved in operations. The company emphasizes its commitment to sustainability and improving food access worldwide.On July 10, 2025, Michelle Pfeiffer shared posts warning her followers that organic produce coated with Apeel was no longer safe to consume, emphasizing the coating's supposed invisibility and inability to wash off.She also posted a list of major grocery chains that do not sell Apeel-coated produce. These claims echoed long-running social media smear campaigns that falsely accused Apeel of contaminating food and overstated Gates's involvement. The misinformation prompted backlash from Apeel, its representatives, and many food safety experts who contested Pfeiffer’s assertions.Apeel representatives firmly denied the allegations related to food safety and company ownership. They stressed that their product is edible, made from responsibly sourced plant oils, and can be removed by simply rinsing and gently scrubbing produce. Apeel also clarified that Bill Gates has ""zero involvement or ownership"" in the company, and that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's funding was limited to grants with no controlling influence. The company reaffirmed its transparent mission to reduce food insecurity and improve sustainability in food systems.Three weeks after her initial posts, Pfeiffer returned to social media to issue a public apology. She admitted to unintentionally sharing outdated and inaccurate information about Apeel's product and ownership. Pfeiffer confirmed having spoken directly with Apeel representatives, learning that OrganiPeel is neither a new product nor exclusively linked to Bill Gates. She emphasized the importance of accurate public conversations on food safety and sustainability and expressed regret for spreading misinformation.This incident reflects ongoing tensions and misinformation in public discourse surrounding new food technologies and influential figures like Bill Gates. While some commentators applauded Pfeiffer for raising awareness, others criticized the spread of unverified claims that fuel distrust in science-based innovations. Apeel's case highlights the challenges companies face in balancing transparency, innovation, and public perception amid rapid advances in food technology. Pfeiffer's correction serves as a reminder of the responsibility public figures hold in verifying information before sharing it widely.","Actress michelle pfeiffer sparked controversy when she shared posts on social media claiming that apeel, a food technology company backed by bill gates, was contaminating organic produce.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123037889,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-54030,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Starting August 1, 2025, India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) the backbone of digital transactions will witness a significant upgrade. These changes, implemented by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), are designed to make UPI safer, more efficient, and capable of handling ever-growing transaction volumes.India processes over 12 billion UPI transactions per month, and the system is under constant pressure, especially during peak usage hours. The new rules focus on controlling excessive server requests, protecting users from fraud, and improving overall transaction experience. Key updates include balance enquiry limits, fixed auto-payment windows, restrictions on bank detail access, and enhanced recipient verification measures.If you use Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, Amazon Pay, or any bank-based UPI app, these changes will directly impact your daily transactions.UPI apps often receive millions of daily balance check requests, creating heavy server traffic. From now, users can check their account balance only 50 times per day. To reduce inconvenience, the system will automatically display available balance after every transaction, eliminating the need for repeated manual checks.Auto-debits (subscriptions, loan repayments, OTT payments) create sudden load spikes during peak banking hours.From August 1:Users can now view linked bank accounts only 25 times per day. This prevents misuse by malicious apps or repeated refresh requests, improving data safety and reducing load on bank servers.Many users repeatedly check the status of pending transactions, which strains servers. Now, users can check transaction status only three times, with a mandatory 90-second gap between attempts. This change aims to cut down unnecessary traffic while still giving users visibility of their funds.Before confirming any payment, the recipient’s registered name and transaction ID will be displayed. This feature prevents accidental transfers to incorrect UPI IDs or fraudulent accounts pretending to be legitimate businesses.NPCI has warned UPI app providers: failure to implement these changes could lead to API restrictions, financial penalties, or suspension of new customer onboarding.The decision to update UPI rules stems from two main concerns:No. Sending and receiving money remains unaffected. The rules focus mainly on balance checks, auto-pay processing, and fraud prevention features.Excessive balance requests (especially by third-party apps) cause unnecessary server load. Limiting to 50 checks per day ensures stable performance for all users.Recurring payments may be processed slightly earlier or later than scheduled. Users will receive notifications when payments are executed, preventing missed due dates.Yes, but only three times, with a 90-second gap between attempts.

Reddit’s financial earnings



Reddit is all set to make a bold pivot towards becoming a full-fledged search engine. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman recently announced the plans to prioritise search functionality and AI-powered answers across the platform. The announcement came as part of the company's Q2 2025 shareholder letter, which highlighted strong financial performance driven by advertising and a growing user base. “Reddit a go-to search engine, and expanding internationally,” said Huffman. The move comes amid explosive growth in Reddit’s internal search usage, which now sees over 70 million weekly queries.During the earnings call, CEO Steve Huffman framed the initiative as a natural evolution for the platform, which has long been the de facto search engine for millions seeking genuine, opinion-based answers. ""For years, people have been adding 'reddit' to their search queries to find real experiences, recommendations, and discussions,"" Huffman stated. ""Our communities are the world's most valuable database of human experience. We're simply building the infrastructure to make that wisdom more accessible and searchable.""Reddit’s pitch is simple: real people, real answers. In a world increasingly dominated by algorithmic summaries, Reddit believes that nuanced, lived experiences are irreplaceable. A recent survey showed that 80% of users trust human responses over AI-generated ones for complex questions.“To focus on the areas that matter most, we are deprioritising a few initiatives, including our work on the user economy. It’s still an opportunity we believe in, but we’re concentrating our resources on the areas that will drive results for our most pressing needs: improving the core product, making Reddit a go-to search engine, and expanding internationally,” said Huffman.Reddit’s Q2 revenue hit $500 million, up 78% year-over-year, with a net income of $89 million and a gross margin of 90.8%. Advertising revenue alone soared to $465 million, driven by new AI-enhanced ad formats like Conversation Summary Add-ons, which boost clickthrough rates by 10%.With Q3 revenue projected between $535 million and $545 million, Reddit is doubling down on search, deprioritizing other initiatives like its user economy to focus on core product improvements and international growth.","Reddit ceo steve huffman recently announced the plans to prioritise search functionality and ai-powered answers across the platform.

A stepping stone to AGI?

Internal and external pressure on OpenAI

As artificial intelligence continues to advance at an astonishing pace, even the leaders at its forefront are beginning to voice concern. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has openly admitted feeling “scared” about the upcoming release of GPT-5, the newest and most powerful version of ChatGPT. Scheduled to launch in August 2025, GPT-5 is expected to significantly surpass its predecessors in speed and capability. Yet it is precisely this rapid evolution that has led Altman to compare its development to the Manhattan Project. His candid remarks, shared during a recent podcast appearance, highlight growing unease about the lack of oversight, ethical uncertainty, and the accelerating race toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).Speaking on Theo Von’s This Past Weekend podcast, Altman confessed that testing GPT-5 left him with a profound sense of unease. “It feels very fast,” he said, referring not just to the model’s impressive processing power, but to the alarming speed at which AI is advancing overall. His remarks echoed the reflective anxiety of scientists involved in the Manhattan Project, who, after creating the atomic bomb, grappled with the unintended consequences of their innovation. Altman invoked a similar moment of reckoning, asking rhetorically, “What have we done?” The comparison underscores his concern that GPT-5, like nuclear technology before it, may mark a pivotal turning point—one where humanity’s ability to build something outpaces its readiness to understand or control the fallout. He emphasized that while technical achievements are accelerating, the moral, social, and legal frameworks to contain them are not keeping pace.One of Altman’s most pointed comments was about the lack of control in AI development. “It feels like there are no adults in the room,” he said, suggesting that regulatory frameworks have not kept up with AI's breakneck speed. While OpenAI advocates for responsible deployment, the pace at which GPT-5 was built may have outstripped safety protocols and human readiness. These remarks have sparked fresh debate about who, if anyone, is truly in charge of monitoring such transformative technologies.While specifics about GPT-5 remain under wraps, insiders suggest it will feature major upgrades over GPT-4, including improved multi-step reasoning, longer memory, and more advanced multimodal capabilities. It is also expected to reduce model-switching delays, offering more seamless user interactions. But with power comes risk. Altman has openly said that GPT-4 “kind of sucks” compared to what’s coming next. That raises alarms about how much more potent and possibly uncontrollable GPT-5 could be. Concerns are mounting about how society will distinguish between authentic human thought and AI-generated insightAltman has long discussed AGI, or Artificial General Intelligence, as OpenAI’s north star. But GPT-5 may be the company’s closest step yet to that goal. While Altman once claimed the arrival of AGI would pass with little societal upheaval, his new tone is more cautionary. If GPT-5 gets us significantly closer to AGI-level capabilities, the lack of global consensus on how to manage such a leap could become a major problem. The shift from AI that assists to AI that independently reasons and acts could happen faster than institutions can respond.Behind the scenes, OpenAI is reportedly under immense pressure from investors to transition into a for-profit entity by year-end. With Microsoft holding a 13.5 billion dollar stake in the company, and other competitors like Google DeepMind and Perplexity.ai surging forward, GPT-5 could be a make-or-break moment. Some reports even suggest OpenAI might declare AGI prematurely to end its contract with Microsoft, triggering new power dynamics in the AI sector.While some observers have dismissed Altman’s remarks as theatrical marketing, his track record suggests otherwise. His fear appears genuine, not of AI turning evil, but of humans losing control over the systems they’ve built. In a space where speed is often equated with success, Altman’s words might be the first honest pause in a race most of the world barely understands.","Openai ceo sam altman has openly admitted feeling “scared” about the upcoming release of gpt-5, the newest and most powerful version of chatgpt.

In March, Cannon-Brookes took to professional networking site LinkedIn to defend his decision to acquire a Bombardier 7500, an aircraft which is believed to cost over US$75 million, stating that this purchase would allow him to be a ""present dad."" The latest layoffs were also reportedly defended by Atlassian’s other co-founder and former CEO Scott Farquhar.According to a report by SkyNews Australia, Atlassian employees who were impacted in this round of job cuts were informed of the job cuts via a pre-recorded video message from Cannon-Brookes. In the video, seen by the publication, the CEO spoke from a home office in a faded green hoodie.However, the Cannon-Brookes did not name the affected individuals, who reportedly had to wait 15 minutes for an email confirming their status. Impacted staff had their laptops blocked, but are expected to receive payment for the next six months, the report noted.Meanwhile, Farquhar, Atlassian's other cofounder, has also reportedly defended the layoffs, saying that Australia’s copyright laws should be updated to allow AI companies unrestricted access to mine data.In a statement to the Sydney Morning Herald, Farquhar said: “Earlier this year, Atlassian faced criticism for Cannon-Brookes buying a personal jet for upwards of $75 million despite his support for climate action and promotion of solar power. He has reportedly been investing heavily in eco-friendly projects, including a solar power cable from Darwin to Singapore.In a post shared on LinkedIn, Cannon-Brookes wrote:","Jira software maker atlassian has laid off 150 employees, a report claims.
