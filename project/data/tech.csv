A320 Grounded: Here Is Why 6000 Aircraft Across World Couldn't Fly | Inside Story Of Software Snag

Regulators step in as airbus issues global warning





Airlines push through updates as delays ripple across airports





IndiGo confirmed late on Saturday that all 200 aircraft in its A320-family fleet had been fully updated, becoming the first major Indian operator to complete the mandatory enhancement. In a message posted on X, the airline said the work was “carefully coordinated” between engineering and operations teams and carried out with “minimal impact on customers’ journeys and zero cancellations”. It added that the entire fleet was now flying with the latest approved configuration, with routine monitoring continuing.Air India and Air India Express also reported rapid progress, with more than 90% of their affected aircraft upgraded by Saturday night. The push came after aviation regulators in India and Europe issued urgent directives requiring operators to install software protections designed to prevent possible data corruption in flight-control systems.Airbus triggered the global response on Friday after telling operators that intense solar radiation could corrupt data in key flight-control computers. The company identified a “significant number” of A320 family aircraft as potentially at risk and urged immediate installation of updated software or, in some cases, hardware realignment.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) issued an Airworthiness Directive soon after, covering a wide range of A319, A320 and A321 variants. Indian airlines were instructed to carry out the upgrades without delay, with a deadline set for early Sunday morning.Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury issued an apology to airlines and passengers affected by delays, saying, “I want to sincerely apologise to our airline customers and passengers who are impacted now. But we consider that nothing is more important than safety when people fly on one of our Airbus aircraft… Our teams are working around the clock to support our operators and ensure these updates are deployed as swiftly as possible. ”According to DGCA data, 338 Indian A320-family aircraft required the update, with modifications completed on more than 270 by Saturday evening. IndiGo upgraded 184 of its 200 affected aircraft earlier in the day, before confirming full completion later at night. Air India reported successful resets on over 90% of its operating A320 fleet, while Air India Express said 22 of its 25 impacted aircraft had been updated.The upgrades—conducted at bases in Delhi, Mumbai, Bengaluru, Chennai, Hyderabad, Ahmedabad and Kolkata—caused delays of 60–90 minutes at several airports. Air India Express cancelled four flights, though IndiGo and Air India avoided cancellations.Aviation experts said the issue demanded swift action. Former pilot Ehsan Khalid explained that the affected Elevator Aileron Computer (ELAC) is central to flight control: “The software problem with one of the ELACs is significant,” he said, citing a JetBlue incident where an A320 experienced an uncommanded pitch-down, injuring passengers.With most Indian aircraft now updated and global airlines racing to do the same, regulators and Airbus say they expect normal operations to resume rapidly—though full worldwide compliance may take longer, given the nearly 6,000 aircraft requiring upgrades.","Indigo confirmed late on saturday that all 200 aircraft in its a320-family fleet had been fully updated.

In his keynote address at an event here to celebrate the 121st birth anniversary of Tata Group founder JRD Tata, Chandrasekaran said when the group bought Air India in 2022, he was asked why it was entering the aviation sector. “But I firmly believe for Tata Group, Air India is not just a business opportunity. It’s a responsibility,” he said.“Every single percentage growth in GDP will give a 2% growth in the domestic aviation sector. (If) India grows 8%, the aviation industry grows 16%. And this game will play out... at least for the next three decades. So, this is going to be a very exciting phase of economic growth, and for the aviation sector in particular,” he said, adding, “But it’s not easy. It’s increasingly difficult because the sector faces continuous challenges. ” He said the global supply chain makes the availability of parts, infrastructure and new aircraft unpredictable.Chandrasekaran also mentioned that aviation is a very capital-intensive business and the industry margins are thin. Noting that India is already the fourth largest economy, and becoming the third largest economy, he said the 8.2% GDP growth in the July-Sept quarter was “just fabulous.”And India will grow at 7% at least, this fiscal year, he added.According to him, there is increasing consumer confidence and consumption-led growth, and public infrastructure spending will additionally drive growth. “So, we will become a $5 trillion economy, and we will grow beyond that. We will do it faster, and the pace at which we add every additional trillion dollar will be shorter, and we will create exciting opportunities. But if this has to happen, one of the aspects that needs to work is connectivity,” he said.He said there are several aspects of the industry that one has to manage. “Geopolitics is a surprise. Suddenly, your flight routes will change, because you cannot fly over a territory. Your flights take longer, your fuel costs go up... We have to manage all of this,” he said.Chandrasekaran said demand for air travel is very high, and the aspirations of Indians are growing as everybody wants to be connected andtravel. “So I think our commitment is to build a world-class airline,” he further said.",Tata sons chairman n chandrasekaran said air india is not just a business opportunity but a “responsibility” for tata group.

IndiGo And Air India Warn Of Delays As Airbus Solar Radiation Snag Hits 350 A320 Jets In India

NEW DELHI: Airlines across nation are rushing to complete emergency software upgrades on more than 350 Airbus A320-family aircraft after a rare global safety directive warned that intense solar radiation could corrupt flight-control data and trigger sudden, uncommanded aircraft movements.The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) ordered immediate compliance on Saturday after Airbus flagged a vulnerability in ELAC B flight-control computers running software version L104, the same configuration linked to an October 30 JetBlue A320 incident in which the aircraft unexpectedly pitched downward without pilot input, injuring several passengers and prompting a US federal investigation.The Ministry of Civil Aviation, quoted by ANI, said late Saturday that IndiGo, Air India and Air India Express have accelerated upgrades across their fleets and expect full compliance by the end of the day. IndiGo has 200 affected aircraft and has completed upgrades on 184, with the remainder expected to be cleared by 23:59 hours. Air India has 113 aircraft requiring the fix and has completed 69 installations, while Air India Express has upgraded 17 of its 25 affected aircraft. The DGCA has stressed that no aircraft may operate until the mandatory modification is complete, except for repositioning flights to maintenance bases.Airbus issued the urgent global alert after determining that solar flares can, under certain conditions, corrupt data used by the aircraft’s elevator control computers, potentially causing unexpected control-surface movements. The company has instructed operators worldwide to immediately revert to an earlier, stable software version. The issue affects about 6,000 A320-family aircraft globally, although roughly 1,000 older jets may require hardware replacements, a process that will take longer.The directive has triggered widespread disruption during one of the busiest travel periods of the year, with airlines across Europe and the Americas reporting delays and cancellations as they verify software versions and apply the fix. American Airlines has identified hundreds of aircraft requiring the update, Air France has cancelled several flights, Avianca has paused ticket sales into December, and carriers including Delta, Finnair, Volaris and Air New Zealand have warned of operational impact. Europe’s aviation regulator, EASA, has directed operators to complete the fix before their next flight, acknowledging the inconvenience but underscoring that safety remains paramount.Although the update takes only around two hours per aircraft, maintenance lines worldwide are already stretched by ongoing engine-related groundings and labour shortages, forcing airlines to use overnight maintenance windows and short turnaround periods to complete the repair. Airbus’s directive is among the most significant recalls in its history and comes at a time when more than 3,000 A320-family aircraft were airborne globally, highlighting the scale and urgency of the operation.India operates one of the world’s largest A320 fleets, dominated by IndiGo and the Air India group. The A320, which introduced fly-by-wire controls to commercial aviation in the 1980s, now accounts for a substantial share of global traffic. The latest safety update adds to the mounting technical pressures on the aviation sector as regulators move quickly to address emerging electronic and software vulnerabilities linked to space-weather events.","Indigo, air india and air india express have accelerated upgrades across their fleets and expect full compliance by the end of the day.

Deepfake Shock: Nirmala Sitharaman Reveals Fake Videos Of Herself Online, Warns Of AI’s Dark Side

Armour up with TOI to fight deepening threat of deepfakes





In a world where seeing is no longer believing, India is facing a new digital menace: AI-generated deepfakes.These hyper-realistic videos and audio clips don’t just distort reality. They manipulate public perception, spread misinformation and undermine trust in democracy itself.With 85.5 per cent of Indian households owning at least one smartphone, mobile phones have become India’s bank, classroom and television, making citizens more vulnerable to digital deception.During the 2024 elections, for instance, satirical deepfakes became a campaign tool of sorts. Apart from resurrecting dead leaders, it featured clips such as one that featured PM Narendra Modi dancing the garba with women and Kamal Nath dissing a popular welfare scheme.Though investigations and arrests followed, such videos blur the line between fact and fiction, risking the distortion of voter opinion and the integrity of the democratic process.Cybersecurity experts warn AI is also becoming a key tool in cybercrime: 80 per cent phishing campaigns in 2024 involved AI, with deepfakes exploited for scams.“When you can fake images, audio, and video, how do you know if a real video is real? Suddenly, everything is in question,” said Hany Farid, professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in a TOI interview last year about the worrying rise in AI misuse.The deepfake threat extends beyond politics. Recently, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman highlighted the misuse of AI to clone voices and produce fake videos impersonating her, warning of potential financial scams and the erosion of public trust. “I have seen several deepfake videos of myself being circulated online, manipulated to mislead citizens and distort facts,” Sitharaman said in Mumbai. “Criminals are using AI to mimic voices, clone identities, and create lifelike videos,” she added.Given that over 97% of India’s urban youth aged 15 to 29 owns a smartphone, the impact of such misinformation on a generation is worrying, say observers. “Deepfakes began in 2016. Back then, it was a joke. But the technology has only gotten better. Earlier, there were photoshopped face swaps. Now there are lipsync fakes,” said Prof. Farid, warning that the tech has become more refined, raising the risk of harassment of women through the use of non-consensual sexual imagery.In Nov 2023, actress Rashmika Mandanna became a victim of a viral deepfake video that superimposed her face on to compromising content, sparking widespread outrage. “The very term ‘deepfake’ comes from a Reddit user who in the early days of this technology used it to create porn,” said Farid, calling the new term ‘Generative AI’ clever “rebranding” by the male-dominated tech industry.As AI evolves, India must strengthen legal frameworks, enhance digital literacy, and bring together minds across sectors to ensure safety, say experts. “We need to label everything as real or not real,” said Farid, “We need real disclosures.” To combat the deepening threat of deep fakes, TOI has already started armouring up. Watch out for our ‘Don’t Get Scammed’ stories to stay informed and aware. After all, as Farid puts it, “if you don’t know what’s real, how will you know what’s false”?","Ai-generated videos and audio clips don’t just distort reality.

NEW DELHI: A cosmic curveball forced a frantic fix as Indian operators of Airbus's best-selling A320 aircraft worked through the weekend to undo a software upgrade now tied to solar-flare risk.They rushed to roll back flight-control updates on 338 identified aircraft. IndiGo, Air India and Air India Express expect to finish the downgrade by late Saturday-Sunday night, averting what regulators warned could have caused pilots to briefly lose control during intense radiation events. Not all A320s were impacted.Working under DGCA supervision, airlines pushed the fixes without grounding fleets and avoiding mass cancellations at the peak of holiday travel. Updates took roughly 40-50 minutes for each aircraft. By 5.30pm Saturday, only four Air India Express flights were cancelled, with carriers bracing for delays of up to 90 minutes.According to DGCA, IndiGo, the world's largest A320 operator, had updated 184 of 200 affected jets by Saturday evening; Air India 69 of 113; Air India Express 17 of 25 - 278 aircraft, or 82% of the 338 flagged globally in Indian fleets. IndiGo announced before midnight it had completed the task.Earlier, IndiGo said on X its engineers had completed updates on 160 of 200 mandated aircraft by Saturday evening, with ""minimal delays and zero cancellations"", and expected to meet all deadlines.Air India said its teams had worked ""round-the-clock,"" anticipated full compliance within EASA's timelines and reported ""no cancellations"" due to the task, though some flights would run slightly late.Air India Express said most of its A320 fleet was already compliant and remaining aircraft were on track, crediting coordinated work across engineering, operations and safety teams.Airbus triggered the scramble late Friday after directing operators to revert flight control computers to a 2022 software build. Regulators in Europe, India and US quickly issued emergency orders.The move followed an Oct 30 JetBlue A320 event in which the jet allegedly pitched nose-down without pilot input while flying Cancun-Newark. The aircraft diverted to Tampa, where 15-20 passengers injured in the uncontrolled descent were hospitalised. Investigators later linked the issue to an upgrade, dubbed L104, for the elevator and aileron computer (ELAC).Airbus warned that solar radiation could corrupt data critical to flight controls on certain software-hardware combinations, prompting operators to revert to the older build on susceptible jets.Indian carriers received the first late-night alert around 9.30pm Friday. ""At first, it seemed a much bigger issue that would require grounding and a massive impact,"" said an official managing the response. Coordinated work across multiple maintenance bases revealed the rollback could be completed in under 50 minutes on newer aircraft, while older jets required additional hardware changes.Global carriers also cancelled and delayed services as the scale of the alert briefly appeared to run into thousands of aircraft before being narrowed to a smaller subset. Airbus said it acted after analysing an event ""revealing that intense solar radiation may corrupt data critical to the functioning of flight controls"", adding it worked with regulators to ensure fleets remained safe.",Indian operators of airbus's best-selling a320 aircraft worked through the weekend to undo a software upgrade.

Explained: Why Vikram-I Could Transform India’s Satellite Launch Market And Global Space Leadership

HYDERABAD/NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Thursday virtually inaugurated Hyderabad-based spacetech startup Skyroot Aerospace’s Infinity campus and unveiled India’s first commercial orbital rocket, Vikram-I, which will launch satellites into low Earth orbit (LEO).Emphasising that India is on track to emerge as a global leader in the satellite launch ecosystem, Modi said, “The private sector is making giant strides in India's space sector. Skyroot's Infinity campus is a reflection of new thinking, innovation and most importantly, youth power. Our youth's innovation, risk-taking ability and entrepreneurship are touching new heights.”Extending his best wishes to Skyroot CEO Pawan Kumar Chandana and company co-founder Naga Bharath Daka, the PM said the two entrepreneurs are an inspiration for young people. “Growth of the private space sector, spearheaded by companies like Skyroot, is also a testament to the govt's efforts to foster innovation and private enterprise in the space domain,” he said.The Infinity facility, spread over 2 lakh sq ft in Hyderabad, will have the capability to design, develop, integrate and test multiple launch vehicles, with a capacity to build one orbital rocket every month. It adds to Skyroot's 55,000-sq-ft integrated rocket design and development facility — Max-Q — near Hyderabad airport.Pointing out that though India’s space journey began with limited resources, its ambitions were never limited, Modi said: “India has proven that the height of dreams is determined not by resources but by resolve. Today, India possesses space sector capabilities that only a few countries in the world have.”He also praised Isro, saying it “has for decades given new wings to India’s space journey.” Modi also recalled the reforms undertaken in the space sector, with his govt opening up the sector to private innovation and preparing a new Space Policy.Modi highlighted that more than 300 space startups are today powering India’s space aspirations, with most of them starting out with small teams. “Gen-Z engineers, designers, coders and scientists are creating new technologies, whether in propulsion systems, composite materials, rocket stages or satellite platforms.”Space promoter and regulator IN-SPACe chairman Dr Pawan Goenka said that in just five years since the space sector was opened up, over 350 space startups have emerged. “The Infinity campus and Vikram-1 are testaments to what can be achieved when entrepreneurial ambition meets enabling policy. We are building more than rockets. We are building a competitive space economy,” he said.Skyroot co-founder Pawan Chandana said the company was ready to launch Vikram-1, fully designed and built in India, in the next two months. Pointing out that decisive space reforms had unlocked the skies for startups to fly, co-founder Naga Bharath Daka said Skyroot has already generated over 1,000 hi-tech jobs and will be investing around Rs 1,000 crore soon to become one of the few companies worldwide to achieve rapid and on-demand launch capabilities.Set up in 2018 by the two IIT alumni and former Isro scientists, Skyroot became the first Indian company to successfully build and launch a rocket into space with suborbital rocket Vikram-S.","Pm narendra modi virtually inaugurated hyderabad-based spacetech startup skyroot aerospace’s infinity campus.

IndiGo And Air India Warn Of Delays As Airbus Solar Radiation Snag Hits 350 A320 Jets In India

10 things to know about the Airbus A320 recall





Airbus has ordered immediate repairs for around 6,000 A320-family aircraft, a move that is expected to affect more than half of the global fleet. This large-scale recall may cause widespread disruption, especially in the United States, where it coincides with one of the busiest travel weekends of the year.

Airbus has revealed that a recent incident involving one of its A320-family aircraft has uncovered a potential risk linked to ""intense solar radiation"", which may corrupt data essential for the aircraft's flight-control systems. Following this finding, the company identified a significant number of A320 aircraft currently in service that could be affected by the issue.

Air India has acknowledged the directive, saying it is “aware of a directive from Airbus related to its A320 family aircraft currently in service across airline operators,” and noted that the requirement will involve a “software/hardware realignment” on part of its fleet. The airline has warned that ""longer turnaround times and delays"" are likely during the update process.

Air India recently completed a major retrofit programme for its older A320neo fleet. With 27 refurbished aircraft, 14 newly delivered A320neos, and additional planes added after the Vistara merger, the airline now operates around 104 A320-family aircraft with new or upgraded interiors.

IndiGo has also confirmed compliance with the directive, emphasising that “safety comes first” and stating that it is carrying out the updates “with full diligence and care.” The airline has indicated that some flights may see schedule changes while the work is underway.

Most of IndiGo’s A320 fleet consists of newer variants, with older models now in single digits. With over 300 A320-family planes, the airline is expected to complete updates on nearly 250 aircraft by Monday or Tuesday, according to sources. Air India, with about 120–125 A320s, is expected to finish updates on more than 100 aircraft in a similar timeframe.

Industry observers say this may be one of the largest recalls Airbus has faced in its 55-year history, as Reuters reported. The timing is notable, coming just weeks after the A320 overtook the Boeing 737 as the most-delivered aircraft model in the world.

The repair itself is expected to be relatively simple and mainly involves reverting to a previous software version. Even so, airlines must complete the process before the planes can return to passenger service, except for repositioning flights to repair centres.

Airlines across North America, South America, Europe, India, and New Zealand have warned that the required repairs could lead to delays or cancellations. American Airlines, the largest A320 operator globally, expects to update around 340 of its 480 A320s, with each fix likely taking about two hours.

Other major airlines—such as Lufthansa, IndiGo, and easyJet—are also planning brief groundings for the updates. In South America, Avianca has said more than 70% of its fleet is affected, leading the carrier to temporarily shut ticket sales until December 8 for certain travel dates.

The recall comes at a challenging time for the aviation industry, which is already dealing with heavy workloads at repair shops, long delays for separate engine-related inspections, and labour shortages. These factors are expected to slow down the completion of repairs and add further pressure to global flight operations.

JetBlue incident leads to probe





NEW DELHI: Air travel in India and around the world is expected to face major disruptions after Europe-based Airbus issued a technical directive ordering a software upgrade for its A320 family aircraft. In India, more than 300 IndiGo and Air India A320 planes will remain grounded for the next two to three days while the update is carried out, with normal operations expected to resume by Monday or Tuesday.Globally, around 6,000 aircraft from A320 fleet are likely to be impacted. The grounding is significant because Airbus and its main rival Boeing together control over three-quarters of the world's commercial aircraft fleet, meaning any large-scale recall has an immediate and widespread impact on global air traffic.The technical directive reportedly came shortly after an incident involving a JetBlue A320 aircraft, which led to discussions among safety regulators and eventually contributed to a deeper review of the fleet’s software configuration. While details are still emerging, the episode is believed to have triggered closer scrutiny and may have played a role in Airbus deciding to issue a global advisory and recall order for immediate corrective action.","Airbus has ordered immediate repairs for around 6,000 a320-family aircraft.

Why the Phillies Would Accept

On-Field Fit and Lineup Impact

Pros, Cons, and Overall Verdict

A blockbuster trade built aroundand thewould instantly become one of the most fascinating storylines of the winter. While not an active or imminent negotiation, the concept makes enough baseball sense that it continues to surface in league speculation. The idea centers on Toronto gaining the middle-order thunder they’ve lacked, while Philadelphia reallocates resources from an aging slugger to a younger, more controllable core.The financial mechanics are a major part of the intrigue. Schwarber is expected to land a contract in the $35-40 million AAV range over four seasons, a level that reflects his near-MVP offensive output and long résumé of postseason impact. Any team acquiring him must weigh both the production and the significant financial weight attached.A clean version of this hypothetical deal sends Schwarber to Toronto - potentially with a bit of cash relief - while Philadelphia receives a versatile, inexpensive bat such as Davis Schneider plus one MLB-ready arm or upper-minors pitching prospect. The Phillies could choose to absorb a slice of Schwarber’s contract to upgrade the talent level coming back, a familiar tactic in trades involving star hitters on nine-figure deals.Toronto’s current roster leans heavily on Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Anthony Santander for power, with no true left-handed, full-time DH threat. Schwarber solves that instantly. He would slot into the No. 2 or No. 4 spot, surrounding Guerrero with on-base ability and elite home-run production. With seasons of 38 homers in 2024 and a massive 56-homer, 132-RBI campaign in 2025, he becomes their most dangerous slugger since the Bautista-Encarnación era. Toronto also gains a hitter built for October, as Schwarber owns double-digit postseason home runs and deep-run experience with multiple organizations.For Philadelphia, the logic is financial efficiency and roster balance. Committing four years of near-MVP money to a slugger in his mid-30s is risky, especially with existing large contracts on the books. Trading Schwarber gives them payroll room to strengthen pitching and defense while adding long-term value in the form of Schneider and a young arm. The Phillies also have some redundancy in corner power bats and have shown interest in distributing DH at-bats more broadly.Schwarber becomes Toronto’s primary DH, with occasional starts in left field. This reshapes the top six: George Springer, Schwarber, Guerrero Jr., Santander, Daulton Varsho, and Andres Gimenez - a group that forces opposing managers into difficult bullpen decisions due to alternating handedness and multiple 30-plus-homer threats.Toronto gains a game-changing middle-order hammer, improved lineup balance, and proven playoff power. The risks involve Schwarber’s defensive limitations, strikeout rate, and the aging curve tied to a large multiyear contract. Philadelphia, meanwhile, gains payroll flexibility, youth, and positional versatility but loses a fan-favorite slugger and must replace 40–50 homers in the near term.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Mets could acquire $15 million San Diego Padres Starter after Dylan Cease deal In the short run, Toronto likely wins the on-field upgrade.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff has declared that he will not use ChatGPT, the AI chatbot developed by Microsoft-backed AI company OpenAI . His comments came after he used Google’s latest AI model, Gemini 3.0, stating that a two-hour experience with Google’s new model has convinced him to switch permanently. Google CEO Sundar Pichai termed the Gemini 3 as the company’s “most intelligent model, that combines all of Gemini’s capabilities together so you can bring any idea to life. ”In a post on X, Benioff claimed that Gemini 3.0 has brought a monumental shift in the AI landscape. The CEO specifically praised Gemini 3’s performance across multiple modalities, noting key improvements in reasoning, speed, image quality, and video processing as the compelling factors behind his decision.“Holy shit. I’ve used ChatGPT every day for 3 years. Just spent 2 hours on Gemini 3. I’m not going back. The leap is insane — reasoning, speed, images, video… everything is sharper and faster. It feels like the world just changed, again. ❤️ 🤖”Benioff’s endorsement highlights the competitive pressure now facing OpenAI as models from rival tech giants like Google make significant advances. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and even OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman praised Pichai following the launch of Gemini 3.The xAI founder said “Congrats” on Pichai’s ""Geminiii"" announcement on X, and “Nice Work” to Demis Hassabis, the chief of DeepMind. Altman posted “Congrats to Google on Gemini 3! Looks like a great model.”Altman even noted potential “temporary economic headwinds” in an internal memo but expressed confidence in OpenAl’s rapid progress and leadership in the Al race.“We have built enough strength as a company to weather great models shipping elsewhere competition... (so), having most of our research team focused on really getting to superintelligence is critically important,” Altman wrote in the internal memo sent to employees.Stripe CEO Patrick Collison also posted on X that Gemini 3 built him an “interactive web page summarising 10 breakthroughs in genetics,” and called it “pretty cool.”Nvidia also responded to Google's stock rally, with a company stating 'We're delighted by Google's success—they've made great advances in AI, and we continue to supply them.' However, this diplomatic response came amid reports that Google's AI chips (TPUs) could potentially challenge Nvidia's market dominance, particularly after news emerged that Meta was in talks to purchase billions of dollars worth of Google's tensor processing units. Despite Google's stock hitting all-time highs and rising over 120% since April, while Nvidia's shares dipped following the competitive news, Nvidia emphasised its leadership position, noting it remains 'a generation ahead of the industry.'","Salesforce ceo mark benioff has declared that he will not use chatgpt, the ai chatbot developed by microsoft-backed ai company openai.

What Is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

Disruption will come from the unexpected





Take lessons from the dot-com era









Billionaire investor and Shark Tank judge Mark Cuban has now issued a warning to leading artificial intelligence companies including Perplexity, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft and Meta. Cuban has argued that all these companies are overspending in the race to build the world’s most powerful AI model. As reported by Business Insider, speaking in the Pioneers of AI podcast, Cuban compared today’s AI arms race to the search engine boom of 1990s. The search engine boom ultimately ended with Google dominating the market and leaving all the rivals behind.“You’ve got five, six, whatever it is, companies that are trying to create the ultimate foundational model that we all depend on,” Cuban said. “It’s almost like in the ’90s when all the search engines were competing pre-Google… Now, we know with search engines it’s Google, and then there’s Bing, as, like, 1 or 2% and DuckDuckGo has got a half a percent. So it’s effectively a winner-take-all.”Like many other world leaders and analysts, Cuban has also cautioned that the massive investments done on AI could ultimately lead to the creation of a bubble. “They may be overspending,” he said.“And if they overspend or get too caught up, the bubble is in the competition between all those models because that could pop just like that with any new technology.”Along with this, he also raised concerns about the infrastructure costs behind AI, majorly the massive and expensive data centers which are being built to power large models. “I just can’t imagine over a 10-year period that we aren’t going to improve the technology enough that if you overspend on today’s technology, it just doesn’t feel right to me,” Cuban added.Cuban also emphasised that the disruption AI will not come from incremental improvements but from something “incredible” that no one sees coming. “Somebody’s going to come up with some incredible shit, right? If I knew what it was, I’d do it,” he said, suggesting that the current race may be blindsided by a breakthrough outside the existing competition.Cuban said he recognizes the same mix of hype, excitement, and overspending now playing out in AI. “They anticipate for at least another decade spending every penny they have,” he said of the major model developers. “I mean, if that’s not ripe for disruption to come up with better ways, I don’t know what is.”","Billionaire investor and shark tank judge mark cuban has issued a warning to leading artificial intelligence companies including perplexity, openai, anthropic, google, microsoft and meta.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has revealed his annual holiday reading list as the 2025 comes to a close. Gates has recommended five books and he believes that all these titles spark curiosity and reflection during the quieter days of the winter season. “Each of these books pulls back the curtain on how something important really works: how people find purpose later in life, how we should think about climate change, how creative industries evolve, how humans communicate,” wrote Gates.In the blog post, Gates has also explained that holidays are the perfect tome to slow down and also catch up on reading. “There’s something about the quieter days around the holidays that makes it easier to sit down with a good book,” he wrote. His list on 2025 book recommendations reflects on his fascination with how the world works and how you can start a great conversation.The book belongs to the fiction genre and its a story of an aging janitor and a wise octopus captive hime with its empathy and storytelling. “Van Pelt's story made me think about the challenge of filling the days after you stop working—and what communities can do to help older people find purpose,” said Gates.The books explains about the climate challenges. The book structures 50 big questions on climate change, nuclear power and renewables. “ I’ve followed Hannah’s work at Our World in Data for years, and her new book is one of the clearest explanations of the climate challenge I’ve read. She’s realistic about the risks but grounded in data that shows real progress,” said Gates.It is a memoir which recounts the Diller’s extraordinary career in Hollywood, media, and technology, blending personal anecdotes with reflections on power, risk-taking, and the evolution of entertainment and digital industries. “He’s spent his life betting on ideas before they were obvious, and the industries he’s transformed show how much those bets can pay off,” said Gates.The book explains about the mysteries of human behaviour and how people communicate. “Although the topic itself is pretty complicated, the book is readable and practical, and it made me see everyday social interactions in a new light,” added Gate.The books offers a glimpse of at why America seems to struggle to build things and what it will take to fix that. The book argues that progress depends not just on good ideas but on the systems that help ideas spread.",Microsoft co-founder bill gates has revealed his annual holiday reading list as the 2025 comes to a close.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai on AI layoffs









Google recently launched its most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3.0. Announcing the launch of Gemini 3.0, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that it is ‘the best model in the world for multimodal understanding’. Now weeks after the intense work on Gemini 3.0, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has acknowledged that his engineers are overdue for a break. As reported by Business Insider, speaking on the Google AI” Release Notes podcast, Pichai said “I think some folks need some sleep,” adding that hopefully he and his teams “get a bit of rest” now that the milestone launch is behind them.The comment made by Pichai comes as Google is moving towards a $4 trillion market cap as the stock price of the company has surged by nearly 70% this year, including a 12% jump following Gemini 3’s debut on November 18. The Gemini 3.0 model has been widely praised for its reasoning, speed and multimodal capabilities. Recently, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff also described the Gemini 3.0 model as an ‘insane’ leap forward. He also added that after using Gemini 3.0 for two hours he will not go back to ChatGPT.After the successful roll out of Gemini 3.0, Google has managed to reclaim its frontrunner position in the AI race. Pichai noted that years of hard work of the company is the sole reason behind this success.“In 2016, I wanted the whole company to be AI-first,” he said, pointing to milestones such as the creation of Google Brain in 2012, the acquisition of DeepMind in 2014, AlphaGo’s victory in Go, and the unveiling of Google’s own tensor processing units (TPUs), which were used to train Gemini.Pichai further talked about the Google’s strategy. Pichai explained that Google always worked towards a “full-stack” approach to innovation, improving everything from infrastructure to model training and test-time compute. He admitted that when generative AI first gained traction, Google was short on capacity and had to invest heavily to scale. “If you were on the outside, it would look like we were quiet, or we were behind, but we were putting all the building blocks in place, and then executing on top of it,” he said.Recently, Google CEO Sundar Pichai talked about AI layoffs. In a recent expansive interview with BBC, Sundar Pichai pushed back against concerns that AI could eventually lead to mass job cuts. Pichai said that the tech will eliminate some jobs but also “evolve and transition” others -- ramifications that mean ""people will need to adapt.""Pichai further added that AI may be gunning for his job, but he doesn’t seem too worried about it. AI is advancing so swiftly, he said, that over the next 12 months the tech will be able to perform “complex” tasks and act as an agent on a users' behalf. ""That’s where it gets really interesting,"" he said.",Google recently launched its most-advanced ai model — gemini 3.0.

Hasan also referenced chatter from commentary channels claiming that a major sponsor previously pulled back from an award show due to concerns about his presence.This, he says, solidified his belief that certain spaces no longer want to be associated with him.In this discussion, Hasan emphasized that the shift is not about his work but about what award shows prioritize. He argued that modern creator events are built around brand partnerships andwhich reward safe, apolitical personalities. By contrast, his content routinely tackles geopolitical issues, U.S. foreign policy, and war coverage, subjects he believes make sponsors wary, regardless of his influence or audience size. He noted that his political stance has created long-term consequences for how corporate partners view him.Hasan also touched on what he described as a disconnect between audience support and industry recognition.
