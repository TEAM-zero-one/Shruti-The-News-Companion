How people are exposing themselves to scams

Signs of a romance scam

Asking for money or gifts (64%)



Using urgent or emotional language (49%)



Avoiding video calls or in-person meetings (41%)



Telling a sob story to gain sympathy (31%)



Giving inconsistent answers (24%)



Evading personal questions (20%)



Making grand promises or boasting excessively (12%)



Asking overly personal questions (11%)



UK mobile network operator EE has issued an urgent warning about the dangers of sharing personal details online, particularly when dating. The mobile network provider found that many users are giving away sensitive information too easily, putting themselves at risk of scams and impersonation fraud.According to EE’s survey of 2,000 UK phone users, an alarming 93% admitted to sharing personal details over text, messaging apps, or social media. A significant number do so while chatting with new acquaintances or online dating. With Valentine's Day heightening social interactions, EE is urging people to remain cautious.""Online dating has opened exciting new options for singles, but also a novel channel for criminals hunting for new ways to defraud their victims,"" EE stated.Research shows that one in ten (11%) people currently dating have been targeted by romance scams . Even more concerning, one in five victims lost an average of £2,500 due to these fraudulent schemes.According to The Mirror, EE’s findings revealed that 65% of users shared their phone number, 51% disclosed their location and 35% provided access to their social media profile.Additionally, 345 respondents said they had noticed suspicious behaviour from someone they were messaging, while 15% had been directly asked for money.The main danger lies in trusting people who may not be who they claim to be. Fraudsters can use personal information to impersonate victims, potentially leading to identity theft and financial loss.Even non-EE customers should stay alert. Last year, during the Valentine’s period, EE recorded a sharp rise in scam texts. In February 2024 alone, the company blocked 12 million malicious messages—well above the usual monthly average of 8.9 million. The network expects similar activity this year.""Scammers are experts at preying on the vulnerable,"" warns Richard Wainer, EE’s regulatory affairs director. ""At this time of year, when social media is full of public displays of affection, it can be tempting to turn a blind eye to the red flags, but spotting them is more important than ever"", Wainer added.To help users stay safe, EE has identified key red flags to watch out for when chatting online:EE urges users to remain cautious when communicating with people they don’t know well, especially when emotions are involved. Scammers often take advantage of trust and vulnerability, making it crucial to recognise the warning signs before it’s too late.","Uk mobile network operator ee has issued an urgent warning about the dangers of sharing personal details online, particularly when dating.

Takeaways: Tesla has sued Chinese customers and journalists and won almost every time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/takeaways-tesla-has-sued-chinese-customers-and-journalists-and-won-almost-every-time/articleshow/118180992.cms,"In this photo, Zhang Yazhou sits on the roof of her damaged Tesla Model 3 with a bullhorn outside a Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou (Image credits: AP)

Tesla did not return requests for comment. Here are some key things to know about Tesla's success in China:

Media coverage of Tesla in China is constrained

BEIJING: Tesla has embraced an aggressive legal strategy in China to stifle its critics suing its own customers.That's left some Tesla owners desperate. Zhang Yazhou protested publicly that her Model 3's brakes had failed and caused an accident in 2021 that sent her parents to the hospital. Tesla said that wasn't true and sued her for defamation. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay the $1.1-trillion company more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize for her criticism.""I refuse to accept it,"" said Zhang, who appealed the verdict. ""As a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.""As concerns mount about eroding checks and balances in the US, Tesla's record in China shows how it has thrived in a system where regulators, the courts and media all answer to the ruling Communist Party.It's not common for automakers in China or elsewhere to sue their own customers. But Tesla has done so successfully in China, where Elon Musk 's company has used the courts and the patronage of a powerful leader to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.Musk has a powerful patron in China Tesla's commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China's premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping . Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China's financial capital under his watch in 2019.With Li's support, Tesla was the first foreign automaker allowed to retain complete control over its China venture. Tesla got low-interest loans, tax breaks, favorable regulatory changes and other benefits.In January 2020, Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. That year, Tesla turned an annual profit for the first time in its history and Musk was soon declared the world's richest person.Musk's ""greater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,"" said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd, an advisory firm based in Shanghai. ""He's done a good job of it in China, and he's done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.""Requests for comment to the state council, which is run by Li Qiang, went unanswered.Tesla has had an impressive winning streak in Chinese courts Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures.The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review of public court documents and Chinese media reports by The Associated Press.Tesla won all eleven cases for which AP could determine the verdicts. Two judgments are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it has also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgments in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.While some industry experts say it's generally difficult for customers to win such cases, others say it's remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.""For Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,"" said Russo, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. ""The odds are stacked against you. It's like going to the casino and winning every hand.""In a statement to AP, the Shanghai high people's court said that judgements are the result of a ""fair trial.""""It cannot be assumed that the party has received 'special protection' or 'special treatment' because of their victory,"" the court wrote.Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.""We were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,"" a tech reporter told AP.Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk's company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. PingWest had to apologize for a report that claimed Tesla's Shanghai factory was a ""sweatshop"" and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). The AP could not determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com, which drew Tesla's ire after writing about the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla.Electric vehicle giant BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors in going after car owners who suffered crashes.""Tesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,"" said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,000) after he wrote about Tesla's alleged brake failures. ""Tesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.""","Tesla's success in china has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: li qiang, the former party boss of shanghai who is now china's premier.

Gaming industry will shut down if cos need to pay Rs 1.1 lakh crore in past GST demands: Dream11’s Jain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gaming-industry-will-shut-down-if-centre-continues-to-insist-on-rs-1-1-lakh-crore-in-gst-dream11s-jain/articleshow/118274245.cms,"NEW DELHI: Seeking an independent statutory regulator like Sebi to manage the affairs of the online gaming industry , Harsh Jain, the co-founder and CEO of the country’s most valuable gaming company Dream11, has said “the majority of companies will shut down” in case the Centre continues to insist on its notice to recover over Rs 1.1 lakh crore in GST demands, including those slapped retrospectively (stayed by Supreme Court on Jan 10).Dream11, which itself faces a Rs 28,000 crore GST demand, has said the over 400 gaming companies involved in the GST notices do not have more than Rs 10,000 crore with them to make up for the tax demand. “All the big financial numbers that you see for us are in terms of our valuations (at the time of fund raises). But valuations can’t pay taxes. The full industry will shut down if forced to pay the tax demand,” Jain told TOI.The GST Council had on October 1, 2023, imposed a 28% tax on the full face-value of player collections on online real-money gaming platforms instead of the previous 18% on the revenue of companies. In what made matters worse for the industry, the govt said that the tax will apply retrospectively, covering transactions from August 2017 to October 1, 2023.Jain, who had co-founded Dream11 in 2008 with Bhavit Sheth, says this demand is unviable and untenable.Dream11 had become a unicorn in April 2019, and was last valued at $8 billion when it raised funds in 2021. However, its financial numbers are a shade of the valuations. In fiscal FY23, Dream11’s parent Dream Sports had a consolidated revenue of Rs 6,581 crore (up 62% over Rs 4,065 crore), and profits of Rs 188 crore (up 32% over Rs 142 crore). However, its auditors had said then that the GST demand towards the company leads to a “material uncertainty which may cast significant doubt on the group's ability to continue as a going concern.”Jain said while the new GST rates are leading to a windfall for the govt, the industry is in a shambles. Moreover, the revenue and profitability of even the larger companies has been hit very badly, with not many avenues to gain from. “Govt’s collections went up from around Rs 3,000 crore (before the GST rate changes) to Rs 16,000-17,000 crore under the new GST rates and TDS. However, the industry’s revenue went down by 30-40%, and profits slipped by 60-70%.”He said even the venture capital funds dried up. “The VC money went away. Many companies have shut shop, and many lost jobs. While the Top 10 larger players are still profitable, their earnings are now down by 60-70%, and they accounted for around 90% of GST payments.”Jain said just like the creation of Sebi had led to a clean-up of the stock markets, there is a need for a similar independent body for gaming companies. “In any market, you’ll have people doing wrong things until regulators step in. We really hope that regulations come in gaming. We need a Sebi-like body for gaming. We’ve been waiting for regulations for almost two years. Hope the IT ministry starts working on this.”He said that rather than seeking higher GST collections from companies, the GST council should look at lowering rates for the platforms with the tax being charged on gross gaming revenue (GGR) and not on the full value of collections from players.Jain also spoke about offshore gaming companies, many of whom -- he claimed -- were operating illegally in the country, dodging govt taxes, and engaging in promoting betting rather than engaging in skill-based challenges.","Dream11 co-founder and ceo harsh jain is seeking an independent statutory regulator like sebi to manage the affairs of the online gaming industry.

NEW DELHI: Foreign investors have been offloading Indian equities at a rapid pace since the start of 2025, with total outflows now heading for the Rs 1 lakh crore mark.According to data by the National Securities Depository Limited (NSDL), foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) have sold equities worth Rs 99,299 crore in just six weeks.The intense selling pressure continued in February, with FPIs withdrawing Rs 13,930.48 crore in the week from February 10 to 14 alone, bringing the net outflows for February to Rs 21,272 crore so far, following a massive Rs 78,027 crore sell-off in January.The shift in foreign investor sentiment is drastic as compared to December 2024, when they were net buyers, investing Rs 15,446 crore in the equity market. However, the net buying for the entire year reduced sharply to just Rs 427 crore.The relentless selling by foreign investors has sparked concerns among market participants. Analysts attribute this trend to a combination of global uncertainties, rising US bond yields, and geopolitical tensions.An important factor driving outflows is the US President Donald Trump’s return to the White House, which has strengthened investor confidence in the American economy.Optimism around Trump's leadership and his pro-business stance have also made the US a more attractive investment destination.As a result, capital is flowing out of emerging markets, including India, as investors seek safer assets.The country saw a dramatic plunge in FPI inflows in 2024, with net investments collapsing by 99 per cent compared to the previous year.","Foreign portfolio investors (fpis) have sold equities worth rs 99,299 crore in just six weeks.

NEW DELHI: Modi government has given priority to industry and trade as it realises business plays a key role in achieving the goal of India becoming a developed nation by 2047, said labour and employment minister Mansukh Mandaviya. The taxes they pay are used for funding welfare policies that benefit everyone, especially the poor, he said.Speaking at the ET Now Global Business Summit, Mandaviya said that since 2014 India has seen ambitious aims being set and a roadmap being devised to achieve that. ""If you have a train to catch, you must reach the station in time and be on the platform in front of your coach to board it. If you are not there, the train will arrive on its scheduled time and leave without you. That is the memory I have of 1985 when I was in school and the then PM Rajiv Gandhi spoke an India of the 21st century. But there was no road map and we missed that bus then. Preparation is key. PM Modi ensured that and now we are on right track to achieving our goals,"" Mandaviya, who is also minister for sports and youth affairs said.""Modi has given a chance to the youth - which is all they needed - with his visionary programmes including ' Make in India Startup India ' and focus of self reliance.

Why Print is the eternal muscle of advertising,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-print-is-the-eternal-muscle-of-advertising/articleshow/118265497.cms,"The Alchemy of print: Awakening desire

Brand experiences, like mornings, must feel fresh

Nostalgia, aspiration, and the power of print

Advertising without print is a body without a core

Let truth prevail.

The writer is CEO, The Times of India

Over the last few weeks, three major advertising agencies released their Advertising Industry Forecasts for 2025. Across all reports, one thing remains clear: while business decisions bow before data and analytics, very well presented across all three much awaited industry reports, advertisement is more of an art than a science driven by cold numbers. Human behaviour is driven by emotions, desires, and aspirations, which drives the art of advertising. The essence of advertising, therefore, is not in mere product placement, but in the alchemy of desire, the art of turning an offering into a myth that consumers long to be part of.But where do these desires begin? Not on the fleeting glow of a screen, not in the ephemeral swirl of social media, but in the tactile, immersive world of Print. The only medium one wakes up to, the only medium that awakens desire before the first sip of morning coffee.On a digital screen, rather than as an aspiration. But advertising is not about features; it is about longing, seduction, and storytelling.Consider the moment one unfolds a newspaper in the quiet of the morning. Unlike the frantic, ceaseless scrolling of digital, where headlines evaporate as quickly as they appear, print lingers, whispers, immerses. Its experience is not an accident — it is by design.Print possesses the two primal forces of aesthetic experience: sight and touch. The grand canvas of a broadsheet allows for narrative elegance — each advertisement is a story, unmarred by pop-ups, unhurried by the tyranny of the next notification. A well-crafted print ad does not beg for attention — it commands it. Unlike digital banners, which scream for a second’s worth of engagement, a print ad is a visual embrace, an invitation to linger. And therein lies its power: it builds desire not in a flash, but in a slow-burning flame that remains.Advertising thrives on freshness — the currency of memory. Infinite repetition in digital breeds indifference. The endless scroll of ads may create awareness, but it does not build longing. Print does not repeat — it reinvents. Every morning, it reintroduces the brand with a different story, a new aesthetic, a renewed call to desire. It nurtures the consumer’s relationship with the brand like a morning ritual — familiar, yet always full of possibility.To ignore this is to misunderstand the rhythm of consumer longing. A brand, like an enduring romance, must not demand attention — it must seduce, intrigue, and unfold itself in layers.Every consumer, whether they admit it or not, wants to do things history could only dream of. Every great brand taps into this primal longing for legacy, for transcendence, for a connection between past and future. And this is where Print wields its ultimate advantage.Unlike digital, ephemeral by nature, Print creates permanence. A beautifully designed newspaper spread does not vanish; it lingers on the table, it’s folded into memory, it’s clipped and saved. It invites nostalgia, but it also speaks to futures yet to be written.This is why advertising cannot simply sell a product; it must sell a desire. It must turn an object into a story, an experience into a destiny. The brands that live forever — high end phones, luxury watches, automobiles, premium real estate or that premium travel destination — do not sell transactions. They sell tradition, elegance, and the idea that to own their product is to belong to something greater.Only Print—with its immersive, unhurried storytelling—can give this myth the status it deserves.Advertising is an exercise of power, and power must be built on a strong core. While digital may flash its brilliance, while social media may spark momentary curiosity, Print remains the foundation. It is the core muscle of advertising — unseen, yet essential; silent, yet the very thing that holds everything together. Building awareness is simple; building longing is an art.Digital awareness is instantaneous, like quick commerce — integral to modern society but fleeting. It is the surface, the introduction, the passing wave. But desire — true, deep, soul-stirring desire — is cultivated slowly, rhythmically, until it becomes inseparable from the brand itself.This is the role of Print. It does not demand attention — it earns it. It does not fight for relevance — it possesses it. It does not fade — it becomes part of the morning, part of the ritual of being alive.Let other mediums chase the moment. Print creates eternity.All three major advertising agencies predict Print to have an 18% market share in 2025, with Auto, Real Estate, FMCG, Retail and Education being major spenders. But beyond predictions, our conviction is that new-age brands seeking to build longing, longevity and legacy will still turn to Print—because in branding, the core must always be strong.And in the end, the myth of the brand and the truth of the brand must become one.","Advertising is not about features; it is about longing, seduction, and storytelling. A well-crafted print ad does not beg for attention — it commands it. Unlike digital banners, which scream for a second’s worth of engagement, a print ad is a visual embrace, an invitation to linger.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118265547,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-97238,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
WPI inflation falls slightly to 2.3% as food prices soften,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/wpi-inflation-falls-slightly-to-2-3-as-food-prices-soften/articleshow/118263134.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Wholesale price inflation eased marginally in Jan on the back of moderating food prices , indicating softening of price pressures as supplies improved.Data released by the commerce and industry ministry on Friday showed inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index (WPI) rose an annual 2.3% in Jan, softening slightly from the 2.4% in December.Positive rate of inflation in Jan 2025 is primarily due to increase in prices of manufacture of food products, food articles, other manufacturing, non-food articles and manufacture of textiles, said an official statement from the ministry. Earlier data released by the NSO showed retail inflation , as measured by the consumer price index (CI), slowed to a five-month low in Jan, aided by a softening in food prices.The data showed inflation in food articles slowed to 5.9% in Jan from 6% in the previous month. Vegetable prices , which have been stubborn, softened to 8.4%, moderating from 28.7% in the previous month. Inflation in potatoes eased a tad, rising 74.3% from 93.2% in Dec, but onion prices strengthened 28.3% in Jan from 16.8% in the previous month.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has cut rates by 25 basis points earlier this month - the first cut in nearly five years. The decision was largely led by a softening in price pressures.","Wholesale price inflation eased marginally in jan on the back of moderating food prices.

Bitter chocolate: High prices pinch pockets on Valentine's Day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bitter-chocolate-high-prices-pinch-pockets-on-valentines-day/articleshow/118263021.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: For consumers, love may have come at a cost this Valentine's Day. Chocolates, the go-to gifting choice for the season have become more expensive on the back of soaring global cocoa prices, nudging several companies to take price hikes. This essentially means that the price increases which have been taken over the past few months have now hit the markets and consumers are paying more to buy the same pack of their favourite chocolate. Amul, for instance, took a price hike of about 20%-30% for its chocolates around August 2024. ""Global cocoa prices are trending at $10,000 per metric ton. We haven't seen such price rise in the last 50 years. The situation doesn't look good but we have to live with it,"" Jayen Mehta, MD at Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation, which owns the brand Amul, told TOI. The company remains watchful of the situation, Mehta said, not ruling out further price hikes if the situation warrants. Global cocoa prices which have been on the boil for quite some time due to scarce supply reached nearly $13,000 per metric ton in December last year, hitting a record high.Chocolate prices have surged by nearly 50% compared to Valentine's Day last year, said Ashwin Rathi, chief financial officer at Smoor Chocolates. The company said that it has recorded a 100% increase in raw material costs over the past year. ""While cocoa costs have nearly doubled, we have limited the price adjustment to only 30%-40% of the total increase. We have absorbed a significant portion (of the cost increase) to ensure our products remain accessible to our customers,"" said Rathi.For Indians who love to snack on chocolates, the rise in prices comes at a time when they have already been tightening their household budgets due to inflation.Global chocolate makers like Mondelez, Hershey's and Nestle have been grappling with rising prices of cocoa. In its recent earnings, Mondelez International, the maker of Cadbury chocolates termed the cocoa cost inflation as ""unprecedented."" The company said that if cocoa prices remain elevated, more price increases may be required in the second half of 2025 and in 2026, although the attempt will be to hold on to the price points of low unit pricing (low unit packs) in ""emerging markets"" (like India).","Chocolate prices have surged by nearly 50% compared to valentine's day last year.

MUMBAI: In a setback to Digvijay Gaekwad 's plans to make a competing offer for Religare Enterprises , the Securities and Exchange Board of India ( Sebi ) rejected his application on Friday, citing a lack of proof of financial resources and terming the application as frivolous.In his application, Gaekwad, who is a Florida-based investor, had requested Sebi's exemption from strict enforcement of regulation 20 of takeover rules by allowing him to make a competing offer to acquire 55% of Religare at Rs 275 per share.Sebi said Gaekwad had ""failed to demonstrate his ability to meet the financial obligation for making the competing open offer"". It also noted Gaekwad's non-compliance with the Supreme Court order, stating that he had ""failed to deposit Rs 600 crore, as directed by the Supreme Court, which would have shown his commitment towards making the offer"". The rejection of Gaekwad's application removes a hurdle for the Burmans , the largest shareholders of Religare, who have been attempting to gain control of the company.""In the absence of adequate proof of financial resources required for making the offer, the application does not appear to be bonafide,"" Sebi said. It deemed the application frivolous and aimed at hindering the open offer process of the Burmans. As a result, it disposed of the application filed by Gaekwad. Friday's order follows Religare's announcement on the departure of its chairperson Rashmi Saluja from the company.Shareholders had voted against her reappointment, resulting in the termination of her directorship.The Burmans had made an open offer for an additional 26% stake in Religare at Rs 235 per share, but they only managed to acquire 0.26% in the open offer that closed on Thursday.","Digvijay gaekwad's plans to make a competing offer for religare enterprises rejected.

Bitcoin bull mania has gripped the crypto market once again. This time, in a meme coin format. Bitcoin Bull ($BTCBULL) just broke the $1 million milestone in its presale.The community-driven token is on a mission to give investors exposure to the BTC bull mania, which is hyped to touch $1 million and beyond. Whenever Bitcoin hits a major price milestone, $BTCBULL holders receive Bitcoin as a reward.BTC is one of the world’s most successful assets. It has registered an AAR (Average Annual Return) of 230%. For better context, the token has seen its value rise over 200 million percent since its beginning. However, most of the market missed out on BTC’s massive explosion over the years. $BTCBULL is here to alleviate the regret. With BTC expected to grow and expand further, from $100,000 to $250,000 and beyond $1 million, investors are optimistic. Increased media coverage, widespread adoption, and potential use in national reserves have strengthened the bullish narratives.With $BTCBULL, investors can join the Bitcoin movement at an affordable price. The platform hosts $BTCBULL and $BTC airdrops that coincide with the key price milestones of Bitcoin.True, BTC has experienced multifold growth over the years and most investors can’t afford to pay $100,000 to buy a Bitcoin. But $BTCBULL gives the community exposure to BTC’s growth at small costs.$BTCBULL has a total supply of 21 billion tokens, while BTC has a total supply of 21 million. $BTCBULL has implemented a built-in deflationary model to bring more scarcity into the tokenomics over time.The burning mechanism is designed to drive the value of the token by taking advantage of the inverse relationship between price and supply. It rewards long-term $BTCBULL investors by creating upward price pressure through increased demand.Exciting $BTCBULL airdrops or burns are activated every time $BTC hits a new price milestone. For example, when the BTC price hits $100,000 after the $BTCBULL presale sell-out, the token will make its debut exchange listing. When the Bitcoin price hits $125,000, a token burn goes live, and when it touches $150,000, a BTC airdrop will go live.Being built on the Ethereum blockchain using the EVM standard, the token is more conducive to adoption and trading than BRC-20 tokens.While BRC-20 tokens demand Bitcoin-native wallets that are complex to handle for everyday investors, Ethereum wallets offer seamless trading. Although $BTCBULL is an Ethereum token, the rewards are compatible with multichain wallets. After the presale sell-out, the token will be listed on leading crypto exchanges .With a multichain wallet, $BTCBULL holders can receive $BTC and $BTCBULL airdrop rewards.

Although it has been just days since the presale launched, the community is fast-growing.

It also imposed significant financial penalties on app store operators and internet hosting providers that continued to distribute or support TikTok.According to The New York Times, TikTok executives expressed optimism during a briefing call on Tuesday that Apple and Google would soon reinstate the app. H. Lee Justine, a TikTok creator and author who participated in the call, confirmed the statement.""They said that the administration had given them a lot of information that they wouldn't be penalized and that they were really hopeful that any day now they would put it back in the app stores,"" she said in an interview.""It makes me very hopeful that they felt that they could do this because hopefully this means that long term there's not going to be issues and this will work out,"" she added.Despite Apple and Google preventing new TikTok downloads, previously installed versions continued functioning normally on American devices.TikTok's reinstatement on app stores is a promising development, granting the company until early April to secure a buyer. This marks a dramatic turnaround—just a month ago, it faced a ban with strong bipartisan support in Congress.

Thomson Reuters wins AI copyright battle in US against Ross Intelligence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/thomson-reuters-wins-ai-copyright-battle-in-us-against-ross-intelligence/articleshow/118231116.cms,"Thomson Reuters has secured an early legal victory in the ongoing debate over fair use in AI-related copyright cases. The media and technology company sued Ross Intelligence—a now-defunct legal research firm—in 2020, alleging that it unlawfully used content from its legal platform, Westlaw, to train an AI model without authorisation.Judge Stephanos Bibas of the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled a decision on Tuesday that Ross Intelligence was not entitled to use Thomson Reuters' content under US copyright law to develop a competing platform.According to the Associated Press, Bibas, in the summary judgment, concluded that ""none of Ross's possible defenses holds water"" and ruled in Reuters' favour regarding the ""fair use"" matter.Under US law, the ""fair use"" doctrine permits limited use of copyrighted materials for purposes such as teaching, research, or creating a transformative work.In an email to WIRED, Reuters' representative Jeffrey McCoy expressed satisfaction with the verdict, stating that: “We are pleased that the court granted summary judgment in our favor and concluded that Westlaw’s editorial content created and maintained by our attorney editors, is protected by copyright and cannot be used without our consent,” he wrote. “The copying of our content was not ‘fair use.’”Reuters' victory emerges amidst an increasing number of legal challenges initiated by creators, artists and music companies against AI system developers over comparable concerns.The common thread in these legal disputes is the allegation that technology firms utilised vast collections of human-authored content to train their AI systems for generating text that mimics human writing, without seeking authorisation or offering payment to the original content creators.OpenAI and its commercial partner Microsoft are facing copyright infringement lawsuits from renowned authors, including John Grisham, Jodi Picoult, and ""Game of Thrones"" creator George R.R. Martin, as well as separate legal challenges from major media outlets such as The New York Times, the Chicago Tribune, and Mother Jones.","Thomson reuters has secured an early legal victory in the ongoing debate over fair use in ai-related copyright cases.
