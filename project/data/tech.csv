Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal gave a reality check to India's startup ecosystem by comparing them with their Chinese counterparts at the second Startup Maha Kumbh here Thursday and exhorting the former to step up their game.Showing a slide comparing the countries, the minister said Indian startups are busy making ""food delivery apps, fancy ice cream & cookies, instant grocery delivery, betting & fantasy sport apps and reels & influencer economy."" On the other hand, the startups in China are working on ""EV & battery tech, semiconductors & AI, robotics & automation, global logistics & trade and deep tech & infrastructure.""He also said the Indian startup ecosystem needed more domestic capital, instead of foreign entities buying stake in the same. For this, unicorns and industry can create a fund. ""Grow and maintain your ownership. I feel sad when I come to know that for Rs 25 lakh or Rs 50 lakh a bright idea of a young start-up got sold to a foreign company. Let's try and get some more domestic capital coming into this ecosystem,"" he said.""India has the largest number of STEM graduates passing out every year.

Keeping your customers satisfied is more of a survival strategy in Schedule 1 than a goal. The use of appropriate mixing formulae for the best Strains is crucial. Players are not allowed to become very comfortable in this drug simulator because when they do, their clients will become irate, which will cause the cash deposits to decrease even faster.Knowing how to combine ingredients in the right way for making the best strains to maximize profit is the secret formula. The stakes increase as you move closer to the mid- to endgame. Fortunately, the secret recipes of the best strains in the game which you'll need are included in this guide.Here are the best strains and their ingredients:~$185 (negotiable up to $200+)The “OG” in the name of the strain truly stands out for it as it is the very first ever strain mix in the game we got to unlock. Your NPCs love it and it’s a good salad scaling early-game because of its low-ingredient cost and decent margins.Furthermore, this blend could serve as an escaping tool in case players find things going south. While players might question whether other could have become the game's top earners since the patch, such as Green Crack, the general consensus is that OG Kush is still the best strain in schedule one. This strain gives the consumers anti-gravity and glowing effects.$165 base, up to $200 with negotiationsThis strain has a 100% Addiction rating, making it among the highest rated in the game. The downside is that the right ingredients take grinding before you can sell it. However, until you get there, once you start selling, the NPC gets addicted quickly and you get to reap the benefits.~$160Though not as strong as the Green Crack-based strains, it’s still a good mid-game option. The consistent customer demand provides a secure source of income, and it can be a substitute for the premium-grade ingredients if you’re running low.$140–$160 per unitThis strain is a reliable option—not the most eye-catching or the most costly, but it provides consistent sales at little cost of concern.

Trump says next taxes a “declaration of economic independence”

The technology sector suffered particularly heavy losses due to the newly-imposed substantial reciprocal tariffs by US President Donald Trump with Magnificent Seven – Apple , Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Tesla, Nvidia and Facebook parent Meta – hit the most, a report has said.According to news agency Reuters, about $760 billion in market capitalisation was lost by these companies cumulatively within hours of the trading session's close, with Apple among the hardest-hit.Apple led a significant downturn among major technology companies, plunging nearly 6% in extended trading. Should Apple's after-hours losses carry through to Thursday's regular trading session, it would mark the company's most severe single-day decline since September 2020, CNBC said.The iPhone maker, whose revenue predominantly relies on devices manufactured in China and several other Asian countries, faced the most substantial decline. Manufacturing hubs in China and Taiwan faced tariffs exceeding 30%, resulting in a staggering total tariff of 54% on imports from China.Nvidia shares dropped approximately 4% amid concerns about its Taiwan-based chip manufacturing and Mexico-assembled AI systems. Tesla also suffered, with its stock falling 4.5% in after-hours activity. The selloff extended across other technology giants, with Alphabet, Amazon and Meta experiencing declines between 2.5% and 5%. Microsoft showed more resilience but still fell by almost 2%.Trump said the new tariffs on imported goods will be a “declaration of economic independence” for the US. He announced a 10% blanket tariff on all imports, and higher duties for specific countries based on what tariffs they charge on US exports, Trump highlighted.“We will supercharge our domestic industrial base, we will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers. Ultimately, more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers,” Trump said.","Magnificent seven – apple, microsoft, alphabet, amazon, tesla, nvidia and facebook parent meta – hit the most.

"Uber’s policy change in Pune gives auto drivers control over fares, commuters hassled",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/ubers-policy-change-gives-auto-drivers-control-over-fares-commuters-hassled/articleshow/119882153.cms,"Uber's new autorickshaw service model has caused confusion among Pune commuters, as suggested fares on the app are now negotiable

PUNE: Jayesh Koloti, a resident of Wanowrie, booked an autorickshaw last week via Uber platform to travel to Pune airport.""The fare on the platform showed Rs 220. After I boarded the auto, the driver started the meter, which generally doesn't happen when one books a ride on aggregator platforms. Once I reached my destination, the auto driver told me to pay the meter fare, which was Rs 260. I was taken aback, and he told me that regulations had changed,"" Koloti said.With Uber having changed its regulations pertaining to autorickshaw rides from its platform, several commuters are confused and hassled. According to the new regulations, which came into effect in March this year, the auto fare to a destination reflected on the platform of Uber would only be suggestive, and the commuter and the auto driver must decide on the final fare. Further, Uber said it won't charge auto drivers any commission, and the fare should be paid to the driver via cash or UPI.An Uber spokesperson told TOI that the autorickshaw rides via the platform shifted to a new service model called Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). ""Given the industry's shift towards subscription-based model for drivers, we have decided to align our approach accordingly so as not to be at a competitive disadvantage,"" an Uber spokesperson said, adding that the same model had not been implemented yet for cabs.A spokesperson for ride-haling platform Ola, however, said that the drivers on its platform are expected to charge customers the fares shown on the app. ""There is no change in our policy yet,"" the spokesperson said.Vinay Pawar, who booked a ride on Uber app to travel from Vimannagar to Shivajinagar Metro station, said the auto driver refused to accept the fare of Rs 170 shown on the ride-hailing platform. He also refused to go by the meter. ""the driver quoted a fare of Rs 350, citing new regulations. When I requested him to go by the meter, he refused and told me to cancel the ride, which led to an argument,"" he said.Udayan Tajani, a resident of Koregaon Park, said the RTO-approved fares needed to be synced with Uber platform. ""The only advantage of booking rides on aggregator platforms is that one does not have to hunt for autorickshaws. Last week, I travelled from Koregaon Park to Kalyaninagar in Uber auto. Though the fare on the Uber platform showed Rs 60, the driver demanded Rs 140. Auto drivers in general don't want to confirm shorter trips. I was forced to pay the money as I was in a hurry,"" Tajani, a working professional, said.""Recently, I booked an auto on Uber platform to travel from Pune railway station to Lullanagar. The fare shown on the platform was Rs 100. However, once I boarded the auto, the driver told me to pay Rs 250. When I requested him to go by the meter, he refused to do so, citing the new change in regulations. Auto drivers have been fleecing customers for a long time, but no action is taken against them. It is time that RTO should step in,"" said Sathish Jaikar, a bank employee.Autorickshaw unions said they are aware of the situation. ""We have started a campaign and requested all autorickshaw drivers to go by the meter and not fleece customers. In many of the autos, information about changed Uber policy has been put up so that passengers know about the changed rules,"" Keshav Kshirsagar, president, Baghtoy Rickshawala union, told TOI.Attempts to contact Pune RTO officials failed to elicit any response.","Uber's new autorickshaw service model has caused confusion among pune commuters.

US president Donald Trump on Friday showed off the new Gold Card worth $ 5 million and said that it would be available ""in about less than 2 weeks"".When asked by the reporter who was the first buyer, Trump said, ""I am the first buyer"".""For $5 million this could be yours... it will be out in about less than 2 weeks probably. Pretty exciting, right?"" he said as he showed the Gold Card with his face on it.Trump introduced this new plan to offer Gold Cards to affluent foreign nationals in February this year, providing them with US residency and a route to citizenship. He projected that the initiative could generate trillions in revenue and contribute to lowering the national debt.“It’s somewhat like a green card, but at a higher level of sophistication. It’s a road to citizenship for people, and essentially people of wealth or people of great talent,” he had said.With a price tag of $5 million, the Gold Card program is set to replace the EB-5 immigrant investor visa . Established in 1990, the EB-5 program allowed immigrants to obtain green cards by investing a minimum of $1 million in a business—or $800,000 in a low-income area—that created at least 10 jobs. In 2024, over 4,500 EB-5 visas were granted.In return, holders receive residency benefits similar to those of Green Card holders, granting them the right to live and work in the United States. While the program offers a pathway to citizenship, the specific timeline and procedural details have not yet been fully disclosed.The initiative is designed to replace the EB-5 program, which has faced criticism for inefficiency and fraud.

Macquarie Equity Research has put an ‘underperform’ rating on Vodafone India with a target price of Rs 6.50. Analysts feel the government’s decision to convert the company’s obligations due in FY26 to equity reiterate the government’s supportive intent for a three-player market, but they expected timeline extensions instead of equity dilution. With underlying free cash flow generation for VodaIdea still inadequate, they maintained their guarded stance.Elara Securities India has put an ‘accumulate’ rating on Hindalco Industries with a target price of Rs 734. Analysts feel that in the long run the company may witness margin expansion in its domestic business, driven by operational benefits from coal mines and a higher share of value-added products. For Novelis, margin growth would be supported by operating leverage, contract repricing, and cost-saving initiatives. As most margin drivers are likely to materialize beyond FY27, we retain our earnings estimates and our target price.Emkay Global Financial Services has downgraded Dabur to ‘reduce’ rating with a reduction in target price to Rs 450 from Rs500 earlier, mainly due to weak business execution. Analysts said Dabur in its recent business update noted a mid-single-digit decline in the domestic business, which is a key business concern in our view. While Dabur has been focusing on share gains across most segments, they see a need for aligning with the evolving consumption trend, for topline recovery. Consolidated revenue is likely to be flat in Jan-Mar 2025 quarter, while margin is likely to see compression, which will drive a low double-digit decline.JM Financial has initiated its coverage of Inox India with a ‘buy’ rating and a target price of Rs 1,240. Analysts said that the company is India’s largest manufacturer of cryogenic equipment, a dominant player, about four time the size of its nearest competitor. Its key strengths include over 30 years of expertise in engineering and design, quality management, and testing, an impeccable execution track record, and most globally required certifications in place, all of which make it a preferred supplier for its clients.Nirmal Bang Securities has given a buy recommendation on Sky Gold & Diamonds with a target price of Rs 482. The company specialises in design, and manufacturing of casting gold jewellery for large and mid-to-small jewellers. Among its top clients are Malabar, Joyalukkas, Kalyan, Reliance, Senco, PN Gadgil and CaratLane. Analysts feel since the industry is shifting towards large B2B suppliers, the company is in a sweet spot. While the market is large, a small base provides for multi-year growth opportunities. It’s also preparing to tap new opportunities with new products.

The Indian negotiators and the electronics industry is hoping that New Delhi will be able to manage to get lower tariffs from the US during BTA talks, especially when it comes to exports of value-added products, such as smartphones, as govt positions itself as a 'trusted manufacturing ally' for the US.""Also, support from corporations, such as Apple, Microsoft and Google, may be sought as they may be roped in as key partners to reinforce India's pitch during BTA negotiations with Trump administration,"" a key industry official told TOI.Electronics industry fears that if tariffs on India continue to remain at 27% for smartphones and other allied products then there is a ""chance that companies start setting up new manufacturing units"" in countries with lower tariffs.""The shift to low tariff countries may happen to arrest impact of high manufacturing costs, which threaten to fuel inflation and thus reduce consumption in US,"" the official said. Key industry associations of electronics are alerting govt on need to maintain guard on emergence of competing manufacturing locations beyond China and Vietnam. ""Several developing countries have secured lower tariff rates compared to India, including Brazil, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, UAE (each at 10%), and the Philippines (17%). Saudi Arabia and UAE represent near-term threats to India's electronics exports due to SEZs, competitive manufacturing environments and potential labour-cost advantages,"" Indian Cellular & Electronics Association said.""Brazil's favourable tariff treatment, despite historical trade barriers, adds to strategic ambiguity and warrants careful monitoring."" When it comes to Samsung, the company has been hit hard after the US slapped a 46% tariff on Vietnam, which is the Korean electronics major's biggest manufacturing base. (Samsung's exports from Vietnam to the US and other key regions are estimated at around $55 billion)This, industry analysts say, may make it ""more profitable and easier"" for Samsung to scale up its smartphone manufacturing base in India. Samsung officials are understood to be in a huddle at the moment, weighing options.","Us president donald trump's tariff announcements may end up giving india a larger share in global smartphone production from apple and samsung.
