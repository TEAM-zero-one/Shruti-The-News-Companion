India's billion plus stories will fuel economic growth: PM Modi,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indias-billion-stories-will-fuel-eco-growth-pm-modi/articleshow/120803193.cms,"Dream big & tell your story: PM to creators & investors



MUMBAI: Today, when the world is looking for new ways of storytelling, India with its ""timeless treasures"" can help build an Orange Economy of content, creativity and culture, PM Modi said at the World Audio Visual Entertainment Summit (WAVES) in Mumbai Thursday.Stressing on the event's potential as a platform for entertainers and investors to connect and collaborate, he said it could transform India into the world's third-largest economy.The arc of Indian cinema beginning with Dadasaheb Phalke's Raja Harishchandra in 1913, the PM said, has widened over the years with the popularity of Raj Kapoor in Russia, Satyajit Ray at Cannes and the Oscar-winning RRR.The creative economy 's contribution to GDP is set to increase significantly, he said.India is not only home to a billion-plus population, but also a billion-plus stories,” said the PM, adding that every street in the country has a story, every mountain carries a song, and every river hums a tune. Cautioning against potential dehumanisation resulting from technological advancements in the creative industries, Modi stressed the necessity of retaining emotional depth and intellectual richness in expression.Advising creators and investors to “dream big and tell your story”, he urged them to invest in people, not just platforms. “We must not turn humans into robots; instead, we must make them more enriched and sensitive,” he said, noting that genuine progress should factor in the arts—including music, dance and painting — not just information, technology, or speed.As an example, Modi cited the $430-billion global animation market which is projected to double in the next decade. The PM said this presents a significant opportunity for India’s animation and graphics industry, which could leverage the expansion for greater reach. “Indian films have now reached audiences across the globe. Today, Indian films are screened in more than 100 countries. Foreign audiences are not just watching Indian films but also trying to understand them. A notable aspect of Indian cinema is that many international viewers are watching Indian content with subtitles. India has become a global hub for film production, digital content, gaming, fashion, and music,” he said, pointing to the tenfold growth in the OTT segment in recent years.India is a world leader in global fintech adoption and the second-largest mobile manufacturer, he added, showing the way forward in other areas such as the creative fields. He also noted Indian cuisine’s global popularity and expressed confidence in similar recognition for Indian music — ‘Khaana’ is becoming popular worldwide; similarly, ‘gaana’ also has tremendous potential for growth, said Modi.The Centre has now allocated Rs 400 crore to build the first Indian Institute of Creative Technology (IICT) in Mumbai, a decision that was reiterated by Information and Broadcasting minister Ashwini Vaishnaw at the event. IICT is all set to become a national hub for the Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics, and Extended Reality sector. Work on the institute has already commenced. “IICT has aligned with a few tech giants for collaborative efforts towards courses. These include NVIDIA, Google, Apple, Microsoft, Meta, Star India, and Adobe,” said Vaishnaw. Maharashtra CM Devendra Fadnavis said Mumbai’s Film City, spread over 500 acres, is being developed into a global centre for next-generation studio ecosystems. Of this, 120 acres will be dedicated to a media and entertainment city focused on animation, visual effects, and gaming, he added. IICT is being established by the I&B ministry, in strategic collaboration with FICCI and CII, as a national Centre of Excellence on the lines of IITs and IIMs.Modi also unveiled postage stamps in memory of Gurudutt, P Bhanumathi, Raj Khosla, Ritwik Ghatak, and Salil Chowdhury on the occasion for their contributions to Indian cinema.","India with its ""timeless treasures"" can help build an orange economy of content, creativity and culture, pm modi said at the world audio visual entertainment summit in mumbai.

Who is Chandra Holt? Former Walmart exec in spotlight as Kohl’s CEO Ashley Buchanan fired over vendor deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-chandra-holt-former-walmart-exec-in-spotlight-as-kohls-ceo-ashley-buchanan-fired-over-vendor-deal/articleshow/120807119.cms,"Chandra Holt (L) is now at the center of a corporate scandal involving her former Walmart colleague, and reported former romantic partner, Ashley Buchanan(R).

Corporate ties and shared history

Fallout at Kohl’s

What’s next for Holt?

Chandra Holt, once considered one of the most promising executives in American retail, is now at the center of a corporate scandal involving her former Walmart colleague, and reported former romantic partner, Ashley Buchanan .Buchanan was fired this week as CEO of Kohl’s after the company accused him of engineering a vendor deal riddled with “undisclosed conflicts of interest.”According to a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission, Buchanan directed Kohl’s to enter into a multimillion-dollar contract with a vendor that allegedly had “highly suspicious” and “favorable” terms. The filing did not name the vendor or the individual involved, but The Wall Street Journal identified the woman as Chandra Holt.In a statement to The Journal, Holt confirmed she had known Buchanan for a decade but denied any business wrongdoing. “I’ve known Ashley Buchanan for 10 years, but I have not received any compensation for my Incredibrew business from Kohl’s,” she said.Holt is the founder and CEO of Incredibrew, a coffee brand she launched in 2022 that claims to infuse beverages with vitamins and minerals. It remains unclear whether Incredibrew was the vendor involved in the Kohl’s deal under scrutiny.Buchanan and Holt first crossed paths at Walmart, where they worked closely before departing around the same time for other executive roles. Buchanan left in early 2020 to head arts-and-crafts giant Michaels, while Holt exited in 2021 to become CEO of Conn’s HomePlus.Most recently, she served as CEO of Beyond, Inc, the parent company of Overstock.com and Bed Bath & Beyond, between February 2024 and June 2024.Her impressive résumé includes leadership stints at Target, Sam’s Club, and Walgreens. She holds a Bachelor of Arts in advertising, PR, and communications from the University of Minnesota, Twin Cities, and an MBA in strategy and marketing from the Carlson School of Management.Buchanan’s exit comes amid a challenging period for Kohl’s. The company reported a 7.2% drop in annual sales to $15.4 billion and announced plans to close more than two dozen underperforming stores. The firing triggered serious consequences: Buchanan must now forfeit all equity awards granted during his tenure and repay a prorated portion of his $2.5 million signing bonus.While Kohl’s emphasized that the CEO's termination had “no bearing on the company’s financial performance,” the incident adds turbulence to a company already struggling with leadership instability . Buchanan was the third CEO in as many years, following short-lived tenures by Tom Kingsbury and Michelle Gass.Although no formal allegations have been made against Holt, her name is now linked to a boardroom controversy that could complicate her professional path. With her leadership record and entrepreneurial success through Incredibrew, the coming months may determine whether Holt can distance herself from the scandal or whether her past with Buchanan will cast a longer shadow.","Chandra holt is now at the center of a corporate scandal involving her former walmart colleague, and reported former romantic partner, ashley buchanan.

Shannon Sharpe's bodyguard shady tweet, no receipts, and a whole lot of internet chaos

“watch Katt back and you’ll understand.”

Katt Williams' Club Shay Shay interview is getting dragged into the rumor spiral



Club Shay Shay

No confirmation, no evidence, just wild speculation with no names behind it



You know it’s a wild day online when Shannon Sharpe , Diddy, and Katt Williams all end up in the same conspiracy theory. A now-deleted tweet, allegedly posted by Sharpe’s bodyguard, has set social media ablaze with claims that Shannon met his current partner at a Diddy party when she was just 17. But here's the twist, the tweet can't be found anywhere now, no one’s verified who wrote it, and the internet is spiraling over screenshots that may not even be real.So here’s how it all started: someone claiming to be Shannon Sharpe’sdropped a bombshell on X (formerly Twitter), writing,The tweet didn’t stop there it ended with a mysterious line:The post quickly made its way around stan accounts and gossip pages. But just as fast as it popped up, the tweet disappeared. There’s no verified account connected to it, no backup from known reporters, and as of now, no screenshot from a reliable source. Some are even saying the tweet never existed and was just cooked up to stir drama.The “watch Katt back” part? That’s what really got people going. It’s a direct reference to Katt Williams’ viral appearance on Sharpe’s podcastearlier this year, the same interview where Katt claimed he declined party invites from Diddy and hinted at “industry weirdness.”But let’s set the record straight: Katt never mentioned Shannon Sharpe in that context. He threw shots at plenty of names, but Sharpe wasn’t one of them. Still, folks online are connecting dots that just aren’t there, especially since Katt and Sharpe have actually remained on good terms since the episode aired.Despite the online explosion, there’s absolutely zero evidence backing this tweet. Shannon Sharpe hasn’t responded (and likely won’t), and no credible outlets have touched the story. This feels a lot more like fan fiction than fact.And since the tweet’s gone and wasn’t posted from a verified account, there’s no way to know if it ever existed in the first place. What we’re left with? A bunch of viral whispers, half-screenshotted “proof,” and a lot of people making reckless allegations based on deleted posts.Also read - Who is Gabriella Zuniga?

In a landmark modernization effort, the US Social Security Administration (SSA) is preparing to roll out a secure, digital method for Americans to access their Social Security numbers (SSNs) online. Starting in early summer 2025, individuals with a My Social Security account will be able to view their SSNs directly through the SSA portal.This initiative is aimed at reducing reliance on traditional paper-based cards, cutting wait times for replacements, and enhancing user convenience and security. The move reflects SSA’s broader goal of adapting to digital trends while safeguarding sensitive personal information in an increasingly cyber-connected world. As identity theft and administrative backlogs continue to pose challenges, this digital SSN access marks a critical shift in how Americans interact with their most essential federal identification number.Historically, Americans have had to rely on physical Social Security cards for documentation of their SSN. If a card was lost or stolen, individuals were required to request a replacement either by mail or in person—a process that could take days or even weeks. With this new enhancement, users of the My Social Security platform will be able to view their SSN online via smartphone or computer at any time.The SSA has confirmed that the digital SSN service will become available in early summer 2025. No specific date has been announced, but the rollout is expected to be nationwide and accessible to all users with verified My Social Security accounts.Despite this digital advancement, the SSA emphasizes that physical SSN cards will continue to be available for those who prefer or require them. Individuals who are less familiar with technology or need a paper version for specific institutions can still request and receive a card through traditional channels.The digital SSN feature is especially helpful for:Lee Dudek, SSA Acting Commissioner, stated:The initiative is part of a broader trend of federal agencies moving services online in an effort to reduce paperwork, cut administrative costs, and provide faster access to essential services.While this change only allows users to view their SSN, experts note that it may pave the way for broader digital identity services in the future. Such services could include digital versions of other federal IDs or benefits information, enabling more seamless interactions with government systems.To ensure the integrity of this new service, the SSA has incorporated a range of cybersecurity protections:The SSA advises users to:",Digital social security cards launching soon by ssa.

"UPS to lay off 20,000 jobs, shut down facilities as it reduces Amazon shipments",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ups-to-lay-off-20000-employees-shut-down-facilities-as-it-reduces-amazon-shipments/articleshow/120739052.cms,"What UPS said about the 20,000 job cuts



“The actions we are taking to reconfigure our network and reduce cost across our business could not be timelier. The macro environment may be uncertain, but with our actions, we will emerge as an even stronger, more nimble UPS.”

""The world hasn't been faced with such enormous potential impacts to trade in more than 100 years,""

""These actions will enable us to expand our US Domestic operating margin and increase profitability.”

“Amazon is our largest customer but it’s not our most profitable customer. Its margin is very dilutive to the U.S. domestic business,”

“Due to their operational needs, UPS requested a reduction in volume and we certainly respect their decision.”

United Parcel Service (UPS) has announced its plans to cut nearly 20,000 jobs and close 73 facilities by the end of June. This move comes after the biggest package delivery company in the world decided to sharply cut back on the shipments from its largest customer, Amazon . The company announced that it expects the job cuts to take place this year and the facility closures, across both leased and owned sites, by June 30. UPS is still reviewing its network and may identify additional locations for shutdown. As per FactSet data, the company employs about 490,000 workers. The upcoming job cuts will reduce UPS’ workforce by slightly over 4%. This decision follows the company's announcement to cut 12,000 positions last year.In a statement to the news agency Reuters, a UPS spokesman said the job cuts reflect a 50% reduction in shipping volume from Amazon, its largest customer, combined with broader cost-cutting and efficiency initiatives as part of a major operational restructuring.On the other hand, union's general president Sean O'Brien told Reuters, ""UPS is contractually obligated to create 30,000 jobs under its current national master agreement with Teamsters. But if the company intends to violate our contract or makes any attempt to go after hard-fought, good-paying Teamsters jobs, UPS will be in for a hell of a fight.""In its recent regulatory filing, the company said that cuts are in ""connection with our anticipation of lower volumes from our largest customer.”UPS CEO Carol Tome said:This decision follows a slowdown in economic growth and mounting recession fears driven by Trump’s aggressive trade policies.Tome noted during the company's latest earnings call.UPS CFO Brian Dykes added:In January, UPS agreed with Amazon to reduce the volume it handles by more than 50% by the second half of 2026. Speaking on the fourth-quarter earnings call, Tome noted that after nearly 30 years of partnership, the renewal of Amazon’s contract this year prompted a reassessment of the relationship.Tomé said at the time.Meanwhile, an Amazon spokesperson said to Reuters:In related news,","United parcel service (ups) has announced its plans to cut nearly 20,000 jobs and close 73 facilities by the end of june.

Bangladesh Currency Crisis: Bangladesh faces currency crisis as central bank halts issuing notes featuring Mujibur Rahman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-faces-currency-crisis-as-central-bank-halts-issuing-notes-featuring-mujibur-rahman/articleshow/120714882.cms,"Approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused

DHAKA: The central bank of Bangladesh has apparently incurred a huge financial loss due to the interim govt’s decision not to issue previously printed notes, with approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remaining unused. The decision aligns with govt’s efforts to diminish Bangabandhu’s presence in public memory.Although bank officials are unwilling to discuss the matter publicly, many, on conditions of anonymity, said the longstanding tradition of obtaining new notes from Bangladesh Bank has been abruptly halted, creating a crisis in the market. On the one hand, the printed money is being wasted without use; on the other hand, customers are suffering as a result, they added.“Notes of various denominations are printed using paper and ink purchased with people’s taxes. Millions of notes with Bangabandhu’s picture are still lying in the vaults of various banks. The Security Printing Corporation does not have the capacity to cancel all the notes at once and print new ones. Therefore, notes with Bangabandhu’s picture cann’t be suddenly cancelled,” Ziauddin Ahmed, former executive director of Bangladesh Bank and former managing director of Security Printing Corporation, told reporters.In this situation, he suggested the printed notes be circulated in the market to alleviate public suffering. “When new design notes come into the market, the old ones should be gradually withdrawn. Generally, notes printed once can be used for a maximum of four to five years,” Ahmed said.According to media reports, Bangladesh Bank is unable to issue new notes to banks in line with demand. The crisis became evident following the country’s political upheaval in Aug last year.Since all forms of currency, including metal coins, feature Mujibur’s image, Bangladesh Bank abruptly stopped issuing new notes early April. As a result, the notes featuring Bangabandhu’s image are not reaching the market. Shops, banks, and citizens are now left with torn and old, dirty notes.According to sources at Bangladesh Bank, the Security Printing Corporation is set to begin printing new design notes next month. In the first phase, new design notes of 20, 50, and 1,000 taka will be printed and subsequently released in the market through banks.","Approximately taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused.

"AI can trick you, warns book that hid AI's help writing it",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/ai-can-trick-you-warns-book-that-hid-ais-help-writing-it/articleshow/120805711.cms,"Andrea Colamedici invented a philosopher, presented him as an author and produced a book, secretly generated with the help of artificial intelligence , about manipulating reality in the digital age. People were deceived. Accusations of dishonesty, bad ethics and even illegality flew. But the man behind it, Colamedici, insists it was not a hoax; rather, he described it as a "" philosophical experiment ,"" saying that it helps to show how AI will ""slowly but inevitably destroy our capacity to think.""Colamedici is an Italian publisher who - along with two AI tools - generated ""Hypnocracy: Trump, Musk, and the Architecture of Reality,"" a buzzy text ostensibly written by Jianwei Xun, the non-existent philosopher. In Dec, Colamedici's press printed 70 copies of an Italian edition that he supposedly translated. Still, the book quickly gained outsize attention, being covered by media outlets in Germany, Spain, Italy and France, and being cited by tech luminaries.""Hypnocracy"" describes how powerful people use technology to shape perception with ""hypnotic narratives,"" putting the public in a kind of collective trance that may be exacerbated by relying on AI.The book, Colamedici said, was meant to show the dangers of ""cognitive apathy"" that could develop if thinking were delegated to machines and if people don't cultivate their discernment. ""I tried to create a performance, an experience that is not just the book."" Colamedici teaches what he calls ""the art of prompting,"" or how to ask AI smart questions and give it actionable instructions, at the European Institute of Design in Rome. He tries to teach users how to discern fact from fabrication.The book is an extension of this effort, he said. The AI tools he used helped him to refine the ideas, while clues (real and invented) about the fake author, intentionally suggested potential problems to prompt readers to ask questions, he said. The first chapter discusses fake authorship, for example, and the book contains obscure references to Italian culture unlikely to come from a young philosopher from Hong Kong, which eventually helped to lead one reviewer to the true author operating as a translator. Sabina Minardi, an editor at Italian outlet L'Espresso, picked up on the clues, exposing Jianwei Xun as a fake in early April. Colamedici then updated the fake author's bio page, spoke to publications, including some deceived by his work. New editions and excerpts come with postscripts about the truth.But some who first embraced the book now question whether Colamedici has acted unethically or broken a EU law on AI. French news outlet Le Figaro wrote about ""L'affaire Jianwei Xun,"" explaining the ""problem"" with its earlier interview of the Hong Kong philosopher was that ""he doesn't exist."" Spanish newspaper El Pais retracted a report, replacing it with a note that said ""the book failed to acknowledge AI's involvement in the creation of the text, a violation of the new European AI Act."" Colamedici is disappointed some initial champions have decried the experiment. He said he plans to have Jianwei Xun - describing it as a collective of humans and artificial intelligence - teach a course about AI next fall.

(AP photo)

Tesla's board members contacted multiple executive search firms approximately a month ago, seeking potential candidates to succeed Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk , according to a report by the Wall Street Journal, which cited sources familiar with the discussions.The Wall Street Journal reported that the Tesla board's initiative was triggered by Elon Musk's substantial engagement with the Donald Trump administration, though the current progress of this succession planning effort remains unclear.In a recent development last week, Musk announced his intention to substantially reduce his involvement with the Trump administration and increase his focus on managing Tesla.Musk's leadership at the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), focusing on reducing federal positions, remains a contentious element of Trump's administration. His reduced presence at Tesla has worried shareholders, particularly as the company faces declining sales of its existing electric vehicle range.Also Read | Elon Musk’s Tesla refunds early India bookings, leases office space: Signs of India entry soon? According to a Reuters report, Musk’s alignment with right-wing political groups across Europe has sparked demonstrations against both Musk and Tesla, resulting in damage to company facilities and charging points throughout America and European nations.According to the WSJ report, directors convened with Musk, requesting him to make a public statement confirming his increased commitment to Tesla's operations.The report indicated uncertainty regarding Musk's - who serves on the board - awareness of succession strategies, or whether his commitment to increase involvement with Tesla has influenced these plans.In response to global competitive pressures, Musk has shifted focus from developing an affordable electric vehicle platform to emphasising autonomous taxis and humanoid robots, positioning Tesla as an artificial intelligence and robotics enterprise rather than a traditional car manufacturer.The company's market value majorly relies on this strategic direction, with some shareholders expressing confidence that Trump's influence will support this vision. Recently, federal authorities relaxed autonomous vehicle testing regulations, resulting in a positive impact on Tesla's share price.According to the WSJ, certain Tesla board members, including co-founder JB Straubel, have engaged with significant investors to provide assurance regarding the company's management.Also Read | ‘India a very hot market but...’: Elon Musk-led Tesla says 100% car tariffs make customers anxious","Elon musk recently announced his intention to increase his focus on managing tesla.

Gold loans double in a year even as credit growth slows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gold-loans-double-in-a-year-even-as-credit-growth-slows/articleshow/120805037.cms,"Mumbai: Indians are pledging more gold than ever. Outstanding bank loans against the precious metal more than doubled in the year to March 2025, rising 103% from just over Rs 1 lakh crore to nearly Rs 2.1 lakh crore, RBI data showed. The surge made gold loans the fastest-growing segment, even as overall bank credit growth slowed to 11% in FY25 from 20% in the previous year.Several forces drove this boom. In 2023, RBI directed banks to reclassify many agricultural loans as loans against gold jewellery, inflating the numbers. Typically, banks benefit by categorising rural gold-backed loans as agricultural credit as farm loans carry lower interest rates and relatively lenient repayment terms.Further impetus came after RBI restricted gold lending by a few large non-bank finance companies, pushing more borrowers towards traditional banks. A steep rise in gold prices also enhanced borrowing capacity, as lenders offer funds against the value of jewellery pledged.Despite the spike in gold loans, overall credit expansion lost steam. Outstanding bank credit stood at Rs 182 trillion at the end of March 2025.While the merger of HDFC with HDFC Bank distorted the base, even adjusted growth slowed to 12% from 16.3% in the previous year. Large industry remained a drag, with credit growth to the sector dipping slightly to 6.2% from 6.4% in FY24.The composition of bank lending continued to shift. Industry's share fell further to 21.5%, while services rose to 28.3%. Personal loans accounted for 32.6% of all credit, up marginally from 32.4%, helped by the jump in gold loans. The share of housing loans remained steady at 16.5%. Loans against gold jewellery now make up 1.1% of total bank credit, nearly doubling their share from 0.6% a year ago.Besides gold loans, the second fastest-growing segment was loans against securities, which grew 18.7% to Rs 10,080 crore. Consumer durables were the only category in the retail segment to see a dip, shrinking 1.3% to Rs 23,402 crore. This drop was largely because many lenders reviewed their exposure to unsecured personal loans. Housing loans accounted for 16.5% of personal loans with a portfolio of Rs 30.1 lakh crore. 'Other personal loans', which largely reflect unsecured loans, grew by 7.9%.","Bank loans against the precious metal rose 103% from just over rs 1 lakh crore to nearly rs 2.1 lakh crore.

"Lend, baby, lend: Borrowers getting younger",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/lend-baby-lend-borrowers-getting-younger/articleshow/120804563.cms,"MUMBAI: When HDFC began offering home loans in the late 1970s, credit was a privilege, accessed cautiously and late in life. A large downpayment was a prerequisite, and only those in their 40s, with years of savings, could typically afford to borrow. Today, credit is accessed much earlier and more casually, with a growing number of Indians starting their credit journey in their mid-20s.The average age at which Indians avail their first credit product has fallen by 21 years across three generations, a study by Paisabazaar showed. K Cherian Varghese, former chairman of Corporation Bank, who began his banking career five decades ago says that the ability to borrow is directly linked to the size of disposable income. "" Personal loans are taken either to finance purchase of some asset like home loan or for consumption. In the 70s, the disposable income was not enough to service the loan EMIs. Today, in many jobs like IT, the employees get a decent salary that allows them to meet all expenses and repay their EMIs,"" said Varghese. He adds that today banks have pre-approved many corporate employers and are willing to provide a suite of credit products to their employees making credit much more accessible.While the credit bureau made it easier for lenders to identify delinquents, the Jan Dhan-Aadhaar-Mobile trinity made it easier to keep track of borrowers. The study, which is based on the credit behaviour of over 10 million consumers, showed that those born in the 1960s began borrowing at 47, largely through secured loans like mortgages. In contrast, individuals born in the 1990s typically enter the credit ecosystem by the age of 25-28, often through unsecured products such as credit cards, personal loans, and consumer durable loans.This shift reflects the broader trend of easier access to credit and a changing consumer mindset - one that values instant gratification over prolonged savings. While the first credit card in India was launched by Central Bank with Mastercard in the early 80s, it was a very highly restricted product. The card was offered largely to tax-paying high earners. It wasn't until Citi, SBI and ICICI started offering cards to a wider audience that cards picked up.The study traces how the entry point into the credit system has evolved. For those born in the 1960s, home loans were the first credit product. For the 1970s and 1980s cohorts, auto loans became the preferred starting point, availed at average ages of 39 and 31, respectively. The average age for a first-time home loan borrower has declined from 41 (for those born in the 1970s) to 28 (for the 1990s-born).","When hdfc began offering home loans in the late 1970s, credit was a privilege.

Maruti Suzuki was on top of the list.Mahindra emerged as the second-biggest in April, with wholesale dispatch of 52,330 units (28% growth). The company is driving strong with its set of SUVs, such as ScorpioN, Thar and XUV range, while also gaining some numbers with newly-launched electrics XEV9e and BE6. At 45,199 units, Tata Motors (down by 6%) was ranked third, a shade higher than Hyundai's 44,374 units (-12%).This is not the first time that Mahindra overtook Hyundai. The Indian company, which posted a revival of sorts over the past few years, with new aggressively designed premium SUVs, was the second-biggest seller in Feb this year.Both Hyundai and Tata Motors, which have a full line-up of cars (hatchbacks, sedans, and SUVs), are under pressure due to the general slowdown in the domestic car industry that is impacting compact cars. The sedan category has also been in decline over the past few years.With an SUV-only range, Mahindra is relatively safe as the off-roader category still continues to find buyers and grow.Industry analysts say ""reversals in rankings may continue to happen"" over the next few quarters as Mahindra, Hyundai, and Tata will keep challenging each other. ""The rankings may continue to shift among the three companies over the coming months,"" an analyst said.An official with a car company said these are wholesale numbers and many companies are also trying to ""right-size"" their dealer inventories. ""Otherwise, they will have to clear pending stocks with heavy discounts later, if the market continues to stay tough.""Rajesh Jejurikar, executive director & CEO of Mahindra's automotive and farm divisions, recently told TOI that the company has a clear focus on maintaining its volume and value leadership in SUVs, while driving in new ""adventure-ready"" off-roaders. ""For us, revenue market share is a more critical metric, and so is having the top position in SUVs. And in this process, if we also become the No. 2 PV player during certain periods, that's clearly an added bonus for us. ""The first month of the fiscal year also saw Toyota, Kia, Skoda, and JSW MG register growth.

Goldman Sachs has a ‘buy’ recommendation on Trent with the target price at Rs 6,970. Analysts said the company’s margins came in better than expected by them. They said while the weak gross margin possibly indicated higher than usual discounting during the end-of-the-season sales, operating costs were well below estimates, leading to an operating margin expansion. Some operating costs in the Jan-March quarter were unusually low. Also, the management mentioned that the full year profitability is more representative of the business.Motilal Oswal Financial Services has put a ‘buy’ rating on Varun Beverages with a target price of Rs 665. Analysts believe the company maintained its volume growth trajectory in the domestic market and its expansion in international markets, with the integration in South Africa progressing well. Management is confident about its double-digit growth guidance on the back of industry tailwinds and expansion into new markets every year via the addition of visi-coolers (in domestic and international markets).Elara Securities India has reiterated its ‘accumulate’ call on Ambuja Cements with the target price unchanged at Rs 616. Analysts believe the cement major is well-positioned to deliver healthy volume growth, led by better demand, ramp-up in acquired assets and completion of ongoing capacity expansions.Additionally, while the recent uptick in cement prices will support near-term margin, its continued focus on cost saving initiatives should help keep a check on margin in the medium term. Sub-par demand, weak cement price and a sharp rise in fuel price are key risks to the analysts call.InCred Equities has maintained its ‘add’ recommendation on Aditya Birla Sunlife AMC with the target price at Rs 800 but removed it from its high-conviction stocks list. Analysts believe that the company is taking the right steps for improving market share. However, they see the competition is intensifying, along with volatile capital markets, which seem to be weighing down on equity fund market share movement and SIP inflow. Key downside risks are low traction in new funds and a higher employee attrition rate.Emkay Global Financial Services has a ‘buy’ rating on Adani Green with a target price of Rs 1,500. Analysts said the company reported an uptick in operational capacity and improvement in Capacity Utilization Factor, leading to high growth in sale of power. Book realization was stable on a quarterly basis, while share of merchant cum infirm rose. The management highlighted that the rains impacted Khavda project work in FY25, thus slowing capacity addition to 3.3GW, though FY26 guidance is healthy at 5GW, with 1GW likely to be commissioned within a month.","Goldman sachs has a ‘buy’ recommendation on trent with the target price at rs 6,970.
