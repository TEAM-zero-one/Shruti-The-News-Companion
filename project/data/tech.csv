More docking in mid-March

BENGALURU: India will not build a large rocket for its planned crewed mission to the Moon, but instead rely on multiple launches and satellite docking technology , as per Isro’s current plans for the mission targeted for 2040.“One option is to build a huge rocket and take a single module. But what will you do with that rocket thereafter? Economically, we have to understand and really look at all aspects. So, we are not going to build a huge rocket. We are going to have multiple modules. Maybe right now, our thinking is two modules. You take them separately and dock,” Isro chairman V Narayanan told TOI in an exclusive interview.The approach builds on India’s recent success with the Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX) mission, which achieved its first docking manoeuvre on Jan 16. The mission involved two 220-kg satellites initially separated by 11 km, orbiting at approximately 28,400 km per hour.Docking technology is crucial for India’s upcoming space initiatives, including the planned space station project comprising five modules, and the crewed lunar mission . The space station modules too will be launched separately and assembled in orbit, with the first module already receiving govt approval.The technology Isro is developing through SpaDeX will provide valuable insights for future crewed Moon landing missions. While the successful first docking marked a milestone, Isro will conduct multiple manoeuvres at various orientations to thoroughly understand the dynamics involved. Each iteration will provide new insights that will inform the development of future space systems.Narayanan, who took charge as Isro chairman on Jan 13, explained the complexity of the docking process: “Imagine two buses going on the road with each traveling at 100 kilometre per hour speed…And if both have to be get docked, you know, lot of things has to be done. Number one, you have to come exactly within millimetre level.”The satellites, which were previously controlled independently, now function as a single unit. The next phase involves establishing power transfer between the modules, a crucial step for future missions including Chandrayaan-4, where multiple docking operations will be required.While Isro has completed the first crucial docking manoeuvre, SpaDeX will continue for an extended period. “The satellites are currently in an elliptical orbit, where power generation varies based on position. This is not a one-time operation. We’ll conduct multiple docking attempts to demonstrate our capability to perform the procedure reliably and repeatedly beginning mid-March,” Narayanan said.The key objectives are to evaluate: How precisely Isro can execute multiple docking maneuvers, how well the algorithms perform under various conditions, how the integrated inertial systems function and how the propulsion system performs during repeated operations.“This is truly a multidisciplinary endeavor. Through these multiple trials, we will generate extensive data to support future applications. Before conducting any actual experiments, we thoroughly test everything in our ground simulator. We validate our understanding and approach through simulation first, then proceed with the real operation only when we are fully confident. This careful approach is essential to prevent any mistakes,” he said.Isro’s methodical approach involves gathering extensive data to refine the technology for future applications. While the initial docking marked a milestone, Narayanan indicated that the mission would continue for an extended period, with numerous experiments planned to master this complex capability.",India will not build a large rocket for its planned crewed mission to the moon. Isro’s current plans for the mission are targeted for 2040.

Bengaluru space firm tests payload in extreme cold conditions in space,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bengaluru-space-firm-tests-payload-in-extreme-cold-conditions-in-space/articleshow/118398381.cms,"BENGALURU: Space startup GalaxEye, which earlier this year completed analysis of the data from the payload it had deployed and tested aboard Isro’s PSLV Orbital Experiment Module (POEM) platform — on the rocket that launched India’s Space Docking Experiment (SpaDeX) mission on Dec 30, 2024 — has achieved another success.The firm, its CEO and co-founder Suyash Singh confirmed to TOI, has successfully tested its SyncFusion Imaging System, which was part of the payload on POEM, in one of the most extreme environments in orbit—the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA), a region where Earth's magnetic field is unusually weak.“The POEM platform was going through SAA and we had an opportunity to activate our payload and repeat our test sequence. We weren’t certain of success since it was essentially a prototype payload. There was some uncertainty involved. We’d met our primary objectives the previous month. However, this time we wanted to test under extreme conditions, it’s about -10°C there,” Singh told TOI.The success has prompted the firm to consider testing the payload another time. “SAA has an extreme cold temperature, we’ll now also try to do it on the other side of the temperature, which is in the extreme heat conditions as well. Temperatures could be as high as 150°C,” Singh said.Earlier, the firm had said that its ‘GLX-SQ payload’ onboard POEM was the world’s first fusion of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical imagery in orbit.“Our payload demonstrates an unprecedented capability to merge SAR and optical imaging technologies, enabling unprecedented insights for defence, agriculture, and disaster management applications. The system’s most remarkable feature is its ability to process and compress massive data volumes in less than 10 minutes, delivering real-time, actionable solutions,” the firm said.Singh said this was not just a technological milestone, but the beginning of a journey to redefine the possibilities of remote sensing and space-based solutions.Leveraging Isro’s POEM platform, which converts a PSLV rocket’s fourth stage into an orbital testbed, GalaxEye validated its advanced technologies in a real-world space environment. The successful mission sets the stage for the company’s upcoming Mission Drishti, a flagship multi-sensor satellite project aimed at providing all-weather, high-resolution imaging.Founded in 2021, GalaxEye’s goal is to build the world’s first multi-sensor satellite capable of delivering comprehensive, high-resolution data across various industries.",Galaxeye has successfully tested its syncfusion imaging system in one of the most extreme environments in orbit.

How people are exposing themselves to scams

Signs of a romance scam

Asking for money or gifts (64%)



Using urgent or emotional language (49%)



Avoiding video calls or in-person meetings (41%)



Telling a sob story to gain sympathy (31%)



Giving inconsistent answers (24%)



Evading personal questions (20%)



Making grand promises or boasting excessively (12%)



Asking overly personal questions (11%)



UK mobile network operator EE has issued an urgent warning about the dangers of sharing personal details online, particularly when dating. The mobile network provider found that many users are giving away sensitive information too easily, putting themselves at risk of scams and impersonation fraud.According to EE’s survey of 2,000 UK phone users, an alarming 93% admitted to sharing personal details over text, messaging apps, or social media. A significant number do so while chatting with new acquaintances or online dating. With Valentine's Day heightening social interactions, EE is urging people to remain cautious.""Online dating has opened exciting new options for singles, but also a novel channel for criminals hunting for new ways to defraud their victims,"" EE stated.Research shows that one in ten (11%) people currently dating have been targeted by romance scams . Even more concerning, one in five victims lost an average of £2,500 due to these fraudulent schemes.According to The Mirror, EE’s findings revealed that 65% of users shared their phone number, 51% disclosed their location and 35% provided access to their social media profile.Additionally, 345 respondents said they had noticed suspicious behaviour from someone they were messaging, while 15% had been directly asked for money.The main danger lies in trusting people who may not be who they claim to be. Fraudsters can use personal information to impersonate victims, potentially leading to identity theft and financial loss.Even non-EE customers should stay alert. Last year, during the Valentine’s period, EE recorded a sharp rise in scam texts. In February 2024 alone, the company blocked 12 million malicious messages—well above the usual monthly average of 8.9 million. The network expects similar activity this year.""Scammers are experts at preying on the vulnerable,"" warns Richard Wainer, EE’s regulatory affairs director.

China's Tencent says trialling own AI reasoning model alongside DeepSeek,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinas-tencent-says-trialling-own-ai-reasoning-model-alongside-deepseek/articleshow/118326869.cms,"Chinese technology giant Tencent

BEIJING: Chinese technology giant Tencent on Monday said it had started trialling its own artificial intelligence reasoning model after integrating DeepSeek into some of its products, saying the move would make responses ""more 'human'"".Insurgent Chinese AI startup DeepSeek made global headlines last month when it unveiled its R1 chatbot that can seemingly match American competitors at a fraction of the cost.Since then, a series of major Chinese companies have said they will integrate DeepSeek's technology into their products.On Monday, Tencent said in a post on WeChat, the social media platform it owns, that selected users of its Yuanbao chatbot may address queries to either DeepSeek or its homegrown AI reasoning model "" Hunyuan Thinker "".""With the support of two deep reasoning models, the question-answering is more professional, the reasoning is more powerful, and the writing is more 'human',"" Tencent said of the beta testing rollout.Tencent, which also operates the QQ messaging app and is a major player in online gaming, has sought to capture a larger share of the burgeoning AI market in China.The Shenzhen-based company is understood to have started exploring the integration of DeepSeek into multiple products, with some users of the domestic version of WeChat noting the addition of an AI search function on Sunday.A Tencent spokesperson confirmed to AFP that the domestic app, which has over a billion monthly active users, had ""recently started beta testing access to DeepSeek"".The move intensifies competition in China's internet search sector after tech titan Baidu said Sunday it would weave DeepSeek into its market-leading search engine to ""enrich a more diversified search experience"".Last week, Chinese electric-vehicle giant BYD said it would integrate DeepSeek's software into its cars, following other domestic automakers like Geely, Great Wall Motors and Leapmotor.Despite its rise to prominence at home, DeepSeek has drawn scrutiny in some countries over its collection and handling of users' personal data.South Korea became the latest jurisdiction to remove the chatbot from app stores on Monday pending a security review, following similar moves in Italy, Taiwan, Australia and some US states.","Chinese technology giant tencent has started trialling its own artificial intelligence reasoning model.

Takeaways: Tesla has sued Chinese customers and journalists and won almost every time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/takeaways-tesla-has-sued-chinese-customers-and-journalists-and-won-almost-every-time/articleshow/118180992.cms,"In this photo, Zhang Yazhou sits on the roof of her damaged Tesla Model 3 with a bullhorn outside a Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou (Image credits: AP)

Tesla did not return requests for comment. Here are some key things to know about Tesla's success in China:

Media coverage of Tesla in China is constrained

BEIJING: Tesla has embraced an aggressive legal strategy in China to stifle its critics suing its own customers.That's left some Tesla owners desperate. Zhang Yazhou protested publicly that her Model 3's brakes had failed and caused an accident in 2021 that sent her parents to the hospital. Tesla said that wasn't true and sued her for defamation. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay the $1.1-trillion company more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize for her criticism.""I refuse to accept it,"" said Zhang, who appealed the verdict. ""As a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.""As concerns mount about eroding checks and balances in the US, Tesla's record in China shows how it has thrived in a system where regulators, the courts and media all answer to the ruling Communist Party.It's not common for automakers in China or elsewhere to sue their own customers. But Tesla has done so successfully in China, where Elon Musk 's company has used the courts and the patronage of a powerful leader to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.Musk has a powerful patron in China Tesla's commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China's premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping . Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China's financial capital under his watch in 2019.With Li's support, Tesla was the first foreign automaker allowed to retain complete control over its China venture. Tesla got low-interest loans, tax breaks, favorable regulatory changes and other benefits.In January 2020, Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. That year, Tesla turned an annual profit for the first time in its history and Musk was soon declared the world's richest person.Musk's ""greater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,"" said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd, an advisory firm based in Shanghai. ""He's done a good job of it in China, and he's done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.""Requests for comment to the state council, which is run by Li Qiang, went unanswered.Tesla has had an impressive winning streak in Chinese courts Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures.The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review of public court documents and Chinese media reports by The Associated Press.Tesla won all eleven cases for which AP could determine the verdicts. Two judgments are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it has also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgments in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.While some industry experts say it's generally difficult for customers to win such cases, others say it's remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.""For Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,"" said Russo, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. ""The odds are stacked against you. It's like going to the casino and winning every hand.""In a statement to AP, the Shanghai high people's court said that judgements are the result of a ""fair trial.""""It cannot be assumed that the party has received 'special protection' or 'special treatment' because of their victory,"" the court wrote.Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.""We were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,"" a tech reporter told AP.Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk's company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. PingWest had to apologize for a report that claimed Tesla's Shanghai factory was a ""sweatshop"" and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). The AP could not determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com, which drew Tesla's ire after writing about the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla.Electric vehicle giant BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors in going after car owners who suffered crashes.""Tesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,"" said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,000) after he wrote about Tesla's alleged brake failures. ""Tesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.""","Tesla's success in china has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: li qiang, the former party boss of shanghai who is now china's premier. Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it has also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118181303,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-809598,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Vietnam's strict new social media regulations strangle free speech,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/vietnams-strict-new-social-media-regulations-strangle-free-speech/articleshow/118357094.cms,"Representative image

BANGKOK: New government regulations on social media in Vietnam give authorities increased powers to prevent dissent and control the news, along with the tools to more easily track down critics and silence them, according to an analysis released Tuesday.Vietnam's authorities implemented ""decree 147"" in December, tightening regulations on social media companies like Facebook, X, YouTube and TikTok in a bid to further stifle criticism, said Ben Swanton, one of the authors of the report by The 88 Project, a group focused on human rights and free speech issues in Vietnam.""Any challenge to the government and the Communist Party, any significant challenge to their official narrative of events, is perceived by them as a situation that is getting out of control,"" he said in an interview from Thailand.Among other things, the decree requires users to verify their accounts with phone numbers or national ID cards that must be provided to the government upon request, and for the social media companies to store their data in Vietnam.It also prevents social media users from engaging in citizen journalism or posting information about suspected government wrongdoing, and requires companies to remove posts deemed illegal within 24 hours. The decree requires companies to allow authorities access to their internal search engines so that it can identify offending content.Social media companies have until late March to be in compliance, and it is not yet clear whether they will try to push back. TikTok and Facebook refused to comment on their plans, while X and Google, which owns YouTube, did not return emails.Already, however, researchers have noticed a decline in political posts, Swanton said.""In the last several years Hanoi has imprisoned or forced into exile the country's most prominent independent journalists, reformers, human rights activists, and dissidents. This has had a chilling effect that encourages people to engage in self-censorship,"" he said. ""Decree 147 is designed to turn this chilling effect into an icy stranglehold on free speech.""Vietnamese authorities did not respond to a request for comment on the Project 88 analysis or the intent behind the new decree.Authorities tighten the screws on critical reportingAbout 65 million Vietnamese have Facebook accounts, roughly two-thirds of the population, and some 35 million have YouTube accounts. About half of Vietnam's people say they get most of their news from social media.Already, the government frequently insists critical posts from outside the country be geo-blocked so they cannot be accessed inside Vietnam and it has moved quickly to censor posts it deems unacceptable, like a video of a top minister eating a gold-encrusted steak in London in 2021 while Vietnam was on Covid-19 lockdown.In October, a prominent Vietnamese blogger was sentenced to 12 years in prison for articles and videos exposing the corruption of government officials, and in January, a prominent Vietnamese lawyer was sentenced to three years in jail for Facebook posts criticising the country's former top judge.Project 88 researchers said the new decree will also give authorities better tools to go after those who just read or watch social media posts as well.They noted a case last June in which police in one province went through the profiles of 13,328 members of a Facebook group that had information deemed ""hostile to the state"" and identified 20 people in their province, went to their homes and demanded they leave the group.""If implemented as intended, decree 147 would likely make it less time consuming to identify members of groups like this and ensure that groups with anti-state content will be blocked in the country,"" the report said.It urges social media companies and others affected to refuse to comply with provisions of the decree that violate free expression rights, and for the United States and United Nations to pressure Vietnam to repeal the measure.","Vietnam's authorities implemented ""decree 147"" in december, tightening regulations on social media companies. The decree requires users to verify their accounts with phone numbers or national id cards.

Boost for ‘Make in India’! iPhone parts maker looks at supply chain shifts toward India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/boost-for-make-in-india-iphone-parts-maker-looks-at-supply-chain-shifts-toward-india/articleshow/118385699.cms,"Apple has been expanding production beyond China. (AI image)

Murata Manufacturing Co., a producer of iPhone components, is considering relocating some production facilities to India, signalling a shift in global supply chains towards the world's largest population centre.Apple has been expanding production beyond China, recently initiating trial production of AirPods in India. Additionally, numerous Chinese mid-range smartphone manufacturers are anticipated to establish facilities in India, attracted by its substantial workforce and growing consumer expenditure.According to a Bloomberg report, Murata, the Kyoto-based manufacturer of multilayer ceramic capacitors anticipates increased demand in India and is analysing potential investment scenarios in the region, according to company President Norio Nakajima .Nakajima explained that whilst their newest capacitors are primarily manufactured in Japan, clients are requesting increased overseas production, partly for business continuity considerations.Murata's components are essential in virtually all electronic devices, including Apple Inc. and Samsung Electronics Co. mobiles, Nvidia Corp. servers and Sony Group Corp. gaming systems. The firm has also contributed to NASA's Mars helicopter project. Currently, Japan produces nearly 60% of their MLCCs, though this figure is expected to decrease to approximately 50% in coming years, according to 63-year-old Nakajima. Murata leads globally in supplying capacitors, which manage power distribution to electronic components.Responding to customer movements and support from Narendra Modi's administration, Murata has secured a facility in OneHub Chennai Industrial Park in Tamil Nadu, planning to commence capacitor packaging and distribution in the fiscal year beginning April 2026. The company has committed to a ¥1 billion ($6.6 million) five-year lease to evaluate long-term market potential before considering a comprehensive manufacturing facility, according to Nakajima.Infrastructure limitations in India currently prevent Murata from establishing a complete production facility, particularly due to power supply concerns, according to Nakajima. However, the company aims to develop some capacity there to align with their customers' production shifts and respond to growing electronics demand, as well as potential future manufacturing incentives, the Bloomberg report said.Nakajima indicated that whilst India expansion plans are underway, Murata does not intend to set up manufacturing units in the US. This decision stems from their capacitors being primarily incorporated into products assembled in Asia before being shipped to American markets.Although Trump's reciprocal tariffs policy has sparked internal discussions at Murata, their primary worry centres on the broader economic implications. Nakajima expressed concern that widespread consumer goods price increases could adversely affect capacitor orders.Murata anticipates steady annual smartphone shipment growth of up to 3%, driven by emerging markets' preference for low and mid-range devices. Nakajima highlighted that faster growth is expected from AI server demand. This outlook has contributed to a 15% rise in Murata's share value since their February quarterly results announcement.The company, recognised as a key indicator of gadget demand, forecasts global smartphone production to reach 1.18 billion units in fiscal 2024, representing a 3% year-on-year increase.","Murata manufacturing co. a producer of iphone components, is considering relocating some production facilities to india.

But then we got hit with COVID, and we had to solve that problem, because I was doing it — and now I said, I want to come back and do the recipri- — because every country in the world almost — we have a deficit with almost every country — not every one, but just about, pretty close.

And — but every country in the world takes advantage of us, and they do it with tariffs. They makes — make it — it’s impossible for him to sell a car, practically, in, as an example, India. I don’t know if that’s true or not, but I think —

MR. MUSK: The tariffs are like 100 percent import duty.

THE PRESIDENT: The tariffs are so high —

MR. MUSK: Yeah.

THE PRESIDENT: — they don’t want to — now, if he built the factory in India, that’s okay, but that’s unfair to us. It’s very unfair.

And I said, “You know what we do?” I told Prime Minister Modi yesterday — he was here. I said, “Here’s what you do. We’re going to do — be very fair with you.” They charge the highest tariffs in the world, just about.

Q 36 percent?

THE PRESIDENT: Oh, much — much higher.

MR. MUSK: It’s 100 percent on — auto imports are 100 percent.

THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, that’s peanuts. So, much higher. And — and others too. I said, “Here’s what we’re going to do: reciprocal. Whatever you charge, I’m charging.” He goes, “No, no, I don’t like that.” “No, no, whatever you charge, I’m going to charge.” I’m doing that with every country.

MR. MUSK: It seems fair.

Tesla’s India Plans

Tesla India entry : Days after PM Narendra Modi met Tesla CEO Elon Musk, US President Donald Trump has said that any potential plans by the EV maker to build a factory in India would be ‘very unfair’. Trump's comments came as part of a conversation with Elon Musk on Sean Hannity's programme.During the interview, the US President, who commenced his second term in January, highlighted his persistent stance on global exploitation of the US through tariffs. He said, ""...every country in the world takes advantage of us, and they do it with tariffs. They makes — make it — it's impossible for him to sell a car, practically, in, as an example, India. I don't know if that's true or not, but I think —""Musk verified this by saying, ""The tariffs are like 100% import duty,"" to which Trump concurred, describing the tariffs as ""so high.""Both Musk and US President Donald Trump have in the past expressed concerns about India's steep import duties on automobiles.A White House fact sheet indicates that India levies a 100% tariff on US motorcycles, whilst the US imposes merely 2.4% on Indian motorcycles.Trump further elaborated, ""Now, if he built the factory in India, that's okay, but that's unfair to us. It's very unfair.""Also Read | 'More of white noise': Why Trump’s reciprocal tariffs on India’s exports to US will have a ‘limited’ impact Tesla appears to be making concrete steps towards introducing its electric vehicles to India. Following a recent meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Elon Musk in the US, Tesla has begun advertising retail positions in Mumbai Sources told TOI that the initial phase will involve importing vehicles for sale through retail outlets in Mumbai and Delhi.This development appears to signal a serious intent from Tesla to establish operations in India, following years of tentative discussions.

These include a store manager position to oversee sales operations, suggesting plans for a showroom. The company is also seeking staff for delivery operations and customer support. Previously, Tesla had recruited some staff in India but had to terminate their employment when plans were suspended.Tesla, which has been evaluating Indian market opportunities for several years, is anticipated to utilise the EV policy with planned investments between $2 and $3 billion. The company previously indicated its intention to produce an affordable EV in India, targeting a price range of Rs 25-30 lakh, with plans for regional exports. The government views Tesla's proposals favourably, particularly following Apple's successful iPhone manufacturing and export operations in India.Last year's introduction of a new scheme to attract EV manufacturing investments was widely viewed as specifically targeting Tesla. The initiative offered reduced import duties of 15% for electric vehicles if manufacturers invested a minimum of $500 million and commenced production within three years. Companies could import up to 8,000 vehicles annually at this reduced rate.The recent Union Budget's decision to reduce import duty from 100% to 70% on vehicles priced above $40,000 (approximately Rs 35 lakh) may have further influenced Tesla's strategy.Although the basic customs duty decreased by 30%, the replacement of the 10% Social Welfare Surcharge with a 40% Agriculture Infrastructure and Development Cess (AIDC) maintained the overall tax burden.",Both musk and us president donald trump have in the past expressed concerns about india's steep import duties on automobiles.

This will allow the company to import 8,000 cars annually at a highly-subsided 15% customs duty (against 110% now), only after it commits to invest Rs 4,150 crore (little less than) $500 million for a local factory, with additional domestic value addition (DVA) mandates.""There is excitement and nervousness in investment departments of key states as they scurry to attract the Tesla investments. The plan is to approach the company management as soon as possible and begin negotiations, including giving out any special benefits,"" a source said.Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra are already key automobile manufacturing hubs, and so is Gujarat where many companies have invested over the past decade. All three have an edge as they provide easier access to the port, seen as a must for Tesla's India factory, which will also be an export hub .In its initial plan to govt, the company had said that it plans to set up a 5 lakh capacity plant where it would invest between $2 billion and $3 billion.
