NEW DELHI: Leader of Opposition Rahul Gandhi on Saturday called for a ""ground-level change"" to make India a true manufacturing power. He said under the name of ‘ Make in India ’, the country is merely assembling products and not actually manufacturing them.In a post on X, formerly known as Twitter, he said, “Do you know that 80% of the components of most TVs made in India come from China? In the name of ‘Make in India’, we are merely assembling, not truly manufacturing. From iPhones to TVs – the parts come from abroad; we just put them together.""The Congress leader also pointed out at the structural issues and said, “Small entrepreneurs want to manufacture, but there's neither policy nor support. On the contrary, heavy taxes and the monopoly of select corporates – which have gripped the country's industry.”Gandhi also focused on the fact that unless India becomes self-reliant in production, discussions around jobs, growth, and ‘Make in India’ will remain “mere speeches.” He said, “Ground-level change is needed so that India moves beyond the assembly line to become a true manufacturing power and can compete with China on equal footing.”In his earlier speeches, Gandhi had cited government data to argue that ‘Make in India’ has failed to revive the manufacturing sector, noting, “India’s manufacturing share in GDP has fallen from 15.3% in 2014 to 12.6%, the lowest in 60 years.”Highlighting the urgency for policy overhaul, Gandhi had earlier said, “China has been working on batteries, robots, motors, and optics for the last ten years, and it has at least a ten-year lead on India in this space.”“As the world stands on the brink of a technological and economic revolution, India needs a new vision for growth, production, and participation, one that directly addresses our two biggest challenges: the job crisis and the lack of opportunity for 90% of Indians.”“Jobs come from production, which Make In India has failed to revive. But we have an opportunity with the revolution in energy and mobility, with renewable energy, batteries, electric motors and optics, and AI to bring these together. India must master a central role in this revolution, and boost production to give our youth hope for the future,” he had said.","Rahul gandhi on saturday called for a ""ground-level change"" to make india a true manufacturing power.

A hard-hitting account of discrimination and challenges faced by Indian passport holders while travelling internationally, shared by a content creator, has sparked a conversation online.The post was shared by Instagram user @jaystravelblog, who shared a heartfelt note on the silent burden of travelling with an Indian passport. The post begins with “The ugly side of travel I had to come across as an Indian passport holder who loves travelling. It’s not in the guidebooks…It’s in the stares. The silence. The paperwork that makes you prove your humanity”.The creator recounted the emotional toll of having to justify short trips to embassies, often spending more time securing visas than planning the actual journey. “A border control officer, with a 3-second glance, can make me feel like a threat — before I’ve even said a word,” he noted.“Every time I hand over my passport, I also hand over the burden of assumptions,” he wrote, highlighting the constant questions and doubts that accompany travellers from developing countries like India.The account reflected on how rejections are often delivered without explanation, leaving behind feelings of humiliation and helplessness.“We dress a certain way. Speak softer. Carry more documents. Plan escape routes through countries that are ‘easier,’” he wrote, describing the silent strategies employed to navigate bias.Online reactions have poured in support for the user and praised his candid narrative, describing it as a long-overdue conversation. One user wrote, “This is such a needed post! Thank you for writing this. As a fellow travel enthusiast, this hits hard"".The post ends with a message of solidarity. “For every Indian traveller who has felt humiliated, delayed, dismissed — I see you. And I hope someday we don’t have to fight to prove we simply want to explore.”","Instagram user @jaystravelblog shared a heartfelt note on the silent burden of travelling with an indian passport.

Strahan steps in as a star power guest shark

Can Strahan swim with the Sharks? Corcoran thinks so

Michael Strahan is officially headed to Shark Tank, and the excitement started inside the Tank itself. As news of his guest role broke, longtime investor Barbara Corcoran wasted no time jumping in. Her swift, three-word reaction on Instagram said more than any press release could. It was the kind of instant approval that only a true Shark can give.Within minutes of the announcement, Corcoran left her mark in the comments: “Incredible! Can’t wait (along with a red-heart emoji)” The red heart wasn’t just emoji fluff—it was her signature stamp of excitement. Coming from the show’s sharpest-tongued veteran, it landed like a standing ovation. For a newcomer, few welcomes are more validating than that.Corcoran has spent over a decade dissecting pitches and sizing up personalities. Her enthusiasm for Strahan suggests more than respect—it hints at real expectation. Whether it’s his business acumen or his TV polish, she seems to believe he’s the right fit for the high-stakes heat of the Tank.Before becoming a TV and business powerhouse, Strahan dominated the NFL as a defensive end for the New York Giants.He’s a Super Bowl champion, Hall of Famer, and still holds the single-season sack record. That relentless drive now powers his ventures—from fashion to media. And this fall, it follows him straight into the Tank.Strahan joins a fresh lineup of guest Sharks for Shark Tank Season 17, stepping in after Mark Cuban’s exit. Alongside him, Chip and Joanna Gaines are also confirmed for guest roles this season. But it’s Strahan who’s grabbing the spotlight, with his multi-hyphenate career spanning NFL, network TV, and fashion.ABC’s Instagram post featured the smiling new Shark and read: “This multi-hyphenate is ready to take a seat as a Guest Shark! "" Fans instantly flooded the comments—but Corcoran’s came first. That early nod not only boosted buzz, but also framed Strahan as more than just a celebrity seat-filler.With years of live TV under his belt, Strahan is no stranger to high-pressure moments. But Shark Tank is a different arena—one where instincts matter just as much as strategy. Corcoran’s reaction hints she sees something in him that can thrive in that space.Her short comment might have been casual, but it echoed with authority. “Incredible! Can’t wait” wasn’t just hype—it was an invitation into the inner circle. And with Season 17 approaching, one thing’s certain: Michael Strahan hasn’t even pitched yet, but he’s already won a Shark’s approval. Now all eyes are on how he'll sink or swim when the deals get real.With Corcoran's blessings and the spotlight firmly on him, Strahan's Shark Tank debut already feels like prime-time gold. If first impressions are anything to go by, Strahan's entry might just be the shake-up the Tank didn't know it needed.

A Week of Wild Challenges



IShowSpeed is no stranger to viral moments, but the recent one created in Poland has split the crowd into awe and disbelief. The 20 year old, touring the high octane IRL stream in East Europe, in cahoots with fitness trainer Adam Josef, took on a task which would normally be deemed impossible-lifting a car! And of course, not just any car, a one-ton Mazda MX-5, with passengers added for subsequent rounds.Live footage of the event on July 17 began spreading rapidly across X and TikTok. It showed Speed disdaining any safety gear like belts or lifting straps and doing multiple deathlifts of the car. ""I'm about to lift three humans in a car, bro,"" he said. ""Ain't nobody doing that but Superman.""The same fans erupted into cheers while watching the stream, especially when Speed pulled off the final lift with three adults onboard, and social media had exploded with reactions. Some regarded it as a superhero-worthy act. On the other side, the doubters were quick to address the mechanics behind the moment.A popular post on X went viral for praising him. “Nah, that’s cap. No way Speed’s a superhuman,” the user wrote, adding a breakdown that estimated Speed likely lifted around 70 kilograms (154 lbs), factoring in lever support from the car's build and its rear axle.Despite the skepticism, the stunt still required considerable strength and determination, especially considering Speed's refusal to use support gear and his obvious physical strain.After one of the lifts, he admitted, “F**k, I’m dumb lightheaded,” before collapsing momentarily, only to bounce back with full force.This wasn’t the only news which made headlines this week, Speed has been known for his engaging content. He is now known for his tricks and his hyper active interests towards everything.The Europe Tour Part 2 is now a combination of cultural mayhem, bodily aches, and meme moments.

What are 'Kiss Cams'

Who are Andy Byron and Kristin Cabot

A 'Kiss Cam' moment broadcast at a Coldplay concert Astronomer CEO Andy Byron and the firm’s chief human resources officer, Kristin Cabot. While featuring loved-up twosomes during the show, a camera panned over to a man who had his arms wrapped tightly around a woman, according to videos online. As soon as the two realised that they were on camera, the dup scrambled to hide their faces. The man, later identified as Andy Bryon, immediately ducked out of view while the woman, Kristin Cabot , hid her face in apparent embarrassment.Their reaction seems to have puzzled Chris Martin, the lead singer of Coldplay, who jokingly said, ""Oh, look at these two. You're all right. You're OK. Oh, what? Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy.""So what are these ""Kiss Cams"" that outed the tech CEO's affair. 'Kiss Cams' at concerts, like those seen at Coldplay shows, are a popular form of audience engagement and entertainment during breaks or lulls in the main performance. Much like those at sporting events, 'Kiss Cams' are a popular interactive segment designed to entertain the audience during lulls or breaks in the show. A camera operator scans the crowd, displaying random audience members on the large video screens (jumbotrons) in the stadium or arena. When the camera zooms in on a pair, the unspoken expectation is for them to share a kiss, often to the cheers and applause of the crowd.While intended as light-hearted fun and a way to foster communal enjoyment, these moments can sometimes lead to unexpected reactions, ranging from shy giggles to viral, awkward encounters. As seen in recent events, frontman Chris Martin might even playfully comment on the on-screen interactions, adding to the impromptu entertainment. The 'Kiss Cam' serves as a simple yet effective tool to engage thousands of concertgoers, transforming passive spectators into active participants in a memorable moment.As per his LinkedIn profile, Andy Byron has been CEO of Astronomer since July 2023. Before this, he has held senior-level roles at cybersecurity and software companies. The US-based Astronomer is valued at $1 billion. In May 2025, the company announced it has secured $93 million in Series D funding led by Bain Capital Ventures, alongside Salesforce Ventures and existing investors including Insight, Meritech, and Venrock, with Bosch Ventures seeking to participate.Kristin Cabot joined in July 2023, per his LinkedIn profile.

GTA 6: Grand Theft Auto VI expected to generate nearly $8 billion within two months of its release,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/gaming/grand-theft-auto-vi-expected-to-generate-nearly-8-billion-within-two-months-of-its-release/articleshow/122633119.cms,"Image credit: Playstation

GTA 6: What Konvoy analyst Josh Chapman predicted about GTA 6’s success



“🎮 GTA VI: we predict that GTA VI will generate $7.6 BILLION in revenue in the first 60 Days of its launch (current release date: May 26, 2026). This will be the greatest video game release of all time; shattering player, viewership, and revenue records.

For Take-Two Interactive's $2 billion investment into this game, we believe they will break even on that within 30 days of release (see our breakdown in the chart attached).

🚀 Predictions: Our Expectations of GTA VI:

We chatted internally here at Konvoy and decided to write down a few predictions and make them public. In the end, we're just gamers who can't wait to see this title released:

1️⃣ GTA VI is the largest gaming release of all time, shattering records of copies sold and revenue generated within almost every period of time

2️⃣ GTA VI will cost $80 (there will be premium versions of course, but the base price is $80)

3️⃣ GTA VI is the next UGC platform. It will have a UGC component that includes creator payouts for server hosts, mod creators, and more (mimicking the creator economics of UEFN and Roblox)

4️⃣ GTA VI will have 200-person lobbies, and there will be higher risk/reward dynamics where you can raid and steal items from players more easily

5️⃣ GTA VI will break even on its $2bn investment <30 days of release

6️⃣ GTA VI will hit the attached chart of copies sold, revenue, and player targets.

We can't wait for this title to be released in 2026. I'll certainly be playing it.”

Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason

Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6) is set to launch in May next year. Meanwhile, investment firm Konvoy has made some major predictions for the upcoming open world title’s financial performance. The video game venture capitalist company suggests that GTA 6 will generate $7.6 billion in revenue within just two months or 60 days of its release. Josh Chapman, a managing partner of Konvoy, shared this forecast on a post shared on the professional networking site LinkedIn. He highlighted that the firm believes that the highly anticipated game will have major commercial success. However, it's important to note that Konvoy's projection is based on certain assumptions that Take-Two Interactive has not yet confirmed, such as an $80 price point for the game and a reported budget of around $2 billion, which the company is said to have spent to develop the game.Konvoy's analysis suggests that GTA 6 could recover its estimated $2 billion budget in under 30 days and build considerable momentum. The firm predicts that it may become the gaming industry’s biggest launch to date and is expected to break records for both copies sold and revenue generated by a game. Considering that analysts have referred to GTA 6 as ""the most important game to ever release in the industry,"" a multi-billion dollar revenue figure may be within reach for the title.In his LinkedIn post, Chapman wrote:",Grand theft auto 6 (gta 6) is set to launch in may next year.

After nearly 12 years since its global debut in 2013, Grand Theft Auto V (GTA V) and GTA Online have finally launched in Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on July 17, 2025. The launch comes with a newly implemented 21+ age rating, a regulatory milestone that has enabled the full, uncensored version of the game to be released in the Gulf.The official release spans PlayStation 5, Xbox, and PC, both in digital and physical formats. Despite its controversial content, GTA V now enjoys legal status in both countries after years of being available only through imported discs or foreign digital accounts.The official announcement was made via PlayStation Arabia’s X (formerly Twitter) account, which invited players to “experience the ultimate entertainment,” marking a historic moment for Gulf-based fans who have waited more than a decade for a legal release.Though never officially “banned,” GTA V was effectively blocked in Saudi Arabia and the UAE due to strict media regulations around mature content. The main barriers to release included:Even titles like the GTA Trilogy and Red Dead Redemption 2 only gained approval years after their international releases, underlining the slow, case-by-case scrutiny applied to mature games.The turning point in GTA V’s approval came with the introduction of a new 21+ age rating, a global first that is higher than the standard 18+ rating found in most other countries. This classification permits the release of unedited adult content without requiring changes to game mechanics or narratives. Although localized age ratings were first introduced in 2016, they were insufficient to clear GTA V under the previous standards.The upgraded classification was formally approved by Saudi Arabia’s General Authority for Media Regulation (GAMR) and the UAE Media Council following direct consultations with Rockstar Games and Take-Two Interactive.This release is also tied to a new distribution agreement between Take-Two and Advanced Initiative Company, a Saudi firm that will now serve as the official distributor for all Take-Two titles in the region, including GTA, NBA 2K, WWE 2K, and Red Dead Redemption.The deal not only enabled the long-awaited launch of GTA V but also paves the way for future releases to arrive in the Gulf without the delays that have historically plagued mature-rated titles.No, the game remains largely unaltered. Thanks to the newly introduced 21+ age rating, GTA V has been approved in its full form, including all depictions of violence, firearms, mature language and themes, without any cuts or content modifications. This higher classification was specifically created to allow adult-themed games to pass regulatory scrutiny without being edited, and GTA V is one of the first major titles to benefit from this shift.However, one major exception remains: gambling-related content. Since 2019, all casino features in GTA Online have been explicitly prohibited in Saudi Arabia and the UAE due to religious and legal restrictions on gambling. As a result, the Diamond Casino & Resort, a virtual location within the game where players can engage in betting activities, remains disabled in both countries. Players attempting to access the casino will encounter an in-game message stating that the feature is unavailable in their region.This is consistent with broader policy in the Gulf, where other global games with gambling mechanics, such as card packs, loot boxes, or virtual betting, are also often restricted or adjusted for compliance. While the 21+ rating provides greater flexibility for adult content, it does not override strict anti-gambling laws, which continue to be enforced without exception.The approval of GTA V marks a significant cultural shift in how Saudi Arabia and the UAE approach adult-oriented games, setting the stage for GTA VI to potentially launch in sync with its global release on May 26, 2026. This milestone aligns with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, which emphasizes investment in digital entertainment and esports as part of broader economic diversification.While the core content of GTA V remains uncensored thanks to the new 21+ age rating, future titles like GTA VI may still face localized restrictions on specific missions or features. However, with studies showing that over 90% of gamers in the MENA region are above the age of 21, the market is clearly ready for mature-rated titles at scale.On July 17, 2025, for PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.No, except for casino content, all features remain intact and uncensored.Because gambling is prohibited under the laws and religious norms of both countries.A special 21+ age rating, higher than the typical 18+ used elsewhere.Most likely, as this release sets a precedent for smoother, timely approvals.","Gta v and gta online officially launched in saudi arabia and uae on july 17, 2025, after a 12-year delay.
