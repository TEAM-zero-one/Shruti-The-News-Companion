2.5 crore 'bogus' IDs solve case of vanishing tickets on IRCTC site,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2-5cr-bogus-ids-solve-case-of-vanishing-tickets-on-irctc-site/articleshow/121606882.cms,"Poll Have you ever experienced difficulty in booking railway tickets during peak seasons? Yes, frequently No, not at all

NEW DELHI: If you have been baffled by how and why railway tickets in certain trains disappear within minutes of the booking window opening even 60 days before the scheduled journey, IRCTC has detected those behind creating this artificial crisis. Only in the past five months, it detected 2.9 lakh suspicious PNRs while analysing ticket purchases done within just five minutes after booking commenced for both general and Tatkal tickets.Top railway officials said between Janand May, they have deactivated 2.5 crore suspected user IDs for booking tickets and put 20 lakh user IDs under revalidation as a part of a special drive. ""A total of 134 complaints have been registered with the national cyber crime portal and over 6,800 disposal email domains have been blocked. This drive will be intensified further,"" said an official.Disposable email addressing refers to an approach that involves using a unique email address for each contact or entity, or using it for a limited number of times or uses. The fraudsters have been resorting to these tactics to book tickets and charge more from unwary passengers.Sources said the problem of all tickets getting booked quickly is confined to certain routes and trains.""So, the focus is on weeding out users who are beating the system. Passengers can't be blamed as there is a genuine shortage of confirmed tickets. So, the effort has been to increase capacity and to run more trains, particularly during peak travel seasons,"" said an official.Officials claimed that IRCTC has taken ""systemic measures"" including engagement of leading content delivering network and anti-BOT applications - security techniques used to distinguish between genuine human users and automated bots or scripts - with cutting edge technology to ensure a smooth booking process for genuine travellers.The officials added that the railways' ticketing and catering arm achieved its highest ever per minute booking of 31,814 tickets on May 22, 2025 at 10am.""Attempt versus booking ratio has increased from 43.1% to 62.2% between Oct 2024 and May 2025,"" said an official.

Amid challenges faced by major global economies, India has the right momentum and resources to emerge as a global hub for technological breakthroughs, particularly in data and big data,” he said.Sanjeev Sanyal, member of the Economic Advisory Council to the Prime Minister, emphasized that structural reforms alone are not enough to achieve the aspirations of“We need to go deeper and embrace process reforms. They are essential for improving efficiency, reducing system-level friction, and delivering measurable impact across both government and business operations,” he noted.Adding to the discussion, Mohandas Pai, Chairman of Aarin Capital, highlighted the need to rethink education models to prepare for a quantum-driven future.“Governments must urgently reconsider how we educate the next generation, especially as quantum computing and AI begin to handle tasks traditionally performed by humans,” Pai said.Vic Bhagat, Senior Vice President and Global Advisor at IT infrastructure services giant Kyndryl, pointed to the transformative potential of AI in enterprise technology.“AI’s power lies in its seamless integration with enterprise systems.

Was it fate? Cardi B claims God pushed her toward NFL star Stefon Diggs



Rapper Cardi B reveals she dated Stefon Diggs because God told her to (Instagram0





In an age where relationships are often broadcast like highlight reels and Instagram captions double as love letters, Cardi B has taken an entirely different route. Her recent voice note on X (formerly Twitter) wasn’t just another celebrity confession—it was raw, spiritual, and deeply human. With the honesty of a diary entry and the impact of a sermon, Cardi peeled back the layers of her evolving relationship, one that fans believe involves Buffalo Bills wide receiver Stefon Diggs.And this isn’t your typical Hollywood love story. According to Cardi, this connection wasn’t sparked by slick DMs or flashy meet-cutes. It was orchestrated by something—or someone—much bigger.“I’m with the person that I am with now because sometimes, I don’t know, like, I just feel like God would tell me to give him a chance,” she admitted, with a vulnerability rarely seen from the Bronx-born rapper. “Which is so weird.”In just those few words, Cardi transformed her story into something far deeper than tabloid fodder. After enduring emotional ups and downs, particularly surrounding her long-standing and often-public rollercoaster with Offset, she found herself in a quiet space where someone showed up—not for fame, not for clout, but for her.She detailed those silent struggles: moments of depression, nights of uncertainty, and mental spirals that felt endless.But right then, when she needed it most, came an unexpected yet consistent presence.“When I had those weird episodes, that’s when a n***a would like hit me up or text me out of the mood, checking on me and stuff like that.”There were no fireworks. Just genuine check-ins. In a world that’s loud, his care was quiet—and that, Cardi seems to suggest, was what made all the difference.Before fans connected the dots, long before Instagram posts and matching vibes made it official, she was doing something she hadn’t done in a while: building slowly. This wasn’t about replacing one headline with another. It was about rediscovering trust.“I built a friendship,” she shared. “I got to know the person. They get to know me. We still getting to know each other.”For someone whose life has often played out on stages and timelines, this grounded, spiritually-guided journey feels refreshingly different. It’s not about perfection—it’s about presence. And Diggs, now a wide receiver for the New England Patriots, seemed to understand that perfectly.Cardi and Diggs finally went Instagram official last weekend, ending weeks of speculation. Her heartfelt livestream, shared by Live Bitez, showed a softer side fans adored. Many rushed to the comments with love. “Cardi u dont owe us no explanation!” one user wrote. “Even if it don’t end in marriage, at least you had fun!”This new chapter hasn’t been without noise, though. Offset, her ex and father of her children, took a subtle jab by tweeting, “Good roll out n PR. Today I pass.” Diggs countered with an icy flex—posting a photo of himself mid-catch with the caption, “We good...”Still, the noise seems irrelevant to Cardi. Because for her, this wasn’t about performance. It was about peace, presence, and perhaps, divine timing. If anything, her story reminds us all—sometimes, healing arrives not with fireworks, but with a quiet text at the right time.Also Read: Why Derek Carr left $30 million behind: the real story behind his Saints exit and retirement","Cardi b says god told her to give nfl star stefon diggs a chance.

World Environment Day: 7 ways to reduce your carbon footprint when buying beauty products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/beauty/world-environment-day-7-ways-to-reduce-your-carbon-footprint-when-buying-beauty-products/articleshow/121635970.cms,"The beauty industry's environmental impact is significant, but consumers can make planet-friendly choices. Opt for products with natural ingredients and certifications, support local brands to reduce transportation emissions, and minimize single-use packaging by choosing refillable or package-free options. Embrace multi-tasking and waterless products, research brand ethics, and practice mindful consumption to promote a more sustainable beauty routine.

Read the labels like a pro



Buy local, support small



Say no to single-use packaging



Multi-tasking products are eco superstars



Go waterless where you can



Check the brand’s sustainability ethics

Use less, finish more



Beauty that’s more than skin deep



Beauty may be skin deep, but its impact on the planet goes far beyond that. From plastic-heavy packaging to harmful production processes and long transportation chains, the beauty industry leaves a sizeable carbon footprint. As conscious consumers, we have the power to shift the narrative and make planet-friendly choices without compromising on our skincare or glam routines.On this World Environment Day, here’s how you can reduce your carbon footprint while shopping for beauty products:The journey to sustainable beauty begins with mindful ingredient choices. Harsh chemicals like parabens, phthalates, sulphates, and microbeads aren’t just harmful to your skin in the long run, they also damage ecosystems when they wash down the drain. Instead, opt for products with naturally derived, biodegradable ingredients that won’t pollute waterways.Look for third-party certifications. These aren't just buzzwords, they indicate that the product has met certain environmental standards in both formulation and production.When it comes to reducing your carbon footprint, the shorter the supply chain, the better. International beauty products may be tempting, but they often rack up air miles that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.Consider supporting local or regional brands that source and manufacture within your country. These often use locally available botanicals, reducing the energy needed for transportation.Bonus: buying local supports artisans, small businesses, and often results in fresher formulations.If your beauty routine includes dozens of plastic tubes, jars, and droppers, it’s time for a rethink. The beauty industry produces over 120 billion units of packaging every year, most of which ends up in landfills or oceans.To reduce your impact:Opt for refillable products whenever possible (think lipsticks, deodorants, perfumes).Choose brands that use glass, aluminium, or PCR (post-consumer recycled) plastic.Go package-free with solid shampoos, conditioners, and soaps.Support companies offering recycling return schemes.Do you really need a separate cream for your neck, face, and eyes? Often, the answer is no. Multi-use products reduce packaging waste, manufacturing resources, and shipping energy.Look for:Lip & cheek tintsBB creams with SPFAll-in-one serums (hydration + antioxidant + brightening)Cleansers that double as makeup removersNot only will your bathroom shelf thank you, but your travel bag will too.Water is a precious resource, and yet many skincare and haircare products are made up of up to 90% water. The extraction, treatment, and transportation of water adds to environmental strain. Waterless beauty is an emerging trend that helps mitigate this.Try products like:Powder-to-foam cleansersSolid shampoos and conditionersOil-based serums and moisturisersSheet mask alternatives like reusable cloth masksBy choosing waterless formats, you also get longer shelf lives and concentrated formulas that require less packaging.A brand’s marketing might be green, but what about their backend practices? Look beyond the product itself and research:Is the brand carbon-neutral or carbon-negative?Do they use renewable energy in production?Are their workers paid fair wages?Do they offset emissions through tree planting or verified carbon credits?Many ethical brands are transparent about their sustainability reports and list them on their websites. Supporting them means contributing to a cleaner, more equitable planet.It’s tempting to hoard makeup or jump on every new skincare trend, but overconsumption is one of the biggest environmental culprits. Instead of a “more is more” approach, shift your mindset to “quality over quantity.”Wait till you finish a product before buying another.Use the correct quantity to make your products last longer.Share products with a sibling or roommate to reduce wastage.Donate unopened, unused items to verified beauty banks.Minimalism isn’t just aesthetic, it’s sustainable.As beauty consumers, we don’t need to overhaul our entire routine overnight. But small, consistent changes can compound into a major impact. Choosing a refillable lipstick, supporting a local brand, or switching to solid shampoo are all steps that reduce emissions, conserve resources, and push the industry toward greener practices.","The beauty industry's environmental impact is significant, but consumers can make planet-friendly choices.

Every year, millions of Muslims from across the globe journey to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to perform Hajj — one of the five pillars of Islam and the most significant spiritual undertaking in a Muslim’s life. This year, the Hajj pilgrimage is not only a religious journey of devotion and reflection but also a remarkable feat of digital transformation and technological innovation. For 2025, Saudi Arabia has introduced a host of cutting-edge upgrades to ensure pilgrims can perform their rituals with ease, safety, and seamless connectivity. From the provision of free, high-speed internet to the deployment of AI-powered crowd monitoring systems and climate-controlled mosque environments, the Kingdom is leveraging advanced technology to modernize the pilgrimage experience at an unprecedented scale.This effort reflects the Kingdom’s broader Vision 2030 goals, which include transforming Saudi Arabia into a global hub for innovation while preserving its deep-rooted religious and cultural heritage. According to the Gulf News report, with over 10,500 WiFi hotspots, full 4G and 5G coverage, AI-driven safety systems, and even the world’s largest mosque cooling infrastructure, Hajj 2025 may be the most technologically advanced pilgrimage in Islamic history.One of the most talked-about innovations this year is the provision of free, high-speed internet access for all Hajj pilgrims. Saudi Arabia has installed more than 10,500 WiFi access points throughout the pilgrimage zones, including Mecca, Medina, Mina, Arafat, and Muzdalifah. This vast network eliminates the need for pilgrims to seek connectivity during their rituals or logistical movements.According to Saad Al Shanbari, spokesperson for the Hajj Communications and Technology System, the initiative aims to enhance both the spiritual and logistical journey of the pilgrims, as per the Gulf News report. “There’s no need to search for WiFi,” he stated. “Internet access is now available for all pilgrims, everywhere.”This connectivity not only allows pilgrims to stay in touch with family back home and access religious resources but also provides real-time updates, maps, and official communications directly from Hajj authorities.In tandem with the WiFi rollout, the Communications, Space and Technology Commission (CST) has achieved 100% 4G and 5G network coverage across all major Hajj sites. This includes high-density areas such as:This move ensures high bandwidth and low latency for millions of simultaneous users, accommodating massive data transfers, real-time video calls, and even live religious broadcasts to families and followers around the world.Saudi authorities report that over 4,000 telecom engineers and technical staff have been deployed to maintain and optimize service during peak Hajj days.Crowd management during Hajj is critical, given that millions of pilgrims converge in confined spaces, especially during peak rituals like the Day of Arafat or the symbolic stoning at Jamarat. For 2025, Saudi Arabia has introduced an AI-powered crowd control and safety monitoring system developed in collaboration with Aramco Digital.This system integrates:The AI monitors crowd flow in real time, identifies bottlenecks or high-density zones, and alerts authorities instantly to deploy crowd control personnel or reroute groups to avoid stampedes or accidents.Al Shanbari emphasized the real-time responsiveness of the system, saying, “We’ve deployed smart surveillance systems to manage crowd flows through AI-based monitoring and secure communications. The safety of pilgrims is our highest priority.”Another groundbreaking innovation is the world’s largest cooling system installed at the Grand Mosque in Mecca. As Hajj 2025 coincides with the peak of summer in Saudi Arabia, temperatures are expected to soar above 45°C (113°F). To combat this, the Kingdom has enhanced its centralized air conditioning infrastructure, using underground pipelines to pump chilled air across prayer halls and corridors.The cooling system comprises:This is a critical move for public health and comfort, especially for elderly and physically vulnerable pilgrims. Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Hajj and Umrah confirmed that this upgrade has already helped prevent numerous cases of heatstroke and dehydration during the initial phases of Hajj 2025.As part of the smart Hajj initiative, Saudi Arabia has also digitized its emergency response operations. Hospitals and medical tents near pilgrimage sites are now AI-integrated and GPS-synced, enabling faster triaging, emergency routing, and real-time coordination between ambulances and medical teams.An example of the system’s success emerged recently when an Egyptian pilgrim survived a heart attack and received immediate treatment thanks to the system's real-time alert and GPS tracking. He is now recovering and is expected to resume his pilgrimage after medical clearance.To tie everything together, Saudi Arabia has launched the Hajj Smart App, an all-in-one platform offering:This app is GPS-enabled and linked to the broader smart infrastructure, allowing pilgrims to navigate easily, even in dense crowds or unfamiliar areas.","For 2025, saudi arabia has introduced a host of cutting-edge upgrades to ensure pilgrims can perform their rituals with ease, safety, and seamless connectivity.

iOS 26 expected updates

Apple will kick off its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on Monday, June 9 at 1 PM ET (10:30pm IST), where it is expected to unveil its biggest operating system redesign since iOS 7, along with sweeping UI changes and updated names across its operating system platforms. According to rumours, the company may change the name system of operating systems. Instead of version number, operating systems will now be named by year. It means the update after the current iOS 18 will be iOS 26 rather than, say, iOS 19. Similar naming system may be introduced for other OS platforms as well.While artificial intelligence is expected to play a smaller role compared to recent tech industry trends, Apple is aiming to deliver long-requested improvements such as better window management for iPads and deeper personalization features. According to a 9to5Mac report, the company is working on practical updates to everyday apps such as Messages, Music, Notes, and CarPlay, offering a mix of AI-powered tools and design upgrades.Among the standout additions expected on the Messages app in iOS 26 is automatic message translation, powered by Apple Intelligence. This feature will allow real-time translation of incoming and outgoing texts, improving communication across different languages—similar to features already seen in apps like Google Meet.In Apple Music, the Lock Screen Now Playing view is rumoured to get an upgrade. The full-screen album art may feature an animated artwork, making for a more immersive experience directly on the Lock Screen—a small but polished touch that builds on recent UI improvements.As per the report, Apple Notes will also gain the ability to export notes in Markdown, a long-awaited feature for users who frequently move between Apple’s native app and third-party platforms.The 9to5Mac report states that the design refresh coming with iOS 26 will extend to CarPlay, bringing it in line with the broader Apple ecosystem’s updated visual language. Although the full scope of changes is unclear, it says that both regular and “Ultra” versions of CarPlay will receive visual updates.","Apple will kick off its worldwide developers conference (wwdc) on monday, june 9.

World Environment Day: How to go zero waste in fashion without losing style,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/fashion/style-guide/world-environment-day-how-to-go-zero-waste-in-fashion-without-losing-style/articleshow/121637222.cms,"The fashion industry's significant environmental impact calls for a shift towards sustainable practices. Consumers can minimize textile waste by shopping intentionally, embracing second-hand options, and repairing clothes. Supporting eco-conscious brands, adopting mindful laundry habits, and advocating for slow fashion are crucial steps. Ultimately, the goal is to reduce consumption and cherish garments, promoting a greener wardrobe.

Shop with intention, not impulse







Embrace second-hand and vintage



Swap, rent or borrow



Learn the art of repair and upcycling



Support zero-waste and sustainable brands



Be smart with laundry



Declutter mindfully, not wastefully



Advocate for slow fashion



The fashion industry is often romanticised for its glamour, but behind the scenes, it’s one of the most polluting industries in the world. Every year, it produces 92 million tonnes of textile waste, and contributes nearly 10% of global carbon emissions. On World Environment Day, there's no better time to re-evaluate your wardrobe habits and commit to a more sustainable path -without sacrificing style.Going zero waste in fashion doesn’t mean you have to wear burlap sacks or boycott shopping altogether. It simply means minimising textile waste, rethinking consumption, and extending the life of garments.Here’s how you can start your zero-waste fashion journey:The average person buys 60% more clothing now than they did 15 years ago but keeps them for half as long. Fast fashion thrives on our impulse buys, selling trendy pieces that quickly go out of style.To break the cycle:Ask yourself: Do I really need this? Will I wear it at least 30 times?Build a capsule wardrobe - a limited set of versatile, timeless pieces you truly love.Invest in high-quality, well-tailored clothing that lasts longer.Fashion doesn’t have to be fast to be fabulous.Thrift stores, consignment boutiques, and online marketplaces or even Instagram thrift shops are treasure troves for one-of-a-kind pieces.By shopping second-hand, you're saving garments from landfills and reducing the demand for virgin resources.Plus, vintage fashion:Is unique and often better madeLets you create a personal style that’s not dictated by seasonal trendsIs more affordable and planet-friendlyYour best outfit might already exist—just not in your closet yet.Who says you have to own every outfit you wear?Clothing swaps with friends or community groups are a great way to refresh your wardrobe without buying new.Rental platforms are ideal for occasion wear like wedding lehengas or cocktail gowns.Borrow from your friends and family, especially for one-time events.This circular approach keeps clothes in use longer and drastically reduces fashion waste.We’ve become too used to tossing clothes at the first sign of wear. But a missing button or broken zip isn’t the end of the road.Mend small damages instead of discarding garments.Upcycle old outfits, turn a long kurta into a trendy co-ord set, or jeans into a denim bag.Learn basic sewing skills, or support local tailors and artisans who can give your clothes new life.Your “ruined” clothes might just need a little imagination.More fashion labels are adopting zero-waste design, where every scrap of fabric is used. Some brands even use textile waste from other companies to create new garments.Look for labels that:Produce limited, made-to-order collectionsUse deadstock fabrics, organic cotton, or recycled fibresPractice transparent and ethical productionIndian brands like Doodlage, Nicobar, Bhu:Sattva, and No Nasties are great examples of mindful fashion that doesn’t harm the planet.Yes, even the way you care for your clothes has an impact.Wash clothes less frequently and only when needed.Use cold water and gentle detergents to reduce energy usage.Air-dry clothes instead of using a dryer whenever possible.Avoid synthetic fabrics that shed microplastics - opt for natural fibres like cotton, linen, hemp, and Tencel.How you maintain your clothes matters just as much as how you buy them.If you’re doing a wardrobe purge, don’t just throw old clothes in the bin.Donate to verified organisations that pass them to those in need.S ell online via preloved platforms.Repurpose as cleaning rags, cushion stuffing, or pet bedding.Compost 100% natural fibre garments if they’re beyond repair.The goal is to keep clothing out of landfills as long as possible.Fashion trends may come and go, but environmental responsibility is here to stay. Use your voice as a consumer to support policies and brands that champion sustainability.Follow slow fashion influencers for education and inspiration.Share your zero-waste fashion journey on social media.Encourage friends and family to make conscious choices.Write to brands asking for transparency and responsible practices.Every ripple adds up to a wave of change.Going zero waste in fashion isn’t about perfection - it’s about intention. It’s about rethinking the way we interact with our clothes, consuming less, and cherishing more. On World Environment Day, take the first (or next) step towards a greener wardrobe.Because what’s the point of being well-dressed if the planet is distressed?","On world environment day, there's no better time to re-evaluate your wardrobe habits.

What is Aylo's issue with the age-verification law?

How many minors watch porn in France?





Pornhub, Redtube and Youporn were scheduled to be suspended in France on Wednesday, according to parent company Aylo.Instead of porn, the company will only display a statement on France's new regulations that require porn sites to verify that their users are 18 or older, a Pornhub spokesperson said on Tuesday.Alyo's sites, like other porn sites available in France, has until June 7, 2025, to implement a rigorous new age verification standard.It's part of a French government push to shield minors from inappropriate content.France's Deputy Minister for Digital Technology Clara Chappaz defended the government's move late on Tuesday.""We're not stigmatizing adults who want to consume this content, but we mustn't do so at the expense of protecting our children,"" she told France's Europe 1 TV.The sites aren't protecting children, so it is now the government's responsibility, she said.Currently, users to explicit sites can click a a box declaring they are over 18, but their age isn't actually verified.France's new standard requires explicit websitesto verify a user's age using a credit card or a government-issued ID document.And to protect users' identities, the standard requires porn sites to use an external site for this age verification.Using a principle known as double anonymity, the porn sites will then only receive confirmation that the person is of legal age and will not know their identity. The external service provider will know the identity of the user but not the reason for the age check or the sites the user visits.Alyo has said that it is in favor of age verification but says it should be done on the devices used rather than on the websites visited.The porn industry giant has called the French government's measure potentially privacy infringing and ineffective.In a post on X on Tuesday, deputy minister Chappaz said the standard, with its double anonymity, guaranteed privacy.""It's unacceptable to lie when you don't want to respect the law,"" she posted. ""If Aylo would rather leave France than apply our law, they are free to do so.""Users in France account for Pornhub's second largest audience after the United States, according to Pornhub's own statistics for 2024.And, says France's digital and audiovisual communication regulator Arcom, some 2.3 million minors access porn websites every month in the country.That's 12% of France's total number of porn users.Adult content platforms have come under fire elsewhere in the European Union.EU regulators said last month that they would investigate several porn sites, including Pornhub, for failing to comply with rules to protect children.","Pornhub, redtube and youporn were scheduled to be suspended in france on wednesday.

"High-tech Hajj: More safety but less privacy, spirituality?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/high-tech-hajj-more-safety-but-less-privacy-spirituality/articleshow/121620878.cms,"High-tech Hajj: More safety but less privacy, spirituality? (Image: AP)

Can high tech boost safety?

'Contact us'?

Less religion, more cyber





This year, it's drones featuring thermal imaging and robots handing out religious advice.A decade ago, it was all about the miracle of the mobile phone. And a century or so ago, the motor car was the highest of high-tech used during the annual Hajj pilgrimage.The Hajj, one of the largest gatherings of humans on Earth, is meant to be undertaken by every adult Muslim once in their lifetime. It will begin in Saudi Arabia on June 4 and end June 9. During those days, up to 2 million pilgrims from over 180 countries will take part in a number of different religious ceremonies in Mecca.But having so many people moving around in one comparatively small area has led to problems in the past. Thousands of pilgrims were killed in stampeding crowds in 1990 and 2015. Last year over 1,300 died due to extreme heat; pilgrims often walk up to 65 kilometers a day in 40-to-50 degrees Celsius heat. There have also been fires, protests, suicides, collapsing buildings and infectious diseases at the Hajj, as well as more everyday problems like people getting lost or having health problems.No wonder then that the Saudi authorities are trying to use technology to improve how they control crowds and cater to their visitors.This year, Saudi Arabia will use drones with thermal imaging as well as artificial intelligence and facial recognition technology to ensure that only those who have Hajj permits are allowed in.Last year's many deaths were mostly of pilgrims who didn't have official permission to be there and therefore couldn't access services like air-conditioned shelter in the extreme heat.To avoid overcrowding, Saudi Arabia's Nusuk website, also a mobile phone application, allows attendees to register to enter certain areas at allotted times. The Nusuk system includes an electronic identity card and a smart wristband, which hold information on the user's identity, travel plans, finances, health and accommodation, among other things. The Nusuk card must be carried throughout the pilgrimage and is used to access transport and other services. Some of the wristbands have location tracking, monitor the wearer's blood oxygen levels and heart rate, and can even be used to call for medical help.Other technological advances at this year's Hajj include robots to guide visitors around religious sites and to hand out water, Korans or offer advice in 11 languages. There are also newly paved, more reflective (and therefore cooler) streets, paths that minimize vibration for walking comfort, and a special white pilgrim's gown made from futuristic fabric that keeps the wearer up to 2 degrees Celsius cooler.All the technology, surveillance and advanced algorithmic calculation is meant to make the event safer and the chance of tragic accidents less likely. But as the amount of technology grows, so too do concerns about data privacy, state surveillance and potential cybercrime.""All of these technologies are mandatory and those who refuse them are not allowed to perform the pilgrimage,"" explains Zeinab Ismail, a researcher and editor at the Lebanon-based digital rights organization, SMEX. ""All of this, combined with Saudi Arabia's personal data protection law, which only partially aligns with international standards and contains concerning provisions and loopholes, raises increasing concerns about the safety and privacy of pilgrims' data. ""Saudi officials have argued that privacy concerns must outweigh safety at such a huge event.""Regardless of the [Saudi government's] justification, what worries me the most — and irrespective of the technology itself — is the fact that this technology is being deployed in a country where rule of law is weak, there's no transparency and no [state] accountability,"" argues Marwa Fatafta, policy director for the Middle East and North Africa at international digital rights organization, Access Now.It would be difficult to audit the technologies for problems and even harder for individuals to question their use, Fatafta told DW.""For the people who are going to the Hajj pilgrimage, they're not in any position to push back and say, 'I don't want to give my biometric data',"" she continued. ""So just the general context means that the door is wide open for abuse.""Reading the Nusuk app's terms and conditions, information about how long pilgrims' personal data can be kept is vague and even contradictory. DW e-mailed Saudi Arabia's National Data Management Office and the supervising Saudi Data and AI Authority to ask for more information on this. Both organizations publish e-mail addresses for the public to use if they have questions or want to make a complaint.Two DW e-mails received no response. Another bounced back with the message: ""Recipient's mailbox is full.""Since 2023, Saudi Arabia has had a personal data protection law — but as Ismail pointed out, ""the current legal framework … allows legislation to be interpreted or manipulated in ways that may serve state interests over human rights.""It's not just potential misuse of millions of pilgrims' data by local authorities causing concern. Higher dependence on technology to monitor and control Hajj pilgrims also means more vulnerability in general, as there are more places for hackers to attack. And Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states are already some of the biggest victims of cybercrime.The first platform Saudi Arabia used for registering pilgrims, Motawif, was run by a private company and unexpectedly sent spam to users. The state-run Nusuk app replaced it in 2022. The following year, cybersecurity experts found data submitted to Nusuk for sale on illicit websites that deal in stolen personal data.New technology has also brought another worry: Is all that high tech taking away from the once-in-a-lifetime spiritual relevance of the Hajj?A 2018 study conducted by researchers at the University of Central Lancashire in the UK suggested it might be.Pilgrims interviewed for the study complained about others taking selfies at holy sites, talking on the phone while performing rituals and behaving like tourists rather than pious visitors. ""Smartphones are the fourth devil in Hajj,"" one interviewee said, referring to a ritual featuring three representations of the devil.Some even complained all the technology was making the journey too easy.Where once pilgrims walked between holy sites, now they ride a high-speed train. And where once they stayed in simple tents, now they're accommodated in 10,000 air-conditioned, fire-resistant tents.""Since the Hajj has become 'high-tech,' the fundamental spirituality of the pilgrim's experience is arguably being transformed into something more akin to a 'cyber experience',"" the UK researchers wrote. Traditionally the Hajj is meant to be all about simplicity, spiritual purity and contemplative worship, they explained.As with every other kind of digital technology, high tech at the Hajj had its benefits and disadvantages, they concluded.","High-tech hajj: more safety but less privacy, spirituality?
