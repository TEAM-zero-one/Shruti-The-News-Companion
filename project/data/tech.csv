Indian Army: CCS clears mega deal for big indigenous artillery guns,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ccs-clears-mega-deal-for-big-indigenous-artillery-guns/articleshow/119234281.cms,"CCS clears mega deal for big indigenous artillery guns

NEW DELHI: Big indigenous guns are finally booming. The PM-led cabinet committee on security on Wednesday cleared the around Rs 7,000 crore deal to acquire advanced towed artillery gun systems ( ATAGS ) for the Army , in a major boost for home-grown capability to manufacture such heavy-duty howitzers .The deal is for 307 howitzers, which have a strike range up to 45-48-km, and 327 gun-towing vehicles to arm 15 artillery regiments of the Army, with the contract expected to be inked next week, top sources told TOI.Designed and developed by DRDO , the 155mm/52-calibre ATAGS will be produced by Bharat Forge and Tata Advanced Systems . Bharat Forge will manufacture 60% of the guns after it emerged as the L-1 (lowest bidder), while Tata will produce the remaining 40%.TOI was the first to report that the ATAGS deal would be inked within this fiscal after clearance from the CCS. The orders for ATAGS are likely to go up in the future because the Army plans to induct “more advanced versions” for a total requirement of 1,580 such guns.India, incidentally, has also secured a couple of export orders for the ATAGs, which officers say have “excellent” accuracy, consistency, mobility, reliability and automation, and can fire five-round bursts as compared to three-round bursts by other contemporary foreign guns.With ATAGS having an “all-electric drive technology” to ensure maintenance-free reliable operations over longer periods of time, India will be able to export the guns in large numbers in the years ahead, an officer said.The ATAGS, whose development began in 2013, has undergone a series of protracted field trials over the years. Finally, in 2021-22, the winter trials were successfully completed at high-altitude areas in Sikkim, which were followed by summer user-firing tests at the Pokhran field firing ranges.The ongoing Russia-Ukraine war has again driven home the operational utility of long-range, high-volume firepower. Consequently, the Army is progressively stepping up induction of howitzers, missiles, rocket systems and loiter munitions, as reported by TOI earlier.In Dec, for instance, the defence ministry inked a Rs 7,629 crore contract with L&T in collaboration with South Korean Hanwha Defence for the procurement of another 100 K-9 Vajra-T self-propelled tracked gun systems, which have a strike range of 28-38 km and can be deployed in high-altitude areas along the frontier with China.Then in Feb, the MoD inked contracts worth Rs 10,147 crore for high-explosive pre-fragmented extended rockets (45-km range) and area denial munitions (37-km) for the indigenous Pinaka multi-launch artillery rocket systems being inducted by the Army. Pinaka, too, is being exported to other countries.India has grappled with recurring scandals in import of artillery guns , from the Swedish Bofors in the mid-1980s to the South African Denel in 2005 and Singapore Technology Kinetics in 2009, repeatedly derailing the Army's modernization drive.","Ccs clears mega deal for big indigenous artillery guns.

MUMBAI: The Union cabinet on Wednesday approved an incentive scheme to promote low-value BHIM-UPI transactions , focusing on payments made to merchants. The Rs 1,500 crore initiative, running from April 1, 2024, to March 31, 2025, aims to boost digital adoption among small businesses.Under the scheme, person-to-merchant (M) transactions up to Rs 2,000 will be incentivised. Small merchants will pay no merchant discount rate (MDR) and banks will receive an incentive of 0.15% per transaction. Large merchants will also benefit from zero MDR but will not be eligible for incentives. Transactions above Rs. 2,000 will remain MDR-free but without incentives.""The incentive scheme on promoting low-value UPI transactions, which has been approved by the Cabinet today, will encourage digital payments and further 'Ease of Living',"" Prime Minister Narendra Modi said in a post on X.Incentives will be routed through acquiring banks, which will then distribute them among issuer banks, payment service providers, and app operators.

BENGALURU: The IT sector is trudging in the slow lane, operating at a lacklustre pace. Industry analysts forecast a slower pace of recovery with moderate growth for a longer period, even as the IT sector faces potential challenges stemming from the macro-economic environment and technology transition, increasing risks to revenue growth. This presents a case for a weak multiplier effect, leading to subdued growth for Indian IT firms.Analysts have also observed that growth rates are becoming polarised among various players, primarily influenced by company-specific developments. ""Change in tech cycle is likely to create a transition phase for tech services companies (like 2016/17), causing growth to moderate in short term. We are lowering our dollar revenue growth forecasts by 100-200 bps and expect growth of 4.5% in FY26 and 6% in FY27 for large-cap IT companies,"" analysts at Morgan Stanley wrote in a recent report.Jeffries said it has changed stance on IT sector to underweight (from overweight) due to rising growth worries in the US. ""Weakened US growth outlook is reflected in US 10-year bond yield decline and higher Fed rate cut expectations. Moreover, with the US Dollar Index now down 4.2% in one month, the pressure on the Rupee may reduce going forward, which was a margin tailwind for IT companies,"" a note said.Morgan Stanley said IT stocks have corrected by 6%-18% (vs sensex 6%). ""Despite drop, relative valuations vs sensex are still at five-year average (14.5% premium vs 5-year average of 14.4%). We see risks to consensus revenue estimates and a potential de-rating risk for multiples back to long-term average.""Morgan Stanley said tech shifts would open up newer opportunities, but growth will slw down in initial transition period. Its report highlighted examples of new addressable market opportunities, such as modernisation of a legacy technology stack of applications using Gen AI technology, data and analytics work related to both structured and unstructured data and automation of basic-level jobs creating efficiency benefits such as contact centre operations.","Analysts have observed that growth rates are becoming polarised among various players.

Santander UK's announcement on Wednesday that it plans to shut a fifth of its branch network has raised concerns about the bank's future in the UK. The move, which could result in around 750 job losses consist of the closure of 95 out of 444 branches by June.The bank which has faced speculation over its long-term presence in the UK, will retain 349 branches, including 290 full-service locations and 36 branches with reduced hours. Like many other UK banks, Santander has been scaling back its physical presence as customers increasingly turn to digital banking, reported news agency Reuters.Since 2019, the bank has reported a 63% rise in digital transactions, while in-branch financial transactions have declined by 61% over the same period. Despite this, the closures have sparked criticism from UK lawmakers, who argue that they harm local businesses and make it more difficult for vulnerable customers in rural areas to access banking services.In response to these concerns, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) introduced new rules in September to make it more difficult for banks to close branches without ensuring that customers have free access to cash alternatives.Santander UK explained that the decision to close branches was part of its strategy to align with customer behaviour. ""As a business, we must move with customers and balance our investment across all the places where we interact with them,"" said the bank. ""Closing a branch is always a very difficult decision, and we spend a great deal of time assessing where and when we do this and how to minimize the impact on our customers.""The bank added that it is consulting with employee unions and will provide support to affected staff, including assistance with finding alternative roles within the bank.In its most recent financial report, Santander UK posted a 38% drop in annual pre-tax profit, totalling £1.33 billion ($1.73 billion) in 2024. The bank employs approximately 18,000 people.Despite reports in January suggesting that Barclays had explored a potential offer for Santander UK's operations, the parent company reiterated last month that its UK unit remains a key part of its globally diversified business strategy and is not for sale.","Santander uk plans to close 95 out of 444 branches by june.

The engineering division specialises in hydraulics, water treatment, additive manufacturing, aerospace and automation solutions.The consumer division of Wipro Enterprises focuses on FMCG products across personal care, home care, lighting and switches segments.LMW, based in Coimbatore, operates across various sectors including textile machinery, CNC machines, foundry and castings, and aerospace components and composites.According to Dhruv Shekhar, senior associate at Koan Advisory Group, Apple's strategy to strengthen ties with local suppliers like Wipro Enterprise and Lakshmi Machine Works aims to minimise supply chain risks, reduce costs and improve operational efficiency.Also Read | Turnaround from importer to exporter!

ICICI Securities has maintained its ‘buy’ rating on Grasim Industries with a target price of Rs 3,093. Analysts said that the management is confident of further ramp-up of its new paint business . Flushed with initial success of product/brand acceptability in the market, Grasim is on track to meet its guidance of seizing a high-single-digit industry market share . Further, buoyed by the success of its economy product range, Grasim is all set to make its mark in the premium decorative paint segment. With expected scale-up in institutional segment sales and broader endeavour to operate at optimal capacity utilisation, Grasim reiterated its guidance of Rs 10,000 crore revenue and EBITDA breakeven in FY28.Macquarie has put an ‘outperform’ rating on Tata Motors with a target price of Rs 826. Analysts feel the key drivers to track would be the management's confidence on delivering JLR's net cash balance sheet by March 2025, healthy growth outlook for the US along with signs of recovery in the EU and the UK, partly offset by volume risk in China, and market-share gains in the domestic CV segment.Motilal Oswal Financial Services has a ‘neutral’ rating on One97 Communications (PayTM) with a target price of Rs 870. Analysts said they remain watchful on the challenging macro-environment, traction in the financial distribution business and near-term UPI market share. They feel in case a merchant discount rate is introduced on UPI payments, that will be a significant boost to PayTM’s revenue and will incentivize the company to push for market share gains in the consumer payments.JM Financial has initiated coverage of Tata Communications with a ‘buy’ rating and a target price of Rs 2,030. Analysts are bullish on the company’s data business as they expect data segment EBITDA to grow at a robust CAGR of ~21% over FY24-28 (Expected). They feel the key risks to the stock’s target price are weak global macro leading to deferment in discretionary tech spends and adverse AGR ruling.InCred Equities has an ‘add’ rating on Pidilite Industries with a target price of Rs 3,470. Analysts feel the company is building focused portfolios and separate teams aided growth in underserved markets. Distribution expansion and the innovation engine will continue to drive growth. While the near-term demand environment remains under pressure, Pidilite targets double-digit UVG in the medium term.","Icici securities has maintained its ‘buy’ rating on grasim industries with a target price of rs 3,093.

Indian airline IndiGo announced plans on Wednesday to increase its international flight capacity by fiscal year 2030 in an effort to capture a larger market share.The no-frills carrier intends to raise its international capacity share—measured as the proportion of total available seat kilometres dedicated to international routes—from the current 28% to 40%, news agency Reuters reported. This shift marks a significant growth from just 14% in fiscal year 2018, achieved in a span of seven years.IndiGo currently flies to 40 international destinations and holds a 19% share of India’s international flight market, according to the latest data from the country’s aviation regulator. Following the announcement, shares of the airline rose by 4.2%.This international expansion comes as IndiGo seeks to diversify beyond its dominant domestic market, where it holds nearly 60% of the share. The move aligns with the broader trend of Indian carriers working to meet the growing demand for both domestic and international air travel, despite challenges related to aircraft supply.Earlier this year, IndiGo revealed plans to strengthen its international presence, which currently generates around 10% of its revenue. The airline also announced plans to lease a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner from Norse Atlantic Airways to expand its long-haul operations.IndiGo is looking to add business class seats to its Airbus A321XLR and A350 aircraft to further increase revenue, as business class tickets are priced roughly three times higher than economy class.The airline began offering business class seats on select domestic routes late last year, marking its first move away from an all-economy cabin model, and is positioning itself to capitalize on the growing demand for premium travel among Indian passengers.IndiGo also reaffirmed its goal of expanding its fleet to over 600 aircraft by 2030, up from approximately 437 currently.","Indian airline indigo plans to increase its international flight capacity by fiscal year 2030.

Google parent Alphabet agreed to acquire cloud security firm Wiz for $32 billion in cash, reaching a deal less than a year after initial negotiations fell apart because the cloud-computing startup wanted to stay independent.Wiz will join the Google Cloud business once the deal closes, the companies said in a statement on Tuesday. The takeover is subject to regulatory approvals and is likely to close next year, they said.The deal, which would be Alphabet’s largest to date, comes after Wiz turned down a $23 billion bid from the internet search leader last year after several months of discussions. At the time, Wiz walked away after deciding it could ultimately be worth more by pursuing an initial public offering company. Concerns about regulatory challenges also influenced the decision.Shares of Alphabet fell nearly 3% in New York on Tuesday.The Wiz takeover is by far the largest M&A deal to be announced this year. Deal hungry companies and their advisers had initially predicted that US President Donald Trump’s policies would create better conditions for buying and selling, supercharging an M&A market that just got back on its feet after a lull. Instead, his tariff threats and geopolitical tensions have spooked markets and kept dealmakers in wait-and-see mode.Google framed the Wiz ac quisition as a way to beef up its cloud security offerings with new ways to keep their systems secure in a new era of Artificial Intelligence.“AI brings new risks, but also new opportunities,” Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in a call with investors. “Organisations are looking for cybersecurity solutions that improve cloud security and span multiple clouds.”","Wiz will join the google cloud business once the deal closes, the companies said.

Solana meme coins , once the stars of 2024, have seen their market caps decline in recent months. However, one standout project is defying the trend. Solaxy ’s crypto presale is rapidly approaching the $30 million mark, undeterred by the broader market downturn.Unlike typical meme coins, Solaxy aims to go beyond fleeting hype, positioning itself as a game-changer for the Solana ecosystem with its ambitious layer-2 scaling solution .The Solana meme coin market has been quiet for a while now. The tokens that captured massive attention in 2024 are losing value.BONK, for example, has seen a steep 45% drop on the monthly chart. From one of last year’s hottest tokens, it is at risk of being another forgetful meme coin.But it’s not just the Solana meme coin market that is suffering. Significant members of the market like Dogecoin and Shiba Inu have also seen a sharp decline. The overall crypto market is in a downtrend, with Bitcoin slipping under $90,000. On top of that, Solana’s frequent congestion issues are driving users and developers away. While the network was a hot hub for meme coins in 2024, its rising transaction fees and slow processing times are making it less attractive for new projects. Solaxy brings real utility to the Solana network. It is developing Solana’s first-ever Layer-2 scaling solution.The project’s goal is to address the blockchain’s congestion issues head-on by processing transactions off-chain. After that, they are batched for final verification.The mechanism could significantly reduce the strain on Solana’s mainnet by lowering transaction fees and expediting processing speeds.Even during peak trading hours, Solaxy could help keep the network frictionless.Beyond scalability, Solaxy has bigger ambitions. According to its white paper, the project plans to introduce cross-chain functionality between Solana and Ethereum.In other words, it is not just another scaling tool. It has the potential to bridge major blockchain ecosystems, unlocking opportunities in NFTs , gaming, and DeFi.Solaxy’s growing popularity indicates that investors are ready to back innovative projects despite the bearish market. Influential crypto voices like Austin Hilton have taken notice of the project, highlighting its core features.Even as the broader market struggles, Solaxy is gaining strong momentum.Solaxy is currently priced at just $0.001648, while Solana is selling for $130. The price difference presents a significant upside for early investors.While Solana has a $65 billion market cap, Solaxy’s starting valuation leaves substantial room for potential growth. The presale price is a major attraction for early investors.The incentives don’t stop there. Early adopters can benefit from Solaxy’s passive rewards program. It allows investors to earn by locking their tokens. Solaxy’s current annual percentage yield (APY) stands at around 150%, presenting an opportunity for investors seeking long-term gains. More than 6.5 billion tokens have been locked into the protocol so far. With 25% of the supply set aside for community rewards, the team shows commitment to stability. The strategy could reduce early-stage sell-offs and lay a robust path for growth.Security is another factor working in Solaxy’s favour. A thorough audit by Coinsult has verified that the project has no vulnerabilities. The full audit report is available on Solaxy’s website. The transparency offers reassurance to investors.With the $30 million milestone close, the window of opportunity to join the crypto presale is closing fast. Investors can join the presale using either cryptocurrencies or bank cards.To streamline the process, Solaxy has partnered with Best Wallet. The presale is also compatible with popular Web3 wallets like MetaMask. Participation is simple for both seasoned and first-time investors.A clear roadmap is laid out for the project’s journey ahead, with 30% of funds allocated to project development and 25% going to community rewards. 15% will be used for marketing initiatives, while 10% will be allocated for liquidity. And 20% will be held in the treasury.Solaxy is building a large community on social media platforms too, with its official X (Twitter) account already amassing 70,000 followers.Name: SolaxyEmail: Help@solaxy.com*You must be at least 18 years old to access this site.","Solaxy aims to go beyond fleeting hype, positioning itself as a game-changer for the solana ecosystem.
