Astronomer CEO BEGS For ‘TRUST’ Amid ‘Surreal’ Fallout After ColdplayGate | Byron-Cabot Scandal

Poll Do you think leadership changes help companies overcome controversies? Yes No

Astronomer's reputation takes a hit







Pete Dejoy, the interim CEO of Astronomer, did not bury his head on the scandal as he took charge of his new role and instead put out a statement on LinkedIn. Dejoy said the media attention to their startup because of the viral video has been unusual and surreal. Astronomer is now a household name, he said adding that he would never wish for it to happen like this.""At Astronomer we have never shied away from challenges; a near-decade of building this business has tested us time and time again, and each time we’ve emerged stronger. From starting a software company in Cincinnati, Ohio, to keeping the lights on through the collapse of the bank that held all our cash, to scaling from 30 to 300 people during a global pandemic that demanded we do it all without ever being in the same room,"" he wrote.""The events of the past few days have received a level of media attention that few companies—let alone startups in our small corner of the data and AI world—ever encounter. The spotlight has been unusual and surreal for our team and, while I would never have wished for it to happen like this, Astronomer is now a household name,"" his statement read.""I’m stepping into this role with a wholehearted commitment to taking care of our people and delivering for our customers.Astronomer’s foundation remains strong, built around the thriving Apache Airflow community. Our opportunity to build a DataOps platform for the age of AI remains massive. And our story is very much still being written,"" Dejoy said.After the video went viral, the work culture of Astronomer started being questioned as many people suggested that another person from the office, who was aware about the affair, was present. Though the company issued a statement denying the presence of any other person apart from the former CEO and the HR chief, many former employees spoke out anonymously about the toxic work culture of the startup.While Andy Byron resigned amid the controversy, Astronomer's silence over Kristin Cabot, the HR head who was there with Andy, has been questioned. The company did not mention her in any of its statements so far.Following the embarrassing incident, Megan Kerrigan, wife of Andy Byron, had removed the 'Byron' surname from her Facebook profile before deleting it.","Pete dejoy, the interim ceo of astronomer, did not bury his head on the scandal as he took charge of his new role and instead put out a statement on linkedin.

NEW DELHI: Early on Thursday, the ED swooped in on more than 35 premises identified with industrialist Anil Ambani and at least 50 entities associated with his Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG) across Mumbai in a larger money laundering investigation targeted at him based on multiple FIRs registered by CBI and other agencies over the last few years. The searches have huge financial implications for public money, Rs 20-30,000 crore, which the agency believes has been siphoned off.The searches at premises identified with industrialist Anil Ambani have huge financial implications for public money, Rs 20-30,000 crore, which the agency believes has been siphoned off, including outside the country, through ""undisclosed foreign bank accounts and foreign assets"" created over the years. A large chunk of the money came to Reliance ADAG from SBI and other public sector banks, besides Yes Bank, then a private entity, and mutual funds.Preliminary investigation has thrown up a mysterious entity: 'C Company'. The entity, whose existence was not known so far, is allegedly found to have been involved in related party transactions in this whole scam, sources said.Sources said ED was probing an alleged loan fraud ofRs 14,000 crore involving Reliance Communications Ltd and other associated entities. In response to a question in Lok Sabha on Monday, minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary said SBI has ""classified Reliance Communications Ltd along with promoter director Anil Ambani as 'fraud' on June 13"".This has also been communicated to Bombay Stock Exchange.""Based on information received from Sebi, ED has found Reliance Infra has diverted large sums of money disguised as ICDs to group companies of ADAG (Anil Ambani group) through 'C Company', an undisclosed related company,"" a source told TOI.Reliance Infra did not disclose 'C Company' as its related party in order to avoid having to take proper approval from shareholder and audit committees, the source added. It was also hidden presumably to circumvent checks and balances imposed on related party transactions as per laws.Besides, there is an investigation in the alleged diversion of loans of over Rs 10,000 crore by Reliance Infra. ED's probe is looking at why Reliance Infra took a haircut of Rs 5,480 crore, receiving only Rs 4 crore in cash, while agreeing to settle the remaining Rs 6,499 crore through transfer to certain discoms, which have neither been operational nor done business for many years.The agency is already probing Ambani and his entities in a case of Rs 3,000 crore received from Yes Bank where he is alleged to have bribed the former CEO of the bank, Rana Kapoor, through his wife's company for Rs 225 crore. In another case of alleged misappropriation of bank funds, the agency is probing Reliance Communications for a loan default ofRs 1,050 crore to Canara Bank.Sources said more than 25 individuals, including Ambani and his close associates, are targets of the search operations which started on Thursday morning in a probe initiated under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.ED is being assisted by multiple agencies, including National Housing Bank, Sebi, National Financial Reporting Authority and Bank of Baroda among others.The alleged loan diversion of around Rs 3,000 crore from Yes Bank pertains to the period between 2017 and 2019. ED is investigating alleged quid pro quo in sanction of loan as a Reliance Anil Ambani entity had transferredRs 225 crore into the accounts of RAB Enterprises, in which Rana Kapoor's wife Bindu Kapoor had 100% stake.These are all part of an FIR registered by CBI and now being investigated by ED. The FIR also alleged that credit approval memorandums were back dated, and the proposed investments lacked due diligence, not meeting the bank's credit policy.Sources said preliminary investigation found that these loans were diverted to many group entities and shell companies, in many cases there was no proper documentation to loans issued. In several cases, borrowers were found to have common addresses and directors.","The ed swooped in on more than 35 premises identified with industrialist anil ambani and at least 50 entities associated with his reliance anil dhirubhai ambani group.

Contractual service providers across more sectors will be eligible for business visas of up to 12 months.Govt sources said the UK has agreed not to impose numerical limits on Indian business mobility and won't require Indian companies to advertise locally before applying for these visas. Last year, the UK granted 25,117 visas under the Global Business Mobility route.

NEW DELHI: Indian negotiators are targeting labour-intensive goods and services to boost India's tiny 1.9% share of UK imports. The new trade pact promises zero- or near-zero tariffs on textiles, leather and footwear, engineering goods, chemicals and pharmaceuticals - relief the government says will make Indian exports far more competitive.Government said 99% items of trade (called tariff lines), comprising 100% of India's exports, are covered in the deal.In textiles, for instance, there are 1,143 items on which zero-duty market access will be provided to Indian goods, blunting the duty advantage that Bangladesh, Cambodia and Pakistan have so far enjoyed. So, readymade garments or home textiles, carpets, handicrafts and traditional items such as pashmina shawls or Kanchipuram or bandhini sarees are expected to gain. India is fourth-largest textile supplier to UK, accounting for over 6% of imports.Government officials said India hopes to outperform competitors such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia, Turkey and Bangladesh in the footwear market, especially athleisure and sports shoes, in addition to Vellore and Kolhapuri chappals and traditional leather shoes. In recent years, several large sports shoe manufacturers have tied up with Indian producers to make footwear for brands like Puma, Adidas and New Balance for domestic and global markets.There are sectors where India has a large presence in other markets but a limited share of the British market. Indian exporters hope to replace competitors across a variety of engineering goods, including machinery and components, where zero-duty access will be provided to 1,659 items. With exports of $4.3 billion, India holds a small share of the $194 billion machinery imports by British businesses. Govt is projecting to double the value of exports by March 2030.India also has a small share in UK's pharma imports - only $1 billion out of $30 billion in 2024. The govt is eyeing gains in not just generics but also medical devices such as ECG machines and X-ray systems.For chemicals, where India's exports to UK were $570 million last year, the government is betting on a 30-40% jump in the first year itself as over 1,200 chemicals will be given duty-free access. Businesses are eyeing an opportunity in gems and jewellery sector, where exports are now pegged at $940 million.Although government has maintained that it has not opened several critical agricultural sectors such as dairy, apples, edible oil and oats under the Comprehensive Economic & Trade Agreement, it hopes to push Indian grapes, processed food, bakery items and marine products into UK supermarkets.A lot of the market access in these segments will also depend on the quality standards that the UK puts in place and also other trade deals that it enters into in the coming months.","Indian negotiators are targeting labour-intensive goods and services to boost india's tiny 1.9% share of uk imports.

NEW DELHI: The much-anticipated duty cuts for Scotch and gin is not happening overnight. While import duty will come down from 150% to 75%, it is unlikely to happen until at least the second half of 2035.That's because the agreement will take at least a year to be ratified by the British Parliament and there is a gradual tariff reduction roadmap starting with duties in India dropping to 110% in the first year of implementation. The UK government said customs duty will reduce to 40% over the next decade.What's more, govt has got the UK to agree to a minimum import price which means, whisky, gin or any other drink that costs under $5 in a one litre bottle or $6 in a 750 ml bottle will get the tariff benefit and the MIP will be indexed to inflation.However, industry officials say that despite halving import duty, the actual reduction of consumer prices will not be more than 10%. ""The share of customs duty to the overall structure of MRP is hardly 15-20%, depending on the category. The rest comprises state govrnment taxes, and distribution margins. So actual consumer prices will come down by only 8-10%,"" an official said.The reduction in import duty will be a benefit for manufacturers of Indian Made Foreign Liquor.Around 80% of imported scotch is in bulk form, which is used for bottling in India and for blending by local whisky brands.But the industry cheered the move. Sanjit Padhi, CEO of International Spirits and Wines Association of India (ISWAI), said the agreement paves the way for a more balanced and equitable trade environment, particularly as Indian alcohol exports to the UK have zero import duties.""We laud the Indian and British governments for formalising this historic treaty which will boost bilateral trade and positively impact the accessibility of premium Scotch whisky in India, reigniting growth and increased choice for Indian consumers,"" Praveen Someshwar, MD and CEO of Diageo India, said.","The much-anticipated duty cuts for scotch and gin is not happening overnight.

NEW DELHI: Government has agreed to cut tariffs on thousands of products imported from UK - from chocolates and cosmetics to cars, silver and Scotch - but reduction and elimination of customs duties will not translate into the entire benefit being passed on to consumers.To begin with, customs duty is only the basic cost of the landed price for an Indian seller. On top of that are local levies - GST or excise - which even an Indian manufacturer has to pay. And, this can be a significant portion of the final price.Take the case of alcohol, for instance, where the landed price of a bottle of the popular Johnnie Walker Black Label is estimated at around Rs 350, which at 150% customs duty sees a levy of Rs 525. On top of that, there is a 200% margin for the importer, the company, in most cases - which means an addition of around Rs 750 - taking the landed price to Rs 1,275. Then comes excise of 85% or Rs 1,084 and VAT of 25% (Rs 590), taking the wholesale price to Rs 2,950. Then comes the retail margin, pushing the cost in a market like Delhi to over Rs 3,000 a bottle.The actual price reduction for a customer will only be Rs 200-300 a bottle, a top industry executive told TOI while predicting a higher margin for companies.That's especially true for Made-in-India whisky, which blend anywhere between 1% and 25-30% Scotch imported in bulk form. ""Going forward, for several MNCs operating in India, bottling in India may not be a great idea and they will simply import bottles of blended whisky,"" the source said.A similar situation is likely to play out in other sectors such as cosmetics too, where companies will see improved margins, said marketing executives. There is no mechanism for govt to ensure the full benefit is passed on. Although it tried to ensure the window is no longer available under GST and in any case, companies dragged authorities to court, questioning the calculations.In segments such as automobiles, competition from players will drive pricing behaviour, as will other trade agreements. For instance, with the EU deal in the pipeline, a German carmaker or Tesla may just lower domestic prices significantly to grab a bigger pie of the market.With duty reduction in several segments staggered over 10 years, price cuts are not on the immediate horizon.","Customs duty is only the basic cost of the landed price for an indian seller.

NEW DELHI: India finally relaxed its highly-controlled duty rates on imported cars with the UK trade deal paving the way for customs charges to come down from the highs of 100%+ to as low as 10%, benefitting ultra-luxury car brands such as Jaguar and Land Rover, Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Aston Martin.However, the government has delayed the import duty concessions when it comes to electrics and other green cars, the measure being initiated to protect the domestic players who are looking to produce high-value clean cars. “There are no concessions given to electrics, hybrids, and hydrogen-powered vehicles in the first five years,” an official said.In petrol and diesel categories, the lower tariffs can be enjoyed for a limited number of vehicles as the government has imposed quotas and limits to protect the domestic makers and also curb mass-scale shipments.For large-engine petrol cars above 3000 cc and diesel cars over 2500 cc — traditionally luxury imports — India has committed to lowering the current 100%+ customs duty to 10% over 15 years, within a quota starting at 10,000 units and rising to 19,000 in year five, according to a review document of Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).For mid-sized cars (1500–2500 cc diesel / up to 3000 cc petrol), a 50% in-quota duty applies initially, falling to 10% by year five.Small cars under 1500 cc follow a similar tariff reduction path with a growing quota. “These in-quota vehicles enjoy sharply reduced duties, while out-of-quota imports still face tariffs ranging from 95% to 50%, depending on vehicle size and year,” GTRI said.In electrics, market access has been given mostly in the high price segment of vehicles priced above £80,000 (around Rs 94 lakh). “For vehicles priced below £40,000, no market access provided, ensuring complete protection for the mass-market EV segment in which India seeks global leadership,” the official said.While the duty cuts will happen only once the UK Parliament approves the agreement (possibly by the middle of next year), analysts believe that the duty reduction with the UK may pave the way for similar measures with other countries and trading blocs as well. “This is India’s first-ever auto tariff concession in any FTA, and it’s likely to trigger similar demands from Japan, the EU, South Korea, and the U.S.,” GTRI said.“By year five, up to 37,000 UK-built ICE vehicles could enter India annually at just 10% duty — far below the current base rate of 110%. This creates a preferential entry path for high-end British brands… but also for other UK-based exports. While the measure is capped in volume and spread over 15 years, the policy sets a precedent in opening India’s tightly controlled automobile market to bilateral trade partners—potentially triggering similar demands in future FTAs. ”",India finally relaxed its highly-controlled duty rates on imported cars.

Vice president JD Vance slammed US companies prioritizing H-1Bs instead of giving jobs to Americans and said he does not believe in the bulls**t story that these companies can't find workers in America. Speaking at a bipartisan event co-hosted by the Hill and Valley Forum, Vance questioned the ethics and economic logic behind mass layoffs by companies like Microsoft which is followed by an increase in H-1B applications.This suggests that these companies are laying off Americans and then applying to hire people from overseas.""You see some big tech companies where they'll lay off 9,000 workers, and then they'll apply for a bunch of overseas visas. And I sort of wonder; that doesn't totally make sense to me,"" Vance said.""That displacement and that math worries me a bit. And what the president has said, he said very clearly: We want the very best and the brightest to make America their home. We want them to build great companies and so forth. But I don't want companies to fire 9,000 American workers and then to go and say, 'We can't find workers here in America.' That's a bulls**t story.""Microsoft recently laid off 9,000 employees globally and came under scrutiny for its use of the H-1B visa program. According to several social media claims. Microsoft submitted applications for more than 6,000 H-1B visas since October while they are also laying off so many employees.An Indian-American tech investor reacted to JD Vance's suggestion and said the vice president would not mention that many of the 9,000 laid off employees were H-1Bs too and they got no severance, no safety net and just a 60-day countdown to leave the country.""Microsoft didn’t bring in new foreign workers after laying people off , they renewed visas for long-time employees who’ve been in the U.S. legally for many many years, stuck in green card backlogs. Saying that’s “replacing Americans” is like saying letting a loyal employee stay and renew his visa in the building is the same as hiring someone new off the street. It’s not. It’s just letting them stay in the job they already earned,"" the tech investor wrote.",Jd vance slammed us companies prioritizing h-1bs instead of giving jobs to americans and said he does not believe in the bulls**t story that these companies can't find workers in america.

The six-player cooperative game, which earned overwhelmingly positive reviews during its Steam Early Access phase, throws players into an underground research facility overrun by alien threats and military crusaders.Players must use scientific ingenuity rather than brute force to survive, crafting equipment from salvaged office supplies, alien artifacts, and destroyed computer parts. The game supports online multiplayer for up to six friends, allowing teams to tackle specialized roles including forager, fighter, chef, builder, or explorer as they navigate the sprawling GATE Cascade Research Facility .Abiotic Factor maintains a 4.62-star rating on PlayStation Store based on hundreds of user reviews, mirroring its Steam success where it achieved 94.38% positive feedback over 12 months. Players have praised the game's unique blend of Half-Life, Grounded, and SCP elements, creating what reviewers describe as an immersive survival horror experience with flexible base-building mechanics.The title joins an exceptionally strong July PlayStation Plus lineup that includes Cyberpunk 2077 , Diablo IV , and Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, marking one of the service's most robust monthly offerings in 2025.The PlayStation launch coincides with Abiotic Factor's simultaneous release on Xbox Series X/S and Game Pass, representing the New Zealand developer's push toward broader console accessibility.

I’ve entered the startup world again…

When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes.

I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how technology can make systems more efficient, equitable, and accessible. But I’ve learned over the years that the best way to understand how something works, or where it breaks, is to go straight to the people using it.

That’s why I’ll be joining the Phia customer experience team for a day this week. Phia is a fashion-tech tool built to make shopping smarter and more sustainable, and it’s the brainchild of my daughter Phoebe Gates and her co-founder Sophia Kianni.

They’ve built an app and browser extension that helps people shop smarter by finding the best prices, surfacing secondhand options, and showing lower-impact alternatives across thousands of online retailers.

It’s been inspiring to watch them tackle a massive challenge, rethinking the way we shop, by meeting users where they are.

And now, I’ll be doing the same.

Looking forward to getting back into the startup scene. Hopefully, I won’t break anything (no promises).

Big Question Answered: Why Google is Merging Android and ChromeOS

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, recently demonstrated a unique approach to leadership and family support by working a shift in customer service for his daughter Phoebe's new startup. In a LinkedIn post Bill Gates revealed that his daughter Phoebe Gates asked him to work a shift in customer service at her AI-powered fashion startup — Phoebe and Gates agreed to it. “I’ve entered the startup world again… When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes,” wrote Gates in a LinkedIn post.Phoebe Gates co-founded Phia along with her Stanford roommate Sophia Kianni. The platform uses AI to help users compare prices of new and second-hand products across more than 40,000 websites. A web browser/app, Phia aims to be the Booking.com of fashion, offering an instant price comparison from thousands of e-commerce sites for any item, new or used. Phoebe Gates is the youngest child of Microsoft founder Bill Gates and his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates. Bill Gates joined the customer service team of Phia for one day in order to understand how the product works.Bill Gates revealed that this experience reminded him that “the best way to understand how something works—or where it breaks—is to go straight to the people using it.” His stint echoes a growing trend among CEOs to spend time on the front lines, following examples like Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who famously delivered food and drove passengers to better grasp user pain points.Earlier, in April, Gates shared that he intentionally chose not to invest in his daughter’s AI-powered shopping app, Phia, during a podcast. He explained that funding the venture would have led him to oversee it too closely. Instead, he offered advice on staffing while others handled the investment.","Bill gates revealed that his daughter phoebe gates asked him to work a shift in customer service at her ai-powered fashion startup, phia.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has shared a post on X (previously known as Twitter), suggesting a shift in his stance toward artificial intelligence . Admitting he had been “living in denial” about the technology for too long, Elon Musk wrote in the post: “I resisted AI for too long. Living in denial. Now it is game on.” Musk was replying to a post shared by an X user Mario Nawfal that quoted Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang who called Musk a ‘superhuman’.While Elon Musk has been both a vocal critic and early investor in AI, he has previously warned about the dangers of uncontrolled AI development, once calling it humanity’s “biggest existential threat.” His latest statement suggests a more aggressive pivot from caution to action.The post comes as the tech billionaire continues to expand his presence in the AI space through xAI , the startup he launched in 2023 to compete with companies like OpenAI , Google DeepMind, and Anthropic.Elon Musk’s relationship with AI has been complex. The tech CEO co-founded ChatGPT-maker OpenAI in 2015, but later distanced himself from the company. Over the years, he has expressed concerns about AI safety, calling for regulation and greater oversight.While Elon Musk did not elaborate on what specific moves might follow his tweet, observers say the post is likely a signal to investors, rivals, and users that he intends to take a more direct role in AI development. Notably, the tech CEO tagged three of his major companies – Tesla, SpaceX and xAI in his post.Elon Musk’s “game on” remark also hints at increasing competition in the AI sector, where companies are racing to release faster, more powerful language models and build new infrastructure to support them.In a related news, Tesla India recently shared a post on X (formerly Twitter), announcing an update on the availability of Tesla cars in the country. “Now everyone in India can order directly on our website,” the post read, adding that four cities will get priority delivery. The post was later reshared by CEO Elon Musk.","Tesla ceo elon musk has shared a post on x (previously known as twitter) admitting he had been “living in denial” about the technology for too long, elon musk wrote in the post: “i resisted ai fortoo long.

Garena Free Fire OB50 Update FAQs

Will OB50 raise the minimum device spec?

Can Advance-Server progress carry into live servers?

Are previous Naruto Chapter 1 skins returning?

How do I report bugs post-update?

Is there any free way to get Rin?

Free Fire’s numbered updates usually tweak balance and drop a skin or two. OB50, however, lands at a turning-point moment for the game: ranked traffic is dipping, rival shooters are everywhere, and fans have begged for fresh mechanics. The pressure to innovate has never been greater, with competitive players demanding impactful changes to keep Free Fire relevant and engaging. Garena’s answer rolls out around 31 July 2025 (after a two-week public test that opened on 11 July). Inside are a brand-new character named Rin, a follow-up to last year’s wildly popular Naruto collaboration, overhauled weapon stats, slicker menus, and at least one surprise mode aimed at streamers. Most of these features surfaced on the Advance Server, where dataminers and pro squads have already stress-tested the build. Below is a plain-language rundown of every change that matters, so you can decide whether to hoard diamonds, clear storage, or both.According to reports, early scrims show Rin pairs insanely well with Chrono and Alok: land two head-shots, pop Chrono’s shield, then beam enemies with near-zero bloom. Garena may tone her passive before global release, but if it ships intact, expect sniper-assault hybrids to dominate high-elo lobbies for at least the first week.Garena says no; any phone that ran OB49 smoothly should handle OB50, though 2 GB free storage is recommended.No. Cosmetic and level resets are total; only feedback and bug-bounty rewards remain.Leakers found no files for a re-run, so Chapter 1 cosmetics appear to stay vaulted for now.Use the new in-game “Bug Center” button under settings; logs auto-attach, and accepted critical reports pay 1,000 diamonds.Garena usually adds a milestone login campaign two weeks after launch—log seven days straight, collect tokens, craft a voucher that can be used in the Diamond Royale for a shot at Rin without spending real money.","Garena free fire ob50 update lands at a turning-point moment for the game.

"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says: 'If I were 20 years old today, I would focus more on this field than software'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-says-if-i-were-20-years-old-today-i-would-focus-more-on-this-field-than-software/articleshow/122776861.cms,"Jensen Huang's evolving view: from engineering to physical AI

The rise of physical AI and the future of robotics

During a recent visit to Beijing, Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang was asked what he would study if he were a 20-year-old graduate in 2025. His answer was clear: he’d choose a different academic direction than the one that launched his own career. Though he didn’t explicitly name a single subject, Huang emphasized that he would lean more toward the physical sciences rather than software. This subtle but significant shift points to his evolving view of where the next wave of opportunity lies. His response reflects a broader vision for the future of artificial intelligence—one rooted not just in code, but in physics, robotics , and the mechanics of the real world that AI must increasingly learn to navigate and reason through.Jensen Huang, who earned his electrical engineering degree from Oregon State University and a master’s from Stanford, co-founded Nvidia in 1993. Today, the company sits at the forefront of the AI revolution and recently hit a historic $4 trillion market cap. While reflecting on his own path, Huang revealed he had graduated from college at age 20 and, if given the chance again, would pursue physical sciences, fields that deal with non-living systems like physics, chemistry, and astronomy.Although he didn’t go into specifics about why, Huang’s broader remarks provide insight. Over the years, AI has evolved from “Perception AI,” which focused on recognition tasks like image detection, to “Generative AI,” which includes language models capable of translating, coding, and creating. But the next chapter, according to Huang, is “Reasoning AI,” systems that can understand context, solve novel problems, and act as “agentic AI” or digital robots with reasoning power. Huang’s remarks hint at a future where AI is not just software-driven but deeply embedded in the physical world. This shift could redefine education paths for aspiring technologists, with physics and engineering regaining center stage. It’s no longer just about writing better code; it’s about building machines that think, move, and adapt. And for Huang, the future of AI might look less like a screen and more like a robot with a brain.Looking ahead, Huang predicts the rise of “Physical AI,” where artificial intelligence must grasp real-world physics: friction, inertia, cause and effect. These capabilities go beyond generating text or images—they involve anticipating how objects move, how to grip items with the right force, or how to infer the presence of hidden obstacles like a pedestrian behind a car.When AI gains this kind of physical reasoning and is embedded into machines, it leads to robotics, a critical component of Huang’s vision. With global labor shortages and the rapid expansion of manufacturing facilities, especially across the United States, Huang sees robotics powered by physical AI as essential. “Hopefully, in the next 10 years... they’re highly robotic and helping us deal with the severe labor shortage,” he said, underscoring the need for innovation that bridges the digital and physical worlds.","Jensen huang predicts the rise of “physical ai,” where artificial intelligence must grasp real-world physics.
