Budget 2026 expectations: Will gold and silver import duties be hiked?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/budget-2026-expectations-will-gold-and-silver-import-duties-be-hiked/articleshow/127822182.cms,"Why gold and silver imports worry policymakers



Why markets expect a duty hike



Why demand has held up despite record prices



Will higher duties curb demand?



Why silver is also under scrutiny



India’s gold and silver imports surged to record levels in 2025, ringing alarm bells in government and policy circles as soaring precious metal prices threaten to widen the trade deficit and add fresh pressure on the rupee. With limited policy tools available, officials and market participants told Reuters raising import duties is once again emerging as a key option under consideration.Any move to raise import duties may be signalled through the Union Budget 2026, either via changes in the customs duty structure or through an enabling provision allowing the government flexibility to act if external pressures intensify.Gold imports rose 1.6% year-on-year to $58.9 billion in 2025, while silver imports jumped sharply by 44% to $9.2 billion, even as global prices of both metals hit historic highs. Together, gold and silver accounted for nearly a tenth of India’s total foreign exchange reserves last year, a share that could rise further in 2026 if prices continue to climb.India is the world’s second-largest consumer of gold and the largest market for silver, but it depends almost entirely on imports to meet domestic demand for gold and more than 80% of its silver requirements. The surge in imports has widened the trade deficit and contributed to weakness in the rupee, which touched a record low earlier this month.While silver has extensive industrial uses—from solar power to electronics—gold is largely consumed for jewellery and investment. Policymakers have long viewed gold demand as non-essential and a drain on foreign exchange, prompting repeated attempts to curb imports through higher duties.With gold and silver prices at record highs, even stable import volumes translate into a sharply higher import bill. Trade and industry officials say this could prompt the government to consider raising duties in the coming weeks to contain external imbalances.India has a precedent. In 2012–13, New Delhi sharply increased gold import duties to stabilise the rupee during a period of currency stress. Traders now speculate a similar move could be on the cards, potentially reversing the 2024 duty cuts, when import taxes on both metals were slashed to 6% from 15% to curb smuggling.Reflecting these expectations, gold and silver in India are already trading at a premium to global benchmarks as markets price in the risk of higher duties.Gold prices in international markets have surged 98% since the start of 2025, dampening jewellery demand. Yet overall consumption has remained resilient due to a sharp rise in investment demand.While jewellery accounted for over three-fourths of India’s gold demand until 2023, investment now makes up more than 40% of total consumption. Investors have increasingly turned to gold coins, bars and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to benefit from the rally.ETF inflows jumped 283% in 2025 to a record Rs 429.6 billion ($4.69 billion), cushioning the impact of weaker jewellery buying and keeping imports elevated.Past experience suggests duty hikes may have limited impact. When India raised gold import tax to 10% in 2013 from 2%, demand remained largely unchanged. Domestic gold prices have climbed from about Rs 8,000 per 10 grams in 2006 to around Rs 1.62 lakh now, yet annual demand has not seen a sustained decline.Analysts say a fresh duty hike of 4–6 percentage points is unlikely to deter buyers, who absorbed a 76.5% price jump in 2025. Instead, higher duties could lift investor returns and risk reviving smuggling.Silver prices have risen even faster than gold, sharply inflating India’s import bill. While industrial demand was the main driver earlier, investment demand has gained traction in recent months.Silver ETF inflows surged to Rs 234.7 billion in 2025, up from Rs 85.69 billion a year earlier. The growing popularity of silver as an investment suggests imports could rise further if the price rally persists.--- just after peg-- Need 1-2 lines on how this change may be announced in the Budget","Gold imports rose 1.6% year-on-year to $58.9 billion in 2025.

Bigger operations signify a bigger footprint, says SC

New Delhi: In a significant departure from one-size-fits-all penalty approach, the SC has said bigger companies bear higher responsibility towards protection of environment and it would be justifiable to impose higher penalties on mega firms for environment damage caused by them, reports Dhananjay MahapatraThis decision by Justices Dipankar Datta and Vijay Vishnoi was given while dismissing appeals against orders of NGT imposing Rs 5cr penalty on Rhythm Country and Rs 4.47cr on Key Stone Properties for constructing residential and commercial projects without green clearance in Pune.Justice Datta rejected the arguments of the two realtors that the penalty imposed was disproportionate.The court also rejected the arguments that NGT did not have the jurisdiction or power to arbitrarily impose such high environmental damage compensation charges.Justice Datta said through the NGT Act the legislature has deliberately given the tribunal discretion to grant relief based on the seriousness of environmental harm.The core of appellant’s arguments was that turnover or project cost cannot be taken as a metric for determination of environmental compensation. “We are unable to accede to such a submission. Neither NGT Act nor the jurisprudence of this court calls for the adoption of a uniform formula for the quantification of environmental compensation,” the bench said.The Supreme Court further said that: “In cases relating to protection of environment, linking a company’s scale of operations (like turnover, production volume, or revenue generation) to the environmental harm can be a powerful factor for determining compensation.”“Bigger operations signify a bigger footprint. Larger scale means more resource use, more emissions, more waste leading to more environmental stress. If a company profits more from its scale, it is logical that it bears more responsibility for the environmental costs. Linking scale to impact sends a message that bigger players need to play by greener rules,” it said.",Supreme court says bigger companies bear higher responsibility towards protection of environment.

Food makers may have to keep daily production logs; stricter storage rules proposed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/food-makers-may-have-to-keep-daily-production-logs-stricter-storage-rules-proposed/articleshow/127813111.cms,"NEW DELHI: To make food safer and more traceable, the Food Safety and Standards Authority of India (FSSAI) has proposed new rules that would require food manufacturers to record what they produce and what raw materials they use every day, according to a draft notification issued in the Gazette.The proposed changes aim to improve hygiene, accountability and consumer safety, especially in processed and packaged foods.Under the draft rules, food manufacturing units will have to maintain daily records of production and ingredients, making it easier for regulators to track problems such as contamination, substandard ingredients or unsafe batches. Traders and distributors who do not manufacture food will not be covered under this requirement.The draft also seeks to enforce stricter storage practices. Food businesses will have to follow “first-in, first-out” (FIFO) and “first-expire, first-out” (FEFO) principles, ensuring that older or near-expiry food is used or sold first. This is intended to reduce the risk of expired or unsafe food reaching consumers. Retail shops, however, have been kept out of this provision.FSSAI has invited public feedback for 30 days before finalising the rules.Officials say the move is part of a wider effort to strengthen food safety as India’s food market expands, and to give consumers greater confidence in the quality of food they buy.","Proposed changes aim to improve hygiene, accountability and consumer safety.

Russia Backs India’s Energy Needs As Putin Defies Trump And Promises Steady Fuel Supplies To Delhi

New Delhi: Russian state-run atomic energy corporation Rosatom, during the India Energy Week in Goa, presented an integrated proposal for large power units and small modular reactors (SMRs), including floating power units — a unique Russian technology for countries like India with long coastlines and developed island territories.Rosatom also presented a comprehensive approach to solving problems in the field of nuclear energy and showed openness to the implementation of joint research projects.Russian company officials at the Goa event paid special attention to possibilities of scientific and technical cooperation based on multipurpose fast research reactor MBIR, which, after commissioning in 2028, will become the most powerful research reactor globally. India has also been invited to join an international consortium based on the reactor and participate in multilateral research programmes.“India is a strategic partner, cooperation with which has been building for many years and is aimed at developing nuclear and related industries. Joint nuclear projects form a solid technological and human foundation, designed for decades to come. The experience of implementing our flagship project, Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant, shows that we do not just work on individual tasks for the facility, but accompany the project throughout its life cycle, contributing to the industrial transformation of India,” Rosatom International Network CEO Egor Kvyatkovsky said.“We see great potential for deepening cooperation in both large power units and small modular reactors (SMRs) construction projects, as well as in non-energy areas such as nuclear medicine, isotope supply, joint research projects, additive technologies and digital solutions,” he said.Rosatom, which has been actively helping India build six 1,000 MW VVER-1000 pressurised water reactors at the Kudankulam nuclear power plant in Tamil Nadu, is also discussing new areas of cooperation such as construction of Russian-designed low-power nuclear power plants (ASMMs) in India. ASMM technologies are focused on providing clean electricity to remote areas with limited network infrastructure, as well as energy supply to individual industrial enterprises.ENDSCaption: Rosatom is already helping India set up six nuclear reactors at the Kudankulam nuclear power plant in Tamil Nadu","Russian state-run atomic energy corporation rosatom presented integrated proposal for large power units and small modular reactors.

Kayla Nicole swarmed by Swifties in what critics call online stalking

A single tap on Instagram was enough to reignite a familiar online storm. Kayla Nicole found herself trending again after fans noticed she had liked a post involving her ex, Travis Kelce . What began as a routine interaction quickly turned into a flashpoint, drawing intense reactions across social media and reopening long standing tensions tied to Kelce’s highly public relationship.The post itself had nothing to do with romance. Shared by Bleacher Report, it highlighted Travis and his brother Jason helping fund U.S. hockey player Laila Edwards’ family trip to Milan ahead of her Winter Olympics debut. The caption praised their generosity, calling them “two great guys that went out of their way when they didn’t have to.” Still, attention shifted away from the charitable act once screenshots showed Nicole’s verified account had liked the post.Fans protective of Travis Kelce’s relationship with Taylor Swift reacted swiftly. Screenshots spread fast, followed by harsh commentary. Some people said Nicole was just trying to get attention, while others wondered why the interaction was being made bigger in the first place. Nicole has been under a lot of online scrutiny since she broke up with Kelce in 2022, and the backlash added to that.This wasn't the first time people looked closely at what she did.People have seen past fashion posts and pop culture references as subtle digs, whether they were meant to be or not. Nicole has largely stayed silent during these moments, choosing not to respond publicly as speculation grows around her every move.The renewed focus also comes as the Kelce family continues to make headlines of their own. Travis’ mother, Donna Kelce, recently sparked conversation during interviews ahead of her appearance on The Traitors. When asked who she hoped to avoid on the show, she said, “Maybe some of my sons’ adversaries. That could either be on other teams, or it could be coaches, or it could be past girlfriends.”That remark only fueled discussion further. In today’s social media climate, even the smallest interaction can carry oversized meaning. For Nicole, a single like became another reminder that public history never fully stays in the past, especially when fans are watching every move.","Kayla nicole faced renewed online backlash after fans noticed she liked an instagram post involving her ex, travis kelce.

Technology is growing faster than ever in today's world, which is changing quickly. AI, or artificial intelligence, is a part of our lives every day, even if we don't always notice it. AI works behind the scenes in a lot of things, like search engines, mobile phones, office software, and online shopping. Some people are excited about this change, while others are worried about losing their jobs or becoming less important. A strong quote from Sam Altman gives clarity and hope in this situation. He says, ""AI won't take over for people."" But people who use AI will take the place of those who don't. This simple line reminds us that machines don't own the future. People who are willing to learn, change, and grow with technology, instead of running away from it, own it.At first, it might seem like Sam Altman's quote is too direct or harsh. But if we look closely, it has a good message. He is not saying that people will be useless. He is saying that people who know how to use AI the right way will have an edge.AI is a tool, just like computers, phones, and the internet were in the past. A lot of people were scared of these new technologies when they first came out.People who learned how to use them got better over time. This is also happening with AI today.This quote tells people to think of AI as a friend, not a foe. It tells us that being able to learn new things and adapt is more important than ever.Things like jobs, schools, and businesses are changing very quickly right now. AI is now used by a lot of businesses to write, design, help customers, analyze data, and plan. Students use AI to do research and learn. Even small business owners use digital tools to keep track of sales and customers.Because of this, people who don't want to learn new tools may slowly fall behind. It's not that they're less talented; it's that they're not keeping up with change.Sam Altman's words remind us that we can't stop progress. We shouldn't be afraid of it; we should get ready for it.AI isn't just for scientists or big businesses anymore. Now it's a part of everyday life. People use AI when they:These tools cut down on work and save time. They help people concentrate on being creative, solving problems, and growing as people. People who learn how to use these tools wisely often find that work is easier and more productive.AI is powerful, but it cannot replicate everything that makes people unique. Creativity, emotional intelligence, moral judgement, and imagination are still uniquely human traits.A machine can give you information, but it cannot feel sorry for you. It can analyse data, but it cannot truly grasp how people feel. That is why individuals with both technical capabilities and values will always be valued.This viewpoint is supported by a quote from Sam Altman. It claims that success stems from the combination of intelligence and compassion.This quote reminds students to learn new things as well as do their regular schoolwork. Learning about technology early on can help you in many ways later on.For people who work, this is a sign to keep learning new things. Learning never stops, especially in this digital age. Even small things, like learning one new tool at a time, can have a big impact.For business owners, this means using AI to make services better, cut costs, and better serve customers.","Sam altman's quote tells people to think of ai as a friend, not a foe.

His journey in real estate began at home, where his mother, a neighbourhood real estate agent, quietly bought 30–40 sites at a time, built houses, and sold them.Also read: Confident Group chairman CJ Roy’s death at Bengaluru office: 6.35mm bullet from Austria-made pistol pierced his heart Roy tracked the accounts and absorbed the workings of land transactions and cash flows — knowledge that later helped him make informed decisions, transforming parts of Bengaluru and Kerala.Although his family was based in Dubai, he chose to focus his career and investments in India.Roy had an active Instagram presence with 1.3 million followers, despite disabling the comment section. His last post was a Republic Day greeting: “A Very Happy Republic Day,” showing him smiling in a blue blazer. The post received nearly 5 lakh views. He regularly shared updates on cars, helicopters, travel, family, and real estate projects.Roy’s professional life began in 1990 with nine-to-five roles at companies such as BPL, TVS, and HP before he stepped into the realty business. The defining moment came in 2001 when most Bengaluru developers focused on central districts, while Roy saw potential in Sarjapur — then open fields with long roads, where acres were selling for about Rs 6 lakh.In 2005, he launched Confident Group. “I had enough capital to buy 150–200 acres in Sarjapur and decided to go ahead with it instead of sinking money into the CBD,” he said. Despite resistance from family and company directors, only his wife supported the move. Roy committed to building on the periphery — a gamble that paid off spectacularly.His first purchase in Kerala comprised two plots in Kakkanad. While 100 flats were designed and much was spent on roadshows, there were zero sales initially. A chance encounter in Mumbai with a TV executive led him to offer his flat as the prize for a reality show. Roy became the show’s brand ambassador, and the popularity led to flat sales soon after.Roy’s relationship with cars began in 1994 with his first vehicle — a Maruti car. Despite being dismissed by a salesman, he vowed to one day own the world’s most iconic cars. Over time, he amassed 12 Rolls-Royce cars, a Bugatti Veyron, a Koenigsegg Agera, Lamborghinis, a McLaren 720S, and a Mercedes-Maybach. Roy even repurchased his first Maruti, offering Rs 10 lakh to trace it.“Building a home is every man’s dream. So our business is in selling dreams,” Confident Group chairman CJ Roy once said.Confident Group flourished in Kerala, catering to luxury and middle-income housing across Kochi, Thiruvananthapuram, Thrissur, Kozhikode, and Kottayam.Roy became a household name in Kerala through his entry into the entertainment industry. As early as 2007, he sponsored an apartment worth Rs 1 crore for the winner of a reality music show on Asianet. Since then, Confident Group regularly sponsored winners of reality shows, including a reward of Rs 10 lakh for the winner of the Bigg Boss Malayalam series this year.He also funded over 10 films in Malayalam and Kannada, including Casanovva, Marakkar: Arabikadalinte Simham, Mei Hoom Moosa, Rangappa Hogbitna, Krazy Loka, and Radhana Ganda.The group sponsored international sports teams, including the West Indies cricket team (2013–14) and the Sri Lankan cricket team during the 2016 ICC World Cup. In 2022, Roy’s group also organised global movie awards in Dubai, Singapore, and India, further formalising its presence in the entertainment sector.Beyond business, Roy supported charity initiatives and cultural events and was active in rebuilding houses after the devastating 2018 Kerala floods. He also showcased his lifestyle, including high-end cars and chopper rides, on social media.","Roy chiriankandath joseph, popularly known as cj roy, 57, was born in kerala and raised in bengaluru.

Nicholas Lee Plumb, a Texas Republican candidate, who announced that he was affected by the latest layoff of Amazon, shared an internal message claiming that it was sent to him by a former colleague, where a discussion about a new engineering team in India was going on. ""We are also forming a new engineering team in India to accelerate product development while supporting operational and data engineering needs,"" the purported message read. The claim, not verified, went viral as many similar claims surfaced that only US employees in certain teams were impacted etc.Amazon announced reductions of 16,000 and called it the organizational changes that started in October. ""The reductions we are making today will impact approximately 16,000 roles across Amazon, and we're again working hard to support everyone whose role is impacted. That starts with offering most US-based employees 90 days to look for a new role internally (timing will vary internationally based on local and country level requirements). Then, for teammates who are unable to find a new role at Amazon or who choose not to look for one, we'll provide transition support including severance pay, outplacement services, health insurance benefits (as applicable), and more,"" Beth Galetti, senior vice president of People Expertise and Technology at Amazon wrote in her blog.""While we’re making these changes, we’ll also continue hiring and investing in strategic areas and functions that are critical to our future. We’re still in the early stages of building every one of our businesses and there’s significant opportunity ahead,"" Galetti clarified that there is no freeze in hiring.Speaking about his own layoff, Plumb earlier said that it was neither performance not AI that led to the layoffs. ""It’s enabled by a global labor market with almost no guardrails. Companies aren’t just competing on products anymore, they’re arbitraging labor across borders, wages, benefits and worker protections. When replacement is cheaper than retention, the decision gets framed as a strategy instead of consequence,"" he said.""AI becomes the excuse, not the cause. It’s the clean narrative that hides what’s actually happening: experienced workers being swapped out through global labor substitution while leadership talks about “efficiency” and 'the future of work',"" he added.The layoff announcement came weeks after Amazon allowed H-1B workers who got stuck in India because of visa stamping delay to work remotely.","A texas republican candidate, who announced that he was affected by the latest layoff of amazon, shared an internal message claiming that it was sent to him by a former colleague.

Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis says he is very proud of Apple partnership as iPhone maker ran a very…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ai-ceo-demis-hassabis-says-he-is-very-proud-of-apple-partnership-as-iphone-maker-ran-a-very/articleshow/127678468.cms,"Apple has chosen Google's Gemini AI for its foundation models, a multi-year deal reportedly worth around $1 billion annually. This partnership, confirmed this month, signifies a major shift for Apple, which previously favored in-house development. The revamped Siri, powered by Gemini, is expected with iOS 26.4, aiming for a March/April rollout.

Apple weighed options from OpenAI and Anthropic before settling on Google

Hassabis sees room for the partnership to grow





Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis isn't hiding his satisfaction over the Apple deal. In an interview with Alex Heath, Hassabis said he's proud that Gemini came out on top after Apple put multiple AI providers through a thorough evaluation. He added that Google has ideas for efficient AI models that could work well on edge devices like phones and even in robotics.The multi-year partnership, confirmed earlier this month, means Apple's foundation models will now be built on Gemini and Google's cloud technology. A joint statement from both companies said Apple found Google's AI to be the most capable option available. The models will still run on Apple devices and its Private Cloud Compute infrastructure, keeping the company's privacy commitments intact.According to Bloomberg, Apple is shelling out roughly $1 billion a year for a custom 1.2 trillion parameter Gemini model. The company evaluated offerings from Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reported that OpenAI was never really in the running, while Anthropic led early discussions before pricing talks broke down.The Financial Times pegged the deal's total value at around $5 billion for Google, structured as cloud services rather than a straight licensing arrangement. The revamped Siri powered by Gemini is expected to arrive with iOS 26.4, which should hit beta in February before a wider rollout in March or April.Asked about where Google wants to place Gemini versus keeping it exclusive to its own products, Hassabis said it depends on the situation. He noted that Google still has an edge with first-party devices because it can tightly integrate models with product surfaces. But he made clear the company is keen on enterprise business and deeper collaborations with partners that bring strong ecosystems to the table.For Apple, the deal represents a notable departure from its usual playbook of building everything in-house. The company pushed back its major Siri overhaul from spring 2025 to 2026 and moved AI chief John Giannandrea away from product development. The partnership also builds on a long history between the two tech giants—Google already pays Apple billions annually to remain the default search engine on iPhones.","Apple has chosen google's gemini ai for its foundation models, a multi-year deal reportedly worth around $1 billion annually.
