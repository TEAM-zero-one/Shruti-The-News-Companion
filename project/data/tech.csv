MobiKwik loses Rs 40 crore in 48 hours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mobikwik-loses-rs-40-crore-in-48-hours/articleshow/123933014.cms,"GURGAON: Taking advantage of what is believed to be a glitch that blindsided city-based digital wallet company MobiKwik's systems, around Rs 40 crore were allegedly siphoned off over two days, Sept 11 and 12, from the company's account through a blitz of UPI transactions.The fraud came to light on Tuesday after the arrest of six men whose accounts contained Rs 9 lakh of this stolen money. Uncannily, this is the second time this has happened to MobiKwik. In Oct 2017, the company was allegedly similarly defrauded of around Rs 19 crore with the money being moved to thousands of personal bank accounts. This time, the glitch happened after the company updated its software earlier this month, investigators said. It apparently allowed Mobikwik users to send much higher amounts of money than their wallet balances. Transactions, the investigators said, also went through if users entered incorrect PINs.Police said how scamsters came to know about this glitch is under probe. Officials said they suspected insiders' involvement. The fraud was reported on Sept 13 by a MobiKwik employee, citing an audit that had detected suspicious transactions on Sept 11 and 12.According to cops, fraudulent transfers over those two hours amounted to Rs 40.2 crore. ""Nearly 5 lakh transactions took place on Sept 11-12, and so far, 2,500 bank beneficiary accounts have been identified. We have managed to freeze Rs 8 crore out of the total fraud amount. This money was deposited in these bank accounts,"" said a source.Five of the arrested men are from Nuh. The other is from Palwal. The accused have been identified as Rehan, Waqar Yunus, Wasim Akram, Mohd Amir, Mohd Ansar and Mohd Sakil. All six have been sent to judicial custody.Police spokesperson Ashok Kumar said if any company employee is found to be involved in the scam, strict action will be taken against the individual. Nuh police on Tuesday, meanwhile, asked people to report by Sept 23 any unexplained cash transfers they might have received in their accounts.""If anyone received transactions on Sept 11 and 12 due to technical security lapses or other reasons via the Mobikwik app or received unauthorised payments through the app and wishes to return them, or has any complaints related to such transactions, they can visit the office of the SP. People from Palwal district and other Mewat areas can also come."" Nuh police said in a statement. They have been charged under Section 318(4) (cheating) and 314 (dishonest misappropriation of property) of BNS. Cops are also coordinating with banks to recover the money and identify others who benefited from the alleged fraud.""The company is undertaking all possible and necessary efforts to recover the amount. However, since the police investigation and recovery efforts have just started, it's not yet possible to ascertain the impact. Based on the preliminary data, as a risk mitigating measure, the FIR was lodged for an amount of Rs 40 crore, out of which, the company has recovered around Rs 14 crore. Thus, the estimated net impact is Rs 26 crore. The company is taking aggressive collection efforts while pursuing legal course of action to recover the full amount over a period of time,"" a company spokesperson told TOI.","The fraud came to light on tuesday after the arrest of six men whose accounts contained rs 9 lakh of this stolen money.

French luxury conglomerate Kering confirmed Monday that hackers accessed customer data from several of its high-end brands, including Gucci, Balenciaga, and Alexander McQueen, potentially affecting 7.4 million customers worldwide. The cybercriminals, identified as the notorious ShinyHunters group, stole names, email addresses, phone numbers, home addresses, and detailed spending records showing individual purchase amounts ranging from thousands to over $80,000.The Paris-based company, which discovered the breach in June, said no financial information including credit card details or bank account numbers was compromised. Kering has notified affected customers and relevant data protection authorities across multiple countries, though it declined to specify which regions were impacted.The Kering incident represents the latest in a wave of cyberattacks targeting luxury brands throughout 2025. The breach occurred in April during a period when hackers also successfully targeted other premium retailers, including Cartier owner Richemont and LVMH brands like Louis Vuitton, which suffered a separate data leak affecting 419,000 customers.ShinyHunters, communicating through encrypted messaging app Telegram, claimed responsibility for the attack and allegedly attempted to extort Kering for ransom payments in Bitcoin.The company denied engaging in any negotiations with the criminals, following law enforcement guidance against paying ransoms.The stolen data poses particular risks for high-spending customers, as detailed purchase histories could make them targets for secondary scams and sophisticated social engineering attacks. Some customer records analyzed showed spending patterns exceeding $30,000 across individual luxury brands.Cybersecurity experts at Google previously warned about ShinyHunters' tactics, which typically involve tricking employees into revealing login credentials for internal systems.

Grand Theft Auto VI expected to generate nearly $8 billion within two months of its release







As anticipation builds for the release of Grand Theft Auto VI on May 26, 2026, a new leak has surfaced online revealing that Rockstar Games may be introducing a new feature called real-time character aging — a mechanic that could redefine immersion in open-world gaming. As per multiple online reports, the new feature would enable players to witness their protagonists age physically and emotionally within the game’s universe.This also means that with this new feature in place it also means that users will be able to notice visible changes in facial features, body composition, and possibly even voice — a stark departure from the static character models of previous GTA titles.Fans of Rockstar’s Red Dead Redemption 2 will recall its subtle realism: Arthur Morgan’s beard grew, his weight fluctuated based on diet, and injuries left lasting marks. While RDR2 didn’t include full aging, it laid the groundwork for life-simulation elements that made the world feel alive. GTA 6’s rumoured aging system could take that concept further — turning cosmetic changes into a core gameplay mechanic.Apart from aging, the leak also suggest that GTA 6 will get various other features such as:Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6) is set to launch in May next year.

‘Scripted!’: Are Tyler Robinson’s texts with his trans partner 'fake'? What the internet is claiming,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/scripted-are-tyler-robinsons-texts-with-his-trans-partner-fake-what-the-internet-is-claiming/articleshow/123933545.cms,"Text messages between Tyler Robinson and Lance Twiggs have been revealed.





Text messages released by prosecutors in the case of Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused of assassinating conservative activist Charlie Kirk, have fuelled a storm of scepticism online. While prosecutors say the exchanges between Robinson and his transgender partner reveal his planning, motive and fears, critics argue the messages are “doctored” and “scripted.”Right-wing commentator Candace Owens was among the first to question their authenticity. “These messages are clearly doctored,” she wrote, accusing the government of cherry-picking texts to fit a narrative. “They should be released with timestamps and every single message made public.”On X, the debate has only intensified. “Extremely fake. They planned this text exchange as a cover-up. Very scripted,” wrote one user, while another said: “This sounds scripted, I bet they planned this out beforehand to make it sound like the boyfriend wasn’t involved.” Others mocked the tone of the messages, with comments like: “I’ve never once heard an engineer talk like this” and “What 22 year old would text like this???? What person who isn’t a robot would text like this??”Some fixated on specific language, pointing to Robinson’s references to “my love” and “my old man” as unconvincing.One user argued that the absence of emojis was proof enough: “The messages between Tyler Robinson and his trans chick are either fake or scripted because there is not a single emoticon.” Another account dismissed them as “transcribed by the FBI,” while one sceptic went further: “These alleged text messages between Tyler Robinson and his conveniently trans 'lover' are unquestionably fake. AIs agree. They read like a badly written playscript with a rightwing agenda.”Despite the online claims, prosecutors insist the messages form part of the evidence linking Robinson to the killing. Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray said Robinson’s DNA was found on the trigger of the bolt-action rifle used to fatally shoot Kirk at Utah Valley University on 10 September. Robinson also left a note saying he had “the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and I’m going to take it.”Court records show Robinson had admitted in texts to planning the attack “a bit over a week.” Prosecutors allege he later told his partner to delete the messages and stay silent if approached by police. Charged with aggravated murder and facing the possibility of the death penalty, Robinson has yet to respond to the mounting claims that the evidence against him may not be all it seems.","Tyler robinson, 22, is accused of killing conservative activist charlie kirk.

With recent launches in Qatar and Oman, the GCC region is now a key player in UPI’s international growth, offering significant benefits to millions of Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) and Indian tourists.The UAE became the first country in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) to roll out UPI payments. In 2022, UPI became available via the NeoPay app, enabling Indian expats to link their international mobile numbers and perform transactions without the need for an Indian SIM card. Recently, in 2025, an important update was made, allowing Non-Resident Indians (NRIs) in the UAE to access UPI without the necessity of having an Indian mobile number. This milestone significantly improved the digital payment experience for the Indian diaspora and tourists in the UAE, offering familiar and convenient payment methods.Notably, UPI payments are accepted across retail outlets, supermarkets, transportation services, and tourist spots like Dubai Mall and Mall of the Emirates. Indian tourists—who make up a significant portion of the UAE's visitors—are expected to reach 5.29 million in 2024 alone. For them, UPI brings an instant and secure payment solution without the need for cash or international cards, streamlining cross-border transactions.In 2023, Oman became the seventh country to embrace UPI and RuPay, following Singapore, Nepal, the UAE, Bhutan, Malaysia, and France. The launch in Oman was marked by a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) signed between NPCI, NIPL, and the Central Bank of Oman (CBO) on October 4, 2022. This collaboration allows for real-time cross-border payments and the use of RuPay cards across Oman's ATM networks, POS terminals, and e-commerce platforms.With a significant number of Indian nationals living and working in Oman, UPI's introduction offers an efficient, cost-effective way for remittances to flow between India and Oman, a crucial feature for Indian expatriates.Qatar’s integration of UPI payments began in 2023, allowing Indian tourists and residents to pay at retail outlets, tourist attractions, and other commercial establishments using UPI-powered apps like Google Pay, PhonePe, and Paytm . In July 2024, the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) announced a partnership with Qatar National Bank (QNB), marking a major step towards UPI acceptance at QNB’s merchant network. This partnership ensures that Indian visitors to Qatar can enjoy a familiar and convenient payment experience.Qatar’s tourism industry, which sees a lot of Indian visitors, is about to get even more convenient with UPI payments. On September 16, 2025, Commercial Bank of Qatar teamed up with NPCI International Payments Limited (NIPL) to bring UPI QR code payments to its merchants. This makes paying easier for Indian tourists and strengthens Qatar’s push for a cashless economy.Saudi Arabia has been another important addition to the UPI network, with NRIs in the kingdom already able to link Saudi (+966) mobile numbers to their Indian bank accounts. This system facilitates cross-border remittances and everyday transactions through the UPI platform. Additionally, Indian expats living in Saudi Arabia can link their international mobile numbers to their NRE/NRO accounts, making it easier for them to use UPI apps such as PhonePe and Google Pay.One of the most appealing aspects of UPI for NRIs in the GCC is that it enables them to make transactions without needing an Indian mobile number. By linking an international mobile number to their NRE or NRO account, users can transfer funds to and from their Indian bank accounts through a variety of UPI-enabled apps, including PhonePe, Google Pay, Paytm, and BHIM.Here’s how you can set up UPI with an international mobile number:AU Small Finance Bank, Axis Bank, Canara Bank, City Union Bank, DBS Bank Ltd, Equitas Small Finance Bank, Federal Bank, HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, IDFC First Bank, IndusInd Bank, Kotak Mahindra Bank, Punjab National Bank, South Indian Bank, State Bank of India, Yes Bank.NPCI’s international arm, NPCI International Payments Ltd (NIPL), is driving the global expansion of UPI and RuPay. As of September 2025, UPI is live in 12 countries, including major trading partners like Singapore, Australia, the USA, and the UK. NIPL’s partnerships with institutions like QNB and Network International in the Middle East are pushing UPI deeper into global payment systems.With a focus on cross-border remittances and smoother experiences for international travelers, UPI is quickly becoming a key player in global fintech. These collaborations are helping promote India’s digital payments while supporting the growth of real-time payment systems worldwide.","Since 2022, upi has expanded to the gcc, with qatar and oman becoming the latest countries to join.

'Lasting change'

High demand





KALIAKRA: Faced with rising Black Sea temperatures that suffocate his mussels, Bulgarian farmer Nayden Stanev has been forced to change his ways -- shifting his seeding schedule and harvesting at cooler depths.Yet Stanev, a 56-year-old former marine commando, sees the fallout from climate change as both a threat and opportunity for his business.As bad as it is for Bulgaria's mussel farmers, their peers in the Mediterranean Sea have had to deal with even higher water temperatures.""We are better off,"" Stanev told AFP.Though the Balkan EU member still trails far behind major Mediterranean mussel producers such as Spain and Italy, it has taken the lead in the Black Sea.And it is less affected by marine heat waves, which have led to a sharp decline in Europe's mussel crop, according to experts.But the warmer waters are still a threat to Black Sea mussel farmers.""About 20 percent of the mussels didn't survive"" this year, Stanev said gravely, as empty shells piled up on deck of his old diesel boat.""Last year, it was a massacre -- 80 percent wiped out. The mussels literally suffocate in a sea that warms too fast,"" he added.Scientists say climate change is making marine heatwaves more frequent and powerful, and the Mediterranean region is warming faster than the global average.In July, the average surface temperature of the Mediterranean Sea was 26.79C, the hottest ever for that month, according to research centre Mercator Ocean International.During the same period, the average surface temperature in the Black Sea was 25.46C -- less than in the Mediterranean, though it is also warming.""When temperatures approach or exceed about 26C -- a threshold associated with mass mussel mortalities -- for extended periods during peak market seasons, it creates disruptions in the supply chain,"" John Theodorou, an expert at the University of Patras in Greece, told AFP.In the Black Sea, the surface temperature has risen by nearly two degrees in two years, according to Radoslava Bekova from the Institute of Oceanology at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.""The sea is undergoing lasting changes,"" she told AFP.She added prolonged warming periods, when the sea doesn't have time to cool down, weaken the mussels, making them more vulnerable to diseases.Together with his six employees, Bulgaria pioneer Stanev is on deck at dawn to harvest and deliver his mussels, with the season reaching its peak at the end of August.He set up his business more than 20 years ago in the bay of Cape Kaliakra, a prime location protected from currents.His phone ringing incessantly, Stanev jots down the orders on a small notebook.On this day, he has to deliver no fewer than 10 tonnes of mussels to cater to the demand of hundreds of restaurants and vendors in Bulgaria and neighbouring Romania.After a short trip from shore, the crew reaches the 200-hectare mussel farm.Black buoys float on the surface, with long tubular nets holding the shells attached to them.The men work in silence with synchronised gestures: one pulls the nets out of the water, another cleans them and a third sorts the shells.Mussel bags pile up, each containing about 800 kilogrammes, as cormorants scout for leftovers.When the boat returns to the quay in the early afternoon, several refrigerated trucks are already waiting, along with villagers with empty buckets, eager to buy fresh mussels for their families.While global production has continued to grow, it has been declining in the EU since 2018, according to data from the European Market Observatory for Fisheries and Aquaculture Products (EUMOFA).About 356,500 tonnes of mussels were harvested in the EU in 2023 -- about 21 percent fewer than in 2018, according to EUMOFA data.Spain led with 155,700 tonnes followed by Italy with 57,279 tonnes -- by comparison, Bulgaria accounted for about 1,100 tonnes.While European production fell over that period, their value increased almost 50 percent, standing at roughly 463 million euros in 2023.""This value gap has created opportunities for Black Sea mussel production,"" Theodorou said.","Bulgarian farmer nayden stanev has had to adjust the seeding schedule and work at greater depths.

Green steel ambition





Jindal Steel International has made a non-binding offer to acquire Thyssenkrupp’s steel division, the German conglomerate said Tuesday, in a move that could reshape Europe’s traditional steel landscape. The bid, details of which were not disclosed, sent Thyssenkrupp shares soaring nearly 8% in Frankfurt trade, AFP reported.The once-iconic German industrial major has been trying to exit its struggling steel arm — Thyssenkrupp Steel Europe (TKSE) — which has been battling high domestic costs and Asian competition. The group said it would “carefully review” the proposal from Jindal and pay “particular attention” to the implications for jobs.Juergen Kerner, a workers’ representative on Thyssenkrupp’s board, described the offer from the “growth-oriented” Indian steelmaker as positive for employees. “Jindal Steel has its own access to raw materials and expertise in the green transformation,” he said, urging a quick dialogue to resolve workforce concerns.TKSE, which announced plans last year to cut 11,000 jobs by 2030 — about 40% of its workforce — has been under pressure to find a long-term buyer or partner.The Indian offer could trigger a contest with Czech billionaire Daniel Kretinsky, who acquired a stake in the steel unit through his holding firm EPCG and had been in talks for a potential joint venture.Jindal, in its statement, said it was committed to green steel production, aligning with Thyssenkrupp’s shift towards low-emission operations. Narendra Misra, head of European operations at Jindal, said the aim was to “preserve and advance the 200-year-old heritage of Thyssenkrupp” while turning it into “the largest low-emission steel producer in Europe.”The German company has been building a new site in Duisburg to produce carbon-neutral steel, though CEO Miguel Lopez has warned of profitability challenges. Jindal pointed to its Oman project, due to start in 2027, as evidence of its commitment to large-scale green steel ventures.A spokesperson for EPCG declined to comment on the Indian bid, AFP reported. Thyssenkrupp has previously indicated talks with Kretinsky about a 50:50 joint venture were still ongoing.Offloading the steel business forms part of Thyssenkrupp’s wider plan to split itself into standalone businesses to improve profitability.","Jindal steel international has made a non-binding offer to acquire thyssenkrupp's steel division.
