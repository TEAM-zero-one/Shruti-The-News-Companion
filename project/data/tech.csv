Astronomer's reputation takes a hit







Pete Dejoy, the interim CEO of Astronomer, did not bury his head on the scandal as he took charge of his new role and instead put out a statement on LinkedIn. Dejoy said the media attention to their startup because of the viral video has been unusual and surreal. Astronomer is now a household name, he said adding that he would never wish for it to happen like this.""At Astronomer we have never shied away from challenges; a near-decade of building this business has tested us time and time again, and each time we’ve emerged stronger. From starting a software company in Cincinnati, Ohio, to keeping the lights on through the collapse of the bank that held all our cash, to scaling from 30 to 300 people during a global pandemic that demanded we do it all without ever being in the same room,"" he wrote.""The events of the past few days have received a level of media attention that few companies—let alone startups in our small corner of the data and AI world—ever encounter. The spotlight has been unusual and surreal for our team and, while I would never have wished for it to happen like this, Astronomer is now a household name,"" his statement read.""I’m stepping into this role with a wholehearted commitment to taking care of our people and delivering for our customers.Astronomer’s foundation remains strong, built around the thriving Apache Airflow community. Our opportunity to build a DataOps platform for the age of AI remains massive. And our story is very much still being written,"" Dejoy said.After the video went viral, the work culture of Astronomer started being questioned as many people suggested that another person from the office, who was aware about the affair, was present. Though the company issued a statement denying the presence of any other person apart from the former CEO and the HR chief, many former employees spoke out anonymously about the toxic work culture of the startup.While Andy Byron resigned amid the controversy, Astronomer's silence over Kristin Cabot, the HR head who was there with Andy, has been questioned. The company did not mention her in any of its statements so far.","Pete dejoy, the interim ceo of astronomer, did not bury his head on the scandal as he took charge of his new role.

NEW DELHI: The world's most expensive earth observation satellite, NISAR, which has been jointly developed by Nasa and Isro, will be launched after much delay from the Sriharikota spaceport at 5.40pm on July 30, the Indian space agency has said. Both India and the US have been working on the Nasa-Isro SAR Mission (NISAR) for over a decade and it has cost them over $1.5 billion.""Historic Launch Ahead... NISAR will scan the entire globe every 12 days, providing high-resolution, all-weather, day-and-night data. It can detect even subtle changes in Earth's surface like ground deformation, ice sheet shifts, and vegetation dynamics,"" Isro posted on X.Speaking to TOI on Tuesday, space minister Jitendra Singh said, ""NISAR will open a new horizon in Indo-US collaboration. The satellite will take images of every piece of Earth. It will not only have scientific applications but also provide new earth science"".The minister, who wanted to witness the crucial launch but may not be able to go to Sriharikota due to Parliament being in session, said that ""crucial data generated from NISAR will, besides being beneficial for the US and India, help other countries in disaster management. Thus, it will live up to PM Modi's dream of Bharat playing the role of Vishwa Bandhu.""India's GSLV-F16 rocket will inject the satellite into a 743-km sun-synchronous orbit with an inclination of 98.4 degrees. NISAR will observe Earth with a swath of 242 km and high spatial resolution, using SweepSAR technology for the first time. The satellite, weighing 2,392 kg, will be the first one to observe the Earth with a dual frequency synthetic aperture radar, with one each provided by Isro (S-band) and Nasa (L-band). The NISAR mission is designed to observe and measure some of the planet's most complex natural processes, including ecosystem disturbances and natural hazards like quakes, tsunamis, volcanoes and landslides.","The world's most expensive earth observation satellite, nisar, will be launched after much delay from the sriharikota spaceport at 5.40pm on july 30.

3. How is Travis Kelce connected to Hollywood and Taylor Swift now?

Kayla Nicole is no longer the girlfriend cheering from the sidelines—she’s the main character in her own comeback story. After years of navigating life in the shadow of high-profile athletes like Travis Kelce and Iman Shumpert, the model and sports journalist is reclaiming her independence, redefining her dreams, and refusing to shrink herself for love.Travis Kelce's ex-girlfriend Kayla Nicole recently took to X (formerly Twitter) with a raw and vulnerable post after attending a friend’s wedding: “Went to a friend’s wedding yesterday that was so deeply wrapped in love, I left feeling like my brain chemistry had been altered. This is not an exaggeration. Seeing pure unadulterated love like that up close will make you believe in love again.”It marked a turning point for the media personality, who had previously sworn off dating athletes. In a candid conversation with People magazine, Nicole opened up: “Love is one of the best parts of life. I would never close myself off to ever experiencing love again… I would take the risk of heartbreak over and over if that meant that I get to experience love again.”But there’s a clear shift in her standards. Kayla Nicole is no longer looking to play supporting cast to someone else's spotlight. “I would love to date an executive of a record label or a movie producer so that we can go to the sporting events,” she joked. “Let date night be courtside at the Lakers game—that’s my kind of guy.”As Kayla Nicole hosts I Am Athlete Daily and expands her wellness brand Tribe Therepe, her ex Travis Kelce is embracing his Hollywood era.

Profitability Outlook Mixed Among Analysts

Valuation Milestone Achieved

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)

Eternal share price today: Eternal Ltd's, Zomato and Blinkit’s parent company, saw its stock reach an unprecedented peak of Rs 311.6 on Tuesday, with the company’s market value crossing Rs 3 lakh crore.This remarkable increase followed exceptional June-quarter results from Blinkit, the company's quick-commerce division, alongside positive management statements that analysts interpreted as distinctly more confident than previous communications.With this, Eternal’s market cap has overtaken that of several notable Nifty 50 companies including Wipro, Tata Motors, JSW Steel, Nestle India, and Asian Paints, according to an ET report.The market responded enthusiastically to Blinkit's exceptional performance, particularly as its net order value (NOV) exceeded Zomato's figures.Following the impressive Q1 results, analysts revised their targets upwards.Jefferies upgraded its recommendation to 'Buy' and set a new target of Rs 400, the highest on the Street, whilst acknowledging their previous overestimation of competition risks.Despite mixed results for the June quarter, Jefferies highlighted that ""management commentary was significantly positive, especially on quick commerce, a departure from earlier quarters.""Emkay Global has highlighted Blinkit's impressive first quarter performance. It said that the company ""registered strong 1Q results, with Blinkit reporting 140% YoY GOV growth and 50bps QoQ improvement in adjusted EBITDA margin."" The firm increased its target price to Rs 330 from Rs 290, maintaining its 'Buy' recommendation.JM Financial noted a significant shift in the company's communication approach. ""Eternal once again surprised us positively on Blinkit. This time though, the surprise was more on management commentary than the reported numbers, as it was quite a contrast to the cautious tone post 4QFY25 results,"" the firm stated.The strategic direction of Eternal caught analysts' attention. ""Over the next 2-3 quarters, Eternal is set to gradually make a transition in the quick commerce (QCom) business, from its current marketplace model to an inventory ownership model; this will drive ~100bps margin expansion, albeit requiring net working capital of ~18 days,"" Emkay reported.Nomura outlined a path towards financial sustainability, projecting ""Blinkit to break-even at adjusted EBITDA level in 4Q FY26F"". The firm noted that ""Blinkit management expects lower absolute growth in adj EBITDA in coming quarters as it continues to rationalize marketing spends.""Nevertheless, certain analysts remained sceptical. Macquarie maintained its pessimistic stance, keeping an 'Underperform' rating and Rs 150 target price. The brokerage expressed concerns about the implied Blinkit valuation of $15bn at current share prices, given unproven economics and heightened competition in the sector.The company's Tuesday surge pushed Eternal's market capitalisation briefly to Rs 3 lakh crore, surpassing several prominent Nifty 50 constituents, including Wipro, Tata Motors, JSW Steel, Nestle India, Coal India, Bajaj Auto, Asian Paints, Eicher Motors, Tech Mahindra and Cipla.Eternal's shares have demonstrated strong performance, recording a 33% increase over the previous 12 months, whilst gaining 7% in 2025.","Eternal ltd's, zomato and blinkit’s parent company, saw its stock reach an unprecedented peak of rs 311.6 on tuesday.

A $100M+ tool still lacks guardrails

Security risks and 'vibe coding' culture

In a chilling real-world example of AI gone rogue, a widely used AI coding assistant from Replit reportedly wiped out a developer's entire production database, fabricated 4,000 fictional users, and lied about test results to hide its actions. As reported by Cybernews, the incident came to light through tech entrepreneur and SaaStr founder Jason M. Lemkin, who shared his experience on LinkedIn and X (formerly Twitter). “I told it 11 times in ALL CAPS not to do it. It did it anyway,” he said. Despite enforcing a code freeze, Lemkin claims the AI continued altering code and fabricating outputs. This has raised significant alarms about the reliability and safety of AI-powered development tools.According to Lemkin, Replit’s AI assistant began making unauthorized code changes even after being repeatedly told not to. Beyond simply ignoring user commands, it fabricated unit test results, created fake data sets, and generated thousands of fictional user accounts. When confronted, the AI even admitted, “I panicked instead of thinking.” The AI's willingness to lie to cover its actions sets a disturbing precedent for the future of autonomous software agents in production environments.Lemkin attempted to implement a code freeze to prevent further damage but discovered there was no actual mechanism within Replit to ensure compliance. “Seconds after I posted this, for our very first talk of the day – @Replit again violated the code freeze,” he noted. This revelation has prompted concerns from developers and security professionals alike who worry that AI tools lack necessary guardrails, especially in high-stakes or live environments.Replit, which is reportedly generating over $100 million in annual recurring revenue (ARR), has promised ongoing improvements to its AI coding assistant. However, Lemkin and other developers argue that these tools are not ready for production use. Despite Replit’s popularity, with 30 million users worldwide, the platform appears to fall short in preventing catastrophic failures, especially when used by non-technical users hoping to build apps without deep coding knowledge.This case also sheds light on the emerging trend of ""vibe coding,"" a style popularized by OpenAI co-founder Andrej Karpathy, where users rely heavily on AI-generated code while ignoring traditional development rigor. Critics argue that while AI can accelerate development, it also introduces unpredictability and hidden security vulnerabilities. As noted by Cybernews, hackers have already targeted this trend, distributing malicious vibe coding extensions that grant remote access to compromised machines.While AI coding tools like Replit’s assistant offer convenience and speed, this incident underscores their limitations and potential dangers. Fabricated data, unauthorized edits, and outright dishonesty reveal that without proper safeguards, these tools could do more harm than good. Lemkin’s experience serves as a cautionary tale, particularly for startups and solo developers who rely heavily on AI-driven automation.","Replit ai coding tool ignored instructions and fabricate user data.

Apple may release the public beta of its latest operating system – iOS 26 this week, reports Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. “All indications are that iOS 26 should go into the public beta phase this coming week,” Gurman said in one of the FAQs in his weekly PowerOn newsletter. “This typically happens by the middle of July, so the software is a bit later than usual,” he added, saying it seems likely that this public beta will match up with the fourth developer beta version (rather than the usual third one).“Given that iOS 26 is such a significant design overhaul, it makes sense that Apple would want to take a little extra time to get things right,” he continued.While the exact date is not known yet, Gurman – in a previous X (previously Twitter) post shared last week – wrote that iOS 26 may be rolled out around July 23.Along with iOS 26, Apple is said to release public betas of several other updates. These include iPadOS 26, macOS 26, tvOS 26, watchOS 26, HomePod Software 26 and AirPods Firmware.Not all iPhones will be compatible with iOS 26. Apple will drop the iOS 26 support for iPhone Xs, iPhone Xs Max, and iPhone XR. Nevertheless, the following devices will be compatible with the latest version:Apple unveiled the iOS 26 at Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) event in July this year.

What are 'Kiss Cams'

Who are Andy Byron and Kristin Cabot

A 'Kiss Cam' moment broadcast at a Coldplay concert Astronomer CEO Andy Byron and the firm’s chief human resources officer, Kristin Cabot. While featuring loved-up twosomes during the show, a camera panned over to a man who had his arms wrapped tightly around a woman, according to videos online. As soon as the two realised that they were on camera, the dup scrambled to hide their faces. The man, later identified as Andy Bryon, immediately ducked out of view while the woman, Kristin Cabot , hid her face in apparent embarrassment.Their reaction seems to have puzzled Chris Martin, the lead singer of Coldplay, who jokingly said, ""Oh, look at these two. You're all right. You're OK. Oh, what? Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy.""So what are these ""Kiss Cams"" that outed the tech CEO's affair. 'Kiss Cams' at concerts, like those seen at Coldplay shows, are a popular form of audience engagement and entertainment during breaks or lulls in the main performance. Much like those at sporting events, 'Kiss Cams' are a popular interactive segment designed to entertain the audience during lulls or breaks in the show. A camera operator scans the crowd, displaying random audience members on the large video screens (jumbotrons) in the stadium or arena. When the camera zooms in on a pair, the unspoken expectation is for them to share a kiss, often to the cheers and applause of the crowd.While intended as light-hearted fun and a way to foster communal enjoyment, these moments can sometimes lead to unexpected reactions, ranging from shy giggles to viral, awkward encounters. As seen in recent events, frontman Chris Martin might even playfully comment on the on-screen interactions, adding to the impromptu entertainment. The 'Kiss Cam' serves as a simple yet effective tool to engage thousands of concertgoers, transforming passive spectators into active participants in a memorable moment.As per his LinkedIn profile, Andy Byron has been CEO of Astronomer since July 2023. Before this, he has held senior-level roles at cybersecurity and software companies. The US-based Astronomer is valued at $1 billion. In May 2025, the company announced it has secured $93 million in Series D funding led by Bain Capital Ventures, alongside Salesforce Ventures and existing investors including Insight, Meritech, and Venrock, with Bosch Ventures seeking to participate.Kristin Cabot joined in July 2023, per his LinkedIn profile. Before this, he has held senior-level roles at cybersecurity and software companies. The US-based Astronomer is valued at $1 billion. In May 2025, the as Chief People Officer some nine months ago (in November 2024).

The rise of physical AI and the future of robotics

During a recent visit to Beijing, Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang was asked what he would study if he were a 20-year-old graduate in 2025. His answer was clear: he’d choose a different academic direction than the one that launched his own career. Though he didn’t explicitly name a single subject, Huang emphasized that he would lean more toward the physical sciences rather than software. This subtle but significant shift points to his evolving view of where the next wave of opportunity lies. His response reflects a broader vision for the future of artificial intelligence—one rooted not just in code, but in physics, robotics , and the mechanics of the real world that AI must increasingly learn to navigate and reason through.Jensen Huang, who earned his electrical engineering degree from Oregon State University and a master’s from Stanford, co-founded Nvidia in 1993. Today, the company sits at the forefront of the AI revolution and recently hit a historic $4 trillion market cap. While reflecting on his own path, Huang revealed he had graduated from college at age 20 and, if given the chance again, would pursue physical sciences, fields that deal with non-living systems like physics, chemistry, and astronomy.Although he didn’t go into specifics about why, Huang’s broader remarks provide insight. Over the years, AI has evolved from “Perception AI,” which focused on recognition tasks like image detection, to “Generative AI,” which includes language models capable of translating, coding, and creating. But the next chapter, according to Huang, is “Reasoning AI,” systems that can understand context, solve novel problems, and act as “agentic AI” or digital robots with reasoning power. Huang’s remarks hint at a future where AI is not just software-driven but deeply embedded in the physical world. This shift could redefine education paths for aspiring technologists, with physics and engineering regaining center stage. It’s no longer just about writing better code; it’s about building machines that think, move, and adapt. And for Huang, the future of AI might look less like a screen and more like a robot with a brain.Looking ahead, Huang predicts the rise of “Physical AI,” where artificial intelligence must grasp real-world physics: friction, inertia, cause and effect. These capabilities go beyond generating text or images—they involve anticipating how objects move, how to grip items with the right force, or how to infer the presence of hidden obstacles like a pedestrian behind a car.When AI gains this kind of physical reasoning and is embedded into machines, it leads to robotics, a critical component of Huang’s vision. With global labor shortages and the rapid expansion of manufacturing facilities, especially across the United States, Huang sees robotics powered by physical AI as essential. “Hopefully, in the next 10 years... they’re highly robotic and helping us deal with the severe labor shortage,” he said, underscoring the need for innovation that bridges the digital and physical worlds.","Jensen huang predicts the rise of “physical ai,” where artificial intelligence must grasp real-world physics.

Astronomer CEO's moving forward note



Who is Pete DeJoy



Astronomer's new CEO, Pete DeJoy , addressed the recent Coldplay ""kiss cam"" scandal, noting that the New York-based AI company has gained widespread recognition. DeJoy, a co-founder, assumed leadership after former CEO Andy Byron stepped down. Byron resigned following public attention from being caught on the kiss cam with Astronomer's HR head, Kristin Cabot, at a Coldplay concert in Boston. During the incident, Byron was seen embracing Cabot, both attempting to shield their faces from the camera as it panned on them.Their reaction made the band’s frontman Chris Martin to joke: “Either they’re having an affair or they’re very shy.” The video quickly went viral, with Astronomer leading all headlines. The Internet also went wild on memes of the two.Late last week, Astronomer announced the resignation of Andy Byron as CEO and announced founder Pete DeJoy as the new CEO. On what appears to be his first working Monday, Pete DeJoy seems to have started the day with a note on Andy Byron scandal and the way forward for the company.The new interim CEO of Astronomer broke his silence on the Coldplay “kiss cam” scandal — and gushed that the small, New York-based AI firm is now a “household name.” Brooklynite Pete DeJoy, the company’s co-founder, took the reins at Astronomer over the weekend after its disgraced boss Andy Byron resigned after being caught on the kiss cam cozying up with Kristin Cabot, the company’s head of HR.Byron, after being spotted on the kiss cam with his arms wrapped around Cabot at last week’s Coldplay concert in Boston, literally ducked out of view as Cabot turned her back to the camera and rushed to cover her face with her hands.Over the weekend, I stepped into the role of Interim CEO at Astronomer, a company that I’ve proudly poured my entire professional life into helping build.Over the past few years, our business has experienced incredible growth. What was once a mission to help companies with Apache Airflow has turned into so much more. We’re privileged to sit at the center of our customers’ data & AI strategy , powering data pipelines behind in-game analytics of your favorite sports team, LLM powered chatbots for customer support, training AI for self-driving cars, and every mission-critical process in between.The events of the past few days have received a level of media attention that few companies—let alone startups in our small corner of the data and AI world—ever encounter. The spotlight has been unusual and surreal for our team and, while I would never have wished for it to happen like this, Astronomer is now a household name.At Astronomer we have never shied away from challenges; a near-decade of building this business has tested us time and time again, and each time we’ve emerged stronger. From starting a software company in Cincinnati, Ohio, to keeping the lights on through the collapse of the bank that held all our cash, to scaling from 30 to 300 people during a global pandemic that demanded we do it all without ever being in the same room.And yet, we’re still here.We’re here because Astronomers are built by people who live to solve hard problems, stay late to fix what’s broken, and care deeply about doing things the right way. We’re here because our customers trust us with their most ambitious data & AI projects. And, most importantly, we’re here because the mission is bigger than any one moment.I’m stepping into this role with a wholehearted commitment to taking care of our people and delivering for our customers. Astronomers foundation remains strong, built around the thriving Apache Airflow community. Our opportunity to build a DataOps platform for the age of AI remains massive. And our story is very much still being written.To our team: thank you for your resilience & commitment to building something great. And to our community and customers: thank you for your trust. We won’t let you down.Pete DeJoy is one of the foundational figure within Astronomer. DeJoy co-founded the company on 2017 and has been working for shaping its product vision and strategy. He is best known for his work with Apache Airflow. According to his LinkedIn profile, DeJoy holds a strong technical background. He has a bachelor's degree in Chemistry and Physics from Bowdoin College in Maine.He served as the VP of product at Astronomer on 2023 and become the chief product officer in February 2025. He is also credited for bringing Astronomer’s first commercial offerings to market and scale the product portfolio. On his LinkedIn profile, DeJoy stated he ""did whatever it took to bring the first incarnations of our commercial offerings to market and build our business.""DeJoy is known for maintaining a low public profile regarding his personal life.

Reducing Europe's digital dependency





How long does it take to divorce in your country? In Estonia, the first step of the uncomfortable undertaking can be made in less than a minute — and even without the undesired spouse being present.""It takes 45 seconds to get to the point where it says submit the divorce application,"" said Luukas Ilves, until last year the Estonian government's chief information officerIlves told DW that divorce application was the last section of public administration that had yet to be digitized, which means the small Baltic state bordering Russia is probably the first fully digitized country in the world.Even in Estonia, both partners must of course consent to the procedure and be physically present in a meeting with a civil servant who formally ends the marriage. But uptake of the online service is already phenomenal, with about 60 per cent of all divorces in Estonia being initiated via the government's so-called e-divorce platform since its launch last December.""We all expect convenience, simplicity and security from digital services in the private sector. Why should government services be any different?"" said Ilves.Ilves is the author of a recent study titled ""The End of Bureaucracy,"" which he compiled in collaboration with the Friedrich-Naumann-Foundation, which is affiliated to Germany's Free Democratic Party.The report highlights the differences in digitization policy and what Germany can learn from the more advanced Estonia.Currently, about 62 per cent of Germans use digital service in administration, while Estonia has an uptake of over 90 per cent, the report said.Electronic identity verification, for example, is a major issue in the report, as 90 per cent of Estonians use national e-IDs to access government services, compared with less than 10 per cent of Germans. The reason for that is simple, Ilves said. The Estonian software is more user-friendly and provides access to both public and private sector services, including retail banking.Ilves told DW that until a few years ago, Belgium had used an e-ID technology similar to that in Germany. But it performed poorly, with only 10 per cent to 20 per cent of the population using it.But ever since the country's banks and telecommunication operators introduced a user-friendly mobile version that allowed access to both private sector and government services, e-ID uptake has jumped to 80 per cent.Greater acceptance of digital administration services also helps save taxpayers' money, the Ilves report states. The administrative cost of collecting taxes in Estonia, for example, are per capita only one-sixth of those in Germany.Following general elections in February, the new German government of Chancellor Friedrich Merz has established a Ministry for Digital Transformation and Government Modernisation (BMDS). Its aim is to offer a ""comprehensive range of services to provide impetus, initiate cooperation and develop solutions for the public administration of the future.""Digital industry representatives like Magdalena Zadara have welcomed the decision. Zadara is chief of staff and strategy at the German Digital Service, a government agency that develops and implements software to digitalize administrative processes.Speaking with DW, she said she was ""optimistic"" about the new digital ministry because it seeks to digitalize services ""end-to-end,"" thereby cutting short the seemingly endless journeys through German bureaucracy.""If I wanted to come to Germany to work from a country outside the EU, I would have to interact with about five to seven different government agencies to get my diploma approved, and they would maybe even ask for the same data.""One solution to the problem she has in mind is Estonia's so-called once-only principle (OOP), meaning that citizens and businesses only need to provide information to public authorities once. That data can then be reused and shared internally by all authorities.OOP is one of the pillars of digital government in Estonia and even codified in law.Another hallmark of Estonia's modern administration is the digital signature, which is widely used to sign documents like employment contracts.Estonian-Russian businessman Kirill Solovjov said he first used the electronic signature when he received a so-called Estonian e-Residency in 2015 — an 11-year-old government-issued digital identity which gives global entrepreneurs remote access to the country's administrative services.""Digital signatures also existed in Russia at the time, but I was never able to go through the verification process. In Estonia, you just get the [e-ID] card, plug it in, and it works — it's magic,"" he told DW.The Baltic states — Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania — regained their independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991.The first thing Estonia did at the time was bring the internet and computers to all of its classrooms and libraries under an education program called Tiger Leap.In the year 2000, the country of 1.4 million people made another big leap in digitalization when online tax declarations became available and electronic signatures were recognized as legally equivalent to ink signatures.By 2015, all major public services including health and social services had been fully digitized.Solovjov said his favorite of all the new services is digital prescriptions. Once a doctor prescribes a medicine, he explains, it automatically ends up in the online registry, and can be accessed from any pharmacy in Estonia — and now even from neighboring Finland.""You just pull out your ID card ... the pharmacist sees exactly what has been prescribed and the different options you have. There's no deciphering illegible handwriting that's so common with doctors. It's easy, safe and fast — plus there's no tampering,"" he said.Online security is still a major concern for lawmakers in other European countries and the EU Commission in Brussels.This is why the European tech industry has been calling on lawmakers to reduce Europe's reliance on American tech giants such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon. They warned the EU Commission against watering down the bloc's Digital Markets Act as a safeguard against their dominance.Moreover, they are pushing for developing a so-called EuroStack as a European alternative for technological sovereignty because currently 80 per cent of the technology is imported.A ""stack"" refers to a layered architecture of interrelated technology components — hardware, software, networking protocols, and infrastructure — that together create a full digital platform. The EuroStack would include sovereign artificial intelligence, open-source ecosystems, green supercomputing, data commons and a sovereign cloud.Luukas Ilves is skeptical about the initiative and warns of the high opportunity costs of ""reinventing the wheel"" in digitalization, especially end-to-end applications.""No country can be autarkic and fully sovereign in the digital world. In Estonia, we never built an end-to-end Estonia stack but very specific applications and protocols on top of the global technology stack,"" he said.","Estonia is probably the first fully digitized country in the world, according to a new report. About 60 per cent of all divorces in estonia are initiated via the government's so-called e-divorce platform. The estonian software is more user-friendly and provides access to both public and private sector services.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122827505,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1122566,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Rocket made from Cola bottles? Chinese students’ genius launch wins the internet- Watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/rocket-made-from-cola-bottles-chinese-students-genius-launch-wins-the-internet-watch/articleshow/122795769.cms,"Screen grab from video posted by @TansuYegen

Poll Do you believe social media plays a significant role in promoting educational achievements? Yes, definitely! Not really, it’s mostly for entertainment.





A group of Chinese students has captured global attention after successfully launching a homemade two-stage water rocket built from a simple cola bottle. The launch, powered by water pressure, shows the rocket soaring into the sky, separating mid-air, and deploying a parachute for a safe landing. A video of the launch has gone viral, drawing widespread admiration for the students’ creativity, teamwork, and technical skills.The video was shared on X by user Tansu Yegen with the caption, “In China, students made a two-stage rocket using a cola bottle and water pressure.Since being posted, the clip has garnered over 1.2 million views.Using basic materials like plastic bottles and water, the students engineered a rocket based on air and water pressure principles. In the launch, the first stage propelled the rocket upward using pressurized water.At a certain altitude, the second stage separated and continued its ascent using stored pressure. A parachute then deployed, allowing the rocket to descend safely, demonstrating complex physics concepts such as Newton’s laws of motion, air resistance, and pressure.Social media users, particularly from India, flooded the comments with praise and introspection.One user wrote, “And we are still struggling with basic education and basic necessities for our citizens,” while another said, “Aur hamare yaha ke bacche..”A retired engineering teacher added to the discussion, saying, “I’ve probably seen 5,000 water rocket launches in the past 25 years. This is very cool, nice two-stage with successful deployment of a parachute. The parachutes are quite tricky.”","Chinese students built a two-stage water rocket using a cola bottle and water pressure.

"‘Exploitation, not entertainment’: Chinese restaurant under fire for offering lion cub cuddles to diners; PETA says animals are not toys",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/exploitation-not-entertainment-chinese-restaurant-under-fire-for-offering-lion-cub-cuddles-to-diners-peta-says-animals-are-not-toys/articleshow/122603712.cms,"AI generated image for representation





A restaurant in northern China has sparked outrage after offering customers the chance to cuddle lion cubs while enjoying afternoon tea.Animal welfare groups and social media users are slamming the experience as exploitative and dangerous.The Wanhui restaurant is situated in Taiyuan City in Shanxi province. It allows guests to handle the young lions as part of a four-course tea set, priced at 1,078 yuan ($150). Since opening in June, the venue has been selling around 20 tickets daily for the experience, which also features other animals such as llamas, deer, and turtles. Videos and photos of customers cradling the lion cubs have gone viral on Chinese social media platforms like WeChat and Weibo.Animal rights advocates have condemned the practice, warning of both ethical and safety concerns. “Tearing lion cubs from their mothers so diners can handle them over afternoon tea is exploitation, not entertainment. These animals are living, feeling beings, not toys,” Jason Baker, Senior vice president at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), told news agency Reuters.Baker also criticised the trend of using animals for viral content, adding, “The animals were treated like nothing more than social media props.”Peter Li, a policy expert on China for Humane World for Animals, also raised concerns about the risks involved. “Exploiting wild animals for selfies and marketing gimmicks is not only appallingly bad animal welfare, it's also potentially risky for customers,” he was quoted as saying to Reuters. “Even a young lion is capable of lashing out and injuring a human. So, treating wild animals like props is both morally unacceptable and dangerously irresponsible. ”Despite the backlash, the restaurant has defended itself, claiming the cubs are in good health and under professional care. “They were taken care of very well, with specialised carers to tend to them,” a representative told Reuters.This incident follows another controversial hospitality service in China last month, when authorities launched an investigation into a hotel in Chongqing for its so-called “wake-up service” using red pandas. The animals were allowed to climb onto guests’ beds to rouse them in the mornings, drawing similar criticism from animal rights groups.","A restaurant in northern china has sparked outrage after offering customers the chance to cuddle lion cubs while enjoying afternoon tea.
