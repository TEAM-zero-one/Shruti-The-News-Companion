NEW DELHI: Isro‚Äôs second spaceport outside Andhra Pradesh‚Äôs Sriharikota, which is coming up at Kulasekarapattinam coastal town in Tamil Nadu‚Äôs Thoothukudi district, will see its maiden launch of a small satellite launch vehicle (SSLV) or mini-PSLV within 24 months, space agency chairman V Narayanan said on Monday. The new spaceport will enhance India‚Äôs capabilities in space launch services.‚ÄúAll facilities will be commissioned for launch in 24 months. The first launch will take place in two years. Don‚Äôt think it will be literally small in size. It will be a 500 kg satellite,‚Äù Narayanan said in Chennai after inaugurating a new research centre, ‚ÄòS Ramakrishnan Centre of Excellence for Research in Fluid and Thermal Science,' at IIT-Madras.In another big development, the Isro chairman on Sunday said the Centre has given approval for the ambitious Chandrayaan-5 mission as part of the country‚Äôs long-term goal of landing an Indian on the Moon by 2040. He highlighted the growing scope of India‚Äôs lunar exploration and the significance of Chandrayaan-5, which will feature a higher-capacity lander, essential for future missions, including potential human landings on the Moon.He said Chandrayaan-4 will focus on landing and collecting samples from the Moon, while Chandrayaan-5, which received approval just days ago, will deploy a 350 kg rover. This mission is part of a collaboration between India and Japan.During this year, Isro has planned a series of launches, including GSLV, a commercial satellite from the US, and unmanned test mission with humanoid as part of the Gaganyaan mission, Narayanan said.PM Modi had remotely laid the foundation stone for Kulasekharapattinam spaceport on Feb 28, 2024. The selection of this TN spaceport offers strategic advantages, particularly in enhancing payload capability with its direct southward launch trajectory for small launch vehicles. The new spaceport will house 35 facilities, including a launchpad, rocket integration facilities, ground range and checkout facilities, and a mobile launch structure (MLS) with checkout computers. It will have the capacity to launch 24 satellites every year using a mobile launch structure.Spread over 2,350 acres, the Kulasekharapatnam spaceport will help save fuel for small rocket launches as the port can launch rockets directly south over the Indian Ocean without requiring crossing landmasses.","Kulasekarapattinam coastal town in tamil nadu‚Äôs thoothukudi district will see its maiden launch of a small satellite launch vehicle (sslv) or mini-pslv within 24 months, space agency chairman v narayanan said.

‚ÄúAbsolutely no shot Stefon Diggs goes back to Buffalo lol‚Äù

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs giving desperateeeeeeü•±‚Äù

‚ÄúDidn't he burn whatever bridges he could find on his way out last time?‚Äù

Stefon Diggs has the internet doing double takes right now.

And if you know anything about social media tea, this kind of move isn‚Äôt just casual‚Äîfans are already losing their minds over what it could mean.When the Bills sent Diggs to the Texans in April, it didn‚Äôt seem like the smoothest of exits.

No posts, no memories‚Äîjust gone.Fast forward to now, and every single Bills-related photo has been restored. To make it even spicier, Diggs hasn‚Äôt said a word about it. No caption, no explanation‚Äîjust pure chaos for fans to interpret however they please.Theories are flying everywhere. Some die-hard Bills Mafia members are already manifesting his return, convinced that Diggs wants to undo the trade and come back to Buffalo. Others think it‚Äôs nothing more than a trip down memory lane, a way for him to acknowledge the good times without any actual football implications.Of course, there‚Äôs also the classic case of NFL players using cryptic social media moves to stir the pot.

GTA 6 Is Delayed (Kind Of)

Insider Hints at Delay

Development Hurdles = Delays?

Next-level game complexity.

Take-Two Reports: GTA 6 Confirmed for Fall 2025

Rockstar & Take-Two: Still Saying 2025 (But Are They?)

So, Will GTA 6 Be a 2026 Game?

does

Gamers have been counting down to GTA 6 ‚Äôs 2025 release, but with a fresh insider leak, we might be in for some heartbreak. Rockstar‚Äôs been eerily quiet since dropping the first trailer back in December 2023, and now, rumors are swirling that the highly anticipated game might actually be delayed until 2026.A well-connected Rockstar insider, @Mvbrr, recently claimed that a 2025 launch is looking ‚Äúunlikely‚Äù based on recent reports. This tracks with the growing unease in the community‚Äîwhy has there been zero marketing updates since that first trailer?Rockstar‚Äôs past behavior isn‚Äôt exactly reassuring either. Remember how GTA 5: Expanded & Enhanced was originally planned for late 2021 but got pushed to March 2022? Yeah, delays aren‚Äôt new for Rockstar.Jason Schreier, a journalist with a solid track record, has also weighed in. While he hasn‚Äôt confirmed the delay, he did acknowledge that GTA 6 has missed internal deadlines. And let‚Äôs be real‚ÄîRockstar games rarely launch on time. Red Dead Redemption 2? Delayed. GTA 5? Delayed. It‚Äôs basically tradition at this point.The reason?GTA 6 is their biggest, most ambitious project yet, and pushing boundaries means running into roadblocks. On top of that, reports suggest content revisions are happening, particularly around sensitive topics, which could be slowing things down.Officially, Take-Two Interactive insists that GTA 6 is still on track for a Fall 2025 release. But let‚Äôs be real‚Äîif a major game is actually hitting in a year, the marketing should be in full swing by now. Instead, we‚Äôve got radio silence.The first trailer broke records, showcasing Vice City and the new Bonnie & Clyde-inspired protagonists, but since then? Crickets. No new trailers, no gameplay reveals, and no official updates. That‚Äôs not a good sign.For now, Take-Two is sticking to its 2025 release promise‚Äîbut history tells us to stay skeptical. Between insider leaks, development struggles, and Rockstar‚Äôs lack of updates, the possibility of a 2026 delay feels very real.The good news? If Rockstarpush the release, it‚Äôs probably to make sure the game meets their ridiculously high standards. The bad news? We might have to wait even longer to step back into Vice City.For now, we‚Äôre all just refreshing Rockstar‚Äôs socials like maniacs and hoping for an update soon. Will GTA 6 really drop in 2025, or is a delay inevitable? Only time will tell.","A well-connected rockstar insider, @mvbrr, recently claimed that a 2025 launch is looking ‚Äúunlikely‚Äù based on recent reports.

Brock Boeser All Set For A Big Market, With Offensive Steadiness

Canucks Not Loving Boeser Trade Offers

LIVE | Patrik Allvin Trade Deadline Media Availability

Even as the Vancouver Canucks fight for a playoff spot, Boeser's future hangs in the balance. The talented winger will be heading to free agency this summer following the expiration of his three-year contract worth $19.95 million. While his concentration is currently on a strong finish to the season, contract negotiations with the Canucks seem yet to be underway. The general consensus is that as ceilings go up in NHL salary structures, Boeser could receive a sizable pay rise on the open market. So, the next move could be critical for both parties.Even if Brock Boeser's offensive production has been down this season, he is lining himself up for a big contract in free agency. To quote Johnston, ‚ÄúWith the salary cap due to take a significant jump this summer, Boeser would jump from a $6.65 million average annual value to a $7.65 million AAV just by securing the same percentage of cap (8.06 percent) as he got on his last RFA deal with Vancouver in 2022."" Basically, two forces are acting on this, one being the rising salary cap and the other the low supply of impact goal-scorers on the market.Boeser scored a career-high 40 goals and 73 points in the 2023-24 campaign but has been struggling this year, tallying just 38 points (18 goals and 20 assists) in 60 games. His numbers at present don't look terrific, but still, his goal-scoring ability alone will keep him in the mix for teams looking to add offensive flair.The Canucks looked into a trade for Boeser leading up to the NHL trade deadline, but GM Patrik Allvin was said to not be impressed by the offers on the table. In his comments, Allvin hinted there was a shocking lack of market for Boeser, adding that if criticized, ‚ÄúIf I told you what I was offered for Brock Boeser I think I would have to run out of here because you would not believe me.""Since the deadline, Boeser's play has only deteriorated, with calendars recording just one assist and tallying a -6 rating in six games. Uncertainty looms over his future, which means the Canucks must choose to either stay with him at an inflated price or make plans to walk away.Also Read : Kiefer Sherwood Calls Out Jason Dickinson for Dirty Hit on Filip Chytil Boeser is a marked man during the playoff push by the Canucks, and his contract status is paramount.

Shantanu Naidu‚Äôs bond with Ratan Tata shaped his commitment

Shantanu Naidu , the millennial executive who rose to fame for his stint as Ratan Tata 's personal assistant, recently posted adorable photos of him having an ""intergenerational Holi"" with senior citizens. Naidu, now promoted to General Manager and Head of Strategic Initiatives at Tata Motors, has always been passionate about social causes. Here, too, his observance of the festival of colours with older people is a reflection of his continuing love for uniting people from different generations.The organisation where Naidu spent Holi with the elderly is no other than Goodfellows India , a companionship organisation Naidu started. The aim of Goodfellows India is to offer a feeling of belonging and care to senior citizens who tend to live lonely lives because they lack family or loved ones. The organisation offers companionship and seeks to counter loneliness, giving a platform for senior citizens to feel connected and valued in society.On LinkedIn, Naidu posted pictures of the celebration, where older men and women celebrated the festival of colours, dancing and celebrating the occasion of Holi. He captioned the photo, ""Colouring outside the lines of age. A Happy intergenerational Holi from Goodfellows India,"" showing the celebratory mood of the event and the pleasure of uniting different generations.The photos were followed by smiling faces of elderly people, some of them laughing, others dancing, as they participated in the joy of Holi. The festival was not merely about colours; it was a moment of togetherness and acceptance for people who otherwise feel left out because of age or loneliness.Naidu's occasion was greeted with mass praise on social media. Numerous users praised the effort as a lovely instance of empathy and commitment towards truly making an impact in the world of senior citizens. One praised Naidu's initiatives and said, ""What a beautiful celebration! Your empathy and commitment at Goodfellows India are such an inspiration, Shantanu Naidu. Cheers to more colourful and fulfilling inter-generational connections.""Yet another user commented, ""This gesture is truly wonderful and a fantastic addition to society. Putting smiles on the faces of individuals who truly deserve them."" The atmosphere of positivity around Naidu's gesture highlights how crucial social gestures that put a smile on others' faces, who are most of the time neglected or are lonely, really are.While Naidu's professional career is replete with milestones, one of the most significant things about his career has been his personal equation with Ratan Tata, the erstwhile Tata Group chairman. In spite of being decades younger than Tata, Naidu developed an extremely close rapport with him, sometimes acting as his personal assistant and trusted advisor. Beyond the domain of professional obligation, Naidu used to describe Tata as his ""lighthouse,"" a guiding source in his life.After Tata's passing in 2023, Naidu made a moving tribute to his mentor, accompanying Tata's hearse during his last journey. In a touching post, Naidu wrote about his sadness and how much the loss hurt him. ""The void that this friendship has now left in me, I will spend the remainder of my life attempting to fill. Grief is the price we pay for love. Goodbye, my dear lighthouse,"" Naidu posted.Shantanu Naidu and Ratan Tata‚Äôs bond began over 10 years ago when Naidu first joined the Tata Group in 2014. Naidu worked on several initiatives with Tata to improve the welfare of stray animals and elderly citizens. His commitment to giving back to society is reflected in the values Tata instilled in him, and this dedication continues through his work with Goodfellows India.Apart from professional achievement, the values and personal development of Naidu, imparted to him under the guidance of Tata, have made him an individual focused on kindness and community influence. As he carries out his initiatives for Goodfellows India, Naidu continues to leave his indelible mark on society in such a way that not one senior citizen shall ever be ignored or forgotten.","Shantanu naidu is the general manager and head of strategic initiatives at tata motors.

The FBI and the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) have warned Gmail and Microsoft Outlook users about a dangerous ransomware scheme . Earlier this week, the US government agencies issued a warning regarding Medusa, a ransomware-as-a-service software responsible for attacks since 2021, which has recently impacted hundreds of individuals. CISA reports that Medusa primarily employs phishing campaigns to steal victims' credentials. Some of the recommendations that the agencies offered to protect against this ransomware include patching operating systems and keeping devices updated, using multi-factor authentication for services like email and VPNs, using strong passwords and avoiding frequent password changesAccording to the advisory (seen by the news agency AP), Medusa developers and affiliates, known as ‚ÄúMedusa actors,‚Äù employ a double extortion strategy, encrypting victims' data and threatening to expose the stolen information if the ransom isn‚Äôt paid. Medusa runs a data-leak site that lists victims with countdowns to the potential release of their data.the advisory noted.Furthermore, CISA highlighted that Medusa developers and affiliates have targeted over 300 victims across various industries, including healthcare, education, legal, insurance, technology, and manufacturing since last month.Last week, the FBI also warned about a surge in ""smishing"" attacks targeting iPhone and Android users. These scams use fraudulent texts to steal personal and financial data. Cybercriminals have registered over 10,000 domains, fueling a fourfold increase in attacks since January 2025, putting millions at risk of identity theft and fraud, the previous warning noted.","The fbi and us cybersecurity and infrastructure security agency (cisa) have warned gmail and microsoft outlook users about a dangerous ransomware scheme.

However, the company is reportedly still working towards a future where iPhones will be completely port-free. The iPhone 17 Air will serve as a precursor to this vision, featuring a significantly slimmer design. While Apple has been transitioning its iPhones from the proprietary Lightning port to USB-C, speculation continues regarding the timeline for a fully wireless iPhone.The concept of a portless iPhone has been discussed within Apple for years. Reports suggest that the company has been gradually moving towards a wireless ecosystem, with advancements in MagSafe charging and improved wireless data transfer speeds. According to Bloomberg‚Äôs Mark Gurman, Apple executives believe that if the iPhone 17 Air is successful, it will pave the way for completely port-free models in the near future.Apple supply chain analyst Ming-Chi Kuo had previously predicted that a portless iPhone would arrive as early as 2021, but technological and regulatory hurdles may have delayed its introduction. With USB-C now mandatory in the European Union, Apple may need to balance innovation with compliance before fully eliminating physical charging ports.While details about the iPhone 17 Air remain scarce, leaks suggest that it will feature an ultra-thin and lightweight design. Apple is expected to achieve this reduction in size by optimizing internal components, including a more compact battery and a redesigned logic board.Key rumored features of the iPhone 17 Air include:Apple has historically been a leader in eliminating hardware features before the industry catches up. The company previously removed the headphone jack with the iPhone 7, introduced Face ID in place of Touch ID on flagship models, and transitioned MacBooks to USB-C long before it became a global standard.By removing charging ports, Apple aims to:However, this transition may pose challenges for users who rely on wired charging and data transfer. Professional users who shoot high-resolution videos may find it difficult to transfer large files wirelessly without a fast alternative.A completely portless iPhone would need to comply with regional regulations, particularly in the European Union, where the Common Charger Directive mandates that all mobile phones support USB-C for wired charging. Apple could potentially circumvent this requirement if the device exclusively supports wireless charging.Additionally, consumer acceptance will play a key role in determining whether Apple moves forward with this change. Users who prefer the convenience of wired charging may be hesitant to switch to a wireless-only model, especially if charging speeds and accessory availability do not match current standards.The iPhone 17 Air is expected to be a stepping stone toward Apple‚Äôs long-term goal of a port-free iPhone lineup. If the model performs well in terms of sales and user adoption, future iPhones could follow suit, with Apple refining wireless technologies to fully replace wired alternatives.With MagSafe improvements and advancements in data transfer speeds, Apple is gradually laying the foundation for this shift. While the transition to a completely portless iPhone may not happen immediately, the iPhone 17 Air is a clear indicator of the company‚Äôs direction.Apple is set to unveil the iPhone 17 lineup in September 2025, where more details about the iPhone 17 Air and its potential impact on future iPhones will be revealed.","The iphone 17 air is expected to be a stepping stone toward apple‚Äôs long-term goal of a port-free iphone lineup.

Vikings Release Garrett Bradbury After Signing Ryan Kelly



Ryan Kelly Signs His Contract with Minnesota Vikings

The Minnesota Vikings have officially parted ways with center Garrett Bradbury after securing the services of veteran Ryan Kelly from the Indianapolis Colts. Bradbury's release marks a significant shift in the Vikings‚Äô offensive line strategy as they aim to strengthen their interior line with experienced talent.Garrett Bradbury, who was selected with the 18th overall pick in the 2019 NFL Draft, had been a consistent presence for the Vikings over the past six seasons. He started all 17 regular-season games last year, including a playoff appearance, and has made 88 starts out of a possible 100 games since joining the team. However, with the Vikings signing Kelly to a two-year deal with $9.235 million guaranteed, Bradbury's departure became inevitable.The Vikings will designate Bradbury's release as a post-June 1 move, which will free up $5.25 million in cap space while leaving $814,000 in dead money for the upcoming season. His current cap figure will remain on the books until June 2, so the additional cap room will only be available after that date. The Vikings‚Äô attempt to trade Bradbury fell through as no team was willing to take on his $4.09 million salary.Following his release, Bradbury has already been linked to the New England Patriots. According to ESPN‚Äôs Mike Reiss, the Patriots, who recently cut veteran center David Andrews, have shown interest in Bradbury. Reiss noted on Sunday that while the Patriots were not interested in trading for Bradbury due to his salary, they could actively pursue him now that he is a free agent.Bradbury, who will turn 30 in June, has had an up-and-down career in terms of performance. He was ranked as the 10th-best center in the league by Pro Football Focus during the 2022 season. However, his overall performance declined over the past two years, ranking 31st and 33rd among centers. Last season, Bradbury earned the 14th-highest run-blocking grade among centers, reflecting his solid contribution in the ground game despite his struggles in pass protection.The release of Bradbury is part of a broader effort by the Vikings to reshape their roster through aggressive moves in free agency. In addition to Ryan Kelly, the Vikings signed guard Will Fries and strengthened their defense by adding Jonathan Allen, Javon Hargrave, and cornerback Isaiah Rodgers. The team also brought in linebacker Eric Wilson and offensive tackle Justin Skule for added depth.The Vikings‚Äô front office remains active in the market, as evidenced by their recent free-agent visit with cornerback Jeff Okudah. The former third overall pick in the 2020 draft has struggled with injuries throughout his career but remains a high-upside talent. After playing for Atlanta in 2023 and Houston in 2024, Okudah is looking for a fresh start, and Minnesota could offer him that opportunity.Also Read: NFL teams make history with unprecedented move ahead of 2025 Draft after 55 years Bradbury's departure signals a new era for the Vikings‚Äô offensive line, with Ryan Kelly expected to bring more stability and leadership to the center position.

Dubai is rapidly advancing its sustainability agenda, positioning itself as a global leader in climate-conscious urban development. With the United Arab Emirates (UAE) committing to net-zero emissions by 2050, the emirate is undergoing a transformational shift in renewable energy, water conservation, and clean mobility. These developments are reshaping Dubai‚Äôs economic landscape and solidifying its role in the global sustainability movement.From electric vehicles (EVs) and green hydrogen production to smart energy grids and water conservation, Dubai invests in cutting-edge solutions to create a self-sustaining, green economy. The city is also attracting significant foreign interest, particularly from India, China, Europe, and the U.S., as companies seek to establish regional operations.‚ÄúWe are witnessing a significant push across three key sectors‚Äîelectric vehicles, water sanitation and hygiene, and alternative fuels,‚Äù said Chirag Gupta, Managing Partner at 8X Ventures. ‚ÄúThere have been multiple MOUs, LOIs, and high-level government discussions in these areas. Given the momentum, we expect capital to flow into these initiatives soon.‚ÄùA cornerstone of Dubai‚Äôs sustainability vision is the UAE Energy Strategy 2050, which aims to triple the contribution of renewable energy and invest AED 150-200 billion by 2030 to meet growing energy demand and ensure sustainable growth.This strategy aligns with the Paris Agreement and positions the UAE as a leader in the Middle East for carbon neutrality.Central to this initiative is the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, which is set to reach a 5,000 MW capacity by 2030, making it the largest single-site solar park globally. Once completed, the park is expected to reduce carbon emissions by approximately 6.5 million tonnes annually.His Excellency Saeed Mohammed Al Tayer, Managing Director and CEO of Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA), said in a press release, ‚ÄúIn Dubai, we recognise the critical importance of energy transformation. We have adopted a resilient and integrated methodology, combining solar power generation with advanced storage technologies while continuously improving operations across the entire value chain.To further these efforts, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum launched the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park, the world‚Äôs largest single-site solar park, in 2012. The solar park's planned capacity is set to increase from 1,000MW to 5,000MW by 2030. It houses a global Research and Development Centre and a Sustainability and Innovation Centre. DEWA has registered several international patents in electricity and water planning, production, transmission and distribution, alongside publishing Scopus-indexed research papers in international conferences and journals.‚ÄùApart from this, in 2016, Dubai launched the Al Sa'fat ‚Äì Dubai Green Building System, which classifies buildings such as Platinum, Gold, Silver, and Bronze based on their adherence to green standards. This system aims to encourage all developers to build toward a greener tomorrow, safeguarding future generations and enhancing the sustainability of the urban environmentBeyond energy and mobility, Dubai is leveraging agritech to drive sustainability and food security in the region. With arid climatic conditions and limited arable land, the emirate is investing in vertical farming, hydroponics, and AI-driven agricultural solutions to reduce water consumption and boost local food production.One of the standout projects is the Dubai Food Tech Valley, an initiative aimed at enhancing self-sufficiency by integrating research, technology, and sustainable farming practices. The city has also seen significant private sector investment, with companies like Emirates Crop One launching one of the world's largest vertical farms. Dubbed as ECO1, it produces over one million kilograms of leafy greens annually while using 95% less water than traditional farming.Craig Ratajczyk, the former CEO of Crop One Holdings, had earlier emphasised the company's mission and the role of their Dubai facility in a press notesaid - ""It‚Äôs our mission to cultivate a sustainable future to meet global demand for fresh, local food, and this new farm is the manifestation of that commitment. This new facility serves as a model for what‚Äôs possible around the globe.""By promoting controlled-environment agriculture (CEA) and reducing reliance on imports, Dubai is ensuring long-term sustainability while strengthening its position as a hub for agritech innovation.Dubai is also pioneering green hydrogen production, aligning with the UAE's goal to acquire 25% of the low-carbon hydrogen marketThis initiative is part of the National Hydrogen Strategy, which aims to position the UAE as a competitive producer and exporter of hydrogen.‚ÄúThe discussions around alternative fuels are substantial,‚Äù Gupta noted. ‚ÄúHydrogen, methanol, and other clean fuel solutions are actively being explored as viable substitutes for petrol and diesel. There‚Äôs extensive research happening, and Dubai is emerging as a key hub for these conversations.‚ÄùDubai is positioning itself as a regional hub for EV manufacturing, assembly, and distribution. Companies from China, the US, and India are in advanced discussions with the government about establishing EV production plants, tech centres, and distribution networks.‚ÄúSerious discussions are happening across the entire EV value chain,‚Äù Gupta said. ‚ÄúWe are seeing multiple government-level negotiations about setting up manufacturing hubs, R&D centres, and distribution partnerships. Dubai is actively working to build an EV ecosystem, and international companies recognise the city‚Äôs strategic location as a gateway to the wider Middle East and Africa.‚ÄùFor Indian companies, Dubai offers a lucrative market opportunity, but a transactional approach won‚Äôt suffice. ‚ÄúIf Indian companies want to succeed here, they must commit to the region,‚Äù Gupta emphasised.‚ÄúFlying in, making deals, and flying out isn‚Äôt sustainable. The UAE wants companies to set up production facilities, R&D centres, or corporate offices. The potential is immense, but companies need to be willing to integrate into Dubai‚Äôs economic landscape.‚ÄùAnmol Singh Jaggi, Co-founder, BluSmart, the premium electric mobility company that recently launched in Dubaihas said the UAE has been a game changer for mobility and sustainable solutions, setting a precedent for innovative urban development globally.Jaggi, also added, ‚ÄúThe Dubai market presents a highly attractive opportunity for BluSmart due to its potential for significantly higher margins and profitability compared to India. We identified a market gap in the premium limousine segment and an opportunity to tap into it through our core tenets of Quality, Reliability and Sustainability.‚ÄùDubai‚Äôs economic future is centred around sustainability, with a clear focus on clean energy, advanced agritech solutions, and smart infrastructure. The UAE has pledged AED 150-200 billion in clean and renewable energy investments by 2030 as part of its net-zero roadmapThe country has also invested approximately $16.8 billion in renewable energy projects across 70 countries and provided over $400 million in aid and soft loans for clean energy initiatives.The combination of supportive business regulations, sustainable building practices, and advanced technological infrastructure creates a conducive environment for the growth of clean-tech and agri-tech sectors in Dubai. Foreign businesses, including Indian entrepreneurs, can leverage these advantages to innovate and expand in the region.The integration of AI in energy management and the enforcement of green building standards not only reduces operational costs but also aligns with global sustainability goals, making Dubai a strategic hub for clean and agricultural technologies.Dubai‚Äôs sustainability initiatives are expected to accelerate further over the next decade. As the UAE progresses toward its Net Zero 2050 goal, government-backed funding, policy frameworks, and global investments in clean tech will continue to rise.‚ÄúFor companies looking at Dubai, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity,‚Äù Gupta concluded. ‚ÄúIf you align with Dubai‚Äôs sustainability vision and establish a meaningful presence here, the growth potential is immense. Dubai isn‚Äôt just investing in a greener future‚Äîit‚Äôs actively building one.‚ÄùDubai‚Äôs pro-business ecosystem and sustainability-driven policies are accelerating growth in the agritech and cleantech sectors, creating new opportunities for entrepreneurs and investors. With tax-free zones, R&D incentives, and streamlined regulations, the city continues to attract innovation-led businesses looking to scale.As trade partnerships expand, particularly with India, and strategic investments in green technology and sustainable infrastructure gain momentum, Dubai is solidifying its position as a global leader in sustainability-driven urban development.Sources:1. https://www.wam.ae/en/article/aq30tt6-uae-pioneers-responsible-and-sustainable-energy?2. https://www.thenationalnews.com/business/energy/2023/12/06/sheikh-mohammed-inaugurates-worlds-largest-concentrated-solar-power-project-in-dubai/3. https://mediaoffice.ae/en/news/2025/february/12-02/saeed-mohammed-al-tayer-highlights-dubai-global-leadership-in-using-ai4. https://www.dm.gov.ae/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Al-Safat-%E2%80%93-Dubai-Green-Building-System-2nd-editionJan2023.pdf5. https://www.weforum.org/stories/2022/05/vertical-farming-future-of-agriculture/6. https://www.wam.ae/en/article/149dop1-dubai%E2%80%99s-production-green-hydrogen-reduces-4507. https://www.wam.ae/en/article/hszrhfof-suhail-mazrouei-reveals-details-updated-uae-energy8. https://decarbonisationnews.com/2024/08/driving-sustainability-forward-blusmarts-strategic-expansion-into-dubais-premium-electric-mobility-market/9. https://www.wam.ae/en/article/hszrhfof-suhail-mazrouei-reveals-details-updated-uae-energy","Dubai is rapidly advancing its sustainability agenda, positioning itself as a global leader in climate-conscious urban development.

Elon Musk's Starlink likely to face spectrum tax,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/elon-musks-starlink-likely-to-face-spectrum-tax/articleshow/119136996.cms,"

NEW DELHI: Starlink is likely to face a spectrum tax in India, which had been abolished for terrestrial network providers, such as Reliance Jio, Airtel and Vodafone Idea a few years back, sources said. The tax, if imposed, will increase service costs for Elon Musk-run satcom venture in India.The move will be another challenge for the American satellite major, which is negotiating stiff compliance mandates related to internet suspension and interception. .Sources told TOI that Starlink, which will be allotted telecom airwaves through administrative allocation (in line with the new Telecom Law passed in Dec 2023), will need to cough up around 3% spectrum usage charge (SUC) on its adjusted gross revenue from the country.""Since spectrum will be 'administratively assigned' to satellite operators instead of auction, SUC will be applicable, for which final rates are being worked upon,"" one of the sources said.This will mean that apart from 8% licence fee, that all telcos need to pay, satcom players will be required to shell out an additional charge for spectrum. ""It may even be higher than 3%, though this is still being discussed.""The matter related to the pricing of satellite spectrum, its tenure and other taxation is currently being finalised by regulator Trai. ""Discussions within Trai are believed to have come to the conclusion that there is a requirement to mandate SUC for satcom players, since they will be allotted spectrum administratively at a pre-determined price,"" the source added.Trai is likely to submit its recommendations on the issue of satcom spectrum allocation soon, and these will then be considered by the department of telecom (DoT). After analysis of the recommendations, DoT may raise further queries on the matter with specific references. Once satisfied, DoT will take up the matter with the inter-ministerial Digital Communications Commission (DCC). After DCC's approval, it will be taken up by the Cabinet.In June 2022, govt had taken a decision to remove SUC for bandwidth that had been auctioned after Sept 15, 2021 across different frequencies.Sources said SUC will also be applicable for other satellite operators, such as Eutelsat One Web (where Airtel promoter Sunil Mittal has a stake) and Reliance Jio-SES (satcom JV between Jio Platforms and Luxembourg-based SES).","The tax, if imposed, will increase service costs for elon musk-run satcom venture in india.
