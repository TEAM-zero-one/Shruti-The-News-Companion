A generous move of Travis Kelce for Kansas City youth sparks debate on social media

Poll What do you admire most about Travis Kelce’s game? His clutch performances His powerful catches

Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce is no stranger to giving back, but his latest act of philanthropy is grabbing headlines for more than just its price tag. The tight end recently donated a $3.3 million home to Foster Love, a nonprofit working to support homeless youth in Kansas City.While many have applauded the move as a heartfelt gesture, the internet has exploded with speculation — with some fans claiming pop sensation Taylor Swift may have quietly financed Kelce's generous donation.The donation comes on the heels of a tough Super Bowl loss, but Travis Kelce’s influence off the field remains as powerful as ever. With a $17.1 million annual contract and an estimated net worth of $90 million, he’s got the financial means to make a serious impact. Still, not everyone is convinced the donation was purely altruistic.The controversy kicked off when fans began questioning the true origin of the funds. Some social media users speculated that Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce’s high-profile girlfriend, may have contributed — or even footed the entire bill. Theories range from Swift subtly backing the donation to the couple strategically making philanthropic moves to boost their public image. “Some fans assume that the singer paid,” read one line in a Marca report, igniting even more online chatter.Still, those close to the athlete say this isn’t out of character for him. Travis Kelce founded the Eighty-Seven & Running foundation in 2015, focusing on underserved youth in both Cleveland and Kansas City. In 2024 alone, he donated 25,000 meals to students in need — a far cry from a one-off publicity stunt.Many are calling the donation a “classy act” and a reflection of Kelce’s long-standing commitment to social good. Others, however, suggest the timing and optics are too calculated. Tax benefits have also entered the conversation, with critics speculating the move could be financially strategic.Also Read: “Bizarre visuals”: Taylor Swift emoji rumors spark chaos as viral tweet dupes iPhone users with fake Apple update Despite the noise, Travis Kelce's track record speaks volumes. His involvement with programs like Operation Breakthrough and direct contributions to education initiatives underscore a history of impact.

Meta confirms: ‘Mark and Priscilla have purchased a home in DC…’

Jeff Bezos, former Google CEO and other tech moguls who have brought houses in Washington

Jeff Bezos purchased a $23 million Kalorama mansion in 2016.

Peter Thiel bought a $13 million beaux-arts residence in 2021.

Similarly, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt acquired a $15 million Georgetown home once occupied by Jacqueline Kennedy.

PayPal co-founder David Sacks, now a White House advisor, purchased a $10.3 million Northwest DC penthouse.

Former eBay executive Jeff Skoll spent $17 million on Virginia properties reportedly planned for a compound.

Mark Zuckerberg has become the latest tech billionaire to establish a presence in Washington DC, purchasing a $23 million mansion in the upscale Woodland Normanstone neighborhood, a report has said. The acquisition, confirmed by Facebook parent company Meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.Politico reports that for weeks, the identity of the buyer remained shrouded in mystery as real estate agents were bound by non-disclosure agreements. Shortly after the cash transaction closed in early March, images of the 15,000-square-foot property became pixelated on Google Maps, the report added.Neighborhood residents noted increased activity at the previously vacant home, coinciding with reports that Zuckerberg’s private jet had landed at Dulles Airport.The publication says that a Meta spokesperson confirmed the purchase, explaining: “Mark and Priscilla have purchased a home in DC, which will allow Mark to spend more time there as Meta continues the work on policy issues related to American technology leadership.”The official explanation cites convenience and safety during increased Washington visits. Notably, Zuckerberg also has properties in Palo Alto, Lake Tahoe and Hawaii, among other places.Although tech titans have acquired Washington properties even before Trump's return to office, the pace has reportedly accelerated significantly in the past year.","The acquisition, confirmed by facebook parent company meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.

Poll Is it ethical for tech companies to collaborate with military organizations? No, it promotes violence. Yes, it's part of national defense.

A former Microsoft employee ignited controversy during the company’s 50th anniversary celebration, confronting top executives including CEO Satya Nadella and former heads Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. The employee, Vaniya Agrawal, an Indian-American software engineer, accused the tech giant of aiding violence in Gaza through its technologies.“Fifty thousand Palestinians in Gaza have been murdered with Microsoft technology. How dare you. Shame on all of you for celebrating on their blood,” she declared before being escorted out of the event. Neither Gates nor Nadella nor Ballmer responded to the outburst, choosing instead to continue their panel discussion.Agrawal, who has since resigned from the company, described Microsoft as a “digital weapons manufacturer” and condemned its alleged collaboration with the Israeli military. In a pointed critique, she called on Microsoft to end its ties with Israel, highlighting what she claimed was a $133 million agreement with Israel’s Ministry of Defense involving AI and Azure tools.In her resignation letter, Agrawal wrote, “I cannot, in good conscience, be part of a company that participates in this violent injustice,” and added, “If you must continue to work at Microsoft, I urge you to use your position, power, and privilege to hold Microsoft accountable to its own values and mission.”This isn’t the first time Microsoft employees have spoken out against the company's partnerships. Earlier, Ibtihal Aboussad, another staffer who also resigned, disrupted a session led by Mustafa Suleyman, Microsoft's AI CEO. She called him a “war profiteer,” accusing him and the company of enabling violence. “Microsoft technologies are being used to commit acts of genocide,” she alleged. Suleyman responded, “Thank you for your protest. I hear you.”Back in February, Nadella faced similar internal dissent when five employees were removed from a meeting after protesting Microsoft’s contracts with Israeli defense entities. The backlash has intensified in recent months as violence surged in Gaza following the breakdown of a ceasefire agreement with Hamas.","Vaniya agrawal, an indian-american software engineer, accused the tech giant of aiding violence in gaza through its technologies.

After depending on high duties for years, how prepared are businesses for a sharp drop in tariffs as govt pushes trade deals?

Your wishlist of reforms...

Union minister Piyush Goyal flagged concerns about Indian startups not doing cutting-edge work...

Sanjay Nayar wears many hats. He is the founder and chairman of Sorin Investments, part of the promoter group of Nykaa and president of industry body Assocham. In an interview with TOI, the former banker, who was also part of the organisers of Startup Mahakumbh, discusses the impact of Trump's tariffs and how govt and business should navigate it. Excerpts:US tariffs will undoubtedly pressure select Indian exporters, especially in sectors like textiles and engineering goods. However, India's economic fundamentals remain solid and domestic demand-led growth offers insulation. Manufacturers will respond by doubling down on supply chain diversification and leveraging FTAs with UAE and Australia to reduce over-dependence on US. ""China+1"" sentiment will continue to work in India's favour, with American buyers now considering India as a reliable alternative sourcing hub. While some near-term order reviews are likely, Indian exporters will start future-proofing through quality upgrades and digital supply chain integration. Overall, the impact is real - about 18% of our merchandise exports are to the US - but India's diversified export base and economic resilience will help cushion the blow. As US producers ramp up their own production capabilities, India must turn its attention to its true competitive edge -namely, the cost-effectiveness of its labour force.Indian businesses will need to adapt to this strategic shift. Govt's aggressive pursuit of FTAs with UK, EU, and other partners will compel Indian firms to enhance competitiveness, without relying on high tariffs. Initiatives such as PLI schemes and GST rationalisation, have already encouraged businesses to modernise operations, improve quality and invest in scale. While some legacy players may feel the pressure, next generation of Indian enterprises appears more agile, price-competitive and aligned with global standards. The shift in trade policy may cause short-term disruption, but it lays the foundation for long-term competitiveness.Executional consistency remains critical, businesses need stable policy frameworks without midstream reversals. Predictability, not surprises, underpins resilience in face of global shocks like US tariffs or FII outflows. Govt must fast-track deep structural reforms. Judicial and contract enforcement reforms need to move from drawing boards to the ground. Delays here stall investments, discourage risk-taking and limit job creation. MSMEs need scaled credit access and institutional backing to participate meaningfully in exports and value chains. The private sector must stop hiding behind comfortable returns on invested capital. There is far too little investment in people, R&D, and capability-building. Tax sops have become a shield, not a catalyst. Indian consumers have little real choice-competition remains limited, innovation subdued. This model is unsustainable.The minister's comments reflect a fair concern - many startups have prioritised scale over innovation. But let's recognise how far the ecosystem has come. India has produced category-defining companies in fintech, logistics, SaaS, and health-tech - often solving problems at population scale. Next wave must go beyond app-based models to deep tech, industrial innovation.","Sanjay nayar is the founder and chairman of sorin investments, part of the promoter group of nykaa and president of industry body assocham.

It has recorded a sharp decline from $23.4 billion in CY2021 to around $9 billion last year (CY2024), data sourced from research firm Venture Intelligence has revealed.The trend continues in the current FY with investments down to nearly $1.2 billion during Jan-March (CY2025) against $2 billion in the corresponding three months period of last year. The data excludes those investments in the real estate sector.Arun Natarajan, founder, Venture Intelligence said, growth stage and late stage deals suffered the most from 'Funding Winter' after peaking in CY2021. ""The recovery in growth stage and late stage funding is expected to be gradual, and led by domestic investors and longer term foreign investors including sovereign wealth firms, Family Offices and traditional PE firms,"" he told TOI. Also, the number of deals in the last stage companies by PE-VC investors is down from 197 in CY2021 to 165 in CY2024, the data said. Late Stage companies are those more than 10 years old or Series G or later rounds of institutional investments.Karan Agarwal, director of PE firm Wilson and Hughes said, the drop in late-stage investments is an indication that the market has fundamentally recalibrated. ""The year 2021 was an anomaly, driven by excess liquidity, record-low interest rates, and aggressive growth bets. Today, capital is more expensive, and investors are no longer funding hypergrowth without clear profitability. The reduction in deal value suggests a shift toward smaller, more structured rounds,"" he said.Pointing out that many late-stage companies raised capital at peak valuations in 2021, he said, investors are hesitant to double down without a clear path to profitability. ""The weak IPO pipeline means exit options are limited, leading PE-VC firms to deploy cautiously. Instead of fuelling aggressive scaling, capital is flowing into companies that can demonstrate strong cash flow and operational efficiency,"" Agarwal added.Navin Honagudi, managing partner at Elev8 Venture Partners said, the trend of selective investments is likely to persist this year. ""While we might see some recovery in certain sectors as macroeconomic conditions stabilize, the focus will remain on sustainability rather than just top-line growth.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New york-based air company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol.

Indian e-commerce firm Udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain and boost vendor partnerships ahead of a stock market debut planned for 2025.The Series E round was done via a combination of fresh equity and conversion of debt, the Bangalore-based company said in a statement Thursday. The round was led by M&G Plc and existing investors including Lightspeed Venture Partners and DST Global participated.The round “fully funds our business plan,” Vaibhav Gupta, Udaan co-founder and chief executive officer, said in the statement. “It enables our continued journey of growth and profitability, positioning us well to be public-market ready in the next 12-18 months.”Udaan, which competes with Reliance Industries Ltd. and Walmart Inc.’s Flipkart in helping smaller merchants source their goods, runs an online marketplace and logistics networks that help mum-and-pop stores get quicker deliveries and cut traditional middlemen out. That kind of digital-led wholesale business, though a very small part of India’s overall retail market, is expected to swell to $150 billion in sales in a decade, according to McKinsey & Co.The startup targets an initial public offering in 2025, though it’s yet to decide whether it will do so in India or overseas, Gupta told Bloomberg News last month.Udaan was founded in 2016 by three engineers who previously worked at Flipkart. The trio together ran the company until Gupta, one of the founders, took over as CEO in 2021. The other two founders — Amod Malviya and Sujeet Kumar — are board members.",Indian e-commerce firm udaan raised $340 million to strengthen its supply chain.
