10 things to know about the Airbus A320 recall



Airbus has ordered immediate repairs for around 6,000 A320-family aircraft, a move that is expected to affect more than half of the global fleet. This large-scale recall may cause widespread disruption, especially in the United States, where it coincides with one of the busiest travel weekends of the year.

Airbus has revealed that a recent incident involving one of its A320-family aircraft has uncovered a potential risk linked to ""intense solar radiation"", which may corrupt data essential for the aircraft's flight-control systems. Following this finding, the company identified a significant number of A320 aircraft currently in service that could be affected by the issue.

Air India has acknowledged the directive, saying it is “aware of a directive from Airbus related to its A320 family aircraft currently in service across airline operators,” and noted that the requirement will involve a “software/hardware realignment” on part of its fleet. The airline has warned that ""longer turnaround times and delays"" are likely during the update process.

Air India recently completed a major retrofit programme for its older A320neo fleet. With 27 refurbished aircraft, 14 newly delivered A320neos, and additional planes added after the Vistara merger, the airline now operates around 104 A320-family aircraft with new or upgraded interiors.

IndiGo has also confirmed compliance with the directive, emphasising that “safety comes first” and stating that it is carrying out the updates “with full diligence and care.” The airline has indicated that some flights may see schedule changes while the work is underway.

Most of IndiGo’s A320 fleet consists of newer variants, with older models now in single digits. With over 350 A320-family planes, the airline is expected to complete updates on nearly 250 aircraft by Monday or Tuesday, according to sources. Air India, with about 120–125 A320s, is expected to finish updates on more than 100 aircraft in a similar timeframe.

Industry observers say this may be one of the largest recalls Airbus has faced in its 55-year history, as Reuters reported. The timing is notable, coming just weeks after the A320 overtook the Boeing 737 as the most-delivered aircraft model in the world.

The repair itself is expected to be relatively simple and mainly involves reverting to a previous software version. Even so, airlines must complete the process before the planes can return to passenger service, except for repositioning flights to repair centres.

Airlines across North America, South America, Europe, India, and New Zealand have warned that the required repairs could lead to delays or cancellations. American Airlines, the largest A320 operator globally, expects to update around 340 of its 480 A320s, with each fix likely taking about two hours.

Other major airlines—such as Lufthansa, IndiGo, and easyJet—are also planning brief groundings for the updates. In South America, Avianca has said more than 70% of its fleet is affected, leading the carrier to temporarily shut ticket sales until December 8 for certain travel dates.

The recall comes at a challenging time for the aviation industry, which is already dealing with heavy workloads at repair shops, long delays for separate engine-related inspections, and labour shortages. These factors are expected to slow down the completion of repairs and add further pressure to global flight operations.

JetBlue incident leads to probe



NEW DELHI: Air travel in India and around the world is expected to face major disruptions after Europe-based Airbus issued a technical directive ordering a software upgrade for its A320 family aircraft. In India, more than 350 IndiGo and Air India A320 planes will remain grounded for the next two to three days while the update is carried out, with normal operations expected to resume by Monday or Tuesday.Globally, around 6,000 aircraft from A320 fleet are likely to be impacted. The grounding is significant because Airbus and its main rival Boeing together control over three-quarters of the world's commercial aircraft fleet, meaning any large-scale recall has an immediate and widespread impact on global air traffic.The technical directive reportedly came shortly after an incident involving a JetBlue A320 aircraft, which led to discussions among safety regulators and eventually contributed to a deeper review of the fleet’s software configuration. While details are still emerging, the episode is believed to have triggered closer scrutiny and may have played a role in Airbus deciding to issue a global advisory and recall order for immediate corrective action.","Airbus has ordered immediate repairs for around 6,000 a320-family aircraft.

Deepfake Shock: Nirmala Sitharaman Reveals Fake Videos Of Herself Online, Warns Of AI’s Dark Side

Armour up with TOI to fight deepening threat of deepfakes





In a world where seeing is no longer believing, India is facing a new digital menace: AI-generated deepfakes.These hyper-realistic videos and audio clips don’t just distort reality. They manipulate public perception, spread misinformation and undermine trust in democracy itself.With 85.5 per cent of Indian households owning at least one smartphone, mobile phones have become India’s bank, classroom and television, making citizens more vulnerable to digital deception.During the 2024 elections, for instance, satirical deepfakes became a campaign tool of sorts. Apart from resurrecting dead leaders, it featured clips such as one that featured PM Narendra Modi dancing the garba with women and Kamal Nath dissing a popular welfare scheme.Though investigations and arrests followed, such videos blur the line between fact and fiction, risking the distortion of voter opinion and the integrity of the democratic process.Cybersecurity experts warn AI is also becoming a key tool in cybercrime: 80 per cent phishing campaigns in 2024 involved AI, with deepfakes exploited for scams.“When you can fake images, audio, and video, how do you know if a real video is real? Suddenly, everything is in question,” said Hany Farid, professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in a TOI interview last year about the worrying rise in AI misuse.The deepfake threat extends beyond politics. Recently, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman highlighted the misuse of AI to clone voices and produce fake videos impersonating her, warning of potential financial scams and the erosion of public trust. “I have seen several deepfake videos of myself being circulated online, manipulated to mislead citizens and distort facts,” Sitharaman said in Mumbai. “Criminals are using AI to mimic voices, clone identities, and create lifelike videos,” she added.Given that over 97% of India’s urban youth aged 15 to 29 owns a smartphone, the impact of such misinformation on a generation is worrying, say observers. “Deepfakes began in 2016. Back then, it was a joke. But the technology has only gotten better. Earlier, there were photoshopped face swaps. Now there are lipsync fakes,” said Prof. Farid, warning that the tech has become more refined, raising the risk of harassment of women through the use of non-consensual sexual imagery.In Nov 2023, actress Rashmika Mandanna became a victim of a viral deepfake video that superimposed her face on to compromising content, sparking widespread outrage. “The very term ‘deepfake’ comes from a Reddit user who in the early days of this technology used it to create porn,” said Farid, calling the new term ‘Generative AI’ clever “rebranding” by the male-dominated tech industry.As AI evolves, India must strengthen legal frameworks, enhance digital literacy, and bring together minds across sectors to ensure safety, say experts. “We need to label everything as real or not real,” said Farid, “We need real disclosures.” To combat the deepening threat of deep fakes, TOI has already started armouring up. Watch out for our ‘Don’t Get Scammed’ stories to stay informed and aware. After all, as Farid puts it, “if you don’t know what’s real, how will you know what’s false”?","Ai-generated videos and audio clips don’t just distort reality.

Explained: Why Vikram-I Could Transform India’s Satellite Launch Market And Global Space Leadership

HYDERABAD/NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Thursday virtually inaugurated Hyderabad-based spacetech startup Skyroot Aerospace’s Infinity campus and unveiled India’s first commercial orbital rocket, Vikram-I, which will launch satellites into low Earth orbit (LEO).Emphasising that India is on track to emerge as a global leader in the satellite launch ecosystem, Modi said, “The private sector is making giant strides in India's space sector. Skyroot's Infinity campus is a reflection of new thinking, innovation and most importantly, youth power. Our youth's innovation, risk-taking ability and entrepreneurship are touching new heights.”Extending his best wishes to Skyroot CEO Pawan Kumar Chandana and company co-founder Naga Bharath Daka, the PM said the two entrepreneurs are an inspiration for young people. “Growth of the private space sector, spearheaded by companies like Skyroot, is also a testament to the govt's efforts to foster innovation and private enterprise in the space domain,” he said.The Infinity facility, spread over 2 lakh sq ft in Hyderabad, will have the capability to design, develop, integrate and test multiple launch vehicles, with a capacity to build one orbital rocket every month. It adds to Skyroot's 55,000-sq-ft integrated rocket design and development facility — Max-Q — near Hyderabad airport.Pointing out that though India’s space journey began with limited resources, its ambitions were never limited, Modi said: “India has proven that the height of dreams is determined not by resources but by resolve. Today, India possesses space sector capabilities that only a few countries in the world have.”He also praised Isro, saying it “has for decades given new wings to India’s space journey.” Modi also recalled the reforms undertaken in the space sector, with his govt opening up the sector to private innovation and preparing a new Space Policy.Modi highlighted that more than 300 space startups are today powering India’s space aspirations, with most of them starting out with small teams. “Gen-Z engineers, designers, coders and scientists are creating new technologies, whether in propulsion systems, composite materials, rocket stages or satellite platforms.”Space promoter and regulator IN-SPACe chairman Dr Pawan Goenka said that in just five years since the space sector was opened up, over 350 space startups have emerged. “The Infinity campus and Vikram-1 are testaments to what can be achieved when entrepreneurial ambition meets enabling policy. We are building more than rockets. We are building a competitive space economy,” he said.Skyroot co-founder Pawan Chandana said the company was ready to launch Vikram-1, fully designed and built in India, in the next two months. Pointing out that decisive space reforms had unlocked the skies for startups to fly, co-founder Naga Bharath Daka said Skyroot has already generated over 1,000 hi-tech jobs and will be investing around Rs 1,000 crore soon to become one of the few companies worldwide to achieve rapid and on-demand launch capabilities.Set up in 2018 by the two IIT alumni and former Isro scientists, Skyroot became the first Indian company to successfully build and launch a rocket into space with suborbital rocket Vikram-S.","Pm narendra modi virtually inaugurated hyderabad-based spacetech startup skyroot aerospace’s infinity campus.

Why the Phillies Would Accept

On-Field Fit and Lineup Impact

Pros, Cons, and Overall Verdict

A blockbuster trade built aroundand thewould instantly become one of the most fascinating storylines of the winter. While not an active or imminent negotiation, the concept makes enough baseball sense that it continues to surface in league speculation. The idea centers on Toronto gaining the middle-order thunder they’ve lacked, while Philadelphia reallocates resources from an aging slugger to a younger, more controllable core.The financial mechanics are a major part of the intrigue. Schwarber is expected to land a contract in the $35-40 million AAV range over four seasons, a level that reflects his near-MVP offensive output and long résumé of postseason impact. Any team acquiring him must weigh both the production and the significant financial weight attached.A clean version of this hypothetical deal sends Schwarber to Toronto - potentially with a bit of cash relief - while Philadelphia receives a versatile, inexpensive bat such as Davis Schneider plus one MLB-ready arm or upper-minors pitching prospect. The Phillies could choose to absorb a slice of Schwarber’s contract to upgrade the talent level coming back, a familiar tactic in trades involving star hitters on nine-figure deals.Toronto’s current roster leans heavily on Vladimir Guerrero Jr. and Anthony Santander for power, with no true left-handed, full-time DH threat. Schwarber solves that instantly. He would slot into the No. 2 or No. 4 spot, surrounding Guerrero with on-base ability and elite home-run production. With seasons of 38 homers in 2024 and a massive 56-homer, 132-RBI campaign in 2025, he becomes their most dangerous slugger since the Bautista-Encarnación era. Toronto also gains a hitter built for October, as Schwarber owns double-digit postseason home runs and deep-run experience with multiple organizations.For Philadelphia, the logic is financial efficiency and roster balance. Committing four years of near-MVP money to a slugger in his mid-30s is risky, especially with existing large contracts on the books. Trading Schwarber gives them payroll room to strengthen pitching and defense while adding long-term value in the form of Schneider and a young arm. The Phillies also have some redundancy in corner power bats and have shown interest in distributing DH at-bats more broadly.Schwarber becomes Toronto’s primary DH, with occasional starts in left field. This reshapes the top six: George Springer, Schwarber, Guerrero Jr., Santander, Daulton Varsho, and Andres Gimenez - a group that forces opposing managers into difficult bullpen decisions due to alternating handedness and multiple 30-plus-homer threats.Toronto gains a game-changing middle-order hammer, improved lineup balance, and proven playoff power. The risks involve Schwarber’s defensive limitations, strikeout rate, and the aging curve tied to a large multiyear contract. Philadelphia, meanwhile, gains payroll flexibility, youth, and positional versatility but loses a fan-favorite slugger and must replace 40–50 homers in the near term.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Mets could acquire $15 million San Diego Padres Starter after Dylan Cease deal In the short run, Toronto likely wins the on-field upgrade. Long-term, Philadelphia can come out ahead if the returned players develop and the payroll space fuels a deeper, more balanced roster.","Kyle schwarber is expected to land a contract in the $35-40 million aav range over four seasons.

What Is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

Disruption will come from the unexpected





Take lessons from the dot-com era









Billionaire investor and Shark Tank judge Mark Cuban has now issued a warning to leading artificial intelligence companies including Perplexity, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft and Meta. Cuban has argued that all these companies are overspending in the race to build the world’s most powerful AI model. As reported by Business Insider, speaking in the Pioneers of AI podcast, Cuban compared today’s AI arms race to the search engine boom of 1990s. The search engine boom ultimately ended with Google dominating the market and leaving all the rivals behind.“You’ve got five, six, whatever it is, companies that are trying to create the ultimate foundational model that we all depend on,” Cuban said. “It’s almost like in the ’90s when all the search engines were competing pre-Google… Now, we know with search engines it’s Google, and then there’s Bing, as, like, 1 or 2% and DuckDuckGo has got a half a percent. So it’s effectively a winner-take-all.”Like many other world leaders and analysts Cuban has also cautioned that the massive investments done on AI could ultimately lead to the creation of a bubble. “They may be overspending,” he said.“And if they overspend or get too caught up, the bubble is in the competition between all those models because that could pop just like that with any new technology.”Along with this, he also raised concerns about the infrastructure costs behind AI, majorly the massive and expensive data centers which are being built to power large models. “I just can’t imagine over a 10-year period that we aren’t going to improve the technology enough that if you overspend on today’s technology, it just doesn’t feel right to me,” Cuban added.Cuban also emphasised that the disruption AI will not come from incremental improvements but from something “incredible” that no one sees coming. “Somebody’s going to come up with some incredible shit, right? If I knew what it was, I’d do it,” he said, suggesting that the current race may be blindsided by a breakthrough outside the existing competition.Cuban said he recognizes the same mix of hype, excitement, and overspending now playing out in AI. “They anticipate for at least another decade spending every penny they have,” he said of the major model developers. “I mean, if that’s not ripe for disruption to come up with better ways, I don’t know what is.”","Billionaire investor and shark tank judge mark cuban has issued a warning to leading artificial intelligence companies including perplexity, openai, anthropic, google, microsoft and meta.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has revealed his annual holiday reading list as the 2025 comes to a close. Gates has recommended five books and he believes that all these titles spark curiosity and reflection during the quieter days of the winter season. “Each of these books pulls back the curtain on how something important really works: how people find purpose later in life, how we should think about climate change, how creative industries evolve, how humans communicate,” wrote Gates.In the blog post, Gates has also explained that holidays are the perfect tome to slow down and also catch up on reading. “There’s something about the quieter days around the holidays that makes it easier to sit down with a good book,” he wrote. His list on 2025 book recommendations reflects on his fascination with how the world works and how you can start a great conversation.The book belongs to the fiction genre and its a story of an aging janitor and a wise octopus captive hime with its empathy and storytelling. “Van Pelt's story made me think about the challenge of filling the days after you stop working—and what communities can do to help older people find purpose,” said Gates.The books explains about the climate challenges. The book structures 50 big questions on climate change, nuclear power and renewables. “ I’ve followed Hannah’s work at Our World in Data for years, and her new book is one of the clearest explanations of the climate challenge I’ve read. She’s realistic about the risks but grounded in data that shows real progress,” said Gates.It is a memoir which recounts the Diller’s extraordinary career in Hollywood, media, and technology, blending personal anecdotes with reflections on power, risk-taking, and the evolution of entertainment and digital industries. “He’s spent his life betting on ideas before they were obvious, and the industries he’s transformed show how much those bets can pay off,” said Gates.The book explains about the mysteries of human behaviour and how people communicate. “Although the topic itself is pretty complicated, the book is readable and practical, and it made me see everyday social interactions in a new light,” added Gate.The books offers a glimpse of at why America seems to struggle to build things and what it will take to fix that. The book argues that progress depends not just on good ideas but on the systems that help ideas spread.",Microsoft co-founder bill gates has revealed his annual holiday reading list as the 2025 comes to a close.

As reported by Business Insider, speaking on the Google AI” Release Notes podcast, Pichai said “I think some folks need some sleep,” adding that hopefully he and his teams “get a bit of rest” now that the milestone launch is behind them.The comment made by Pichai comes as Google is moving towards a $4 trillion market cap as the stock price of the company has surged by nearly 70% this year, including a 12% jump following Gemini 3’s debut on November 18. The Gemini 3.0 model has been widely praised for its reasoning, speed and multimodal capabilities. Recently, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff also described the Gemini 3.0 model as an ‘insane’ leap forward. He also added that after using Gemini 3.0 for two hours he will not go back to ChatGPT.After the successful roll out of Gemini 3.0, Google has managed to reclaim its frontrunner position in the AI race. Pichai noted that years of hard work of the company is the sole reason behind this success.“In 2016, I wanted the whole company to be AI-first,” he said, pointing to milestones such as the creation of Google Brain in 2012, the acquisition of DeepMind in 2014, AlphaGo’s victory in Go, and the unveiling of Google’s own tensor processing units (TPUs), which were used to train Gemini.Pichai further talked about the Google’s strategy. Pichai explained that Google always worked towards a “full-stack” approach to innovation, improving everything from infrastructure to model training and test-time compute. He admitted that when generative AI first gained traction, Google was short on capacity and had to invest heavily to scale. “If you were on the outside, it would look like we were quiet, or we were behind, but we were putting all the building blocks in place, and then executing on top of it,” he said.Recently, Google CEO Sundar Pichai talked about AI layoffs. In a recent expansive interview with BBC, Sundar Pichai pushed back against concerns that AI could eventually lead to mass job cuts. Pichai said that the tech will eliminate some jobs but also “evolve and transition” others -- ramifications that mean ""people will need to adapt.""Pichai further added that AI may be gunning for his job, but he doesn’t seem too worried about it. AI is advancing so swiftly, he said, that over the next 12 months the tech will be able to perform “complex” tasks and act as an agent on a users' behalf. ""That’s where it gets really interesting,"" he said.",Google recently launched its most-advanced ai model — gemini 3.0. Google ceo sundar pichai has acknowledged that his engineers are overdue for a break. The comment comes as google is moving towards a $4 trillion market cap as the stock price has surged by nearly 70% this year.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125604688,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-496675,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

"Ekman, who linked facial expressions to emotions, dies at 91",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/ekman-who-linked-facial-expressions-to-emotions-dies-at-91/articleshow/125649854.cms,"



Paul Ekman, a psychologist who linked thousands of facial expressions to the emotions they often subconsciously conveyed, and who used his research to advise FBI interrogators and screeners for the Transportation Security Administration as well as Hollywood animators, died Nov 17 at his home in San Francisco. He was 91.Ekman sought to add scientific exactitude to the human impulse to interpret how others feel through their facial expressions. He recorded 18 types of smiles, for example, distinguishing between a forced smile and a spontaneous one; a genuine smile, he discovered, crinkles the orbicularis oculi muscle - that is, it creates crow's feet around the eyes.Sometimes described as the world's most famous face reader, Ekman was influential in reshaping the way facial expressions were understood - as the product of evolution rather than environment - and his findings crossed over to popular culture.As a young researcher in the late 1960s, Ekman changed the scientific consensus on facial expressions. In the postwar era, the conventional wisdom of eminent anthropologists like Margaret Mead was that human facial expressions were learned and that they varied across cultures. Ekman believed otherwise. He showed photographs of people making faces expressing 30 different emotions - including anger, joy and fear - to subjects in the United States, Japan and South America.Across cultures, the study's participants linked the expressions they were shown with the same emotions.He then travelled to Papua New Guinea with a colleague, Wallace V Friesen, and showed the same pictures to some 300 Indigenous people who had no exposure to modern media and could not have learned to interpret faces that way. These subjects also connected the expressions to the same emotions.""There is a pan-cultural element in facial expressions of emotion,"" Ekman wrote in a paper in 1970 on returning to the United States.","Paul ekman, a psychologist who linked thousands of facial expressions to the emotions they often subconsciously conveyed, died nov 17 at his home in san francisco.

'Zero Americans are named Raja Krishnamoorthi'





Indian-origin Democratic Congressman (Illinois) Raja Krishnamoorthi was criticized for reintroducing an Act that he proposed earlier to increase the number of H-1B visas available each year. The move was called 'vicious' and 'tone-deaf' on social media as the administration is dealing with a major H-1B controversy after President Donald Trump said America needs certain talents but MAGA doesn't agree.The High-Skilled Immigration Reform for Employment (HIRE) Act proposes to increase the number of available H-1B visas from 65,000 to 130,000. The proposal says this would ensure US employers, including those in critical and emerging technology sectors, can recruit the specialized talent needed to fill persistent workforce shortages.To shield itself from criticism, the bill also directs new funding to strengthen STEM programs in US schools.“To build the jobs and industries of tomorrow, America must stay at the forefront of innovation by strengthening our own workforce while continuing to welcome top talent from around the globe,” Krishnamoorthi said. “The HIRE Act advances both goals by boosting STEM education in our elementary and secondary schools and by expanding the annual supply of H-1B visas from 65,000 to 130,000.By growing our domestic talent pipeline and ensuring employers can recruit the skilled workers they need, we can create good-paying jobs and secure America’s leadership in the technologies of the future. ”Social media users called for Krishnamoorthi's deportation as they claimed that he should not be in Congress if he is serving India. ""Zero Americans are named Raja Krishnamoorthi. Deport that man,"" one wrote. Another called him 'Raja Krishnamoorthi of New Delhi'. Social media users also reacted as to why he was so interested in H-1B as there are no large tech companies in Illinois.Krishnamoorthi's bill is supported by ITServe Alliance, the nation’s largest association of IT services firms. “The HIRE Act is an important step toward modernizing our high-skilled immigration system and ensuring that talented professionals can continue to contribute to America’s innovation economy,"" governing board chair of ITServe Alliance Raghu Chittimalla said",Indian-origin democratic congressman (illinois) raja krishnamoorthi was criticized for reintroducing an act that he proposed earlier to increase the number of h-1b visas available each year.

What is TM Marketplace?

How does the UAE platform work?

Secure Transactions: All buying and selling activities require users to log in for identity verification, and financial transactions are completed seamlessly using secure digital payment systems.

Verified Assets Only: To protect investors, only national and international trademarks officially registered in the UAE can be listed on the platform.

Regulatory Oversight: The Ministry of Economy provides direct supervision, guaranteeing full compliance with both national and international IP laws, including the foundational Federal Decree-Law No. 36 of 2021 on Trademarks.

Lowering Market Barriers: For entrepreneurs and international investors, the platform provides access to ready-made or promising brands, drastically cutting the time and risk typically involved in starting a business from scratch in the UAE market.

No download, no subscription





The UAE’s Ministry of Economy & Tourism has unveiled TM Market Place, the Middle East’s first dedicated digital platform for listing, buying and trading registered trademarks. The platform aims to turn intangible brand assets into more liquid, tradable items, boost trademark registrations and attract global brands to the UAE market.TM Market Place provides a central online venue where owners of trademarks registered in the UAE can list their marks for sale or license, and where buyers and investors can discover, evaluate and acquire brand assets. The platform was developed under the UAE Government Leaders Programme and intends to make trademark transactions faster, more transparent and easier to manage, bringing a new commercial use for intellectual property in the region.The platform was carefully developed through a strategic collaboration between the MoET and the UAE Government Leaders Programme, ensuring it meets the highest international standards for security and transparency. It acts as a trusted digital bridge seamlessly connecting sellers with a wide, diverse base of local and international investors worldwide.Here’s how the process is streamlined:For those eager to jump into the world of brand trading, accessing the TM Market Place is intentionally simple and user-friendly.The Ministry of Economy and Tourism (MoET) established the platform as a secure online digital portal, meaning there is no mobile application to download from an app store.Users can access the marketplace directly through the MoET's web services and must log in to ensure identity verification and transaction security.Crucially, there is no subscription fee required to browse, list, or access the marketplace. The platform operates as a government-overseen exchange. Any costs incurred are directly related to the transaction itself: the agreed-upon purchase price of the trademark (paid to the seller) and the subsequent official government fee for the mandatory legal process of re-registering the brand's ownership in the buyer's name.This free-to-access model removes financial hurdles for new investors and keeps the focus solely on the value of the intellectual property being traded.","Uae launches platform to buy and sell trademarks easily.
