NEW DELHI: French aerospace major Dassault Aviation has tied up with Tata Advanced Systems Limited (TASL) to manufacture fuselage of Rafale fighters at Hyderabad, as part of the overall Rs 63,887 crore (almost ₹7 billion) deal inked by India in April to acquire 26 maritime variants of the omni-role jets.The inter-governmental deal, under which the 26 Rafale-M jets will be delivered in the 2028-2030 timeframe, had included the setting up of a production facility for fuselages as well as MRO facilities for aircraft engines, sensors and weapons in India.With the IAF first inducting 36 Rafales for Rs 59,000 crore and then the 26 Rafale-M jets for the Navy, the French fighter is the frontrunner in the long-pending project to manufacture 114 multi-role fighter aircraft with foreign collaboration in India, which was initially estimated to cost Rs 1.25 lakh crore and is now being fast-tracked, as reported by TOI earlier.Under the four production transfer agreements between Dassault Aviation and TASL, the Hyderabad facility will manufacture ""key structural sections"" of the Rafale, including the lateral shells of the rear fuselage, the complete rear section, the central fuselage, and the front section for India and global markets.""The first fuselage sections are expected to roll out in FY 2028, with the facility expected to deliver up to two complete fuselages per month,"" a joint Dassault-TASL statement said on Thursday.""For the first time, Rafale fuselages will be produced outside France. This is a decisive step in strengthening our supply chain in India. Thanks to the expansion of our local partners, including TASL, this supply chain will contribute to the successful ramp-up of the Rafale and, with our support, will meet our quality and competitiveness requirements,"" Dassault chairman Eric Trappier said.TASL CEO Sukaran Singh, in turn, said, ""This partnership marks a significant step in India's aerospace journey. It also reflects the remarkable progress India has made in establishing a modern, robust aerospace manufacturing ecosystem that can support global platforms.""

'Time for a war on pollution’: Delhi’s EV and dust control push takes shape at Urban Adda 2025,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/time-for-a-war-on-pollution-delhis-ev-and-dust-control-push-takes-shape-at-urban-adda-2025/articleshow/121655265.cms,"NEW DELHI: Urban Adda 2025 wrapped up on World Environment Day after three days of discussion, policy announcements, and public engagement focused on clean mobility, gender equity, and sustainable urban design. Organised by the Raahgiri Foundation in partnership with the International Council on Clean Transportation (ICCT) and GuruJal, and supported by Nagarro, the event brought together over 600 participants across 30 sessions at the India Habitat Centre.Union Minister Mansukh Mandaviya, inaugurating the summit on World Bicycle Day, reflected on his personal use of cycling for commuting and called for a cultural shift: “Cycling is the best form of exercise and the solution to pollution. Let’s shed the idea that it’s only for a certain class. It must become a national movement.”The first day saw Delhi Transport Minister Dr. Pankaj Kumar Singh announce the upcoming launch of Delhi’s EV Policy 2.0, which aims to address last-mile safety, eliminate bus shortages, and improve transport governance. “It’s not just about how many buses, but whether people feel safe in them,” he said.The second day spotlighted gender and urban mobility, with actor and entrepreneur Pooja Bedi saying, “Our commute isn’t travel, it’s survival.A medal is reaching home without trauma.” Her remarks called attention to the daily challenges faced by women in public transport.Rajasthan minister Rajyavardhan Rathore spoke about the success of rural electrification in his state, while discussions on electric vehicle localisation warned against blindly replicating internal combustion engine models. “EV localisation must follow demand, not dictate it,” said Neha Jain of JSW MG Motors.The final day focused on climate resilience and public transport governance. ICCT and IIT Roorkee released a comprehensive review of EV emissions. CAQM Chairperson Rajesh Verma warned of unchecked vehicle growth: “Vehicles have increased 21 times since 1981—but roads have barely doubled.”Amitabh Kant, India’s G20 Sherpa, cited the economic and health toll of pollution in Delhi and called for immediate reforms, including electrification of two- and three-wheelers and adoption of solar-powered technologies in small industries. “Delhi loses Rs 100,000 crore and 6.3 years of life expectancy annually to pollution. It’s time for a war against it,” he said.The event concluded with the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding between CAQM and the Raahgiri Foundation to develop a Resources Lab for dust pollution mitigation in NCR cities.","Urban adda 2025 wrapped up on world environment day after three days of discussion, policy announcements, and public engagement.

World Environment Day 2025: 7 ways to reduce your carbon footprint when buying beauty products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/beauty/world-environment-day-7-ways-to-reduce-your-carbon-footprint-when-buying-beauty-products/articleshow/121635970.cms,"The beauty industry's environmental impact is significant, but consumers can make planet-friendly choices. Opt for products with natural ingredients and certifications, support local brands to reduce transportation emissions, and minimize single-use packaging by choosing refillable or package-free options. Embrace multi-tasking and waterless products, research brand ethics, and practice mindful consumption to promote a more sustainable beauty routine.

Read the labels like a pro



Buy local, support small



Say no to single-use packaging



Multi-tasking products are eco superstars



Go waterless where you can



Check the brand’s sustainability ethics



#World Environment DayPlant trees, throw garbage in dustbins, discard plastics, and prefer walking: Celebs take steps to preserve the environment

Use less, finish more



Beauty that’s more than skin deep



Beauty may be skin deep, but its impact on the planet goes far beyond that. From plastic-heavy packaging to harmful production processes and long transportation chains, the beauty industry leaves a sizeable carbon footprint. As conscious consumers, we have the power to shift the narrative and make planet-friendly choices without compromising on our skincare or glam routines.On this World Environment Day, here’s how you can reduce your carbon footprint while shopping for beauty products:The journey to sustainable beauty begins with mindful ingredient choices. Harsh chemicals like parabens, phthalates, sulphates, and microbeads aren’t just harmful to your skin in the long run, they also damage ecosystems when they wash down the drain. Instead, opt for products with naturally derived, biodegradable ingredients that won’t pollute waterways.Look for third-party certifications. These aren't just buzzwords, they indicate that the product has met certain environmental standards in both formulation and production.When it comes to reducing your carbon footprint, the shorter the supply chain, the better. International beauty products may be tempting, but they often rack up air miles that contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.Consider supporting local or regional brands that source and manufacture within your country. These often use locally available botanicals, reducing the energy needed for transportation.Bonus: buying local supports artisans, small businesses, and often results in fresher formulations.If your beauty routine includes dozens of plastic tubes, jars, and droppers, it’s time for a rethink. The beauty industry produces over 120 billion units of packaging every year, most of which ends up in landfills or oceans.To reduce your impact:Opt for refillable products whenever possible (think lipsticks, deodorants, perfumes).Choose brands that use glass, aluminium, or PCR (post-consumer recycled) plastic.Go package-free with solid shampoos, conditioners, and soaps.Support companies offering recycling return schemes.Do you really need a separate cream for your neck, face, and eyes? Often, the answer is no. Multi-use products reduce packaging waste, manufacturing resources, and shipping energy.Look for:Lip & cheek tintsBB creams with SPFAll-in-one serums (hydration + antioxidant + brightening)Cleansers that double as makeup removersNot only will your bathroom shelf thank you, but your travel bag will too.Water is a precious resource, and yet many skincare and haircare products are made up of up to 90% water. The extraction, treatment, and transportation of water adds to environmental strain. Waterless beauty is an emerging trend that helps mitigate this.Try products like:Powder-to-foam cleansersSolid shampoos and conditionersOil-based serums and moisturisersSheet mask alternatives like reusable cloth masksBy choosing waterless formats, you also get longer shelf lives and concentrated formulas that require less packaging.A brand’s marketing might be green, but what about their backend practices? Look beyond the product itself and research:Is the brand carbon-neutral or carbon-negative?Do they use renewable energy in production?Are their workers paid fair wages?Do they offset emissions through tree planting or verified carbon credits?Many ethical brands are transparent about their sustainability reports and list them on their websites. Supporting them means contributing to a cleaner, more equitable planet.It’s tempting to hoard makeup or jump on every new skincare trend, but overconsumption is one of the biggest environmental culprits. Instead of a “more is more” approach, shift your mindset to “quality over quantity.”Wait till you finish a product before buying another.Use the correct quantity to make your products last longer.Share products with a sibling or roommate to reduce wastage.Donate unopened, unused items to verified beauty banks.Minimalism isn’t just aesthetic, it’s sustainable.As beauty consumers, we don’t need to overhaul our entire routine overnight. But small, consistent changes can compound into a major impact. Choosing a refillable lipstick, supporting a local brand, or switching to solid shampoo are all steps that reduce emissions, conserve resources, and push the industry toward greener practices.","The beauty industry's environmental impact is significant, but consumers can make planet-friendly choices.

Every year, millions of Muslims from across the globe journey to the holy cities of Mecca and Medina to perform Hajj — one of the five pillars of Islam and the most significant spiritual undertaking in a Muslim’s life. This year, the Hajj pilgrimage is not only a religious journey of devotion and reflection but also a remarkable feat of digital transformation and technological innovation. For 2025, Saudi Arabia has introduced a host of cutting-edge upgrades to ensure pilgrims can perform their rituals with ease, safety, and seamless connectivity. From the provision of free, high-speed internet to the deployment of AI-powered crowd monitoring systems and climate-controlled mosque environments, the Kingdom is leveraging advanced technology to modernize the pilgrimage experience at an unprecedented scale.This effort reflects the Kingdom’s broader Vision 2030 goals, which include transforming Saudi Arabia into a global hub for innovation while preserving its deep-rooted religious and cultural heritage. According to the Gulf News report, with over 10,500 WiFi hotspots, full 4G and 5G coverage, AI-driven safety systems, and even the world’s largest mosque cooling infrastructure, Hajj 2025 may be the most technologically advanced pilgrimage in Islamic history.One of the most talked-about innovations this year is the provision of free, high-speed internet access for all Hajj pilgrims. Saudi Arabia has installed more than 10,500 WiFi access points throughout the pilgrimage zones, including Mecca, Medina, Mina, Arafat, and Muzdalifah. This vast network eliminates the need for pilgrims to seek connectivity during their rituals or logistical movements.According to Saad Al Shanbari, spokesperson for the Hajj Communications and Technology System, the initiative aims to enhance both the spiritual and logistical journey of the pilgrims, as per the Gulf News report. “There’s no need to search for WiFi,” he stated. “Internet access is now available for all pilgrims, everywhere.”This connectivity not only allows pilgrims to stay in touch with family back home and access religious resources but also provides real-time updates, maps, and official communications directly from Hajj authorities.In tandem with the WiFi rollout, the Communications, Space and Technology Commission (CST) has achieved 100% 4G and 5G network coverage across all major Hajj sites. This includes high-density areas such as:This move ensures high bandwidth and low latency for millions of simultaneous users, accommodating massive data transfers, real-time video calls, and even live religious broadcasts to families and followers around the world.Saudi authorities report that over 4,000 telecom engineers and technical staff have been deployed to maintain and optimize service during peak Hajj days.Crowd management during Hajj is critical, given that millions of pilgrims converge in confined spaces, especially during peak rituals like the Day of Arafat or the symbolic stoning at Jamarat. For 2025, Saudi Arabia has introduced an AI-powered crowd control and safety monitoring system developed in collaboration with Aramco Digital.This system integrates:The AI monitors crowd flow in real time, identifies bottlenecks or high-density zones, and alerts authorities instantly to deploy crowd control personnel or reroute groups to avoid stampedes or accidents.Al Shanbari emphasized the real-time responsiveness of the system, saying, “We’ve deployed smart surveillance systems to manage crowd flows through AI-based monitoring and secure communications. The safety of pilgrims is our highest priority.”Another groundbreaking innovation is the world’s largest cooling system installed at the Grand Mosque in Mecca. As Hajj 2025 coincides with the peak of summer in Saudi Arabia, temperatures are expected to soar above 45°C (113°F). To combat this, the Kingdom has enhanced its centralized air conditioning infrastructure, using underground pipelines to pump chilled air across prayer halls and corridors.The cooling system comprises:This is a critical move for public health and comfort, especially for elderly and physically vulnerable pilgrims. Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Hajj and Umrah confirmed that this upgrade has already helped prevent numerous cases of heatstroke and dehydration during the initial phases of Hajj 2025.As part of the smart Hajj initiative, Saudi Arabia has also digitized its emergency response operations. Hospitals and medical tents near pilgrimage sites are now AI-integrated and GPS-synced, enabling faster triaging, emergency routing, and real-time coordination between ambulances and medical teams.An example of the system’s success emerged recently when an Egyptian pilgrim survived a heart attack and received immediate treatment thanks to the system's real-time alert and GPS tracking. He is now recovering and is expected to resume his pilgrimage after medical clearance.To tie everything together, Saudi Arabia has launched the Hajj Smart App, an all-in-one platform offering:This app is GPS-enabled and linked to the broader smart infrastructure, allowing pilgrims to navigate easily, even in dense crowds or unfamiliar areas.","For 2025, saudi arabia has introduced a host of cutting-edge upgrades to ensure pilgrims can perform their rituals with ease, safety, and seamless connectivity.

iOS 26 expected updates

Apple will kick off its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on Monday, June 9 at 1 PM ET (10:30pm IST), where it is expected to unveil its biggest operating system redesign since iOS 7, along with sweeping UI changes and updated names across its operating system platforms. According to rumours, the company may change the name system of operating systems. Instead of version number, operating systems will now be named by year. It means the update after the current iOS 18 will be iOS 26 rather than, say, iOS 19. Similar naming system may be introduced for other OS platforms as well.While artificial intelligence is expected to play a smaller role compared to recent tech industry trends, Apple is aiming to deliver long-requested improvements such as better window management for iPads and deeper personalization features. According to a 9to5Mac report, the company is working on practical updates to everyday apps such as Messages, Music, Notes, and CarPlay, offering a mix of AI-powered tools and design upgrades.Among the standout additions expected on the Messages app in iOS 26 is automatic message translation, powered by Apple Intelligence. This feature will allow real-time translation of incoming and outgoing texts, improving communication across different languages—similar to features already seen in apps like Google Meet.In Apple Music, the Lock Screen Now Playing view is rumoured to get an upgrade. The full-screen album art may feature an animated artwork, making for a more immersive experience directly on the Lock Screen—a small but polished touch that builds on recent UI improvements.As per the report, Apple Notes will also gain the ability to export notes in Markdown, a long-awaited feature for users who frequently move between Apple’s native app and third-party platforms.The 9to5Mac report states that the design refresh coming with iOS 26 will extend to CarPlay, bringing it in line with the broader Apple ecosystem’s updated visual language. Although the full scope of changes is unclear, it says that both regular and “Ultra” versions of CarPlay will receive visual updates.","Apple will kick off its worldwide developers conference (wwdc) on monday, june 9.

Top stocks to buy or sell today: Stock recommendation for June 6,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/top-stocks-to-buy-or-sell-today-stock-recommendation-for-june-6/articleshow/121663851.cms,"J P Morgan has an overweight rating on Reliance Industries with a price target of Rs 1,568. Analysts feel that RIL’s Earnings in the next two years should be better than the last two. They said that RIL’s stock price has felt the pressure of large earnings cuts driven by weaker commodity EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes). This should not recur (given the already low margins). Consumer business growth should translate better to bottom-line, helping relative performance.Motilal Oswal Financial services has downgraded Bharti Hexacom to neutral with the target price at Rs 1,900 as analysts feel the risk-reward for the stock is no longer attractive. They said that since they started their coverage of the stock in Mar ch 2-25, the stock has delivered 40%+ returns. Given that Bharti Hexacom provides a pure-play exposure to Bharti's fast-growing India wireless and homes business with slightly higher growth prospects, better RoCE (return on capital employed) and lower capital misallocation concerns, they had argued for a slight premium to its parent, Bharti Airtel.However, analysts now believe a premium of about 40% is steep and risk-reward is no longer attractive.Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating on Vishal Megamart with a price target of Rs 161. Analysts said that the management believes the company can continue the current pace of store expansion in the medium term. The company has come a long way from close to bankruptcy to emerging as a successful aspirational (value) retailer.Incred Equities has maintained its add rating on TCS but with a reduced target price of Rs 3,589 from Rs 3,925 earlier. Analysts said that TCS shows better operating cash flow, dividend payout ratio certainty, and healthy return ratios, all of which support valuation while a slower recovery in North America and the FSI vertical, weak bookings, and higher project cancellations are downside risks.Elara Securities India has an accumulate rating on KEC International with the target price at Rs 1,020. Analysts said their rating is based on a robust order pipeline from domestic as well as international markets, scope for margin improvement, reduction of debt, potential for value unlocking through demerger of the cables business, and recovery of stuck cash from both civil and rail projects. With robust momentum in power T&D, real estate and infra, KEC Intl remains a preferred player in the EPC space with a prominent international presence to further boost visibility, they said.","J p morgan has an overweight rating on reliance industries with a price target of rs 1,568.

Seasoned players like Kenneth Gainwell and Cordarrelle Patterson add versatility on passing downs and special teams.The receiving corps is led by star acquisition DK Metcalf, a dynamic deep threat who perfectly complements Rodgers’ strong arm. Veteran Robert Woods brings route-running savvy and reliable hands, while speedy slot receiver Calvin Austin III offers big-play potential. Alongside them, young talents like Roman Wilson, Brandon Johnson, and rookies Montana Lemonious-Craig and Roc Taylor form a versatile group capable of stretching defenses both vertically and horizontally.At tight end, Pat Freiermuth remains a key target with his dependable hands and solid blocking. He is supported by Darnell Washington, whose size and athleticism make him a red-zone weapon, and rookie JJ Galbreath, adding depth and developmental promise.

However, the segment's rapid growth is exposing structural cracks in pricing, workforce stability, and profitability, a report by consulting firm Kearney said.The report, published on Thursday, showed that while quick commerce expanded beyond impulse buys to staples like rice, atta, and edible oil, most of the demand is not new. Nearly 93% of sales come at the expense of modern trade, e-commerce, and kirana outlets. Just 6-8% is incremental.Meanwhile, platform discounts average 6-9%, lower than e-commerce and modern trade players, which offer 13-18% off. Once delivery and handling fees are factored in, quick commerce becomes price-competitive only when compared to kiranas.Despite its popularity in top metros and tier-2 cities, adoption remains uneven across product categories. While snacks, cold beverages, and gifting items saw strong traction, categories like fruits, vegetables, electronics, and personal care continue to see low migration, with consumers preferring in-store purchases or wider selections available on other channels.Quick commerce's most significant impact is in employment generation, but with trade-offs. It creates about 62-64 jobs per Rs 1 crore of monthly gross merchandise value, on par with general trade and higher than ecommerce (25-29) or modern trade (41-42). However, over 70% of these roles are last-mile delivery jobs, typically filled by gig workers with limited job security.

The post remains vacant, leaving the sector without regulatory leadership at a time when several major initiatives are awaiting rollout.The most ambitious among them is Bima Sugam, a unified digital marketplace for policy comparison, purchase, and servicing. With each insurer having invested a few crore in the platform, its launch plan is yet to be finalised. Bima Vistaar, aimed at rural bundled coverage, and Bima Vahaak, a women-led distribution model, are also facing technical and operational delays.Moves to shift to a risk-based capital framework and align insurance accounting with IFRS remain incomplete. These efforts, meant to modernise regulatory oversight and financial disclosures, have not progressed due to a lack of industry readiness and clarity on implementation.Proposals to allow 100% FDI, issue composite licences, and introduce differentiated capital norms have yet to be legislated. Plans to list state-run insurers have also not advanced amid resistance from within the public sector.At the same time, regulatory scrutiny of mis-selling and poor distribution practices has increased.RBI and the finance ministry have flagged concerns over banks and auto dealers forcing customers to buy bundled insurance. Regulatory audits have revealed issues such as opaque claim rejections, sharp premium hikes, and poor portability in retail health insurance.""If the insurance industry is to grow the way mutual funds did after 2010, we need greater transparency, lower costs, and rebuilt trust,"" said Kamesh Goyal, co-founder of Go Digit General Insurance. ""Sebi introduced direct plans and standard charges. Insurance could adopt similar guidelines-such as mandating refunds with interest when loss ratios fall below a certain level.""Goyal added that small retail customers are often subsidising large corporate groups. ""We're not saying distributors shouldn't earn, but loss ratios at 10% are unsustainable. A level of 60-65% is more realistic, accounting for costs and investment income. Once a fair value proposition is in place, mis-selling naturally comes down,"" he said. Public sector insurers are also under pressure, with three of them breaching solvency norms. While insurance premiums have increased, the number of individual policies has remained flat, limiting its impact on financial inclusion.Another area needing regulatory attention is surety bonds. Though these now substitute bank guarantees, insurers say they carry higher risk due to a lack of protection under bankruptcy laws-unlike banks. The delay in appointing a new chairman has slowed reform at a time when the sector needs urgent regulatory clarity.","The most ambitious among them is bima sugam, a unified digital marketplace for policy comparison, purchase, and servicing.
