Bengaluru “Water Bears”

He may have witnessed more than a hundred sunrises and sunsets from orbit, but for Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla , the first eight days aboard the International Space Station (ISS) have been a whirlwind of scientific discovery.While six of the seven Isro-led experiments are underway, tardigrades or “water bears” that travelled all the way from Bengaluru to the orbital lab some 400 km from Earth, have served their purpose in space.Shux, who kicked off his scientific experiments with Myogenesis — to investigate the biological pathways behind skeletal muscle degradation in microgravity inside the Life Sciences Glovebox, marked his first week in orbit by completing the study on tardigrades or “water bears”.“Shukla has successfully completed the microgravity experiment involving Tardigrades onboard the ISS,” Isro confirmed. The next step would be for the principal investigators to analyse the data obtained from experiments conducted by Shux.The study focused on tardigrades’ survival, revival, and reproductive behaviour in space. It will provide valuable insights into the underlying biological mechanisms leading to resilience of extremophile organisms in microgravity environments and has potential applications on Earth especially in the area of therapeutics,” Isro confirmed.The water bears at ISS were studied in the Voyager Tardigrades experiment designed by researchers from the Indian Institute of Science (IISc).Biochemist Sandeep Eswarappa and team at IISc, who spent over five years studying tardigrades, resilient microscopic organisms that have survived five mass extinctions, discovered a Paramacrobiotus species with an astonishing defence: When exposed to lethal ultraviolet radiation, this species absorbs the harmful rays and emits harmless blue fluorescence instead.That was the first direct experimental evidence of photoprotective fluorescence in any organism. And, it is this ‘Bengaluru strain’ of the tardigrade that has flown to the ISS with Shux.Shux’s first eight days in orbit as part of the Axiom-4 (Ax-4) mission have been defined not just by spectacle, but also a series of intricate biological investigations that could transform both future space missions and life on Earth.The Myogenesis study, on the other hand, is progressing with planned interventions and recording of observations as per the experiment protocol. In parallel, other Indian experiments for studying selected strains of microalgae and cyanobacteria under space conditions are ongoing, contributing to research on regenerative life support systems and crew nutrition.“As part of the Electronic Displays human research study, Shux carried out daily software-based cognitive and interface assessments. The study aims to optimise crew interaction with digital systems in the unique environment of space,” Isro added.A day before the well-deserved “rest day” upon completing half his stay at the ISS, he had begun documenting the progress of the Cyanobacteria Growth Experiment, another Isro-led study analysing how photosynthetic bacteria behave in space. These tiny organisms could one day form the backbone of life support systems on long-duration missions, recycling carbon dioxide into oxygen and aiding water regeneration.Shux also helped deploy and manage samples for the Space Microalgae investigation — another study with enormous potential. Microalgae, already valued on Earth for their rapid growth and nutritional content, are being cultivated in orbit to observe how microgravity influences their metabolism, genetic activity, and biomass yield. These hardy organisms may serve as future spacefarers’ food, fuel, or even pharmaceutical source.",Astronaut shubhanshu shukla completed study on tardigrades or “water bears’ the study will provide valuable insights into the underlying biological mechanisms leading to resilience of extremophile organisms in microgravity.

‘Tesla gave me a future’: Ex-employee on how the company transformed his life

Ex-Tesla employee quits due to Musk’s politics

An emotional exit after 7 years



Respect for the company, not the leadership

After seven years of working at Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada, former engineering technician Trae Cervantes has made the difficult decision to step away from the company, citing moral discomfort with CEO Elon Musk ’s recent actions. Cervantes, who began his career as a production associate in 2018, steadily advanced to an engineering technician role before formally resigning in March 2025. His departure was not spurred by workplace conditions or job dissatisfaction, but rather by a growing unease over Musk’s political involvement and public conduct.In an interview with Business Insider, Cervantes reflected on both the opportunities and challenges he experienced at Tesla. He joined the company during the high-demand ramp-up of the Model 3 production line and described his early days as physically taxing but professionally rewarding.“I started out on their production line for the Model 3 and I moved up from there,” Cervantes said. “When I started out, it was gruelling work. It was pushing heavy things up and down aisles. I was on my feet for 12 hours a day, but they also give you three to four days off a week to recover.”Tesla supported Cervantes' growth over the years, offering him access to professional development programs, including certifications in advanced manufacturing and Lean Six Sigma through local college partnerships.Cervantes credits Tesla with helping him build a career despite having no formal education or technical training before joining the company.“I was getting paid the most I'd ever gotten in my adult life,” he said. “No education, no real skills to speak of, and Tesla offered me opportunities to take charge of my life and grow my career.”He highlighted how the work culture at Tesla—particularly among peers and supervisors—was largely positive and focused on efficiency, learning, and advancement.“I stayed because they kept treating me well. I didn’t have a reason to leave for a long time,” Cervantes noted.However, Cervantes' sentiment toward the company began to shift as Musk became more active politically and made several high-profile public moves, including acquiring Twitter and engaging in voter-related controversies.“What I took issue with the most was the giveaway for prospective voters,” he said, referring to a public campaign Musk promoted. “It seemed so morally wrong. I didn't want to be associated with that.”The turning point for Cervantes came when Musk's public image, behaviour, and political commentary became more prominent in association with Tesla’s identity.“Last year, I started to be ashamed to tell people where I work,” he admitted.While Cervantes did not go into detail about every incident that caused concern, he made it clear that the cumulative effect of Musk’s public actions led him to feel ethically conflicted about remaining with the company.Cervantes decided to leave Tesla without securing another job. He described his final conversation with his supervisor as emotional and honest.“I have to leave. I can't do this anymore. It's getting to a point where I feel like I'm compromising myself morally by walking through those doors every day,” he recalled telling his manager.The decision was not taken lightly. “I’m not going to lie, I cried a little. Seven years is a long time, and Tesla wasn’t always a bad thing for me,” Cervantes shared.While Cervantes walked away from his position at Tesla, he was careful to clarify that his issue was not with the company’s workforce or its mission, but with its leadership.“There are plenty of good people at Tesla. I didn’t leave the place because of the company. I left because of the face of the company,” he stated, referring directly to Elon Musk.","Trae cervantes worked as an engineering technician at tesla's gigafactory in nevada for seven years.

Romantic getaway to a French castle makes headlines before social media shake-up

It seems Cardi B ’s whirlwind romance with New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs might be hitting a rocky patch — at least online. Barely a month after confirming their relationship through a series of intimate Instagram posts, fans were quick to notice that the Grammy-winning rapper has now scrubbed her page of all traces of Diggs.In early June, Cardi B had made her love public, posting affectionate clips of the couple and even joining Stefon Diggs at his fourth annual ""Diggs Day Camp"" at the University of Maryland. However, her sudden Instagram purge has sparked speculation that trouble may be brewing behind the scenes. Diggs, on the other hand, still has photos of Cardi up on his profile, adding further mystery to the sudden social media move.The timing of the Instagram deletion is curious, especially after reports that Diggs recently pulled out all the stops for a luxurious romantic retreat with Cardi. According to The Cut, the four-time Pro Bowl wide receiver rented the Château de Farcheville — a lavish medieval castle just outside Paris — for their private escape. The $12,000-per-night venue features everything from a music room to a wine cellar and spa, making it a fairytale getaway for the high-profile pair.The couple’s romance had been gradually going public since they were first linked back in October 2024. They were spotted celebrating Valentine’s Day together, and again at Madison Square Garden for the NBA Playoffs on May 25. But it wasn’t until Cardi B’s June Instagram posts that fans got official confirmation.While his offseason escapades have grabbed headlines, Stefon Diggs will soon need to turn his attention to football. After signing a $69 million, three-year deal with the Patriots in March, all eyes are on his upcoming partnership with rookie quarterback Drake Maye. Training camp opens July 23, and with expectations high, Diggs’ performance will be crucial in shaping the team’s 2025 season.Also Read: Tom Brady’s surprise wedding date isn’t a new flame—and Gisele Bündchen gives her full approval As for his relationship with Cardi B, it's still unclear whether the Instagram wipe signals a breakup or just a pause on public sharing.

Microsoft’s middle management is the target in its second largest ever round of layoffs



Microsoft laid off approximately 9,000 employees Wednesday, marking the company's second major workforce reduction this year. The cuts, affecting less than 4% of Microsoft's global workforce, hit the Xbox gaming division particularly hard, with several high-profile game cancellations and studio closures announced alongside the layoffs.The job cuts span multiple teams across geographies and tenure levels as Microsoft seeks to streamline operations and reduce management layers. The company cited ""organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace"" as the primary driver for the workforce reduction.The layoffs eliminated hundreds of positions across Microsoft's gaming subsidiaries, including King (makers of Candy Crush), ZeniMax, Raven Software, Sledgehammer Games, Halo Studios, and Turn 10 Studios. Microsoft also shuttered The Initiative studio and canceled the highly anticipated Perfect Dark reboot and fantasy game Everwild after years of development.Microsoft's Stockholm-based King division is cutting 10% of its workforce, eliminating approximately 200 positions. The Initiative, a premium Xbox studio established to develop AAA exclusives, will close entirely following the Perfect Dark cancellation . Rare Studio's Everwild, in development for several years, was also terminated alongside ZeniMax Online Studios' unannounced project.""To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business,"" Xbox CEO Phil Spencer told employees in an internal memo. The gaming division employed about 20,000 people as of January 2024.The latest cuts represent Microsoft's fourth mass layoff in the gaming division within 18 months, following the company's $69 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition in October 2023. Microsoft previously eliminated 6,000 positions in May, targeting product and engineering roles, plus an additional 300 workers in June.The company cited the need to ""remove layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness"" while redirecting resources toward artificial intelligence development. Microsoft's AI-related expenses reached approximately $80 billion in the last fiscal year as it competes in the generative AI market.“We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,” the spokesperson said.Affected employees will receive severance packages including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources, with priority consideration for other positions within Microsoft's broader organization.","Microsoft laid off approximately 9,000 employees wednesday, marking the company's second major workforce reduction this year.

Whether one likes it or not, America was built by immigrants, the wretched masses that the Statue of Liberty inscription asks to welcome with open arms. From Albert Einstein to Elon Musk, immigrants made America a great country, and now it looks like they are making America great again (MAGA, as the slogan goes), and this time in artificial intelligence. America’s edge isn’t just its innovation, it's the global brainpower who has been giving an edge to the country for centuries. And nothing makes that clearer than the news out of Meta’s new Superintelligence Lab: 11 top AI researchers hired, and every single one of them is an immigrant.That’s right, not one US undergrad among them. These are elite engineers, model architects, and machine learning pioneers who began their academic journeys in India, China, South Africa, the UK, and Australia. They trained in America’s best labs, built some of the most advanced AI systems at OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic, and now they’ve been snapped up by Zuckerberg to build the next wave of intelligence. If you want to understand why the US leads the world in AI, you don’t need to look at GPUs or model benchmarks. Just look at the passports of the people writing the code.Immigrants have long been the silent engine of Silicon Valley. From coding at Google to architecting cloud infrastructure at Microsoft, they form the backbone of America’s biggest tech empires. A significant number of these engineers hail from India, whose talent pipeline has become essential to the innovation output of the U.S. tech sector. They don’t just fill jobs, they define the direction of the industry. Now, as AI becomes the next great technological frontier, these same minds are shaping the models, algorithms, and safety protocols that will govern its future.

Intel CEO Lip Bu Tan may be planning this 'big change' in company's chip manufacturing business,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-ceo-lip-bu-tan-may-be-planning-this-big-change-in-companys-chip-manufacturing-business/articleshow/122214957.cms,"Why Intel’s new CEO may not be ‘happy’ with chipmaking process promoted by ex-chief



Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is reportedly planning a ‘big change’ to the company's chip manufacturing business to attract major customers. This potential shift deviates from his predecessor's plans and could involve substantial investment. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, two sources familiar with the matter revealed that this new strategy for Intel's foundry business would involve offering outside customers a newer generation of technology. Analysts also reportedly believe that this next-generation chipmaking process would position Intel more competitively against Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) in securing large clients like Apple or Nvidia.After taking over as the company’s new CEO in March, Tan has been reassessing the company's investment in its 18A chip manufacturing process, which was promoted by former CEO Pat Gelsinger .The Reuters report cited sources to claim that Tan has expressed concerns that 18A is not attracting enough external clients and may result in a major financial write-off if Intel stops marketing it to new customers. Intel has already spent billions on developing 18A and its variant, 18A-P.While Intel continues using 18A for in-house chips and select commitments to companies like Amazon and Microsoft , Tan may be shifting focus to the 14A process, the Reuters report claims.Intel believes 14A could offer a stronger competitive position against Taiwan-based rival TSMC, whose N2 and N3 technologies are already in production or close to it, the report adds.As per the Reuters report, Tan is expected to present strategic options to Intel’s board, potentially by this month. However, a final decision may not come until later in the year due to the high stakes involved.Meanwhile, Intel continues restructuring under Tan’s leadership, with steps including new engineering hires and streamlined management. Last year, Intel posted a net loss of $18.8 billion, which was its first unprofitable year since 1986, as it works to regain ground lost in past tech transitions.","Intel ceo lip-bu tan is reportedly planning a ‘big change’ to the company's chip manufacturing business to attract major customers.

Could the electric hydrofoil ferry change the way we commute?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/could-the-electric-hydrofoil-ferry-change-the-way-we-commute/articleshow/122259280.cms,"



During the golden age for ferries in the 1800s, steamboats dotted the shorelines of coastal cities to transport passengers. Then cars and trains took over. Now, driven by congestion and the revitalisation of urban waterfronts, ferries are making a comeback. But, what operators struggle to offer is a fast, sustainable mode of transit. ""Commuters want speed,"" said Jakob Kuttenkeuler, a professor of naval architecture at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.Over the last few months, however, Stockholm has been testing a vessel that may solve that problem: the world's first electric hydrofoil ferry.Developed by a Swedish start-up, Candela, a 30-seat, battery-driven vessel known as the P-12 has almost halved the commute time of a conventional diesel ferry - to 30 minutes - across an 11-mile stretch between the island of Ekero and City Hall in the centre of Stockholm. At the same time, the P-12 emits 95% less emissions than the diesel ferry and uses 80% less energy, according to SL, the Stockholm public transport authority.Gustav Hasselskog, Candela's founder and chief executive, said the realisation, 11 years ago, that his speedboat guzzled 15 times as much fuel as his car had set him on a course to develop an energy-efficient maritime solution. ""High-speed passenger ferries and boats are the least fuel-efficient mode of transit in the world because almost all energy is used to push away the water,"" he said.""If you convert to electric, you need massive amounts of batteries, which are expensive and have limited range. The only way to go far and fast on the same battery is when you hydrofoil."" Hydrofoils are the winglike structures mounted under a boat's hull to lift the craft above the water as it gains speed, much as airplane wings do through the air. The technique drastically reduces drag from water friction and allows for faster, more energy-efficient travel.Kuttenkeuler, who invented the Efoil, an electric hydrofoil board that glides above the water's surface, said hydrofoil technology was a common marine transport system in the 1980s but was phased out because of the high operational costs. Advancements in digitalization, composite materials and sensor technology have contributed to its comeback, he added.In addition to the environmental benefits, the electric hydrofoil has several other advantages. The batteries are relatively small, so they do not require massive charging infrastructure. They do not generate waves that erode the shoreline or wreak havoc for windsurfers and moored boats in their wake. And because they are kept level by a computer and soar over the waves, they do not cause seasickness.So far, Mumbai, India, has the most ambitious plans for the P-12. JalVimana, the local shuttle operator, will begin with 11 ferries on popular tourist routes from the Gateway of India to Alibag and Elephanta Island. A third route will connect the airport with the centre of Mumbai, cutting travel time from 90 minutes by car to less than 30 minutes on the water.","Swedish start-up candela has developed the world's first electric hydrofoil ferry.

FIX : The Viral Pistachio Kunafa Chocolate



L'ocali: Luxury Meets Heritage



Bateel: The Pioneer of Date Chocolate



Al Nassma: The Camel Milk Chocolate Pioneer



Samha: Camel Milk with a Twist



I Love Dubai: A Fusion of Local Flavors







Dubai’s airports have become a chocolate lover’s paradise, with a remarkable 2.5 million bars of locally made chocolates sold in just the first half of 2025. This surge in sales, which has generated an impressive Dh165 million in revenue, underscores the increasing demand for UAE-based chocolate brands. Speaking to local media outlet Dubai Eye, Ramesh Cidambi, CEO of Dubai Duty Free, highlighted that these sales have provided a significant boost to the local economy. Cidambi pointed out that, since these brands are homegrown, the majority of the revenue from these chocolate sales remains within the UAE, benefitting the country’s economy as a whole.FIX has become synonymous with ""Dubai chocolates,"" particularly due to its world-famous pistachio kunafa chocolate. This unique fusion of traditional Middle Eastern dessert flavors with chocolate took the world by storm. Despite various attempts by other brands to replicate it, the authentic FIX taste remains an exclusive treat found only in the UAE.In an exclusive collaboration with Dubai's Crown Prince Sheikh Hamdan, FIX crafted a one-of-a-kind chocolate flavor, tailored to his personal preferences, which included Halawt, a traditional Middle Eastern dessert.The brand has continued to innovate, recently launching a tropical flavor, ""Time to Mango,"" which aims to capture the essence of Dubai’s sunny climate.The Dubai-born brand L'ocali blends two key pillars of the UAE, heritage and luxury. Its chocolates, which include dates wrapped in 24k edible gold, embody the opulence that Dubai is famous for. L'ocali’s offerings also include chocolate-coated dates with various fillings such as pistachio, rose, and orange peel, as well as gourmet chocolates crafted from Belgian truffles and Swiss chocolate.The brand’s focus is on capturing the essence of Dubai’s luxury experience, making it a favorite among both locals and tourists.Bateel is more than just a chocolate brand, it’s a part of the UAE’s culinary heritage. Established in 1992, the brand is deeply rooted in both the UAE and Saudi Arabian traditions, with its headquarters in Dubai. The word ""Bateel"" refers to the young offshoot of a date palm tree, symbolizing growth and new beginnings, which aligns with the brand’s commitment to innovation in chocolate.Bateel revolutionized the chocolate industry when it ""invented the date chocolate"" in 2000, combining the rich flavors of dates with the decadence of high-quality chocolate. Beyond its signature date chocolates, Bateel also offers artisanal chocolates from regions like Brazil and the Dominican Republic, along with cookies inspired by Middle Eastern flavors like date dhibs and milk chocolate sesame praline.The brand’s expansion into the broader food sector, with the opening of Cafe Bateel in 2007, cemented its position as a beloved spot for residents and visitors alike. In 2023, it launched Bateel El’an, a more compact, cafe-focused format.Founded in 2008 by Dubai Ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Al Nassma is the UAE's first camel milk chocolate brand, and it has become an iconic name in the Middle East. Camel milk has long been a staple in the region, particularly among Bedouins, and Al Nassma uses this unique ingredient to craft chocolates that reflect the traditions of the Arabian desert.The brand has made a mark with its ""hollow figures,"" caravan boxes, pralines, and chocolate bars. Known for its luxurious offerings, Al Nassma has positioned itself as the ""Godiva of the Middle East,"" combining high-quality chocolate with the distinct flavor of camel milk.Launched in 2019 by Prime Chocolate, the parent company of Al Nassma, Samha brings another dimension to the world of camel milk chocolate. While Al Nassma offers a broad range of camel milk-based chocolates, Samha focuses specifically on camel milk-covered dates, which are a local favorite.Samha has also embraced the pistachio kunafa flavor, adding a camel milk twist that brings a unique local touch. The bite-sized treats are a popular choice for birthdays, gatherings, and celebrations, helping people from diverse nationalities in the UAE share a taste of local culture.If you thought pistachio kunafa chocolate was the most innovative combination, think again. ""I Love Dubai"" offers some of the most unique chocolates in the region, including pistachio baklava chocolate and gahwa crunch. The pistachio baklava is a nod to the UAE’s rich history of layered desserts, while the gahwa crunch incorporates gahwa, the Emirati term for Arabic coffee, a symbol of the country’s legendary hospitality.Another standout is halwa rahash, a Middle Eastern dessert made from sesame seed paste. It has a nutty, fudge-like texture, and when paired with chocolate, it creates a truly distinctive local flavor experience.","Dubai duty free saw a surge in chocolate sales, with 2.5 million bars sold in the first half of 2025.

Renovating the world’s largest fountain: The hidden work behind Dubai’s iconic water show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/renovating-the-worlds-largest-fountain-the-hidden-work-behind-dubais-iconic-water-show/articleshow/122257332.cms,"The Dubai Fountain’s renovation upgrades its flooring, technology, and maintenance systems, with engineers and workers operating 24/7 across its 18-football-field-sized pool/ Image: Instagram

A Fountain Like No Other: The Scale of the Task



The Ongoing Renovation : A Major Overhaul



New Flooring System: The old concrete surface had occasional cracks, disrupting maintenance. Now, a durable waterproofing system is being installed, including a special primer and insulation designed to help with water retention.

Glowing Blue Tiles: These tiles, visible beneath the water from all angles around the lake, are not just visually striking but also functional, adding to the overall aesthetic and longevity of the structure.

Robotic Technology : A Fountain Powered by Machines



Choreography Bots: These robots control the movement of the water jets, ensuring they spray in perfect rhythm with the music.

Lighting Bots: These robots adjust the lighting, ensuring that the visual effects are perfectly in sync with the water's movements.

Fixed Water Jets: These jets spray water in harmony with the beats, adding another layer of coordination to the show.

Keeping Everything Clean: The Underwater Maintenance



A Temporary Pause, but the Show Goes On







The Dubai Fountain is known for its captivating performances, synchronized water jets, dazzling lights, and perfectly timed music. As the world’s largest choreographed fountain, it draws millions of visitors each year to the heart of Downtown Dubai. But what does it really take to maintain and renovate this iconic spectacle? From intricate underwater technology to the massive team of engineers and robots working tirelessly, the work behind maintaining and renovating the Dubai Fountain never stops. It goes on around the clock, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, ensuring this iconic water show continues to dazzle visitors long into the future. Here’s a closer look at the monumental effort behind the scenes.The Dubai Fountain isn’t just big; it’s enormous. The fountain stretches over an area as large as 18 football fields. Beneath its shimmering surface lies a sophisticated network of water jets, robotic arms, and lighting systems, all working in perfect harmony to create the mesmerizing shows that have made it famous.Given its sheer size, it's no surprise that keeping the fountain in top shape requires a lot of work. In fact, hundreds of engineers and technicians are involved in maintaining the fountain, handling everything from daily upkeep to major renovations.In April 2025, the fountain was temporarily shut down for a five-month renovation to improve its performance, aesthetics, and longevity. The project, confirmed by the fountain’s developer Emaar, involves an array of upgrades. Though the renovation has taken the fountain offline, the work behind it will ensure that the Dubai Fountain continues to dazzle for years to come.Key improvements include:These changes aren't just about making the fountain look better, they aim to ensure that the fountain runs smoothly and efficiently for years to come.One of the most fascinating aspects of the Dubai Fountain is the extensive use of robotic technology. From choreography bots that control the movement of water to lighting bots that match visual effects with the rhythm of the music, these robots play a crucial role in every performance. In fact, the programming of a single song for the fountain can take several weeks, as multiple robotic systems must be synchronized to create the perfect dance of water and light.The renovation also involves upgrading the technology behind these systems to improve precision and reduce the time it takes to program a new performance. As a result, the fountain will continue to deliver unforgettable shows, with even better choreography and lighting.Beneath the water's surface, maintenance is just as crucial. The fountain's 1.3-meter-deep lake houses the powerful jets and robots, which means it requires constant attention to stay pristine.To keep the fountain looking its best, underwater robots are deployed regularly. These machines clean the lakebed and ensure the water remains at the highest quality. The newly installed soft flooring makes cleaning even quicker and more efficient, allowing for easier maintenance. Water quality checks are conducted regularly, with samples taken from various parts of the lake to ensure the water stays fresh and clear.While the fountain is temporarily out of action, Emaar has ensured that visitors still get a taste of its magic. The construction area has been cleverly integrated with digital display screens that play archival footage of the fountain’s past performances, in sync with the light shows from the Burj Khalifa. So even though the live fountain shows are paused, the spirit of the Dubai Fountain is still alive, giving visitors a preview of the wonder to come.The renovation is scheduled to wrap up by October 2025, just in time for the cooler months. When the fountain is back in action, it will not only look better but also function more smoothly, thanks to the impressive behind-the-scenes work currently underway.","The dubai fountain’s renovation upgrades its flooring, technology, and maintenance systems, with engineers and workers operating 24/7 across its 18-football-field-sized pool.

Trent: Key AGM Updates

Trent Ltd, a Tata Group company, saw a significant share price decline of 8.7% to Rs 5,652 on the National Stock Exchange on Friday. This drop followed the company's AGM announcement regarding slower revenue growth, leading Nuvama brokerage to revise its rating to 'hold' and reduce the target price from Rs 6,627 to Rs 5,884.During its AGM, Trent revealed anticipated revenue growth of approximately 20% for Q1FY26, indicating a substantial reduction from its previous performance, according to an ET report. This forecast represents a considerable decrease from the 35% CAGR achieved during FY20-FY25, falling below the company's targeted 25% CAGR for future periods.Nuvama expressed its concerns about the potential slowdown, stating: ""At its AGM, Trent disappointed on near-term growth expectations in its core fashion business, which is expected to deliver ~20% growth in Q1FY26E, sharply down from its five-year CAGR of 35% (FY20–25). Management reaffirmed their aspiration of 25%-plus growth for the coming few years, but the current run rate falls short of it.""Following this development, Nuvama adjusted its projections downward, reducing FY26 and FY27 revenue forecasts by 5% and 6% respectively. Additionally, EBITDA estimates saw reductions of 9% and 12%.The brokerage's decision to adopt a more conservative investment position stemmed from the observed growth moderation, necessitating a reassessment of both Trent's earnings outlook and valuation.While downgrading its rating, Nuvama recognised Trent's enduring aspirations and implementation success, specifically highlighting its reaffirmed goal of achieving a tenfold revenue increase in the upcoming years—a strategic objective initially presented in FY23. During the AGM, the leadership team reported that revenue had already doubled since announcing this target.""This growth will be backed by robust additions of ~250 stores across formats as per management guidance, whose tone has historically been conservative. Accordingly, we remain confident of management beating this given the execution track record,"" Nuvama said.The financial services firm identified Zudio Beauty and Star Bazaar as key revenue generators for future expansion, whilst noting that both ventures require operational stability before undertaking significant growth initiatives.Star Bazaar outlook: Trent Hypermarket (Star Bazaar) has the potential to grow larger than Westside and Zudio, primarily due to the substantial size of India's food retail sector.Independent operations: Star Bazaar will maintain its focus on Trent's branded products, without plans to integrate with Big Basket, which is viewed as a higher-priced alternative.Growth targets: Management confirmed their FY23 target of achieving 10x revenue growth, highlighting that revenue has already increased twofold since the announcement.Retail expansion plans: The organisation plans to establish over 250 new stores across various formats in FY26, with flexibility to increase this number based on market dynamics and real estate availability.Trent's share price has increased by approximately 70% in 2025, reflecting positive investor sentiment towards its growth strategy. However, Nuvama has expressed concerns about the sustainability of these high valuations, noting indications of declining momentum, according to the ET report.""Underwhelming near-term growth prompts the downgrade to 'HOLD' as the current valuation is too demanding. A significant jump in growth profile, or pickup in other levers i.e. Star Bazaar, Zudio Beauty remain the key risks to our view,"" the brokerage concluded.The company disclosed its Q1 business performance update on Friday morning, post market opening.For the April–June quarter of FY26, Trent's standalone revenue from product sales (including GST) reached Rs 5,061 crore, showing a 20% increase from Rs 4,228 crore in the corresponding period of the previous year, aligning with their projected guidance.As at June 30, 2025, Trent's retail presence comprised 248 Westside stores, 766 Zudio stores (with two locations in the UAE), and 29 stores representing various other lifestyle concepts.(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own.

"Engineers must now think like CEOs, OpenAI’s Srinivas Narayanan at IIT-M alumni event",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/engineers-must-now-think-like-ceos-openais-srinivas-narayanan-at-iit-m-alumni-event/articleshow/122269974.cms,".

BENGALURU: In the age of artificial intelligence, software engineers must evolve into decision-makers with CEO-like vision, said OpenAI’s VP of Engineering Srinivas Narayanan, speaking at the IIT Madras Alumni Association’s Sangam 2025 conference on Saturday.“The job is shifting from just writing code to asking the right questions and defining the ‘what’ and ‘why’ of a problem. AI can already handle much of the ‘how,’” Narayanan said, urging developers to focus on purpose and ambition over executional detail.Joining him on stage, Microsoft’s Chief Product Officer Aparna Chennapragada warned that simply retrofitting AI onto legacy tools won’t be enough. “AI isn’t a feature you can just add on. We need to start building with an AI-first mindset,” she said, pointing to how natural language interfaces are replacing traditional UX layers.The panel, moderated by IITMAA President and Unimity CEO Shyamala Rajaram, explored AI’s impact on jobs, product design, safety, and education. Chennapragada said the future belongs to those who combine deep expertise with generalist flexibility. “Prompt sets are the new PRDs,” she quipped, referring to how product teams now work closely with models to prototype faster and smarter.Narayanan shared that OpenAI’s models are already being used in medical diagnostics, citing a case where a reasoning model identified rare genetic disorders at a Berkeley-linked research lab. “The potential of AI as a collaborator, even in research, is enormous,” he said.On risks, Narayanan acknowledged challenges such as misinformation, unsafe outputs, and misuse. He noted that OpenAI recently rolled back a model for exhibiting “psychopathic” traits during testing, highlighting the company’s iterative deployment philosophy.Both speakers stressed accessibility and scale. While Chennapragada called for broader “CS + AI” fluency, Narayanan said model costs have dropped 100-fold over two years. “We want to democratise intelligence,” he said.Chennapragada closed with a thought: “In a world where intelligence is no longer the gatekeeper, the real differentiators will be ambition and agency.”","Software engineers must evolve into decision-makers with ceo-like vision, said openai’s vp of engineering srinivas narayanan. “the job is shifting from just writing code to asking the right questions and defining the ‘what’ and ‘why’ of a problem,’” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122270332,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1170844,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
IIT Madras to launch Rs 200 crore VC fund,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/iit-madras-to-launch-rs-200-crore-vc-fund/articleshow/122270310.cms,"BENGALURU: IIT Madras is setting up a Rs 200 crore venture capital fund to invest in startups emerging from the institution, Director Prof V. Kamakoti announced at the annual alumni gathering Sangam 2025 on Saturday. The fund, titled the IITM Alumni Fund, will mark a first-of-its-kind initiative in India’s academic landscape, directly linking alumni capital with institute-affiliated entrepreneurship.“All of you can invest,” Prof. Kamakoti told the alumni audience. “This is your opportunity to work with great startups and technologies, and to grow along with your alma mater.”The fund aims to support early-stage companies founded by IIT Madras students, faculty, and alumni, and will invite contributions from the global IITM alumni network. Kamakoti cited the Tamil phrase, loosely translated as “giving returns to the giver,” to underline the dual value proposition of impact and returns.While operational details are yet to be formally released, the fund’s vision is bold: By 2032, Kamakoti wants to see one IPO per month from the IITM startup ecosystem. “If IIT Madras can’t do it, I don’t think India can,” he said.Speaking at the event, another faculty member added that this initiative is likely the first such VC fund by an Indian academic institution aimed exclusively at nurturing its startup ecosystem.“We hope this will give rise to dozens of Tarun Mehtas,” they said, referring to the Ather Energy cofounder and IITM alumnus.The announcement comes at a time when IIT Madras has emerged as one of the country’s most prolific academic incubators, credited with spawning deeptech ventures across electric mobility, AI, and space tech. The fund is expected to institutionalise that pipeline and scale it with alumni-backed capital.","Iit madras is setting up a rs 200 crore venture capital fund to invest in startups emerging from the institution.
