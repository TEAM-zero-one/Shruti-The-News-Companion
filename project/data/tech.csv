"E20 ethanol-blended petrol hits vehicle mileage, users bear brunt",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/e20-ethanol-blended-petrol-hits-vehicle-mileage-users-bear-brunt/articleshow/123621956.cms,"E27 Fuel Explained: What 27% Ethanol In Petrol Means For Your Car, Mileage & Wallet

NEW DELHI: The admissions by the automobile industry and the govt that ethanol-blended petrol (E20) can cause a drop in a vehicle’s mileage in the range of 2%-6% is a double whammy for consumers as they keep paying higher price for fuel but their vehicles run less.Take the example of Surender Pal Singh, a Delhi-based automobile engineer, who claimed the mileage of his less than three-year-old car reduced significantly in the last 4-6 months. “The average mileage of my car was around 17-17.5 km on Delhi roads when I bought it. The mileage slipped to 16.5 km last year and I thought it may be because of my driving habits and traffic conditions. But 4-5 months back I saw the mileage touching 14.5 km,” Singh claimed, who was the principal of a major vehicle driving institute. Singh claimed that recently, he switched to “premium fuel”, which is about Rs 7 costlier, and the fuel mileage has improved, adding that he himself drives his car.Several car users have posted such observations and complaints on social media, raising questions why they should keep paying the price for a fuel that gives them less mileage.Govt think tank Niti Aayog in its 2021 report on ‘Roadmap For Ethanol Blending in India 2020-25’ had recommended that “for better acceptability of higher ethanol blends in the country, retail price of such fuels should be lower than normal petrol to compensate for the reduction in calorific value and incentivise switching to the blended fuel.Tax breaks on ethanol as a fuel may be considered by the govt”.The report had highlighted that while using E20 fuel, there would be a drop in fuel efficiency by nearly 6%-7% for four-wheelers and 3%-4% for two-wheelers designed for E0 (100% petrol) and calibrated for E10, and 1%-2% for four-wheelers designed for E10 and calibrated for E20. “However, with the modifications in engines (hardware and tuning), loss in efficiency due to blended fuel can be reduced,” the report mentioned.Automotive Research Association of India (ARAI), citing two studies of 2016 and 2021, said that in testing it found E20 not to have any adverse impact on vehicles.",The automobile industry and the govt have admitted that ethanol-blended petrol (e20) can cause a drop in a vehicle’s mileage in the range of 2%-6%.

Why Swifties saw the repost as crossing a personal boundary

A history of oversharing from the Kelce family



Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s engagement was supposed to be a fairytale celebration, but a surprising move by Travis’ mother, Donna Kelce, has stirred controversy. Swifties are expressing outrage after Donna reposted a comedy reel that joked about Taylor’s “uterus aching” to “breed” a Kelce baby—a post that many fans labeled invasive and “weird AF. ”The reel originally came from comedian Leanne Morgan, who joked on stage: “Her uterus is aching, and she wants a baby. She wants a baby, and it’s time. It’s time for her to want a baby and she wants to breed with that big old Kelsey boy.” While the bit may have been intended as humor, Donna’s decision to share it amplified the message in a way that Swift’s loyal fanbase didn’t appreciate.Many argued that Taylor, fresh off a major engagement, should not have to endure pressure about starting a family. Swifties flooded social media, describing Donna’s repost as not only inappropriate but also reflective of the “stereotypical MIL” trope—placing expectations on a woman’s personal choices instead of simply celebrating her joy.This isn’t the first time a Kelce parent has drawn attention for saying too much. Travis’ father, Ed Kelce, previously raised eyebrows when he shared behind-the-scenes details of the engagement, including that Taylor had grown “antsy” about the timing.While some fans found it sweet, others felt it was far too personal for public consumption.Also Read: “Hottest female”: Ciara's ex-boyfriend calls her his hottest ex contrasting his past with her life now with NFL star Russell Wilson Still, Donna has also shown genuine affection toward Taylor, even changing her Facebook cover photo to a collage of baby Travis and baby Taylor after the engagement. Their warm public moments at NFL games suggest there is a bond—yet Swifties are urging the Kelces to give Taylor space to define her future on her own terms.","Taylor swift and travis kelce’s engagement was supposed to be a fairytale celebration.

Massive social media backlash



'Yes, I took it' : Polish CEO's reported response







Millionaire CEO Piotr Szczerek was unmasked on social media after his video of snatching a hat from a child at US Open went viral. The hat was special as it was signed by tennis star Kamil Majchrzak's and the CEO had no reason to snatch it from the child other than the pure intent of bullying a child. His enthusiasm for the hat signed by Kamil that left a child heartbroken backfired as social media users hunted down the CEO, his business and his family and vowed that he will have to pay a bitter price for what he did on camera.Piotr Szczerek is a Polish entrepreneur and the CEO of a paving and landscaping company called Drogbruk, which he co-founded with his wife Anna in 1999.During a live broadcast at the 2025 US Open, Polish tennis star Kamil Majchrzak tried to hand his signed cap to a young fan, but Piotr Szczerek grabbed it first and tucked it into his wife’s bag—snatching it away from the disappointed boy. The moment instantly went viral and sparked widespread outrage. Online sleuths identified Szczerek as the man in the clip, and backlash followed rapidly. Following the incident, Szczerek deactivated his social media accounts amid the public fury. Critics even debated his actions online, calling him “selfish” and demanding accountability. In the wake of the controversy, Polish fans and users on platforms like Gowork.pl flooded Drogbruk’s online space with harsh criticism and negative reviews.Kamil Majchrzak responded to the row and tracked down the child, Brok, and gifted him a new signed cap and other memorabilia.Social media users said Szczerek's company will now pay a massive price for what he did. ""Nothing is more disgusting than a child bully. He is Piotr Szczerek, the owner of the Polish Drogbruk company, stealing the cap of Kamil Majchrzak during the US open.

Phil Perry’s words echo the Patriots’ fragile climb

Vrabel’s urgency puts Maye under brighter spotlight

Playmakers need to shine or Maye carries the weight

The New England Patriots enter 2025 with renewed hope around Drake Maye, but optimism is colliding with realism. NFL insider Phil Perry believes the offensive line will be “100% better” than last year, yet he added a blunt assessment—it may only reach “close to average. ” That single line captures the fine balance between progress and persistent concern as head coach Mike Vrabel raises expectations for his young quarterback.Perry’s verdict slices through preseason enthusiasm. “They have the potential to be 100% better. … But that doesn’t mean they’re suddenly solid across the board. … I think they can get close to average,” he explained. For a franchise long defined by excellence, the idea of celebrating “average” signals just how steep the climb remains.The second-year quarterback impressed as a rookie with 2,276 passing yards and 15 touchdowns, but Vrabel wants sharper execution. Gone are the training wheels of Year One; Maye must now elevate his play behind an offensive line still seeking stability. Pressure on nearly 40% of dropbacks last season exposed how fragile the protection has been, leaving Maye often scrambling to survive.Even with Stefon Diggs headlining the receiving corps, Perry put the odds of a breakout 1,200-yard season at under 8%. That uncertainty places a heavier burden on Maye’s improvisation and Vrabel’s scheme adjustments. Unless the line delivers consistency and playmakers step up, “close to average” could define the offense again.At its core, Perry’s quote is more than analysis—it’s a warning. For Maye and the Patriots, the road to true competitiveness will demand far more than just being average.Also read: Chicago Bears fifth-round rookie Zah Frazier will sit out 2025 season after personal issue emerges",The new england patriots enter 2025 with renewed hope around quarterback drake maye.

Estimated net worth of Carlos Santana reflects years of consistent earnings

Blending leadership with experience, and financial payoff

Carlos Santana is a 39-year-old veteran first baseman recently designated by the Cleveland Guardians who is in talks to join the Chicago Cubs and awaits a late-career encore, as per The New York Post’s Jon Heyman. Despite all the on-field distractions, though, his net worth, closer to the upper end of $106–120 million range, is a reflection of the long success of his career, spanning nearly his whole life both in and out of Major League Baseball.As of mid-2025, Santana had earned around $120 million during his past 16 seasons. The majority of his wealth is attributed to lucrative contracts, pitching bonuses, and endorsements, according to several reputable websites. On the other hand, a salary tracker estimates Santana's annual salary in 2025 at $6.725 million and his net worth at approximately $106.7 million. While the precise amount varies by outlet, both estimates highlight the monetary benefits of a career characterized by versatility, plate discipline, and, above all, resilience.The bulk of Santana's net worth comes from his career earnings. Santana has been signed to one-year contracts, including the $12 million one he signed to play for the 2025 season with Cleveland.Famous for his switch-hitting ability, plate discipline, and clubhouse leadership, he is well-suited to teams in the playoff-ready zone, whether or not his numbers in 2025. His stats (650 OPS, 11 HRs, 52 RBIs) were his lowest ever.Also Read: Chicago Cubs look to strengthen their bullpen with Tommy Romero deal If Santana ends up with the Cubs, as insiders believe is likely, his financial standing brings more than just a dependable bat; it brings a steadiness and a presence to the clubhouse.

What Taco Bell CTO said about using AI in the company’s operations



“Like many people, sometimes it falls short, but other times it really impresses me,”

“For our teams, we’ll help coach them: at your restaurant, at these times, we recommend you use voice AI or recommend that you actually really monitor voice AI and jump in as necessary,”

“I can tell you it’s a very active conversation inside Taco Bell in partnership with our franchisees. I think at the end of the day, it’s really, really early. And we feel that. And I think other brands feel that, too,”

Taco Bell is reconsidering its use of artificial intelligence (AI) for food ordering. This decision from the American fast food chain came after its new voice AI system, which has been installed at over 500 drive-thru locations across the US, received mixed reviews. The company's Chief Digital and Technology Officer, Dane Mathews , admitted they are ""learning a lot"" from the experience. The voice AI has been met with social media complaints about glitches, delays, and general customer discomfort. Some users have also been intentionally ""trolling"" the system with unusual orders, such as asking for “18,000 cups of water.”In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Mathews described his experience with the technology as inconsistent.he said.He added that he is now considering more carefully when it makes sense to rely on the technology. Using AI at every drive-through may not always be practical, he noted. Matthews also pointed out that in busy locations with long lines, a human staff member could manage the situation more effectively.Mathews added that he plans to work with restaurants to help them navigate the decision.he explained.However, Taco Bell is still refining its plans while reviewing data from over two million customer orders handled by AI.Matthews highlighted.Nearly three years into the generative AI wave, companies are still testing and revising their strategies, unsure of where the technology fits best. However, drive-through voice AI remains a challenge.McDonald’s dropped its IBM trial and is now working with Google Cloud, while Wendy’s is also expanding its FreshAi system built on Google tech. On the other hand, Taco Bell’s parent, Yum Brands, has partnered with Nvidia to explore potential AI applicattions.","Taco bell is reconsidering its use of artificial intelligence (ai) for food ordering.

The WhatsApp Scam That Gives Hackers Your Phone!

WhatsApp has said that it uncovered a cyberespionage , or hacking, operation that exploited multiple security vulnerabilities across its platform and Apple devices to conduct targeted surveillance of users, with reportedly civil society activists appearing to be among the primary targets. In a statement issued, the Meta-owned company said that it has plugged the loop holes that hackers used to attack specific users.“Incomplete authorization of linked device synchronization messages in WhatsApp for iOS prior to v2.25.21.73, WhatsApp Business for iOS v2.25.21.78, and WhatsApp for Mac v2.25.21.78 could have allowed an unrelated user to trigger processing of content from an arbitrary URL on a target’s device,” WhatsApp said in a statement.The Meta-owned messaging service disclosed the security breach in a brief statement, revealing that hackers had discovered and weaponised a chain of vulnerabilities that allowed them to compromise both the WhatsApp application and Apple devices in coordinated attacks.“We assess that this vulnerability, in combination with an OS-level vulnerability on Apple platforms (CVE-2025-43300), may have been exploited in a sophisticated attack against specific targeted users,” the company added, without revealing much about the cyber attack.However, a report by news agency Reuters said that an estimated 200 users worldwide have potentially been compromised during the espionage campaign.Donncha O Cearbhaill, who heads Amnesty International's Security Lab, said that members of civic organisations appear to be among those affected by the surveillance operation.“WhatsApp has just sent out a round of threat notifications to individuals they believe where targeted by an advanced spyware campaign in past 90 days. Seek out expert help if you have received this alert,” he said.“Early indications are that the WhatsApp attack is impacting both iPhone and Android users, civil society individuals among them. Government spyware continues to pose a threat to journalists and human rights defenders,” O Cearbhaill wrote in a post on social media platform X.He noted that the Apple vulnerability was in a core image library, advising people that they should update their devices and enable iOS Lockdown Mode or Android‘s Advanced Protection Mode to help protect against attacks like this.",The whatsapp scam that gives hackers your phone!

Former GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke had defended Microsoft 's controversial internal memo requiring managers to evaluate employees based on their AI tool usage , arguing that measuring artificial intelligence adoption should focus on cultural alignment rather than quantifiable metrics like code generation. Speaking on the ""Decoder"" podcast that aired August 7, Dohmke explained that simply counting AI-generated lines of code would be ""easily gamified"" and miss the broader point of fostering an AI-forward organizational mindset. Instead, he emphasized that evaluation should center on whether employees demonstrate willingness to learn and integrate AI tools into their workflow.The former GitHub executive backed a June memo from Julia Liuson, president of Microsoft's developer tools division, which stated that ""using AI is no longer optional"" and should be part of managers' performance evaluations.

Apple Hebbal & Koregaon Park Stores to Open This September

Apple iPhone 17 series will launch on September 9. The Cupertino-based company has scheduled an ‘Awe Dropping’ event for 10:30pm next month where it will unveil 2025 iPhone lineup that may include four models, namely iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max and a slim model rumoured to be called iPhone 17 Plus. ahead of the launch, a new leak has appeared online which says that Apple is also planning to bring a new accessory this year. Tipster Majin Bu says that the company may bring Crossbody Strap, designed primarily for iPhone 17 cases.The upcoming Crossbody Strap is said to feature a flexible metal core to make it fully magnetic along its entire length. Rings at the ends will be polarized opposite to the strap, locking the system firmly for a strong grip. This design makes attaching and removing easy without using hooks or loops, offering a practical option for iPhone 17 cases.The leakster adds that the strap could also be compatible with AirPods Pro 3, expanding its range of uses. The report also shares samples of the upcoming strap which shows a woven nylon body, similar to that used in Sport Loop Bands. Apple may introduce a silicone variant as well. The upcoming iPhone accessory is rumoured to be offered in multiple colour options.Apple’s upcoming iPhone 17 series is expected to feature display sizes similar to the current lineup, with the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max retaining their 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch screens. The new iPhone 17 Air is likely to sit between these two in size. The screen size of the standard iPhone 17 may grow to 6.3 inches, matching the Pro model.Early reports hinted that the slimmer iPhone 17 Air might be a premium device priced higher than the Pro Max. However, sources now indicate it will be a mid-range model, cheaper than both the Pro and Pro Max but more expensive than the standard iPhone 17. This positions it as a direct replacement for the “Plus” model, offering a middle ground in size and price.All four iPhone 17 models are expected to get ProMotion display technology with a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video playback, a feature that was earlier exclusive to Pro models. This upgrade will be made possible by LTPO OLED panels. While LTPO displays also allow for an always-on screen, it is not yet confirmed if this feature will come to all models or remain Pro-only.For the Pro versions, Apple may replace titanium with aluminum for part of the frame, while keeping glass for MagSafe charging. This could result in a half-glass, half-aluminum build that improves durability. A new horizontal pill-shaped camera bump may replace the current square design, with the iPhone 17 Air also tipped to adopt this layout.Powering the iPhone 17 lineup is expected to be Apple’s new A19 Pro chip, built using TSMC’s latest 3nm process for improved speed and power efficiency. For the first time, iPhones could come with 12GB of RAM, allowing smoother multitasking and enabling advanced Apple Intelligence AI features.All iPhone models set to launch in 2025 are rumored to get a major front camera upgrade, moving from the 12-megapixel lens in the iPhone 16 series to a new 24-megapixel sensor. This improvement is expected to deliver sharper photos and allow users to crop images without losing detail.The iPhone 17 Pro Max is tipped to be the first iPhone with three 48-megapixel rear cameras — a Wide, an Ultra Wide, and a Tetraprism Telephoto lens — and may also support 8K video recording for the first time. The iPhone 17 Air is expected to come with a single 48-megapixel rear camera, while the standard iPhone 17 will likely feature a dual-lens setup with Wide and Ultra Wide cameras.The Pro models could introduce a mechanical aperture, allowing users to adjust how much light enters the camera for better control over depth-of-field — a first for iPhones, which currently use fixed apertures. They might also add dual video recording, letting users film with both the front and rear cameras at the same time, a feature popular with content creators but currently limited to some third-party apps.The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will continue to offer a 5x Telephoto optical zoom, which will remain exclusive to the Pro lineup. The standard iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air will not include Telephoto lenses or 5x zoom capabilities.Apple is also said to be working on a 3-year iPhone overhaul strategy with a foldable iPhone coming in 2026.",Apple's iphone 17 series is expected to launch on september 9.

Teen prodigy Kairan Quazi is trading rocket science for Wall Street , leaving SpaceX to join billionaire Ken Griffin 's Citadel Securities as a quantitative developer at just 16 years old. The move marks a significant career pivot for the engineering wunderkind who became the youngest SpaceX employee in company history.""After two years at SpaceX, I felt ready to take on new challenges and expand my skill set into a different high-performance environment,"" Kairan Quazi told Business Insider. ""Citadel Securities offered a similarly ambitious culture, but also a completely new domain, which is very exciting for me.""Kairan Quazi starts this week at the systematic trading giant's New York City office, where he'll work on global trading infrastructure at the intersection of engineering and quantitative problem-solving, according to Business Insider.Despite receiving offers from leading AI laboratories and major tech companies, Kairan Quazi chose quantitative finance for its unique combination of intellectual challenge and immediate feedback. ""Quant finance offers a pretty rare combination: the complexity and intellectual challenge that AI research also provides, but with a much faster pace,"" he explained to Business Insider.At Citadel Securities, Kairan Quazi expects to see measurable impact in days rather than the months or years typical in research environments. The decision represents a notable recruiting win for the trading firm, which competes intensely with AI companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI for top talent.Kairan Quazi's journey began when he skipped from third grade directly to college at age 9. By 10, he was interning at Intel Labs , and at 11, he transferred to Santa Clara University, eventually becoming their youngest graduate in 172 years.SpaceX hired Kairan Quazi at 14 to work on production-critical Starlink satellite systems, where he designed software determining satellite beam targeting for millions of customers. ""I had a very broad scope and a lot of responsibility, especially for a junior engineer,"" Kairan Quazi told Business Insider.The Bangladeshi-American teenager will live within walking distance of Citadel Securities' Manhattan office, eliminating his previous need for his mother to drive him to work in Washington state.

Nvidia on 15% US government ‘cut’

Nvidia reported a revenue of $46.7 billion during the second quarter of its fiscal year 2026. This marked a 6% increase from the previous quarter and a 56% jump year-over-year. In an interview with Yahoo Finance following the company’s earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that the US tech companies can’t be left out of the Chinese market adding that they need to serve as a worldwide standard similar to the US dollar. Jensen Huang said “[President Trump] understands that the American tech stack should be the world standard. Just as the American dollar is the world standard that economies are built on, we want the American tech stack for the world’s technology and industries to be built on, and that includes China.”Speaking about the restoration of sales to China, the CEO of the world's most valuable company said that Nvidia is getting the engine “fired back up” and already has licenses from the US government. “We’ve been approved and licensed to be able to ship to China, and now we’re looking for orders in China,” Jensen Huang added.Explaining further, Huang said “We have every opportunity to succeed in the China market, if they would allow for American technology companies to be able to play there. And so I’m hoping things will get sorted out”.During the interview, Huang also touched upon the opportunity in the networking space. “Just our ethernet product line grew to an annualized rate of $10 billion, and that’s just gotten started. Networking is going to be a very big part of our business. That’s fundamentally recognizing the fusion of computing, networking, and software,” Huang said.During the company’s earnings call, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said the company is still waiting for the Trump administration to finalize an agreement under which Nvidia will pay the US government a 15% share of its sales in China.CEO Jensen Huang added that while Nvidia is in talks with the administration on China, it is not considering the kind of deal Intel made with Washington. “Nor has that come up in discussions,” Huang said.In a Fox Business Network interview, Huang said: ""I don't know that it's 'forced to say yes,' but ultimately, it's in the best interest of the world, of our country, for us to be able to sell in China"" .""So whatever it takes to get it approved for us to be able to sell in China is fine with us,"" he added.",N nvidia reported a revenue of $46.7 billion during the second quarter of its fiscal year 2026.

IIT Madras team builds low-cost chip for rapid antibiotic testing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/iit-madras-team-builds-low-cost-chip-for-rapid-antibiotic-testing/articleshow/123624900.cms,"The global crisis of resistance

Science in miniature

From lab to life-saving tool

Hope on a chip





MUMBAI: In the war against superbugs, time is both ally and enemy. Conventional antimicrobial tests take two to three days to tell doctors which antibiotic can save a patient’s life. By then, many are already placed on broad-spectrum drugs—an emergency shortcut that often fuels the very resistance it seeks to fight. Now, researchers at IIT Madras say they may have cut that waiting period to just three hours.Their invention, a lab-on-chip device called ε-µD, uses electrochemical signals to detect whether bacteria are resistant or susceptible to antibiotics. The device, recently published in Nature Scientific Reports, is designed to be inexpensive, simple to use, and adaptable to clinics with limited infrastructure. If validated in hospitals and scaled, it could offer a game-changing tool for doctors battling life-threatening infections in intensive care units and small-town health centres alike.Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has been flagged by the World Health Organization as one of the top ten threats to human health. In 2019 alone, an estimated 4.95 million deaths worldwide were linked to bacterial resistance.The problem is particularly acute in low- and middle-income countries where diagnostic facilities are scarce, and delays in testing mean antibiotics are often misused or overprescribed.Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (AST)—the gold standard for determining which drug works against which infection—relies on growing bacterial cultures and watching how they respond to antibiotics. But this process takes 48 to 72 hours, a delay that doctors often bridge with guesswork.ε-µD is meant to upend that model. Built around screen-printed carbon electrodes embedded in a microfluidic chip, it avoids costly metals, complex fabrication, or the need for highly trained technicians. By tracking changes in electrical properties of a nutrient solution, the device can tell whether bacteria are growing in the presence of a drug—and therefore whether they are resistant—within hours.“An important aspect of our device is the use of a specially prepared nutrient solution that serves a dual purpose,” explained Prof. S. Pushpavanam, Y B G Varma Institute Chair Professor, Department of Chemical Engineering, IIT Madras. “It not only supports bacterial growth, which is essential for testing, but also enhances the sensitivity of the electrical signals we use for detection. As the bacteria grow, they cause measurable changes in the electrical properties of the solution, which our system can accurately track. ”His colleague, Dr. Richa Karmakar, Assistant Professor in the Department of Biotechnology, broke down the process further: “The device monitors how the electrical signal changes over time to determine whether bacteria are continuing to grow in the presence of an antibiotic. If the bacteria are resistant, they multiply despite the drug, and this activity causes a distinct change in the electrical signal. In contrast, if the bacteria are killed by the antibiotic, their growth is inhibited and the signal remains relatively unchanged. ”The team developed a metric called the Normalized Impedance Signal (NIS) to cleanly distinguish resistant strains from susceptible ones.Early tests are promising. The researchers used the device on two very different bacteria—gram-negative E. coli and gram-positive B. subtilis—with antibiotics that work in different ways. ε-µD was able to deliver susceptibility profiles within three hours. When tested on urine samples spiked with E. coli, the chip successfully detected resistance to tetracycline, demonstrating its clinical relevance.“This approach will make a real impact on patients in Intensive Care Units, who may be suffering from complications due to bacterial infections,” Prof. Pushpavanam said. “This will help the doctors prescribe the right treatment and can be life-saving. Currently, we are doing clinical validation in collaboration with the IITM Institute hospital. After rigorous clinical validation, we are planning to commercialise this through our startup, Kaappon Analytics India Private Limited. ”The innovation meets the World Health Organization’s criteria for next-generation diagnostics: affordable, rapid, reliable, and easy to use. Co-authors include research scholars Saranya Gopalakrishnan (now Director of Technology Innovation at Kaappon Analytics) and Diksha Mall, alongside faculty at IIT Madras.By stripping away complexity and shrinking detection into a microchip, the IIT Madras team has offered a tool that could take critical testing out of elite laboratories and into the reach of rural clinics and resource-limited hospitals.As the race against AMR accelerates, ε-µD embodies what science at its most humane aspires to do: save lives by making innovation accessible.

Why Britain is turning to flywheels for grid stability",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/old-tech-new-power-why-britain-is-turning-to-flywheels-for-grid-stability-all-you-need-to-know-about-the-system/articleshow/123611558.cms,"Representative AI image generated by Denny





Britain is turning to an age-old technology to stabilise its power grid as coal and gas plants are phased out and replaced with renewable energy. Grid operators are increasingly relying on heavy spinning devices called flywheels to provide the inertia once supplied by fossil-fuel power stations, in order to prevent large-scale blackouts.Flywheels, used for centuries in machinery from potters’ wheels to steam engines, can mimic the stabilising effect of turbines in coal and gas plants by responding to sudden fluctuations in electricity supply and demand. Without such rotating systems, ""the system is more prone to fluctuations than it would be otherwise,"" said David Brayshaw, professor of climate science at the University of Reading. ""As we get to ever higher levels of renewables, we're going to have to think about this more carefully,"" he told AFP.The challenge was underscored in April, when Spain and Portugal were hit by a major outage after their renewable-heavy grid failed to absorb a sudden surge in voltage. A similar incident in 2019 plunged parts of Britain into darkness and prompted the National Energy System Operator (NESO) to begin contracting grid-stabilising projects.Among the solutions, flywheels and batteries are being deployed to create “synthetic inertia”.According to engineering professor Keith Pullen of City St George's, University of London, steel flywheels could prove more cost-effective and longer-lasting than lithium-ion batteries. ""I'm not saying that flywheels are the only technology, but they could be a very, very important one,"" said Pullen, who also leads the startup Levistor.One of the flagship projects is Statkraft’s “Greener Grid Park” in Liverpool, operational since 2023. It uses two 40-ton flywheels attached to synchronous compensators to supply about one percent of Britain’s total grid inertia. ""We are providing that inertia without burning any fossil fuels, without creating any carbon emissions,"" said Guy Nicholson, Statkraft’s head of zero-carbon grid solutions. NESO reports that at least 11 similar projects are already operational across the UK, with more on the way.Despite this progress, concerns remain. ""We aren't building them fast enough to decarbonise the grid,"" Nicholson warned, noting Britain’s target of 95 percent clean energy by 2030. ""At the moment... we can't even do it for one hour,"" he added, pointing out that gas turbines are still required to keep the grid stable.The government insists it is working with industry to scale up new stabilisation technologies. A spokesperson for the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero said the UK is collaborating with partners to roll out “world-leading technology, including flywheels, static and synchronous compensators, as we overhaul the energy system.”Still, experts say Britain and Ireland remain ahead of continental Europe in adopting such measures. ""In GB and Ireland, the system operators are leading by contracting these services,"" Nicholson said. ""On the continent, there hasn't been the same drive for that. I think these things are driven by events. So, the Spanish blackout will drive change.""",Britain is turning to an age-old technology to stabilise its power grid as coal and gas plants are phased out.

Surprised by the demand, the car owner recorded the incident and uploaded it to social media, where it has now crossed two million views.In the footage, the owner is heard asking, “for what?” when the student demands £20. She replies, “I just cleaned your window,” prompting him to respond, “you just did a quick wipe. Look, I’m confused – £20?” To this, she insists, “yeah, I mean that is the cost of living.”The exchange escalates as the student blocks the car, warning, “You will have to knock me if you want to leave,” and refusing to let him go without paying. The owner then calls her a “robber,” saying, “this is what robbers look like nowadays apparently.”The video has triggered sharp reactions online, with many users labeling it as “scripted” or “staged” for social media engagement. One user wrote, “Isn’t she the same girl who hit a parked car for insurance, just realised even that was staged.” Another commented, “Staged, this girl appeared in so many videos like this. But it’s not cool as she is damaging the image of India and many people don’t know that it’s just an act. ”Such staged “street encounter” clips, according to users, have become a rising trend on social media, blurring the line between authentic incidents and content created purely for clout.","A video from birmingham has gone viral after capturing a woman, identified online as an indian student, demanding £20.
