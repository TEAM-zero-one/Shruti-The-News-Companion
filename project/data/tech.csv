Brock Purdy’s $50M deal signals 49ers’ big bet on his future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/brock-purdys-50m-deal-signals-49ers-big-bet-on-his-future/articleshow/120905897.cms,"Brock Purdy’s $50M deal signals 49ers' big bet on future QB (Image via: Getty Images)

Brock Purdy’s stats make him worth $50 Million



Is it a MISTAKE for 49ers to pay Brock Purdy? | THE HERD NFL

Is Brock Purdy worth it or 49ers taking a risk too soon?



The San Francisco 49ers are approaching a crossroads, one that could either secure their future or cripple their cap space. Brock Purdy, once an overlooked “Mr. Irrelevant,” is now at the center of a contract saga that's stirring tension in the NFL. After leading the 49ers to consecutive playoff runs and putting up impressive numbers, Purdy is reportedly eyeing a jaw-dropping $50 million per year. That figure doesn't just raise eyebrows, it throws the entire quarterback market into question. Is he worth it? More importantly, can the 49ers afford not to pay him?Purdy has certainly made a strong case for himself. In just three seasons, he’s thrown for 9,518 yards, 64 touchdowns, and only 27 interceptions. He’s taken the team deep into the playoffs and made Shanahan’s offense hum. He’s accurate, calm under pressure, and has shown he can lead with confidence. So, it makes sense that the front office wants to lock him down before his rookie deal runs out.According to The Athletic’s Mike Jones, the 49ers are trying to get the extension done before the season starts partly to avoid any drama or holdouts during training camp. That would give Purdy some long-term security and keep the team focused on the ultimate goal: winning a Super Bowl.But here’s where things get complicated. $50 million per year would put Purdy in the same financial tier as Patrick Mahomes and Joe Burrow quarterbacks who’ve either won a title or consistently dominated. Some fans and analysts wonder if Purdy belongs in that group yet. Others argue he’s earned the payday by doing exactly what the 49ers have asked of him and doing it well.Also Read: Shedeur Sanders: Browns' bold bet that could possibly make or break his career Letting him play out his final rookie year could be a risky move, too. If he continues to shine, his price tag might only go up. And if the 49ers wait too long, another team could come in with a better offer when free agency hits.San Francisco doesn’t want to lose the quarterback who has kept them in championship conversations. Whether this deal ends up being a bargain or a burden will depend on what Purdy does next.","Brock purdy has led the san francisco 49ers to consecutive playoff runs.

Warren Buffett to exit as CEO: Stakeholders weigh on Berkshire Hathaway's future under Greg Abel's leadership,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/warren-buffett-to-exit-as-ceo-stakeholders-weigh-berkshire-hathaways-future-under-greg-abels-leadership/articleshow/120905867.cms,"Warren Buffett to pass baton to Greg Abel

Shareholders of Berkshire Hathaway are contemplating the future of the conglomerate following Warren Buffett 's unexpected announcement of stepping down as chief executive by year end. While most acknowledging that the company will remain stable under Vice Chairman Greg Abel's leadership who Buffett endorsed to be his successor, some stakeholders express concern about the absence of Buffett's unique insight and charisma.The $1.16 trillion organisation, encompassing 189 operating businesses, $264 billion in stocks and $348 billion in cash, faces uncertainty regarding its trajectory post-Buffett era. The announcement came after the annual meeting's question-answer session, with the board scheduled to discuss the transition.""There has been a premium on Berkshire because of Buffett,"" said Mark Malek, chief investment officer at Siebert.NXT, as quoted by news agency Reuters. ""Will people look at it in the same way?""Richard Casterline, a computer programmer from Denver, found the news startling and expressed interest in the market's reaction. He said, ""I don't think (Abel) elicits the same excitement. It's not any fault of his own, it's just thinking of who could be as legendary as those two are. It's just tough shoes to fill.""Despite concerns, Abel receives substantial support. Daniel Hanson senior portfolio manager at Neuberger Berman expressed complete confidence in Abel's capabilities, ""This is Buffett's baby, and he thoughtfully and deliberately planned for an orderly succession that does not disrupt the value of his life's work,"" he said, adding, ""I have full confidence in Greg's leadership.""Richard Lancaster compared the transition to Apple's leadership change from Steve Jobs to Tim Cook and adding, ""You have two different personalities, two different approaches.""""Greg has all the qualities Warren likes in a manager: very sharp individual, and well-versed in what's in the business climate today and the changes that will come through disruptive technologies,"" he also said.Under Buffett's stewardship, Berkshire's shareholder returns have consistently outperformed the S&P 500 (.SPX). The company's investment decisions often influenced market movements, even when Buffett wasn't directly involved.Abel's approach suggests possible adjustments. He indicated increased involvement in subsidiary oversight whilst maintaining their autonomy. Berkshire's diverse portfolio includes Geico insurance, BNSF railway, utilities, Dairy Queen, Fruit of the Loom and See's Candies, as reported by Reuters.The new leadership might adopt different approaches to business retention and divestment. Previously, Berkshire sold Applied Underwriters in 2019 and its newspaper holdings in 2020 due to market changes.","Warren buffett to pass baton to greg abel by year end.

How FarmVille and viral apps powered Facebook's early success

Zuckerberg explains how Apple’s App Store restrictions impacted Facebook’s mobile growth

""The original Facebook platform was really built for the web, before mobile became big.""

Apple’s App Store policies and their impact on Facebook

""When people started using mobile more, Apple told us, ‘You can’t have apps inside your app.’ That hurt something that had grown to be an important part of our business.""

Apple’s privacy and tracking policies

The bitter relationship between Meta and Apple

Apple’s legal challenges and the future of mobile platforms

The digital landscape has been shaped by a series of key players over the years, with Facebook, now Meta, standing at the forefront of the social media revolution. But for all its growth and transformation, the platform has faced significant challenges along the way. One of the more notable struggles came when Facebook 's thriving app and game ecosystem, including the wildly popular FarmVille , saw a dramatic decline.In a recent interview with tech writer Ben Thompson from Stratechery, Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg addressed a critical factor in this decline: Apple ’s strict App Store policies. Zuckerberg explained how Apple’s decisions over the years impacted Facebook’s ability to maintain its business model, particularly its app-based games, and how this shift altered the company’s trajectory in the mobile era.In the late 2000s, Facebook was at the peak of its desktop-based platform, where games and apps played a significant role in the platform's growth. The social network quickly became a hub for developers looking to create interactive content that would engage its growing user base. Games like FarmVille, Mafia Wars, and Texas HoldEm Poker captured the attention of millions, providing Facebook with a fresh revenue stream. By 2012, these apps contributed to about 20% of the company’s revenue, marking a high point for Facebook’s game platform.This success was primarily driven by Facebook’s ability to integrate its game platform into the broader Facebook experience, allowing users to discover and share apps with their friends. The platform was tailored for the web, and developers used Facebook’s social features to create viral games. As the desktop experience dominated, it seemed that Facebook’s app ecosystem would only continue to thrive.However, the rise of smartphones and mobile apps introduced a massive shift in the way people engaged with the internet. The advent of the iPhone and other smartphones ushered in a new era of app-based experiences that would change the way users interacted with social media and online games. As mobile platforms began to dominate, Zuckerberg and his team recognized that Facebook’s future would depend on successfully adapting to the mobile revolution.Unfortunately, Facebook’s smooth transition from desktop to mobile wasn't as seamless as they hoped. Zuckerberg recalled,The company’s model, which relied heavily on web-based interactions, needed to be overhauled to thrive in an app-centric mobile environment.It was at this point that Zuckerberg pointed to Apple’s App Store policies as a significant hurdle for Facebook's continued success in the mobile space. Facebook had initially planned to leverage its own app platform inside the iPhone to continue growing its mobile app and game ecosystem. However, Apple’s stringent rules soon made this impossible.In the early days of mobile app development, Apple implemented rules that severely restricted how companies like Facebook could operate within the App Store. One of the key policies that Zuckerberg highlighted was Apple’s decision to block Facebook from running its own app platform inside the iPhone. Zuckerberg explained,This policy change effectively cut Facebook off from the ability to operate a platform that could support games and apps in the same way it had on desktop. As a result, Facebook's ability to host third-party applications, which had been a core part of its business model, was significantly diminished. While Apple argued that these policies were necessary for maintaining the security and quality of apps on its platform, the restriction ultimately stifled the growth of Facebook’s app-based ecosystem.The ramifications were immediate and profound: Facebook’s once-booming app and game business started to decline, and developers who had once relied on Facebook’s platform for distribution were forced to adapt to the new constraints. Zuckerberg noted that by limiting Facebook’s access to key tools and changing the company’s relationship with developers, Apple set off a chain of events that led to the decline of its game and app platform.In addition to the restrictions on Facebook’s app platform, Zuckerberg also pointed to Apple’s privacy policies as a factor that further undermined Facebook’s mobile business. Specifically, Apple’s introduction of App Tracking Transparency (ATT) in 2020 made it more difficult for companies like Facebook to track user behavior across different apps and websites. This update, which required apps to ask users for permission before collecting data for targeted advertising, was seen as a direct challenge to Facebook’s ad-driven revenue model.For Facebook, which had built its business around precise ad targeting, this policy change was a blow to its ability to effectively monetize its platform. Zuckerberg expressed frustration with Apple’s stance, noting that its policies had placed significant limitations on how Facebook could operate in the mobile space.Zuckerberg’s comments on Apple reveal a deeper sense of frustration and bitterness between the two tech giants. He described Apple’s decisions as creating ""deep bitterness"" and emphasized the company’s refusal to consider the value Facebook’s platform could bring to the iPhone ecosystem. Zuckerberg argued that Apple’s approach was too restrictive and that it limited the potential for collaboration between the two companies.He expressed his belief that mobile platforms should be more open, similar to traditional desktop systems such as Windows or macOS, where developers have more freedom to build their own ecosystems and offer a wider range of services. Zuckerberg lamented that Apple’s ""walled garden"" approach prevented Facebook from fully realizing its potential in the mobile era.Zuckerberg’s comments come at a time when Apple is facing increasing legal scrutiny over its App Store policies. Recently, a U.S. judge ruled that Apple had violated an earlier order by continuing to block developers from linking users to external payment options. This ruling is part of a broader legal battle in which Apple is being accused of maintaining an illegal monopoly over the app market. Apple is also facing an antitrust lawsuit from the U.S. Department of Justice, which claims that the company’s practices harm competition in the smartphone industry.For Zuckerberg and Meta, these developments offer a glimmer of hope that Apple’s ""walled garden"" may eventually start to open up, allowing for greater freedom for developers and a more open mobile platform. As regulators push back against Apple’s control over the App Store, Zuckerberg and other tech leaders may see this as an opportunity for a more balanced and competitive mobile ecosystem.","Facebook founder mark zuckerberg explains how apple’s app store restrictions impacted facebook's mobile growth.

Is GTA 6 connected to previous games?

The game is expected to have a new setting (modern Vice City) and new characters but may include easter eggs or references to previous titles.

Rockstar Games has finally confirmed the release date for GTA 6, setting the launch for May 26, 2026. The announcement comes after years of speculation, rumors, and growing anticipation from fans and the gaming industry alike. With over a decade having passed since the release of Grand Theft Auto V in September 2013, GTA 6 has become one of the most eagerly awaited video game sequels in history.The initial expectation had targeted a release in late 2025, but Rockstar has now pushed the launch into the following year, citing quality standards and development needs as the primary reasons. This long-awaited update confirms the studio’s commitment to delivering a title that meets the expectations set by its predecessor and decades of innovation in the open-world gaming genre.Rockstar Games announced the official release date as May 26, 2026, in a public statement released on May 2, 2025. This announcement confirmed what many had suspected—that the previously anticipated 2025 window would not be met. The company emphasized that the delay was necessary to uphold the quality and depth that fans expect from the franchise.Rockstar stated.The studio added that the additional time will allow developers to “deliver at the level of quality you expect and deserve,” suggesting that final touches, optimizations, and polishing are ongoing.The delay from a projected Fall 2025 release to May 2026 has been attributed to the high development standards associated with Rockstar’s flagship titles. Since the overwhelming success of GTA V—which became one of the best-selling video games of all time with over 185 million copies sold—expectations for its successor have been immense.Factors influencing the delay likely include:Rockstar’s statement did not mention a specific reason for the delay beyond a focus on quality, but industry analysts have noted that development timelines for AAA games have generally expanded due to increasingly complex technology and player expectations.Despite the long development timeline, Rockstar has released only one official trailer for GTA 6—premiering in December 2023. The trailer introduced players to a modern-day Vice City, Rockstar’s fictional version of Miami, Florida. The game is expected to feature dual protagonists, reportedly named Lucia and Jason, marking the first time a female playable lead will be included in the series.Key details from the trailer and Rockstar’s previous statements include:Although no new images or footage were released alongside the May 2025 release date announcement, Rockstar has promised more information will be shared “soon.”The announcement of the 2026 release date has triggered a mixed but largely understanding response from the fan community. While many expressed disappointment at the delay, most acknowledged Rockstar’s commitment to quality. Social media platforms such as Twitter, Reddit, and Discord saw trending discussions immediately following the announcement.In the stock market, Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, saw minor fluctuations but remained stable, indicating long-term investor confidence in the title's eventual commercial success.With the official date now set, it is expected that Rockstar will release additional trailers, gameplay demos, and developer insights in the second half of 2025. These previews may include:Fans can likely anticipate new content drops during major gaming events such as Gamescom 2025, The Game Awards, or dedicated Rockstar livestreams.Though Rockstar has not yet confirmed the platforms for GTA 6, it is widely expected that the game will launch on:Support for older-generation consoles such as the PlayStation 4 or Xbox One is considered unlikely due to technical limitations.The game is also expected to utilize Rockstar’s upgraded RAGE (Rockstar Advanced Game Engine), with enhanced realism in animations, AI behavior, and environmental interactivity.","Rockstar games announced the official release date as may 26, 2026, in a public statement released on may 2, 2025.

Read the complete open letter from CEOs





“WHAT IF A SINGLE CLASS COULD HELP CLOSE WAGE GAPS, UNLOCK $660 BILLION IN ECONOMIC POTENTIAL EVERY YEAR FOR EVERYDAY AMERICANS, AND ADDRESS THE SKILLS GAP WE CURRENTLY FACE?

This is possible, today — if we include computer science and AI as a core part of every student’s education.

Just one high school computer science course boosts wages by 8% for all students, regardless of career path or whether they attend college.

Yet, most students never even try computer science, because it’s not a graduation requirement. Only 12 states require students to learn even basic computer science.

This is not just an educational issue; it’s about closing skills and income gaps that have persisted for generations.

It’s also about keeping America competitive. Countries like Brazil, China, S. Korea, and Singapore have already made computer science or AI mandatory for every student. The United States is falling behind.

In the age of AI, we must prepare our children for the future — to be AI creators, not just consumers. A basic foundation in computer science and AI is crucial for helping every student thrive in a technology-driven world. Without it, they risk falling behind.

How can we accept this? We have a responsibility to prepare the next generation for the new American Dream. We owe it to them to provide an education that reflects the demands of our time.

Change is already underway. This movement has bipartisan support from leaders on both sides of the aisle. In the past 10 years, all 50 states have taken steps forward, and 100,000 teachers have started teaching computer science.

But we can’t stop here. We must make computer science and AI a required part of every school’s curriculum. Together, we can unlock $660 billion in opportunity for everyday Americans, close wage gaps and ensure our children are prepared for the challenges and opportunities of tomorrow.”

Over 250 CEOs and technology leaders, including Microsoft 's Satya Nadella , Adobe's Shantanu Narayen, IBM's Arvind Krishna , and Cognizant's Ravi Kumar S, have signed an open letter warning that the United States is falling behind globally in preparing students for an AI-driven future. The coalition also includes prominent leaders from Airbnb, Uber, LinkedIn, and Salesforce, all calling for computer science and AI to become mandatory components of K-12 education nationwide.""In the age of AI, we must prepare our children for the future — to be AI creators, not just consumers,"" the letter states, pointing out that countries like Brazil, China, South Korea, and Singapore have already made computer science or AI mandatory for every student.Other prominent signatories include Marc Benioff (Salesforce), Michael Dell , CEO and founder of Dell, LinkedIn founder Reid Hoffman , and former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer .The campaign highlights research showing that just one high school computer science course can boost wages by 8% for all students, regardless of their eventual career path. Advocates argue that making these subjects required rather than elective could unlock $660 billion in economic potential annually and help close persistent skills and income gaps.Currently, only 12 states require students to learn even basic computer science. While all 50 states have taken steps to expand computer science education in the past decade, the letter's signatories argue this progress is insufficient given the rapid advancement of AI technologies across all industries.The bipartisan-supported initiative, spearheaded by organizations like Code.org and CSforALL, emphasizes that computer science education is not just about creating more tech workers, but about ensuring all American students have the foundation they need to thrive in an increasingly technology-driven world economy.""This is not just an educational issue; it's about closing skills and income gaps that have persisted for generations,"" the letter continues, urging policymakers, educators, and communities to join the effort to make computer science and AI education accessible to every student.","Just one high school computer science course boosts wages by 8% for all students, regardless of career path or whether they attend college.

Huffman says Silicon Valley has an entitlement problem



From idealism to business reality, how Huffman changed Reddit



Reddit CEO Steve Huffman revealed he had to implement a culture shift when he returned to the company in 2015, pushing employees to abandon excessive idealism in favor of practical business goals and increased productivity. ""Wrapped up in some of that idealism was also like, not working very hard,"" Huffman said on the ""Prof G Pod"" podcast released Sunday, describing the workplace culture he encountered upon his return as chief executive.The Reddit co-founder diagnosed this issue as symptomatic of broader tech industry culture, particularly in the Bay Area, where he perceives an attitude of entitlement.""In the Bay Area broadly is this, it's almost an entitlement of, 'I work at these companies but I don't have to work very hard and I'm here for myself,'"" Huffman explained.Huffman recounted telling employees: ""Look, we have to work really, really hard. We're in a competitive space.""The CEO's leadership transformation came during a critical period for Reddit, which he co-founded with Alexis Ohanian in 2005 before departing and later returning in 2015 to turn the company around.""We were really idealistic, and I think in many ways the idealism has been very good, but we were also idealistic about not being a business — which is not a great way to run a sustainable business,"" he said.Huffman's strategy shift appears to have paid dividends. Reddit went public in March 2024, with its stock surging 70% on the first trading day. The company is now valued at approximately $21 billion following impressive first-quarter earnings that showed a 61% year-over-year revenue increase to $392.4 million.""If we don't work really hard and work really smart and make this thing successful both from a user point of view and business point of view, then we don't get to do this, and we'll never achieve our mission,"" Huffman emphasized regarding his leadership philosophy.",Reddit ceo steve huffman says silicon valley has an entitlement problem.

""Consistently high"" performance now prioritized at Amazon





Amazon is overhauling its compensation model to significantly favor longtime top performers while reducing payouts for first-time high achievers and those with inconsistent performance records. Under the new guidelines, veteran employees with consistent excellence stand to gain substantially more than their newer counterparts. According to internal guidelines obtained by Business Insider, employees who earn Amazon's ""Top Tier"" performance rating for four consecutive years will now receive 110% of their pay range, exceeding the previous cap of 100%. Meanwhile, first-time Top Tier recipients will get 70% of their pay band, down from 80% last year.""This approach ensures a steadier compensation progression,"" states the internal pay guideline, referring to the company's total compensation target metric. An Amazon spokesperson explained that the updated model ""better distinguishes between newer high performers and those who have consistently exceeded expectations for their role and level.""The revised structure places greater emphasis on an employee's rating history rather than just current performance. Employees moving from lower ratings to Highly Valued 2 (HV2) will receive 10% of their pay range instead of the previous 20%, while those who drop from Highly Valued 3 (HV3) to HV2 will maintain 20%, indicating the company's increased focus on past achievements.Similarly, first-time HV3 recipients will receive 40% of their pay range rather than 50%, while employees with two consecutive Top Tier ratings will get 90% of their band instead of the previous 100%.Amazon's move represents a significant shift in how the e-commerce giant distributes compensation across its workforce. The changes clearly benefit employees who maintain top performance over multiple years while potentially disadvantaging newer high achievers and those with inconsistent performance records. Other technology companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta have also implemented similar performance-based compensation strategies, with stricter review policies and reduced rewards for underperformers.Amazon's compensation structure has previously faced internal criticism for its lack of transparency and competitive nature of employee rankings. Managers are instructed not to share individual Overall Value (OV) ratings with employees, forcing staff to infer their performance based on compensation changes.The company will continue its pilot program allowing employees to take 25% of their new stock awards in cash, addressing concerns from employees seeking more immediate financial returns rather than stock-based compensation.Despite these adjustments, Amazon maintains that most employees who demonstrated performance improvements still saw pay increases this year, with the spokesperson adding that the company offers ""multiple channels"" through which employees can raise concerns about their compensation.","Amazon's new pay model rewards veteran top performers, cuts first-time achievers.

"Trump tariff hit: Ford withdraws 2025 forecast, Q1 profits fall by 65%, revenues fall to $40 billion",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-tariff-hit-ford-withdraws-2025-forecast-q1-profits-fall-by-65-revenues-fall-to-40-billion/articleshow/120916802.cms,"Automobile giant Ford hit a huge bump in its first quarter profits, reporting a sharp fall of 65% on Monday. The company also withdrew its forecast for 2025 amid tariff uncertainty as auto sales fell due to the launch of new vehicles.The company posted $471 million in profits for the quarter, a figure that exceeded analyst expectations but was just a third of its earnings over the same period last year, while revenues fell by five percent to $40.7 billion.It reported a 7% drop in wholesale units, a decline it had flagged earlier, blaming slower production at its Kentucky and Michigan plants where new vehicle launches are underway.Ford is now estimating a $1.5 billion annual hit to adjusted operating earnings due to tariffs, which have hit a lot of companies and productions since Trump returned to the White House in January. These include levies on imported vehicles, steel, aluminium, and auto parts.Despite efforts to cushion the blow, including shifting vehicle shipments from Mexico to Canada and avoiding duties on parts that only transit through the US, the company expected the total impact of tariffs to reach $2.5 billion. Supply chain tweaks have helped shave $1 billion off that figure so far.“Our teams have done a lot to minimize the impact of tariffs on our business,” said chief financial officer Sherry House, as quoted by AFP.Ford’s “Pro” division, which targets fleet and commercial buyers, and its “Blue” division, covering traditional petrol and diesel models, both saw profits slide. However, losses narrowed in the electric vehicle segment.Chief executive Jim Farley said Ford was staying “very aggressive” in the market, extending an employee-pricing promotion to drive retail sales. The company reported a lift in April sales thanks to the campaign but warned that prices could start climbing later this year as tariff costs filter through to consumers.House acknowledged the possibility of a “potential compression” in sales during the second half of 2025. Overall, the carmaker now anticipates full-year sales to remain flat or rise by only around one percent.The US auto giant described its underlying business “strong,” claiming that it had aligned with the prior projection of falling in the range of $7 to $8.5 billion in adjusted operating earnings, apart from tariff related impacts.Adding to the challenges are concerns over changes to US emissions policies and restrictions by China on rare earth elements, which are essential for auto manufacturing. Chief operating officer Kumar Galhotra said that such moves could disrupt production for Ford or its competitors, potentially altering pricing strategies across the sector.Ford shares dropped 2.3% in after-hours trading following the announcement.",Ford reports 65% fall in first quarter profits to $471 million.

Designers do a double take at the lettering on Pope Francis' tombstone,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/designers-do-a-double-take-at-the-lettering-on-pope-francis-tombstone/articleshow/120914756.cms,"



The arrangements for the funeral of Pope Francis were meticulous, and the ceremony drew a global audience. But it is the arrangement of the letters on his tombstone that are now attracting outsize attention. The simple slab has only 10 letters, but the spacing between them can make it read like ""F R A NCISC VS.""The lettering is meant to be read as Franciscus, the derivative of the pope's name in Latin. (V stood for both u and v in Latin.) Pope Francis' marble tomb fulfills his desire for an unadorned final resting place. In that sense, the tombstone lettering in Times Roman, a workmanlike font widely used in the English, could be considered appropriate. But for those who obsess about kerning, the space between letters, the view from above the tomb is not exactly an aesthetically pleasing one.""Woe be unto the person who decided to do it the way that they did it, just because it's a bad decision that will last for a long time, unless they change it,"" said Charles Nix of Monotype, one of world's largest typeface and technology companies. The double take for some when they look at the letters is caused by the lack of kerning between pairs of letters.So what happened at the Vatican? ""It may have been laid out as individual letters, and not actually typed,"" Nix said, adding for centuries, people have tried to figure out a mathematical way to engrave letters, and it always fails.A representative of Vatican could not immediately be reached for comment about the lettering. A lack of kerning is common on grave markers, Nix said, especially those from the 20th century onward because they are produced very mathematically. An editor at Fast Company magazine was among the first to notice the discordance. Other more casual observers pointed to the ""A"" in Franciscus standing apart from other letters. ""Why does it look like pressing on the letter 'A' will open a secret chamber where the ark of the covenant is stored?"" asked Elle Cordova, a digital creator. ""Pope's name was just cranked out by someone operating a stonecutting machine, probably via sandblasting from a template prepared on a computer,"" said Paul Shaw, a type and design historian.Evan Sult, an art director and designer, wrote: ""We all recognise there are far more fundamentally significant aspects of lived life than how text is presented, the life and legacy of the Pope being perhaps one of the ultimate examples. Which makes it all the more incredible when the moment arrives where the typography plays its key role in the symphony of shared experience ... and utterly blows the note.""","Pope francis' tombstone has 10 letters, but the spacing between them can make it read like ""f r a ncisc vs."" the lettering is meant to be read as franciscus, the derivative of the pope's name in latin.

"Australia government to continue working on cutting net migration, hiking minimum pay for skilled workers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/australia-government-to-continue-working-on-cutting-net-migration-hiking-minimum-pay-for-skilled-workers/articleshow/120914450.cms,"



Australia's immigration policy under PM Anthony Albanese's Labour government will continue to prioritise skilled workers to meet market needs while curbing net migration. With the Labour Party's re-election, the country will continue on its path of reducing net-migration, increasing salary thresholds for skilled visa programmes, and raising visa fees for international students.The Indian diaspora is the second largest in Australia, with over 8.5 lakh Indian-born residents as of June 2023 - more than twice the number of 3.8 lakh as on June 30, 2013.However, tighter visa norms have seen annual visa allotments drop. In 2023-24, only 50,516 student visas were issued to Indian nationals, down from 1.02 lakh in the previous year. Similarly, the number of temporary skilled employment visas issued had dropped from 27,402 to 18,397.In Dec 2023, the Australian government announced that net migration will be halved within two years from a record high of 5.1 lakh by imposing tougher tests on international students and focusing on workers with high skills attuned to market needs. The net overseas migration numbers were projected to fall to 2,50,000 in 2024-25; followed by 2,55,000 in 2025-26 and 2,35,000 in 2026-27.Teresa Liu, managing partner (Australia & New Zealand) at Fragomen, a global immigration law firm, said, ""We expect the current set of reforms on the Skilled Visa Program and the migration strategy reform agenda to continue.The main takeaway for aspiring employees and indeed employers or Indian businesses doing business in Australia, is that from a policy perspective, it is largely business as usual. However, the more 'mundane' or expected changes in occupation lists and salary thresholds are expected to be announced in July. ""Last Dec, Australia introduced the 'Skills-in-demand' visa and replaced the earlier regime. This visa offers pathways for 'specialist', 'core', and 'essential' skills occupations. As part of ongoing reforms, salary thresholds for the core skills occupations will rise from AUD 73,150 to AUD 76,515, while the specialist skills income threshold will rise from AUD 135,000 to AUD 141,210. These changes will impact employers and prospective employees, requiring them to plan ahead, added Liu.Last year, the Australia government failed in its earlier attempt to cap student intake, however, an increase in visa fees come July seems imminent. The current fee of AUD 1,600 was set in July 2024, which was a 125% increase from the previous fee of AUD 710. Their revised outlook includes a plan to increase the application fee for an Australian study visa by AUD 400 to stand at AUD 2,000.","The indian diaspora is the second largest in australia, with over 8.5 lakh indian-born residents.

Bangladesh Currency Crisis: Bangladesh faces currency crisis as central bank halts issuing notes featuring Mujibur Rahman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-faces-currency-crisis-as-central-bank-halts-issuing-notes-featuring-mujibur-rahman/articleshow/120714882.cms,"Approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused

DHAKA: The central bank of Bangladesh has apparently incurred a huge financial loss due to the interim govt’s decision not to issue previously printed notes, with approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remaining unused. The decision aligns with govt’s efforts to diminish Bangabandhu’s presence in public memory.Although bank officials are unwilling to discuss the matter publicly, many, on conditions of anonymity, said the longstanding tradition of obtaining new notes from Bangladesh Bank has been abruptly halted, creating a crisis in the market. On the one hand, the printed money is being wasted without use; on the other hand, customers are suffering as a result, they added.“Notes of various denominations are printed using paper and ink purchased with people’s taxes. Millions of notes with Bangabandhu’s picture are still lying in the vaults of various banks. The Security Printing Corporation does not have the capacity to cancel all the notes at once and print new ones. Therefore, notes with Bangabandhu’s picture cann’t be suddenly cancelled,” Ziauddin Ahmed, former executive director of Bangladesh Bank and former managing director of Security Printing Corporation, told reporters.In this situation, he suggested the printed notes be circulated in the market to alleviate public suffering. “When new design notes come into the market, the old ones should be gradually withdrawn. Generally, notes printed once can be used for a maximum of four to five years,” Ahmed said.According to media reports, Bangladesh Bank is unable to issue new notes to banks in line with demand. The crisis became evident following the country’s political upheaval in Aug last year.Since all forms of currency, including metal coins, feature Mujibur’s image, Bangladesh Bank abruptly stopped issuing new notes early April. As a result, the notes featuring Bangabandhu’s image are not reaching the market. Shops, banks, and citizens are now left with torn and old, dirty notes.According to sources at Bangladesh Bank, the Security Printing Corporation is set to begin printing new design notes next month. In the first phase, new design notes of 20, 50, and 1,000 taka will be printed and subsequently released in the market through banks.","Approximately taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused.

Pomp and secrecy

Digital turn





PARIS: Hype has been building on social media around the Catholic Church's secretive, centuries-old tradition of conclaves to elect a new pope, animating users from the White House on down.US President Donald Trump on Saturday posted an apparently AI-generated image of himself wearing papal vestments and sitting on a throne, one finger directed to the heavens.The striking picture was the most notorious among thousands that have bubbled up since the death of Pope Francis on April 21 and ahead of the cardinals' gathering from Wednesday.More than 1.3 million tweets have been published on X about the conclave, according to monitoring platform Visibrain, while TikTok videos on the topic have been viewed over 363 million times on the network with unparallelled reach among the young.Particularly passionate pope-watchers can fire up online game ""Mantapa"" to pick their favourite cardinals and make predictions for the next pontiff in a style similar to sports betting.The mystery, pomp and ritual around the conclave, from the opulent Sistine Chapel surroundings to the ethereal black or white smoke signalling ballot results, ""lends itself to the narrative formats of social networks"" said Refka Payssan, a researcher in information and communication sciences.""A conclave means both gilt, protocol, ceremony, but also secrecy and mystery"" cannily nurtured by the Vatican, agreed Stephanie Laporte, founder of digital strategy consultancy OTTA.""Young people love to speculate"" about outcomes, Laporte added.""Everyone on social networks has an opinion and everyone wants to decode the news, look for clues, know which cardinal will become the pope. It's almost like an 'escape game',"" she suggested.Payssan noted that the conclave fires up the ""curiosity of seeing history happen live"", marking a rare event, the first in 12 years, with potential global consequences.Even if not Catholic themselves, ""young people are very conscious of the pope's influence on hundreds of millions, even billions of people, whether it's in his stance on contraception or the environment,"" Laporte said.Conclave fever is also a reflection of the Vatican's successful turn to digital communications in recent years to build bonds with younger generations.Created by Benedict XVI in 2012 but mostly used by Francis, the papal X account @pontifex reaches 50 million followers across its nine languages.And Francis's own Instagram account had more than 10 million followers.The Church has backed many cardinals' own ventures into the digital realm, with some becoming bona fide internet stars.New York prelate Timothy Dolan has been publishing videos about the run-up to the conclave to his almost 300,000 X followers and 55,000 on Instagram, without giving away any sensitive information.Moderate Philippine cardinal Luis Antonio Tagle has made his mark online with karaoke videos, tallying 600,000 Facebook followers.Selfie snapshots are in the mix, with Tokyo's archbishop Tarcisio Isao Kikuchi posting a photo with colleagues from the bus on the way to pray at Francis's grave.Cardinals ""are absolutely fascinating personalities who've taken their place in pop culture,"" firing public enthusiasm for the event, Laporte said.That fascination has been stoked by pop culture blockbusters like Dan Brown's novel ""Angels and Demons"", adapted for film in 2009, or the acclaimed thriller ""Conclave"" released this year, based on a book by novelist Robert Harris.","Hype has been building on social media around the catholic church's secretive, centuries-old tradition of conclaves.

SYDNEY: New Zealand's prime minister on Tuesday proposed banning children under 16 from social media, stressing the need to protect them from the perils of big tech platforms.Regulators the world over are wrestling with how to keep children safe online, as social media is increasingly flooded with violent and disturbing content.Prime Minister Christopher Luxon unveiled draft laws that would force social media companies to verify users were at least 16 years old, or face fines of up to NZ$2 million (US$1.2 million).The proposed ban was modelled on that of Australia, which sits at the forefront of global efforts to regulate social media.""This is about protecting our children. It's about making sure social media companies are playing their role in keeping our kids safe,"" Luxon said.It was not clear when the legislation would be introduced to parliament, but Luxon said he was hopeful of garnering support across the chamber.The laws were drafted by Luxon's centre-right National Party, the biggest member in New Zealand's three-way governing coalition.To be passed they would need the support of Luxon's two other coalition partners.""Parents are constantly telling us that they are really worried about the impact that social media is having on their children,"" Luxon said.""And they say they are really struggling to manage access to social media.""Australia passed landmark laws in November banning under-16s from social media, one of the world's toughest crackdowns on popular sites such as Facebook, Instagram and X.The move sparked a fierce backlash from big tech companies who variously described the laws as ""rushed"", ""vague"", and ""problematic"".","Prime minister christopher luxon unveiled draft laws that would force social media companies to verify users were at least 16.
