BENGALURU: Prof Vaidyeswaran Rajaraman, widely regarded as the ""Pitamah"" of computer science education in India, passed away due to age-related ailments at his Tatanagar residence here on Saturday aged 92. The students he taught included Faqir Chand Kohli, the first CEO of TCS, and Infosys founder NR Narayana Murthy.Instrumental in establishing India's first formal academic programme in computer science in 1965 at IIT Kanpur, Rajaraman laid the foundation for the nation's technological revolution.Born in 1933, Prof Rajaraman dedicated more than six decades to shaping India's computing landscape.""I was his student at IIT Kanpur in the late Sixties. He was a scholar and a gentleman. He and his very kind wife, Dharma, were like guardians for every student in the EE department at IITK. He was always available for any mentoring,"" Narayana Murthy said.As chairman of the Supercomputer Education and Research Centre (SERC) at IISc from 1982 to 1994, Prof Rajaraman built India's supercomputing and parallel computing capabilities, empowering research institutions with advanced computational resources.His vision led to the creation of the master of computer applications (MCA) programme for science and commerce graduates, addressing critical human resource needs in the emerging IT industry. In 1987, chairing a committee set up by the Science Advisory Council to the Prime Minister, he recommended establishing the Centre for the Development of Advanced Computing to develop indigenous supercomputers.""He is one of the great visionaries who thought of supercomputers when people didn't know if it was spelt as one word or two. In computer education, there are no two opinions about his contributions at all. Above all, he was a great human being. I've never seen him angry in all my years of association with him. It is a great loss,"" Prof N Balakrishnan (Balki), a supercomputer expert instrumental in establishing SERC, told TOI.Infosys co-founder Kris Gopalakrishnan, said: ""Prof Rajaraman is the doyen of Indian computer science education... His textbooks are the first introduction to programming for many Indian students. We have lost a pioneer of the computer industry in India.""Prof Rajaraman's contributions to e-governance were transformative. As a member of Karnataka's Technical Advisory Panel (1985-2014), he guided landmark initiatives, including the Bhoomi project for land registration and the Kaveri project for property registration, pioneering digital governance in India.Prof Vaidyeswaran Rajaraman received the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar Prize (1976) and was honoured with the Padma Bhushan in 1998.Prof Rajaraman, whose final rites were performed Saturday, is survived by his wife Dharma Rajaraman.","Prof vaidyeswaran rajaraman, widely regarded as the ""pitamah"" of computer science education in india, passed away on saturday.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification







Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A life certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

'Don't lecture about Indian literacy rates': American CEO James Fishback's jibe at Vivek Ramaswamy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dont-lecture-about-indian-literacy-rates-american-ceo-james-fishbacks-jibe-at-vivek-ramaswamy/articleshow/125161003.cms,"CEO James Fishback took a veiled dig at Vivek Ramaswamy as he mentioned India, maths olympiad in his recent America First speech.





Azoria CEO and ex-DOGE architect James Fishback took a dig at GOP leader Vivek Ramaswamy without naming him and said Americans should not be apologetic about who they are and nobody should lecture Americans on India's literacy or Chinese maths. Americans won't change their culture for a maths olympiad or for a Chemistry exam, Fishback said as he was giving a speech at Boston University College Republicans. The ex-DOGE architect has emerged as a strong anti-H-1B voice.""We don't want ANYONE lecturing us about Indian literacy rates or Chinese math rates. Cut the crap now. We’re Americans. We’re talented. We’re smart. And no, we’re not giving up church on Sunday for more math tutoring. We’re not skipping Friday Night Lights because there’s a chemistry test to cram for. The second we stop apologizing for who we are, we will start winning again!"" Fishback said.The America First CEO has been pushing for completely stopping the H-1B visa program and said that a foreigner should only come to the US for tourism.Fishback's reference to math tutoring, chemistry test was a jibe at Indian-origin Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy who last year created a major uproar in the H-1B controversy as he attacked American culture to justify the H-1B program.Ramaswamy said American culture worships mediocrity over excellence, celebrates prom queen over math olympiad and hence tech companies need to hire foreign employees as there is a dearth of Americans in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.While Vivek's critique of American culture turned out to be a watershed moment for MAGA, with Vivek becoming sidelined, the H-1B conundrum still persists. The Donald Trump administration has imposed a $100,000 fee on hiring H-1Bs, making it difficult for tech companies to hire from foreign countries. Florida has recently announced a ban on H-1Bs in Florida colleges and universities as Governor Ron DeSantis revealed that instead of special positions, the colleges and universities made foreign hiring for some very basic posts, like a public policy professor from China, a graphic designer from Canada.","Azoria ceo and ex-doge architect james fishback took a dig at gop leader vivek ramaswamy without naming him.

What is the conflict over Apple CarPlay Ultra

Apple's Secret 3-Year Plan: A New iPhone Era is Coming!





Ford CEO Jim Farley has joined a list of auto makers who are raising concerns about Apple’s expanding control over in-car systems through its new CarPlay Ultra platform. “We don’t like the execution of Ultra in round one,” Farley told The Verge, adding “I’ve talked to Tim [Cook] many times about this. Ford does not have the right, in our opinion, to disrupt someone’s digital life when they get in their car”.Farley further warned that Apple needs to make a decision on how much it wants to encroach into a vehicle system. “How far do you want the Apple brand to go? Do you want the Apple brand to start the car? Do you want the Apple brand to limit the speed? Do you want the Apple brand to limit access?”, a furious Farley question.“The difference between car companies where you have a software-defined vehicle is not going to be what your sheet metal looks like. It won’t be how powerful your EV motor is. That’s all math. All the cars look nice. It’s going to be this digital experience that says why someone buys this or that,” he further said.Introduced earlier this year, Apple CarPlay Ultra is the latest generation of CarPlay, enabling iPhone users to display car functions like fuel level and speed.Other than mirroring iPhone’s screen, CarPlay also lets drivers control the air conditioning, radio, and driving modes, all from the same screen.Currently, only Aston Martin is the only automaker that has fully integrated CarPlay Ultra into its vehicles. According to a Financial Times report, other automakers, including Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Polestar, Volvo, Renault, and others have no plans to integrate the new system into their cars.But the conflict heated up when General Motors (GM) CEO Mary Barra said the company’s future vehicles will no longer support Apple CarPlay or its Google counterpart, Android Auto.","Ford ceo jim farley has joined a list of auto makers who are raising concerns about apple’s expanding control over in-car systems through its new carplay ultra platform. “we don’t like the execution of ultra in round one,” farley said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125135370,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-30830,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Scale AI CFO pushes back: “We are alive and well”





Mark Zuckerberg unveils three new Meta AI smart glasses

Business is still booming





Moving ahead without Alexandr Wang





Facebook-parent Meta stunned the Silicon Valley in June this year by announcing a $14.3 billion investment in AI startup — Scale AI. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made this investment to primarily onboard Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang and other top executives of the company. This move by Meta trigged an immediate speculation about the Scale AI’s viability, with major clients like OpenAI, Google, and Elon Musk’s xAI reportedly pausing work with the startup. The industry insiders also felt that the company had been effectively acquired, leaving its future uncertain. However, after almost five months after the investment made by Meta, Scale AI CFO Dennis Cinelli has pushed back this speculation. Speaking to CNBC in an interview, Cinelli said that ‘We are a company that signed some of the best deals we have had in the history of our company, just in the last two or three months. We are not a Zombie.”Emphasising on the fact that Scale AI has signed some of its best deals in recent months, Cinelli told CNBC, “We’re not a zombie company,”. Along with this, he also dismissed the claims that the investment made by Meta was a licensing or acquihire deal.He emphasised that Scale AI is still an independent and completely operational.Founded in 2016, ScaleAI is known for its data-labelling services and custom AI applications for governments and enterprises. Cinelli told CNBC that both the divisions of the company are growing with revenue “well into the nine figures.” He also revealed that Scale AI recently secured two major contracts with the US Department of Defense which value $99 million and $100 million in August and September, respectively.Scale AI fired about 14% of its workforce in July, soon after Meta made the investment of $14.3 billion, but the company started the process of hiring and has hired 200 new employees. Along with this, the AI company is also working on expansion and is opening new offices in New York, Washington D.C., St. Louis, and London. Despite alls this, the San Francisco still remains the largest hub of the company where it is occupying 180,000 square feet of former Airbnb space.The departure of Alexandr Wang from the company was considered to a major loss. He was the world’s youngest self-made billionaire until October but Cinelli insists the “vast majority” of employees remain. Facebook-parent Meta now owns 49% stake in ScaleAIwhich is valued around $29 billion, but the company has no voting power or product integration. “Scale’s data business has grown every month since the Meta deal, and its applications business has doubled in the second half of 2025 compared with the first half. Scale expects the applications unit to be the primary revenue driver for the company in the future,” Cenelli told CNBC.",Scale ai cfo pushes back: “we are alive and well” facebook-parent meta made a $14.3 billion investment in ai startup scale ai.

Online job search platform Indeed is reportedly eliminating a very small number of roles, Business Insider reports. The latest job cuts come four months after the company announced to lay off over 100 employees in July earlier this year. The BI report quotes a statement from Indeed where it says “To better align our team structure with business priorities, we've reorganized several functions and made the difficult decision to eliminate a very small number of roles”.However, no details about the roles impacted are known yet.As part of an ongoing restructuring effort by its parent company – Japan’s Recruit Holdings, Indeed has reduced its global workforce to around 11,000 employees. As mentioned above, in July, Indeed and its sister company Glassdoor together laid off about 1,300 employees. The cuts then mainly affected the US-based teams working in research, people operations, and sustainability.In an internal email to staff at the time, Recruit Holdings and Indeed CEO Hisayuki “Deko” Idekoba said, “AI is changing the world” and stressed the need for the company to evolve quickly. “Delivering on this ambition requires us to move faster, try new things, and fix what's broken,” Idekoba wrote. “To achieve our company priorities, it requires creating a structure and culture to support them.”This marks the second round of layoffs at Indeed in two years. In May 2024, the company had already let go of around 1,000 employees, or about 8% of its workforce at the time.","The online job search platform indeed is reportedly eliminating a very small number of roles.

University of Pennsylvania cyber attack: Data worth million exposed





The University of Pennsylvania has confirmed that hackers gained access to several of its internal systems linked to development and alumni activities, stealing confidential data in the process, reports BleepingComputer. The breach, discovered on October 31, occurred after attackers obtained employee credentials through a social engineering scam.""Penn employs a robust information security program; however, access to these systems occurred due to a sophisticated identity impersonation commonly known as social engineering,"" the university said in a statement.The university said its staff quickly locked down the affected systems to stop further intrusions but not before an “offensive and fraudulent email” was sent to members of the Penn community.The university further revealed that it has alerted the FBI and is working with cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike to investigate the incident.According to BleepingComputer’s report, the attackers accessed Penn’s Salesforce donor database, SharePoint files, and other platforms, stealing around 1.71 GB of data. This includes sensitive personal and financial information of alumni and donors such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email IDs, and donation histories.The hackers claimed to have obtained records of roughly 1.2 million donors, including details like “gift histories, wealth ratings, and lifetime commitment amounts.” They also said they sent a mass email to nearly 700,000 people after discovering their access was revoked.The attackers told BleepingComputer that the breach wasn’t politically motivated but aimed at Penn’s “vast, wonderfully wealthy donor database.” However, their communications also included sharp criticism of the university’s diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.The university says it is now strengthening its security systems, conducting staff training on social engineering, and enhancing monitoring tools.Once the probe concludes, Penn plans to notify affected individuals. The university has also urged students, alumni, and donors to stay alert for suspicious emails or phone calls that could be phishing attempts.","University of pennsylvania has confirmed that hackers gained access to several of its internal systems linked to development and alumni activities.

Elon Musk’s $1 trillion pay package

Elon Musk Becomes First Man To Have $500 Billion Wealth





Jack Dorsey, Twitter co-founder and former CEO, has shared a post supporting proposed $1 trillion pay package for Tesla CEO Elon Musk . For those unaware, the EV maker is set to host its annual general meeting (AGM) today, November 6. One of the key agenda of this year’s Tesla AGM is the $1 trillion pay package for Musk which was initially proposed in September this year. Voicing his support, Dorsey wrote in an X post: “.”Jack Dorsey quoted a previous Tesla post dated September 18. It said:.”Elon Musk acknowledged and replied to Jack Dorsey's post with a heart emoji.In September this year, the Tesla board proposed a $1 trillion compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk. The newly proposed award is roughly 18 times the size of the 2018 pay package. At its Novermber 6 annual general meeting, Tesla shareholders approved the pay with a strong majority of 75%.In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) then, the company said that “traditional compensation packages granted to executives at other companies were determined to not be appropriate for designing Mr. Musk’s incentive compensation.”Notably, the new pay package comes with a condition – 10 million active FSD subscriptions for Tesla and 1 million Tesla robotaxis on the road. FSD, as explained in the SEC filing “means an advanced driving system, regardless of the marketing name used, that is capable of performing transportation tasks that provide autonomous or similar functionality under specified driving conditions”.","Twitter co-founder and former ceo jack dorsey has shared a post supporting proposed $1 trillion pay package for tesla ceo elon musk.

SmugAlana’s viral post deepens anger as fans call Twitch “dishonest”





Twitch is facing huge backlash after its apology for the assault on popular streamer Emiru (Emily Schunk) at TwitchCon San Diego. The platform said it “failed to keep Emiru safe” and promised to donate to anti-sexual violence groups. But fans and creators say Twitch is lying, hiding facts, and not taking sexual assault seriously. A viral community note under Twitch’s post claimed the company “lied on several occasions” and even withheld video evidence.Many users also said Twitch let the man who assaulted Emiru walk free. The outrage grew when another streamer, SmugAlana, mocked Twitch online for unbanning a creator accused of sexual assault after only a one-week ban. Fans now accuse Twitch of hypocrisy and protecting wrongdoers. The issue has become a huge PR disaster for the company, with growing calls for CEO Dan Clancy to take real action, or step down.After Twitch’s post on November 7, streamer SmugAlana shared a meme mocking the company. She wrote, “Nobody is taking this seriously after you unbanned a chick who sexually assaulted a dude on stream after 1 week. You ban people for longer for less.”Her post went viral fast, getting thousands of likes and reposts. Many agreed with her, saying Twitch’s punishments seem unfair and confusing.A community note added to Twitch’s apology made things worse. It accused the platform of lying multiple times, not giving full details, and hiding key evidence. Some users said Twitch claimed the attacker was detained, but video proof showed he simply walked away. Others slammed CEO Dan Clancy, saying he was “out partying” while calling Emiru a “friend” online.Fans and creators are now calling for real changes, like stronger event safety, clear rules for bans, and full transparency. Many said Twitch acts fast for small mistakes, but slow and soft when serious issues happen.By November 8, the backlash had spread beyond fans to advertisers and sponsors. Critics say Twitch’s weak response to sexual assault shows “broken priorities.” For many creators, the Emiru case is no longer just one event, it’s a symbol of how Twitch fails to protect its own streamers and ignores serious problems until they go viral.Also Read: YouTuber Candace Owens Fires Back At Ben Shapiro After He Claims She Accused Erika Kirk Of Killing Charlie Kirk","Twitch’s apology for emiru assault sparks backlash, fans accuse platform of lying and ignoring sexual assault.

Australia leads the world in banning social media for children







The Danish government has reached an agreement to implement a minimum age requirement of 15 years old on certain social media platforms, it announced on Friday.The move follows Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen's call for restrictions on children's use of social media in her opening speech to Parliament last month, due to concerns over youth mental health. A majority of parties in parliament said they would support the plan.""As one of the first countries in the EU, Denmark is now taking a groundbreaking step towards introducing age limits on social media,"" said the country's digitalization ministry in a statement. ""This is done to protect children and young people in the digital world.""""As a starting point, children under the age of 15 should not have access to platforms that may expose them to harmful content or harmful features,"" the statement said.The ministry did not specify which social media platforms are affected or how the ban will be enforced.However, exceptions can be made if parents believe their child should have access to social media at an earlier age. According to the statement, parents will have the opportunity to consent to their children's access, if their children are as young as 13.The agreement also envisages allocating 160 million Danish kroner (€21.4 million; $24.8 million) to 14 initiatives aimed at strengthening the protection of children and young people online and creating a better framework for their digital lives.As part of the agreement, EU's Digital Services Act supervision will be strengthened, and funds will be allocated to support the development of alternative social media platforms. Additionally, extra efforts will be made to combat illegal marketing by influencers, the statement mentioned.A coalition of lawmakers ""are making it clear that children should not be left alone in a digital world where harmful content and commercial interests are too much a part of shaping their everyday lives and childhoods,"" the ministry said.""Children and young people have their sleep disrupted, lose their peace and concentration, and experience increasing pressure from digital relationships where adults are not always present,"" it said. ""This is a development that no parent, teacher or educator can stop alone.""""Denmark is now leading the way in Europe with a national age limit for social media and a concerted effort to strengthen the digital wellbeing of children and young people,"" Digitalization Minister Caroline Stage said.""We are taking a necessary stand against a development where large tech platforms have had free rein in children's rooms for far too long.""This Danish plan follows Australia's lead. In December, Australia is set to become the first country to ban social media for children, setting the minimum age at 16.In September, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told a United Nations forum in New York that she was ""inspired"" by Australia's ""common sense"" decision to enact age restrictions.The legislation subjects social media platforms to fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars (€30 million; $32.3 million) for allowing children under 16 to create accounts.On Wednesday, Australia announced that it had added the message board Reddit and the livestreaming service Kick to its list of social media platforms that must prohibit children under 16 from having accounts.These platforms will join Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, and YouTube in facing a world-first legal obligation to shut down accounts belonging to younger Australian children on December 10, according to Communications Minister Anika Wells.","Denmark to introduce minimum age requirement of 15 on certain social media platforms.

Shein sparks outrage over 'childlike' sex doll







Singapore-based online retailer Shein is not to be subject to a ban in France during a probe into the sale of illegal items, France's government announced on Friday.""The government has succeeded in getting Shein to remove all illegal products that were being sold on its platform,"" Paris said in a statement.The French government said that the firm remained ""under close observation by state authorities.""It stressed that legal proceedings initiated against the company are to continue.The government's assessment found that no illegal products such as child pornography, stabbing weapons or certain medicines were being sold on the platform.The company was founded in Nanjing, China, in 2008 and moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2022.The platform caused an uproar in France after it was found to have been advertising ""childlike"" sex dolls. In response, Shein said it had sanctioned the seller and banned the sale of sex dolls on its platform, while also temporarily suspending all third-party listings.France had also called upon the European Union to sanction the retailer over the listing of the dolls.On Wednesday, France's government took steps to ban Shein unless it complies with existing regulations.On the same day, Shein opened its first permanent brick-and-morter shop in Paris' iconic BHV Marais department store, which was met with a petition against the opening that garnered over 120,000 signatures.In a separate probe, the European Union and national consumer authorities are investigating the firm's marketing practices, which they allege are in breach of EU consumer law.Shein has also received criticism from environmental groups over its reliance on fast-fashion.","Singapore-based online retailer shein is not to be subject to a ban in france during a probe into the sale of illegal items.

Social media: Extreme positions and vocal minorities get most attention



EU's Digital Services Act offers glimmer of hope



Finland promotes media literacy from kindergarten







In January 2025, Elon Musk conducted an interview on X with Alice Weidel, the leader of Germany's far-right AfD party, some regional branches of which are considered right-wing extremist by German intelligence services.""Only the AfD can save Germany. End of story,"" he said in an undisguised interference by a powerful social network in Germany's election campaign.In Romania in 2024, the far-right presidential candidate Calin Georgescu won the first round of the elections to the surprise of many: The political outsider had not participated in any TV debates and had not invested any money in his campaign. His success came mainly through the video platform TikTok; his videos were very prominent in the feeds of many Romanians.Suspicions quickly arose that social bots (automated accounts) and trolls (human users who are sometimes paid to act on behalf of a foreign body or government agency) must have been involved. The election was annulled. It is also known that bots and trolls have been used to manipulate public opinion in many other digital discussions and topics, such as Brexit and the COVID-19 pandemic.What happens in the digital sphere can have a huge influence on public opinion.At a conference entitled ""Big Tech and digital democracy: How much regulation does public discourse need?"" organized by DW and the University of Cologne as part of a series of events on Global Media Law, media and constitutional law expert Dieter Dörr stated that ""democracy is under serious threat.""Established and respected media outlets are present on these platforms and use Instagram, YouTube and others as channels for their content. But there are also numerous other players. They don't even have to be bots or trolls: There are many accounts that do not maintain certain standards, andincite hatred against others, spread false claims or use artificial intelligence (AI) to manipulate and generate images and videos.The algorithms used by social media to decide what content is displayed when and shown to whom reward this kind of behavior.""Extreme opinions, which have a wide-reaching scope, are pushed to the top,"" said Dörr, explaining that this is what keeps users on platforms for longer, allowing for more money to be earned from them.Social media platforms have become an important, if not the only, source of information for many people. Politicians and researchers have long recognized that the power wielded by these platforms is a problem. But can anything be done about it?The European Union (EU) has stepped up efforts in recent years to regulate the digital world, primarily through its Digital Services Act (DSA), which came into force in February 2024. It requires major online platforms and search engines such as Amazon, Google, X and Facebook to provide greater transparency and protection for users.Renate Nikolay, the deputy director-general of the Directorate-General for Communications Networks, Content and Technology (DG CONNECT) at the European Commission, which is responsible for enforcing the Digital Services Act, says: ""We are pursuing three principles: First, platforms must assess and minimize systemic risks. Second, we are strengthening users' rights, for example by providing complaint mechanisms. Third, we demand transparency in algorithms and require platforms to give researchers access to their data.""This sounds like a big step forward: Platforms have to provide information on their algorithms and even offer users the option to disable personalized content or advertising. After all, algorithms tend not only to disadvantage moderate and differentiated content. Ultimately, they also create filter bubbles or echo chambers, in which users are mainly surrounded by content and other users that reflect their own views. This puts them at risk of falling into a spiral of radicalization.The TikTok algorithm is particularly notorious. A recent study by the University of Potsdam and the Bertelsmann Foundation showed that during the last German election campaign, political parties were not equally visible in the TikTok feeds of young users. Videos from official party accounts on the political fringes, especially the AfD, were played more frequently than those from the accounts of more centrist parties.During the period under review, the AfD uploaded 21.5% percent of all the videos, but these accounted for 37.4% of videos that appeared in feeds. The AfD's videos were therefore overrepresented. For its part, the center-right CDU/CSU party of Chancellor Friedrich Merz uploaded 17.1% of all party videos, but these accounted for only 4.9% of videos in feeds.When asked about this at the conference, Tim Klaws, Director of Government Relations and Public Policy for DACH, Israel and BeNeLux at TikTok, gave an evasive answer. He said that digital platforms had no interest in operating in an environment full of disinformation and populism, and were trying to minimize ""fake news"", hate speech, etc. with the help of AI and their staff members.Incidentally, apart from the DSA, there are other laws that regulate digital platforms, such as the European Media Freedom Act, which supplements the first by granting special status to recognized media outlets on large platforms — so that their content is treated transparently and cannot be removed without good reason.Something else that experts say is important besides regulation: media literacy. People need to understand digital media better and use them more responsibly. Ultimately, users are the ones who post, consume, share and comment on content.""Finland is exemplary in this regard, and we can learn something from them,"" says Nikolay.Indeed, Finland has put in place a national strategy to promote media literacy, which starts as early as kindergarten and has resulted in Finns being very good at critically examining content and recognizing disinformation.Only a combination of all the available measures can combat social media influence and online manipulation. But some experts such as Dörr remain skeptical: ""There's not much that can be done against this tsunami."" Particularly considering the fact that new challenges are constantly emerging, such as AI chatbots that provide false or biased information.At the end of the DW conference, Nikolay made it clear that Europe was not ""against the platforms,"" but wanted to work with them to ""change business models so that they promote democracy rather than endanger it.""She said that one example of good cooperation was this year's parliamentary elections in Moldova. In the run-up to the polls, EU representatives, the Moldovan authorities, civil society actors and the operators of platforms such as Google, Meta, and TikTok had sat down together to counter disinformation and protect the electoral process.This was apparently successful: A Russian disinformation campaign against the pro-European ruling Party of Action and Solidarity (PAS) did not have a decisive impact on the election results. PAS emerged as the election winner.","Social media platforms have become an important, if not the only, source of information for many people.

Social media reactions:





A post-heist security audit has revealed shocking details about the Louvre’s cybersecurity, revealing that the password protecting France’s most famous museum’s video surveillance system was simply “LOUVRE. ”French newspaper Libération first reported the revelation.The revelations come weeks after the daring October 18 heist, in which thieves made off with crown jewels worth $102 million (£76 million) from the Galerie d’Apollon in broad daylight in a few minutes. The robbers entered via a balcony using a stolen mechanical lift, smashed display cases, and escaped.The findings about the security system are part of a wider trove of documents from the French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI), which has been auditing the museum’s systems for more than a decade.In a 2014 review, ANSSI warned that the Louvre’s IT systems that are responsible for alarms, access control, and video surveillance were dangerously vulnerable. “An attacker who manages to take control of it would be able to facilitate damage or even theft of artworks,” the report said.Cybersecurity advisor Javvad Malik of software firm KnowBe4 described the museum’s defences as “shockingly simplistic.” He told the Daily Mail, “The museum's video surveillance systems were protected by shockingly simplistic passwords.Whether this weakness played a role in the heist is still under review. But the lesson is clear. When systems safeguarding priceless cultural treasures rely on guessable credentials, it's not a policy gap – it is an invitation, serving as an indicator that the overall culture of security may be weak. ”Adding to the embarrassment, the report found the museum was still using outdated versions of Windows, which experts say is equivalent to “leaving your front door unlocked.” Later reviews, including those as recent as 2025, suggested the Louvre continued to suffer from major cybersecurity flaws.Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau told Franceinfo radio that the suspects were likely “petty criminals rather than professional members of an organised crime group.”The French daylight heist has since resulted in the endless ridicule of the Louvre across social media, including from billionaire CEO Elon Musk.","The password protecting the louvre's video surveillance system was simply “louvre. ” french newspaper libération first reported the revelation.

Sulfur Cave spiders thrive in a unique Sulfur-powered ecosystem





In an astonishing discovery, scientists have found what is believed to be the world’s largest spiderweb inside Sulfur Cave, a dark and narrow passage located on the border between Greece and Albania. This extraordinary web, sprawling over a massive 106 square meters (1,140 square feet), is home to an estimated 111,000 spiders living together in an unprecedented colonial network.The web, first discovered by cavers from the Czech Speleological Society during a 2022 expedition in Vromoner Canyon, is a remarkable patchwork of thousands of individual funnel-shaped webs clinging to the cave walls. A team of researchers led by István Urák from the Sapientia Hungarian University of Transylvania in Romania visited the cave in 2024 to study this extraordinary arachnid colony.The colony comprises two dominant species: about 69,000 individuals of Tegenaria domestica, commonly known as the barn funnel weaver or domestic house spider, alongside more than 42,000 Prinerigone vagans, a type of sheet weaver spider. This is the first documented instance of these two common species exhibiting cooperative colonial behavior instead of their usual solitary or predatory interactions.According to the researchers, the absence of light within Sulfur Cave appears to have altered normal spider behaviors, potentially disrupting predatory instincts and allowing these species to coexist in such high densities.The cave environment is uniquely sustained by a sulfur-rich stream flowing through the cavern, producing hydrogen sulfide that supports a sulfur-based microbial biofilm ecosystem.The spiders’ primary diet consists of non-biting midges, which feed on these microbial films, creating a fascinating sulfur-driven food web that sustains the massive spider colony. This cave ecosystem is unlike any other, as molecular and gut content analyses reveal that the cave-dwelling spiders have genetically diverged from their surface relatives and possess less diverse microbiomes due to their sulphur-based diet.The cave is also a hotspot for reproduction, with female house spiders known to lay six to eight egg sacs every 20 to 25 days, each containing up to 100 eggs in the first cocoon, followed by smaller successive clutches. The density of the webs makes it impossible to count all the egg sacs precisely.“The moment of discovery inspired admiration, respect, and gratitude,” said lead author Urák, emphasizing the uniqueness and ecological importance of this find. The research team is now preparing for further studies to better understand the web’s ecology and the adaptations of its arachnid inhabitants. Conservation of this site remains a priority, given its fragile and isolated nature.This groundbreaking discovery sheds light on how species adapt within extreme environments and reveals a hidden biodiversity hotspot demonstrating remarkable biological cooperation and survival.","Scientists have found what is believed to be the world’s largest spiderweb inside sulfur cave, a dark and narrow passage located on the border between greece and albania.
