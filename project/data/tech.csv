"Chennai Tax Evasion: IT dept detects more than Rs 1,000 crore tax evasion during searches on private company premises in Chennai",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/it-dept-detects-more-than-rs-1000-crore-tax-evasion-during-searches-on-private-company-premises-in-chennai/articleshow/125916549.cms,"CHENNAI: The income tax department uncovered more than Rs 1,000 crore in tax evasion and detected a Rs 250crore unexplained investment in a Switzerland-based pharma company during ongoing search operations on the premises of Refex Group and its associates, the department said in a statement on Thursday.The investigation directorate, income tax department, Chennai, launched the searches on Tuesday, covering Refex Industries Ltd — the group’s flagship firm engaged in refrigerant gases, ash handling, power trading, and solar power — as well as financiers, hawala operators, and jewellery businesses linked to the promoters.Officials said the searches had exposed Rs 1,112 crore in bogus purchases, largely tied to coal procurement and ash-handling contracts. They also found that Refex Industries received Rs 382.68 crore in equity contributions from 53 individuals and entities, including 15 non-filers and 37 who failed to disclose the transactions in their tax returns. Many of the contributors are employees or associates of the promoters, raising suspicion that the entire investment is unexplained money routed through benami entities.Documents seized during the search showed the group’s US$30 million investment in Swiss pharma firm Astro Viz, the source of which is now being probed. Investigators also flagged Rs 115 crore invested in DN Energy Ltd, which was allegedly diverted immediately after creditThe department further found that the promoter created shell companies in the name of his driver, through which Rs 8.5 crore in cash deposits and over Rs 200 crore in transactions were routed.Officials said he also spent heavily on a Rs 37 crore private jet, Rs 10 crore in luxury cars, and Rs 4 crore in high-end watches.In parallel action, searches were conducted on financier Rajesh Surana, who reportedly advanced Rs 312 crore to Aradhya Infra, which then loaned the funds onward. The role of hawala operators who helped channel more than Rs 10 crore through illegal non-banking routes is also being examined.So far, the department detected over Rs 1,000 crore in unaccounted income and recovered Rs 70 crore in unaccounted cash, gold, and silver. Further investigation is ongoing.“The search and related processes initiated by the authorities are currently under way, and Refex Group, along with all its subsidiaries and employees, is fully cooperating with the officials to ensure a smooth and transparent completion of the procedure. Our business operations continue as usual,” the company said in statement on Thursday.“Refex Group has always operated with a strong commitment to legal compliance, ethical conduct and regulatory transparency, and will continue to do so. We request all stakeholders and the public at large to avoid spreading and/or relying on any speculative unauthenticated information’s unless the same are officially verified information(s)released by the competent authorities,” it said.","Income tax department uncovered more than rs 1,000 crore in tax evasion and detected a rs 250crore unexplained investment in a switzerland-based pharma company.

What AI can do: a short practical guide



The ethical and regulatory fault lines



The strategist is no longer human

NEW DELHI: For a decade, Prashant Kishor has been India’s undisputed master craftsman of elections, the strategist who could bend narratives, stitch coalitions and turn sentiment into seats to deliver wins for major politicians. The 2025 Bihar assembly polls, however, delivered a jolt: Kishor, despite months of padyatras, booth-level outreach and the full weight of Jan Suraaj, failed to win a single seat.The upset was more than a personal setback. It signalled a shift already unfolding beneath the surface: the old era of political strategy, built on instinct, experience and human networks, is being steadily eclipsed by a new actor that never tires, never forgets and never stops optimising.The 2020s have introduced a political strategist unlike any before: Artificial Intelligence (AI).Always awake, endlessly scalable and capable of producing personalised persuasion at a fraction of the cost of a conventional campaign team. By 2025, influence is no longer crafted by professionals in war rooms; it is engineered by algorithms fine-tuned to voters’ moods in real-time.The story is no longer only about deepfakes. This is no longer simply about mimicking politicians or reviving long-deceased icons of a political past.The larger threat and opportunity lie in AI’s capacity for persuasion.Studies published this year show that AI chatbots can shift voting attitudes at rates far higher than traditional advertising. Politicians once needed speeches, rallies and media placements to move the needle. In 2024, a ten-message exchange with a chatbot has been shown to deliver greater impact than a multimillion-dollar television campaign.Artificial intelligence has crept into election campaigns around the world, not as a novelty but as a tool for influence. In the 2024 Lok Sabha elections, political parties harnessed generative AI to navigate the country’s linguistic diversity, translating speeches into regional languages and producing personalised outreach that addressed local audiences.AI tools also created images, videos and voice clips that were widely shared on social media and messaging apps, blurring the line between genuine and fake political content.In the United States, AI was used less for resurrecting figures than for shaping narratives. Advanced models generated millions of messages, memes and automated responses designed to appeal to specific voter groups, turning broad campaigning into hyper-targeted persuasion.MIT researchers have documented how AI can produce and test myriad versions of political content, learning over time which messages resonate most.What makes the current wave of AI so powerful isn’t just its reach, but its precision. Campaign tech can tailor content not just for broad demographics, but for specific segments — and increasingly, for individuals.Using voter data and language models, parties can now generate personalised videos, voice messages or WhatsApp clips that address voters by name or reference hyper-local issues. In India’s 2024 elections, some campaigns reportedly used AI to send personalised campaign messages to local volunteers or voters with voice-cloned content that sounded like a regional leader speaking directly to them.Here’s an example: below are two images placed side by side — one is real, and the other has been altered using AI. Can you tell which is which?If you’re comfortable with tech, the “obvious” choice might be the right-hand image as the AI-generated one. But in a world already overwhelmed with information and shrinking attention spans, it’s easy for many people to be misled.Not long ago, creating such an edit with traditional software would have taken hours of careful work. Now, AI can produce it in minutes with nothing more than a simple prompt.India’s size, linguistic diversity and enormous WhatsApp economy made it a live laboratory for election-grade AI. During the 2024 Lok Sabha campaign, parties experimented with voice clones, personalised videos and hyper-local ads that would once have required expensive local teams. Media reporting found that synthetic videos and voice cloning were deployed to reach voters in their own languages and dialects, sometimes resurrecting familiar faces to prompt nostalgia or loyalty. Deepfakes of late leaders such as M Karunanidhi and audio clones of Jayalalithaa circulated in campaign pockets and on WhatsApp.The 2025 Delhi election cycle illustrated the same duality of benefit and risk. Parties used AI to create slick creatives and chatbots that answered voters’ queries about municipal schemes and polling logistics.Rival campaigns, meanwhile, weaponised visuals and memes that many AI produced to caricature opponents and to amplify outrage on social platforms.Bihar showed how regulators and institutions had to catch up. Ahead of state polls, authorities moved to require labels and disclosures for AI content and warned parties about misuse. The Election Commission issued advisories asking parties to identify AI-created or digitally enhanced material and to remove misleading content promptly. That reflected mounting official concern that unlabelled synthetic media could distort voters’ understanding of where, when and how to vote.In Tamil Nadu politics, AI influence crossed into theatrical territory. Actor-politician Vijay’s party, Tamizhaga Vetri Kazhagam (TVK), released an AI-generated video showing CN Annadurai the iconic founder of rival DMK , appearing to endorse Vijay’s leadership over MK Stalin . The synthetic content drew widespread attention for its audacity and emotional appeal, using the late leader’s likeness and voice patterns in a campaign context.AI platforms can be combined into simple, high-impact campaign stacks.Real-time translation and localisation: Tools such as the Indian government’s Bhashini are already being used to translate speeches in real time and reach multilingual audiences in a single event. That makes national figures intelligible across linguistic divides.Personalised media: AI can insert a person’s name into a video or voice message, speak in a local dialect, and reference a local scheme to create the feel of a one-to-one conversation.Chatbots and P2P messaging: Campaign chatbots on messaging apps can answer voter queries, persuade undecided voters and provide step-by-step voting information. Early field trials suggest conversational bots can move turnout modestly when used responsibly.Synthetic resurrection: Voice cloning and face generation can create speeches and visuals of public figures, living or deceased. This can be used for commemorations or to amplify nostalgia, but it also creates a potent vector for deception.Micro-testing at scale: AI enables the automated generation of hundreds of message permutations and near-instant A/B testing to identify what language or framing works for which segment.The promise of AI for civic inclusion is real. Translation and simplification can make policy accessible. Chatbots can help elderly or remote voters get polling details. Yet the same features that improve outreach also enable deception at scale. The question facing democracies is not whether to use AI but how to shape rules and infrastructure so the technology empowers voters and not predators.Regulatory responses are emerging. The EC has moved to require prominent labelling of synthetic material and to instruct parties to maintain records of AI-created campaign content. Platforms have experimented with provenance labels and ad disclosure rules. At the technical level, researchers and agencies push watermarking, provenance metadata and detection tools.The lesson from recent elections is clear: AI hasn’t stolen votes, but it has quietly entered the game, learning fast and growing harder to contain with every cycle. Its impact depends on public awareness, transparency, and ethical use.Campaigns have always combined messaging, persuasion, and spectacle. AI doesn’t change politics; it accelerates it, sharpens it, and scales it beyond human limits. Just as TV reshaped image and social media reshaped attention, AI is reshaping trust.The strategist is no longer only human. That voice in your phone, that video in your feed, even that argument that swayed you, it may never have come from a person at all.","Artificial intelligence has crept into election campaigns around the world, not as a novelty but as a tool for influence.

New window for coal linkage auctions to give push to reforms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/new-window-for-coal-linkage-auctions-to-give-push-to-reforms/articleshow/125940430.cms,"India has launched CoalSETU, a new policy for long-term coal linkage auctions aimed at industrial use and exports. This dedicated window allows any domestic industrial buyer to bid, simplifying procedures and boosting the utilization of coal reserves. Fuel supply agreements can extend up to 15 years, with flexible use within group companies, potentially reducing imports and creating export opportunities.

NEW DELHI: In a fresh push to reform coal sector, Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs Friday approved a CoalSETU policy, a dedicated window for long-term auction of coal linkages for industrial use and exports.The new CoalSETU window - Policy for Auction of Coal Linkage for Seamless, Efficient and Transparent Utilisation - will be added to the existing 2016 linkage auction policy for the non-regulated sector. Unlike current system, where coal linkages are auctioned only to specified end users such as cement, steel, sponge iron and aluminium plants, the new window will allow any domestic industrial buyer to bid for coal linkages. Coking coal will not be offered, and traders will be barred to prevent market distortion.Officials said the move aims at simplifying procedures, boosting ease of doing business and ensuring faster utilisation of India's coal reserves at a time when the country is working to cut dependence on imports. It also aligns with the wider opening of the coal sector for commercial mining, where end-use restrictions had already been removed.Existing linkage auctions for specified sectors will continue, but these industries may join the new window. Fuel supply agreements can be signed for up to 15 years, and flexible use of coal linkages within group companies has been allowed.Commercial mining of coal, launched in 2020, has improved domestic availability. India crossed milestone of one billion tonnes of coal production in a year for the first time in 2024-25.Under the policy, coal obtained through this window can be used for own consumption, export (up to 50% of quantity), coal washing or by group companies. Resale within the country will not be allowed. The govt expects the policy to encourage more washed coal production, reduce imports and create export opportunities.","India has launched coalsetu, a new policy for long-term coal linkage auctions aimed at industrial use and exports.

Who wins the couple net worth battle between Brittany Mahomes & Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce & Taylor Swift

Money talk never seems to stop around NFL couples, and it gets even louder when the Mahomes name enters the chat. People follow Patrick and Brittany everywhere these days, partly for the football and partly for the world they have built around it. Their success shows up in many corners, and because of that, fans want to know what their earnings look like as a team. The numbers for 2025 reveal a clearer picture than usual, and it gives people something new to discuss.Then comes the shift whenever Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift appear in the same conversation. Their world feels bigger, louder and sometimes impossible to compare with anyone else in sports. They shape trends without trying, and their names stay at the top of every list. Naturally, people want to know who stands higher in net worth and how far apart the numbers really are.Forbes places Patrick Mahomes at $78 million, a figure built from years of consistent play, big endorsements and a contract that only grows in value. Brittany Mahomes, who has created her own presence in the fitness and media space, holds a net worth of $15 million, according to Forbes. Together, the couple sits at $93 million, which is strong by any measure.Their earnings come from different directions, and that is part of what keeps people watching. Patrick’s value rises with every big game or new partnership, while Brittany continues to grow her own identity through business work and public engagement. It is a number that reflects steady movement rather than sudden jumps.Taylor Swift makes this comparison almost unfair. Forbes lists her at $1.6 billion, a number built on tours that break records, music that rarely leaves the charts and a business mind that keeps expanding her reach. Travis Kelce networth, according to Forbes in 2025 is $70 million, from his NFL career, endorsements and a growing presence in entertainment.Together, they reach $1.67 billion, a total that feels far beyond anything the sports world usually talks about. Their earnings come from two massive industries, and the difference shows immediately.The comparison does not take long to settle. The Mahomes couple holds $93 million, which is impressive and still rising. But Kelce and Swift stand on a completely different level with $1.67 billion. So if anyone wants to know who wins the net worth battle, the answer is clear. Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce take the lead by a wide margin.Also read: Brittany Mahomes abruptly goes silent after Mahomes and Kelce’s meltdown shakes Chiefs’ season","Forbes places patrick mahomes at $78 million, a figure built from years of consistent play and big endorsements.

How Triple H and Stephanie McMahon accumulated long-term financial strength through wrestling, leadership and corporate expansion

Why their legacy still guides WWE’s future identity

As members of the WWE corporate leadership team and creative team members, Triple H and Stephanie McMahon are important to both the WWE corporate and creative ecosystems. The estimated net worth of Triple H is approximately $250 million, while the estimated net worth of Stephanie McMahon is approximately $250 million.Therefore, the combined estimated value of both Triple H and Stephanie McMahon in 2025 will be approximately $500 million based on the long-term growth of their respective equity interests, as well as the decades they have each spent with WWE.Triple H’s career rarely moved in a straight line, because his shift from performer to executive created a layered income structure through royalties, contract earnings and high-ranking corporate roles. His long involvement in creative planning continues to generate value as global media rights expand and the talent pipelines he built remain central to WWE’s structure.Stephanie McMahon followed a different path, leading branding initiatives, community programmes and global partnerships while earning multi-million-dollar compensation packages across several executive cycles. WWE's merger with Endeavor has provided additional value for its shareholdings as a result of increased activity in the marketplace and the evolution of entertainment entities to include more entertainment-based revenue streams.Due to this growth, WWE and Endeavor's financial momentum have developed over time as a result of the company being able to create global brands and have a consistent presence in the evolution of WWE from within its Entertainment Model.Through WWE Television and Digital showcases, Triple H's fingerprints remain very evident. Many of the strategies that he created while heading up NXT are still being utilized in the creation of talent presentation, match structure, and long-term development of characters for the roster of talent on the main roster.The vision of talent recruitment created by Stephanie McMahon will shape the future stories of multiple main event talents, providing WWE with a solid foundation for character development and storytelling. The previous work of Stephanie McMahon will continue to strengthen WWE's public image and brand as a result of the partnerships, digital initiatives and outreach programs she helped create before transitioning out of day-to-day responsibilities.The combination of Triple H and Stephanie McMahon is now being viewed as a creative foundation and business guideline for the future growth of WWE under TKO and the ongoing economic security that both Stephanie McMahon and Triple H represent.Also Read: WWE in big trouble?

On December 10, Jon Rhoades of The Big Ten Huddle shared a swirl of rumors, much of it traced back to Justin Spiro (Host of “The Spiro Avenue Show”), who first broke news about former head coach Sherrone Moore. Spiro had been hinting since mid-August, even before the season began, that Moore could face serious trouble or even be fired by the University of Michigan. After the Ohio State game, Spiro predicted Moore’s dismissal could come within a week or as late as two months.The heart of the rumor is that Moore was fired due to an alleged relationship with Paige Shiver, his executive assistant, who was promoted when Moore took over for Jim Harbaugh. Now, the latest twist claims Shiver is pregnant and that Moore is confirmed as the father. Paige Shiver’s news has sent shock waves through cyberspace. But Shiver’s ties to football run deeper than college sidelines. She is the daughter of Jeff Shiver, a respected NFL scout. To understand her father’s story, let’s revisit Dan Pompei’s 2019 biographical interview in The Athletic.On a spring day in 1987, Jeff Shiver was flipping a hamburger in his Lafayette, Indiana, kitchen when the phone rang with a call that would change his life.Bill Tobin, the Chicago Bears’ personnel chief, was on the line, offering Shiver a chance to join the NFL’s scouting ranks. At the time, Shiver was earning $18,000 a year as a BLESTO scout, but Tobin’s offer of $25,000 felt like striking gold. Shiver eagerly accepted, feeling as if he had just won the lottery.As they sealed the deal with a handshake, Tobin promised, “You’re going to be with the Bears a long time.” More than three decades later, Shiver is still a fixture in Chicago, outlasting every other personnel man in the team’s hundred-year history. Only Scott DiStefano has served (five years) longer as a continuously employed NFL scout for the Denver Broncos. From fullback Brad Muster in 1988 to running back David Montgomery in 2019, Shiver has played a role in every Bears draft pick.“Jeff worked out even better than I thought,” Tobin said via The Athletic in 2019. “He’s a wonderful person and damn good scout. He’s been a giant in the scouting industry.”“I think the world of him,” said former Bears general manager Jerry Angelo. “I don’t know of anybody more respected and or revered in the scouting business than Jeff. I saw it from afar when I was with other teams, and I saw it firsthand when I got to Chicago. Whatever he says, you can take it to the bank.”Shiver credits his impeccable endurance to his faith and to Laura, his wife of 34 years (at the time of the 2019 The Athletic interview, now they’ve been together for roughly 40 long years). “It’s a hard job,” Shiver said. “To be able to do it begins with a great wife. Not once did I walk in the front door and hear her complain about me not being there.”Laura’s patience is all the more monumental given that Shiver spends up to 275 nights a year away from home, crisscrossing the country in his Ford Edge and tallying about 30,000 miles annually. Life on the road has brought him moments of pure bliss, like hearing, “Honey, I think I’m pregnant,” and heartache, like learning, “Your brother-in-law was in a car accident, and he didn’t make it.” His fondest travel memories are the late-night phone calls from his young children, Brittany, John, Paige, and Nicole, soft voices asking, “Dad, when are you coming home?”The former Bears general manager, Ryan Pace, told The Athletic in 2019 that Shiver’s experience on the staff is invaluable. Think about the relationships he’s built and the resources he has. He can call people and get information that a younger scout can’t. He also has a mental library of players.In a draft meeting, he’ll quickly point out when one player reminds him of another and explain why. Sometimes, he’ll mention players from way back that nobody else remembers. David Montgomery reminds Shiver a bit of Matt Forte. He does a great job of describing players. He has a million one-liners that make everyone laugh. He brings passion and energy while keeping things fun.Rod Graves, the former Bears personnel director, told The Athletic in 2019 that he always relied on Jeff for core evaluation. He would be shocked if Ryan (Pace) and those who followed did not lean on Jeff in the same way. Shiver was the definition of dependability, an astute evaluator, and someone Graves trusted without a doubt. Few people ranked higher on his list, both as friends and as professionals. Graves has only praise for Shiver and says with complete honesty that he loves the man.Dan Pompei of The Athletic revealed in 2019 that one of the earliest and most profound lessons Shiver absorbed as an NFL scout was to appreciate everyone he encountered, not just those with influence or something to offer. He made it a point to value the everyday people: the gas station attendant, the custodian, the security guard. Shiver’s philosophy was simple: the mission never outweighs the people you meet along the way: “The mission never is greater than the people you come in contact with. ”Pompei also painted a picture of Shiver’s upbringing, shaped by his late parents, John and Myrtle. Jeff inherited his strong work ethic from his father, who spent over 80 years as an auto mechanic at Shiver’s Auto Service, often working twelve-hour days, six days a week. During World War II, John served as a flight engineer and gunner in the Army Air Corps. Meanwhile, Myrtle managed the books and cared for Jeff and his two sisters.Talking to Pompei in 2019, Jeff said he still feels his mother’s love when he bakes her Sour Cream Pound Cake. And when the call came that brought him to the Bears’ front office, he was in the middle of cooking a hamburger. Distracted by the life-changing news, he burned it, but as he told Pompei, it was still the best burger he ever tasted: “By far, the best burger I ever tasted.”Jeff Shiver currently serves as Executive Scout for the Chicago Bears. Since 1987, Shiver has been a staunch presence with the Bears. His decades of commitment were commemorated in February 2020, when he received the first-ever C.O. Brocato Award for Distinguished Service to Scouting. This prestigious honor pays tribute to a legendary scout who dedicated four decades to the Houston Oilers, now known as the Tennessee Titans, and inspired countless others in the profession. ""It's such an honor, it's beyond belief,"" Shiver said in his acceptance speech at the Indiana Convention Center.",Jeff shiver has been with the chicago bears for more than three decades. He has played a role in every bears draft pick since 1988. Shiver credits his impeccable endurance to his faith and to his wife of 34 years. Jeff shiver has been with the chicago bears since 1987.

How Jalen Hurts turned a second-round pick into a $50 million fortune

Jalen Hurts’ contract and endorsements keep his net worth climbing

Rookie deal: four years, $6,025,171

Extension: five years, $255 million

Bry Burrows’ IBM salary and low profile add another $4-6 million

Bry Burrows is not the richest NFL WAG, but she holds real money next to Jalen Hurts

Jalen Hurts is not just carrying the Philadelphia Eagles. He is also one half of a money-heavy, very intentional power couple. With Hurts’ net worth sitting at about $50 million and Bry Burrows’ wealth estimated between $4 million and $6 million, the two are working with a combined financial range of roughly $54 million to $56 million, based on recent public estimates from Celebrity Net Worth and Times of India.On one side you have a Super Bowl-winning quarterback with a record-setting contract and a long endorsement list. On the other, an IBM artificial intelligence partner who earns seven figures on her own terms and wants nothing to do with the “loud NFL WAG” template. Together, they are building a money and status profile that looks very different from the usual quarterback-influencer pairing.Hurts’ money starts with the part everyone sees: his rise from a second-round pick to one of the highest-paid quarterbacks in football. The Philadelphia Eagles took him 53rd overall in the 2020 NFL Draft, at a time when Carson Wentz was still in the building and Hurts looked like a backup plan more than a franchise face.His rookie contract reflected that status. Hurts signed a four-year deal worth just over $6 million, including a $1.9 million signing bonus and $2.8 million guaranteed. His base salaries in those first seasons were modest for a starting quarterback: $610,000 in 2020, $883,000 in 2021, and $1 million in 2022.He was still one of the cheaper starting quarterbacks in the league when he led the Eagles to a Super Bowl appearance after the 2022 season.That run changed everything. Hurts played his way into franchise-quarterback money and cashed it in. In April 2023, he agreed to a five-year extension worth $255 million with Philadelphia. The deal, which started with the 2024 season, briefly set the standard for quarterback contracts and came with $180 million fully guaranteed and an average annual value of $50 million.A detailed breakdown from Teddy Ricketson shows how front-loaded and cap-managed the deal is, with a small base salary and bigger cap hits pushed into future years through void years that run through 2032. In 2024, Hurts’ base salary is just over $1.1 million with a cap hit of about $13.5 million. That cap number climbs above $21 million in 2025 and continues to rise into the 2030s even after the main years of the deal end, thanks to the Eagles spreading out the financial hit.On the field, Hurts has matched that investment. He took the Eagles to a Super Bowl in the 2022 season, earned Pro Bowl and second-team All-Pro honors in 2022, and then helped deliver the franchise’s second Super Bowl win with a victory over the Kansas City Chiefs on Feb. 9, 2025. The résumé is now tracking with the money.Off the field, the numbers are just as aggressive. As of February 2025, Celebrity Net Worth estimates Hurts’ net worth at $50 million. That figure includes his NFL earnings and a growing endorsement portfolio that already looks like a veteran quarterback’s list.Hurts’ deal with the Eagles is the backbone of his net worth, but his off-field work is built to match it. Ricketson’s breakdown lists his total NFL money across two contracts:On top of that, Hurts is already pulling in a long list of sponsorships. He has worked with Columbia Sportswear, EastBay, Gillette, Hulu, Jordan Brand, Kellogg, Keurig, Lemon Perfect, Lincoln Financial Group, Oakley, Pepsi, and Sprite. Those are not fringe brands. They are household companies tying themselves to his image at a relatively early stage of his prime.What makes Hurts stand out in this space is how he has set up the people around him. He works with an all-female management group that runs his football business, marketing, PR, and media.His agent, Nicole Lynn, is the most visible face of that structure. She graduated from Oklahoma’s College of Law in 2015 and built her reputation by becoming the first Black female agent to represent a first-round pick when the New York Jets drafted Quinnen Williams in 2019. Speaking to Glamour in 2019, she said, “It’s such an uphill battle to be a sports agent in general, and more difficult being a woman, and I would say two times as difficult being a Black woman and under the age of 30. I never really listened to the noise — and there was a lot of it. I think that is one of the reasons I am where I am.”Lynn reached out to Hurts in his college days and pitched herself bluntly. Hurts told Sports Illustrated, “I saw that same fire in Nicole. She said, ‘I’m a woman. People are going to overlook me. People are going to doubt me. They’re not going to give me the due respect. But I’m overcoming it, just like you do.’ And that’s where we really hit it off. We had the same vision.”Lynn later became President of Football at Klutch Sports Group in 2023. Around her, Hurts’ team includes Chantal Roman for media relations, Shakeemah Simmons-Winter for PR, Rachel Everett for marketing, and Jenna Malphrus for management. Hurts has talked publicly about being intentional in hiring women and backing women in sports and business.So his half of the couple’s net worth is not just big. It is structured. Long-term money, spread-out cap hits, steady endorsements, and a management team that looks built for a lengthy run rather than a quick cash grab.Bryonna Rivera “Bry” Burrows is not living off Hurts’ contract. Times of India reports that her personal net worth sits between $4 million and $6 million, driven by her work as an artificial intelligence partner at IBM. That range alone would put her ahead of many NFL players who never land a second contract.Bry’s career is old-fashioned corporate grind, not reality TV. According to that same reporting, she has worked her way up inside IBM as a senior client experience consultant, sales executive, and software financing leader before stepping into her current AI partner role. Her job focuses on helping clients use AI to change how they operate, cut costs, and open new lines of business.The money attached to that kind of position lines up with her net worth range. She has not disclosed side businesses or public endorsement deals, even though she could easily leverage her connection to an NFL star. That choice is the point. Burrows has kept her income streams focused on actual work instead of leaning into NIL-style branding.The same profile shows how she and Hurts fit together. They met at the University of Alabama, where Hurts began his college career. Burrows graduated from Alabama as well. The two stayed connected as his football journey moved from Alabama to Oklahoma and then to the NFL. Times of India notes they got engaged in September 2024, and she is now regularly seen supporting him at major events, including his Super Bowl win against the Chiefs.On social media, she is present without being loud. She has an Instagram account, @brys.ig, but has kept a far lower profile than many other partners of star quarterbacks. That is a choice, not a lack of leverage.The easy narrative here would be to label Burrows the richest NFL WAG. The numbers do not support that. Times of India is clear: her $4-6 million net worth does not lead the pack.The same breakdown points to Brittany Mahomes, who sits in the $10-15 million range according to outlets like Marca and StyleCaster. Brittany’s money comes from owning Brittany Lynne Fitness, co-owning the Kansas City Current, and using a large Instagram platform to pull in brand deals with companies such as Alani Nu and Shop Vitality. That is a different lane entirely.Burrows is not trying to beat that lane. Her income is corporate, her social media is controlled, and her visibility is selective. Even so, a $4-6 million net worth while working as an AI partner at a major tech company puts her in rare space compared to most people, including many athletes’ partners.Put that next to Hurts’ $50 million net worth, and the couple is sitting on combined wealth in the mid-eight figures, all before Hurts’ current contract and Burrows’ tech career have fully played out.","Jalen hurts is one half of a money-heavy, very intentional power couple with fiancée bry burrows.

TCS HR chief Sudeep Kunnumal on layoffs in future





Maharashtra labour minister Aakash Fundkar has now informed that the state legislative council that around 376 employees of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) were laid off at the company’s Pune campuses over the past two quarters of the current fiscal year. The disclosure was made via a hand written reply during the Vidhan Parishad session, after concerns were raised by members over reports of widespread layoffs in the IT sector.Fundkar further clarified that the layoffs were not linked to artificial intelligence or automation, addressing speculation that job losses were part of a broader restructuring driven by new technologies. In the Vidhan Parishad, Fundkar revealed that the company fired 376 employees from its Pune campus and the round of layoffs mainly impacted middle and senior-level managers.As reported by new agency PTI, during the Question Hour, the legislators including Uma Khare and Prasad Lad raised questions about increasing job losses in the technology sector and the impact of AI adoption on employment. The reply by the minister is sought to provide transparency by citing official data received directly from TCS.The Maharashtra government also stressed in the fact that while the layoffs have occurred, they are not on the scale suggested by media reports of mass layoffs across multiple cities.The minister further assured the council that the government is monitoring developments in the IT sector closely, given its importance to employment and state’s economy.Recently, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) HR head Sudeep Kunnumal recently addressed concerns over potential layoffs at the IT giant. Speaking during the company’s Q2 earnings call earlier this month, Kunnumal said that TCS is not “chasing a target” when it comes to job cuts. Instead, the IT firm said it will evaluate “everyone”.During the earnings call, analyst Surendra Goyal from Citi asked: “The (second) question is with the release of 1% workforce, the headcount declined by 20,000 people or 3%. And what you had announced earlier was 2%. So should we expect a similar kind of head count reduction in the next quarter as well?”TCS HR head Sudeep Kunnumal replied to the question saying: “So almost -- see, the 20,000 head count is a factor of voluntary and involuntary attrition. So you should see that. But as we announced, against the 2 percentage, we have midway, so we have done approximately 1 percentage of it. And like what Krithi just mentioned, we don't have a target.”",Around 376 employees of tata consultancy services (tcs) were laid off at the company’s pune campuses over the past two quarters of the current fiscal year.

Rover ready for launch

Far side exploration



Learning from the first attempt



Arab space milestones



Looking ahead







The UAE is moving forward for its historic moment of space exploration. Rashid Rover 2, the country’s second lunar rover, has passed an important round of tests in the US. These checks mean it’s now one step closer to heading to the Moon’s far side in 2026, riding aboard Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost Mission 2 lander.Before leaving the UAE, Rashid Rover 2 went through thorough environmental and functional checks. In the US, engineers worked with Firefly Aerospace to see how it interacts with the lander. They tested the rover’s electrical systems, software, and mechanical parts. Wireless communication between the rover and lander was also checked. Finally, they ran deployment and drive off simulations to make sure the rover can safely move around once it reaches the Moon.Salem Al Marri, head of the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre, said all tests were successful and confirmed the rover is ready. Dr Hamad AlMarzooqi, project manager for the mission, highlighted that the work with Firefly is focused on precision and reliability, reflecting the UAE’s larger goals in space exploration.Rashid Rover 2 will explore the Moon’s far side, the part that never faces Earth. The terrain there is rough and the crust is thicker than on the near side.The rover is equipped with cameras and scientific tools to study the Moon’s surface temperature, soil, plasma environment, and photoelectron sheath.This data will help plan future lunar missions and could guide the use of lunar resources.The mission is also international. The rover will carry instruments from Australia, NASA, and the European Space Agency. Farah Zuberi from Firefly Aerospace said the successful testing brings the mission closer to deployment and will provide new insights into this mysterious region of the Moon.Rashid Rover 2 is the UAE’s second attempt at a lunar landing. The first, Rashid Rover 1, launched in December 2022, was lost in April 2023 when the Japanese lander it was riding, Hakuto R Mission 1, crashed. This second attempt builds on those lessons and aims to succeed where the first one failed.The UAE’s lunar mission is happening alongside another milestone. The first joint Arab satellite, 813, launched from China this week. The 260 kilogram satellite is for Earth observation and was developed by engineers from the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Bahrain, Sudan, Kuwait, Oman, and Lebanon.The satellite’s name refers to 813 AD, when Baghdad’s House of Wisdom became a public academy. Salem Al Qubaisi, director general of the UAE Space Agency, said the project helps build research capabilities, train Arab talent in space science, and provide climate data for countries in the region.Rashid Rover 2 is scheduled to launch in early 2026 for a 10 day mission on the Moon’s far side. If all goes well, the UAE will become only the second nation to land there. The rover’s work will provide data for future missions and underline the UAE’s growing role in global space research.","Rashid rover 2 is scheduled to launch in early 2026 for a 10 day mission on the moon’s far side.

Indian matchmaking: How Bela Bajaria desified Netflix,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-matchmaking-how-bela-bajaria-desified-netflix/articleshow/125936287.cms,"TOI CORRESPONDENT FROM WASHINGTON

Donald Trump Attacks $72B Netflix–WBD Deal, Demands CNN Be ‘Sold Or Included’ In Mega Merger





: In the global contest to command the world’s attention, few executives have rewritten the rules of entertainment more forcefully than Bela Bajaria, Netflix’s Chief Content Officer. Her life story—born to Indian parents in London, raised in Zambia, and transplanted to Los Angeles as a child—gave her an early understanding of cultural dislocation and the power of storytelling as a bridge. At eight, she shed her accent by watching I Dream of Jeannie and The Brady Bunch, learning American idioms through sitcoms. Decades later, she presides over Netflix’s $18 billion content engine, steering programming across 190 countries and 50 languages, and making decisions that shape what more than 300 million people stream on any given night.Dubbed the “Queen of Streaming” in a recent Forbes cover story, Bajaria’s guiding conviction is that local authenticity fuels global resonance. Under her leadership, Netflix abandoned the model of exporting American formulas to foreign markets. Instead, she championed the idea that audiences everywhere want to see themselves on screen—and that deeply rooted local stories often travel further globally than manufactured international blends.The strategy proved prescient, producing global phenomena like Squid Game, Delhi Crime, and La Casa de Papel, and helping Netflix add more than 40 million subscribers in 2024, pushing revenue to $33.7 billion and profits past $10 billion.Nowhere has Bajaria’s influence been more transformative than in India, a market she approached not only with data but with cultural intuition derived from her heritage. With its 1.4 billion people, 65 percent of them under 35, and more than 800 million smartphone users, India presented both an enormous opportunity and a complex creative terrain. Bajaria rejected the notion of India as a single market; to her, it was “hundreds of markets within one,” each with its own languages, traditions, and narrative rhythms.When she joined Netflix in 2016, Indian programming was sporadic and experimental. By 2020, as Head of Global TV, she had begun building a sustained pipeline of original Indian stories. Sacred Games became a breakthrough, a Hindi noir thriller whose gritty realism resonated far beyond South Asia and drew nearly 30 million global households in its first week. The success validated Bajaria’s core belief: audiences respond most powerfully to cultural specificity, not diluted universality.From there, India became one of Netflix’s most dynamic creative centers. Delhi Crime, now into its third season, made history as the nation’s first International Emmy winner. Indian Matchmaking sparked worldwide memes and discourse. Youth-driven dramas like Mismatched and Class tapped into India’s massive Gen Z population, while regionally rooted Tamil and Telugu thrillers expanded Netflix’s reach into South Indian markets.By 2025, Netflix was releasing more than twenty Indian originals a year, with vernacular output rising 40 percent annually. Bajaria deepened ties with the industry by signing multi-title deals with leading studios and nurturing collaborations with established auteurs and emerging talent alike. This ecosystem-first approach—favoring lasting creative partnerships over one-off projects—embedded Netflix firmly into Mumbai’s production culture.The results traveled far. By 2025, Indian titles accounted for an estimated 15 percent of Netflix’s global top-10 viewing hours. Sanjay Leela Bhansali’s Heeramandi became a worldwide event, trending in more than forty countries. Hard-hitting dramas like The Railway Men found audiences in the United States and Europe, proving that Indian narratives could compete directly with Hollywood on the global algorithmic stage. Meanwhile, Netflix’s insistence on affordable mobile plans and the introduction of an ad-supported tier helped the company grow its Indian subscriber base to around fifteen million despite rampant piracy.This rise of Indian content has unfolded against a broader reconfiguration of the theatrical film business. In Hollywood, the box office recovered somewhat post-pandemic but has remained fragile. Revenues reached roughly $8.7 billion in 2024—below pre-COVID norms—but theatrical attendance is down nearly 40 percent from mid-2010s peaks. Mid-budget films increasingly bypass cinemas altogether, with streaming now generating the lion’s share of revenue for most releases. The theatrical market still thrives for franchise spectacles, pushing global grosses close to $40 billion in 2025, but the middle of the market has been hollowed out by the convenience and scale of streaming platforms like Netflix.In Bollywood, the trajectory has been slightly different, according to industry analysts. India’s box office grew 27 percent in the first half of 2025, buoyed by South Indian blockbusters and pan-Indian hits such as Pushpa 2. Annual revenues approached $2.5 billion, surpassing pre-pandemic benchmarks. At the same time, India’s OTT economy expanded even faster; digital rights deals often exceeded theatrical earnings, and the country’s streaming market—worth an estimated ₹38,000 crore in 2024—is projected to double by 2028. For Indian creators, streaming has become an ally, offering financial stability and global visibility even as theaters remain vital for star-driven, event-scale films.This evolving balance is now set against Netflix’s most consequential move yet: its $82.7 billion bid to acquire Warner Bros Discovery’s studios and streaming assets, announced last week. If the deal withstands antitrust scrutiny and a competing $108 billion hostile bid from Paramount, Netflix would absorb HBO, HBO Max, DC, and Harry Potter—one of the richest collections of intellectual property in entertainment history.The implications for Hollywood are profound. Netflix would become the most vertically integrated global studio, controlling both distribution and a vast library of iconic franchises. Some fear this could compress theatrical windows further, as Netflix historically favors limited big-screen runs. Others see an awards behemoth in the making, blending HBO’s prestige with Netflix’s global scale. For Bollywood, the acquisition presents opportunities as well as risks: Indian creators could gain access to storied Western IP, while the competition for audience attention—already intense—would sharpen further.Through it all, Bajaria is poised to play a decisive role. Her career has been shaped by the belief that stories do not follow rules; they follow human truths. As she guides Netflix into a future potentially enlarged by Warner Bros, the center of gravity in global entertainment may shift once again—from Hollywood outward, from the West to a polyglot mosaic of creators, with India firmly at its core.","Bela bajaria is netflix’s chief content officer. She was born to indian parents in london and raised in zambia. Her guiding conviction is that local authenticity fuels global resonance. Under her leadership, netflix abandoned the model of exporting american formulas to foreign markets.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125936413,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-513834,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

LONDON:





Sophie Kinsella, the author of “Confessions of a Shopaholic” and a series of millions-selling rom-com sequels, died Monday, her family said. She was 55 and had been diagnosed with brain cancer. The family posted on Kinsella’s Instagram account: “We are heartbroken to announce the passing this morning of our beloved Sophie (aka Maddy, aka Mummy). She died peacefully, with her final days filled with her true loves: family and music and warmth and Christmas and joy. “We can’t imagine what life will be like without her radiance and love of life.”Kinsella, who also published under her real name, Madeleine Wickham, announced in April 2024 that she had been diagnosed in late 2022 with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. “I did not share this before because I wanted to make sure that my children were able to hear and process the news in privacy and adapt to our ’new normal,’” she said at the time.Starting in 2000 with “The Secret Dreamworld of a Shopaholic”, titled “Confessions of a Shopaholic” in the US, Kinsella published 10 “Shopaholic” novels, along with other fiction. Her books have sold more than 45 million copies worldwide and have been translated into dozens of languages.The first two “Shopaholic” books were adapted into the 2009 film “Confessions of a Shopaholic”, starring Isla Fisher and Hugh Dancy. Kinsella did not grow up intending to be a writer. One of three girls born to teachers in London, she played piano and violin as a child and also composed music. She told authorpublisher Zibby Owens on her podcastthat the idea of writing never crossed her mind.Kinsella enrolled at Oxford University to study music but switched to the politics, philosophy and economics program after one year. While at college, she fell in love with musician Henry Wickham. The couple had four sons and a daughter.After graduating, Kinsella began working as a financial journalist and spent her commute reading. The idea to write fiction herself began to take shape on the train. She published her debut novel, “The Tennis Party”, in 1995 when she was 24, as Madeleine Wickham. Soon after, she left her journalism job to focus on writing. Six other books, including “The Gatecrasher” and “Sleeping Arrangements”, followed.An otherwise normal shopping excursion sparked the idea for writing her first “Shopaholic” novel. “I remember looking around me and thinking... “We all shop... We talk about it. We do it. We rejoice in it. We make bad decisions. Why hasn’t anybody written about this?” Kinsella said in 2019.Kinsella also wrote “The Undomestic Goddess”, “Remember Me?” and “Twenties Girl”. A young adult novel, “Finding Audrey”, was released in 2015, followed by the children’s book series “My Mummy Fairy and Me.”Her novel “Can You Keep a Secret?” was adapted into a film starring Alexandra Daddario and Tyler Hoechlin in 2019. Her last novel was “The Burnout,” released in 2023.After her diagnosis, she wrote a novella, “What Does It Feel Like”, about a woman with five children who has brain cancer. “I thought people might be curious to know what it’s like to go through this,” Kinsella said in an interview with TV personality Robin Roberts . “I hope it’s full of optimism and love most of all.”","Sophie kinsella, author of ""confessions of a shopaholic,"" dies at 55.

"Watch: Black bear attacks keeper during stage show at Hangzhou Safari Park, viral video triggers safety debate",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/watch-black-bear-attacks-keeper-during-stage-show-at-hangzhou-safari-park-viral-video-triggers-safety-debate/articleshow/125827140.cms,"



A pleasant and peaceful performance at Hangzhou Safari Park in East China’s Zhejiang Province on Saturday turned terrifying when a black bear suddenly attacked its keeper.Several videos are going viral on social media, showing audience members watching as two keepers guided two black bears onto the stage for another round of performance. One bear successfully performed, while the other, nearing the stage, pounced on its keeper and knocked him to the ground, Global News reported.The fallen keeper struggled to escape while nearby staff grabbed chairs and poles to separate the animal. After the bear was pulled away, it lunged at the keeper again, and staff had to use force to separate them.This footage prompted an online debate over whether animal performances should be banned. Other staff immediately intervened and used props to separate the bear from the keeper. Multiple social media users posted videos of the incident recorded during the bears’ show.The park explained that the incident occurred as the keeper was carrying a large bag of carrots and apples; the bear saw the bag, became excited, and pounced on the keeper in an attempt to get the food, according to the notice. The notice also stated that the keeper said the incident reminded him to be more careful in dealings with the bear in the future.The official social media account of Hangzhou Safari Park posted a notice on Saturday stating that neither the keeper nor the bear was injured.One user, Momo, on the China's social media platform commented, “Safety must be a priority, and we should have respect for animals. Never think of them as cute and docile, or that we can control them.”Another user, Zero Geqian Qianqian, also emphasised the need to focus on safety. Many others have called for the cancellation of animal performances. A user named “Don’t Call Me Ma Ma Ma” asked, “When will animal performances be canceled? Isn’t it in animals’ nature to be food-driven and protective of their food?”Some users expressed sympathy for the bear. A user named “The Girl is Out, I’m at Home” said, “A small bear is like a little baby. How could we make it perform? If it has apples, let it eat! If it were your child, would you make it perform first and then eat? If it’s hungry, then let it perform how to eat, it would be happier, the keeper and the bear would be more harmonious, and the audience would still enjoy it.”On the X also, several users commented on the video. One of the user said, ""I see why the Russians train with them 🤣🤣🤣 that bear is a professional grappler.""Another said, ""Maybe if we didn't lock these animals up for our own amusement they wouldn't attack people.""After the video of the bear attack went viral online and sparked debate, the park released a follow-up video showing that the bear and the keeper have since “reconciled.” While feeding the black bear carrots, the keeper gently petted its head and said, “If you want carrots, why did you snatch mine? [Even if you didn’t], I’ll still give you some.” The black bear stood calmly and ate peacefully, displaying a gentle demeanour.",A black bear suddenly attacked its keeper at hangzhou safari park in china.

JERUSALEM: Israel will ban children from using mobile phones in primary schools from February, the education ministry's website said Friday, emphasising the devices' ""negative effects"" on students.In implementing the ban, Israel will join a growing number of countries moving to prevent children from accessing their phones while in educational establishments.""From February 2, a new policy will be implemented in primary schools: children will be prohibited from using mobile phones on school premises,"" the education ministry said in a statement.Education Minister Yoav Kisch said the policy was ""based on studies in Israel and around the world, as well as on the (ministry's) commitment to a healthy and safe educational environment, aimed at reducing the negative effects of students' use of phones.""""Its implementation will include educational programmes in the classroom and dialogue with parents in order to instil balanced phone use, prevent excessive use of social media (by children) and reduce exposure to age-inappropriate content,"" the statement added.Until now, individual schools could decide to ban the use of mobile phones on their premises.Since the start of the school year in September, smartphones have been banned from all schools in the coastal hub of Tel Aviv, through a decision from the municipality.Several countries have already instituted such bans on mobile phones in schools, including Australia and France.UN culture and education body UNESCO said that at the end of 2024, 40 percent of education systems around the world had some sort of ban on smartphone use in schools, up from 30 percent a year earlier.","Israel will ban children from using mobile phones in primary schools from february.

Abu Dhabi seeks to build Bridge between new media & finance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/abu-dhabi-seeks-to-build-bridge-between-new-media-finance/articleshow/125911163.cms,".





ABU DHABI: Instead of waiting for the future of media, Abu Dhabi is building it. The city played host this week to leading names from media and entertainment industries at the Bridge Summit, aptly named for seeking to position the emirate at the intersection between new-age media, innovation and investment.The three-day event at Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre from Dec 8 to 10 buzzed with energy, new ideas, collaborations and MoU deals as thousands of content creators, media brands, communicators, tech developers, AI innovators, investors and academics — who have been working in isolation — converged to brainstorm ideas, analyse future trends in the media industry and discuss ways to monetise them. How to get around the associated risks of privacy violation, fake news and narratives, defamatory content and online harassment were a natural corollary to the discussions.The idea of Bridge Summit originated at a lunch meeting in Abu Dhabi earlier this year between Sheikh Abdulla Bin Mohammed Bin Butti Al Hamed, chairman of UAE National Media Office, and Richard Attias, the Moroccan events producer associated with the Clinton Global Initiative, Nobel Laureates Conference and Davos Forum. The two discussed how UAE could give media, creators, tech innovators, social media outlets and investors a platform to connect and build the future of media.Eight months later, that dream turned into reality with Bridge Summit.Al Hamed, in his opening address, outlined Bridge Summit’s mission to unite media, technology, finance, and culture in building a more trusted, inclusive, and resilient information order.Speaking to TOI on the sidelines of the summit, Jamal Mohammed Obaid Al Kaabi, DG, UAE National Media Office and Bridge Alliance vice-chairman, said the forum seeks to secure a win-win situation for all, be it govts, media, content creators, social media platforms, gamers, investors and technology providers. “We are trying to help everyone — those who have a story to reach production, a company to reach a customer and govts to understand what's happening in the market”.He added: “We believe that Bridge can be the brand that people will trust and look at in the future. We can connect it with media initiatives around the world. We believe that positive narrative can be supported through Bridge”.The global media and entertainment industry generated over $2.8 trillion last year, with gaming alone rivaling film and television at nearly $200 billion. Streaming continues to reshape consumption, while nearly 70% of content creators are already using AI tools.Rubbing shoulders at the summit were former heads of state, journalists, representatives of social media platforms, AI innovators, gaming developers, entrepreneurs and media influencers from across the globe; actors Priyanka Chopra Jonas and Idris Elba and footballer Gerard Pique lent it star power.Over three days of fireside chats, panel discussions, workshops and MoU signing, content creators and influencers took lessons from experts and peers on how to tell their stories better and hold their audience’s attention till the last frame.With artificial intelligence (AI) tools revolutionising the media space and content creation industry, engagements delved into how to maintain a judicious balance between human intelligence and artificial intelligence while tailoring content to suit users’ preferences and attention span.Sessions reflected on how the traditional print and TV journalism is being rapidly taken over by digital news content. Justin Smith, CEO of independent global news company Semafor, predicted that human journalist will continue to be relevant as the primary resource for original information, but must learn to harness the power of AI to add value.Richard Attias, who is on the Bridge board of directors, had a word of caution: “Human intelligence needs to always challenge artificial intelligence. We should not be losing the control of AI, which is like a robot”.According to UK journalist and broadcaster Emily Maitlis, agenda-based journalism is inevitable in the age of social media as one with a louder voice and reach, who can put out his version of the story more convincingly, tends to control the narrative. Adeline Hulin, chief of media and information literacy unit at Unesco, revealed that a global survey had found that 62% users don’t do any fact-checking before forwarding information online; most content creators are unaware of the international standards of freedom of expression; and just 20% users report hate speech. “Unesco has developed a global curriculum for media information literacy. We are working to integrate it with formal education and getting local partners to organise hackathons,” she said.Former deputy PM of UK Oliver Dowden advocated industry-led responsibility over sweeping regulation, saying there should be “clear guardrails” as creator content becomes the primary source of information for young audiences.Al Kaabi said Bridge Summit is just the beginning and “pop up” events will be held each coming quarter across America, Asia, Europe and Africa. “We want to hold a mini-Bridge in India. Also, there shall be more of Bollywood, not just Priyanka, at the next edition of the summit here,” he said.(The writer was in Abu Dhabi at the invitation of Bridge Alliance)","Bridge summit seeks to position the emirate at the intersection between new-age media, innovation and investment.
