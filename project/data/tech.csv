Base Salary: $2 million

Stock Awards & Other Compensation: Majority of his earnings

Security Expenses: Alphabet spent $8.27 million on Pichai’s personal security, marking a 22% increase from the previous year

Google spends 22% more on CEO Sundar PIchai's security

Google’s parent company Alphabet has revealed CEO Sundar Pichai’s earnings for the year 2024. As per Alphabet’s 2025 Proxy Statement, Sundar Pichai’s total compensation for the year 2024 is $10.72 million. This figure reveals a significant decrease as compared to his $226 million earnings of 2022. This drop is mainly attributed to the absence of a large triennial stock award that Pichai received in the previous reporting period. While the overall compensation saw a considerable reduction, details of the breakdown reveal a base salary of $2 million for Pichai. The remaining portion of his 2024 package consisted of stock awards and other compensation.While his base salary remained steady at $2 million (₹16 crore), the majority of Pichai's $10.73 million compensation package consisted of stock-based rewards, along with bonuses and other executive perks. Also, a significant allocation of $8.27 million was designated towards Pichai's personal security expenses. This represents a 22% increase in security-related spending compared to the $6.7 million allocated in 2023.The Proxy Statement also revealed that Google paid $8.27 million for CEO Sundar Pichai’s personal security in 2024. The figure is up almost 22% from $6.78 million in 2023. The increase reportedly came as Pichai travelled extensively in 2024. In a proxy statement with the securities exchange, the company said “In 2024, Sundar’s security arrangements included residential security and consultation fees, security monitoring services, car and driver services, and personal security during all travel.”“We believe these arrangements and costs are reasonable, appropriate, necessary and in the best interests of Alphabet and its stockholders, as they mitigate risks to our business,” it further added. In the document, the company says that “we do not consider these additional security arrangements to be a personal benefit to Sundar because they arise from the nature of his employment responsibilities.”","Google's parent company alphabet has revealed ceo sundar pichai’s earnings for the year 2024.

Why Mark Zuckerberg starts his day without coffee? Know about Facebook founder's viral ‘Rawdog’ routine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/why-mark-zuckerberg-starts-his-day-without-coffee-know-about-facebook-founders-viral-rawdog-routine/articleshow/120843936.cms,"Why Mark Zuckerberg starts his day without coffee? Know about Facebook founder's viral ‘Rawdog’ routine

Mark Zuckerberg follows the ‘Rawdog’ routine, know what it is

Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine key elements

1. No caffeine or external stimulants

Zuckerberg completely avoids caffeine in the mornings. While caffeine is widely used to combat fatigue and boost focus, he believes its absence helps him develop natural resilience and clarity.

This is in stark contrast to other tech leaders who often depend on multiple doses of caffeine throughout the day.

2. Intense physical activity: Brazilian jiu-jitsu and MMA

A central element of Zuckerberg’s morning is two hours of combat sports training, particularly Brazilian jiu-jitsu and mixed martial arts (MMA).

These are not light workouts. Zuckerberg actively engages in grappling and sparring, where split-second focus is essential.

He has stated that unlike running, which allows for mental wandering, jiu-jitsu requires full presence—a factor that helps him “recenter” and transition into work mode.

3. Mental presence and focus

The high-pressure nature of combat sports trains the brain to respond quickly under stress.

Zuckerberg uses these sessions to reset mentally, describing them as more effective than caffeine in waking up both the body and mind.

The risk of failure (being pinned or tapped out) keeps him focused, which in turn reduces stress from external sources.

4. Simplified lifestyle to reduce decision fatigue

Zuckerberg is known for his repetitive wardrobe—gray T-shirts, jeans, and sneakers. This choice is deliberate and helps him save cognitive effort for high-stakes decisions.

Reducing daily trivial choices aligns with psychological research indicating that decision fatigue can impair judgment over time.

5. High-protein diet and caloric intake

Why Zuckerberg chose this path: The influence of early education

How Mark Zuckerberg’s morning routine powers executive performance

Enhanced cognitive function

Martial arts require constant anticipation, pattern recognition, and strategic thinking, which parallels the kind of problem-solving skills needed in high-level business decisions.

Stress management

Physical exertion is scientifically linked to lower cortisol levels and improved mood. Zuckerberg’s training acts as a buffer against the chronic stress of running a global tech company.

Improved executive functioning

The combination of simplified choices, physical rigor, and mental clarity supports better decision-making and reduced mental fatigue during the workday.

How Zuckerberg’s routine compared to Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos, other tech leaders

Executive

Routine Element

Elon Musk

High caffeine intake, long work hours

Jack Dorsey

Fasting, meditation, cold plunges

Jeff Bezos

Prioritizes sleep, slow mornings

Tim Cook

Early rising with structured exercise



Scientific perspective on ‘Rawdog’ routines

Exercise improves executive functioning, especially activities that demand coordination and focus.

Caffeine-free mornings may lead to more stable energy levels, avoiding midday crashes associated with stimulant withdrawal.

Simplified routines reduce decision fatigue, as shown in studies on successful leaders and their minimalist approaches.

Routines are known to play a vital role in shaping the lives and productivity of high achievers across industries. Whether it’s elite athletes, creative professionals, or technology entrepreneurs, the way they start their day often sets the tone for how they approach challenges and decision-making. Among these successful individuals, Mark Zuckerberg—founder of Facebook and CEO of Meta—stands out not just for his innovations in the digital world but also for his unconventional personal discipline. His so-called ‘rawdog’ morning routine has recently drawn public attention for its no-frills, stimulant-free approach to productivity and mental clarity.Unlike many of his peers in Silicon Valley who lean on coffee, energy drinks, or even mind-enhancing drugs to kick-start their day, Zuckerberg’s morning begins with no artificial aids. Instead, he embraces natural energy, physical intensity, and mental focus through a carefully structured regimen centered on Brazilian jiu-jitsu and minimalism. This article provides an in-depth, non-opinionated breakdown of Zuckerberg’s unique routine, detailing its structure, rationale, and implications for performance and mental resilience.The term ‘rawdog routine’, as used by Zuckerberg, refers to a lifestyle approach that entails confronting reality and the demands of the day without the aid of stimulants, drugs, or performance enhancers. The concept is based on the idea of beginning one’s day in a fully natural and present state. For Zuckerberg, this means no coffee, no cannabis, no nootropics, and no artificial substances that could alter his mental state. He has occasionally referred to drinking coffee recreationally while on vacation, but emphasizes that it is never a part of his regular workday schedule.This method, according to Zuckerberg, is about achieving mental clarity and physical readiness through discipline rather than chemical shortcuts. The only supplements he reportedly uses are creatine and vitamin D, both commonly accepted for muscle recovery and general health support.Zuckerberg’s rawdog morning routine is built on five foundational principles, all of which are designed to enhance productivity, reduce stress, and maintain mental sharpness.While Zuckerberg does not publicly share a specific meal plan, it is known that he consumes a high-protein diet, which is critical for recovery and energy post-training.Reports suggest his daily caloric intake may reach up to 4,000 calories, especially to meet the energy demands of intensive physical activity.Zuckerberg has cited his exposure to the DARE (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) program in school as a formative influence behind his stance against drugs and stimulants. This early education helped shape his views on substance use and led to a personal policy of natural energy dependence, rather than chemical performance enhancements.Unlike other Silicon Valley executives who have publicly discussed experimenting with microdosing psychedelics or using smart drugs (nootropics), Zuckerberg maintains a more grounded, drug-free approach to focus and performance.Zuckerberg’s morning routine is not just a personal wellness strategy—it appears to have professional implications as well. Here’s how it aligns with executive performance demands:While Zuckerberg avoids all forms of chemical stimulation, other tech leaders have taken diverse approaches to optimizing performance:Zuckerberg’s ‘rawdog’ method is unique in its emphasis on no external stimulants, which sets it apart from the above figures.While no clinical studies have yet been conducted on Zuckerberg’s specific regimen, related research suggests:","Mark zuckerberg follows the ‘rawdog’ routine, know what it is.

The 22-year-old co-founder of fashion pricing startup Phia got this advice from her mother after she faced queries from potential investors about her future motherhood. While raising funds for Phia with co-founder Sophia Kianni , Gates was asked what would happen if they decided to have children. On the Call Her Daddy podcast, Phoebe shared that this line of questioning prompted a call to her mother. She noted that her mother’s reply was:According to a report by Benzinga, both founders said that these inquiries expose a persistent bias in venture capital. “Always children,” Gates said when asked to name the most common bias they’ve faced.Kianni said she turned the tables on a male investor by asking:she added.Gates and Kianni’s experiences mirror a recent Oxfam study on rising CEO pay, which found that among 45,501 companies in 168 countries with over $10 million in revenue, women occupy fewer than 7% of top leadership roles, the report added.What BIll Gates said about funding Phoebe’s Phia appIn a New York Times interview published soon after Phia’s launch, Bill Gates said that he was “happy” not to fund his daughter Phoebe’s AI-powered shopping app, Phia, because doing so would have meant micromanaging the business.“I thought, ‘Oh boy, she’s going to come and ask.” Gates explained that had he invested, “then I would have kept her on a short leash and be doing business reviews, which I would have found tricky, and I probably would have been overly nice, but wondered if it was the right thing to do? Luckily, it never happened.”Instead of providing capital, Gates offers guidance to his daughter on personnel issues, noting, “When it comes to shopping, I’m not exactly the target audience.”","Melinda french gates told her daughter, phoebe, to ""get up or get out of the game, sis"" bill gates said he was ""happy"" not to fund his daughter's ai-powered shopping app, phia.

Streaming major Netflix co-CEO Ted Sarandos is in India. Sarandos is in India to attend the inaugural World Audio Visual and Entertainment Summit (WAVES). Sarandos was part of a session titled 'Streaming the New India: Culture, Connectivity and Creative Capital,' moderated by Saif Ali Khan . Netflix has completed 9 years in India.During the session, Sarandos asked Saif about his experience of working in the streaming space. The actor said that India has a treasure trove of stories that haven't been told before or explored in depth. ""Like the amazing epics Mahabharata and Ramayana. To make that into a movie, it would be a very long kind of a movie... to select which parts to do and really flesh those things out. Even the Panchatantras, our folk stories. ""I mean, there's so many that I don't know, and so many I do know that I didn't know earlier. I think the world would benefit if we could tell them. And this is like such a great platform to do that,"" he said.Saif Ali Khan starred in Netflix's first Indian original series "" Sacred Games "" in 2018 and more recently starred in the streaming service's heist movie ""Jewel Thief"". Adding about his work with OTT platforms, Saif Ali Khan said that it has been the ""most liberating"" thing for him and many other artists all over the world.""Earlier, we had to kind of fit into some sort of boxes, and there was a form in local style for the kind of thing you had to do. And today, thanks to streaming, we can explore characters in a very different way, and go into much more depth.""And it is a fantastic platform to showcase all kinds of things, long form storytelling... there's a kind of intimacy on the platform,"" he said.""There's no rush to wrap things up in two hours. You can let the story unfold at its own pace. And for someone like me who enjoys exploring characters, it's a great time to be an actor. Also it gives the opportunity to bring longer stories to life, like books that we've read that you could maybe see,"" Saif added.The World Audio Visual and Entertainment Summit (WAVES) was inaugurated by Prime Minister Narendra Modi on May 1. The four-day event brings together over 10,000 delegates, 1,000 creators, 300+ companies, and 350+ startups from over 90 countries.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy on how Trump’s tariffs may not have impact on company’s retail game: ‘I think when you’ve got…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazon-ceo-andy-jassy-on-how-trumps-tariffs-may-not-have-impact-on-companys-retail-game-i-think-when-youve-got/articleshow/120849743.cms,"Jassy highlights advantages of Amazon’s diverse marketplace

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy has presented an optimistic outlook regarding the potential impact of US President Donald Trump's tariffs on Chinese goods, suggesting that the company's extensive retail operations may remain largely unaffected. He elaborated that the very structure of Amazon's e-commerce platform, with its capacity to offer opportunities to a wide array of sellers, may provide an advantage to sellers based in China amidst these new import duties.In comments during a call with analysts following the release of Amazon's strong first-quarter earnings results, Jassy explained that the tariffs on goods from China would negatively impact the US-based sellers.“Retailers who aren’t buying directly from China are typically buying from companies who themselves are buying from China, marking these items up, rebranding and selling to US consumers,” Jassy told analysts on a call.However, he suggested that the complex global supply chain could inadvertently give Chinese sellers an advantage on the e-commerce platform.“These retailers are buying the product at a higher price than Chinese sellers selling directly to US consumers in our marketplace. So, the total tariff will be higher for these retailers than for China direct sellers,” he added.Furthermore, Jassy highlighted the inherent advantage of Amazon's vast and diverse marketplace, which hosts approximately two million independent sellers. He posited that if some US sellers struggle due to increased tariff costs and are forced to reduce their presence, other sellers, potentially those based in different countries, would likely step in to fill the resulting gap in supply.“I think when you’ve got larger diversity like we have, we have a better chance of some of those sellers deciding that they’re going to capture [market] share, and they’re not going to pass on all or any of those tariffs to customers,” Jassy noted.While acknowledging that many sellers might pass on the increased tariff costs to consumers through higher prices, Jassy also pointed out that some sellers, including those operating from different nations, might view the situation as an opportunity to gain market share by absorbing some or all of the tariff costs to attract new customers. He believes that Amazon's large and diverse seller base increases the likelihood of such competitive pricing strategies emerging.Moreover, recent reports have suggested that Amazon is pressurising sellers to bear the increased costs due to tariffs to minimise its impact on its profits. The company said that it is doing what’s best for its customers.","Jassy highlights advantages of amazon’s diverse marketplace.

Bangladesh Currency Crisis: Bangladesh faces currency crisis as central bank halts issuing notes featuring Mujibur Rahman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-faces-currency-crisis-as-central-bank-halts-issuing-notes-featuring-mujibur-rahman/articleshow/120714882.cms,"Approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused

DHAKA: The central bank of Bangladesh has apparently incurred a huge financial loss due to the interim govt’s decision not to issue previously printed notes, with approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remaining unused. The decision aligns with govt’s efforts to diminish Bangabandhu’s presence in public memory.Although bank officials are unwilling to discuss the matter publicly, many, on conditions of anonymity, said the longstanding tradition of obtaining new notes from Bangladesh Bank has been abruptly halted, creating a crisis in the market. On the one hand, the printed money is being wasted without use; on the other hand, customers are suffering as a result, they added.“Notes of various denominations are printed using paper and ink purchased with people’s taxes. Millions of notes with Bangabandhu’s picture are still lying in the vaults of various banks. The Security Printing Corporation does not have the capacity to cancel all the notes at once and print new ones. Therefore, notes with Bangabandhu’s picture cann’t be suddenly cancelled,” Ziauddin Ahmed, former executive director of Bangladesh Bank and former managing director of Security Printing Corporation, told reporters.In this situation, he suggested the printed notes be circulated in the market to alleviate public suffering. “When new design notes come into the market, the old ones should be gradually withdrawn. Generally, notes printed once can be used for a maximum of four to five years,” Ahmed said.According to media reports, Bangladesh Bank is unable to issue new notes to banks in line with demand. The crisis became evident following the country’s political upheaval in Aug last year.Since all forms of currency, including metal coins, feature Mujibur’s image, Bangladesh Bank abruptly stopped issuing new notes early April. As a result, the notes featuring Bangabandhu’s image are not reaching the market. Shops, banks, and citizens are now left with torn and old, dirty notes.According to sources at Bangladesh Bank, the Security Printing Corporation is set to begin printing new design notes next month. In the first phase, new design notes of 20, 50, and 1,000 taka will be printed and subsequently released in the market through banks.","Approximately taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused.

SAN FRANCISCO: Spend enough time in San Francisco, peering into the cyberpunk future, and you may find that weird things like self-driving cars and woolly mammoths start seeming normal.On Wednesday night, people waited impatiently in a crowded room in the Marina district, gazing into a glowing white sphere known as the Orb, having your eyeballs scanned in exchange for cryptocurrency and something called a World ID. The event was hosted by World, a San Francisco startup co-founded by Sam Altman of OpenAI that has come up with one of the more ambitious (or creepy, depending on your view) tech projects in recent memory.Its basic pitch is : The internet is about to be overrun with swarms of realistic AI bots that will make it impossible to tell if we're interacting with real humans on online spaces. To solve this , World has created a program called World ID that will allow users to verify their humanity online. To enroll, users stare into an Orb, which collects a scan of their irises and provide them a unique biometric identifier via an app.In exchange, users receive a cryptocurrency called Worldcoin , which they can spend, send to other World ID holders or trade for other currencies. (As of Wednesday night, the sign-up bonus was worth about $40.) At the event, Altman pitched World as a solution to the problem he called ""trust in the age of AGI."" ""We wanted a way to make sure that humans stay special and central in a world where the internet was going to have lots of AI-driven content,"" he said.","San francisco startup world has created a program called world id that will allow users to verify their humanity online.

Smartphones and tablets will be the first two electronic consumer items to be brought under the ' Repairability Index ' regime.The 'repairability index' is a label that manufacturers put on electrical and electronic equipment to inform consumers about the repairability of the entire product or its components. The index rates products on six core parameters - disassembly depth; repair information; availability of spare parts within a reasonable timeline; software updates; tools; and fasteners (types and availability).A govt-appointed committee has recommended to the consumer affairs department a self-declared 'Repairability Index' by original manufacturers for these products to enable customers to make informed choices. The manufacturers will have to rate the devices on this index upfront so that consumers get full information, as per suggestions of the panel.As per the complaints lodged with National Consumer Helpline (NCH), a large number of consumers face issues while seeking repair for their mobile phone and tablets. The number of such complaints has increased from 19,057 in 2022-23 to 21,020 in 2023-24 and to 22,864 in 2024-25.The govt panel has also suggested that the index should be displayed at the point of sale/ purchase, e-commerce platforms and in the form of QR code on packaged products.In an official statement, the consumer affairs department said that the committee constituted for the Framework on Repairability Index in mobile and electronic sector has submitted its report. Scoring criteria was evolved for each of these parameters and weightages were decided. ""After aggregation of weightages for priority parts, a RI on a five-point numeric scale is arrived at,"" govt said. The panel has identified priority parts which are most prone to frequent failures and have high functional relevance. Now the department will examine the recommendations and come up with a draft guidelines for wider stakeholders consultation before bringing out final guidelines.Sources said since the committee has given its reporter after long consultation with stakeholders, including representatives from Apple, Samsung, Google, Vivo, HMD Mobiles, Dell and HP, there is high likelihood of most of the recommendations becoming part of the guidelines.","Index by original cos will enable people make informed choices.

NEW DELHI: Govt has told industry that current discussions for the proposed trade deal with the US are focusing on products or tariffs lines, and has sensitised it about the possible rules of origin that will determine if an item qualifies for duty concessions or not.During a meeting on Friday, businesses were also asked to be prepared for reciprocal tariffs in some form after the current pause ends in early July.At a meeting with industry on Friday, the commerce department sought a detailed list of non-tariff barriers faced by Indian exporters , which it can take up during negotiations with the United States.India's expectations from the negotiations were not shared with industry representatives, nor were their inputs sought on how to go about sector-specific talks. The meeting, however, marks the first set of consultations with industry amid criticism that India Inc has been kept in the dark about the talks.The key focus was on rules of origin. As per indications, the final rules of origin are likely to be discussed after the product outlines of the deal are decided, sources said. During the meeting with industry representatives, a team of officials led by India's chief negotiator Rajesh Agrawal pointed out that these norms may be different from what Indian players are used to.The US goes by case laws and the norms under the trade deals with Canada and Mexico as well as Japan, that were shared during the meeting, were very different from each other. For instance, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) has a specific set of rules for farm goods, which are applicable to all sides. But when it comes to Japan, it requires a change in tariff sub-heading for spices, while the US insists on it for tea and spices. Similarly, automobiles, textiles and apparel have product specific rules under USMCA, but that does not exist under the US treaty with Japan.Indian industry has been asked to formulate its strategy according to the norms in the US, where change in form, appearance, nature and character of a product is what is insisted upon. In contrast, India's agreements have focused on a certain amount of value addition and changes in product classification.","Indian govt asks exporters to flag us trade hurdles.

Sebi imposes Rs 58.5 crore penalty on Seya Industries’ top executives for financial fraud and fund diversion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebi-imposes-rs-58-5-crore-penalty-on-seya-industries-top-executives-for-financial-fraud-and-fund-diversion/articleshow/120855097.cms,"Markets regulator Sebi has imposed a total penalty of Rs 58.5 crore on four senior officials of Seya Industries Ltd, including promoter and Chairperson Ashok Rajani and his son, Amrit Rajani, for allegedly siphoning off funds and falsifying financial statements over multiple years, news agency PTI reported.In its final 122-page order issued Friday, Sebi found that Seya Industries diverted Rs 81.26 crore to companies linked to the promoter family — namely Whiz Enterprises, Aneeka Universal, and Shri Balaji Entertainments — under the guise of sales and purchases, or via undisclosed fund transfers during FY19, FY20, and FY21. These transactions were concealed and not reported as related party transactions in the company’s financial statements, violating several regulatory norms.The regulator levied a Rs 28 crore fine each on Ashok Ghanshyamdas Rajani (Chairman and Managing Director) and Amrit Rajani (CFO), Rs 2 crore on Executive Director Asit Kumar Bhowmik, and Rs 50 lakh on Executive Director Sivaprasada Rao Buddi.Sebi said Seya Industries also falsified its financial records for FY19 and FY20 through fictitious sales and purchases, in violation of the Prohibition of Fraudulent and Unfair Trade Practices (PFUTP) rules and disclosure obligations.Further, Sebi highlighted that the company’s accounting for interest in FY20 through FY22 and the quarters ending June, September, and December 2022, was not compliant with Indian Accounting Standards.Despite these findings, Sebi clarified that no punitive action is currently being taken against the company itself due to the ongoing insolvency proceedings under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC). The regulator said it will address the case against the company in a separate order.Sebi observed that Ashok Rajani, being at the helm of Seya Industries, was deeply involved in the day-to-day operations and personally signed off on misleading financial statements for four consecutive fiscal years. His son, Amrit Rajani, was held equally responsible for overseeing financial irregularities.“I note that Amrit Rajani, being CFO of the company and looking after the day-to-day affairs of the company, was a KMP of the company at the relevant time and thus, is responsible for the violations committed by the company,” Sebi Whole-Time Member Ananth Narayan G said in the order.Executive Directors Bhowmik and Buddi, tasked with ensuring compliance and accurate financial reporting, were found to have failed in their responsibilities, damaging investor trust in the securities market. Both were found to have violated insider trading, PFUTP, and disclosure rules.All four individuals — Ashok Rajani, Amrit Rajani, Bhowmik, and Buddi — have been barred from accessing the securities markets for five years. They are also prohibited from holding positions as directors or key managerial personnel (KMP) in any listed company or Sebi-registered intermediary for the same duration.Additionally, Sebi has directed Amrit Rajani to ensure that the Rs 81.26 crore siphoned off through promoter-linked entities is returned to Seya Industries within six months, along with 12% annual interest from the date of diversion.The action follows complaints filed between 2020 and 2021 by SC India Fund Manager, which accused the company of raising funds through private placement based on inflated financial statements. After Seya failed to cooperate with the National Stock Exchange (NSE), Sebi appointed Ernst & Young in September 2021 to conduct a forensic audit. The investigation focused on the financial years ending March 2019, 2020, and 2021.","Sebi found that seya industries diverted rs 81.26 crore to companies linked to the promoter family.
