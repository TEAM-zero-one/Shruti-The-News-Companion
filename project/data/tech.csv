NHAI Toll Fee Deduction: False toll fee deduction? NHAI cracks the whip,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/false-toll-fee-deduction-nhai-cracks-the-whip/articleshow/118668029.cms,"NEW DELHI: Have you ever received a toll deduction message from your FASTag wallet even though your car was parked or you hadn't passed through a toll plaza? Officials explain that this can occur when toll operators mistakenly enter the vehicle number, often due to issues with the FASTag being unreadable for various reasons, or when people carry tags in their wallets.Cracking down on such instances of ""false"" deductions from FASTag wallet, the NHAI has penalised toll collectors in at least 250 cases. For each violation, the highways authority's toll management entity, IHMCL, has started imposing a fine of Rs 1 lakh.Due to this high penalty, the number of such cases has reduced by almost 70% and now 50 such genuine complaints reach IHMCL in a month while nearly 30 crore FASTag transactions happen at all plazas on the national highway network.Many users have taken to social media to highlight instances of false toll deductions from their FASTag wallets, in addition to lodging complaints with IHMCL. ""Customers facing false deductions can file a complaint by calling 1033 or emailing falsededuction@ihmcl.com and each case is thoroughly investigated. And if the complaint of such deduction or incorrect manual transactions is established, chargebacks are issued to the customer immediately. Additionally, a Rs 1 lakh penalty is imposed on the toll operator responsible,"" said a senior IHMCL official.He said, the main reason for such false deductions is entry of incorrect vehicle numbers by toll operators while processing electronic transactions manually.","Nhai has penalised toll collectors in at least 250 cases of ""false"" deductions.

Elon Musk questioned by Tesla shareholders as stock declines for sixth consecutive session: ‚Äúshare five things you did for Tesla shareholders this week‚Ä¶‚Äù,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/share-five-things-you-did-for-tesla-shareholders-this-week-elon-musk-questioned-by-tesla-shareholders-as-stock-declines-for-sixth-consecutive-session/articleshow/118688836.cms,"Elon Musk called out by investors as Tesla‚Äôs stock struggles continue

‚ÄúPlease share five things you did for Tesla shareholders this week. Or are you working remotely? Asking for all of us.‚Äù

Tesla stock performance and financial concerns

Increased competition in the EV market from legacy automakers such as Ford, GM, and global competitors like BYD.

Production and delivery challenges, with supply chain disruptions affecting Tesla‚Äôs output.

Leadership distractions, as Musk continues to divide his attention across multiple ventures, raising concerns about Tesla‚Äôs long-term strategic direction.

Regulatory scrutiny over Tesla‚Äôs Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology and ongoing legal challenges related to product safety.

Elon Musk‚Äôs expanding commitments raise concerns

Tesla investors have expressed growing frustration as the company‚Äôs stock continues to decline, marking its sixth consecutive session of losses. Shareholders are increasingly holding CEO Elon Musk accountable, questioning his recent actions and decision-making. The backlash follows Musk‚Äôs controversial demand for U.S. federal employees to justify their salaries by listing five accomplishments each week‚Äîa strategy he previously implemented at Twitter. Now, investors are turning the tables, demanding to know what Musk has done for Tesla shareholders as the stock tumbles.The discontent highlights broader concerns over Musk‚Äôs leadership, particularly his divided focus across multiple ventures, including SpaceX, Neuralink, The Boring Company, and his latest role as the U.S. government‚Äôs ""efficiency czar."" The ongoing criticism has sparked debates about his commitment to Tesla, a company once celebrated as the frontrunner in the electric vehicle (EV) industry.Amid Tesla‚Äôs stock decline, shareholders have taken to Musk‚Äôs own social media platform, X (formerly Twitter), to air their grievances. Celebrity photographer Jerry Avenaim was among those calling out Musk, posting:Accompanying the post was a stock performance graph showing Tesla‚Äôs downward trend. The sarcastic remark directly referenced Musk‚Äôs demand that federal employees justify their roles with weekly accomplishment lists, which had drawn criticism from government workers.Tesla investors are now challenging Musk using his own words, asking him to justify his leadership as stockholders witness losses. The growing unrest among investors signals a shift in sentiment, as many once ardent supporters now express skepticism over Musk‚Äôs priorities and Tesla‚Äôs future.Tesla‚Äôs stock has faced significant volatility since the start of 2025, with sharp declines raising concerns among investors. While Musk remains a visionary figure in the tech and automotive industries, recent market performance suggests that investor confidence may be wavering.Several factors have contributed to Tesla‚Äôs stock drop, including:Market analysts have warned that Tesla‚Äôs declining stock could further erode investor confidence unless Musk reaffirms his commitment to the company‚Äôs growth and stability.One of the key points of contention among shareholders is Musk‚Äôs involvement in multiple ventures beyond Tesla. His leadership roles at SpaceX, Neuralink, The Boring Company, and X have raised questions about whether he is stretched too thin.Additionally, Musk‚Äôs new role as the U.S. government‚Äôs ""efficiency czar"" has sparked debate. Appointed under Donald Trump‚Äôs administration, Musk has been tasked with improving governmental operations. However, critics argue that this political involvement further diverts his focus from Tesla at a critical time.Musk‚Äôs controversial management style has also drawn criticism. His push for extreme work culture at Twitter, mass layoffs, and controversial statements on social media have led some investors to question whether similar turbulence could impact Tesla‚Äôs stability.","Elon musk called out by investors as tesla‚Äôs stock struggles continue to decline.

‚ÄòFalse FASTag toll deduction ‚Äô: The National Highways Authority of India ( NHAI ) has taken strict action against incorrect FASTag wallet deductions, penalising toll collectors in approximately 250 instances.FASTag users sometimes get toll deduction messages even when their vehicles are parked at home or haven't crossed toll plazas. Officials attribute this to toll operators' errors in vehicle number entry, particularly when FASTag becomes unreadable, or when individuals carry tags in their wallets.IHMCL , the highways authority's toll management body, now levies a Rs 1 lakh fine per violation in such cases. According to a TOI report , this substantial penalty has resulted in a 70% reduction in such incidents.Currently, IHMCL receives about 50 legitimate complaints monthly, compared to 30 crore FASTag transactions across national highway toll plazas.Users have reported false toll deductions on social media platforms and through formal complaints to IHMCL. ""Customers facing false deductions can file a complaint by calling 1033 or emailing falsededuction@ihmcl.com and each case is thoroughly investigated. And if the complaint of such deduction or incorrect manual transactions is established, chargebacks are issued to the customer immediately. Additionally, a Rs 1 lakh penalty is imposed on the toll operator responsible,"" said a senior IHMCL official.Also Read | Turnaround from importer to exporter!

The system facilitates automatic toll fee deductions from a connected prepaid account, which users can control via FASTag applications. This electronic tag, attached to the vehicle's windscreen, establishes communication with toll plaza scanning equipment.NHAI implemented FASTag, making it compulsory for all vehicles.

Large-cap shares, where LIC maintains considerable investments, have also experienced substantial losses.ITC, LIC's second-largest equity investment, has contributed significantly to the portfolio's decline, with an 18% decrease resulting in approximately Rs 17,000 crore value reduction. Technology companies TCS and Infosys, where LIC maintains 4.75% and 10.58% ownership respectively, have declined, reducing the portfolio value by Rs 10,509 crore and Rs 7,640 crore, according to ACE Equity data.In the banking sector, LIC's substantial investments in SBI (9.13% stake) and ICICI Bank (7.14% stake) decreased by Rs 8,568 crore and Rs 3,179 crore respectively.

MUMBAI: Adani Wilmar (AWL) is acquiring GD Foods which sells a range of sauces, pickles and other food products through its brand Tops. The acquisition will allow the company to step up its play in the kitchen essentials category and offer more choices to consumers in a competitive consumer goods market.The acquisition will be closed in tranches- AWL will initially acquire 80% shares from the existing promoters of GD Foods in a deal valued at Rs 603 crore. The remaining 20% will be acquired in a phased manner over the next three years. GD Foods will continue to operate as a separate entity, AWL said in a filing on Tuesday.Based in New Delhi with sales primarily concentrated in parts of North India, GD Foods started operations in 1984 as a noodles brand and eventually expanded its product portfolio, covering pickles, sauces, tomato ketchup, jams and other food items like instant mixes and corn flakes.

Telecom Minister Jyotiraditya Scindia has maintained that satcom spectrum cannot be auctioned due to technological constraints.‚ÄúPlease understand that technologically there's a big difference between spectrum that is meant for terrestrial networks and spectrum that's allocated to satellite-based, non-terrestrial networks. As far as terrestrial networks are concerned, you can allocate frequencies exclusively which can‚Äôt be used by others‚Ä¶ that spectrum cannot be allocated to a single entity. It is shared. How do you auction something that's shared? You can't,‚Äù he has said.Musk‚Äôs application for satcom license is still pending with govt over issues of security clearances.

NEW DELHI: Traditional incentives like salary seem to have become less significant this year for Indian employees as workplace flexibility, job security, opportunities for learning and development and sense of belonging take centre stage, according to talent firm Randstad.Last year, employees prioritised work-life balance, followed by remuneration and job security. According to Randstad India's Workmonitor 2025 survey, 52 per cent of the Indian workforce would leave a job if it lacked sufficient flexibility, compared to 31 per cent globally. Flexibility continues to be a key decision-making factor, with 60 per cent of employees rejecting a job without flexible working hours and 56 per cent declining roles lacking flexibility in work locations, the survey added.The findings indicate that employees are increasingly prioritising work that resonates with their personal values and life goals, moving beyond financial incentives. Job security, mental health support, and work-life balance now hold more significance. In fact, pay has dropped to the fourth spot, reflecting a shift toward a more holistic view of employment.Further, the demand for flexible working hours is significantly higher across all generations in India compared to the global average due to unique socio-economic and workplace dynamics.Viswanath PS, MD & CEO, Randstad India, said, ""The generational divide in Indian workplace expectations is narrowing, and the data is clear - flexibility is no longer a benefit; it's a baseline expectation across all age groups. Whether it's Gen Z entering the workforce, millennials balancing career growth with personal commitments or Gen X in leadership roles, everyone values the ability to work on their own terms. This shift signals a fundamental change for organizations - flexibility must be embedded into work design, not treated as a perk. Equally, the demand for continuous learning highlights that talent isn't just looking for jobs - they are looking for careers that evolve with them.""Gen Z (62 per cent vs 45 per cent globally) received flexible working hours as they enter a digital-first job market where long commutes, cultural expectations around family involvement and high job competition make work-life balance essential.","Last year, employees prioritised work-life balance, followed by remuneration and job security.
