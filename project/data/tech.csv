NEW DELHI: An ambitious campaign that began on Sept 13 will reach its grand finale on Dec 8 at a glittering ‘Ideas for India’ summit, where some of the finest minds in the country — ranging across diverse sectors like business, tech, policy, and academia — will assemble to brainstorm innovations that could transform the nation, and 12 winners whose ideas were chosen after a gruelling selection process will be felicitated. Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman will be the chief guest and deliver the keynote address.The Times of India launched the Ideas for India initiative as a powerful thought-leadership platform, recognising that achieving the national vision of ‘Viksit Bharat’ by 2047 requires not just economic momentum, but a fundamental reimagining of solutions. The campaign was conceived with the core belief that answers to India’s greatest challenges lie within its people.The initiative has tapped the country’s innovative energy, drawing thousands of registrations from students, entrepreneurs and change-makers across India. At its heart is a nationwide Innovation Challenge that moves beyond speeches and slogans to focus on actionable blueprints.Participants were invited to submit solutions across three critical pillars – Make in India for the World, Environmental Sustainability, and Health & Social Wellbeing – with a focus on scalability, feasibility and impact.The promise is clear: your idea today can contribute to India’s progress tomorrow, provided it can be executed on the ground and deliver measurable change.Entries were expected to address real-world gaps, from inclusive industrial growth and skilling to clean energy, water security, mental health, digital inclusion and social equity.The Innovation Challenge cast its net wide across emerging and priority sectors such as green and renewable energy, healthcare and health tech, advanced manufacturing, cyber security and digital public infrastructure, agri-tech, urban mobility, water and climate resilience, waste management and circular economy, logistics, and education and skilling.To ensure rigour and transparency, the process was structured as an end-to-end framework. After a national call for entries through a dedicated microsite, TechGig conducted the first-level screening, with EY validating the scoring and shortlisting. A 28-member screening jury of entrepreneurs, CXOs, marketing and tech leaders then helped narrow the list down to 67 submissions, from which 34 finalists emerged.Shortlisted participants were tasked with building first-cut prototypes and received one-on-one mentorship from a panel of five experts in early Dec. Their refined solutions were then presented before a Grand Jury of senior industry leaders and policy voices, split across two groups to evaluate categories such as Economic Resilience, Environment & Sustainability, and Health & Social across tech and non-tech streams.The journey now culminates in a National Summit, where around 30 of the most promising innovators will present their ideas and prototypes to policymakers, experts and industry leaders, and 12 winners will finally be chosen. A dedicated compendium will capture the 30 blueprints that made it to the finals — ideas that not only stood up to rigorous evaluation, but can also serve as potential building blocks for the Viksit Bharat that India envisions in 2047.","30 innovators will present ideas, prototypes at national summit on dec 8.

Right to Disconnect Bill 2025: Supriya Sule moves legislation to promote work-life balance for employees after office hours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supriya-sule-moves-bill-to-ensure-right-to-disconnect-after-office-hours/articleshow/125803345.cms,"Supriya Sule (ANI image)

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha member Supriya Sule has introduced a private member's Bill in the Lower House to promote work-life balance for workers and employees in India.The Bill, ""The Right to Disconnect Bill, 2025"", seeks to impose sanctions at a rate of 1 per cent of the total remuneration of its employees on entities (companies or societies) for any non-compliance with the provisions of the Bill.The Bill, as introduced in the Lok Sabha on Friday, provides every employee the right to disconnect from work-related electronic communications.""It aims to foster a better quality of life and a healthier work-life balance by reducing the ""burnout caused by today's digital culture,"" she wrote on X.While digital and communication technology offer benefits in terms of work flexibility, it also carries a significant risk of eroding the boundaries between professional and personal life, she argued in the private member's Bill.""Studies have found that if an employee is expected to be available round the clock, they tend to exhibit risks of over-work like sleep deprivation, developing stress and being emotionally exhausted. This persistent urge to respond to calls and emails (termed as 'telepressure'), constant checking of emails throughout the day, and even on weekends and holidays, is reported to have destroyed the work-life balance of employees,"" the statement of objects and reasons of the Bill read.""According to a study, the constant monitoring of work related messages and emails, may overtax employees' brains leading to a condition called 'info-obesity'.""The Bill argued that there is a need to respect the personal space of the employees by recognising their right to disconnect and not respond to their employer's calls, emails etc., during out-of-work hours.""The need is also to recognise the rights of the employees, it also takes into consideration the competitive needs of the companies and their diverse work cultures. Flexibility in the right to disconnect rules and leaves it to the individual companies to negotiate terms of service with their employees is need of the hour,"" the Bill further read.The digital transformation has direct impact on conditions in the employment contract, like the time and the place of work.Hence if an employee agrees to works during out-of-work hours, overtime pay at the same rate as his wage rate is also necessary to check the surge in unpaid overtime work, brought about by digital transformation, she argued in the Bill.The Bill also provides for counselling services to increase awareness among employees and citizens, on reasonable use of digital and communication tools, for professional and personal use.To free an employee from digital distractions and enable him to truly connect with the people around him, the Bill provides for digital detox centres.""The Bill thus champions for the rights and welfare of employees, by mandating individual entities to negotiate out-of-hour service conditions with their employees, and upholding the right of employee to disconnect. The Bill seeks to recognise right to disconnect as a way to reduce stress and ease tension between an employees' personal and professional life,"" the Bill concluded.She introduced all together what she termed forward-looking Private Member Bills in the Parliament - the other two were The Paternity and Paternal Benefits Bill, 2025. It introduces paid paternal leave to ensure fathers have the legal right to take part in their child's early development. It breaks the traditional model, supports the new mother's well-being, and promotes flexible parenting.The other one is the Code on Social Security (Amendment) Bill, 2025, that recognises platform-based gig workers as a distinct category, ensuring minimum wages, regulated hours, social security, fair conditions, and equitable contracts to ensure a fairer, more sustainable environment and economy for them.Several other members of the Lok Sabha also introduced their Private Member Bills in the House.","Lok sabha member supriya sule has introduced a private member's bill to promote work-life balance for workers and employees in india.

Sanchar Saathi App Row In LS: Cong Flags Privacy Fears, Scindia Says 'Snooping Not Possible'

NEW DELHI: A new controversy seems to be building up over discussions within govt for satellite-assisted location tracking of mobile phone users for the needs of law enforcement agencies and disaster management officials.The matter, which has been in discussion for over five years now, had seen a suggestion by the mobile phone operators lobby, Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), that govt order compulsory activation of A-GPS technology. This uses satellite and mobile data to give accurate and accelerated location of an individual. However, no action has been taken on the matter by the ministry of electronics and IT (Meity), which had been conducting talks with the industry — both mobile operators as well as device makers. Currently, phone operators provide location of individuals by tracking users through mobile towers, which lack pinpoint accuracy, while also being delayed in giving the coordinates.Sources said not much progress had been made in five years around implementation over issues related to user privacy as well as reluctance of device makers such as Apple and Samsung over mandated activation. The device makers argue that user consent needs to be taken before activation of pinpoint satellite-based location tracking.Also, they have expressed fears that other service providers, and even hackers, may misuse the always-on location tracking services, violating user privacy.The issue has come to the fore at a time when govt rescinded on a plan to mandate pre-installation of Sanchar Saathi app after outcry over possible state surveillance as well as user privacy violations. In this case too, global manufacturers such as Apple and Samsung had told the department of telecom — which had issued the pre-installation order — of their objections to the measure, citing user privacy.","The matter has been in discussion for over five years now.

Biocon to merge biologics unit in $5.5 billion deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/biocon-to-merge-biologics-unit-in-5-5-billion-deal/articleshow/125809572.cms,"Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw said the combined entity would position Biocon among the few global players with scale in both generics and biologics



NEW DELHI: Biocon will fully integrate its biosimilars arm, Biocon Biologics into the parent, in a deal valuing the unit at $5.5 billion.The move is aimed at creating a unified biopharma powerhouse, and to strengthen its global position to lead in diabetes, oncology, and immunology — therapeutic areas that together account for nearly 40% of global pharma revenues, Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw, executive chairperson, Biocon said on Saturday.Biocon will acquire the remaining stake in Biocon Biologics from Serum Institute Life Sciences (Serum), Tata Capital and Activ Pine through a share swap of 70.28 Biocon shares for every 100 Biocon Biologics shares, at a price of Rs 405.78 per Biocon share.Further, Biocon will acquire the residual stake held by Mylan (Viatris) for $815 million, split between $400 million in cash and $415 million through a share swap of 61.7 Biocon shares for every 100 Biocon Biologics shares at a price of Rs 405.78 per Biocon share.“The combined entity will offer a unique portfolio spanning biosimilars, insulins, GLP-1 peptides and complex generics, positioning Biocon among the few global players with scale in both generics and biologics. Further, we will combine the synergies in oncology and immunology with the products, in biosimilars and generics,” said Mazumdar-Shaw.As the only company operating globally with both biosimilar insulins and generic versions of complex peptides, including GLP-1s, Biocon is poised to address the rapidly expanding ‘diabesity’ market, according to a company statement.The company’s board also approved raising additional capital, of up to Rs 4,500 crore ($500 million) through Qualified Institutional Placement (QIP), subject to shareholder approval. The proceeds of the QIP will be largely utilised towards the cash component payable to Viatris.After the transaction and planned fundraise, the promoters’ stake in Biocon is expected to drop to around 44.4%.Biocon Biologics chief executive Shreehas Tambe will become CEO and managing director of the combined entity post-integration, and Kedar Upadhye will be the chief financial officer. Biocon CEO Siddharth Mittal will transition to a group leadership role, the statement added. The swap ratios have been approved by the board based on independent valuations by EY.Explaining the move, Mazumdar-Shaw said, “We had created Biocon Biologics as a separate entity to attract investments and for a strategic global focus on biosimilars. Over the years, we did that successfully, even acquiring Viatris’ biosimilars business for $3 billion. But markets kept devaluing both Biocon and Biocon Biologics because of debt overhang and holding company discount. Now the board feels it’s a better decision to stay together and consolidate, as it gives us a much stronger balance sheet. ”","Biocon will fully integrate its biosimilars arm, biocon biologics into the parent.

Kayla Nicole turns heads in Antigua swimsuit photos



Kayla Nicole, the ex-girlfriend of Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce , has everyone talking again this weekend after a burst of new vacation photos put her right back at the center of attention. She may have ended her relationship with Kelce nearly three years ago, but her presence has only grown stronger as she continues to build a career that blends journalism, fitness leadership, and digital influence.Through her brand, Tribe Therepe, Nicole has carved out a space that celebrates what she calls “feel good fitness.” The Pepperdine University graduate believes in training both the mind and body, and she often opens up about her own journey. “It’s focusing on the mental health component of working out, which is really, really important for me and really resonates with me, and really just encouraging people to mentally take care of themselves,” Nicole said, via PEOPLE. She added, “I think that when your mind is in a healthy place, your body will follow. So, I started going to therapy and quickly realized, okay, it’s one thing to be physically fit, but it’s another thing to be mentally fit.You could be in the best shape of your life, but mentally, if you are not a healthy person, it’s not going to feel good.”Kayla Nicole sparked a wave of reactions online after sharing swimsuit photos from her Antigua getaway. She captioned one post, “Literally, where I want to be,” giving followers a glimpse of her carefree beachside moments. In another set of snaps, the 34-year-old posed in a string, animal print bikini paired with a brown cowgirl hat, a look that quickly drew praise from fans.Her social feeds have remained active and upbeat even as she navigates the online backlash that has followed her since Kelce began dating Taylor Swift. Nicole addressed that pressure during an appearance on the Unapologetically Angel podcast. “I would be lying if I said that that level of hate and just online chaos doesn’t impact me,” she said. “It does. Even to this day.” She added, “It has nothing to do with me. I think there’s something about that level of fame that attracts crazy people. And it’s unfortunate because I’ve never done anything to warrant that kind of backlash.”Still, support is rising, and Nicole continues to be candid about her personal life. On Harry Jowsey’s “Boyfriend Material” podcast, she joked, “I keep saying I don’t want to date any more athletes, but I’m down to date the owners of the teams.” She has also shared that she gravitates toward powerful, driven men. “I would love to just date someone that — I do think that I am attracted to men in positions of power and I also think that those types of men are attracted to me. ”Meanwhile, Kelce is happily engaged to Taylor Swift, with a wedding expected in the summer of 2026. But for Nicole, this chapter seems filled with confidence, travel, and a growing community that now appears louder with love than with criticism.Also Read: Alix Earle’s two-year romance with NFL receiver Braxton Berrios collapses unexpectedly after her Dancing With the Stars run","Kayla nicole sparked a wave of reactions after sharing swimsuit photos from her antigua getaway.

The NFL has grown into a financial powerhouse where players turn their on-field success into long-term business wins. Many stars earn far beyond their salaries through smart investments, brand deals, and ventures that keep paying even after retirement. Their financial journeys show how discipline, strategy, and timing can redefine an athlete’s legacy.This list dives straight into the league’s wealthiest names and how they built their fortunes. From record-setting quarterbacks to players who mastered the business world early, each story proves that money in football comes from far more than trophies. These athletes combined talent with opportunity and turned their careers into thriving financial empires.Tom Brady may have retired in 2023, but his financial reach continues to grow. Celebrity Net Worth places him at 300 million dollars, a figure built on decades of elite play and smart business decisions. In 2022 alone, he earned 75 million dollars from salary and endorsements with Aston Martin, Under Armour, and TAG Heuer. After leading the New England Patriots for 19 seasons and winning a seventh Super Bowl with Tampa Bay, he expanded his empire through a deal with Fox Sports and his wellness company TB12.Brady’s choices show how a player can turn fame into a long-term business platform.Aaron Rodgers remains one of the most accomplished quarterbacks in the NFL and one of its sharpest earners. Celebrity Net Worth estimates his wealth at 200 million dollars. His three-year, 150 million dollar extension with the Green Bay Packers in 2022 made him the highest-paid quarterback at that time. He later signed a one-year deal with the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2025 worth an estimated 10 million dollars. Rodgers boosts his income with partnerships that include State Farm, Adidas, Pizza Hut, and Bose. He also invests in tech startups and real estate and is a minority owner of the Milwaukee Bucks.Minnesota Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins built his fortune through consistent play and a focus on guaranteed money. Celebrity Net Worth places him near 180 million dollars. His steady rise comes from major contracts, brand deals like Tostitos, and smart investments. One source noted, “Cousins has had large guaranteed contracts, and endorsement deals.” His approach matches his own words: “I’m going to keep my head down and just keep working — that’s how I control my outcome. ” Kirk Cousins may not generate as many headlines as others, but his financial discipline makes him one of the league’s strongest earners.Russell Wilson signed a one-year, 10.5 million dollar deal with the New York Giants in 2025, but his largest payday came from a five-year, 245 million dollar contract with the Denver Broncos in 2022.

Stafford invests heavily in real estate, including a nearly 20 million dollar home in Los Angeles.

Shannon Sharpe explains his blunt message to Odell Beckham Jr. on Nightcap Podcast

Shannon Sharpe has sparked a loud money debate after reacting to Odell Beckham Jr. ’s recent comments about finances in the NFL . The former Denver Broncos star spoke honestly after rumors spread online that Beckham may have sold his game-worn cleats for $50,000. While the sale itself has not been confirmed, the timing brought fresh attention to Beckham’s views on athlete money struggles.The discussion began when older clips from The Pivot Podcast resurfaced on social media. In the interview, Odell Beckham Jr. explained how big contracts do not mean as much as fans think once taxes and daily expenses come into play. Those words divided opinion. Some fans understood his point. Others felt he was out of touch.As the clips went viral again, Shannon Sharpe stepped in with a strong response. Speaking on his Nightcap Podcast, Shannon Sharpe shared his own experience and broke down the numbers in a clear way. His message was simple. With smart planning, most players should not struggle after earning millions.During his appearance on The Pivot Podcast in October, Odell Beckham Jr. spoke openly about money pressure in the NFL.“I’ve always explained this to people, bro: you give somebody a five-year, $100 million contract, what is it really?” Beckham said. “It’s five years for 60. You’re getting taxed. Do the math; that’s 12 a year that you have to spend, use, save, invest, flaunt, whatever.”He continued by explaining why spending rises fast for star players.“I’mma buy a car. I’mma give my momma a house. Everything costs money,” Beckham said. “But we weren’t taught about no financial literacy. We weren’t taught this skill.”As those clips spread again online, reports and rumors claimed Beckham sold game-worn cleats for $50,000. Soon after, Shannon Sharpe shared his take on the matter while hosting Nightcap Podcast with Chad “Ochocinco” Johnson.Sharpe focused on investment basics and long-term thinking.“If you bring home $60 million liquid theoretically, you put that in a fund, you gonna get 5 to 8%,” Sharpe said. “There’ll be some years you get 10, 12%. So even if you’re just getting 5% on $60 million, that’s $3 million a year, man.”He then delivered his blunt conclusion.“If you can’t live off $3 million a year, you got issues,” Sharpe said.Not everyone criticized Odell Beckham. Comedian Mike Epps offered support while speaking to TMZ.“Sometimes, you can’t measure lifestyle with money,” Epps said. He also added advice, saying, “So, you gotta make sure you control the lifestyle, and then your money will be controlled with it.”Odell Beckham Jr.’s last NFL contract was with the Miami Dolphins, reportedly worth $3 million. The deal ended by mutual agreement in December 2024, and Beckham remains a free agent.Also Read: “This Is Deeply Ironic”: Tom Brady Gets Roasted During The World Cup Draw After Surprising Gisele Bündchen Connection Goes Viral","Odell beckham jr. spoke openly about money pressure in the nfl during an appearance on the pivot podcast.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg welcome note

I'm excited to welcome Alan and Billy to Meta to work with me, Boz, and our team to drive this important work forward.

We're entering a new era where AI glasses and other devices will change how we connect with technology and each other. The potential is enormous, but what matters most is making these experiences feel natural and truly centered around people. With this new studio, we're focused on making every interaction thoughtful, intuitive, and built to serve people.

Alan will be joined by Billy Sorrentino, another acclaimed design lead from Apple; Joshua To, who has led our interface design across Reality Labs; our industrial design team led by Pete Bristol; and our metaverse design and art teams led by Jason Rubin.

The new studio will bring together design, fashion, and technology to define the next generation of our products and experiences. Our idea is to treat intelligence as a new design material and imagine what becomes possible when it is abundant, capable, and human-centered. We plan to elevate design within Meta, and pull together a talented group with a combination of craft, creative vision, systems thinking, and deep experience building iconic products that bridge hardware and software,” wrote Zuckerberg.

Dye’s legacy at Apple





Facebook-parent Meta has announced the appointment of Alan Dye, one of Apple ’s most influential design leaders. Dye will head the newly created creative studio inside its Reality Labs division. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made this announcement on social media platform Threads.

Since taking over Apple’s design studio in 2015, he helped shape the look and feel of flagship products including the Apple Watch, iPhone X, and the Vision Pro headset. Most recently, he oversaw Liquid Glass, Apple’s new interface design that gives UI elements a transparent, fluid aesthetic.Bloomberg, which first reported his move, noted that Dye’s team also worked on upcoming smart home hardware.","Alan dye, one of apple’s most influential design leaders, is leaving apple for meta.

She faced severe harassment, stalking, and exploitation of her image. The constant abuse and safety threats have deeply impacted her happiness. QTCinderella spent thousands removing fake images and avoids her own shop due to safety fears. She now prioritizes creating a safer online environment for creators.

Streamer reveals disturbing safety threats, high expenses, and the emotional toll of public exposure





Twitch star QTCinderella has built an empire on creativity, humor, and community, but the life behind the camera has been far more painful than fans might imagine. Known publicly as one of streaming’s leading organizers and the creator of The Streamer Awards, Blaire (her real name) has spent years fighting against harassment, stalking, and the online objectification of women in gaming.While many viewers see her as an influential and successful content creator, she says the career came with a cost she never truly anticipated. Looking back, she believes the emotional weight of streaming has chipped away at her happiness to the point where she wishes she had never pressed “go live” in the first place.Speaking to the BBC, QTCinderella shared that she felt “incredibly lucky” to have a platform but wished she could warn her younger self to walk away. “The biggest thing I wish I could do, if I went back and was able to whisper in my ear, I would say, don’t do it,” she said, describing how constant abuse has shaped her daily life. She revealed she can “open my Instagram DMs right now and read you 100 horrible things about why or how I could be harmed by people. ”The harassment isn’t limited to insults, her image has been manipulated, sold, and circulated without consent. In 2021, she spent over $2,000 every month trying to remove edited images of herself from the internet.Things escalated further when she discovered deepfakes using her likeness in explicit content. Those experiences left her questioning how platforms can protect creators, especially as AI technologies make exploitation easier.Even her offline life became unsafe. Blaire explained that she avoids visiting her own craft shop in Los Angeles because men repeatedly showed up looking for her, putting employees at risk. “I would have been a happier person if I had never been a streamer,” she implied through her reflections.After multiple streamers, including Pokimane, Valkyrae, and QTCinderella, skipped TwitchCon 2025 due to safety concerns, the streamer is now preparing for her upcoming awards show with what she calls “aggressive” security. Still, she remains passionate about building a safer industry. “For me, it’s really important to bring people together, because I do think there’s lots of toxicity on the internet.”Her message is clear: streaming can be a dream, but without protection, it can also become a frightening and isolating reality.Also Read: Why is rapper 6ix9ine being sent back to prison again?

One step renewal

Citizen driven design

Faster and efficient

Part of zero bureaucracy





In a major step towards seamless government services, the UAE has introduced a unified system that allows Emirati citizens to renew their passports and Emirates ID cards in a single, integrated process. The move, part of the “Zero Bureaucracy” initiative, promises to cut processing times, reduce administrative hurdles, and transform the way citizens manage key identity documents.The Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP) has launched a smart service enabling citizens to renew both passports and Emirates ID cards together. Previously, individuals had to complete separate applications for each document, navigate different forms, and make multiple payments. The new system consolidates all these steps into one seamless process via the UAEICP smart application.Citizens whose passports have expired and whose Emirates ID is due to expire within six months will now see an option to renew both documents on a single page within the app. The platform also allows users to update personal information and photographs without needing to re-enter data multiple times.The integrated renewal service directly addresses public concerns identified during the “Zero Bureaucracy Expo.”Many residents expressed frustration over managing different expiration dates for passports and ID cards, which often caused administrative confusion. By synchronizing the renewal process, the government ensures that citizens no longer have staggered expirations, simplifying document management.Officials highlighted that the system’s development was shaped by citizen input, evolving from a simple service improvement into a comprehensive smart solution. This reflects a broader commitment to responsive governance, where services are designed to meet the real needs of the public.The new unified platform is expected to cut processing times by at least 50 per cent while reducing inquiries and customer calls by around 40 per cent. It supports the national goal of simplifying procedures, improving government responsiveness, and delivering faster, more integrated services.By centralizing the management of all passports and identity documents for an entire family, the application represents a major leap forward in digital government services. The initiative prioritizes efficiency, quality, and tangible impact, leveraging technology and best practices to make citizens’ lives easier with minimal effort.This development forms part of the second phase of the Zero Government Bureaucracy (ZGB) Programme, launched in June by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai. The program aims to establish a world-leading model for government services, emphasizing proactive, user friendly, and fully integrated digital solutions.The unified passport and Emirates ID renewal service exemplifies the UAE government’s ongoing commitment to eliminating unnecessary administrative hurdles and creating a modern, citizen-centric public service environment.","Emiratis can now renew passports and emirates id together in one step via uaeicp app. The move, part of the “zero bureaucracy” initiative, promises to cut processing times, reduce administrative hurdles, and transform the way citizens manage key identity documents.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125801330,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-null,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Beyond speed





Dubai Police has once again elevated its globally recognized luxury patrol fleet, unveiling an ultra-rare, customized Ferrari Purosangue Mansory, a 755-horsepower powerhouse that is one of only seven units modified worldwide. Marking 12 years of their strategic use of supercars, the Ministry of Interior confirmed the addition will be deployed in major tourist attractions like the Burj Khalifa to boost visibility, assist visitors, and underscore Dubai's commitment to security, innovation, and high-end excellence.Dubai Police has redefined luxury law enforcement once again by adding a highly customized Ferrari Purosangue Mansory to its world-famous fleet. This new patrol car is not just a high-performance vehicle; it is a global rarity, being one of only seven customized units of its kind in the entire world.The vehicle was specially modified by the German tuning house Mansory, giving it an aggressive yet sophisticated look perfectly suited for the streets of Dubai. The custom upgrades include a full carbon-fibre exterior kit, a sporty front bumper, a prominent rear wing, and custom forged FC.5 wheels.Inside, the cabin features a bespoke interior with premium leather and carbon-fibre trims, reflecting the city’s commitment to high-end excellence.The car’s performance is as impressive as its looks. This machine is powered by a massive 6.5-litre V12 engine, which produces an incredible 755 horsepower and 730Nm of torque. This power allows the patrol car to rocket from 0 to 100km/h in a mere 3.1 seconds and reach a top speed of 320km/h.The unveiling of the customized Ferrari took place at an anniversary event held in front of the iconic Emirates Towers. This celebration marked a significant milestone: 12 years of the Dubai Police’s luxury patrol fleet.The concept of using supercars for police patrols began in 2013 with the introduction of a Lamborghini, quickly turning the fleet into an international symbol of Dubai's innovative approach to security. Today, the luxury fleet has grown to an impressive 56 high-performance vehicles.The strategic purpose of these vehicles, including the new Ferrari, is not chase or speed, but enhanced visibility and global branding.Brigadier Saeed Al Hajri, Director of the General Department of Criminal Investigation, confirmed that the fleet reflects Dubai Police's commitment to innovation and service excellence. He stated that the new patrol will operate across major tourist hubs to assist visitors and strengthen community engagement.The luxury patrols are mobile service units, ensuring a highly visible and approachable presence where the police force can interact directly with residents and millions of visitors.The new Ferrari Purosangue Mansory will be immediately deployed in key tourist zones, including the Burj Khalifa, Mohammed bin Rashid Boulevard, and Jumeirah Beach Residence (JBR). By positioning these eye-catching cars in high-traffic areas, the police aim to bolster the sense of safety and showcase Dubai’s modern image.The fleet’s community role extends far beyond patrolling. Lieutenant Colonel Muhammad Abdulrahman noted that the patrol cars have participated in 1,184 events over the last three years. Crucially, they are also used to engage with the public on a personal level, having helped fulfil 49 wishes for children between 2023 and 2025, reinforcing the police’s focus on community happiness and positive interaction.","Dubai police unveils 755hp ferrari suv for patrols.

Out(rage)d! Cashing in on your anger,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/outraged-cashing-in-on-your-anger-oxford-rage-bait-word-of-the-year-2025/articleshow/125800368.cms,"Is your 'rage' their product?



Do you have the choice to not get 'rage baited'?



Are women at the receiving end of this rage?







If you clicked on that headline, sorry — you’ve just been rage-baited.But that's exactly what the platforms are doing, rage-baiting us into their content.That’s why 'rage bait' didn’t just trend this year, it muscled its way to Oxford’s Word of the Year for 2025, beating out terms like 'aura farming' and 'biohack' without even breaking a sweat.Rage bait is defined as “online content deliberately designed to elicit anger or outrage by being frustrating, provocative, or offensive, typically posted in order to increase traffic to or engagement with a particular web page or social media content”.Is it the same as clickbait? No.For instance, don’t read this article. It can make you angry — that would’ve been a classic clickbait headline. Tugging at curiosity, not outrage.To understand this phenomenon, the TOI spoke with economic and psychological experts.One of Oxford's reasons for its selection of 'rage bait' for the top post was its threefold increase in the last 12 months. It also noted a ""deeper shift"" in ""how we talk about attention — both how it is given and how it is sought after — engagement, and ethics online.""Does this mean that people's 'rage' is the new kind of 'attention' that platforms like Instagram, Facebook, X and other social media websites are competing to get?""Anger holds economic value on digital platform,"" said Surya Bhushan, an alumnus of, CESP, JNU, now economics professor at DMI, Patna.He added that ""they drive higher engagement metrics — like comments, shares, and views — that platforms reward with algorithmic boosts and direct monetisation.""Does this mean that if you type ""hasna tha kya"" on someone's standup reel, the algorithm will push more such reels just because you got angry?Content creator Divija Bhasin, who sees this dynamic in real time, however, disagreed. ""I don’t think the algorithm pushes my content specifically to people who will be offended by it,"" she said, who recently received extreme reactions on her ""proud R-movement"", a reel she posted after getting repeated called the Hindi slur word.However, she further noted that while the algorithm doesn’t push content to offended people on purpose, it ends up sending it to people who will be offended by it because it cannot differentiate between “positive” interest shown vs “negative” interest shown.""Anger-based content definitely undermines consumer autonomy,"" the professor said.He added that though the consumers have freedom to ""scroll or engage"", the rage bait content ""prioritises emotional hacks over rational choice"", calling it a way of ""trapping users in addictive loops of reaction and counter reactions.""Herbert Marcuse, who was a part of the Frankfurt school of critical theory in the 20th century, helps make sense of this. He argued that capitalism creates choices that feel liberating but mostly serve the system.Can rage bait be classified as that? Are social media platforms built to reward it? Does it mean that when we think we’re choosing what to watch, we’re really choosing from options designed to keep us reacting, not thinking?Bhasin, who is also a psychotherapist, noted that since ""misogynistic content is normalised"" and doesn’t act as rage bait ""for the average audience, especially men"", any kind of ""progressive content"" ends up being at the receiving end of their anger.""Misogynistic content is normalised and therefore doesn’t create a sense of rage for the average audience, especially men. So inevitably, any kind of progressive content is titled as rage bait because change from the norm will always evoke some level of denial in the viewer. It makes it seem like feminist content creators just want to make people angry,"" she said.""When actually it is sad that misogynistic content does not make people angry. Misogynistic content is the real rage bait as it capitalises on the subjugation of women,"" she added.Indian online spaces are increasingly turning into hotspots for gender-based violence, a report by international human-rights groups Equality Now and Breakthrough Trust found, as it went on to highlight the gaps in the legal framework.Bhasin cited concerns over the lax attitude of online platforms, saying that they ""definitely capitalise on rage shown by men on purpose by not doing something to fix this problem.""""They are definitely aware of the kind of hate men spread on female influencers’ content. They are choosing to ignore it because it counts as time spent on the time, even if it is to hate on female influencers,"" she said.","Rage bait is defined as ‘online content deliberately designed to elicit anger or outrage by being frustrating, provocative, or offensive, typically posted in order to increase traffic to or engagement with a particular web page or social media content’ 'anger holds economic value on digital platform,' said surya bhushan, an alumnus of, cesp, jnu, now economics professor.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125804459,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1340472,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
