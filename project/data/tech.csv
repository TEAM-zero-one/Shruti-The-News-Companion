Reports Suggest Elon Musk Might Spend $40M on Super Bowl Ads Targeting Government Waste,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/reports-suggest-elon-musk-might-spend-40m-on-super-bowl-ads-targeting-government-waste/articleshow/118089210.cms,"Image via Getty Images

The Rumors Behind Musk’s Super Bowl Ad Campaign

Tesla and Electric Vehicles – The Super Bowl could be the perfect stage for Musk to unveil Tesla’s latest advancements, such as the highly anticipated Roadster 2.0 or new self-driving capabilities.



X (formerly Twitter) and Free Speech – Musk has repeatedly positioned X as a platform for unrestricted speech. A Super Bowl ad could promote its vision as the ""everything app.""



Dogecoin and Cryptocurrency – Musk has long been a supporter of Dogecoin. A playful ad could reinforce his support for the cryptocurrency, potentially driving up its value.



SpaceX and the Future of Space Travel – A teaser for the first human mission to Mars or a futuristic ad about space tourism would undoubtedly capture global attention.



Will Musk Attend Super Bowl LIX?

As the excitement builds for Super Bowl LIX , speculation is swirling about whether billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk will make a surprise appearance in the coveted lineup of commercials. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO, known for his unconventional marketing strategies and social media presence, is rumored to be spending a staggering $40 million on multiple Super Bowl ads. But is there any truth to these claims? Here’s what we know so far.Super Bowl commercials are among the most expensive advertising slots in the world, with millions tuning in to watch the spectacle. This year, a viral tweet from a user suggested that Musk is planning to run five commercials during the game, allegedly targeting government spending inefficiencies, particularly through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).Musk has been vocal in his criticism of USAID, calling it a ""viper’s nest of radical-left Marxists"" and questioning its funding. His newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has reportedly been working to expose what he perceives as unnecessary expenditures. While there has been no official confirmation from Musk or his representatives, the billionaire has a history of making bold, unexpected moves, which keeps fans and critics on edge.If Musk were to air a Super Bowl ad, it would likely focus on one of his flagship ventures. Here are a few possible themes:Beyond the ad speculation, there is curiosity about Musk’s presence at the game. He has attended the last two Super Bowls, once alongside media mogul Rupert Murdoch and later with his son, X Æ A-12. With former U.S. President Donald Trump making history as the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl, many wonder if Musk will follow suit, especially given his growing political influence.Whether or not Musk’s ads air during the game, one thing is certain—his presence, both physically and digitally, will be felt at Super Bowl 2025.","Elon musk is rumored to be spending a staggering $40 million on multiple super bowl ads.

The Internet Reacts—Criticism, Defenses, and Calls for Saquon Barkley to Stay Focused

Timing is Everything—Why Is This Resurfacing Now?



Check out our live coverage of Super Bowl LIX and find details on how to watch Super Bowl live on Times of India.



The internet has a long memory, and right now, it’s turning against Anna Congdon , fiancée of Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley . Just as the NFL world shifts its focus to the upcoming Super Bowl, Congdon has found herself at the center of controversy.Old tweets from over a decade ago have resurfaced, and they’re sparking major backlash online. The posts, which reportedly contain racial slurs—including the N-word in Disney movie titles—have ignited a wave of criticism, with many questioning her past actions and calling for accountability. Social media users wasted no time in digging up the problematic content, leading to heated discussions about whether past mistakes should define a person today.Screenshots from 2012 and 2013, when Congdon was around 13 years old, have been making rounds online, showing her casually using offensive language in tweets. Some of the resurfaced posts include:A play on Kanye West’s “Gold Digger” lyrics, where she wrote,A hashtag game where she swapped words in Disney movie titles with racial slurs, such asWhen a friend pointed out she should add an “s,” she doubled down, replying,A tweet from 2013 where she said sheThis isn’t the first time these tweets have surfaced. Back in 2018, when the controversy initially blew up, Congdon swiftly deleted most of her Twitter history before 2015. However, with screenshots resurfacing now, the internet is once again divided. Some are calling her out for the language, while others argue that these were tweets from her teenage years and should be left in the past.Another major talking point? Her biracial children. Some commenters are now questioning whether she still uses such language in private, especially around her kids. Meanwhile, Barkley’s supporters are urging him to ignore the drama and focus on his Super Bowl run.Interestingly, the timing of this scandal isn’t random. It comes just as Congdon’s recent engagement to Barkley was revealed—though reports say the proposal actually happened six months ago. Whether the timing is a coincidence or calculated, the controversy is stealing headlines right before one of the biggest moments in Barkley’s career.For now, neither Barkley nor Congdon has publicly addressed the resurfaced tweets. But in the world of social media, nothing stays buried forever.Also read - Bill Belichick & Jordon Hudson Spark Engagement Rumors with Two Rings—She Addresses One, But What About the Other?","Anna congdon’s old tweets from over a decade ago have resurfaced.

LONDON: Thames Water , which serves 16 million customers in and around London, is seeking court approval for up to 3 billion pounds ($3.7 billion) of emergency funding to prevent the cash-strapped company from falling into government administration.The high court in London began a four-day hearing on the financing package on Monday, with Thames Water facing off against smaller creditors who complain that the deal is too expensive and favors bigger investors. Creditors holding about 90 per cent of the company's debt have already backed the deal.Without the funding, Thames Water will run out of money in March, which could force the government to temporarily nationalize the company. Both the government and Thames Water say water will continue flowing to customers regardless of what happens.Thames Water, which has about 17 billion pounds ($20.9 billion) of debt and has been repeatedly cited for illegal sewage spills, is at the center of a nationwide backlash over rising water bills as Britain seeks to modernize its water and sewage systems to cope with climate change and a growing population.The company has been the focus of criticism from consumers and politicians who say Thames Water created its own problems by paying overly generous dividends to investors and high salaries to executives while failing to invest in pipelines, pumps and reservoirs. Company executives say the fault lies with regulators who kept bills too low for too long, starving the company of the cash it needed to fund improvements.Ofwat, which regulates water companies in England and Wales, in December approved a 35 per cent increase in Thames Water's consumer charges over the next five years. The company argued that bills needed to rise 53 per cent in order to finance needed projects and provide the financial returns necessary to attract investors.The company has until February 18 to appeal the decision.","Thames water is seeking court approval for up to 3 billion pounds ($3.7 billion) of emergency funding.

BEIJING: China's sluggish domestic consumption got a boost over the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday , with travel and retail sales both offering a slight reprieve to a dragging economy facing the prospect of an escalating US trade war.Train stations and airports across the country were jam-packed for weeks as millions returned home for the festive period in an annual migration that is expected to be a record.Official data showed there were 500 million domestic tourist trips during the eight-day holiday period, commerce ministry spokeswoman He Yongqian said Thursday.That's a 5.9 per cent jump from the same period last year, when travel numbers returned to pre-pandemic levels.Meanwhile, sales of ""key retail and catering services nationwide"" were also up, by 4.1 per cent compared to last year, He Yongqian told reporters in Beijing.The government has struggled to get China's billion-strong army of consumers to inject cash into the economy as a prolonged real estate crisis weighs on confidence.But last month, policymakers expanded a subsidy scheme for common household items, from water purifiers and refrigerators to laptops and electric vehicles.During the holiday period, sales of household appliances and communication equipment at ""key monitored retail enterprises"" were up more than 10 percent year-on-year, according to the commerce ministry.China recorded five per cent growth in gross domestic product last year, among the slowest in decades.Beijing will likely look to hit the same goal of ""around five per cent"" in 2025 but that could be hindered by threats of an escalating trade war.At the weekend, US President Donald Trump announced additional tariffs of 10 percent on all Chinese imports, with Beijing hitting back immediately with tariffs of its own, targeting coal and gas.","500 million domestic tourist trips during the eight-day holiday period.

When contacted, an official spokesperson with Wabag said, tender for the Yanbu project has been recently re-announced. ""We are currently preparing the bid and will submit the same. The earlier tender was cancelled due to the internal decision of the customer. What we understand is that they decided to change some specifications/scope, etc of the project. Being a public procurement process, they had to only adopt the process of cancelling and retendering the project,"" the spokesperson added.","Va tech wabag has secured a consortium order valuing about rs 3,251 crore ($371 million) for setting up an independent sewage treatment plant (istp) at riyadh in saudi arabia.

More than 75% of consumer durable purchases are being backed by EMIs, said Nilesh Gupta, director at Vijay Sales. Five years back, this share was at 55-60%.Easy financing options and low EMIs have enabled the middle class to opt for premium products, Fumiyasu Fujimori, MD, PMIN at Panasonic Life Solutions India told TOI, adding that the segment is buying the firm's IoT enabled connected appliances, inverter ACs and top load washing machines. Think tank PRICE defines the middle class as households earning between Rs 5 lakh to Rs 30 lakh per annum. Credit card companies and brands typically offer incentives to customers buying through EMIs, fuelling this trend; the repo rate cut by RBI could also allow brands to offer better EMI options going ahead, Gupta said.""Post-Covid, we have seen consumers going for product upgradation and it has not changed,"" Gupta said. There should be further acceleration in the adoption of premium products among urban and aspirational consumers on the back of the Budget boost which will increase disposable incomes, said N S Satish, president at Haier Appliances India. ""The income tax relief will leave consumers with disposable incomes but this may lead them to spend on items like consumer durables using EMIs, weighing on the share of FMCG spends,"" said Mayank Shah, VP at Parle Products.EMIs essentially allow consumers to make payment for a product in smaller tranches and the trend will continue as many consumers do not have surplus savings to pay for high-ticket items at one go, said Angshuman Bhattacharya, partner at EY-Parthenon. Job-creation and increase in wages will be the long-term key to boosting consumption. ""Consumers are aspiring more but wages have not risen in sync,"" said Bhattacharya.Jewellery companies like Malabar Gold are offering gold saving schemes, flexible payment options and exchange programs to allow consumers to manage price fluctuations and make purchases, said M P Ahammed, chairman at Malabar Group. Some companies, for instance, have a scheme wherein it allows consumers to make small deposits for 11 months and at the end of the period, a select section from the store inventory can be purchased at no making charges.In the FMCG space, the scenario is starkly different. Across categories like personal care, snacks and soaps, there is a growing preference for smaller packs as consumers are seeking flexibility in managing their budgets. The trend is most pronounced in middle-income households, said Shivam Puri, CEO & MD, Cipla Health. Even in premium segments, consumers are buying smaller packs. ""We are seeing growth in the premium category for lower-priced SKUs... consumers are strategically managing their spend by selecting lower-priced options within the segment,"" said Rajeev Jain, SVP, corporate marketing at DS Group.",There is a slowdown in urban consumption as the middle class household budgets get stretched.

'Health insurance to beat motor business',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/health-insurance-to-beat-motor-business/articleshow/118100663.cms,"MUMBAI: Health insurance's share in the non-life segment is set to surpass other categories put together as the sector continues to expand, the chief of standalone health insurer Niva Bupa Health Insurance said.At present, health is the largest segment with a 40% share of total non-life premium. According to Krishnan Ramachandran, MD & CEO of Niva Bupa Health Insurance, the industry is growing at 14-15%, with significant potential for further expansion and the company's British parent Bupa is 'excited' about the Budget move to allow 100% foreign direct investment.""Unlike motor insurance, the second-largest segment, which depends on new vehicle sales, health insurance has vast scope due to its low penetration. Globally, five of the top 10 insurers by market capitalisation operate in health insurance.""According to Ramachandran, insurance regulator Irdai's decision to allow a 10% hike in senior citizen premiums can be implemented while maintaining a combined ratio of 95%. The combined ratio represents the proportion of claims and management expenses to total premiums. The total premium income of the non-life industry was 2,89,673 crore in FY24. ""Health insurance in India remains affordable. A family can secure coverage for around 2% of the sum insured, which is reasonable,"" he said.Niva Bupa is leveraging technology to scale operations without increasing fixed costs. ""All our policies are digitally onboarded, 51% are issued straight through with automated underwriting, and 21% of retail claims are automatically approved.""Bupa has a different structure compared to other insurers. As a private company limited by guarantee, it does not distribute dividends but reinvests profits. Niva Bupa is one of Bupa's two group companies that are listed. Despite the listing, Ramachandran said the company is not under pressure for quarterly profits as its promoter, Bupa, and former promoter and largest shareholder, True North, have a long-term business focus. The 2024 IPO reduced Bupa's shareholding from 62% to around 55% to create space for foreign investors while staying within the then 74% FDI cap.","At present, health is the largest segment with a 40% share of total non-life premium.

Bajaj Auto to ride into e-rickshaw segment by end of ongoing fiscal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bajaj-auto-to-ride-into-e-rickshaw-segment-by-end-of-ongoing-fiscal/articleshow/118083501.cms,"NEW DELHI: Bajaj Auto is gearing up to enter the domestic e-rickshaw segment by the end of this fiscal to tap a 'sizable opportunity' in a fast-growing but highly unorganised market, according to a top company official. The company expects to get regulatory clearances towards the end of the ongoing quarter for its e-rickshaw that will enable it to enter the segment which is about 45,000 units a month, Bajaj Auto Executive Director Rakesh Sharma told analysts.""By the end of this financial year, we also intend to launch a modern 'e-rick', which will set an absolutely new standard in the segment and bring a very high level of satisfaction to both owners and passengers.The e-rick segment is almost as large as the auto segment and the new e-Rick should generate new business, he said.When asked for the exact timeline, Sharma said, ""We expect to launch the e-rick by the end of this quarter, let's say, by the end of the FY25 fiscal. By the time all the permissions are through, it may just spill over into the first week of April or retails may spill over to the first week of April or they may just commence by the end of March even.Explaining the rationale behind the move, he said, ""It (e-rickshaw) is a sizable opportunity. We don't sell anything in it. Almost 50 per cent of three-wheeled mobility is in the e-rick space, which is in the north and east, little parts of west.He further said, ""Almost 45,000 e-ricks are retailed every month and they come in various shapes and sizes. It's a very fragmented market. A lot of it is import-dependent. A lot of it is a substandard product but it's a very good format for certain use cases.Stressing that the demand is there, Sharma said, ""By introducing our e-rick, we hope to organise this market and bring in fresh new business for us. I guess we will start to see a real scale-up in the first quarter of the new fiscal.""On the company's electric scooter Chetak , he said Bajaj Auto expects to increase market share in the electric two-wheeler segment on the back of the newly introduced '35 platform' that provides a ""higher range, advanced displays, faster charging and best-in-class boot space"".""This already introduced two variants should make a strong play for higher market share in the upper half of this EV segment where our presence has been relatively weak. The new series will also have a very positive impact on the bottom line, too,"" Sharma said.Sharma further said, ""A major swing into the profitability zone will be achieved in Q4 as the 35-Series acquires scale beginning February.""The combination of the new platform, which will be further expanded in this quarter, and the continually expanding exclusive stores currently over 250 and wider distribution to over 3,000 sales points will continue to drive the business towards a stronger leadership position and on a profitable basis, he said.","Bajaj auto expects to get regulatory clearances towards the end of the ongoing quarter for its e-rickshaw.

"Amazon reports strong earnings for Q4, but stocks dip due to outlook for the 1st quarter",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/amazon-reports-strong-earnings-for-q4-but-stocks-dip-due-to-outlook-for-the-1st-quarter/articleshow/117998797.cms,"Amazon on Thursday reported better-than-expected revenue and profits for the holiday shopping period, but its stocks dipped in after-hours trading due to disappointing guidance for the current quarter.The Seattle-based e-commerce and technology company said its revenue for the October-December period totaled $187.8 billion, a 10% jump compared to the same period in 2023. Profits came out to $20 billion while earnings per share reached $1.86, higher than the $1.49 that analysts surveyed by FactSet had anticipated.But the company said it expected revenue for the current quarter to be between $151 billion and 155.5 billion, lower than the $158.56 billion that analysts were expecting. The guidance anticipates ""an unusually large, unfavorable impact"" from foreign exchange rates, it said.Amazon is the biggest online shopping destination in the U.S. and has long been a beneficiary of consumer spending during the holidays. As it has done in recent years, the company in October began offering promotions intended to lure early holiday shoppers. It advertised other discounts during the three-month period, including on major sales days such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.Amazon on Thursday reported it saw $75.5 billion in revenue for its online shopping business, up 7% from the same period in 2023.Across the retail industry, holiday sales in November and December were better than expected compared with the previous year as lower inflation on holiday goods enticed shoppers to buy, according to The National Retail Federation. Online shopping also saw record sales levels, Adobe Analytics reported in January.Sales for Amazon Web services, the company's prominent cloud computing unit, rose 19% during the fourth quarter. But it fell slightly below analysts expectations.Amazon is one of the biggest players in the competitive tech race around generative artificial intelligence. Like other tech companies, it has ramped up investments in the technology and is spending billions to expand data centers that support AI and cloud computing. The company is also spending money on other equipment, including its own computer chips and those developed by Nvidia. It has also rolled out its own AI models and integrated the generative AI into other parts of its business.In the fourth quarter, Amazon reported spending $27.8 billion on property and equipment, significantly higher than the same period in 2023. Most of the spending was geared towards AI and AWS, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during a call with analysts on Thursday.""We think virtually every application that we know of today is going to be re-invented with AI inside of it,"" Jassy said. ""I think both our business, our customers and shareholders will be happy medium-to-long term that we're pursuing the capital opportunity and the business opportunity in AI.""Jassy also said during the call that Amazon, like many others, was ""impressed"" by DeepSeek, the Chinese artificial intelligence company whose chatbot recently became the most downloaded app in the U.S.Amazon's quarterly report also comes as the retail industry is absorbing a new 10% tariff President Donald Trump imposed on Chinese imports on Tuesday. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been put on hold for about a month.Trump also thew out a trade exemption that allowed low-value shipments from China to bypass duties, a loophole that had given an advantage to China-founded e-commerce firms, such as Shein and Temu.The new tariffs could benefit Amazon by increasing costs for its competitors. But it would also impact Chinese sellers who connect with American consumers on the company's shopping platform. Furthermore, it could raise prices on a recently-launched online storefront that Amazon set up to ship low-cost products directly from China. The storefront, called Amazon Haul, was Amazon's answer to Shein and Temu.Additionally, analysts from Morgan Stanley wrote in a Monday note that Amazon's first-party retail business, though which the company sells products purchased from manufacturers, has the highest exposure to the tariffs. The analysts estimate 25% of the merchandise sold through that business comes from China.","Amazon reported better-than-expected revenue and profits for the holiday shopping period.
