MUMBAI: The green cover in India has absorbed more carbon than it emitted annually in the last decade, but the rate of sequestration declines during extreme climate events such as drought, a study has revealed. The study by researchers at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Bhopal, also stressed the critical role of vegetation in climate change mitigation and adaptation.Green vegetation absorbs carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and releases it back into the air through respiration.""The overall balance between this uptake and release of CO2 is known as the net ecosystem exchange (NEE). When the NEE is positive, it means vegetation is releasing more carbon than it absorbs, and when it's negative, it indicates that the vegetation is effectively storing carbon,"" said Dhanyalekshmi Pillai, associate professor, head of the Max Planck Partner Group Germany, and of the Earth and Environmental Sciences, IISER Bhopal.""For the last decade, India's (green) ecosystem absorbed more carbon than they emitted annually, with annual NEE estimates ranging from 380 to 530 million tonnes of carbon per year,"" she said.Researcher and co-author of the paper, Aparnna Ravi, said this level of carbon sequestration is impressive but tends to decline in response to climate extremes, emphasising the critical role of vegetation in climate change mitigation and adaptation.Scientists also studied how different types of vegetation across India help absorb CO2 each year.Pillai said evergreen forests in India are highly efficient in capturing CO2 through photosynthesis. However, the deciduous forests in central India released more carbon into the atmosphere as plant respiration surpassed primary productivity.""They (green vegetation) released 210 million tonnes of carbon annually, acting as carbon sources. Although croplands are less effective at absorbing carbon per unit area than forests, their extensive coverage across the country benefits significant CO2 removal from the atmosphere,"" she said.Pillai said the sequestration rate is not constant but shows a decreasing trend, especially in response to drought.She said drought is an example of climate extremes, and these conditions are increasing due to climate change.""Green vegetation is favouring us (reducing global warming), but the sequestration potential cannot be limitless...under climate extremes, it shows decreasing sequestration. This is concerning,"" Pillai said.She said the study reflects on creating and implementing effective climate policies and ecosystem management in consonance with nationally prioritised action plans.IISER scientists, in collaboration with international experts, led and established an innovative technology-driven approach using highly resolved observations of plants' fluorescence (""glow"") and advanced physics-based computer models to quantify vegetation's carbon sequestration potential across India for the first time.In this novel approach, IISER-Bhopal researchers led long-term analyses across India by tracking several thousands of observational records of the last 10 years (2012-22), together with research experts from the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry (Germany), University of Exeter (United Kingdom) and National Remote Sensing Centre (India).Pillai said this newly demonstrated system also benefits from the recently available radiance observations from multiple satellite instruments, including the TROPOMI instrument onboard the Sentinel-2 satellite.She said the method is more sensitive to detecting changes in ecosystem responses widely across the country than the commonly employed global methods that lack sufficient in-situ carbon measurements.""By integrating interdisciplinary national and international expertise, IISER-B research focuses on uncovering the complex ecosystem processes that govern carbon sequestration and their resilience to climate extremes,"" Pillai said.","Green vegetation absorbs carbon dioxide (co2) from the atmosphere through photosynthesis and releases it back into the air through respiration.

Culture push at AOI as Maharashtra minister announces new art award,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/culture-push-at-aoi-as-maharashtra-minister-announces-new-art-award/articleshow/118311062.cms,"(File photo)

The fourth edition of TOI's Art of India (AOI) opened on a heartening note with Maharashtra's cultural minister Ashish Shelar announcing the launch of MAHARA - Maharashtra Art Recognition Award - as the state's commitment to its rich artistic heritage. ""Starting this year, MAHARA will honour outstanding contributions in the field of art and craftsmanship,"" said Ashish Shelar, who also unveiled another ambitious initiative - WAVES - World Audio Visual Entertainment Summit , set to take place in Mumbai from May 1 to 4. ""Just as Davos hosts the World Economic Forum, this summit will bring together global leaders in art, culture, music, film, and storytelling to showcase India's artistic and creative potential,"" he declared, adding that Prime Minister Narendra Modi, along with several international guests, will be attending the event.In another major push for the arts, he reiterated Maharashtra's partnership with the central government to establish the Indian Institute for Creative Technology (IICT) on a 10-acre plot in Goregaon's Film City. ""This centre of excellence will bring together artists, sculptors, craftsmen, filmmakers, and content creators under one roof. India produces some of the finest creative work in the world, and we must recognise its potential.""Following AOI's grand success in Delhi, these major cultural commitments set the stage for its Mumbai edition, reaffirming the platform's role in celebrating and acknowledging the country's creative community.The Mumbai edition of the exhibition, inaugurated by industrialist Ajay Piramal, cultural minister Ashish Shelar, author Shobhaa De, CSMVS director Sabyasachi Mukherjee, showcased a striking mix of masterpieces featuring legendary names, emerging voices, and under-represented artists. This edition of AOI also highlights India's rich miniature styles and folk traditions.Piramal made a strong case for expanding institutional support for the arts. ""I feel that exhibitions like this will only help in bringing art to more and more people and encourage them,"" he said, pointing out how art should transcend social and educational boundaries. ""Art is for everyone. You don't have to be highly educated or part of the elite to appreciate it. If you look at the history of India's great masters, they came from humble backgrounds but made a name for themselves across the world,"" said Piramal, welcoming the growing international interest in Indian art. ""Indian art is finally being recognised abroad, but when you compare its market value to its beauty and skill, there's still a gap,"" he said, stressing on the need to not just celebrate Indian art but ensure it gets the recognition and the price it truly deserves.Describing AOI's fourth edition as a ""big, big moment for Mumbai, and, in fact, for India"", De said, ""What is special is the inclusivity, diversity and gender fluidity that's represented so equally. And to see our folk and tribal artists receive exactly the same kind of platform as some of our great masters, it democratises art. And that's what art should be about.""Shanti Ekambaram, Kotak Mahindra Banking board member, dwelled on the deeper essence of art beyond its visual appeal. Quoting Amrita Sher-Gil, she reflected on the personal connection artists have with their homeland: ""I can only paint in India. Europe belongs to Picasso, to Matisse. India only belongs to me."" Having taken a brief walk through the space with over 250 works by 150 renowned artists, she described it as ""some of India's most exclusive, breathtaking artwork,""Besides its aesthetic value, Ekambaram highlighted its appeal as an investment. Citing data from the 2024 Hurun India Art List, she said, ""I come from the money world, so you know, I can talk about money and how art is really valuable. The sales by the top 50 artists reached more than Rs 300 crore in 2024, a 19% increase over the previous year. A lot of the artists are seeing an increase in their value,"" she said.About how one should go about buying art, AOI curator Alka Pande had these wise words. ""Let art speak to you. Let it make you pause, reflect, and see the world differently. Because that's what art does-it reminds us of our shared humanity and our endless capacity to hope for a better future.""For some, art is restorative; for others, it can be resistance or even an antidote in times of chaos. But while it means different things to different people, it does have a magnetic power. Its draw was visible at AOI, which attracted not only the cultural fraternity but some of the country's best legal and corporate minds. Among those who attended were Sonjoy Chatterjee, chairman and CEO of Goldman Sachs; Anant Goenka, executive director of Indian Express; top criminal lawyer Amit Desai; and Shishir Mehta, co-head, India Practice at global law firm Ashurst.",The fourth edition of toi's art of india (aoi) opened on a heartening note.

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi Sunday urged bankers to ensure adequate credit flow to the textiles sector to help the industry meet the growing demand from India and also asked representatives from the sector to act as ambassadors to tap overseas investors looking to set up shop in the country, amid heightened interest.""During my interaction at the stalls, I heard a pleasant complaint. People said there is so much demand that they are unable to meet it. Some friends told me that it takes an average investment of Rs 75-80 crore to set up a factory that can employ 2,000 people. I would urge bankers to hear their demands, understand their priorities and give,"" Modi said at Bharat Tex, the premier business event for the sector.The comment comes at a time when industry representatives have also told the textiles ministry that there is a lot of demand in the wake of the developments in Bangladesh and efforts by companies to diversify the sourcing base, which is highly dependent on China. Several global companies are also in talks to step up sourcing from India.""Some friends were telling me that there are a lot of foreign companies which want to invest in India, and I would urge you to be the ambassadors for that. When you tell them, instead of the govt, they will agree,"" Modi said.He said govt is also taking steps to boost manufacturing in country and also promote textiles sector. ""We are working on long-term ideas for the textiles sector... we have taken several policy changes,"" he said, adding that several steps have been taken including in the budget to provide more credit and change the definition of MSMEs.Referring to his statement at Bharat Tex last year, the PM said, ""The vision of farm, fibre, fabric, fashion and foreign is becoming a mission for the country. This mission is opening up avenues of growth for everyone - farmers, weavers, designers and businesses. Last year, textiles and apparel exports from India grew 7%. If you cheer at 7% then what will happen to me? Next time there should be cheering when we grow 17%. We export textiles and apparel worth Rs 3 lakh crore, the target is to take it to Rs 9 lakh crore by 2030. But we may be able to achieve the target before 2030 itself.""",Pm narendra modi urged bankers to ensure adequate credit flow to the textiles sector.

Lauding India's efforts, he said it is a solar superpower reaching 100 GW in record time, putting the country on a path to meet PM Narendra Modi's ambitious 500 GW target for clean energy.""Clean energy has broken through; $2 trillion worldwide was invested just last year - climate action clearly isn't charity. Investment only reaches levels like these because of commercial and economic self-interest and India is a case in point,"" he added.Talking about the benefit of clean energy, he said ""sharing these world leading lessons through International Solar Alliance, Indian companies and more like them see huge potential and profits.

Zelnick Defends Human Creativity in GTA 6 Development Amid AI Advancements



Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick on Grand Theft Auto VI: We couldn't be more excited

""We've been using digital tools since the very beginning. I would say the interactive entertainment business is an innovator within what people call now AI.""

""I think it's worth noting, though, the genius is human. The tools may be digital, but the creative genius is human.""

The Reality of Industry Trust Issues of AI



A Pledge That Needs Action



AI is transforming the gaming sector at a fast pace, but Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick believes that human imagination is still irreplaceable. During a recent interview, he stressed that though AI tools have been employed in game development for a long time, the essence of excellent games such as GTA 6 continues to be derived from human skills. More significantly, he asserted that employees should still be compensated if AI mimics their efforts in the future.One of the largest fears about AI is that it will displace human workers or diminish the value of their work. Zelnick was adamant that Take-Two has a commitment to preserving and paying human creators a fair rate. He emphasized that if AI is using or duplicating a developer's work, those developers need to be compensated.He said,However, he made it clear that technology does not replace human talent, stating,This policy is at odds with some corporations that have not been as much in favor of human ability when confronted with AI innovation.AI has long been a mainstay in the gaming sector, assisting with pathfinding, enemy AI, and procedural generation, for example. Recent developments in generative AI have raised questions regarding its ethical deployment and implications for employment. Asked if AI is playing a role in development of GTA 6, Zelnick explained that the company has employed AI tools for years but the real innovation in games always originates from humans.Although Zelnick's statements are optimistic, the gaming community has heard those promises before—and only to watch companies subsequently care more about bottom lines than how they treat others. The very debate that's ongoing regarding AI underscores the insufficiency of legal protections that exist for creators whose work gets reused by AI. This instability leaves one guessing whether or not companies will see through their declarations of fair payment in the end.Take-Two's CEO has publicly stated that human imagination is central to quality games and needs to be safeguarded. His promise of equitable pay is welcome news, but until industry controls are robust, workers are at the mercy of AI-based job automation. It remains to be seen if Take-Two and others will actually adhere to these assurances, but at least Zelnick's words are comforting amid a changing digital environment.","Take-two interactive ceo strauss zelnick believes that human imagination is still irreplaceable.

EE warns users about rising scam risks on Valentine's Day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/ee-warns-users-about-rising-scam-risks-on-valentines-day/articleshow/118272199.cms,"Representative image

How people are exposing themselves to scams

Signs of a romance scam

Asking for money or gifts (64%)



Using urgent or emotional language (49%)



Avoiding video calls or in-person meetings (41%)



Telling a sob story to gain sympathy (31%)



Giving inconsistent answers (24%)



Evading personal questions (20%)



Making grand promises or boasting excessively (12%)



Asking overly personal questions (11%)



UK mobile network operator EE has issued an urgent warning about the dangers of sharing personal details online, particularly when dating. The mobile network provider found that many users are giving away sensitive information too easily, putting themselves at risk of scams and impersonation fraud.According to EE’s survey of 2,000 UK phone users, an alarming 93% admitted to sharing personal details over text, messaging apps, or social media. A significant number do so while chatting with new acquaintances or online dating. With Valentine's Day heightening social interactions, EE is urging people to remain cautious.""Online dating has opened exciting new options for singles, but also a novel channel for criminals hunting for new ways to defraud their victims,"" EE stated.Research shows that one in ten (11%) people currently dating have been targeted by romance scams . Even more concerning, one in five victims lost an average of £2,500 due to these fraudulent schemes.According to The Mirror, EE’s findings revealed that 65% of users shared their phone number, 51% disclosed their location and 35% provided access to their social media profile.Additionally, 345 respondents said they had noticed suspicious behaviour from someone they were messaging, while 15% had been directly asked for money.The main danger lies in trusting people who may not be who they claim to be. Fraudsters can use personal information to impersonate victims, potentially leading to identity theft and financial loss.Even non-EE customers should stay alert. Last year, during the Valentine’s period, EE recorded a sharp rise in scam texts. In February 2024 alone, the company blocked 12 million malicious messages—well above the usual monthly average of 8.9 million. The network expects similar activity this year.""Scammers are experts at preying on the vulnerable,"" warns Richard Wainer, EE’s regulatory affairs director. ""At this time of year, when social media is full of public displays of affection, it can be tempting to turn a blind eye to the red flags, but spotting them is more important than ever"", Wainer added.To help users stay safe, EE has identified key red flags to watch out for when chatting online:EE urges users to remain cautious when communicating with people they don’t know well, especially when emotions are involved. Scammers often take advantage of trust and vulnerability, making it crucial to recognise the warning signs before it’s too late.","Uk mobile network operator ee has issued an urgent warning about the dangers of sharing personal details online, particularly when dating.

Takeaways: Tesla has sued Chinese customers and journalists and won almost every time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/takeaways-tesla-has-sued-chinese-customers-and-journalists-and-won-almost-every-time/articleshow/118180992.cms,"In this photo, Zhang Yazhou sits on the roof of her damaged Tesla Model 3 with a bullhorn outside a Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou (Image credits: AP)

Tesla did not return requests for comment. Here are some key things to know about Tesla's success in China:

Media coverage of Tesla in China is constrained

BEIJING: Tesla has embraced an aggressive legal strategy in China to stifle its critics suing its own customers.That's left some Tesla owners desperate. Zhang Yazhou protested publicly that her Model 3's brakes had failed and caused an accident in 2021 that sent her parents to the hospital. Tesla said that wasn't true and sued her for defamation. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay the $1.1-trillion company more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize for her criticism.""I refuse to accept it,"" said Zhang, who appealed the verdict. ""As a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.""As concerns mount about eroding checks and balances in the US, Tesla's record in China shows how it has thrived in a system where regulators, the courts and media all answer to the ruling Communist Party.It's not common for automakers in China or elsewhere to sue their own customers. But Tesla has done so successfully in China, where Elon Musk 's company has used the courts and the patronage of a powerful leader to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.Musk has a powerful patron in China Tesla's commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China's premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping . Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China's financial capital under his watch in 2019.With Li's support, Tesla was the first foreign automaker allowed to retain complete control over its China venture. Tesla got low-interest loans, tax breaks, favorable regulatory changes and other benefits.In January 2020, Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. That year, Tesla turned an annual profit for the first time in its history and Musk was soon declared the world's richest person.Musk's ""greater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,"" said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd, an advisory firm based in Shanghai. ""He's done a good job of it in China, and he's done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.""Requests for comment to the state council, which is run by Li Qiang, went unanswered.Tesla has had an impressive winning streak in Chinese courts Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures.The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review of public court documents and Chinese media reports by The Associated Press.Tesla won all eleven cases for which AP could determine the verdicts. Two judgments are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it has also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgments in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.While some industry experts say it's generally difficult for customers to win such cases, others say it's remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.""For Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,"" said Russo, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. ""The odds are stacked against you. It's like going to the casino and winning every hand.""In a statement to AP, the Shanghai high people's court said that judgements are the result of a ""fair trial.""""It cannot be assumed that the party has received 'special protection' or 'special treatment' because of their victory,"" the court wrote.Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.""We were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,"" a tech reporter told AP.Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk's company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. PingWest had to apologize for a report that claimed Tesla's Shanghai factory was a ""sweatshop"" and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). The AP could not determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com, which drew Tesla's ire after writing about the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla.Electric vehicle giant BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors in going after car owners who suffered crashes.""Tesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,"" said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,000) after he wrote about Tesla's alleged brake failures. ""Tesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.""","Tesla's success in china has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: li qiang, the former party boss of shanghai who is now china's premier. Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it has also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118181303,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-809598,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

MUMBAI: State Bank of India (SBI) has reduced interest rates on several new retail and business loans linked to external benchmarks, following the RBI's recent repo rate cut.Home loans tied to the External Benchmark Rate (EBR), now at 8.9% (RBI repo rate of 6.25% plus a 2.65% spread), are available at 8.25% to 9.2% depending on the borrowers credit score. The home loan maxgain (overdraft) option ranges from 8.45% to 9.4%. Top-up loans are priced between 8.55% and 11.05%, while top-up (overdraft) loans range from 8.75% to 9.7%. Loans against property carry rates from 9.75% to 11.05%, and reverse mortgage loans for senior citizens are fixed at 11.3%. The YONO insta home top-up loan is offered at 9.1%. Rates vary based on the borrower's Cibil score.According to bankers, business loans are linked to the marginal cost of funds and will decline only when deposit rates fall. Last week, HDFC Bank hiked its MCLR despite the RBI rate cut.SBI's auto loans are also linked to the one-year marginal cost of funds-based lending rate (MCLR), currently at 9%, and are likely to decrease only when deposit costs decline. Standard car loans, including the SBI car loan, NRI car loan, and assured car loan scheme, range from 9.2% to 10.15%.Under the loyalty car loan scheme, rates are slightly lower at 9.15% to 10.1%, depending on the borrower's credit profile.The SBI green car loan is available at 9.1% to 10.15% for electric vehicles. Two-wheeler loans are priced between 13.35% and 14.85%, with a 0.5% concession for electric vehicles. These changes reflect SBI's strategy to offer competitive rates while promoting sustainable vehicle choices.","State bank of india (sbi) has reduced interest rates on several new retail and business loans linked to external benchmarks. Home loans tied to the external benchmark rate (ebr), now at 8.9% (rbi repo rate of 6.25% plus a 2.65% spread) top-up (overdraft) loans range from 8.75% to 9.7%.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118309907,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-39810,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

As a part of the assessment, they are required to pass a test.Recently, Wipro too sacked freshers who could not pass a similar test after their training.

MUMBAI: Market players are keeping their fingers crossed as investors are weighed down by the continuing bearish sentiment due to a combination of domestic and global factors. Continuous foreign fund selling , weakness of the rupee, the escalating tariff war that was started by the US and a not-so-good quarterly corporate results have pulled the sensex and nifty down by around 2.5% each last week. Investors do not see any positive trigger that could stop the slide.""These declines stem from concerns over US tariff policies and slowing corporate earnings, leading to widespread sell-offs, particularly in small-cap stocks,"" said Krishna Appala, senior research analyst, Capitalmind Research in a note.On Friday, while the sensex ended at 75,939 points, the nifty ended at 22,929 points. Foreign funds have been the largest sellers in the Indian market so far this year with the net outflow already over Rs 1 lakh crore, data from NSDL and BSE showed.Of the total in Feb so far, the net outflow is nearly Rs 21,300 crore. Next week's trading trend, like in the past few weeks, is expected to be determined by trading pattern by foreign fund managers, market players said.The ongoing tariff war that was started by US President Donald Trump after assuming office on Jan 21, is yet to take a definite shape. So the related uncertainties are weighing heavily on markets around the world. Till there is some stability or certainty relating to US's trade relations with its other major trading partners, investors will remain cautious and prefer to avoid 'risk on' trades, market players said.Technically too the indices are at weak positions, chartists said. ""From a technical standpoint, any decisive breakdown below the 22,800-22,700 points zone (lower band for Nifty) could trigger fresh room for 22,500-22,400 in the near period, potentially a decline of nearly 15% from the all-time high,"" said Osho Krishnan, senior analyst, technical & derivatives of Angel One.""On the flip side, a series of resistances could be seen, starting from 23,300-23,350, followed by 23,500 points.

NEW DELHI: Modi government has given priority to industry and trade as it realises business plays a key role in achieving the goal of India becoming a developed nation by 2047, said labour and employment minister Mansukh Mandaviya. The taxes they pay are used for funding welfare policies that benefit everyone, especially the poor, he said.Speaking at the ET Now Global Business Summit, Mandaviya said that since 2014 India has seen ambitious aims being set and a roadmap being devised to achieve that. ""If you have a train to catch, you must reach the station in time and be on the platform in front of your coach to board it. If you are not there, the train will arrive on its scheduled time and leave without you. That is the memory I have of 1985 when I was in school and the then PM Rajiv Gandhi spoke an India of the 21st century. But there was no road map and we missed that bus then. Preparation is key. PM Modi ensured that and now we are on right track to achieving our goals,"" Mandaviya, who is also minister for sports and youth affairs said.""Modi has given a chance to the youth - which is all they needed - with his visionary programmes including ' Make in India Startup India ' and focus of self reliance.

Bitcoin bull mania has gripped the crypto market once again. This time, in a meme coin format. Bitcoin Bull ($BTCBULL) just broke the $1 million milestone in its presale.The community-driven token is on a mission to give investors exposure to the BTC bull mania, which is hyped to touch $1 million and beyond. Whenever Bitcoin hits a major price milestone, $BTCBULL holders receive Bitcoin as a reward.BTC is one of the world’s most successful assets. It has registered an AAR (Average Annual Return) of 230%. For better context, the token has seen its value rise over 200 million percent since its beginning. However, most of the market missed out on BTC’s massive explosion over the years. $BTCBULL is here to alleviate the regret. With BTC expected to grow and expand further, from $100,000 to $250,000 and beyond $1 million, investors are optimistic. Increased media coverage, widespread adoption, and potential use in national reserves have strengthened the bullish narratives.With $BTCBULL, investors can join the Bitcoin movement at an affordable price. The platform hosts $BTCBULL and $BTC airdrops that coincide with the key price milestones of Bitcoin.True, BTC has experienced multifold growth over the years and most investors can’t afford to pay $100,000 to buy a Bitcoin. But $BTCBULL gives the community exposure to BTC’s growth at small costs.$BTCBULL has a total supply of 21 billion tokens, while BTC has a total supply of 21 million. $BTCBULL has implemented a built-in deflationary model to bring more scarcity into the tokenomics over time.The burning mechanism is designed to drive the value of the token by taking advantage of the inverse relationship between price and supply. It rewards long-term $BTCBULL investors by creating upward price pressure through increased demand.Exciting $BTCBULL airdrops or burns are activated every time $BTC hits a new price milestone. For example, when the BTC price hits $100,000 after the $BTCBULL presale sell-out, the token will make its debut exchange listing. When the Bitcoin price hits $125,000, a token burn goes live, and when it touches $150,000, a BTC airdrop will go live.Being built on the Ethereum blockchain using the EVM standard, the token is more conducive to adoption and trading than BRC-20 tokens.While BRC-20 tokens demand Bitcoin-native wallets that are complex to handle for everyday investors, Ethereum wallets offer seamless trading. Although $BTCBULL is an Ethereum token, the rewards are compatible with multichain wallets. After the presale sell-out, the token will be listed on leading crypto exchanges .With a multichain wallet, $BTCBULL holders can receive $BTC and $BTCBULL airdrop rewards. The ongoing $BTCBULL presale is also hosting a passive income program that rewards users for depositing their tokens in the contract. $BTCBULL rewards will be distributed to passive income participants throughout the presale and for the following two years.The crypto market is crowded with meme coins. Yet, there are few Bitcoin-themed meme coins. That is a shame, since both meme coins and BTC are evergreen topics. $BTCBULL cleverly combines these two and offers investors a fun and inclusive way to earn bitcoin rewards .In a market full of dog and frog coins, $BTCBULL stands out with its vibrant illustrations and bold narratives. Although it has been just days since the presale launched, the community is fast-growing. As a project that targets both Bitcoin purists and meme coin degens, $BTCBULL has a target market worth over 2 trillion dollars.$BTCBULL represents Bitcoin bullishness and cheers for BTC’s journey to $1 million through memes, reward programs, and community engagement by tapping into Bitcoin’s deep-rooted brand strength.$BTCBULL has joined forces with Best Wallet to offer a seamless presale experience.

It also imposed significant financial penalties on app store operators and internet hosting providers that continued to distribute or support TikTok.According to The New York Times, TikTok executives expressed optimism during a briefing call on Tuesday that Apple and Google would soon reinstate the app. H. Lee Justine, a TikTok creator and author who participated in the call, confirmed the statement.""They said that the administration had given them a lot of information that they wouldn't be penalized and that they were really hopeful that any day now they would put it back in the app stores,"" she said in an interview.""It makes me very hopeful that they felt that they could do this because hopefully this means that long term there's not going to be issues and this will work out,"" she added.Despite Apple and Google preventing new TikTok downloads, previously installed versions continued functioning normally on American devices.TikTok's reinstatement on app stores is a promising development, granting the company until early April to secure a buyer. This marks a dramatic turnaround—just a month ago, it faced a ban with strong bipartisan support in Congress.

Thomson Reuters wins AI copyright battle in US against Ross Intelligence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/thomson-reuters-wins-ai-copyright-battle-in-us-against-ross-intelligence/articleshow/118231116.cms,"Thomson Reuters has secured an early legal victory in the ongoing debate over fair use in AI-related copyright cases. The media and technology company sued Ross Intelligence—a now-defunct legal research firm—in 2020, alleging that it unlawfully used content from its legal platform, Westlaw, to train an AI model without authorisation.Judge Stephanos Bibas of the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled a decision on Tuesday that Ross Intelligence was not entitled to use Thomson Reuters' content under US copyright law to develop a competing platform.According to the Associated Press, Bibas, in the summary judgment, concluded that ""none of Ross's possible defenses holds water"" and ruled in Reuters' favour regarding the ""fair use"" matter.Under US law, the ""fair use"" doctrine permits limited use of copyrighted materials for purposes such as teaching, research, or creating a transformative work.In an email to WIRED, Reuters' representative Jeffrey McCoy expressed satisfaction with the verdict, stating that: “We are pleased that the court granted summary judgment in our favor and concluded that Westlaw’s editorial content created and maintained by our attorney editors, is protected by copyright and cannot be used without our consent,” he wrote. “The copying of our content was not ‘fair use.’”Reuters' victory emerges amidst an increasing number of legal challenges initiated by creators, artists and music companies against AI system developers over comparable concerns.The common thread in these legal disputes is the allegation that technology firms utilised vast collections of human-authored content to train their AI systems for generating text that mimics human writing, without seeking authorisation or offering payment to the original content creators.OpenAI and its commercial partner Microsoft are facing copyright infringement lawsuits from renowned authors, including John Grisham, Jodi Picoult, and ""Game of Thrones"" creator George R.R. Martin, as well as separate legal challenges from major media outlets such as The New York Times, the Chicago Tribune, and Mother Jones.","Thomson reuters has secured an early legal victory in the ongoing debate over fair use in ai-related copyright cases.

Profits came out to $20 billion while earnings per share reached $1.86, higher than the $1.49 that analysts surveyed by FactSet had anticipated.But the company said it expected revenue for the current quarter to be between $151 billion and 155.5 billion, lower than the $158.56 billion that analysts were expecting. The guidance anticipates ""an unusually large, unfavorable impact"" from foreign exchange rates, it said.Amazon is the biggest online shopping destination in the U.S. and has long been a beneficiary of consumer spending during the holidays. As it has done in recent years, the company in October began offering promotions intended to lure early holiday shoppers. It advertised other discounts during the three-month period, including on major sales days such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.Amazon on Thursday reported it saw $75.5 billion in revenue for its online shopping business, up 7% from the same period in 2023.Across the retail industry, holiday sales in November and December were better than expected compared with the previous year as lower inflation on holiday goods enticed shoppers to buy, according to The National Retail Federation. Online shopping also saw record sales levels, Adobe Analytics reported in January.Sales for Amazon Web services, the company's prominent cloud computing unit, rose 19% during the fourth quarter. But it fell slightly below analysts expectations.Amazon is one of the biggest players in the competitive tech race around generative artificial intelligence. Like other tech companies, it has ramped up investments in the technology and is spending billions to expand data centers that support AI and cloud computing. The company is also spending money on other equipment, including its own computer chips and those developed by Nvidia. It has also rolled out its own AI models and integrated the generative AI into other parts of its business.In the fourth quarter, Amazon reported spending $27.8 billion on property and equipment, significantly higher than the same period in 2023. Most of the spending was geared towards AI and AWS, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during a call with analysts on Thursday.""We think virtually every application that we know of today is going to be re-invented with AI inside of it,"" Jassy said. ""I think both our business, our customers and shareholders will be happy medium-to-long term that we're pursuing the capital opportunity and the business opportunity in AI.""Jassy also said during the call that Amazon, like many others, was ""impressed"" by DeepSeek, the Chinese artificial intelligence company whose chatbot recently became the most downloaded app in the U.S.Amazon's quarterly report also comes as the retail industry is absorbing a new 10% tariff President Donald Trump imposed on Chinese imports on Tuesday. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been put on hold for about a month.Trump also thew out a trade exemption that allowed low-value shipments from China to bypass duties, a loophole that had given an advantage to China-founded e-commerce firms, such as Shein and Temu.The new tariffs could benefit Amazon by increasing costs for its competitors. But it would also impact Chinese sellers who connect with American consumers on the company's shopping platform. Furthermore, it could raise prices on a recently-launched online storefront that Amazon set up to ship low-cost products directly from China. The storefront, called Amazon Haul, was Amazon's answer to Shein and Temu.Additionally, analysts from Morgan Stanley wrote in a Monday note that Amazon's first-party retail business, though which the company sells products purchased from manufacturers, has the highest exposure to the tariffs. The analysts estimate 25% of the merchandise sold through that business comes from China.","Amazon reported better-than-expected revenue and profits for the holiday shopping period.
