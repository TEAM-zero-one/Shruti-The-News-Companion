NEW DELHI: Six months after releasing world's first genome-edited rice varieties, Centre may soon approve release of genome-edited mustard which has potential to produce more oil with low pungency.Developed by Biotechnology Research and Innovation Council - National Institute of Plant Genome Research, genome-edited lines in mustard are currently being evaluated under ICAR - All India Coordinated Research Project trials. Besides rice and mustard, Indian Council of Agricultural Research has initiated genome editing in 24 field crops and 17 horticultural crops.The move will help India diversify to the gene-edited technology at a time when genetically modified (GM) technology faces opposition, preventing govt from releasing any new GM varieties beyond BT cotton - the only variety that is allowed for commercial cultivation. Genome-edited crops are different from GM crops.","Genome-edited lines in mustard are currently being evaluated under icar - all india coordinated research project trials.

What the New York Mets Gain - and Risk

The New York Mets are adjusting quickly after moving on from a player who had been part of the franchise for nearly a decade. With Brandon Nimmo now in Texas, the Mets are looking for a short-term outfield solution that keeps spending under control while maintaining roster stability.That search has led them to Max Kepler. The veteran outfielder is viewed as a practical replacement rather than a headline move. A reported one-year deal worth $7.6 million would give the Mets defensive reliability and left-handed power without limiting future flexibility.The New York Mets’ plans shifted after a rare one-for-one trade with the Texas Rangers sent Nimmo to Texas in exchange for second baseman Marcus Semien. Nimmo agreed to waive his full no-trade clause to complete the deal, ending his eight-year, $162 million run in New York.On the field, Nimmo remained productive in 2025. He played 143 games and finished with a .261 average, 23 home runs, and 82 RBIs. Still, the Mets chose to prioritize infield stability and payroll balance. Semien now fills second base, but the move left a clear opening in left field.Max Kepler became a free agent after a one-year, $10 million season with Philadelphia that was slowed by knee issues.His overall numbers dipped, but the Mets see value in his defense and underlying power metrics. In 2025, he ranked among the league’s best outfield arms and remains well-suited for corner work.A short-term deal also fits the Mets’ longer view. Top prospect Carson Benge is expected to push for a larger role soon, and Kepler would serve as a bridge rather than a blocker. The savings compared to Nimmo’s contract also leave room to pursue pitching upgrades.Max Kepler gives the Mets steady corner defense, a strong throwing arm, and power against right-handed pitching at a lower cost. His projected salary is far below Nimmo’s annual average, which helps keep the luxury tax in check.The concern is durability and age. Kepler is entering his mid-30s and coming off a down year. He also does not solve the center-field question long term, which leaves the Mets relying on internal options.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Detroit Tigers predicted to chase $6.25 million Minnesota Twins star to address center field and bolster squad Even with those risks, the move fits the moment.

Matt Hardy’s wrestling career and long-term earnings

Reby Sky’s media work, business ventures, and lifestyle

Matt Hardy continues to stand as one of professional wrestling’s most recognizable figures due to his career spanning over multiple eras and multiple promotions. Whether it was his rise as part of The Hardy Boyz or the re-inventions that kept him relevant long into his forties, Hardy has long known how to capitalize on his name. As of the year 2025, wrestling contracts, merchandise, licensing, and digital appearances remain the basis of the wealth he created.That foundation is complemented by the streams of income brought in by Reby Sky, legally Rebecca Hardy. With a modeling/television/online media career that came before and through wrestling (and continues to exist), she has become a brand unto herself outside the ring. Considering how standalone earnings will translate into 2025, most industry watchers put them in a single net worth window of $3 million to $6 million apiece, depending on how private assets and ongoing business income are counted.The key to Matt Hardy’s wealth is immortality. It's hard for many wrestlers to stay active and stay relevant as we see three decades pass, but Hardy has done just that. It led to big WWE contracts, lengthy stints in Impact Wrestling, and, eventually, every so often, a return to major promotions for consistent paydays at multiple points in his career.In addition to base salaries, Hardy experienced the upsides of merchandise royalties, pay-per-view bonuses, and foreign tours.Well into his later career, his ability to reinvent himself, often through character-driven storylines, maintained the demand for appearances and allowed him to remain a commercially viable brand long after many peers quietly exited the scene.Most of Reby Sky's contribution to the couple's net worth comes outside of the ring. From her modeling career, television exposure, and powerful presence on social media platforms, she brings in advertising and partnership revenue. Working with brands and on her own media projects has given her ongoing revenue.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Hardy and Sky share a lifestyle somewhere in the ballpark upper end of upper-middle-class; no one is reading about them in that section of the N.Y. Times, but they are investing in property, content, and long-term brand value. Though numbers are not publicly disclosed, 2025 saw their fortunes aligned, reflecting decades of diversified revenue streams, pages from similar playbooks on how to monetize notoriety, and years of incremental shifts from full-time wrestling to extended entertainment and continuing digital business interests.Also Read: Who is Jodi Lynn Calaway?

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon musk has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

Quinton Rampage Jackson gifts son Elijah Jackson a rare Audi R8 after keeping childhood promise

Quinton Rampage Jackson made Christmas very special this year. The former UFC light heavyweight champion surprised his youngest son with a gift many people only dream about. Just days before Christmas, Jackson shared that he spent about $275,000 on a car for his son, Elijah “Rampage” Jackson. This was not a last-minute idea. Jackson said it was a promise he made when his son was very young. Years later, he finally kept that promise.The moment quickly went viral after Jackson posted it on X. Fans saw a proud father and a shocked son sharing a quiet but powerful moment together. The gift stood out not just because of the price, but because of the meaning behind it. Jackson did not buy something for himself. He chose to reward his son and celebrate family during the holidays. That message made the story travel fast across social media.Jackson revealed the surprise on X, where he posted a video from his garage. In the clip, Elijah Jackson walks in and sees a black Audi R8 waiting for him. He pauses, clearly stunned, and asks if the car is really his.Jackson replies with a calm smile and says, “Like I promised you when you were a kid.” He then reminds his son to drive carefully, warning him that the car is very fast.After that, he hands over the keys.The Audi R8 is one of the brand’s top sports cars. It comes with a V10 engine and a carbon-fiber body. According to Edmunds, newer Audi R8 models can cost up to $275,000, depending on features. Older versions can be cheaper, but Jackson did not share the exact model.Audi officially ended R8 production in March 2024, as confirmed by Audi. That has made existing models more valuable among car lovers.Jackson shares Elijah with his former wife, Yuki Imoto. He is also a father to other children, including daughter Naname Nakia Jackson. Still, this moment was fully about a father and son.Later, Jackson also spoke about his income today. During a livestream, he said streaming has paid him more than fighting ever did. “I have been streaming for eight months, and I made more than I did in my fighting career,” he said. He added that sponsors support him more now because more people watch his streams.Quinton Rampage Jackson streams travel videos, home life clips, and content with other creators. He also shared that having two kids in college pushed him to focus on streaming full-time.

Ex-Rockstar developer has a GTA 6 warning: ‘If the game is delayed again…',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/gaming/ex-rockstar-developer-has-a-gta-6-warning-if-the-game-is-delayed-again/articleshow/126189019.cms,"Former Rockstar developer Mike York warns that further delays to Grand Theft Auto 6 could significantly diminish public interest. He believes Rockstar is prioritizing polish to meet high expectations, but prolonged waits risk alienating fans. York anticipates a November 2026 release, citing it as an optimal period for sales.

“We’ve been waiting so long for

GTA 6

already that if there was to be another delay, people will probably stop caring about its release even more. If

Rockstar

Games delay GTA 6 again then the hype around the game will die down almost completely. Right now, nobody is searching for GTA 6. Everyone knows there’s no news, there’s nothing to talk about… There’s a point to where you delay something so much that you start to make people angry.”

“People aren’t itching to find new details or a latest leak anymore, they’re over it. They are thinking, ‘it will come out when it comes out’, as they’re so burnt out from thinking it will come out soon and then it doesn’t… And then they’re like, ‘OK, whatever…’”

Why Ex-Rockstar developer thinks Rockstar has been delaying the game

“If I know Rockstar Games, and I know the guys over there, one of the reasons for the delay in releasing GTA 6 is because they’re trying to make it look as best as it can possibly be. They’re polishing stuff.

I don’t think they’re completely finished with the game, given how much is on the line and how big everyone’s expectations are for it.”

“I think the game will be released in November 2026 as it’s a good time for the game to come out for Rockstar for multiple reasons to sell video games. If you want to sell a big amount of video games then that’s the perfect time for GTA 6 to come out with it being a month before Christmas. Usually companies only delay these things once or twice when they need to, so I think it will come out around that time,”





Former Rockstar Games developer Mike York has a critical warning for the Take-Two-owned gaming studio. He has warned that the hype and public interest around Grand Theft Auto 6 will “die down” almost completely if the game faces any more delays. In an interview with Esports Insider (as seen by Dexerto), York said:York cited fan reactions showing growing frustration, with some saying they “don’t even care anymore” because repeated delays keep letting them down.he added.The game’s delay from May to November 2026 even caused anger in Poland’s parliament, with an opposition lawmaker calling the postponement “a huge scandal” during a session.Explaining Rockstar’s reason behind GTA 6 delay, York said:York believes Rockstar is aiming to meet very high internal standards and may not feel it has reached that level yet.York noted.Till date, Rockstar has released two official trailers of the highly anticiapted game which have confirmed that GTA 6 is set in a modern Vice City. The game will feature dual protagonists, deeper RPG systems, realistic physics, new heist tools and a more evolving open world.","Former rockstar developer mike york warns that further delays to grand theft auto 6 could significantly diminish public interest.

‘Call of Duty’ Creator Vince Zampella Dies In Horrific Highway Crash Caught On Camera

Gaming community mourns visionary Developer who shaped modern shooters





Vince Zampella, the gaming industry titan behind the blockbuster Call of Duty franchise and leader of the Battlefield series, died Sunday in a single-vehicle crash on Angeles Crest Highway near Los Angeles. He was 55. The Ferrari he was driving veered off the winding mountain road around 12:45 p.m., struck a concrete barrier, and caught fire, according to California Highway Patrol reports. A passenger in the vehicle was ejected and later died at a hospital. Authorities have not confirmed whether alcohol or drugs were factors in the crash.Zampella's career defined modern military shooters.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s joinery from Manipal





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him. The IIT rejection redirected his life towards a path only few could have imagined and which eventually led him to become the CEO of Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable companies. Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software. Nadella further added that like many of friends he also viewed IIT as the pinnacle of academic achievement. But when he failed to secure admission, Nadella faced a setback that could have easily defined his future. Instead, it became the catalyst for a different journey.Nadella described IIT as “the holy grail” for middle-class students, acknowledging the weight of expectations. Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there. However, all these experiences helped him in building adaptability which later went ahead and defined his leadership style.Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992, after working at Sun Microsystems. Over, the next two decade he rose steadily through the ranks and the became the Microsoft CEO in 2014. When Nadella became the CEO, the company was facing a lot competition from Apple, Google and Amazon. However, under his leadership, Microsoft reinvented itself and it now a market valuation of $3.54 trillion.Nadella has often said that “only in America would someone like me get the chance to prove himself rather than be typecast based on the school I attended.”","Microsoft ceo satya nadella once shared his experience of how not going to iit which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him.

Alexandr Wang is reportedly clashing with Meta’s old guard

Meta’s Secret AI Army: Top Talent Hired from OpenAI, Google & More

Alexandr Wang memo on Meta's massive AI restructure





In June this year, Facebook-parent Meta Platforms agreed to take a 49% stake in artificial intelligence (AI) startup Scale AI for $14.8 billion. As part of the deal, Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang took top position inside Meta, leading the company's new “superintelligence” lab, , Meta Superintelligence Labs, or MSL. The 28-year-old founder of Scale AI, Wang has been installed as the public face of Zuckerberg’s AI reboot. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly paid billions to bring billionaire AI prodigy Alexandr Wang on board. However, it reportedly seems that all is not well between the AI wunderkind and his Boss, Mark Zuckerberg. The 41-year-old Zuckerberg is said to have backed his new hires with nine-figure compensation packages to lure top researchers from rivals, igniting a Silicon Valley poaching war.According to a report in Financial Times, Wang privately believes that CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s micromanagement of the company’s AI push is ""suffocating"". Wang is said to have complained to associates that Zuckerberg’s tight grip on the effort is stifling progress, the report said, citing multiple people familiar with the situation. Report adds that cracks have begun to emerge at an executive level and that tensions have been bubbling between Wang and Zuckerberg for sometime now.As per the report, internally, some staff question whether Wang is out of his depth, given his lack of experience managing teams in a large corporation but also his expertise in AI data services rather than as an AI researcher pushing technical breakthroughs.Incidentally, Alexander Wang’s arrival at Meta has created friction over the company's fundamental approach to AI development, with his superintelligence team pushing to make the company’s next model “closed” — keeping its technology secret. This is said to mark a major departure from Meta’s longtime philosophy of open-sourcing its models for other developers to build upon, causing some old guard members to chafe at the change, the Times reported.The new leadership has chosen to abandon Meta’s previous frontier model called Behemoth, which saw its release delayed last spring after disappointing performance tests. Meta’s AI division faces a dramatic four-way split as Meta reorganizes into groups focused on research, superintelligence development, products, and infrastructure, according to the report.As the new vision and leadership have crystallised, some top names have left. Among them, in recent weeks, Meta’s longtime chief legal officer Jennifer Newstead was poached by arch-rival Apple, while chief revenue officer John Hegeman announced he too was leaving to launch a start-up.Similarly, chief AI scientist and Turing Award winner Yann LeCun is departing Meta to launch a new AI initiative. He had reportedly taken exception at having to report to Wang. Another reason cited for his resignation is that his longer-term research was reportedly hit hard by the recent cuts announced at Meta.Meta reorganized its AI teams in June this year. The memo said that most team leaders will report directly to 28-year-old Wang. This included investor and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, who heads MSL's product team and was announced as an MSL leader alongside Wang in June. In the email sent to employees, Wang wrote that ""superintelligence is coming,"" and to ""take it seriously,"" Meta needs to make major changes. This includes establishing four distinct teams that focus on research, training, products, and infrastructure.The reorganisation is the latest in a series of AI reorgs for Meta. Incidentally, Meta had already dissolved two major AI teams in the past six months.",Alexandr wang is reportedly clashing with meta’s old guard.

Apple's Secret 3-Year Plan: A New iPhone Era is Coming!

iPhone Fold expected design and features



iPhone Fold expected price







Apple is expected to launch its first foldable smartphone next year. Now, the long-rumoured foldable iPhone from Apple has appeared in newly leaked renders offering a clear look at the design of first foldable iPhone. As per the YouTube channel Front Page Tech and popular tipper Ice Universe, the design of Apple’s first foldable iPhone may resemble to Google’s Pixel Fold. As per the images leaked online, the yet-to-launch foldable iPhone is said to feature a book-style foldable design.As per the leaks, the upcoming foldable iPhone is said to feature a large internal display and a smaller cover screen. The renders also highlight a minimal crease along with fold area where rival devices like Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold have often drawn criticism. The design appears to prioritize durability and a seamless viewing experience, aligning with Apple’s reputation for premium hardware aesthetics.“The comparison of the design of the Samsung Galaxy Wide Fold and the Apple iPhone Fold is almost identical, with the only difference being the R-angle. Samsung is more square, while Apple is more rounded. Do you prefer the square one or the rounder one?,” wrote Ice Universe.Early leaks suggest that the first foldable iPhone may look and function differently from the current iPhone lineup. It is expected that the foldable iPhone may ditch the Face ID in order to accommodate the thinner foldable design. It is also said that the company may include a 24MP under-display selfie camera which will offer a cleaner and uninterrupted look to the display. The is also tipped that the foldable iPhone may feature another 24MP camera on the cover display making it easier for the users to take selfies or answer video calls.On the back, the foldable iPhone may feature a dual-lens setup with two 48MP sensors — one standard and one ultrawide — but no telephoto lens. This simplified camera system seems to be a design trade-off to maintain the slim build that a foldable phone requires. While the camera specs may sound modest compared to Apple’s Pro models, the focus for this device appears to be on delivering a sleek design, new display technology, and the flexibility of a foldable form factor.Multiple online rumours suggest that the upcoming Foldable iPhone may be priced around $2,399.","The long-rumoured foldable iphone from apple has appeared in newly leaked renders.

Gemini's user growth and image generation capabilities have challenged ChatGPT's dominance, leading to a significant shift in the AI landscape. Woodward's ability to cut through bureaucracy and his team's innovative approach are credited for Google's AI resurgence, impacting Alphabet's stock and OpenAI's strategic plans.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

The numbers tell a brutal story for ChatGPT

The secret weapon: Breaking Google's legendary bureaucracy





Josh Woodward isn't a household name in Silicon Valley, but the 42-year-old Google veteran has accomplished what seemed impossible just months ago—he's made the world's most powerful AI company sweat. The executive leading Google's Gemini app triggered such alarm at OpenAI that CEO Sam Altman declared an internal ""code red"" in early December, forcing the startup to abandon lucrative projects and scramble to defend its eroding market position.Woodward's impact has been devastating for OpenAI. Since taking charge of the Gemini app in April while simultaneously running Google Labs, he's orchestrated a comeback that's transformed Google from AI afterthought to existential threat. His team's viral Nano Banana image generator crashed Google's own infrastructure in August, generating so much traffic that the company's custom AI chips nearly ""melted,"" according to CNBC reports from a November all-hands meeting.Google's resurgence under Woodward's leadership has fundamentally rewritten the competitive landscape. Gemini's monthly active users grew from 350 million in March to 650 million by October, coming close to ChatGPT's 800 million weekly users. By September, Gemini had dethroned ChatGPT atop Apple's App Store after generating 5 billion images.The impact runs deeper than raw user counts. Data from Similarweb reveals that Gemini has more than tripled its share of generative AI web traffic over the past 12 months, surging from 5.4% to 18.2%.This gain came directly at ChatGPT's expense—OpenAI's flagship product plummeted from commanding 87.2% market share to just 68%, a staggering 19-point drop.The blow came in late November when Google announced Gemini 3, a LLM model that outperformed OpenAI's flagship products on industry benchmarks and sent Alphabet's stock soaring. Within days, Altman issued his ""code red"" memo, delaying OpenAI's planned advertising business, e-commerce expansion, and AI agent development to pour resources into improving ChatGPT's core experience. The desperation was palpable—this was OpenAI's most decisive admission yet of the competitive pressure threatening its $500 billion valuation.Woodward's success stems from an unusual talent in Google's notoriously slow-moving culture. Colleagues told CNBC he's mastered the art of demolishing bureaucratic barriers through systems like ""block,"" where employees flag roadblocks for his team to immediately resolve. Former Google Labs co-lead Clay Bavor says Woodward's ability to ""move fast, break down barriers and execute"" has landed him ""right at the center of the most important work at Google. ""His track record speaks volumes. NotebookLM became an instant hit after its July 2023 launch. His quarterly newsletter grew so influential that Google executives routinely seek his reading recommendations. He responds directly to user complaints on X and Reddit, bringing feedback to engineers for rapid fixes—a level of user engagement that's helped Gemini gain trust and momentum.OpenAI fired back earlier this month with GPT-5.2, claiming benchmark superiority once again. But Woodward holds structural advantages that terrify OpenAI: Google's massive cash reserves, custom AI chips, and nine products with over 1 billion users each. While OpenAI burns through funding rounds to survive, Woodward's operation runs on profits from YouTube and search. Alphabet's 62% stock surge in 2025 outpaced all megacap peers—a dramatic reversal from its brutal first quarter that vindicated Woodward's strategy.","Google's josh woodward has jolted openai, forcing a 'code red' with his gemini app's rapid success.

Australia Enforces World’s First Under-16 Social Media Ban, Sparks Global Debate| Global Pulse





LONDON: A frustrated father in Spain, whose teenage daughter regularly sidesteps parental controls that block social media, wants the government to ban apps like TikTok and Instagram for children. In France, a mother of three worries about social media's effect on young people and will not give her children smartphones until they are 15. But she is sceptical a government prohibition is the answer. A mother in Chile says it is a parent's job, not government's, to teach children how to use social media responsibly.Since Australia this month barred children under 16 from using social media, parents around the world have been debating whether similarly tough action is needed in their own countries. In Australia, surveys show most parents support the new rules, while young teenagers have talked about using VPNs and other workarounds. Several countries are weighing whether to adopt similar laws.Malaysia has announced plans to bar children under 16 from using social media starting 2026. Denmark could impose Europe's toughest restrictions, though the measures would not go as far as Australia's. In the US, several states have passed laws to restrict children's social media use.Many parents said they were aware of the impact of smartphones on their own lives, and wanted to protect their children from the most harmful effects. But many also said they felt as if they were fighting a losing battle and were worn down by the time, arguments and technological know-how needed to keep their digitally savvy kids off social media. Parents who feel that way welcomed government action.Israel Perez, a designer in Barcelona, said his 14-year-old daughter was constantly pestering him to lift the restrictions he has imposed on her social media use. He said an Australia-like law would give parents more support in pushing back against such an online culture. ""I really see it as necessary, not as a drastic or excessive measure,"" he said.In Denmark, Anne Kroijer, a mother of four persuaded about three-quarters of the parents in her daughter's class not to buy smartphones for their children. They got older flip phones instead that do not have many apps or a large touch screen. ""It's so incredibly uninteresting that she forgets it half the time,"" said Kroijer. Justine Roberts, founder of Mumsnet, an online community for parents in Britain, said screen time was one of the most common topics on the site's message boards. In a poll, Mumsnet found 83% said they would back an Australia-like ban in Britain.Not all parents believe new laws are needed, and some worry about government overreach. Others see new technologies and social media as an inevitable part of children's daily lives. Charlotte Valette, a mother of three in Paris, said: ""I am not so enthusiastic about the idea of a state taking such a drastic measure."" In Kenya, a country betting on technology to bolster its economy, it will be hard to persuade parents to take away their children's smartphones, said Calvin Odera, a social worker in Nairobi, the capital.In Germany, a yearlong review of a petition brought by parents to parliament calling for an age limit on social media use showed opinion was split. One respondent wrote: ""So, you're supposed to register on social media with a digital ID card now, or some other method to verify your actual age?... The clock can't be turned back."" Verena Holler was one of the parents supporting the petition. ""It's a global crisis.""","Australia this month barred children under 16 from using social media.
