NEW DELHI: The health ministry has issued a warning against prolonged use of earphones and headphones, suggesting that these devices, whether wired or wireless, should not be used for more than two hours daily. If used for this duration, frequent breaks should be taken during listening sessions.In a letter to all states/UTs for further dissemination to the public, director general of health services Dr Atul Goel said recent studies have shown prolonged and excessive exposure to loud music and other sounds through personal audio devices can lead to irreversible hearing damage. ""Evidence has shown there is a temporary shift of hearing acuity (ability to hear and distinguish sounds) after prolonged use of an earphone/headphone or ear plug, which is generally a high-frequency hearing loss that is not easily noticeable in day-to-day life,"" he said.""If unsafe use of earphones/headphones/earplugs is prolonged and persistent, this shift of hearing acuity can be permanent and result in permanent hearing loss. Certain individuals may also develop a persistent ear ringing or buzzing noise called tinnitus because of prolonged unsafe use,"" the senior official said.The young population, Goel said, is at a higher risk due to unsafe listening practices. The rise of online gaming culture is also putting children at risk of exposure to the impulse of high decibel sounds, he added.""Once hearing is permanently impaired, normal hearing will never be restored by hearing aids or cochlear implants. Further, persistent tinnitus from a young age can lead to diverse psychological issues including but not limited to depression,"" he added.","The health ministry has issued a warning against prolonged use of earphones and headphones.

Donald Trump links 'Gold Card' program to retaining foreign graduates from India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/donald-trump-links-gold-card-program-to-retaining-foreign-graduates-from-india/articleshow/118609094.cms,"TOI correspondent from Washington:

Offering sketchy details and dodgy numbers, President Donald Trump has said American companies could invest in students from India and other foreign countries who graduate from US colleges to enable them obtain the proposed ""gold cards"" so that talent is retained in the US.A day after he floated the idea of a Gold Card, which he described as a Green Card plus that could lead to American citizenship for foreigners investing $5 million in the US, Trump expanded the idea to include foreign students graduating from US universities, saying under the current system too many of them were forced to return home, particularly to India, to become successful and wealthy there after studying in the US.""Look, I've had the complaints from a lot of companies, where they go out to hire people, and they can't hire them out of colleges. And you know what they do? They go back to India, or they go back to their country...they open up a company, and they they become billionaires,"" Trump said at a cabinet meeting.He then offered a vague, disjointed idea of companies like Apple going to campuses and spending $5 million to hire five of them, ""sort of like paying an athlete a bonus."" It was not clear why the companies would invest $1 million on graduating students (when they are paid below market salaries, according to Trump's MAGA tech bros) and how this would result in them getting a gold card, which the President earlier said would be sold to foreigners who invest $5 million in the US.The US President is prone to making fantastic claims and wild projections untethered to reality, and not delivering on many of his promises, notably his pledge to replace Obamacare with a better plan which did not happen in the four years of his first term although he promised it would happen in days. Many of his ""Day One' pledges remain unfulfilled, including deporting millions of illegal immigrants, amid disquiet about slow movement on that front.In the case of the so-called ""Gold Card"" too Trump promised it would be introduced in about two weeks, throwing out implausible numbers.""We're going to call it the gold card, and I think it's going to be very treasured. We're going to start selling hopefully in about two weeks. Now, just so you understand, if we sell a million that's $5 trillion. If we sell 10 million, which is possible, 10 million highly productive people coming in, or people that we're going to make productive, they'll be young, but they're talented, like a talented athlete. That's $50 trillion that means our debt is totally paid off, and we have $15 trillion above that,"" Trump said.He briefly expressed some self-doubt, saying ""I don't know that we're going to sell that many...maybe we won't sell many at all,"" before asserting ""but I think we're going to sell a lot, because I think there really is a thirst. No other country can do this. Because people don't want to go to other countries. They want to come here. Everybody wants to come here, especially since November 5,"" when he was elected.Trump's Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick offered a more sober appraisal, saying there were more than 250,000 investors in line for the EB-5 visa, which requires an investment of about $ 1 million, and even if 200,000 of these chose to apply for the Gold Card, it would generate $1 trillion to pay down the national debt.Even those numbers look optimistic considering the US currently offers only around 10,000 EB-5 visas annually and in many years even that quota is not filled. But Lutnick said the EB5 program was poorly administered and would be reformed to come up with the Gold Card program soon.","Us president donald trump says companies could invest in students from india and other foreign countries who graduate from us colleges.

Building a brand, one store at a time

Surviving the gymwear wars

From a grandmother’s sewing machine to a billion-dollar empire

At just 28, Ben Francis became Britain’s youngest self-made billionaire when his gymwear brand, Gymshark , skyrocketed to a $1.3 billion valuation. Now, at 32, he’s setting his sights on an even bigger conquest—New York City.Later this year, Francis will open a sprawling 13,000-square-foot Gymshark store on Bond Street, a move he sees as crucial to the brand’s global success, reported the New York Post.“I love New York … It’s the perfect place for Gymshark, and I’m honored to call it our North American home,” he told me. “We have to be successful in the US in order for us to be successful around the world.”Francis built Gymshark online in 2012, capitalizing on the rise of fitness influencers and the e-commerce boom. But now, he believes physical stores are just as important as a brand’s digital presence.His first retail venture came in 2022 with a flagship store on London’s Regent Street. Dubai followed, and in late 2024, a Gymshark pop-up landed on Wooster Street in SoHo. That temporary store’s success gave Francis the confidence to commit to a permanent NYC presence.“The city has been so supportive of our brand vision,” he said. “People can finally see and feel the product we’re so proud of … I think physical brick-and-mortar stores are actually sort of a new and different way for us to reach people.”Unlike traditional athletic apparel stores, Gymshark’s locations are designed as community hubs , featuring workout spaces, personal training sessions, and room for fitness events.The $25 billion gymwear market is fiercely competitive. While brands like Outdoor Voices and Olympia Sports have folded, giants like Nike and Lululemon battle newer players like Alo Yoga and Vuori for dominance. Gymshark, however, has carved out a loyal following with its sleek, performance-driven designs and strong influencer network.Francis credits Gymshark’s staying power to its community—one he built from scratch by sending free products to fitness YouTubers long before influencer marketing was mainstream.“When I was getting into the gym, all the people I learned the most from were online on YouTube,” he said. “When Gymshark started, we ended up sending product to a few of my heroes at the time.”Some of those influencers even received equity in the company, aligning their success with Gymshark’s meteoric rise.Francis, who grew up in England’s West Midlands, wasn’t an overnight success. He dabbled in multiple business ventures as a teen, many of which flopped. But when he started Gymshark, he had a clear vision: create gym clothes that were breathable, sweat-wicking, and odor-resistant.He learned to sew from his grandmother and stitched early orders himself. The brand’s rapid success was fueled by both its quality and Francis’ transparency—he let customers see behind the scenes of the business, building trust and loyalty.“People nowadays are interested in the story behind a brand,” he said. “They want to know who’s behind the scenes, who’s running it, and what the story is.”Now, as he brings Gymshark to the heart of New York, Francis is betting big on a future where fitness isn’t just about working out—it’s about belonging.","At just 28, ben francis became britain’s youngest self-made billionaire when his gymwear brand, gymshark, skyrocketed to a $1.3 billion valuation.

Accidental activation raises safety concerns

What affected customers should do

Health Canada has issued a warning over certain LG free-standing electric ranges due to a fire hazard caused by accidental activation of the front knobs. The advisory, posted on Wednesday, follows reports of incidents where the stovetop elements were unintentionally turned on by people or pets, reports CBS news.According to Health Canada, the issue affects more than 137,000 units sold in the country between 2016 and June 2024. As of February 12, LG Electronics Canada had received eight reports of such incidents, including two minor injuries—a cut and a burn.The affected models have five stovetop elements and control knobs positioned at the front, just above the oven door. If accidentally bumped, these knobs can turn on the heating elements, posing a fire risk.A similar recall has been issued in the United States, where approximately 500,000 units were sold between 2015 and January 2025. The US Consumer Product Safety Commission reported at least 86 cases of unintended activation, resulting in eight minor injuries and five fires, with property damage exceeding $340,000 USD. Tragically, three of these fires involved pet fatalities.Owners of the recalled models do not need to discard their stoves but should take immediate action. LG Electronics Canada advises customers to check the model number, which can be found inside the oven door or storage drawer, and compare it with the recall list.Once identified, customers should contact LG to receive a free warning label and instructions on its placement.

Policy shifts being contemplated by the Trump administration have triggered anxiety among several Indian nationals residing in the United States. Already facing decades-long green card backlogs , Indian professionals now grapple with added uncertainty and financial instability due to the proposed measures.An Indian man recently shared the ""real reason"" for leaving the United States and returning to India after ten years of stay, following social media speculation he had lost his job or faced visa issues.Aniruddha Anjana , co-founder & chief executive officer of ArcAligned, established his business in the US while working a regular job. Last year, he relocated to India accompanied by his spouse and offspring.Aniruddha shared on social media that his decision to return to India was not due to visa issues, layoffs, or concerns about immigrant uncertainty under Trump’s administration, but instead, he moved back to be closer to his elderly parents.In a post on his Instagram account, Aniruddha Anjana shared a video and wrote: ""When I last posted about returning to India after living in the US for over 10 years because my parents needed me, I received many comments assuming that I must have lost my job or faced visa issues. But the real reason was that I wanted to spend time with my parents—who sacrificed so much for me, knowing they would never ask me to return.""""This was the only reason I came back, and after a year, I can confidently say it was the best decision of my life. I have definitely added years to their lives, and to mine,"" he added.In an earlier post, he reflected on his decision to leave the United States, describing how he felt trapped in a repetitive corporate routine. He shared that the monotony was causing him to lose his sense of identity, making him feel increasingly robotic in his daily life.""I left the US after working there for 10 years because I saw the rabbit hole I was getting sucked into—the infamous corporate trap.

<p>HD Hyundai Heavy Industries plans<br></p>

HD Hyundai Heavy Industries (HHI), the giant South Korean shipbuilding company, has initiated plans to establish a shipyard in India, conducting site visits this month to explore potential locations.The delegation from the company, which holds approximately 10% of the global market share in shipbuilding, visited Thoothukudi and Cuddalore in Tamil Nadu. They also held discussions with L&T executives regarding possible collaboration. L&T operates a substantial shipyard in Kattupalli that handles shipbuilding, retrofitting and conversions.The company's interest extends beyond Tamil Nadu to other coastal states.""HD Hyundai Heavy Industries came down to India earlier this month to assess possible sites for a shipbuilding facility,"" a source familiar with the matter told ET.

""It is not just in talks with Tamil Nadu but also Andhra Pradesh and Maharashtra, who are also courting the company aggressively.""In December 2023, an Indian delegation, headed by ports and shipping ministry secretary T.K.

India is set to construct the world's longest hyperloop test facility, which will help evaluate the feasibility of commercial operations for this advanced transport system. The infrastructure, capable of achieving speeds up to 1,100 kilometres per hour, follows the successful completion of a 422-metre test track in December 2024, according to officials.""Plans are being readied for a 40–50-kilometre (km) hyperloop test track in the country. It will be supported by the Indian Railways ,"" a senior official told ET.Hyperloop represents an emerging high-speed mass transit system. Whilst operating similarly to railways, it utilises advanced technologies aimed at delivering greater efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Various technological approaches are being explored globally to create a transportation system featuring capsules supported by air-bearing surfaces within low-pressure tubes.The 422-metre vacuum tube testing facility was established through a collaborative effort between Indian Railways, L&T Constructions and Avishkar Hyperloop at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras.TuTr Hyperloop, a deep-tech venture incubated at IIT Madras, conducted India's first commercial intent hyperloop pod run on Monday. The firm has been working alongside Indian Railways to advance this technology. Additionally, an official statement indicated that Indian Railways and IIT Madras will collaborate on developing a vertical take-off landing vehicle, with funding from Indian Railways.The potential for hyperloop technology in India is substantial. As Denis Tudor, Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Co-founder at Swisspod Technologies said, ""India has a great potential for hyperloop. It is estimated that a 40-kilometre test track would cost $150 -300 million upon completion depending on the dimension for the project.""A significant collaboration emerged when Tudor's Swiss-American enterprise and TuTr from India entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) in March 2022. Both Swiss and Indian governments supported this partnership. Notably, Swisspod receives backing from Elon Musk, who serves as Senior Advisor to US President Donald Trump.The initial concept of the Hyperloop System originated from Swiss Professor Marcel Juffer during the 1970s. Subsequently, Swissmetro SA was established in 1992 to advance this innovation, though the company ceased operations in 2009.In Nevada, Virgin Hyperloop continues its system testing programme. The company has now prioritised freight transport applications, considering the complexities in passenger certification. Simultaneously, Canadian firm TransPod is developing a test facility to verify their distinctive propulsion and levitation mechanism.

Health insurers mop up Rs 1 lakh crore in FY25 as premium costs rise,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/health-insurers-mop-up-rs-1-lakh-crore-in-fy25-as-premium-costs-rise/articleshow/118613711.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: Health insurance premiums crossed the Rs 1-lakh-crore mark in the first 10 months of the current financial year, marking a 10% increase from Rs 90,785 crore mopped up in the same period last year. However, growth has slowed compared to the previous fiscal year when premiums grew 20%.Total health insurance premiums for FY24 stood at Rs 1.07 lakh crore. In FY25, the premiums reached Rs 1 lakh crore in Jan 2025, data reported by non-life insurers showed. Individual health segment recorded the fastest growth, expanding by 13.5% to Rs 37,068 crore, accounting for 38% of the total. Group health insurance, primarily purchased by companies for employees, remained the dominant category with a 53% share. Premiums in this segment rose by 12.4% to Rs 47,312 crore.In contrast, premiums from govt-backed schemes, including Ayushman Bharat Yojana , declined by 9.7% to Rs 8,828 crore. Under the scheme, state govts either purchase insurance or establish trusts to settle claims.In FY24, all three segments - govt schemes, group insurance, and individual policies - had registered double-digit growth. This year, total premium growth has moderated to 10.4%, with some policyholders seeing increases exceeding 10% following rate revisions by insurers.The rising cost of health insurance has also raised concerns about reach. Last year, despite a 20% increase in premiums, the number of individuals covered under personal health policies grew by just 5%, broadly tracking workforce expansion. Affordability remains a key issue.The sharp jump in premiums under individual policies have increased calls for waiver of 18% GST on health insurance premium. In addition to the increase in rates, insurers have been pushing individuals to take higher sum assured on the grounds of medical inflation. While a decade ago, the standard mediclaim was a Rs 3-lakh-cover, most insurers now suggest Rs 5 lakh.Besides high claims ratio in group policies, another reason for the increase in the cost of cover is the expansion in its scope. Many policies now cover maternity costs. The regulator has also made it mandatory to include some covers that were earlier excluded.Data from Star Health and Allied Insurance, which accounts for a third of individual health policies in India, show a decline in the retail health renewal ratio from 98.2% in Dec 2023 to 94% in Dec 2024. The company also reported a 10% rise in the overall sum insured in retail health.Among insurers, New India Assurance remains the market leader, holding a 17% share of total health insurance premiums, followed by Star Health (13%) and Bajaj Allianz (7%). Standalone health insurers collectively account for nearly 30% of total premiums.","Health insurance premiums crossed the rs 1-lakh-crore mark in the first 10 months of the current financial year.
