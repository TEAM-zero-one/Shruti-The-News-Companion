NEW DELHI: Wildlife scientists while enumerating snow leopards in India during the last population assessment used a smart trick to make the elusive big cats in the high and rugged Himalayas pose in front of cameras and get their foreheads having distinctive patterns, akin to human fingerprints, photographed.They used a scent, which only had a localised effect, in luring and making a snow leopard bend down and expose its forehead to the appropriately positioned camera trap, according to a recent study that explained the methodology adopted to count the big cats, nicknamed “ghost of the mountains”.It was done by spraying a small amount of perfume just below the cameras that were deployed near their favoured scent marking rocks on high-ridge tops, said the authors of the study published last month in the open-access journal PLOS One. They added that once the curious leopards lower their heads to smell, the enumerators got their prized-unique picturesThough the snow leopard population assessment in India was done during 2019-23 and the counting figure, total 718 in India, was released last year, the scent lure method was revealed in the study by Pankaj Raina from the Ladakh wildlife protection department and co-authors, including senior wildlife scientist at the Indian national science academy, Yadvendradev V Jhala, and others from the Dehradun-based Wildlife Institute of India.""We identified individual snow leopards through their unique forehead pattern,"" said the authors while underlining that every camera trap photograph was geotagged and stamped with the time and date information in the metadata.""The photo-captured species were identified using an AI-based software programme, CaTRAT, customised to identify Himalayan species. The identified species were subsequently validated by biologists,"" they said.The counting figures, released in 2024, show the highest number, 477, of snow leopards in Ladakh out of total population of 718 in India. Among the remaining ones, 124 snow leopards are in Uttarakhand, 51 in Himachal Pradesh, 36 in Arunachal Pradesh, 21 in Sikkim and 9 in Jammu & Kashmir.Covering approximately 1.2 lakh sq km, the counting exercise was conducted using a meticulous two-step framework. The first step involved evaluating snow leopard spatial distribution while the second step involved estimation using camera traps in each identified stratified region. During the exercise, camera traps were deployed at 1,971 locations, including 956 in Ladakh.","Scientists used a scent, which only had a localised effect, in luring and making a snow leopard bend down and expose its forehead to a camera trap.

In 2025, hockey ceased to be a rink-and-score world. It now encompasses contracts, investments, and branding with goals and assistance. The Hockey League thus has flourished into a global stage, where its brightest stars are also some of the sharpest financial minds in sports. Let's now pore through the opulent lives and huge fortunes of the top five richest NHL players who turned the ice game into a golden business.Mario Lemieux is not just a hockey player; he is a business genius. In 1999, when the Pittsburgh Penguins owed him $32 million in deferred salary, Lemieux pulled off his greatest deal ever: he forgave the Penguins of the responsibility of the debt in exchange for 25% ownership. When the Penguins were sold in 2021 for $900 million, Lemieux cashed out between an estimated $200–300 million. Overall, Lemieux earned in excess of $50 million during his NHL playing career.He has a $22 million mansion in Mont-Tremblant, Quebec, with 50 rooms and a private lake. His luxury car collection is said to include a Bentley Continental GT and a Rolls-Royce Phantom. Lemieux is also on the board of directors for a Canadian sports technology company, with endorsement deals through Nike and Gatorade. He also has a vast real estate portfolio.Wayne Gretzky still has money coming in long after he retired from skating. The Great One retains an ownership stake in the Vegas Golden Knights and maintains real estate vested interests in the millions in both California and Canada. He makes millions of endorsement dollars through Rolex, Adidas, and Tim Hortons.In 2025, Gretzky released the whiskey brand ""99 Reserve,"" which has become the best-selling whiskey in North America. He lives in a $17 million estate in California and has a Mercedes S-Class and a Range Rover in his garage. Through media deals, brand ventures, and his timeless legacy, his net worth remains steady.Alexander Ovechkin stands among the highest-paid active NHL players, earning $9.5 million annually under a five-year contract. He also makes approximately $5 million annually from endorsements from such names as Nike, CCM, and Hublot. In 2025, he launched a collection for FE while securing a partnership with Venture Global Energy.Ovechkin pays for a handful of lavish homes in Virginia and Moscow, while also dumping some income into their fitness startups and real estate. Among his car collection are a Lamborghini Aventador and a Mercedes G-Wagon. (With 895 career goals, he surpassed Gretzky's record, making the mark on both the hockey and money sides of history!)Chris Chelios may be retired, but he retired financially well-off. Accumulating more than $50 million in earnings during his career turned him into a businessman with Cheli's Chili Bar and a career in television as an analyst with ESPN. He owns properties in Michigan and Malibu, and his garage is packed with a classic Corvette and a Porsche 911.The revitalization of his brand value came in 2025 through his induction into the U.S. Olympic Hall of Fame. Chelios earns endorsement deals with Coca-Cola and Warrior Hockey.Sidney Crosby finished with a 12-year contract from salary negotiations worth $104.4 million in 2025. He is currently with the Penguins as an advisory officer. Long-standing contracts with Adidas, Tim Hortons, and CCM have opened millions for Crosby.His investments stretch to Canadian real estate and a minority interest in a sports tech startup. He lives in a beautiful lakefront home in Nova Scotia and drives around in a Tesla Model X and an Audi Q7. These well-thought-out decisions have enabled him to generate long-lasting wealth on top of career earnings.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky net worth in 2025: Exploring the Great One’s business ventures and endorsements Going from record-breaking goals to corporate victories, these legends of the NHL proved that ice-cold focus could heat bank accounts.

Mitch Marner considering two‑year high‑stakes deal as free agency nears

Mitch Marner stirs trade rumors as top contenders circle

Fans are buzzing after NHL insider Pierre LeBrun, writing for The Athletic, shared that star forward Mitch Marner may opt for a short deal worth $12–13 million per year instead of a long contract. With free agency looming, this decision could shape his next move around a rising salary cap.On June 22, 2025, Pierre LeBrun dropped a bombshell: Mitch Marner, 28, could choose a two‑year deal paying $12–13 million per season. His goal? Re‑enter the free agent market when the NHL salary cap jumps to an expected $113–114 million by 2027–28.LeBrun said he’s heard this from two different NHL teams. A shorter deal gives Marner leverage later, but adds risk—he might get hurt and miss a massive payday. This route would let Marner hit free agency again at age 30, just as the cap boom kicks in .LeBrun also mentioned rookie teams ready to chase Marner. The Vegas Golden Knights, Los Angeles Kings, and Dallas Stars (a $2 billion franchise) are being linked.The Stars match the $12 million-AAV but may struggle with cap space. Still, LeBrun warned: it would be a surprise, but not impossible. If Marner skips re-signing in Toronto, these clubs could pounce.Also Read: Maple Leafs’ Mitch Marner Projected To Land Record-Breaking $14M NHL Contract Marner, who now shines in Toronto, had 102 points in 82 regular-season games during the 2024–25 NHL season: 27 goals and 75 assists. With a +18 ranking, he came third in league scoring.Toronto hasn’t reached the conference finals, and GM Brad Treliving admitted changes are needed . Marner declined a no-trade clause waiver in March and canceled his annual charity event, fueling rumors he might leave . A two-year deal would give him short-term control over his fate and net him a bigger future deal.With the July 1 free agency deadline nearing, fans wonder: will Marner bet on himself now and aim big later, or take a longer-term deal close to $14 million AAV? This bold strategy could redefine star forward contracts for the cap surge ahead.","Mitch marner, 28, could choose a two-year deal paying $12–13 million per season. His goal?

Iran has reportedly went for a near-total Internet Blackout Tuesday (June 17) as conflict with Israel deepened. According to a report by NBC News, the drop appears to be a result of a decision by Iran’s government, rather than Israeli strikes on infrastructure. The report quotes Kentinc and Netblocks, the two companies that track global internet connectivity. According to NBC News, quoting these companies, Iran’s internet connectivity plummeted around 5:30 p.m. local time, limiting Iranians’ ability to access and share information with the outside world.The internet slowdowns appeared to particularly affect services like virtual private networks (VPNs) used to access foreign sites. Data published by the internet services company Cloudflare found that two major Iranian mobile network providers were effectively disconnected.Fatemeh Mohajerani, a spokesperson for Iran’s government, reportedly said it had restricted internet access in response to Israeli cyberattacks.Iran’s government has historically shut down or reduced its internet connectivity with the outside world in times of civil unrest. In 2019, the country implemented a six-day full blackout as protesters took to the streets across the country and the government issued a crackdown on civilians, reportedly leading to the deaths of more than 100 people.Amir Rashidi, the director of digital rights and security at the Miaan Group, a nonprofit organization that advocates for human rights in Iran, reportedly said that some Western apps for communicating, including WhatsApp and Instagram have been blocked. He further said that app stores of Google and Apple -- Google Play Store and App Store -- had been blocked in Iran.A WhatsApp spokesperson told NBC News that its parent company, Meta, has been engaged in a cat-and-mouse game with Iran.Recently, in a statement to the news agency AP, WhatsApp said it was “concerned these false reports will be an excuse for our services to be blocked at a time when people need them the most.”“We do not track your precise location, we don’t keep logs of who everyone is messaging and we do not track the personal messages people are sending one another. We do not provide bulk information to any government,"" the messaging platfrom added.The report said that Iran’s National Information Network, a nationwide network of government-approved sites that are not connected to the outside world, has largely remained accessible to people in Iran. As internet services are restricted in the country, some people have called for Elon Musk’s satellite internet service provider, Starlink, to step in, the way it has in many parts of the world.","Iran reportedly went for a near-total internet blackout tuesday (june 17) as conflict with israel deepened.

Poll Do you believe that manual coding skills are essential even with the rise of AI coding tools? No, AI can do it all Yes, absolutely

Startups can't rely on ""vibe coding"" alone

GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke says the ""key for winning"" with AI coding tools is maintaining the ability to quickly modify AI-generated code manually, rather than relying entirely on automated agents. Speaking on ""The MAD Podcast with Matt Turck,"" Dohmke emphasized that developers need flexibility to seamlessly transition between AI assistance and hands-on coding.The CEO outlined an ideal workflow where AI agents can write code and submit pull requests, but developers retain the ability to make rapid changes using their existing programming skills . This approach prevents the productivity trap of spending minutes describing simple changes in natural language when the same task could be completed in seconds through direct coding.""The worst alternative is trying to figure out how to provide feedback or prompt to describe in natural language what I already know how to do in programming language,"" Dohmke explained. Such scenarios could transform three-second tasks into three-minute ordeals, ultimately reducing rather than enhancing productivity.Dohmke also addressed the trending "" vibe coding "" phenomenon, a term coined by OpenAI cofounder Andrej Karpathy to describe heavy reliance on AI for code generation. During a recent Q&A at Station F in Paris, the GitHub CEO cautioned that startups cannot scale on vibe coding alone.Non-technical founders will struggle to build sustainable companies without skilled developers, he argued, noting they ""can't build a complex system to justify the next round.""

The technology sector's brutal workforce reduction continues into 2025, with industry giants Intel, Microsoft, Panasonic, Google , and Amazon leading a wave of layoffs that has already eliminated more than 62,000 jobs in the first half of the year. From semiconductor manufacturers to social media platforms, major tech companies are restructuring operations amid economic uncertainty and shifting business priorities, leaving tens of thousands of workers searching for new opportunities in an increasingly competitive market.The layoffs span across all sectors of technology, affecting everyone from established hardware manufacturers like Intel planning to cut up to 21,700 positions to fintech companies like Block eliminating nearly 1,000 workers, streaming platforms downsizing staff, and even space companies like Blue Origin cutting over 1,000 employees. With artificial intelligence reshaping business models and companies focusing on operational efficiency, the human cost of technological transformation has become starkly apparent as some of the world's most valuable companies simultaneously invest billions in AI while eliminating traditional roles.Intel announced the most devastating single layoff in the tech industry for 2025, planning to eliminate more than 21,000 employees, representing roughly 20% of its total workforce. The semiconductor giant's cuts come ahead of its Q1 earnings call under newly appointed CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who took over from longtime chief Pat Gelsinger. Additionally, Intel plans to lay off 15% to 20% of workers in its Intel Foundry division starting in July, affecting the unit that designs, manufactures, and packages semiconductors for external clients. With Intel's total workforce at 108,900 people as of December 2024, these combined reductions represent one of the largest single-company layoffs in tech history.Japanese electronics giant Panasonic announced it would cut 10,000 jobs, affecting approximately 4% of its total workforce as part of a comprehensive restructuring plan. CEO Yuki Kusumi said the cuts are designed to better prepare the century-old company for future decades, with 5,000 job losses expected in Japan and another 5,000 overseas. The company is trimming operations in non-growth areas such as televisions and industrial products to concentrate on emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence. Kusumi addressed the severity of the decision during an earnings call, stating he was ""truly sorry"" but emphasized that drastic cost structure cuts were necessary for the company to pursue growth.Microsoft implemented a multi-phase layoff strategy throughout 2025, first cutting over 6,500 jobs in May, affecting approximately 3% of its global workforce of 228,000 employees. The Seattle-headquartered company followed this with additional layoffs affecting software engineers, product managers, technical program managers, marketers, and legal counsels. The May cuts represent one of Microsoft's biggest layoffs since it eliminated 10,000 employees in 2023, and the company is reportedly contemplating further reductions that could happen through additional phases, with discussions about reducing middle managers and non-coding staff to increase the ratio of programmers to product managers.Meta announced it would cut 5% of its staff, targeting what CEO Mark Zuckerberg described as ""low performers"" as the company prepares for ""an intense year."" With more than 72,000 employees as of its latest quarterly report, the social media giant's cuts affect approximately 3,600 workers. The layoffs began in February and hit teams overseeing Facebook, the Horizon virtual reality platform, and logistics operations hardest. Meta also conducted additional layoffs in April, eliminating over 100 employees in its Reality Labs division, which manages virtual reality and wearable technology development for Meta's Quest headsets.HP announced it would eliminate up to 2,000 jobs as part of its ""Future Now"" restructuring plan designed to save the company $300 million before the end of its fiscal year. The cuts represent a significant portion of the computer and printer manufacturer's workforce as the company seeks to streamline operations and reduce costs. The restructuring comes as HP faces ongoing challenges in the traditional PC and printing markets, with the company pivoting toward more profitable business segments and operational efficiency improvements.Google implemented several rounds of layoffs throughout 2025, cutting hundreds of employees across multiple divisions. The search giant eliminated 200 workers in its global business unit, which handles partnerships and sales, while also laying off hundreds of employees in its platforms and devices division covering Android, Pixel phones, and the Chrome browser. Additional cuts affected the People Operations and cloud organizations teams as part of a broader reorganization effort. Google offered a voluntary exit program to U.S.-based People Operations employees while restructuring to ""drive greater collaboration and expand our ability to quickly and effectively serve customers.""Amazon conducted layoffs across multiple divisions, including approximately 100 employees from its devices and services division, which encompasses the Alexa voice assistant, Echo smart speakers, Ring video doorbells, and Zoox robotaxis businesses. The e-commerce giant also laid off dozens of workers in its communications department to help the company ""move faster, increase ownership, strengthen culture, and bring teams closer to customers."" These cuts are part of Amazon's broader cost-reduction strategy, having reduced its workforce by approximately 27,000 employees since the start of 2022.Jeff Bezos's space company Blue Origin laid off about 10% of its workforce, affecting more than 1,000 employees in what represents a significant reduction in the commercial space industry. CEO David Limp said the company's priority was ""to scale manufacturing output and launch cadence with speed, decisiveness and efficiency for customers."" The layoffs particularly targeted roles in engineering, research and development, and management positions. Limp acknowledged that rapid growth in recent years had created ""more bureaucracy and less focus than needed,"" necessitating organizational changes to align with execution priorities.Cloud-based customer management software company Salesforce cut more than 1,000 jobs from its nearly 73,000-strong workforce, despite reporting strong financial performance during its third-quarter earnings. The cuts come as the company actively recruits and hires workers to sell new AI products, indicating a strategic shift rather than financial distress. Affected employees are eligible to apply for open internal roles, particularly in sales positions focused on Salesforce's artificial intelligence-powered products.Human resources software company Workday cut 8.5% of its workforce, eliminating around 1,750 employees as part of a strategic focus on artificial intelligence development. CEO Carl Eschenbach said the company would concentrate hiring in AI-related areas while expanding its global presence. The layoffs came with severance packages of at least 12 weeks of pay for affected employees. Eschenbach emphasized that ""the environment we're operating in today demands a new approach, particularly given our size and scale.""Japanese automaker Nissan announced the most severe cuts in the automotive sector, planning to eliminate 20,000 jobs by 2027 while reducing its factory operations from 17 to 10 facilities. The job losses include 9,000 layoffs announced late last year and come as the automaker faces challenges from US tariffs on imported vehicles and collapsing sales in China. Nissan reported a net loss of 671 billion yen ($4.5 billion) for the 2024 financial year and declined to issue an operating profit forecast for 2025 due to tariff uncertainty.Jack Dorsey's fintech company Block laid off nearly 1,000 employees in its second major workforce reduction in just over a year. The company, which operates Square, Afterpay, CashApp, and Tidal, eliminated 931 positions representing around 8% of its workforce. The restructuring involved transitioning nearly 200 managers into non-management roles and closing almost 800 open positions. Dorsey announced the layoffs in an internal email titled ""smaller block,"" emphasizing that the changes were not driven by financial targets or AI replacements but were part of streamlining operations.General Motors' autonomous vehicle subsidiary Cruise laid off 50% of its workforce as it prepared to shut down operations entirely. The cuts included CEO Marc Whitten and several other top executives, with the remaining portions of the company moving under General Motors' direct control. The dramatic reduction represents one of the most significant failures in the autonomous vehicle sector, eliminating hundreds of jobs as the company ceased its independent operations.Coffee giant Starbucks eliminated 1,100 corporate employees as part of a comprehensive restructuring effort led by CEO Brian Niccol. The layoffs specifically targeted corporate staff and did not affect employees working in Starbucks stores. Niccol stated in a memo that the cuts would help Starbucks ""operate more efficiently, increase accountability, reduce complexity and drive better integration."" The company implemented the layoffs to improve results after sales declined in the previous year.Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike cut approximately 500 jobs, representing 5% of its global workforce of just over 10,000 employees. CEO George Kurtz said the Austin, Texas-based company's job cuts would position it ""to move faster, operate more efficiently, and continue cybersecurity leadership."" The layoffs came as CrowdStrike works to recover from a major software bug that temporarily disabled millions of Windows PCs worldwide, costing the company between $36 million and $53 million in restructuring expenses.Match Group, owner of Tinder and Hinge, announced it would cut 13% of its approximately 2,500 full-time workers, eliminating around 325 positions. New CEO Spencer Rascoff implemented the cuts while addressing challenges in the dating app market, particularly with younger generations souring on dating platforms. The restructuring aims to remove one out of every five managers and focus on ""product velocity"" to drive growth, with Rascoff acknowledging that apps ""have felt like a numbers game rather than a place to build real connections.""Automattic, the parent company of Tumblr and WordPress, eliminated 16% of its nearly 1,500-person global workforce. CEO Matt Mullenweg said the company had reached an ""important crossroads"" with revenue growth occurring in a highly competitive market where ""technology is evolving at unprecedented levels."" The restructuring aimed to improve ""productivity, profitability, and capacity to invest"" while the company offered severance and job placement resources to affected employees.German luxury automaker Porsche announced plans to cut 3,900 jobs over the coming years as part of efficiency improvements. About 2,000 of the reductions will come from the expiration of fixed-term contractor positions, while the company will make the remaining 1,900 cuts by 2029 through natural attrition and limited hiring.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates ' daughter Phoebe Gates launched an ecommerce app earlier this year. Phoebe co-founded the e-commerce app Phia with her former Stanford roommate Sophia Kianni. The platform uses AI to help users compare prices of new and second-hand products across more than 40,000 websites. A web browser/app, Phia aims to be the Booking.com of fashion, offering an instant price comparison from thousands of e-commerce sites for any item, new or used.Phoebe Gates is the youngest child of Bill and his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates.When she told her father that she and Ms. Kianni wanted to get into the e-commerce space, his reaction, he said, was “Wow, a lot of people have tried, and there’s some big guys in there.” However, he was reportedly worried she might ask for money. In an interview published by the New York Times, soon after Phia’s web browser and app went live, Bill Gates said: “I thought, ‘Oh boy, she’s going to come and ask.”“I would have kept her on a short leash and be doing business reviews, which I would have found tricky,” the businessman explained of his hesitance. “And I probably would have been overly nice but wondered if it was the right thing to do.”Her mother Melinda Gates , who Phoebe calls her “rock,” told her she had to raise the capital on her own. “She saw it as a real opportunity for me to, like, learn and fail,” she said.Talking further about Phoebe Gates said that among all her children, she is “the most different than I am"". ""Because she’s so good with people. When we would go on family vacations, we would find some part of the beach to just be off on our own, and Phoebe would go down the beach and meet people and bring them back to introduce them to us,” Phoebe Gates explained.","Bill gates: phoebe gates is the most different than i am.

Read: Amazon CEO's full address to employees

Today, in virtually every corner of the company, we're using Generative AI to make customers lives better and easier. What started as deep conviction that every customer experience would be reinvented using AI, and that altogether new experiences we've only dreamed of would become possible, is rapidly becoming reality. Technologies like Generative AI are rare; they come about once-in-a-lifetime, and completely change what's possible for customers and businesses. So, we are investing quite expansively, and, the progress we are making is evident.

You can see it in what we're rolling out in Alexa+, our next generation

Alexa

personal assistant that's meaningfully smarter, more capable, and is the first personal assistant that can take significant actions for customers on top of providing intelligent answers to virtually any question.

You can see it with our AI shopping assistant that's being used by tens of millions of customers around the world to discover new products and make more informed purchase decisions.

You can see it in an increasing array of shopping features like ""Lens"" (very cool to be able to take a picture of an item and have it pull up the shopping result), ""Buy for Me"" (where I can ask our shopping agent to buy an item on another merchant's website for me), or Recommended Size (where we can predict the right size for you based on prior purchases and how different apparel brands run fit-wise relative to each other).

You can see it in how we're helping our independent sellers more easily create new product detail pages or get advice on how to be even more effective as a seller in our marketplace. Nearly half a million selling partners are using these services, and the listings they're creating are measurably better.

You can see it in Advertising where we've built a suite of AI tools that make it easier for brands to plan, onboard, create and optimize campaigns. In Q1 alone, over 50K advertisers used these capabilities.

And, you can see it in what we're delivering in AWS for builders, whether it's custom silicon (Trainium2) to provide better price-performance on model-training and inference, services that make it much easier to build Foundation Models (SageMaker), or leverage leading frontier models and do GenAI inference at scale (Bedrock), our own frontier model (Nova) to give customers leading intelligence at lower latency and cost, or services to make it much easier for developers to write code (Q and QCLI).

We're also using Generative AI broadly across our internal operations. In our fulfillment network, we're using AI to improve inventory placement, demand forecasting, and the efficiency of our robots—all of which have improved cost to serve and delivery speed. We've rebuilt our Customer Service Chatbot with GenAI, providing an even better experience than we'd had before. And, we're assembling more intelligent and compelling product detail pages from leveraging GenAI.

I could go on, but you get the idea.

While we've made a lot of progress, we're still at the relative beginning. There are a few reasons we believe this and want to go even faster.

First, we have strong conviction that AI agents will change how we all work and live. Think of agents as software systems that use AI to perform tasks on behalf of users or other systems. Agents let you tell them what you want (often in natural language), and do things like scour the web (and various data sources) and summarize results, engage in deep research, write code, find anomalies, highlight interesting insights, translate language and code into other variants, and automate a lot of tasks that consume our time. There will be billions of these agents, across every company and in every imaginable field. There will also be agents that routinely do things for you outside of work, from shopping to travel to daily chores and tasks. Many of these agents have yet to be built, but make no mistake, they're coming, and coming fast.

Second, and what makes this agentic future so compelling for Amazon, is that these agents are going to change the scope and speed at which we can innovate for customers. Agents will allow us to start almost everything from a more advanced starting point. We'll be able to focus less on rote work and more on thinking strategically about how to improve customer experiences and invent new ones. Agents will be teammates that we can call on at various stages of our work, and that will get wiser and more helpful with more experience. If we build and leverage the right agents, it's going to rapidly accelerate our ability to make customers lives easier and better every day, and it's going to make our jobs even more exciting and fun than they are today.

And third, we're going to keep pushing to operate like the world's largest start-up-- customer-obsessed, inventive, fast-moving, lean, scrappy, and full of missionaries trying to build something better for customers and a business that outlasts us all. You will continue to see steam and I take actions to help us move faster, have more ownership, and invent more easily. AI will be a substantial catalyst here.

Today, we have over 1,000 Generative AI services and applications in progress or built, but at our scale, that's a small fraction of what we will ultimately build. We're going to lean in further in the coming months. We're going to make it much easier to build agents, and then build (or partner) on several new agents across all of our business units and G&A areas.

As we roll out more Generative AI and agents, it should change the way our work is done. We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It's hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce as we get efficiency gains from using AI extensively across the company.

As we go through this transformation together, be curious about AI, educate yourself, attend workshops and take trainings, use and experiment with AI whenever you can, participate in your team's brainstorms to figure out how to invent for our customers more quickly and expansively, and how to get more done with scrappier teams. When I first started at Amazon in 1997 as an Assistant Product Manager, I worked on leaner teams that got a lot done quickly and where I could have substantial impact. We didn't have tools resembling anything like Generative AI, but we had broad remits, high ambition, and saw the opportunity to improve (and invent) so many customer experiences. Fast forward 28 years and the most transformative technology since the Internet is here. Those who embrace this change, become conversant in AI, help us build and improve our AI capabilities internally and deliver for customers, will be well-positioned to have high impact and help us reinvent the company.

There's so much more to come with Generative AI. I'm energized by our progress, excited about our plans ahead, and looking forward to partnering with you all as we change what's possible for our customers, partners, and how we work.

5 biggest AI announcements at Microsoft Build 2025

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy delivered a stark warning to his 1.5 million employees this week, telling them that artificial intelligence will fundamentally reshape the company's workforce in the coming years. In a company-wide memo, Jassy announced that AI agents and generative AI systems will reduce the need for human workers in many current roles.""We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today,"" Andy Jassy wrote in the June 17 memo, adding that the company expects this transformation ""will reduce our total corporate workforce"" within the next few years.

Google has reportedly put forward a new set of changes to its search results page, offering to better feature competing services in a bid to resolve a major European Union (EU) antitrust case and avoid a potentially hefty fine.Citing documents that Google sent to other companies, news agency Reuters reports that the proposal comes three months after the European Commission (EC) formally charged the tech giant with violating the landmark Digital Markets Act (DMA) by unfairly favouring its own services like Google Shopping , Hotels, and Flights over those of its rivals.Under the latest offer, Google suggests creating a dedicated box at the top of the search results page for a rival vertical search service (VSS), selected through “objective and non-discriminatory criteria.” This box would reportedly have the same format and features as Google's own offerings and would include three direct links chosen by the rival company.Other specialised search services would be ranked below this box.“We do not agree with the (Commission's) preliminary findings' position but, on a without prejudice basis, we want to find a workable solution to resolve the present proceedings,” Google said in the documents sent to rival companies, while maintaining its position.The proposal is set to be discussed at a meeting scheduled for July 8 where rivals will provide feedback to the Commission.

A children’s vest sold as ""100 per cent Australian sheepskin or wool"" has turned out to be actually made from domestic cat and rabbit fur, setting off alarm bells among animal rights groups calling for a statewide ban.The shocking discovery was confirmed through forensic testing by UK-based fibre analysis firm Microtex, which revealed that the vest, sold by fashion brand Suttons UGG at a Melbourne shopping centre—was actually made using the fur of domestic cats and rabbits, as per reports.The investigation, led by advocacy group Collective Fashion Justice in collaboration with the Animal Justice Party, also uncovered two beanies with pom-poms being sold at Queen Victoria Market, which were falsely labelled as 100% acrylic. Testing revealed they contained fox and raccoon dog fur.The findings have prompted animal welfare organisations and the Animal Justice Party to demand a complete prohibition on fur sales across the state.""Every Victorian would be shocked to know that they could go to the store and accidentally buy something made from cat fur, when they may have a cat at home themselves,"" Collective Fashion Justice founder Emma Hakansson said.In a statement to the ABC, Suttons UGG, which operates retail stores in Sydney and Melbourne, admitted the label on the vest was ""wrong.""A spokesperson said the manufacturer had described the material as a ""kind of special fur,"" but the company could not ""100 per cent confirm"" whether it included cat fur.Earlier this year, the Australian Fashion Council implemented restrictions, prohibiting fur, wild-animal skins, and wild feathers from fashion shows.In 2004, the Australian government enacted legislation prohibiting cat and dog fur imports and exports. A Consumer Affairs Victoria study in 2020 examining fur product labelling revealed inaccuracies in all independently tested items.Following these findings, warnings were issued to fur retailers.According to Sky News, Georgie Purcell, the Animal Justice Party MP representing Northern Victoria, has requested authorities to implement a complete ban on fur sales saying, ""Consumers could be out there buying this, and then going out and wearing domestic cats.""","A children's vest sold as ""100 per cent australian sheepskin or wool"" has turned out to be made from domestic cat and rabbit fur.

Indian auto industry chart magnet supply chain plans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indian-auto-industry-chart-magnet-supply-chain-plans/articleshow/122010618.cms,"NEW DELHI: As Indian auto industry faces a magnet supply crunch, following restrictions placed by China, a group of companies, including some homegrown advanced material entities, have come forward to build in-house supply chains.The companies have made presentations to govt, including the heavy industries ministry, and assured building of supplies within India to reduce dependence on China. ""The companies include Midwest Advanced Materials, Entellus Industries, and public sector Indian Rare Earths (IREL),"" sources have told TOI.The sources said that heavy industries secretary Kamran Rizvi has also taken presentations from companies as govt develops strategies for indigenous capabilities in magnet production.""Midwest Advanced Materials made a presentation about their plans to produce rare earth magnets in India with a capacity of 500 tonnes per annum. They forecast that by end of 2026, they will be able to produce custom-made rare earth magnets for the industry,"" one of the sources said.Entellus, a UK-headquartered company with primary operations in India, also made a presentation to govt, detailing their plans to produce rare earth magnets.""They have told officials that their plant is ready to produce the magnetic powder but will still take some time to produce industry-grade magnets,"" the source said.IREL, which was among the last to make its presentation, informed govt that once production begins, they will be able to match China's rates. ""However, the company said that ore present in Indian geography is 100 times less than in China, the US, and Australia,"" the source said.Companies also told govt that magnet production in India was shut down over the past two decades due to proliferation of cheaper Chinese supplies. ""The industry members requested govt to support companies in setting up magnet production by providing incentives and monetary benefits,"" the source said.Secretary Rizvi told the companies to make ""realistic statements about magnet production"" as potential customers in the auto sector will suffer due to incorrect assessments. The auto industry has also requested potential local producers to provide a firm timeline on supplies, if possible, emphasising that their production line depends on quick procurement.The situation for the auto industry has deteriorated over the past few months as no Indian auto component or vehicle company has managed to get approval from the Chinese govt for procuring rare earth magnets. Also, there has been ""no clarity as yet"" on any timeline for a confirmed meeting with representatives of Chinese govt, despite intervention of Indian officials.The applications for sourcing magnets have been filed mainly by parts manufacturers who provide fully-built sophisticated component assemblies such as speedometers, electric motors, e-axles, electric water pumps, automatic transmission kits, speakers, sensors, and ignition coils (used in engines).The request for a meeting with Chinese representatives is being pursued not just by industry bodies of component makers (Auto Component Manufacturers Association) and vehicle manufacturers (Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers), but also facilitated by officials in ministries.","Indian auto industry faces a magnet supply crunch, following restrictions placed by china.

Why IPO-ready startups seek 'confidential' route,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/why-ipo-ready-startups-seek-confidential-route/articleshow/122010572.cms,"MUMBAI: Startups preparing to go public are increasingly opting for the confidential IPO filing route.After Swiggy's $1.4-billion IPO last year, filed through the confidential mode, sailed through, a clutch of firms including PhysicsWallah, Groww, Boat, and Shiprocket have taken this route. Lenskart and Meesho are also headed this way, sources said.While traditional companies such as Vishal Mega Mart have opted for this mode, and recently, Tata Capital chose to go confidential, the trend is picking up among startups that operate in a competitive market.For one, a confidential filing allows startups to keep their business metrics and performance away from the public eye. It also gives them the leeway to test the market appetite and accordingly decide on the IPO timing. Startups that are still firming up their path to profitability find this approach to be more prudent, investment bankers said.""The trend has been picked up by startups which are in very competitive businesses as it helps them to shield public disclosure of their KPIs and other sensitive business information like clients and vendors. This could also be useful in cases where issuers have a slightly longer time frame in mind for IPOs, yet want to get the regulatory clearance as Sebi observations are valid for an 18-month period in this route,"" Anurag Byas, director, equity markets solutions at Rothschild & Co, told TOI.The first batch of big startup IPOs was seen in 2021 when, fuelled by the pandemic-led surge in appetite for digital services, companies rushed to the markets to capitalise on consumer sentiment. Sebi introduced the confidential filing route in 2022.""Companies facing intense market competition prefer shorter windows for narrative battles in the public square. Less time spent on information wars is better for companies focused on frenetic growth and execution,"" said an executive at an IPO-bound startup which took the confidential route on condition of anonymity.Zepto, PhonePe, Pine Labs, and Lenskart are among a spate of startups that are eyeing a public listing. In a volatile market, the option of confidential filing becomes more favoured. ""With global rate cycles and geopolitical risks keeping equity markets volatile, startups prefer to keep their listing ambitions discreet. This route allows them to stay prepared, monitor the sentiment, and hit the market quickly when windows open up,"" said Prakash Bulusu, joint CEO at IIFL Capital.The practice of confidential filing is in place in developed jurisdictions, and the adoption in India gives issuers greater flexibility, said Kailash Soni, head of India equity capital markets at Goldman Sachs.""Companies are choosing to realign their strategies and focus on investor marketing after receiving Sebi's approval,"" said Gaurav Sood, MD & head, equity capital markets at Avendus Capital.This has helped issuers to consult with Sebi for views on regulatory issues and test waters from a valuation perspective, added Arka Mookerjee, partner at JSA.","After swiggy's $1.4-billion ipo last year, a clutch of firms including physicswallah, groww, boat, and shiprocket have taken this route.
