What is the Rolex watch seizure case

What Rolex cases means for those planning to get iPhones and other gadgets from abroad

Red Channel for passengers having dutiable goods.

The Delhi High court , in its verdict dated September 17, 2025 allowed a man to retrieve his Rolex watch seized by the customs department at the Indira Gandhi International airport after paying a fine. The case sets a new precedent, clarifying an important grey area in customs rules: Value of the imported product alone can not determine the intent.The Rolex case also has an important ‘tip/reminder’ for Indians planning to get iPhones (including the recently-launched iPhone 17 series) or laptops (Apple MacBooks and other brands) from the US, Dubai and other countries. As court said customs authorities can not automatically treat high-value items carried by passengers as commercial imports. Officials, the court underlined, must look at the circumstances of each case, including personal use. But yes, there is a certain value till which Indian nationals are allowed to bring in electronics from abroad, and the same needs to be followed. Else, these devices are liable for import duty. If not disclosed, travellers may have to pay a fine too.Mahesh, an Indian citizen and a current resident of Dubai landed at the airport on March 7, 2024, wearing his Rolex watch. He was intercepted by the Customs Officers for passing through a wrong channel for importing goods.Found in violation of the relevant provisions, the Customs department concluded that the seized Rolex watch (1 unit) is in commercial quantity and cannot possibly be for personal use. The department ordered him to redeem the Rolex watch within 120 days by paying a fine of Rs 1.8 lakh for re-export purposes.Mahesh appealed against the order in the Delhi High court. A division of Justice Prathiba M. Singh and Sahil Jain allowed Mahesh to retrieve his detained Rolex watch. But, the court also upheld the customs department’s right to impose the redemption fine.“Clearly, this Court is of the view that one Rolex watch cannot be held to be a commercial quantity and there is no reason as to why the same cannot be kept for personal use. However, considering the fact that the option of redemption was given to the Petitioner, the Petitioner (Mahesh) shall now pay the redemption fine by October 31, 2025, and redeem the detained article in accordance with the impugned order,” the court said.For the purpose of Customs clearance of arriving passengers, a two channel system has been adopted:Passengers are advised to report at the appropriate channel for Customs Clearance. However, passengers walking through the Green Channel (mistake that Mahesh did with his Rolex watch) with dutiable / prohibited goods are liable to prosecution/ penalty and confiscation of goods.If a user is planning to buy an Apple Macbook or any other laptop from abroad, the Customs rules allow one laptop computer (note book computer) under Customs Duty Free Allowances. In addition, passengers who are 18 years or older can bring one extra laptop duty-free, even beyond the normal allowance.As for iPhones, the device bought has to be for personal consumption, and cannot be more than one unit.If you are taking expensive items like a camera or projector out of India and plan to bring them back, you don’t have to pay duty again. But make sure that at the time of departure, the Customs Officer will note the details of the item (like serial number or unique marks) and give you an Export Certificate.When you return, you just need to show this certificate to Customs. They will check the item and let you carry it without charging duty.","Mahesh, an indian citizen and a current resident of dubai landed at the airport on march 7, 2024, wearing his rolex watch.

Shannon Sharpe’s sexually explicit texts with the young OnlyFans model show a very different side of the NFL legend



Shannon Sharpe reached a settlement with the OnlyFans model despite denying such accusations



Shannon Sharpe, the NFL legend, had a lot going on in his career as a host when things came crashing down in April 2025 after he was accused of sexual assault by a young OnlyFans model. Shannon Sharpe, the multi millionaire, was sued for a whopping $50 million by the woman as his fans got to see the sexually explicit conversations he has had with the woman.As Shannon Sharpe found himself involved in a scandalous legal mess, his legal team released texts exchanged between him and the young OnlyFans model to prove that the two were in a “consensual” relationship.In one of the texts released by Shannon Sharpe’s legal team, the young OnlyFans model texted him, “mhmmm u still have my handcuffs. I want like some hardcore bdsm action tho. feeling kinda freaky lately.”Another text from 11th August 2024 showed that the OnlyFans model texted Shannon Sharpe, “i’ll let you make it hang wherever u want daddy but ONLY if you take me out and treat me good…”This prompted Shannon Sharpe to respond with, “Deal. I crave ur p—y [Doe]. That’s my p—y now.”A third text from 23rd November 2023 showed that the young woman wrote, “only if you put that baby gravy in me, then u can do whatever u want to me.… i literally ate so much food i look like I’m pregnant with ur big black baby.”The young OnlyFans model’s legal team has alleged that while the two were in a “rocky consensual relationship”, Shannon Sharpe reportedly ended up sexually assaulting her a few times.Back in April 2025, Shannon Sharpe’s legal team issued a statement that read as, ""Mr. Sharpe categorically denies all allegations of coercion or misconduct — especially the gross lie of 'rape' — and will not submit to what he sees as an egregious attempt at blackmail…”The statement added, “He stands firmly by the truth and is prepared to fight these false claims vigorously in court…”Months later, in July 2025, Shannon Sharpe ended up settling the legal matter as he paid $20 million to the young woman.Also Read: Shannon Sharpe’s alleged demand before meeting OnlyFans model raises eyebrows amid his $20M settlement with her",Shannon sharpe was accused of sexual assault by a young onlyfans model.

Real-world lessons over instant gratification







Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has an important and surprising piece of advice for young people who are dreaming of entrepreneurial success. Bezos said ‘Go work at McDonald’s.’ As reported by Fortune, in a recent interview, Bezos stressed on the importance of early work experience especially in the fast-paced, customer-facing environment. “I always advise young people: Go work at McDonald’s,” Bezos said. “You learn responsibility. You learn how to show up. You learn how to deal with people. You learn how to hustle.”For those unaware, Bezos started Amazon out of his garage in 1994. He believes that entry-level jobs such as those at McDonald’s tech foundational skills which are important for long term success. He emphasised that such small roles are necessary as they instill skill like discipline, resilience and the ability to handle pressure. These are the traits that many Gen Z entrepreneurs may overlook in their rush to build startups.The comments by Bezos come at a time when debate is growing over the value of traditional work experience versus the allure of instant digital success. With platforms like TikTok and YouTube offering rapid fame and monetization, Bezos’ advice serves as a reminder that grit and consistency still matter.Jeff Bezos also stressed that the working environments like McDonald’s exposes Gratification. He noted that the working environment such as McDonald’s expose young people to real world challenges such as managing time, dealing with customers and working as part of a team. Bezos argue that these experiences are more valuable than any theoretical knowledge or online hustle. “You don’t need to start a company at 20,” he added. “You need to learn how the world works first.”",Amazon founder jeff bezos has an important and surprising piece of advice for young people who are dreaming of entrepreneurial success.

Poll Is it reasonable for companies to comply with the laws of the countries they operate in, even on privacy issues? Yes, it's necessary No, companies should have their own standards

What Zoho’s Sridhar Vembu wrote in X post

On the topic of privacy, there are three distinct cases I want to address:

1. The secret lover case

2. The violation we feel when a company uses our personal data to show ads to us

3. The secret rebel case

The secret lover case also applies to org trade secrets and confidential data but ""secret lover"" is more catchy 😁

We work hard to ensure your privacy in case 1. Our tech stack and product are designed with this as a major goal.

Let me come to case 2. By taking a vow to not use your data to try to sell you stuff, we protect you from that sense of distaste or violation. Our strong stand also ensures that corporate confidential data or trade secrets do not get leaked to those ad-related data mining systems.

The secret rebel case is subject to the laws of the nations we operate in. Any company operating in a jurisdiction promising to protect a secret rebel against their own government is making a false promise. Sovereign power always prevails over mere companies. Whether it is Google or Apple, when they operate in India, they have to comply with Indian law and likewise Zoho has to comply with US law when operating in America.

So while secret rebels can communicate like secret lovers do, secret rebels cannot expect courts to affirm their right to plot against their government.

Our stand has been consistent on this matter. I have said these in our Zoholics events in many locations around the world for well over a decade.





Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu outlined his company’s approach to users’ privacy and the limits of corporate responsibility on X (formerly Twitter) recently. In the post, he described three privacy cases – secret lover, use of personal data to show ads and secret rebel. He also emphasized that all companies must follow the laws of the country in which they operate. “Whether it is Google or Apple, when they operate in India, they have to comply with Indian law and likewise Zoho has to comply with US law when operating in America,” Vembu writes in the post. His remarks comes as the company's messaging platform Arattai gains popularity, topping both Apple App Store and Google Play Store.The first, which he called the “secret lover case,” refers to personal data, corporate trade secrets, and confidential information. He said Zoho designs its technology and products to protect such data and maintain strict privacy.The second, he said, involves the use of personal data for targeted advertising. Zoho has pledged not to use customer data to sell products or services, a practice Vembu said prevents a sense of violation and protects corporate confidential information from ad-related data-mining systems.The third, the “secret rebel case,” refers to situations where individuals may seek to challenge their governments.","Zoho founder sridhar vembu outlined his company’s approach to users’ privacy and the limits of corporate responsibility on x.

In the rapidly evolving world of AI-powered content, Elon Musk has taken a bold step forward. On October 5, 2025, he unveiled Grok Imagine Version 0.9, a major update to his AI platform designed to generate text, images, and videos with unprecedented speed, accuracy, and realism across multiple creative formats. This launch comes just days after OpenAI’s Sora 2 release on September 30, intensifying the competition in AI video generation, creative technology, and immersive digital experiences.Musk’s announcement underscores his ambition to transform both the entertainment and gaming industries through generative AI, while also sparking debate about the potential limitations, societal impact, and ethical considerations of AI-generated content.Grok Imagine 0.9 introduces several cutting-edge improvements that make AI content generation faster and more versatile than ever. Musk detailed these features on X (formerly Twitter):These upgrades highlight Musk’s goal of creating a multi-functional AI platform capable of producing movies, short videos, and interactive media at scale.Musk’s vision extends beyond video and image creation. In a recent X post, he revealed that his xAI game studio plans to release a “great” AI-generated video game before the end of 2026.A shared clip demonstrated a rudimentary first-person shooter, reminiscent of popular titles like Call of Duty, showcasing the potential of AI in gaming.To further this initiative, xAI is actively hiring a Video Games Tutor, offering $45–$100 per hour to train Grok to produce “engaging, fun, and innovative video games.” The role emphasises AI-assisted game design, including accurate annotations, iterative testing, and fostering interactive entertainment. This development aligns with industry trends. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney predicts that AI prompts will allow small development teams to create games on the scale of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, unlocking entirely new genres and gameplay experiences previously impossible without AI.Despite the excitement, many industry experts remain cautious about AI’s creative capabilities. Michael “Cromwelp” Douse, publishing director at Larian Studios, emphasized that AI cannot replace human leadership, vision, or storytelling. According to Douse, AI-generated content may lack the emotional resonance and artistry required to truly engage audiences.Critics also point to the challenge of maintaining cultural and creative authenticity in both video games and movies. While AI can produce technically perfect results, the human touch—the skill, imagination, and cultural insight—remains central to crafting meaningful experiences.Musk’s ambitions are equally significant in the film industry. He recently predicted that Grok will produce a movie that is “at least watchable before the end of next year” and will deliver high-quality films by 2027. A six-second video clip of generic Hollywood-style action accompanied the tweet, illustrating the AI’s growing cinematic capabilities.However, generative AI in movies has sparked controversy. The emergence of AI-generated actors, such as Tilly Norwood, has elicited backlash from Hollywood. Furthermore, concerns about copyright infringement persist, as AI platforms—including Grok—have faced legal challenges for generating content using copyrighted characters. For instance, Grok-generated images of Nintendo’s mascot were removed from Twitter due to takedown notices. Disney and Universal have also taken legal action against AI companies for unauthorized use of their characters. Grok Imagine 0.9 represents a pivotal moment in AI content generation, bridging the worlds of video, film, and gaming. Musk’s predictions indicate a future where AI can create movies, games, and interactive experiences with unprecedented speed, while also raising questions about ethics, creativity, and copyright.Industry experts argue that while AI is a powerful tool, human creativity and oversight remain essential. The future of AI-driven filmmaking and gaming will likely involve a hybrid approach, combining AI’s technical efficiency with the artistry and vision of human creators.","Elon musk’s grok imagine 0.9 boosts ai video, text, and image creation.

Poll Do you support companies sponsoring H-1B visas despite the new fee? Yes, it's essential for talent acquisition. No, the fee is too high.

Read Jensen Huang’s memo to staff on H-1B visa

Hi everyone,

Immigration is at the heart of the American dream — an enduring symbol of opportunity that reminds us that anyone, regardless of where they come from, can achieve success and build a better life through hard work, talent, and determination.

As one of many immigrants at NVIDIA, I know that the opportunities we've found in America have profoundly shaped our lives. And the miracle of NVIDIA — built by all of you, and by brilliant colleagues around the world — would not be possible without immigration.

H-1 B visas provide a vital pathway for exceptional talent to contribute to America's growth and innovation. Legal immigration remains essential to ensuring the U.S.

continues to lead in technology and ideas.

The administration's recent changes reaffirm this — helping America attract and retain the most exceptional talent. At NVIDIA, we built our company with extraordinary people from around the world, and we will continue to sponsor H-1B applicants and cover all associated fees.

If you have any questions about H-1B visas, please reach out to NVIDIA-Immigration.

Best regards,

Jensen





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has sent an internal memo to the company’s staff stating that the chip maker will continue to sponsor H-1B visas and cover all associated costs. The development comes following President Donald Trump ’s executive order imposing $100,000 annual fees on H-1B visas. In the memo, Huang writes that “” and “as one of many immigrants” himself, “H-1 B visas provide a vital pathway for exceptional talent to contribute to America's growth and innovation.”,” the Taiwan-born executive continues, adding “At Nvidia, we built our company with extraordinary people from around the world, and we will continue to sponsor H-1B applicants and cover all associated fees.”Speaking on the ""BG2 Pod"" podcast published last month, Jensen Huang described the policy changes as ""a great start"" that addresses illegal immigration and visa system abuse. However, he cautioned that the steep fee ""probably sets the bar a little too high"" and could make foreign students uncomfortable about pursuing opportunities in America.He emphasised that talent inflow serves as a key performance indicator for the country's future success.

“The sustainability of OpenAI’s infrastructure spending will increasingly depend on equity & debt financing. We believe it will increasingly need to rely on equity/debt raises — with up to ~$75bn in 2026 alone,”





Goldman Sachs have a warning against Nvidia's multibillion-dollar investments in companies like OpenAI and Intel. An analyst from the investment banking company has suggested that some of this revenue surge may not be entirely organic. Nvidia has committed major investments, including up to $100 billion for OpenAI and an additional $5 billion for Intel. These investments are contributing to a massive demand for Nvidia's chips. However, in a recent note Goldman Sachs analyst James Schneider (seen by Benzinga) stated that Nvidia's equity financing to customers is starting to resemble “circular revenue.” The analyst believes that investments flow out as funding, and the returns are realized via GPU sales, effectively inflating reported growth.Referring to Nvidia’s deal with OpenAI, the report explained the trend, where the US chip maker expects to earn about $13 billion in revenue from the AI startup in 2026, and around $10 billion of that profit will be put back into the business.reinvested back into the company. It’s like a food supplier giving money to the same restaurants that buy its ingredients.Schneider said, especially when the same money is circulated back through business deals between the companies.Goldman Sachs sees Nvidia’s investments as more than just financial decisions. The company sees these investments as strategic actions that tie developers more closely to Nvidia's CUDA software, increase sales of its hardware, and influence how the AI market develops.Schneider added.The company also expects Nvidia's datacenter revenue to come from a wider range of customers beyond Big Tech companies like Google-parent Alphabet, Meta and Amazon. More income will come from AI startups and government buyers, groups that are less stable and rely heavily on outside funding, the analysis claimed. While traditional Big Tech companies remain Nvidia's most reliable customers, government-backed national AI programs are increasingly driving demand from countries.Meanwhile, Goldman estimates OpenAI will need $35 billion in 2026 just for the computer hardware needed to run and train its AI systems. This funding is expected to come from three places: $17 billion from OpenAI's own earnings, $10 billion from Nvidia investments, and about $9 billion from other investors or loans.However, the financial pressure increases significantly when considering longer-term obligations, including $60 billion for Nvidia-backed data centers and $19 billion for Stargate infrastructure. In total, OpenAI could need $114 billion in cash for 2026 alone.This means a funding shortage of $62 billion, even after using $17 billion in available cash which is raising serious questions about whether Nvidia's customers can sustain their current spending levels.Morever, startups like OpenAI have smaller profit margins. The analysis predicted that they're much more affected by changes in investment markets which will make it harder for them to keep spending consistently.Schneider explained.","Goldman sachs have a warning against nvidia's multibillion-dollar investments in companies like openai and intel.

Eiffel Tower’s controversial beginnings

Engineering marvel vs. artistic criticism

Poll What is the greater contribution of the Eiffel Tower? Engineering and scientific innovation Cultural and aesthetic icon

Science secures survival





When the Eiffel Tower was first erected for the 1889 World’s Fair in Paris, it faced harsh criticism. Prominent artists and writers labeled it “monstrous” and “useless,” and its creator, Gustave Eiffel, initially received only a 20-year permit to occupy the land. Despite its groundbreaking engineering, many Parisians disliked the structure, fearing it would scar the city’s beauty. Yet Eiffel found a clever way to secure its survival: he transformed the tower into a hub for scientific research and communication. By installing a station at its peak for experiments and radio transmissions, he proved its practical value and ensured it would remain standing long after the World’s Fair ended.The idea for the Eiffel Tower originated in 1884 when engineers Emile Nouguier and Maurice Koechlin, working for Eiffel, envisioned an iron lattice tower. They wanted to build a vertical spectacle that would demonstrate the possibilities of modern iron construction and celebrate France’s industrial and technological achievements. After securing a patent and winning a competition for the 1889 World’s Fair centerpiece, construction began in January 1887 and concluded in March 1889.Despite its rapid completion, the project faced public backlash. A letter signed by writers, artists, and architects—including Guy de Maupassant and Charles Garnier—called the tower a “tragic street lamp” and “Tower of Babel,” reflecting fears that it would ruin Paris’ aesthetic charm.The tower’s design sparked debate over whether it represented true architecture or pure engineering. Critics objected to its exposed iron frame and massive base, while Eiffel argued that elegance could exist within engineering. Initially adorned with decorative Gothic elements, many were later removed, leaving the stark lattice structure. Over time, public opinion shifted as visitors marveled at unprecedented panoramic views of Paris from its heights, demonstrating the tower’s unique attraction.Eiffel ensured the tower’s long-term survival by dedicating its top to scientific experimentation. Atmospheric studies and other research took place at the summit, giving the tower functional value beyond mere aesthetics. In 1898, it became a radio transmission site, and by 1908, experiments transmitted signals over thousands of miles. These scientific uses proved crucial in gaining a 70-year extension on Eiffel’s permit, effectively saving the structure from demolition. Today, the Eiffel Tower is one of the most visited monuments in the world, attracting millions of tourists annually. Its transformation from a controversial eyesore to an iconic symbol of Paris underscores the power of innovation and vision.","The eiffel tower was erected for the 1889 world’s fair in paris.

Defence, investment, and the new space race





Europe’s space ambitions are at a critical juncture, according to Bernard Liautaud, managing partner at Balderton Capital. Speaking at the Italian Tech Week event, Liautaud warned that the continent risks falling behind in the rapidly expanding space and defence sectors due to an excessive dependence on American companies, particularly Elon Musk’s SpaceX . While European start-ups have made notable advances in satellite technology and defence innovation, SpaceX’s dominance in launch services and communications infrastructure poses a “huge risk” to Europe’s technological sovereignty and national security. Liautaud urged governments to accelerate investment in domestic capabilities and nurture home-grown innovation to strengthen Europe’s position in the global space race.Liautaud cautioned that European nations remain overly reliant on American firms for satellite launches and space-based infrastructure. SpaceX, now valued at around $400 billion (£315 billion), dominates both the commercial launch market and the communications satellite sector, a dependency he described as strategically dangerous. “We need to be more self-sufficient,” he said, underlining that control over space technology is becoming a decisive factor in military and economic strength. Despite US dominance, Europe’s start-up ecosystem is showing promising growth. Liautaud argued that supporting such enterprises is essential for Europe’s strategic autonomy, calling start-ups “a key ingredient” in the effort to achieve technological sovereignty.European investment in defence and aerospace technology has surged since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, driving the emergence of new firms specialising in drones, battlefield software, and orbital infrastructure. Liautaud stressed that space-based capabilities are now integral to both military supremacy and global competitiveness. By cultivating independent launch systems and communications networks, Europe can reduce its exposure to foreign political and commercial pressures.Industry leaders share Liautaud’s concern. Hélène Huby, founder of The Exploration Company and a former Airbus executive, described Europe as “quite weak right now regarding space-based infrastructure.” With US giants like SpaceX and Blue Origin racing ahead, the window for Europe to build independent capabilities is rapidly closing. “We must act now,” Liautaud urged, framing Europe’s challenge not merely as a question of innovation but of strategic survival in the new era of space competition.","Europe’s space ambitions are at a critical juncture, according to bernard liautaud, managing partner at balderton capital.

China's K visa faces online backlash: Locals vent on Weibo; here's why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinas-k-visa-faces-online-backlash-locals-vent-on-weibo-heres-why/articleshow/124309445.cms,"Representational photo

What is K Visa





China’s new K visa for foreign professionals is facing criticism on social media even before it comes into effect. Netizens have raised concerns over its timing, fairness, and potential impact on domestic employment.Originally scheduled to launch on October 1, the visa’s rollout has been delayed as Chinese embassies abroad remain closed until October 8 for National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival holidays.The K visa, described as China’s version of the H-1B, was announced in August but gained attention only after US president Donald Trump highlighted the USD 1,00,000 fee for H-1B visas, which mainly benefit Indian professionals.Critics pointed to China’s high unemployment, estimated at around 19 per cent over the past two years, and the pressure of 12 million new graduates entering the job market each year. Many questioned the policy favouring foreign STEM graduates over domestic talent.Concerns were also raised over the lack of employer sponsorship, which could increase the risk of fraud and low-quality applications.One Weibo user wrote: “It is already hard to verify domestic degrees. With the K visa, agencies may exploit the system to help foreigners get visas. How will each application be properly vetted?”Others asked why foreign bachelor’s degree holders are treated as ‘tech talent’ while young Chinese graduates struggle to find jobs and often pursue master’s degrees.Some suggested that a master’s degree should be the minimum requirement for K visa applicants.The newly introduced K visa, announced in August, aims to attract young international STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) graduates by offering entry, residency and work authorisation without requiring any prior work offer.According to Xinhua, the K visa will offer longer validity, multiple entries, and extended stay periods compared to China’s 12 existing visa types. Holders can engage in education, culture, science and technology exchanges, as well as entrepreneurial and business activities.","The k visa, described as china’s version of the h-1b, was announced in august.

Tata Capital IPO: Why has GMP crashed?

Tata Capital: Long-Term Outlook

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Tata Capital IPO: The initial public offering of Tata Group ’s flagship financial services arm Tata Capital got a big thumbsup from brkokerages, with several positive reviews. Yet, the Grey Market Premium (GMP) has crashed to just 3%. The GMP is usually seen as an indicator of the expected listing gains.Tata Capital stands amongst India's prominent non-banking finance companies (NBFCs). The IPO offers shares at Rs 310 to Rs 326, comprising a fresh issue of Rs 6,846 crore alongside an offer for sale (OFS) of Rs 8,666 crore by Tata Sons, the promoter. The subscription period concludes on October 8, with the anticipated listing on October 13.The company's robust fundamentals, varied business portfolio, and reliable parent organisation have garnered widespread appreciation from analysts, according to an ET report.Brokerages including Canara Bank Securities, Anand Rathi, BP Wealth, and Mehta Equities have endorsed it as a worthwhile long-term investment. They highlight Tata Capital's established retail and SME operations, sound asset management, and digital lending initiatives as advantageous factors in India's expanding credit sector.The conservative GMP indicates investor wariness regarding immediate returns.Market specialists point out three fundamental factors contributing to this restrained sentiment, the ET report said.Initially, the offering's valuation structure provides minimal scope for immediate appreciation. With a post-issue book value multiple of 4.2 to 4.3 times at the higher price range, Tata Capital's valuation aligns with industry counterparts such as Bajaj Finance and HDB Financial. Industry watchers note that positive aspects, including robust financial health and consistent earnings, are already reflected in the pricing.Arihant Capital Markets' Chief Strategy Officer, Shruti Jain, attributes the modest grey market premium to appropriate pricing.""At 4.2–4.3x post-money, the IPO valuations don't leave much on the table for listing gains. While the fundamentals are strong, the current market is cautious, with several growth companies facing valuation pressures. That's why the GMP hasn't picked up despite Tata Capital's sound business model,"" she explained.Additionally, the recent consolidation with Tata Motor Finance Ltd. (TMFL) has generated uncertainties regarding portfolio quality and earnings potential.Abhinav Tiwari, Research Analyst at Bonanza, pointed out that despite the merger enhancing Tata Capital's vehicle finance operations, it has temporarily elevated its gross non-performing assets (NPA) to approximately 1% from 0.5%.""The merger led to a short-term rise in NPAs and reduced the return on equity (ROE) to 12.6% in FY25 from 14.2% in FY24,"" he said.The IPO landscape has become considerably congested. The simultaneous occurrence of major issues alongside competition from LG Electronics has stretched investor funds. This situation has constrained speculative activities in the grey market, which operates based on short-term trading sentiment.According to Prashanth Tapse, Senior Vice President at Mehta Equities, investors must now be more discriminating. ""In the current IPO frenzy, where investor capital is limited, careful selection becomes crucial to maximize return. While Tata Capital's IPO has attracted attention, other high-growth offerings like LG Electronics may be drawing part of the focus,"" he said.Analysts widely agree that Tata Capital offers steady growth potential over the long run. The company plans to utilise fresh capital from its public offering to strengthen its Tier-I position, enabling expansion of its lending operations. The organisation's balanced lending portfolio, spread across consumer, small business and corporate sectors, stands to gain from India's robust credit requirements in the coming years.Whilst current unofficial market sentiment appears subdued, Tata Capital's core business metrics and established brand value position it as a stable investment avenue for extended periods rather than immediate listing gains, the ET report said.","Tata capital stands amongst india's prominent non-banking finance companies (nbfcs) the ipo offers shares at rs 310 to rs 326, comprising a fresh issue of rs 6,846 crore alongside an offer for sale (ofs) of rs 8,666 crore. The subscription period concludes on october 8, with the anticipated listing on october 13.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124355906,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-104856,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

SBI looking to ease KYC burden: Chairman C S Setty,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sbi-looking-to-ease-kyc-burden-chairman-c-s-setty/articleshow/124397324.cms,"File photo: Chairman C S Setty





MUMBAI: The country's largest lender SBI is engaging with regulators to simplify its 'know your customer' (KYC) process, chairman C S Setty said, underlining the bank's efforts to improve access and quality of financial services.""Simplifying KYC and re-KYC processes is critical for both customers and banks. We are taking initiatives from SBI's side to engage with regulators and simplify the process,"" he said.Despite its intent to update customer data and curb fraud, varying practices have made re-KYC a compliance hassle for many Indians. Some customers have complained that they are called for re-KYC once in two years and faced the risk of being barred from transacting on their bank accounts if they did not comply.Customers have complained that in the case of public sector banks the requirements for re-KYC are more frequent than in the case of private banks. PSU bankers said that the frequency is also a function of the account being inactive or the account getting flagged because of irregular transactions. Banks have also been under pressure from authorities because of some basic bank accounts being used as mule accounts in the case of online frauds.Earlier, in an interview to TOI, RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra had said that customer convenience remains a key priority and simplifying KYC is central to that effort. He said that the effort was to ensure that once KYC is completed with one regulated entity, it should apply across all others, and address updates should automatically reflect but no specific timeline has been set for full implementation.Speaking at the Global Fintech Fest here on Wednesday, Setty noted SBI's combination of digital and physical presence. ""We have about 1.6 lakh touch points today. It is not only digital channels; we are also reimagining physical outlets to ensure services are accessible across the country,"" he said. SBI's contact centres handle over 60% of traffic from rural and semi-urban areas, providing services in 15 languages, reflecting the bank's focus on inclusive banking.Setty stressed serving India's diverse customer base, from first-time account holders to high-net-worth individuals. ""Providing scale and access is a challenge given India's demographic and geographic diversity. Today, our 520 million customers are never denied service, whether it is basic banking or wealth management,"" he said.Technology has accelerated customer onboarding. ""Earlier, onboarding at a branch could take an hour. Today, using e-Aadhaar and the reimagined Yono portal, we complete it in 10-15 minutes,"" Setty said. SBI's Yono 2.0 app will expand to 15 languages and focus on products for farmers, MSMEs, and financial customers.On financial inclusion, Setty noted SBI's 2.5 million business correspondents provide 33 banking services across rural, semi-urban, and urban areas. He pointed to PMJDY (PM Jan Dhan Yojana ) accounts: 150 million gender accounts opened, 99.5% funded, with 56% operated by women.Setty also noted that one-third of SBI's customer base is under 35 and stressed life-cycle financial management, including education loans.","The country's largest lender sbi is engaging with regulators to simplify its 'know your customer' (kyc) process, chairman c s setty said.
