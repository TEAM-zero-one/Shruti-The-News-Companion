'Proud Moment For Humanity!' Social Media Roasts Galgotias University, China Reacts To Robo Dog Row

Damage control and shifting explanations

When a four-legged robot named “Orion” trotted onto the floor of the India AI Impact Summit, it was meant to showcase cutting-edge innovation from Greater Noida. Instead, within hours, it triggered a storm that forced Galgotias University to vacate its stall and issue a public apology — after social media users identified the machine as a Chinese-made product.The row began when Professor Neha Singh, representing the university at the summit, introduced a robotic dog branded as “Orion” during a media interaction. In a clip aired by DD News, she said the robot “has been developed by the Centre of Excellence at Galgotias University” and described its surveillance and monitoring capabilities.However, online users quickly pointed out that the robot appeared identical to the Unitree Go2, a commercially available quadruped manufactured by Unitree Robotics. The model is widely used in research and education globally and is available in India for roughly Rs 2–3 lakh.What followed was swift ridicule and political criticism. Critics alleged that an imported Chinese product had been presented as an in-house innovation at a summit designed to spotlight domestic AI capability.As scrutiny intensified, sources said that authorities asked the university to vacate its stall.Power supply to the pavilion was reportedly cut before the team cleared the premises.The Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology made its position clear. Secretary S Krishnan said the government wanted “genuine and actual work” to be reflected at expos and that “misinformation cannot be encouraged”. Without directly assigning blame, he added that organisers did not want controversy surrounding exhibits and that a code of conduct was essential.Additional Secretary Abhishek Singh said the intention was not to stifle innovation but that displays should not be misleading, and the episode should not overshadow the efforts of other participants.Faced with mounting backlash, the university’s response evolved over the course of the day.In an initial statement, it maintained that it had not claimed to have built the robot, arguing that exposure to global technologies was central to student learning. It described criticism as a “propaganda campaign” and said robotic programming formed part of its effort to help students develop real-world AI skills using globally available tools.Registrar Nitin Kumar Gaur later sought to clarify what he called a “jumble” between the words “develop” and “development”. Speaking to ANI, he said the university did not develop the robot but had “worked on its development” for academic and research purposes. The machine, he said, had been purchased to support student research.Professor Singh also issued a clarification, saying there had been a “misinterpretation” and that the university never claimed the robot was manufactured by it. She accepted that she may not have conveyed her point clearly in the flow of the interaction.By evening, the tone shifted decisively. In a formal apology, the university said the representative manning the pavilion had been “ill-informed” about the technical origins of the product and had given “factually incorrect information” in her enthusiasm on camera, despite not being authorised to speak to the press.The statement insisted there was “no institutional intent to misrepresent this innovation” and said the university had vacated the premises in line with the organiser’s sentiment.Meanwhile, opposition leaders seized on the episode. Leader of opposition Rahul Gandhi described the summit as a “disorganised PR spectacle”, questioning why Chinese products were being showcased at an event meant to project India’s AI ambitions.","Galgotias university in greater noida was forced to vacate its stall and issue a public apology.

'Global South To Decide Next World Order': Stubb And Rubio Signal Shift, Echoe India's World View

New Delhi: India has emerged as a ""shining beacon"" among Global South nations on AI, but the real challenge now is moving beyond pilots to large-scale, trusted deployment, according to the 'Playbook for National AI Strategy and Implementation' released by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).Based on work across India, Egypt, Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines, the report argues there is no single lever to accelerate AI adoption. Countries instead need a tightly coordinated ecosystem spanning computing, funding, skills, governance and institutional accountability.Saibal Chakraborty, who leads BCG India's tech and digital advantage practice, said India already has a structural edge. ""India has solved a large part of the hard infrastructure and digital public infrastructure problem. Aadhaar, UPI and data centres make it much easier to build AI applications at scale,"" he said. The playbook cites the IndiaAI Mission's facilitation of over 38,000 GPUs, made available at under Rs 60 per hour after centralised govt negotiations with vendors.However, the report flags a financing gap. While India has more than 120 unicorns, private capital largely avoids ""socially sensitive sectors like climate, education and rural solutions"". To address this, the playbook backs govt-led fund-of-funds models for public interest AI use cases.On skills, Chakraborty said scaling artificial intelligence requires senior leadership trust and oversight. Without CEO-level confidence, AI risks remaining stuck in ""cool pilots"" despite strong national ambition","India has emerged as a ""shining beacon"" among global south nations on ai.

'AI Will Create More Than It Destroys': Microsoft India Chief Puneet Chandok Predicts 3-Year Rise

New Delhi: The increasing use of AI language models for information seeking and agentic commerce has put the existing internet business model under pressure, as these companies are crushing publishers, content creators, and small businesses, according to Matthew Prince, chief executive of internet infrastructure company Cloudflare.Explaining the problem, he said that for the past decade, individuals and creators - including researchers and small businesses - have sold subscriptions or shown ads to compensate for their work. But, now AI models scrape and regurgitate information, removing direct interaction between creators and users. ""Google was a great patron, but now things have changed.""For the last 10 years, for every two pages that Google scraped on the internet, they sent back one human visitor. Today, for every 30 pages, they send just one. It has become 15 times harder to get traffic from a Google search. Microsoft performs more poorly - it sends 70 to one. If we look at the pure AI companies, OpenAI takes 37,000 pages from the internet for every one visitor it sends back. In Anthropic's case, it's half a million pages,"" he said.Cloudflare handles almost 20% of internet traffic and works with all foundational model providers. ""The human eyeball traffic, which is the current currency of the internet, is going away. It is never going to return in the same way. We are getting more of our answers from AI than from original sources. And so we have to figure out a new way to compensate creators,"" he said. Prince said the world needs to figure out a new business model for the internet and develop a new rewards system beyond traffic.","Cloudflare ceo matthew prince says ai models are crushing publishers, content creators, and small businesses.

'India Well Positioned To Lead The World In AI': OpenAI CEO Sam Altman At AI Impact Summit

New Delhi: For years, Europe watched its best AI researchers migrate to the US. India has faced the same challenge - a steady bleeding of top engineering and computer science talent to Silicon Valley. Reversing this flow is central to the global AI race, says Arthur Mensch, co-founder and CEO of French startup Mistral AI. ""Like Europe, India was bleeding talent to the US,"" Mensch said in an interview with TOI. ""The more talent you retain and create value locally, the better.""Founded in 2023 by Mensch, Guillaume Lample and Timothee Lacroix, Mistral AI was created to challenge the opaque, closed nature of ""big AI"" and make frontier models more accessible through open architectures. In just three years, the company has scaled rapidly - reaching a $400 million revenue run rate and targeting over $1 billion in revenue soon. As of last year, it was valued at $14 billion.But for Mensch, the AI race is not just commercial. It is structural - and geopolitical. With Europe heavily reliant on overseas digital infrastructure, particularly US hyperscalers, Mistral has chosen to build its own capabilities.""We don't position ourselves as a sovereign alternative. We position ourselves as a global competitor in the AI race,"" he said. ""But tactically, to have capacity you fully control, you need infrastructure - the servers that run the technology. ""About 60% of Mistral's business comes from Europe and 40% from the rest of the world. Some customers opt for its platform precisely because it can be deployed on their own infrastructure, reducing dependence on hyperscalers.Sovereign AI, he believes, is both a strategic and political necessity. As AI begins to run large parts of the global economy, govts and defence systems cannot risk external control. For businesses, over-dependence weakens negotiating leverage and continuity.India, with one of the world's largest developer pools, has a similar inflection point. ""We've brought many European researchers back to Europe. India has a unique opportunity to do the same. Universities here produce excellent AI and computer science talent. The focus should be on ensuring they innovate and build value here,"" Mensch said. Mistral is currently building commercial partnerships in India, with a local technology centre a possible next step.While rivals such as OpenAI and Anthropic explore IPO paths, Mensch said a listing is ""down the road."" Profitability and global scale would be prerequisites.Mensch argues that much of enterprise AI adoption has stumbled because companies treated GenAI as a collection of tools rather than a platform shift. Early chatbot deployments focused on small productivity gains. ""That doesn't change the bottomline,"" he said. Instead, Mistral focuses on high-ROI use cases that address major sources of business friction.At the core of its strategy is open source. ""If you have access to model parameters, you can deploy wherever you want - including local infrastructure,"" Mensch said. Open models also allow customisation. ""Running a business should not mean over-dependence on a single service provider. I've said it multiple times - Europe cannot become an AI colony of the US.""","Mistral ceo arthur mensch: 'india well positioned to lead the world in ai' mistral ai was created to challenge the opaque, closed nature of ""big ai"" and make frontier models more accessible through open architectures.

The NBA's financial landscape is reaching new heights to fulfill its global expansion dream, fueled by the 11-year, $77 billion media rights deal with Disney, Amazon, and Comcast's NBCUniversal. And in this ever-evolving landscape of the salary caps, finding a superstar on a bargain deal is the ultimate cheat code for front offices.Though the trade season ended on February 5th, still lets take a look at some of the most valued NBA contracts in 2026 as per Spotrac. Spotrac broke down the most team-friendly deals in the league, excluding rookie scales and max extensions, to find the true steals.Fresh off his first All-Star appearance, Deni Avdija was Wizards’ 9th overall pick in 2020, and was later sent to Blazers in 2024, where he signed a 4-year, $55 million contract. It’s rare to find a potential All-Star locked into a declining salary structure, and the Blazers have exactly that.Avdija has $39.4 million remaining on his contract, and this season, he’ll earn $13.3 million, $13.1 million next season, and $11.8 million in 2027-28. Despite the declining salary value, he still has a $14.3 million cap hit and continues to blossom into a versatile wing who impacts both ends of the floor.Jalen Brunson’s four-year, $156.5 million extension stunned the basketball world as the 3-time NBA All-Star sacrificed a whopping $113 million to help the Knicks build a contender team. For the Knicks' offensive cornerstone, the $39.1 million average annual salary seems like a massive win for New York.Under this deal, Jalen Brunson will get a player option in the final season and is eligible to sign an extension worth over $400 million. He is set to earn $34.9 million this season, and this financial flexibility has allowed the Knicks to surround him with high-level talent.Derrick White is the ultimate connector, and his four-year, $125.8 million extension is proving to be worth every penny. With an average annual value of $31.5 million, the Celtics are paying a starter's salary for a player who has proven he can scale his role up to a primary option when needed.For the 2025-26 season, White is set to earn a base salary of $26,350,000, while carrying a cap hit of $28,100,000 and a dead cap value of $26,350,000. The contract will see him through the 2028-29 season, where he’ll earn $34.8 million with a player option.The post-Trae Young Hawks will be heavily dependent on the shoulders of the 24-year old Jalen Johnson. Since joining the franchise as a rookie, Johnson secured a 5 year, $150 million rookie extension back in 2024. Effective from this season, he’s set to earn a base salary of $30 million per season, which is Hawks’ masterstroke in cap management.Unlike most deals that scale upward, the flat structure means Johnson’s cap hit will actually become valuable with the rising salary cap each year. For the 23.3 points, 10.6 rebounds, and 8.2 assists threat, the $30 million paycheck is definitely a steal.Jaden McDaniels remains the Timberwolves’ elite perimeter defender while he continues to hone his skills as a two-way force on the hardwood. Signed under a five-year, $131 million rookie extension, the 25-year-old will get an annual average salary of $26.2 million.McDaniels is having a breakout season as he is shooting with a career high of 51.9% from the floor and 45.4% from the deep. His shot efficiency, combined with elite lockdown defense for under $27 million, is a steal for the Wolves and their luxury tax limit.","The nba's financial landscape is reaching new heights to fulfill its global expansion dream, fueled by the 11-year, $77 billion media rights deal with disney, amazon, and comcast's nbcuniversal.

Freddy Peralta’s 2026 MLB salary and contract structure

Breaking down Freddy Peralta’s net worth and overall earnings in 2026

A busy Major League Baseball winter has quickly turned the financials of Freddy Peralta from one of the Brewers' best bargains to talking points about the Mets' payroll. That makes the right-hander, who is only controlled through the end of the 2026 season with the extension he signed earlier in his career, likely not just a perfect fit for a contender in the short-term but probably a big-name free agent even sooner than later.That was before the January 2026 trade that sent Freddy Peralta to New York and essentially changed his financial trajectory. Part of a win-now deal for the Mets, the soon-to-be-31-year-old Peralta immediately became a big name that will be on the radar of anyone looking ahead to the next free agent class. Although it did not alter his existing contract, the trade bolstered his stock and bargaining position in advance of the last season of team control.Peralta is in the last of a five-year, $15.5 million team-friendly extension he signed in 2020 (the deal included club options). His salary comes in at just under $8 million for 2026, a figure well below the top end of starting pitcher pay, given the frontline-quality numbers he produces.That figure is probably more indicative of early-career security than of what the market actually has to offer today. Similar players with similar durability and strikeout rates command two- to three-times that amount per season.The appeal was apparent for the Mets, as they added a reliable arm without taking on any long-term financial obligation, and for Peralta, he gets to pitch in a big market in a walk year.Peralta’s career MLB earnings are set to be right around the low-to-mid $20 million range before taxes, agent fees, and living expenses by the end of the 2026 season. Net-worth estimates vary widely, but most put him in the mid-single-digit to low-eight-figure range in 2026, after accounting for savings, a modest endorsement income, and typical professional-athletes-go-broke planning.But what really determines Peralta's financial future is what happens next. There is a reasonable expectation among league execs that he will explore free agency post-2026, and early industry murmurs indicate a multi-year deal beyond the $100 million threshold if health and production stick around. That kind of contract would immediately eclipse his career earnings to this point and reset any conversation about his worth.","Peralta is in the last of a five-year, $15.5 million team-friendly extension he signed in 2020.

The couple is one of the most well-known and yet undisclosed partnerships in the game of hockey, and with their joint wealth, they have attracted attention in the face of the latest NHL news broadcasts.The personal net worth of Sidney Crosby is estimated to be about 75 million in 2026. The Penguin captain was the first player drafted in 2005 and has remained in the team since that time to become one of the highest-paid players in the league. The salary alone in the NHL has earned Crosby a reported total of over 155 million in almost twenty years.He signed a two-year, 17.4 million contract extension with the Pittsburgh Penguins in 2024, which guarantees his future in the franchise through the 2026-27 season.Crosby will be making a base salary with a big signing bonus to make him one of the highest veteran earners in the league in the 2025-26 NHL season. His regular output is still being used in NHL match preview shows and shows on the NHL match results.On top of the money Crosby makes on the ice, endorsements are a great way to increase his wealth. He also has long term relations with international brands such as Adidas, Gatorade, CCM and Tim Hortons. He has also ventured into investment in business, where he is an investor in Swiss watchmaker NORQAIN.

Senior staff are calling the tools ""broken slop generators""

CEO Julie Sweet had already warned: Adapt to AI or leave

Accenture has started tying promotion eligibility to AI tool usage, telling senior managers and associate directors that advancing to leadership roles will require demonstrating ""regular adoption"" of its artificial intelligence platforms. The move follows CEO Julie Sweet's earlier warning that employees unable to adapt to AI would be ""exited"" from the company — and it appears HR is now putting that stance into formal practice. The consulting giant has also begun tracking individual weekly logins to its AI tools for some senior staff, making it one of the more aggressive internal AI mandates seen at a major professional services firm.According to an internal email seen by the Financial Times, ""use of our key tools will be a visible input to talent discussions."" The policy is set to factor into the company's summer promotion decisions, with Accenture's AI Refinery among the tools being monitored.The reaction internally has been less than enthusiastic. Two people familiar with the changes told the FT they considered some of the tools to be ""broken slop generators,"" and one said they would ""quit immediately"" if the rule directly affected them. Staff in 12 European countries and those working on US federal government contracts are exempt from the new policy.The pushback isn't entirely surprising. Executives at three Big Four firms independently told the FT that getting senior managers and partners to adopt AI has proven far harder than with junior staff. Older, more senior professionals tend to be less comfortable with new technology and more attached to how they've always worked.Sweet has made the company's position clear. She previously told investors that Accenture would ""exit"" employees for whom reskilling on AI wasn't a viable path—and the latest promotion criteria appear to be the formal follow-through on that stance.The firm says it has trained 550,000 of its roughly 780,000 employees in generative AI and spends around $1 billion annually on learning and development. It also recently announced partnerships with OpenAI and Anthropic.Still, the urgency makes sense given the context. Accenture's share price has dropped roughly 42% over the past year, and the company is betting heavily that its AI-first repositioning—including rebranding its workforce as ""reinventors""—will reverse that slide.","Accenture is tying senior staff promotions to ai tool usage.

This change, highlighted by a product manager's new focus on AI-driven creation, aligns with CEO Mark Zuckerberg's vision of AI dramatically altering work. Companies like LinkedIn are also redefining roles, empowering individuals to code, design, and manage products with AI assistance.

Zuckerberg set the tone on the earnings call

LinkedIn, Google are making similar moves

Something is shifting at Meta, and it's not just the org chart. Some product managers at the company have started calling themselves ""AI builders""—a quiet but telling sign of how AI coding tools are beginning to blur the lines between who plans products and who actually builds them. It's a small label change, but it points to something bigger: the traditional PM role, long defined by roadmaps and stakeholder meetings, is quietly being rebuilt from scratch.Jeremie Guedj, a Meta product manager with over a decade of experience, announced the change on LinkedIn last week. ""I still can't believe I'm writing this: as of today, my full-time job at Meta is AI Builder,"" he wrote. His official title in Meta's internal systems hasn't changed, but his day-to-day work is now entirely focused on building with AI on what he calls an ""AI-native team."" At least three other Meta employees—a mix of product managers and engineers—also use the term in their LinkedIn bios, as first reported by Business Insider.The shift tracks with what Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during the company's Q4 2025 earnings call in January. ""We're elevating individual contributors and flattening teams,"" he said, adding that ""projects that used to require big teams"" are now being pulled off by a single person armed with the right AI tools.He called 2026 ""the year that AI starts to dramatically change the way that we work"" inside Meta.Guedj's new role looks a lot like what that vision looks like in practice—a team where ""humans and AI agents work together, synchronously and asynchronously,"" as he put it.Meta isn't alone here. LinkedIn recently scrapped its associate product manager program and replaced it with an ""associate product builder"" track, explicitly pushing new hires to code, design, and manage products all at once. At Google, at least one product manager told Business Insider that they've been encouraging designers and PMs on their team to ""blur roles a bit.""""AI builder"" isn't an official Meta designation—yet. But as Guedj put it: ""Building has always been my passion. AI gave me the ability to turn ideas into real, working apps. That changed everything.""","Product managers at meta are calling themselves ""ai builders"" it's a small label change, but it points to something bigger.

Cade Cunningham's shocked reaction after seeing multiple zeros in his bank account

Cade Cunningham's statistical impact and franchise expectations

One doesn’t always come across a mind blowing news while going out for a burger, but that’s what happened with Detroit Pistons’ superstar Cade Cunningham. Cunningham, in a talk with GQ, shared a candid moment that happened while he was waiting in a Sonic Drive-In line. It was a life-changing reality check when the 2021 #1 pick saw his bank account loaded with zeros, courtesy of his five-year rookie extension. He humorously noted that he could have ""bought the whole Sonic"" with that kind of money.The original contract increased from $224 million to $269 million after Cunningham triggered the NBA's Rose rule when he earned the All-Star honors in 2025. This contract is the largest deal in Pistons history and further cements Cunningham’s place as the franchise cornerstone.Cunningham recently appeared in his second consecutive All-Star game in LA and solidified himself as one of the greats in Piston’s franchise. What further encapsulates his importance for the team is his 5-year, $269 million maximum rookie extension he signed in 2024, which keeps him in Detroit through the 2029-30 season.In the latest interview with GQ, Cunningham revealed how the extension amount shocked him when he saw his bank account. He said, “I checked and that m* was loaded like crazy! I think we were going to Sonic or something. Could buy the whole Sonic, man!”The contract officially kicked in during the 2025-26 season, and is a reflection of the explosive growth of NBA salaries.Under the contract, Cade will earn an average annual salary of $53.8 million throughout the contract with 8% annual raises. For this season, he’s set to earn a base salary of $46.3 million, $50 million next season, followed by $53 million and $57 million. The biggest chunk comes in the final year when Cunningham will take home a whopping $61.2 million. These figures are nearly double of some veteran's total career earnings.The Pistons' decision to award Cunningham the max extension was driven by his 2023-24 campaign where he proved his elite productivity by averaging 22.7 points, 7.5 assists, and 4.3 rebounds per game while shooting 44.9% from the field. He followed with another outstanding year in 2025-25 where he dropped 26.1 PPG, 9.1 APG and 6.1 RPG.This season, the Pistons are leading the East with 41-13 and with their recent 126-111 win over the Knicks they have extended their winning streak to 4. Cunningham has remained a statistical outlier with his average 25.7points, 5.7 rebounds and 9.7 rebounds and efficient shooting of 46.3% from the floor. He also holds the franchise record for the most games with at least 25 points and 10 assists.By securing Cunningham through 2030, Detroit’s front office has tied up approximately 25% to 30% of their projected salary cap in a single player. The front office’s bet on this 6'6"" framed elite playmaker is wrapped with hope that he will eventually translate this trust into winning an NBA ring.","Cunningham recently appeared in his second consecutive all-star game in la.

Claims generate online interest and academic caution

Natural caves already exist beneath the Giza Plateau

Speculation links findings to ancient myths and older cultures

Cairo: PM Narendra Modi visits 'The Great Pyramid of Giza'





Reports emerging in March 2025 have drawn attention to fresh claims about hidden structures beneath the Pyramid of Khafre on the Giza plateau. An Italy-based research group, working with satellite radar imagery rather than ground excavation, says it has identified large underground features extending deep below the monument. The team used Synthetic Aperture Radar data gathered from orbiting satellites and processed it to produce composite images of subsurface density. Their interpretation points to vertical shafts and sizable chambers cut into the bedrock. The findings have not been verified through an on-site investigation. For now, they remain part of an ongoing debate about remote sensing methods, data interpretation and the long-studied geology of the Giza plateau in Egypt.The researchers relied on Synthetic Aperture Radar, often shortened to SAR. This technology sends radar signals from satellites in orbit. The signals reflect off the ground and are recorded, then processed using mathematical modelling. Variations in density and structure can appear as patterns in the final images.Based on this study, “What Really Lies Beneath the Pyramids?” , the team believes it can see eight deep cylindrical shafts beneath the pyramid.These are said to descend hundreds of metres into the limestone bedrock. At the lower end, the images appear to show two large cubic chambers. Inside the pyramid itself, five vertical voids are also suggested. It is an interpretation of patterns rather than a physical survey.The announcement moved quickly across social media platforms. Alternative history commentators gave it prominence. Videos and commentary circulated widely within days.Academic reaction has been more restrained. Egyptologists point out that satellite radar imagery can be complex. Image processing may produce shapes that resemble structures without confirming their material nature. Without drilling, excavation or ground-penetrating surveys, it is difficult to establish what lies below.The Giza plateau is not solid stone throughout. Limestone bedrock in the area contains natural cavities and fissures. Some caves have been explored in previous decades. Earlier geophysical surveys also detected voids in certain areas beneath the pyramids.Because of this, some researchers suggest the radar signatures could represent natural formations rather than engineered shafts. The difference matters. Geological voids are common in limestone terrain. The present claims do not yet clearly separate between natural and artificial origins.Beyond the technical dispute, some authors have made similarities between the suggested structures and the Duat, the nether region mentioned in funerary texts in ancient Egypt. Others go further and propose connections to Taş Tepeler-related prehistoric sites in Anatolia. These connections are yet theoretical. There is currently no archaeological evidence linking those previous cultures to the Giza plateau. For the time being, the radar investigation broadens the debate about Khafre's pyramid. It doesn't resolve the issue.",Satellite radar study claims vast underground structures beneath the giza pyramid. Researchers used synthetic aperture radar to map subsurface features.

Tarik Skubal net worth in 2026: Tracking the financial growth of one of baseball’s top left-handers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/tarik-skubal-net-worth-in-2026-tracking-the-financial-growth-of-one-of-baseballs-top-left-handers/articleshow/128612624.cms,"Tarik Skubal (Image Source: Getty)

Tarik Skubal’s arbitration win and its impact on net worth

What Skubal’s case means for pitchers and the market

As of February, Skubal's earnings hit headlines after a three-person arbitration panel ruled that he would receive a record $32 million salary for the 2026 season. The decision, which became the highest single-season arbitration award in Major League Baseball history, and the largest-ever amount awarded a pitcher through the process, dramatically altered the short-term financial perspective of perhaps the premier left-hander in the sport.Quite a journey for a pitcher whose career quickly advanced from an exciting piece in the rotation to shimmering in the Cy Young discussion and then topping it off with a contract that could have made him a franchise cornerstone. The Detroit ace initially settled for one year and $10.15 million to avoid arbitration for 2025, then decided to take his case to a hearing and prevailed. The end result was a 210% salary increase which fast-tracked his financial development and turned him into a free agent target on the horizon.According to publicly available salary data, by the time the 2026 season rolled around, Tarik Skubal had already made a lot of eight-figure range over the course of his career. His cumulative earnings through the 2025 season are estimated in the low-to-mid $20 million range by contract tracking services. This brings his gross career earnings over $50 million before his 30th birthday and now a $32 million arbitration award.But net worth does not equate to gross salary. Take-home is substantially diminished by federal and state taxes, agent commissions, which often are five to ten percent, and costs associated with a lifestyle. Based on those variables, the best guesstimate for Skubal's personal net worth at the point midway through the 2026 season is between $20 million and $35 million. The high end of that range presumes the most spendthrift lifestyle, no significant off-field business blow-ups and relatively low endorsement earnings, as a position-player superstar.The arbitration ruling has larger implications for teams and players alike beyond just Skubal himself. The award immediately adds pressure to the Detroit Tigers' payroll flexibility, but it also highlights how expensive it is to keep top-of-the-rotation arms that you cultivated yourself. Look for agents around the league to point to Skubal as a litmus test whenever the next arbitration-eligible ace comes up.And for Skubal himself, it could hardly have come at a better time. With free agency looming after the 2026 season, the left-hander now negotiates from a position of unprecedented power. Industry executives believe he could land a deal worth several hundred million dollars over the course of a decade if he continues to perform at an elite level. In that respect, those $32 million in arbitration dollars will one day be seen less as a high and more as a launching pad for Tarik Skubal's next phase of financial growth.",Detroit tigers left-hander tarik skubal was awarded a record $32 million salary for the 2026 season.

BENGALURU: A 25-year-old woman landed in deep trouble after taking an emergency loan from an online lending app. Fraudsters allegedly morphed her photos in obscene ways, shared them with her family and friends and threatened to make them viral on social media despite her clearing the loan amount. The accused extorted over Rs 1.1 lakh from her and are still demanding more.Ishita (name changed), a resident of New Thippasandra, told police she needed around Rs 10,000 for an emergency. Instead of asking someone, she decided to take a loan from an online app. She searched online, found a link for Loan Mitra app, downloaded it and entered her banking and personal details on Jan 27.The app approved only Rs 4,500 and disbursed Rs 2,700 to her bank account after deducting charges, including interest, and give her a deadline of seven days for repayment. She claimed she repaid Rs 4,500 before the due date. However, the app again disbursed the same amount to her account without her consent and began demanding repayment, Ishita told police.When she explained that she did not apply for the loan a second time and said she would repay the credited amount, the miscreants began threatening and harassing her through multiple phone calls, she said.They morphed her photos and threatened to share them with her contacts.Fearing the embarrassment, she started paying amounts demanded by the fraudsters. By Feb 12, she paid over Rs 1.1 lakh through digital payment apps to 16 UPI IDs provided by the accused.When Ishita ran out of money, she borrowed from family and friends to repay them. After she informed the fraudsters that she no longer had money, they continued calling and sending abusive messages. She switched off her phone in an attempt to avoid them.The fraudsters then created a WhatsApp group, adding her family members and friends from her contact list, and shared the morphed photos and videos. They also called her contacts and asked them to tell Ishita to repay the loan.A senior police officer said after the app was downloaded, it sought permission to access her contacts, photos and videos, which she had to approve to obtain the loan. The fraudsters then accessed her contact list and images and trapped her by offering quick loans without documentation.A case was registered against the fraudsters under Information Technology Act and BNS Section 318 (cheating).

Meet Asha Sharma: Indian-origin executive named CEO of Microsoft Gaming,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/meet-asha-sharma-indian-origin-executive-named-ceo-of-microsoft-gaming/articleshow/128628891.cms,"Asha Sharma’s journey to becoming Microsoft Gaming CEO

Changes across the gaming division

A pivotal moment





Microsoft has named Asha Sharma as the new chief executive of its gaming division, marking one of the most significant leadership changes in Xbox’s history. Sharma succeeds long-time gaming head Phil Spencer, who is retiring after nearly four decades at the company and will stay on as an adviser through the summer. Her appointment comes at a challenging moment for Microsoft Gaming, which is facing slowing revenue growth, rising costs and intense competition in the global console and content market.Sharma has been appointed Executive Vice President and CEO of Microsoft Gaming and will report directly to Satya Nadella, Microsoft’s chairman and chief executive. In her first comments following the announcement, Sharma said she would refocus on Xbox’s core audience while navigating a rapidly changing gaming landscape shaped by subscriptions, cloud gaming and large-scale acquisitions.Before taking charge of Microsoft Gaming, Sharma held senior leadership roles across some of the world’s biggest technology companies. At Microsoft, she most recently worked in AI platform and product leadership, giving her direct exposure to the company’s broader push into artificial intelligence. Before that, she served as chief operating officer at Instacart and held product leadership roles at Meta. Her career has largely focused on scaling platforms, managing large teams and steering products through periods of rapid growth.Sharma is US-educated, with a business degree from the University of Minnesota’s Carlson School of Management. While she is widely described as being of Indian origin, publicly available biographies and official company disclosures provide limited detail about her family background or roots, and she has not spoken extensively in public about her personal history. Her professional profile, however, places her firmly among a growing cohort of global tech leaders with diverse backgrounds.The leadership change comes as Microsoft Gaming faces multiple pressures. Gaming revenue has declined in recent quarters, hardware prices have risen due to cost pressures, and consumer spending remains uncertain. At the same time, Microsoft is still integrating Activision Blizzard, acquired in 2023 in a $69 billion deal that reshaped the company’s position in the gaming industry.Sharma’s background in operations, platforms and AI suggests Microsoft is betting on a leader who can balance content, technology and business discipline.Alongside Sharma’s appointment, Microsoft confirmed other senior changes. Matt Booty has been promoted to chief content officer, overseeing game studios and titles, while Sarah Bond is leaving the company to pursue a new chapter. Together, the moves point to a broader reset of the Xbox leadership structure.Sharma takes over at a time when Xbox is reassessing its identity. Competition from Sony’s PlayStation remains strong, especially in console market share and exclusive games. Analysts will be watching closely to see whether Sharma prioritises hardware, subscriptions, first-party content, or deeper integration with Microsoft’s AI and cloud businesses.Asha Sharma’s appointment marks the start of a new chapter for Microsoft Gaming. With Phil Spencer stepping back and a restructured leadership team in place, the company is signalling a willingness to rethink strategy at a time when the global games industry is under pressure. How Sharma navigates this transition will shape Xbox’s direction for years to come.","Asha sharma has been appointed executive vice president and ceo of microsoft gaming.

'Bulls***t': Macron Slams Social Media's 'Free Speech' Rhetoric, Calls For Algorithm Transparency





NEW DELHI: French President Emmanuel Macron sharply criticized social media companies and their technology executives, accusing them of falsely presenting themselves as champions of free speech.Speaking at the AI Summit being held in the national capital, Macron said, “Some of them claim to be in favor of free speech. We are in favor of free algorithms, totally transparent.”“Free speech is pure bullshit if nobody knows how you are guided through this,"" Politico quoted him saying.“All the algorithms have biases, we know that. There is no doubt. And they are so impactful, when you speak about social media, that having no clue about how the algorithm is made, how it is tested and where it will guide you — the democratic biases of this could be huge,” he added.Over the past decade, European Union lawmakers in Brussels have rolled out sweeping legislation aimed at curbing the power of major technology platforms. Landmark measures such as the General Data Protection Regulation, the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act were designed to strengthen privacy protections, rein in anti-competitive behavior and impose stricter obligations on content moderation. Washington, however, has framed elements of these laws as incompatible with US constitutional protections for speech.The dispute has since widened into a broader political clash, with American officials and several tech companies warning that Europe’s rules verge on censorship. European leaders counter that the regulations are necessary to tackle illegal content, disinformation and platform abuses.Among the most vocal has been Macron, who has repeatedly called for tighter limits on social media access for younger users — a stance that is gaining traction across parts of Europe as public concern over online harms intensifies.","French president emmanuel macron sharply criticized social media companies and their technology executives.

If you’ve taken the Dubai Metro or Tram lately, you’ve experienced Keolis's clockwork precision. Now, the global leader in shared mobility is entering a fresh chapter. The group has officially appointed Yoen Dupuis as the new CEO for its Middle East and East Asia regions.Based right here in the UAE, Dupuis is stepping into a high-stakes role that keeps millions of people moving every single day across some of the world’s most tech-forward cities.Keolis Group, a major global operator of public transportation networks, has appointed Yoen Dupuis as the Chief Executive Officer for the Middle East and East Asia region. This decisive leadership change is part of Keolis’ plan to expand its footprint and accelerate modern rail and automated metro services in key growth markets.In his new regional role, Dupuis will drive strategic planning, operations, and partnerships across countries including the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, and China, overseeing some of the world’s most advanced transit networks.Yoen Dupuis brings considerable experience to Keolis’ regional leadership position. Before this appointment, he spent more than a decade leading Keolis operations in the Greater Paris Region, turning it into a €1 billion enterprise with 8,500 staff and strengthening its service reputation.He also managed major transport platforms such as the Paris 2024 Olympic Games transit operations, showcasing his ability to handle complex, high-stake transit environments.Keolis’ International CEO Laurence Broseta applauded Dupuis’ record, noting his deep expertise in managing large networks and his capacity to build strong relationships with public authorities and partners across the world.Dupuis himself highlighted the region’s commitment to visionary infrastructure and innovation, and said that combining global expertise with local insight will be a top priority under his leadership.In his new role, Dupuis carries a heavy briefcase. He is now responsible for the Keolis MHI joint venture, the entity tasked by the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) to operate and maintain the Dubai Metro and Dubai Tram.His mission is clear: maintain the world-class safety standards Dubai is known for while integrating new smart technologies. Under his watch, the focus will likely remain on passenger happiness, punctuality, and the ""last-mile"" connectivity that helps residents get from the station to their front door.While Dubai is a major focus, Dupuis’s territory stretches far beyond the Arabian Gulf. His jurisdiction includes oversight of Keolis’s ventures in China (including the Shanghai Metro and the Greater Bay Area) and Australia (where the company manages massive tram and bus networks).By bridging the gap between Middle Eastern innovation and East Asian efficiency, Dupuis aims to create a ""knowledge corridor,"" bringing the best transport practices from Shanghai and Melbourne to the streets of Dubai and Doha.The appointment comes as the UAE doubles down on sustainability. Under Dupuis’s leadership, Keolis has signaled a significant push toward decarbonization.This involves exploring electric bus fleets, energy-efficient station cooling, and data-driven maintenance to prevent delays. For the average commuter, this leadership change might happen behind the scenes, but the result should be a smoother, greener, and more reliable journey every time you tap your Nol card.","Keolis appoints yoen dupuis as the new ceo for its middle east and east asia regions.

Travelers crossing the iconic 25-kilometer bridge between Saudi Arabia and Bahrain woke up to a new fee structure this week. For the first time in a decade, the King Fahd Causeway Authority (KFCA) has adjusted its toll rates to help fund ongoing infrastructure upgrades and enhance the digital travel experience.Whether you’re a weekend tourist or a daily commuter, the price to cross the Arabian Gulf's busiest artery has officially shifted gears.Here’s the new toll structure for one-way crossings:These updated fees replace the previous rates (which were 25 SAR for small cars after a 2016 increase).Despite these changes, the Authority has maintained its commitment to social support, confirming that students, people with disabilities, and regular daily commuters holding special transit cards are exempt from the hike and will continue to pay the legacy rates.To balance the new costs, a series of innovative ""Traveler Packages"" has launched exclusively through the Jesr (Causeway) app. These packages are a game-changer for those who cross the border often.The Frequent Traveler Package is the star of the show, offering a massive 40% discount for SAR 850, valid for 40 crossings within a month. For those who visit Bahrain less often, the Occasional Traveler option provides a 20% discount at SAR 1,120, valid for a full year.There is even a Round-Trip deal for SAR 60 that gives weekenders a 15% discount if they return within seven days.The move toward these new rates is part of a larger push to make the King Fahd Causeway one of the world's most technologically advanced borders. By encouraging drivers to use the Jesr app, the Authority aims to eliminate traditional toll-booth congestion.Users can now pay their fees, handle vehicle insurance, and even check a live stream of traffic before leaving home. This digital-first approach ensures that while the trip's cost has evolved, the time spent waiting at the gate is shorter than ever.","Car toll increased to 35 sar on king fahd causeway as updated pricing goes live.
