Why did PayPal pull out of Steam?

Collective pressure brings in change



How will PayPal unavailability impact players?



Steam Purchases BLOCKED By PayPal In Most Countries Over ""Content Concerns"" INSANE Suppression

Gamers worldwide have been hit with the unexpected hurdle as PayPal is no longer available as an option for Steam purchases in many countries. While the reason why PayPal pulled out has been linked by many to Steam’s current content policies, Valve's explanation seems to stretch far beyond just payment processing. Here is a complete breakdown of what we know about PayPal Steam withdrawal, which has left the gamers frustrated.Valve has confirmed that PayPal has stopped working in many countries. It came after one of PayPal's acquiring banks abruptly ended support for Steam transactions in certain currencies. The move impacts all the currencies apart from CAD, EUR, AUD, GBP, JPY and USD. As per Valve, this decision has been tied to the concerns over Steam adult content that remains available on platform.While Valve has explained the termination was quite sudden, it has been expressed that there’s still hope that PayPal will be restored in the future. However, no clear timeline is available for when this would happen or if it will happen. Valve further stated that the disruption on Steam has been tied to concerns about some content available on Steam. It’s a sentiment that echoed in the ongoing disputes with Mastercard over some adult-themed games.A spokesperson of Valve has confirmed the withdrawal to be specifically connected toThe implications of Valve PayPal issues are quite clear—the payment processors or partner banks are imposing restrictions, ensuring to respond to controversial games that are hosted on Steam.The current issue of PayPal has arrived just weeks after a number of adult-only games got removed by Steam, and new guidelines banning the content-violating rules have been set by card networks, payment processors or the banks. All these changes have come amidst the pressure from advocacy groups like Collective Shout. The group campaigns against the sexualized depictions of girls and women in the media.Although Mastercard has denied direct ordering of controversial games removal, Valve did maintain that intermediary banks and the processors play a role in shaping the policy changes. Withdrawal of PayPal for some currencies now seems to be yet another ripple effect of all the behind-the-scenes negotiations between financial partners and platforms.For gamers within the affected regions, PayPal isn’t an option for making purchases for now. Steam Wallet codes and the local systems are emerging as short-term Steam payment options for them for now. Despite Valve emphasizing that they hope for PayPal’s future restoration on Steam, timelines are uncertain because of the ongoing negotiations.While the restrictions are targeting legal yet controversial content on Steam, as per reports, it’s been argued by the IGDA that the resulting financial blockade is causing creative suppression. Both the gamers and the developers are calling for some clearer standards and better transparency from the payment companies and the platforms, something that can create a balance between creative freedom and regulatory compliance.",Valve has confirmed that paypal has stopped working in many countries.

What’s at stake for Oilers and NHL in Connor McDavid’s contract talks



Connor McDavid FULL Year-End Press Conference

The future of Edmonton Oilers captain Connor McDavid is the NHL’s hottest offseason storyline. As the 2025-26 season approaches, the superstar forward remains undecided on a contract extension, keeping fans, management, and rivals guessing. Now, fresh insider reports suggest his next deal could set a new benchmark in hockey history — worth as much as $17.5 million per year.NHL insider Frank Seravalli believes McDavid’s next contract could fall in the $16–$17.5 million range annually, with a four-year term emerging as the most likely scenario. “This is a pure spitball; I believe it will be somewhere between $16-17.5 million a year on a four-year deal,” Seravalli said, as reported by NHL Rumors and Bleacher Report.McDavid, 28, is entering the final season of the eight-year, $100 million deal he signed in 2017. Eligible to sign an extension since July 1, the Oilers’ captain has yet to commit, sparking widespread speculation about his long-term plans.Daily Faceoff’s Jason Gregor expects McDavid to eventually re-sign, predicting a five-year agreement with an Average Annual Value (AAV) between $15.5 and $16 million. If finalized, the deal would make McDavid the NHL’s highest-paid player when it takes effect in the 2026–27 season, eclipsing current salary records.Drafted first overall in 2015, McDavid has been the driving force behind Edmonton’s return to Stanley Cup contention, leading them to the Final in recent seasons. His unmatched speed, playmaking, and leadership have made him the face of the franchise and one of the most marketable athletes in the sport.The Oilers’ management has adopted a patient stance, giving McDavid full control over the timing of negotiations.

How John Collison small request for Google Calendar sparked an update



Google Calendar event duplication shortcut: How it works



Key advantages include:

Faster scheduling: Duplicate events without opening multiple menus.

Reduced clicks: Previously, users had to navigate through the three-dot menu to duplicate events—a multi-step process.

Improved productivity: Perfect for busy professionals managing multiple meetings or recurring events, saving time and minimizing scheduling errors effectively.

Current limitations of the Google calendar new update feature



Not available in all views: Users in Schedule or Year view cannot use the drag-and-duplicate feature.

Works only in movable views: The shortcut functions only where events can be dragged or resized directly.

Despite these constraints, the feature saves users valuable time and reduces friction in scheduling tasks.

Google Calendar Shortcut sparks social media buzz as Sundar Pichai responds



Google Calendar shortcut significance for Google Calendar users

A light-hearted exchange on social media between leading tech figures has resulted in a practical update for Google Calendar. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, confirmed that the platform now includes a quick event duplication feature, following a suggestion by Stripe co-founder John Collison just over a month ago. Collison had proposed a Ctrl-click shortcut to instantly copy meetings, similar to features in other calendar tools like Microsoft Outlook. The new functionality allows users to duplicate events by holding Ctrl (or Cmd on Mac) and dragging them in Day, Week, or Month view, eliminating multiple steps previously required. This small but impactful update enhances scheduling efficiency, making recurring or similar appointments faster and more convenient for Google Calendar users.On July 5, John Collison took to X (formerly Twitter) with a simple request for Google Calendar. He asked whether the platform could introduce a shortcut to copy events, similar to features available in Microsoft Outlook and other popular calendar tools. Collison suggested a Ctrl-click function that would instantly duplicate meetings or appointments and tagged Sundar Pichai, ensuring the idea reached the right decision-makers at Google.Unlike most social media requests that disappear into the noise, this one stood out. Pichai responded in kind, announcing that the feature had been implemented in Google Calendar’s web version, delighting users and demonstrating Google’s responsiveness to practical user feedback and productivity-focused suggestions.The new shortcut allows users to hold Ctrl (or Cmd on Mac) and drag an event to another time slot within Day, Week, or Month view, instantly creating a copy.This shortcut makes event duplication in Google Calendar intuitive and efficient, reflecting Google’s focus on enhancing user experience.While the update improves workflow, it’s important to note some limitations:Collison’s suggestion quickly became a talking point on X. Other tech figures joined the conversation, adding a mix of humor and curiosity. Box CEO Aaron Levie jokingly suggested leveraging influence to improve Waymo’s self-driving cars on a congested Silicon Valley route.For everyday Google Calendar users, the shortcut may seem minor but adds tangible convenience, making repetitive scheduling tasks faster and more intuitive. The incident highlights Sundar Pichai’s hands-on approach to social media engagement. Users praised his responsiveness:“Sundar Pichai is out here doing customer service. I love it.”“Hi Sundar, can we log out of one Gmail account at a time instead of all accounts at once?”Pichai’s interactions are consistent with past instances. Earlier in 2025, he responded to Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo about Google Meet audio issues, showing Google’s commitment to addressing user feedback promptly.Even though event duplication in Google Calendar may seem like a small feature, it reflects a larger trend: Google is listening to user feedback and rapidly implementing improvements. By allowing quick duplication of meetings, the platform enhances workflow efficiency and provides users with a smoother scheduling experience.Professionals, teams, and casual users alike benefit from this shortcut, which reduces unnecessary clicks, saves time, and simplifies calendar management.","A light-hearted exchange on social media between leading tech figures has resulted in a practical update for google calendar.

Why the Blackhawks make sense as a landing spot for Carey Price's contract

What Montreal gains — and the steep price they’d pay



The Montreal Canadiens could finally be on the verge of moving Carey Price’s massive contract — and the Chicago Blackhawks might be the team to make it happen. With Price’s deal entering its final year and carrying a $10.5 million cap hit, a proposed trade scenario has emerged that could benefit both sides while reshaping their near-term plans.The Chicago Blackhawks currently sit just over $6 million above the salary cap floor and are expected to move several veterans by the trade deadline. Taking on Carey Price’s contract would give them a financial cushion and strategic flexibility. Analyst Tab Bamford suggests a swap in which Chicago would receive Price’s contract, along with Montreal’s 2026 and 2027 first-round picks, in exchange for goaltender Laurent Brossoit, forward Lukas Reichel, and three second-round picks spread across 2026 and 2027.For Chicago, the move would create a stockpile of draft capital — including three first-rounders in 2026 — giving them “enough ammo to do something significant” in the future. And if the Hawks decide to make a big splash in free agency, Price’s and Shea Weber’s contracts could be placed on LTIR, unlocking more than $18 million in extra cap space.From Montreal’s perspective, adding Brossoit would address a current depth issue behind starter Samuel Montembeault.As Bamford bluntly put it, “Right now, their backup is Kaapo Kahkonen — who is not good.” Brossoit’s career .911 save percentage (.927 last season with Winnipeg) and Stanley Cup-winning experience with Vegas in 2023 make him an immediate upgrade.Reichel, meanwhile, is a 23-year-old former first-round pick who hasn’t found his stride in Chicago. A fresh start in Montreal could unlock his potential, especially in a system eager to develop young forwards.The challenge for the Canadiens would be the heavy draft pick sacrifice — having already moved both 2025 first-rounders in the Noah Dobson trade, losing their ’26 and ’27 selections would test their long-term asset management.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Connor McDavid linked to Maple Leafs and $3.5B Rangers if Oilers extension talks stall Still, if Montreal believes Brossoit and Reichel can contribute immediately, and if shedding Carey Price’s cap hit accelerates their rebuild, this could be the kind of high-risk, high-reward move that changes their trajectory.",The montreal canadiens could finally be on the verge of moving carey price’s massive contract.

Igor Babuschkin , a leading artificial intelligence researcher and one of the founding members of Elon Musk ’s AI startup xAI , has officially announced his departure to launch a new venture focused on AI safety research and responsible innovation. Babuschkin played a pivotal role in shaping xAI’s technical infrastructure, building engineering teams, and overseeing the development of its Grok chatbot.On August 13, 2025, Babuschkin announced his resignation, writing on X: “Today was my last day at xAI, the company that I helped start with Elon Musk in 2023… Building AI that advances humanity has been my lifelong dream.” Elon Musk replied publicly, “Best of luck, Igor,” a cordial farewell that contrasted with Musk’s often tense relationships with departing executives. With his new firm, Babuschkin Ventures , he aims to fund research and startups developing AI systems that advance humanity while ensuring the technology’s safe and ethical deployment in an increasingly competitive global AI landscape.While Babuschkin has kept much of his personal life private, his career trajectory reflects a consistent passion for advanced machine learning systems and the ethical use of technology. He studied computer science and artificial intelligence, developing a strong foundation in deep learning, neural networks, and natural language processing before entering the tech industry’s most competitive AI labs.As reported by Reuters, Babuschkin’s AI journey began at Google DeepMind, one of the world’s most prestigious research labs known for breakthroughs in AlphaGo and protein-folding prediction. As a research engineer, he contributed to projects pushing the boundaries of reinforcement learning and large language models.Later, he joined OpenAI, working on technical infrastructure that powered the organization’s advanced AI models. This experience exposed him to both the incredible potential and serious risks of powerful AI systems — insights that would later shape his philosophy at xAI and beyond.In 2023, Babuschkin became a founding member of xAI, a company Musk envisioned as a transparent and mission-driven alternative to Big Tech AI platforms. He recalled his first meeting with Musk: As per his tweet on X(formerly Twitter) he shared, “We talked for hours about AI and what the future might hold. We both felt that a new AI company with a different kind of mission was needed. Building AI that advances humanity has been my lifelong dream.”At xAI, Babuschkin played a central role in building the company’s infrastructure, assembling engineering teams, and developing foundational tools used to manage large-scale training jobs. One of his signature achievements was overseeing the creation of the Memphis supercluster — a high-performance computing hub powering xAI’s flagship Grok chatbot.Babuschkin revealed plans to start Babuschkin Ventures, a firm dedicated to:His focus marks a pivot from building AI systems to funding projects that ensure AI’s safe deployment — a move aligned with growing global regulatory interest in AI governance.During his tenure, Babuschkin helped xAI achieve rapid operational milestones, including:Despite its technical progress, xAI faced operational controversies during Babuschkin’s time.The Memphis facility powering Grok’s training relied on natural gas-burning turbines, prompting protests from locals who claimed emissions worsened air quality in West Tennessee. Environmental activists demanded cleaner energy alternatives, highlighting concerns about health risks, increased pollution, and the facility’s impact on vulnerable communities nearby.May 2025: Grok generated false claims about “white genocide” in South Africa after an unauthorised modification to its system prompts.July 2025: A code update led Grok to post antisemitic content, including praise for Adolf Hitler.These incidents prompted public apologies from xAI and drew regulatory scrutiny from the European Union.","Igor babuschkin is a leading artificial intelligence researcher and one of the founding members of elon musk ’s ai startup xai.

"China push: In Nepal, EVs now account for 76% of all vehicles sold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/china-push-in-nepal-evs-now-account-for-76-of-all-vehicles-sold/articleshow/122960428.cms,"



KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Ev market share in nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including norway, singapore and ethiopia.

Four men in Northampton, England, raced away from an Indian restaurant without paying their 200-pound (about Rs 21,000) bill, which led to a spectacular chase by the staff. According to a Daily Mail article, the event took place in the Saffron restaurant at around 10.11 pm on August 4.Men can be seen entering the restaurant in the widely circulated CCTV footage posted on Instagram. Later in the video, they can be seen rushing out of the restaurant's door after leaving their table. When they reveal their intent, a staff member may be seen pursuing them. According to the complaint by the eatery, those men ordered and consumed 197.30 pounds of food, which included lamb chops, several curries, and other dishes.The company later posted the bill on Facebook. The bill breakdown included four plain poppadoms for £5.60, one chutney tray for £2.20, two chargrilled lamb chops for £24.00, three chicken chat dishes for £30.00, two chicken tikka mains for £28.00, two chicken tikka masalas for £32.00, two boiled rice portions for £11.00, two garlic naans for £12.00, three chapatis for £12.00, one serving of chips for £4.50, and nine 330 ml glass bottles of Coke for £36.00.Police in Northamptonshire acknowledged that they are looking into the event as a possible theft.""This kind of behavior isn't just theft; it affects hardworking small businesses and our local community,"" they wrote in a Facebook post.Online, the post generated a range of responses. ""Eat at home if you can't afford it! One user asked, ""Why are people these days so lazy to cook?""“This is why you swipe a card before they’re seated.

National strategy







The world's inaugural humanoid robot games commenced Friday in Beijing, featuring over 500 androids competing in events ranging from the 100-metre hurdles to kung fu. Hundreds of robotics teams from 16 countries vied for gold at the Chinese capital's National Speed Skating Oval, constructed for the 2022 Winter Olympics.The games encompassed traditional sports such as athletics and basketball, alongside practical tasks including medicine categorisation and cleaning. ""I believe in the next 10 years or so, robots will be basically at the same level as humans,"" enthusiastic 18-year-old spectator Chen Ruiyuan told AFP.Human athletes may not be intimidated at this stage. During one of the initial events on Friday morning, five-aside football saw ten robots the size of seven-year-olds maneuver around the pitch, frequently becoming entangled in scrums or toppling over en masse.However, in a 1500-metre race, domestic champion Unitree's humanoids maintained an impressive pace, easily surpassing their competitors. The fastest robot AFP observed completed the race in 6:29:37, considerably slower than the human men's world record of 3:26:00. In one incident, a mechanical racer crashed into a human operator. The robot remained upright, while the human was knocked to the ground but did not appear to be injured.Robot competitions have been held for decades, but the 2025 World Humanoid Robot Games marks the first to concentrate specifically on robots that resemble human bodies, organisers stated.The Chinese govt has invested heavily in robotics with the aim of leading the industry. Beijing has placed humanoids at the ""centre of their national strategy,"" the International Federation of Robotics stated in a paper on Thursday.""The govt wants to showcase its competence and global competitiveness in this field of technology,"" it added. Authorities are endeavouring to raise awareness of the sector across society.Cui Han, accompanying her 10-year-old son, told AFP that her son's school had organised and funded the trip to the Games. ""I hope it will encourage him to learn more about these new technologies,"" she said. In March, China announced plans for a one-trillion-yuan (approx Rs 1,22,000 crore) fund to support technology startups, including those in robotics and AI. The country is already the world's largest market for industrial robots, official statistics indicate, and in April, Beijing held what organisers described as the world's first humanoid robot half-marathon.","World's inaugural humanoid robot games commenced friday in beijing, featuring over 500 androids.

Poll Do you think it's fair for authorities to allow loud music while preventing others from performing? Yes, it's unfair No, they should enforce rules equally





A Canadian man stirred debate online after criticising an Indian family for playing loud Punjabi music at a beach in Barrie, Ontario.In the video, shared on Instagram, the man- who goes by @truenorthlooper- described himself as a one-man band and said city authorities had once stopped him from performing at the beach and fined him.He alleged the same authorities now allow others to “blast whatever kind of music they want.”While speaking, he stopped in front of a picnic blanket with bags and a speaker playing Punjabi music. “This is another example of coming down to the beach and blasting whatever kind of music you want and at whatever volume you want. These people are not even here, yet everyone within 150 feet has to listen to this. Great job, City of Barrie,” he said sarcastically.He continued by criticising the authorities for penalising him for playing guitar. “Heaven forbid, I play guitar and raise money for the Barrie Food Bank. That’s a no-no. But yeah, come here and blast whatever music you want, you don’t even have to listen to it, go play in the water while everyone else will have to listen to it,” he added.The video, originally titled “The good, the bad and the ugly reality of the City of Barrie,” resurfaced after being shared by a Canadian Instagram page.The post drew mixed reactions in the comments. Some supported him, writing, “Common courtesy and space for others used to be a thing. I think the due is on point for not disturbing others peace and doing things considering ppl around you.”Another commented, “Welcome to Canada, where immigrants get it all and Canadians with roots are the problem. Elbows up.”Others disagreed. “Go ahead and play your guitar then,” one wrote. Another suggested, “Just go nicely ask them to turn it way down or off… problem solved.
