Poll Was the Coldplay concert incident a breach of professional ethics? Yes, it reflects poor judgment No, it's a personal matter





The defamed CEO of Astronomer Andy Byron, who was placed on leave by the company, after his video canoodling with the HR chief went viral, has tendered his resignation. Astronomer issued a statement Saturday announcing that the Board of of Directors has accepted the resignation. In its statement, Astronomer also reflected how their reputation changed overnight because of the incident and asserted that Astronomer's product and services have not changed.""As stated previously, Astronomer is committed to the values and culture that have guided us since our founding. Our leaders are expected to set the standard in both conduct and accountability, and recently, that standard was not met. Andy Byron has tendered his resignation, and the Board of Directors has accepted. The Board will begin a search for our next Chief Executive as Cofounder and Chief Product Officer Pete DeJoy continues to serve as interim CEO. Before this week, we were known as a pioneer in the DataOps space, helping data teams power everything from modern analytics to production AI.

They were caught on a Jumbotron at the concert as Coldplay's Chris Martin drew the attention of the audience to the canoodling pair.

Chris Martin made it more awkward saying that either they were very shy or they were having an affair.By Thursday morning, the second option proved to be correct as the video of the moment went viral and people identified them as the Astronomer CEO and the chief of HR.The video snowballed into an unprecedented Internet frenzy as social media users looked them up and found out everything about their personal and professional lives.They were placed on leave as Astronomer announced an investigation into the issue and named Pete DeJoy as the acting CEO.",Andy byron and astronomer's hr chief kristin cabot attended the coldplay concert in boston wednesday night.

7 lakh die of sudden cardiac arrest in a year

MUMBAI: India's heart disease burden is evident not only from the spate of heart attacks among young celebrities in the past five years, but also in the over-50% rise in cardiac medication sale in the same period.Be they lipid-lowering drugs, heart-failure medications or anti-anginal treatments, cardiac medications sell more than drugs meant for any complications, including the gastro-intestinal tract, infections or diabetes.According to June report of Pharmarack, which analyses sales figures from 17 prominent Indian pharmaceutical companies representing more than half of the sector, sales of cardiac medicines rose from Rs 1,761 crore in June 2021 to Rs 2,645 crore by June 2025. There has been a consistent yearly growth rate of 10.7% in this sector, showed the report.Experts offer a slew of reasons for this rise, ranging from better awareness of heart diseases, new parameters for measuring hypertension as well as the increasing population of senior citizens. “There is no doubt that cardiovascular diseases are on the rise, but at the same time, access to care and diagnostic tools has improved,"" said Dr Ajay Mahajan, head of the cardiology department at KEM Hospital.Centre's data suggests that 63% of total deaths in the country were due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs), with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) accounting for 27%.Dr Suraj Nagre, associate professor at JJ Hospital's cardiovascular and thoracic surgery department, offers another reason: “A few years ago, the threshold for hypertension was a reading of 130-140. Medical guidelines have since changed and even readings above 120 are considered hypertensive.”While heart care until a few years back mainly meant lipid-lowering medications, the prescriptions for other drugs meant to control unstable heart rhythm or heart failure have also increased. “Cardiovascular medications are interrelated because they target different but connected pathways of disease,” said senior cardiac surgeon Dr Ramakanta Panda. “For example, anti-hypertensives lower blood pressure to reduce the strain on arteries and the heart. Lipid-lowering drugs like statins reduce cholesterol helping prevent arterial blockages. Anti-anginals improve blood flow to the heart muscle, relieving chest pain caused by narrowed arteries. These medications are often prescribed together,"" said Dr Panda.Referring to the frequent reports of cardiac arrest deaths among common people as well as celebrities and fitness enthusiasts, KEM cardiologist Dr Charan Lanjewar said underlying factors are almost always involved. “There’s a lack of data to identify a single cause in many cardiac arrest cases. The reasons are multifactorial, but lifestyle, stress, and consumption habits play a vital role,” Dr Lanjewar said.The aging population is more prone to heart conditions. Senior cardiologist Dr Akshay Mehta said, “The lifespan of the Indian population has increased and with a growing aging population, we are seeing a higher incidence of heart disease. Along with rising incidence, we also have better diagnostic tools now.”","Sales of cardiac medicines rose from rs 1,761 crore in june 2021 to rs 2,645 crore by june 2025.

During his performance at the Barclays Centre, Tyler, the Creator shocked his audience by revealing his latest studio album, Don't Tap the Glass. He later uploaded the same on his Instagram. Meanwhile, the NBA legend LeBron James later posted the same on his Instagram Story. Additionally, he also co-signed the brand-new record, Don't Tap the Glass, last week.Don't Tap the Glass, Tyler, the Creator’s ninth studio album, will be released on Monday, July 21, 2025.

He uploaded the same on his Instagram with the caption:“TOMORROW… 6am EST… DONT TAP THE GLASS..”The post was later shared by NBA legend LeBron James on his Instagram Story. He recently co-signed the new album Don't Tap the Glass, demonstrating his respect for the creator.As soon as the post was uploaded, it swiftly went viral. Although the two legends have acknowledged one another before, this serves as a stark reminder of how their influence transcends all sectors.The singer, however, has a clear philosophy that explains why he favors early-week releases. As per Complex, he explained his point of view in an interview with Nardwuar in 2023. He claimed:“I think we should put music out again on Tuesdays instead of Fridays, for some reasons..My reasoning is, I know people think because of the weekend, they can listen to stuff, and the streams go up. And the streaming people are like, ‘Oh, the streams go up on the weekend!’ But I think it’s a lot of passive listening, at parties or people get the time to go to the gym, so they’re not really listening.”He added:“To work on an album for so long and put so much energy into it and for it to be released at midnight…just seems so disrespectful.”This evolving relationship between LeBron James and Tyler, the Creator, showcases how artists and athletes amplify each other’s cultural influence. Whether or not they have official collaborations planned, the singer’s presence in the NBA icon’s orbit speaks volumes.Also read: LeBron James may retire after 2025-26 season as Los Angeles Lakers delay extension","Lebron james co-signed tyler, the creator’s album don't tap the glass.

What are 'Kiss Cams'

Who are Andy Byron and Kristin Cabot

A 'Kiss Cam' moment broadcast at a Coldplay concert Astronomer CEO Andy Byron and the firm’s chief human resources officer, Kristin Cabot. While featuring loved-up twosomes during the show, a camera panned over to a man who had his arms wrapped tightly around a woman, according to videos online. As soon as the two realised that they were on camera, the dup scrambled to hide their faces. The man, later identified as Andy Bryon, immediately ducked out of view while the woman, Kristin Cabot , hid her face in apparent embarrassment.Their reaction seems to have puzzled Chris Martin, the lead singer of Coldplay, who jokingly said, ""Oh, look at these two. You're all right. You're OK. Oh, what? Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy.""So what are these ""Kiss Cams"" that outed the tech CEO's affair. 'Kiss Cams' at concerts, like those seen at Coldplay shows, are a popular form of audience engagement and entertainment during breaks or lulls in the main performance. Much like those at sporting events, 'Kiss Cams' are a popular interactive segment designed to entertain the audience during lulls or breaks in the show. A camera operator scans the crowd, displaying random audience members on the large video screens (jumbotrons) in the stadium or arena. When the camera zooms in on a pair, the unspoken expectation is for them to share a kiss, often to the cheers and applause of the crowd.While intended as light-hearted fun and a way to foster communal enjoyment, these moments can sometimes lead to unexpected reactions, ranging from shy giggles to viral, awkward encounters. As seen in recent events, frontman Chris Martin might even playfully comment on the on-screen interactions, adding to the impromptu entertainment. The 'Kiss Cam' serves as a simple yet effective tool to engage thousands of concertgoers, transforming passive spectators into active participants in a memorable moment.As per his LinkedIn profile, Andy Byron has been CEO of Astronomer since July 2023. Before this, he has held senior-level roles at cybersecurity and software companies. The US-based Astronomer is valued at $1 billion.

Is Yellowstone’s supervolcano about to erupt? Truth and rumours behind the viral bear video,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-yellowstones-supervolcano-about-to-erupt-truth-and-rumours-behind-the-viral-bear-video/articleshow/122799594.cms,"The viral bear video and Yellowstone supervolcano panic: where it actually came from

Yellowstone supervolcano’s current volcanic status

Are hydrothermal changes a cause for concern?

What scientists expect before a real eruption

A sharp increase in earthquake frequency and magnitude

Broad and rapid ground uplift

Elevated emissions of volcanic gases like sulphur dioxide

Unusual heat patterns across large areas

The reality of Yellowstone’s eruption cycle

Final word: Yellowstone remains safe





Yellowstone National Park has once again become the centre of global attention, not because of its geysers or wildlife, but due to viral social media claims suggesting an imminent supervolcano eruption. A widely circulated video appears to show a group of bears “fleeing” the park, stirring alarm across platforms like TikTok and Instagram. Users speculated that the animals were reacting to seismic activity beneath the surface. However, scientific evidence and expert monitoring tell a very different story. As of July 2025, the US Geological Survey and Yellowstone Volcano Observatory report no signs of impending volcanic unrest. Here’s a closer look at what’s really happening beneath Yellowstone’s surface — and what isn’t.The now-viral bear video, which triggered fears of an impending eruption, has been thoroughly debunked.Contrary to claims, the footage was not filmed in Yellowstone. It originated in January 2025 at Bear Country USA, a wildlife park in Rapid City, South Dakota. Wildlife experts confirm that the bears shown were part of a controlled, fenced environment and were not exhibiting unusual behaviour.Animal migrations in Yellowstone show no signs of panic. Experts note that bears and other animals tend to follow seasonal patterns, and there’s been no verified mass exodus from the park.The Yellowstone supervolcano remains at background levels of activity.According to the USGS and Yellowstone Volcano Observatory, the volcano alert level is NORMAL, and the aviation colour code is GREEN. These designations indicate that seismic and geothermal activity are within expected norms.In June 2025, 60 small earthquakes were recorded in the region. The largest measured magnitude 2.7 — well within Yellowstone's historical patterns and not linked to heightened volcanic risk. Regular geothermal features such as geysers and hot springs continue to operate without any unusual changes.Hydrothermal activity in Yellowstone is dynamic and constantly changing.Events like a new hydrothermal vent forming in Biscuit Basin (July 2024) or minor steam explosions are not uncommon. These phenomena result from shallow underground water interactions and do not suggest deeper magma movement.USGS scientists clarify that such changes, while sometimes dramatic, are part of Yellowstone’s geothermal landscape and are not considered precursors to a supervolcano eruption.If Yellowstone were approaching a major eruption, multiple early warning signs would occur.Experts expect precursors like:None of these indicators are currently present. Continuous monitoring through GPS, seismic networks, and gas sensors provides scientists with real-time data capable of detecting any significant changes.The last supervolcanic eruption at Yellowstone occurred around 640,000 years ago.While some speculate on eruption intervals, scientists stress that supervolcanoes do not follow predictable schedules. Estimates suggest no such eruption is due for at least another 60,000 years.Recent studies also show the magma chamber beneath Yellowstone is not as full or pressurised as previously believed, further lowering the likelihood of sudden catastrophic activity.Despite social media rumours, there is no scientific basis for fears of an imminent Yellowstone supervolcano eruption.The viral bear video was misleading and not filmed in the park. Experts remain vigilant through advanced monitoring systems and have found no signs of escalating volcanic hazard.Yellowstone continues to be a safe destination for visitors, with its geothermal marvels and wildlife providing awe and inspiration — minus the eruption panic.","Despite social media rumours, there is no scientific basis for fears of an imminent yellowstone supervolcano eruption.

Extreme mountain biker and social media influencer Andreas Tonelli lost his life in a biking accident on July 15 while riding alone in the Vallelunga area of Val Gardena, located in Italy’s South Tyrol region.The 48-year-old was navigating a steep and difficult section of alpine terrain when the incident occurred. He had set out for a late afternoon solo ride, according to the reports by the Italian media.Known for his daring mountain adventures, Tonelli had over 120,000 Instagram followers.His last Instagram story, posted at 7.15 PM, showed him reaching the 2,905-metre summit of Piz Duleda, smiling with his bike slung over his shoulder, against the dramatic backdrop of the valley below.Concerns were raised when Tonelli failed to return by nightfall. A friend, who had begun searching on his own, alerted authorities shortly after 9.00 PM.A search operation was launched by Alpine rescue teams and the Aiut Alpin helicopter, which scoured the mountainous region despite deteriorating weather.Around 1.00 AM, rescuers spotted Tonelli’s lifeless body in a deep ravine - an area that proved difficult to access in the dark and amid heavy rainfall and freezing temperatures.His body was eventually recovered the following morning, reported L’Unione Sarda.The exact cause of the fall, estimated to be around 200 metres, remains under investigation by the Carabinieri, given the solo nature of his ride and the lack of witnesses.The biking community and fans across the world mourned the loss of the rider. Norrøna, the premium outdoor apparel brand for which Tonelli was an ambassador, expressed deep sorrow in a social media post.“Andreas was a passionate, dedicated, and important voice within the Norrøna family… We will remember his big smile and his deep love for mountain biking, for nature, and for the friendships forged out there,” the brand wrote.“He made a profound impression on everyone fortunate enough to meet him,” it added.Tonelli was not just a face for the brand, but also actively involved in product testing and development, and served as a bike guide for Norrøna Adventure, where he shared his passion for cycling with guests from around the world.Often described as a “true gentleman,” Tonelli was admired not only for his technical prowess on difficult terrains but also for his humble personality and love for the mountains. His adventurous spirit inspired many through his social media content, which often featured high-altitude rides across the Alps and Dolomites.","Mountain biker and social media influencer andreas tonelli lost his life in a biking accident on july 15.

A group of Chinese students has captured global attention after successfully launching a homemade two-stage water rocket built from a simple cola bottle. The launch, powered by water pressure, shows the rocket soaring into the sky, separating mid-air, and deploying a parachute for a safe landing. A video of the launch has gone viral, drawing widespread admiration for the students’ creativity, teamwork, and technical skills.The video was shared on X by user Tansu Yegen with the caption, “In China, students made a two-stage rocket using a cola bottle and water pressure.Since being posted, the clip has garnered over 1.2 million views.Using basic materials like plastic bottles and water, the students engineered a rocket based on air and water pressure principles. In the launch, the first stage propelled the rocket upward using pressurized water.At a certain altitude, the second stage separated and continued its ascent using stored pressure. A parachute then deployed, allowing the rocket to descend safely, demonstrating complex physics concepts such as Newton’s laws of motion, air resistance, and pressure.Social media users, particularly from India, flooded the comments with praise and introspection.One user wrote, “And we are still struggling with basic education and basic necessities for our citizens,” while another said, “Aur hamare yaha ke bacche..”A retired engineering teacher added to the discussion, saying, “I’ve probably seen 5,000 water rocket launches in the past 25 years.

A restaurant in northern China has sparked outrage after offering customers the chance to cuddle lion cubs while enjoying afternoon tea.Animal welfare groups and social media users are slamming the experience as exploitative and dangerous.The Wanhui restaurant is situated in Taiyuan City in Shanxi province. It allows guests to handle the young lions as part of a four-course tea set, priced at 1,078 yuan ($150). Since opening in June, the venue has been selling around 20 tickets daily for the experience, which also features other animals such as llamas, deer, and turtles. Videos and photos of customers cradling the lion cubs have gone viral on Chinese social media platforms like WeChat and Weibo.Animal rights advocates have condemned the practice, warning of both ethical and safety concerns. “Tearing lion cubs from their mothers so diners can handle them over afternoon tea is exploitation, not entertainment. These animals are living, feeling beings, not toys,” Jason Baker, Senior vice president at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), told news agency Reuters.Baker also criticised the trend of using animals for viral content, adding, “The animals were treated like nothing more than social media props.”Peter Li, a policy expert on China for Humane World for Animals, also raised concerns about the risks involved. “Exploiting wild animals for selfies and marketing gimmicks is not only appallingly bad animal welfare, it's also potentially risky for customers,” he was quoted as saying to Reuters. “Even a young lion is capable of lashing out and injuring a human. So, treating wild animals like props is both morally unacceptable and dangerously irresponsible. ”Despite the backlash, the restaurant has defended itself, claiming the cubs are in good health and under professional care. “They were taken care of very well, with specialised carers to tend to them,” a representative told Reuters.This incident follows another controversial hospitality service in China last month, when authorities launched an investigation into a hotel in Chongqing for its so-called “wake-up service” using red pandas. The animals were allowed to climb onto guests’ beds to rouse them in the mornings, drawing similar criticism from animal rights groups.","A restaurant in northern china has sparked outrage after offering customers the chance to cuddle lion cubs while enjoying afternoon tea.

Owning a car in Dubai has always been a symbol of status and convenience, but for many residents, especially expats with short- to medium-term plans in the UAE, leasing offers a smarter and more flexible alternative. In 2025, as the city's population continues to diversify and commute preferences evolve, leasing options have become more accessible, diverse, and financially appealing. Car leasing not only allows residents to access the latest models without a hefty down payment but also provides a worry-free experience with inclusive maintenance and insurance coverage. This guide walks you through the comprehensive process of leasing a car in Dubai, what to expect, the documents required, and how to choose the right leasing plan based on your needs.The UAE's dynamic job market, especially in cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi, means that many residents are on short-term contracts or are uncertain about their long-term stay. Buying a car, while giving ownership, involves high upfront costs, insurance, maintenance, and depreciation risks. Leasing, by contrast, offers a predictable monthly expense without the burdens of ownership.Leasing companies in Dubai typically bundle costs like insurance, maintenance, servicing, and registration renewal into the monthly payment.This simplifies budgeting and provides peace of mind, especially for expats who prefer financial predictability. Furthermore, leasing allows residents to drive newer models more frequently, as contracts can range between one to five years, with options to upgrade once the lease term ends.There are several leasing structures available, tailored to different needs and financial profiles. The most common is the traditional leasing model, where you lease a car for a fixed period, generally between 12 and 60 months, after which the car is returned to the leasing company.Another increasingly popular model is the lease-to-own option. In this arrangement, a portion of the monthly lease payment contributes towards eventual ownership of the vehicle. Once the lease period ends, the customer can purchase the car by paying a pre-agreed residual value. Companies like Carlease Dubai specialize in such agreements, providing flexibility for residents who may want to keep the car long-term without committing upfront.Additionally, some companies offer no-deposit leases, which allow customers to lease a vehicle without placing a substantial security deposit. However, these plans typically have higher monthly payments and may include stricter mileage limits or fewer model options.Leasing costs in Dubai vary significantly depending on the car category, lease term, and inclusions in the contract. As of July 2025, economy cars such as the Nissan Sunny or Toyota Yaris typically start at around AED 1,200 to AED 1,600 per month for a 12-month lease.
