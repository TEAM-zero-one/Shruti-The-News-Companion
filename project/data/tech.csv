'All of them are some distance away': CDS Anil Chauhan's take on China's sixth-generation fighter aircrafts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/all-of-them-are-some-distance-away-cds-anil-chauhans-take-on-chinas-sixth-generation-fighter-aircrafts/articleshow/118179831.cms,"China's NEW 6th Gen Fighter Took its First Successful Flight

The Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan on Wednesday raised doubts over China's claims about their sixth-generation fighter aircraft, stating that these aircraft are still under development.CDS Chauhan, when questioned about Chinese sixth-generation fighter jet claims, told news agency ANI that while numerous nations are working on sixth-generation programmes, he personally believes all are considerably far from completion. He suggested that nations might be displaying these technologies as part of their tactical approach.""It's very difficult to see these kinds of platforms with six-generation capability. What we are talking about is by external viewing of an aircraft and that too with a few seconds clip which will not give you an idea that this is six generation aircraft. In fact, a large number of countries are pursuing a six-generation program and that's my personal belief that all of them are some distance away. But sometime back we had heard about the capabilities of WS 10 or WS 15 engines which are there on 5th generation aircraft for the Chinese,"" General Chauhan said.""Sometime back, we had also heard about Chinese hiring a number of ex-pilots of the American and the British Air Force. They wanted to refine their drills and their systems, so they just show that they're still in that kind of a development stage. Not only as far as technology is concerned, but also tactics is concerned. So we are there. We have a program for AMCA that's a 5th generation fighter, so that's somewhere down the line. But we are there,"" he added.Additionally, General Chauhan explained his perspective on sixth-generation aircraft, describing it as a platform capable of both manned and unmanned operations .""My understanding of a sixth generation aircraft is that there is no proper globally accepted definition of what a sixth generation aircraft is. Basically, a sixth generation aircraft is a platform which can perform both manned and unmanned teaming. It is kind of an aerial command post which can take control of 2-3 similar kinds of assets, maybe UAVs, maybe drones which are sound drones and then put a combat in a different kind of a manner,"" he said.CDS Chauhan said that such aircraft would incorporate various technologies, including networks, data analytics and artificial intelligence to enhance the pilot's decision-making capabilities during combat situations.""So that's the kind of concept of six-generation and it involves number of technologies. It will involve networks, data analytics which will provide that kind of situation awareness to that pilot over there and also command and control of all the assets. He should be able to network himself or spar passage of information through terrestrial or say aerial networks. It will also use artificial intelligence to give him that better decision making ability during combat. It also will have maybe long range smart air-to-air missiles, weapon systems and apart from that stealth technology with self-healing kind of capabilities,"" he concluded.","Chief of defence staff (cds) general anil chauhan raised doubts over china's claims about their sixth-generation fighter aircraft.

According to Bloomberg, the Top 20 Richest Families in Asia 2025 are privileged to be led by Mukesh Ambani, the Chairman and CEO of Reliance Industries, who continues to maintain a giant lead in wealth, thereby firmly ensuring his place as the richest person in Asia. Under Ambani, many other notable Indian and Asian business families also appear high on the list, showing their deployment of influence across various industries. From diversified conglomerates to global leaders in energy, technology, and finance, these families exhibit wealth creation through entrepreneurship.Bloomberg Thursday announced Mukesh Ambani, Chairman, and Chief Executive Officer of Reliance Industries, as the richest individual in the Asian continent, according to his report on the 20 Richest Families in Asia. Ambani took over the company a year after the passing of Dhirubhai Ambani, his father, in 2002. Once under her watch, it went on to expand as an oil-refining multinational conglomerate with interests in technology, consumer goods, financial services, and, most recently, green energy. The Ambani family from Gujarat is believed to manage the business, with Mukesh Ambani's children playing a big role in managing different arms of the conglomerate.Shapoorji Pallonji Group has ample presence in various industries, cementing a huge shareholding interest in Tata Sons, which is managing the $400 billion Tata Group, highly regarded as one of India’s largest and most powerful conglomerates. The Mistrys have been part and parcel of the Tata legacy, nurturing it for decades through their growth and leadership once in operations.The Jindal family got into business with the commissioning of a steel plant in 1952. Over the years, the family business under the O.P. Jindal Group has grown into a diversified conglomerate, now active in energy, cement, and sports. The Jindals maintain a significant presence in many sectors due to their adaptability and evolution.The Birla family has a long business lineage that traverses the 19th century. The Aditya Birla Group, led by Kumar Mangalam Birla, remains the driving force in industries like metals, financial services, and retail. The family has kept with its legacy as one of India's great business families that have helped in developing the nation's economy.Bajaj was founded in 1926, which then built the initial business around scooter technology. From there, Bajaj Group diversified into cement, electrical appliances, etc. Rahul Bajaj has been a leader in working the business landscape with prosperity and growth.The Hindujas entered the business in 1914 through trading and banking. Over the years, the Hinduja Group has gradually evolved as a diversified global conglomerate with interests in energy, automotive, finance, and healthcare. The operations of this family are now across continents, being able to make substantial business transactions in Mumbai, London, and Geneva.","Bloomberg announced mukesh ambani, chairman, and chief executive officer of reliance industries, as the richest individual in the asian continent.

UK Home Buying Selling Reforms: UK to digitise property sales for faster transactions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/fit-for-21st-century-uk-to-digitise-property-sales-for-faster-transactions/articleshow/118106621.cms,"Long homebuying process in UK

The UK government is planning to digitise property sales data to speed up home purchases and reduce delays, The Guardian reports.A 12-week initiative has been launched to create standardised rules for data sharing among conveyancers, lenders, and others involved in transactions.Currently, much of the process relies on paper documents or outdated systems, causing delays. The changes aim to improve information sharing and make the process more efficient.""We are streamlining the cumbersome homebuying process so that it is fit for the 21st century, helping homebuyers save money, gain time, and reduce stress while also cutting the number of house sales that fall through,"" housing and planning minister Matthew Pennycook was quoted as saying, according to The Guardian.The initiative is part of a wider housing reform plan, including changes to planning rules, building 1.5 million homes, and leasehold reforms.Buying a home in the UK typically takes months, with delays caused by conveyancing, property searches, and document retrieval.According to Rightmove, the UK's largest online real estate portal, it takes an average of five months from offer acceptance to moving in.Rightmove CEO Johan Svanstrom explained that this follows an initial two-month period for property selection and offer agreement. He added: ""The current process also contributes to an average of more than one in five home sales falling through, and hopefully a better process can help reduce this as well.""The ministry of housing, communities and local government says full digitalisation will allow instant access to information for mortgage providers and surveyors, with single identity verification.Right now, important documents like building control and highways records are mostly on paper. Delays also happen because there are no standardised protocols for accessing and verifying electronic data.To improve this, the ministry is working with HM Land Registry (HMLR) and experts from the Digital Property Market Steering Group.HMLR will lead 10-month pilot projects with councils to test digital data sharing. Plans also include digital identity verification to speed up transactions.New leasehold legislation taking effect on March 3 will give leaseholders more control over service charge costs and remove their obligation to pay freeholder legal fees for right-to-manage claims.These changes could save leaseholders up to £3,000 on legal costs and reduce landlord obstruction tactics.Pennycook said the reforms will help leaseholders ""more easily and cheaply take control of the buildings they live in and clamp down on unreasonable or extortionate charges.""","The uk government is planning to digitise property sales data to speed up home purchases.

Takeaways: Tesla has sued Chinese customers and journalists and won almost every time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/takeaways-tesla-has-sued-chinese-customers-and-journalists-and-won-almost-every-time/articleshow/118180992.cms,"In this photo, Zhang Yazhou sits on the roof of her damaged Tesla Model 3 with a bullhorn outside a Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou (Image credits: AP)

Tesla did not return requests for comment. Here are some key things to know about Tesla's success in China:

Media coverage of Tesla in China is constrained

BEIJING: Tesla has embraced an aggressive legal strategy in China to stifle its critics suing its own customers.That's left some Tesla owners desperate. Zhang Yazhou protested publicly that her Model 3's brakes had failed and caused an accident in 2021 that sent her parents to the hospital. Tesla said that wasn't true and sued her for defamation. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay the $1.1-trillion company more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize for her criticism.""I refuse to accept it,"" said Zhang, who appealed the verdict. ""As a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.""As concerns mount about eroding checks and balances in the US, Tesla's record in China shows how it has thrived in a system where regulators, the courts and media all answer to the ruling Communist Party.It's not common for automakers in China or elsewhere to sue their own customers. But Tesla has done so successfully in China, where Elon Musk 's company has used the courts and the patronage of a powerful leader to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.Musk has a powerful patron in China Tesla's commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China's premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping . Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China's financial capital under his watch in 2019.With Li's support, Tesla was the first foreign automaker allowed to retain complete control over its China venture. Tesla got low-interest loans, tax breaks, favorable regulatory changes and other benefits.In January 2020, Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. That year, Tesla turned an annual profit for the first time in its history and Musk was soon declared the world's richest person.Musk's ""greater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,"" said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd, an advisory firm based in Shanghai. ""He's done a good job of it in China, and he's done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.""Requests for comment to the state council, which is run by Li Qiang, went unanswered.Tesla has had an impressive winning streak in Chinese courts Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures.The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review of public court documents and Chinese media reports by The Associated Press.Tesla won all eleven cases for which AP could determine the verdicts. Two judgments are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it has also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgments in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.While some industry experts say it's generally difficult for customers to win such cases, others say it's remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.""For Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,"" said Russo, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. ""The odds are stacked against you. It's like going to the casino and winning every hand.""In a statement to AP, the Shanghai high people's court said that judgements are the result of a ""fair trial.""""It cannot be assumed that the party has received 'special protection' or 'special treatment' because of their victory,"" the court wrote.Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.""We were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,"" a tech reporter told AP.Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk's company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. PingWest had to apologize for a report that claimed Tesla's Shanghai factory was a ""sweatshop"" and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). The AP could not determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com, which drew Tesla's ire after writing about the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla.Electric vehicle giant BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors in going after car owners who suffered crashes.""Tesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,"" said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,000) after he wrote about Tesla's alleged brake failures. ""Tesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.""","Tesla's success in china has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: li qiang, the former party boss of shanghai who is now china's premier.

Harry Bolz Meaning: Elon Musk changes his X (formerly Twitter) profile name to Harry Bolz: What does it mean?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musk-changes-ex-name-to-harry-bolz-what-does-it-mean/articleshow/118146142.cms,"What Does Harry Bōlz Mean?

April 2023: The ‘Harry Bōlz’ Incident

December 2024: ‘Kekius Maximus’ and Internet Subcultures

Why Does Musk Change His Name?

Humour and Entertainment – Many of Musk’s social media antics, including his name changes, seem intended to amuse both himself and his audience.

Cultural References – He frequently taps into online trends and memes, demonstrating his awareness of internet subcultures.

Disruptive Marketing – By generating discussions around his name changes, Musk keeps attention on his X profile and maintains engagement with his audience.

Elon Musk changed his X account name to Harry Bōlz on Tuesday, marking the second time he has adopted this alias. The billionaire had briefly used the same handle in April 2023. His latest stunt comes just hours after reports emerged that a Musk-led consortium of investors has placed a bid to take control of OpenAI.The 53-year-old, who heads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is currently making cuts across multiple federal agencies in an effort to reduce government spending.Musk likely used the name as a play on words, referencing the slang term ‘hairy balls’. While the reason behind his latest name change remains unclear, Musk previously explained the joke in a tweet back in 2023.Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur and owner of X (formerly Twitter), is well known for his unpredictable and often humorous online behaviour. Among his many quirks is a habit of changing his display name on the platform, sometimes as a joke and other times as a cryptic nod to internet culture. While Musk has altered his name multiple times, two notable instances stand out—his brief use of “Harry Bōlz” in April 2023 and “Kekius Maximus” in December 2024.In April 2023, Musk changed his display name on X to ""Harry Bōlz."" At the time, the reasoning behind this move was not immediately clear. However, it was widely interpreted as a joke, playing on the phonetic similarity to “hairy balls,” a slang term often used in internet humour.Musk is no stranger to wordplay and internet memes, frequently engaging in online jokes and trolling. His use of ""Harry Bōlz"" fit well within his typical approach to social media, where he enjoys posting lighthearted, and sometimes controversial, content. This name change also followed a period of heightened attention on Musk’s management of X, as he had taken over the platform in late 2022 and made several sweeping changes, including layoffs and policy updates.While Musk did not provide a detailed explanation for the name change at the time, he later addressed it in a tweet, confirming that it was indeed a joke. The name was short-lived, as Musk quickly reverted to his usual display name.On December 31, 2024, Musk once again changed his display name, this time to ""Kekius Maximus."" Alongside the name change, he updated his profile picture to an image of Pepe the Frog dressed as a Roman gladiator.The term ""Kekius Maximus"" is a reference to ""kek,"" a term popularised in online gaming and internet meme culture. Originating from World of Warcraft, ""kek"" became associated with internet communities, particularly those engaged in political memes and satire. The name ""Maximus"" is a reference to ancient Roman culture, evoking the title of a powerful general or emperor.By adopting ""Kekius Maximus,"" Musk was making a playful nod to these internet subcultures. The move sparked discussion among his followers, as some saw it as a lighthearted joke, while others speculated that Musk was aligning himself with certain meme-driven online movements. His use of Pepe the Frog, a character that has been widely used in memes across different communities, added another layer of interpretation to his display name change.Musk's tendency to change his display name on X aligns with his broader online persona. He has often embraced internet culture, meme humour, and trolling, using X as a platform to engage with his followers in an informal and often unpredictable manner.

Profits came out to $20 billion while earnings per share reached $1.86, higher than the $1.49 that analysts surveyed by FactSet had anticipated.But the company said it expected revenue for the current quarter to be between $151 billion and 155.5 billion, lower than the $158.56 billion that analysts were expecting. The guidance anticipates ""an unusually large, unfavorable impact"" from foreign exchange rates, it said.Amazon is the biggest online shopping destination in the U.S. and has long been a beneficiary of consumer spending during the holidays. As it has done in recent years, the company in October began offering promotions intended to lure early holiday shoppers. It advertised other discounts during the three-month period, including on major sales days such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.Amazon on Thursday reported it saw $75.5 billion in revenue for its online shopping business, up 7% from the same period in 2023.Across the retail industry, holiday sales in November and December were better than expected compared with the previous year as lower inflation on holiday goods enticed shoppers to buy, according to The National Retail Federation. Online shopping also saw record sales levels, Adobe Analytics reported in January.Sales for Amazon Web services, the company's prominent cloud computing unit, rose 19% during the fourth quarter. But it fell slightly below analysts expectations.Amazon is one of the biggest players in the competitive tech race around generative artificial intelligence. Like other tech companies, it has ramped up investments in the technology and is spending billions to expand data centers that support AI and cloud computing. The company is also spending money on other equipment, including its own computer chips and those developed by Nvidia. It has also rolled out its own AI models and integrated the generative AI into other parts of its business.In the fourth quarter, Amazon reported spending $27.8 billion on property and equipment, significantly higher than the same period in 2023. Most of the spending was geared towards AI and AWS, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during a call with analysts on Thursday.""We think virtually every application that we know of today is going to be re-invented with AI inside of it,"" Jassy said. ""I think both our business, our customers and shareholders will be happy medium-to-long term that we're pursuing the capital opportunity and the business opportunity in AI.""Jassy also said during the call that Amazon, like many others, was ""impressed"" by DeepSeek, the Chinese artificial intelligence company whose chatbot recently became the most downloaded app in the U.S.Amazon's quarterly report also comes as the retail industry is absorbing a new 10% tariff President Donald Trump imposed on Chinese imports on Tuesday. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been put on hold for about a month.Trump also thew out a trade exemption that allowed low-value shipments from China to bypass duties, a loophole that had given an advantage to China-founded e-commerce firms, such as Shein and Temu.The new tariffs could benefit Amazon by increasing costs for its competitors. But it would also impact Chinese sellers who connect with American consumers on the company's shopping platform. Furthermore, it could raise prices on a recently-launched online storefront that Amazon set up to ship low-cost products directly from China. The storefront, called Amazon Haul, was Amazon's answer to Shein and Temu.Additionally, analysts from Morgan Stanley wrote in a Monday note that Amazon's first-party retail business, though which the company sells products purchased from manufacturers, has the highest exposure to the tariffs. The analysts estimate 25% of the merchandise sold through that business comes from China.","Amazon reported better-than-expected revenue and profits for the holiday shopping period.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume.While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.",The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Carbon capture and utilization could be an important tool in the fight against climate change. Most companies working on co2-sequestering products are still in their infancy.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-633411,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
