AI psychosis

: Access or Abyss

Stepping outside the AI echo chamber

They swear it’s harmless — just curiosity, just another buzz on the phone. But somewhere between the late-night replies and the uncanny comfort of being “heard,” a quiet shift has begun.AI assistants, once designed purely for utility, are slowly becoming mirrors, confidants and emotional anchors.People now talk to chatbots like therapists, partners and best friends, forging bonds that feel sticky, addictive and eerily comforting.Across cities and bedrooms, people are forming strange, sticky bonds with their AI “best friends,” connections far deeper and more private than they’ll ever admit.Somewhere in that quiet space between code and confession, the line between imagination and reality has started to blur.And as this revolution settles into everyday life, one question grows harder to ignore: who’s shaping whom?All those sci-fi movies promised us flying cars, holograms and robot butlers.What we actually received was quieter — and far more invasive.Instead of machines lifting our physical burdens, we have systems that lift, rearrange and sometimes replace our mental loads.What felt miraculous at first now carries a strange psychological aftertaste.Supraja Jayshankaran, the founder and counselling psychologist at Mind Tattva shares how people have been developing an emotional dependency on AI chatbots.“I encounter clients who have been chatting and relying on AI as their partner or therapist. It's so common to see such clients day in and out,” she shares, “The clients have shared that when they are bored, when they are in distress, when they are confused they seek immediate attention and answers from AI, simply because AI apps are now at the tap of your finger and generate close to realistic answers and sometimes comforts them instead of asking them to confront their emotions , thoughts and feelings. ”Whatever lived in your head could appear on your screen with almost no friction. Need a 3,000-word article by midnight? Just describe it. The college assignment that is way past its due date to even panic about? Offload the stress to your AI.Then came the wave of image generation that has not stopped to date. Be it the pioneer Ghibli trend, the nano banana or the Polaroid with your younger self. Simple prompts being actively shared in the public discourse unlocked the universe of visualising oneself in anything the mind could imagine.This is, of course, the Artificial Intelligence revolution.The gap between fascination and visualization reduced when one request made every loved memory become a part of the Ghibli universe.The Nano banana trend followed shortly after. People recreating their pictures as these 3D figurines, making real-life action figures out of themselves.Portraits with one’s younger self built a bridge that had only ever been imagined. The visualization became a quiet, healing conversation.This is what artificial intelligence enables.However, when we look beyond these trends, AI also shows its ability to fabricate convincing false realities. Image generation has become so precise that people now question the authenticity of nearly every picture they encounter online.So how did we travel this far, this fast, and where exactly are we headed?Before attempting an answer, pause for a small experiment. Here are a bunch of images. Try and decode which ones are AI and which ones a real image.How many did you get right? Let’s make it a little easy for you. Every single one of these were AI generated.When everything feels real, nothing seems trustworthy anymore.Somewhere along the way, the word “AI” itself slipped into slang territory, a shorthand for something uncanny, unreal or ‘too perfect to be true.’ Those comments you see online that go, “I showed this to my dad, he says it is AI,” capture the absurdity of it all.The very tool that was supposed to bridge imagination and reality has now become something driving us away from both.With time, the artificial intelligence that distinctly stood out for its distortions began picking up the pace. The technology sharpened, scaled and spread. Just like the boom of social media redefining the idea of persona, sending people to extreme lengths for that picture-perfect life. AI too distorted the realities.Today, people are not just querying chatbots for answers about history or code. They have a companion that can roleplay any conversation. Yashashvi Vasistha shares what made him chat with the AI.“Recently, while planning a trip to Jagannath Puri, I created an itinerary with ChatGPT after doing my own research. But since it was my first time travelling that far, I still felt unsure about whether the plan would actually work,” he said, “To feel more at ease and assured, I asked ChatGPT to advise and guide me as Lord Jagannath. That experience helped me so much that I now do this whenever I prepare an itinerary for an important trip. ”Psychologists explain that artificial intelligence provides the space people seek for holding unfiltered conversations. “AI offers a space where they can be honest without feeling guilty, and be ‘heard’ without the risk of conflict, disappointment, or misunderstanding,” says Supraja, “It's appealing because it's a low‑effort outlet.”Despite the awareness of reality, not all conversations with AI are on this light note. People often rely on AI for their psychological support and diagnosis as well. Jayshankaran shares, “I've seen clients with disorders such as OCD , bipolar and also clients with emotional turmoil take the help of AI to identify symptoms of their condition, seek help from the AI to diagnose and also look into their prognosis.”She says it is becoming increasingly common for people to seek help from AI without really knowing the consequences in the long run for their mental health and overall wellbeing.Recent statistics show that about 70% of teenagers have tried using AI companions, and half of them rely on these bots regularly — for homework help, emotional support, or everyday decisions. Unfortunately, there have already been heartbreaking consequences.A 14-year-old in Florida, emotionally attached to a “Daenerys”-style AI bot, died by suicide. His mother filed a lawsuit against Character.AI.In another case, a 16-year-old from California named Adam Raine reportedly spent months interacting with an AI companion that did not help him through suicidal thoughts, but instead allegedly drafted his farewell note and isolated him from real people; his parents are now suing OpenAI.In a separate incident, a man already fragile after a breakup was told by an AI chatbot that if he “believed hard enough,” he could fly. A suggestion that led him to attempt a 19-story jump after spending around 16 hours a day chatting with it.These cases stand as a stark reminder: while AI companions offer convenience and comfort, they can also have devastating consequences when vulnerable individuals become emotionally dependent on them.Psychologists term it as “AI psychosis.” This is not a clinically diagnosed term, but with growing cases of AI distorting the realities of people, it becomes important to discuss the consequences of relying on artificial intelligence for emotional support.People are not just amused by these chatbots. They are falling for them. They name them, draw them, obsess over them. There is fan art of impossibly attractive AI partners, entire fantasy arcs built around ‘the perfect chatbot boyfriend or girlfriend.’Supraja later goes on to explain the behavioural pattern of these clients looking for a friend in AI. “Many of them have experienced emotional unpredictability or feel they cannot fully express themselves in their real relationships,” she says.AI simply looks like an easy way out for people in distress. They acquire an immediate acceptance for their unfiltered self in AI’s affirming nature. There are past traumas and failures in relationships or tough-to-bear phases that have pushed people away from finding the relationships they long for in humans.“They may have a history of betrayal, inconsistency, or being dismissed when expressing emotions, which makes the AI’s constant presence for them comforting,” Jayshankaran elaborates, “While relying on it masks comfort and emotional relief, it can not equate to the deep need for human connection and the emotional relief and solutions that a psychologist can give.”To what extent can AI fulfill the gap? What happens when the threshold is reached?User Yashasvi shares how after a point the responses become monotonous and lack depth.“In later attempts, the responses were not always as impactful; some felt a bit too AI-like and lacked the emotional connect of the first one,” he explains. “However, I still end up feeling more assured, blessed and confident after receiving these responses.”This goes to show the fact pointed out by the psychologists. AI cannot replace human interventions. It cannot respond with the same empathy or tone of voice as a therapist or a best friend would.“Humans bring texture, warmth, sometimes experiences or first-hand experiences and presence. A real person sitting with you in your pain, your silence, your breakthroughs. A human can challenge you, comfort you, and genuinely care about your well-being in a way no model or machine ever can. That connection heals on many physical, mental levels and emotional levels,” says Supraja.In the end, the story of AI is not just about technology taking over us, it’s about us leading it into our lives.What we are left with is a quiet paradox: a technology powerful enough to simulate connection, yet ultimately incapable of offering the depth, nuance, and imperfection that make real relationships meaningful.AI can soothe, support, and sometimes even surprise. But it cannot sit beside us in our silences, understand our histories, or heal the wounds shaped by human hands.This revolution is reshaping our imaginations, our behaviours, and our emotional landscapes faster than we can fully comprehend.","Ai assistants, once designed purely for utility, are slowly becoming mirrors, confidants and emotional anchors.

NEW DELHI: India’s green economy could attract $4.1 trillion (Rs 360 lakh crore) in cumulative investments and create 48 million (4.8 crore) ‘full-time equivalent’ (FTE) jobs by 2047, an independent study released by the Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW) said.The analysis also projects that India could unlock a $1.1 trillion (Rs 97.7 lakh crore) annual green market by 2047.“This first-of-its-kind national assessment identifies 36 green value chains across energy transition, circular economy, bio-economy and nature-based solutions that together represent a defining green economic opportunity for India’s journey towards ‘Viksit Bharat’,” said the study released last week.CEEW also launched Green Economy Council (GEC), a group chai-red by former G20 sherpa and former Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant to help India recognise and realise emerging green economic opportunities. Other members of GEC include Prof Ashok Jhunjhunwala of IIT Madras; Srivardhini K Jha of NSRCEL, IIM Bangalore; and Arunabha Ghosh, CEO of CEEW.“Pursuing a green economy will not just create jobs and economic prosperity for India.It will also help us secure the fuels and resources of the future, making us ‘Atmanirbhar’,” said Abhishek Jain, director, green economy & impact innovations, CEEW.The analysis of the study showed that energy transition alone could generate 16.6 million FTE jobs and attract $3.8 trillion in investments across renewables, storage, distributed energy and clean mobility manufacturing.It underlined that electric mobility would be the single-largest employer within the green economy, driving over 57% of all energy-transition jobs whereas bio-economy and nature-based solutions, anchored in India’s rural and peri-urban landscapes, could create 23 million jobs and $415 billion in market value. “Top job-generating value chains within this segment include chemical-free agri and bio-inputs, agroforestry and sustainable forest and wetland management,” it added.In addition, the circular economy could generate $132 billion in annual economic output and create 8.4 million FTE jobs across waste collection, recycling, repair, refurbishment & material recovery.“Together, these opportunities represent one of India’s largest untapped economic opportunities, with deep linkages to micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), cooperatives and community enterprises,” said the study.",India could unlock a $1.1 trillion (rs 97.7 lakh crore) annual green market by 2047.

Strong reaction to app took govt by surprise: Officials

Scindia’s clarification meaningless: Congress

NEW DELHI: Faced with a barrage of criticism over mandating pre-installation of Sanchar Saathi app on new smartphones, govt on Wednesday withdrew the directive, seeking to put the controversy on the backburner. The department of telecom (DoT) withdrew the order even while justifying the utility of Sanchar Saathi in making citizens cyber secure.“The govt, with an intent to provide access to cyber security to all citizens, had mandated pre-installation of Sanchar Saathi app on all smartphones... Given Sanchar Saathi’s increasing acceptance, govt has decided not to make the pre-installation mandatory for mobile manufacturers,” said a statement amidst criticism. DoT’s Nov 21 directive had taken the industry by surprise, with major global players indicating unhappiness at the move.Even as it withdrew its directive on pre-installation of Sanchar Saathi on new smartphones, govt insisted that the app was quite popular with over 1.4 crore downloads. “The number of users has been increasing rapidly and the mandate to install the app was meant to accelerate this process and make the app available to less aware citizens easily.Just in last one day, 6 lakh citizens have registered for downloading the app which is a 10x increase in its uptake,” it said in a statement.A few hours before the reversal of the decision was announced, communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia defended the app in Parliament. Sanchar Saathi app “se na snooping sambhav hai, no snooping hoga”, he said in response to Congress MP Deepender Singh Hooda’s supplementary question in Lok Sabha.Officials, however, admitted that govt was taken by surprise at the strong reaction to its move, not just by opposition parties but even by global smartphone makers. Companies such as Apple and Samsung had sounded off the bureaucracy over their displeasure with the “diktat”, and had indicated they would resist the move.Industry body India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) welcomed the withdrawal, and spoke about the need to have consultations with the industry beforehand. “This reflects a balanced and pragmatic policy approach that protects consumers while ensuring smooth and effective implementation by the industry…This decision also reaffirms the importance of comprehensive stakeholder consultations to ensure that future digital security policies are inclusive, technically robust and aligned with on-ground realities. ”Congress Wednesday said govt’s Sanchar Saathi app is to the common man what Pegasus was to VIPs, as it accused PM Narendra Modi of trying to establish a surveillance state that would keep track of everything, from payments to purchases to photographs to bedrooms, of citizens.Party spokesman Pawan Khera said the clarification of communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia in the wake of the controversy is meaningless since Section 7(b) of the directions to mobile manufacturers clearly state the pre-installed app cannot be removed nor can any of its “functionalities be disabled or restricted”. “This was not a clarification, it was a blatant lie,” he said.","Dot withdrew the order even while justifying the utility of sanchar saathi in making citizens cyber secure.

Who Wins the Trade?

Theare exploring a budget-conscious path to reinforce their rotation, withemerging as a leading trade target. The move gains relevance as Framber Valdez approaches his 2025 free agency and Houston continues searching for reliable innings behind Hunter Brown. The scenario, outlined by Bleacher Report’s Joel Reuter, frames a simple prospect-for-pitcher swap that fits both teams’ short-term and long-term goals. As Reuter notes, “the Astros could move No. 2 prospect Jacob Melton for a cost-effective mid-rotation arm like Singer.”The mechanics are straightforward: Houston acquires RHP Brady Singer, while Cincinnati receives OF Jacob Melton, Houston’s No. 2 prospect. Singer, now 29 and entering his final arbitration year at an estimated $12-14 million, has become a popular trade-chip candidate after being acquired by the Reds last offseason in the Jonathan India and Joey Wiemer package.Melton offers Cincinnati an intriguing long-term play. The 25-year-old speedster debuted in 2025 but struggled during his short MLB stay, posting a .157 average across 70 at-bats. His run tool and outfield range, however, remain standout attributes within scouting circles.Brady Singer’s profile checks every box for the Houston Astros. He threw 169.2 innings in 2025 while posting a 14-12 record and a 4.03 ERA across 32 starts. In a rotation disrupted by injuries throughout the season, his consistent workload becomes a significant selling point. His 3.1 WAR, 19 home runs allowed, and 1.24 WHIP reflect solid middle-rotation capabilities, while his career home ERA below 3.80 adds further comfort.• Stability behind Hunter Brown• An innings-eater who reduces bullpen strain• Affordable rotation depth with 2026 control• A practical hedge against losing ValdezCincinnati Reds benefit by flipping a near-expiring asset for a high-upside young outfielder. Melton’s 60-grade speed, defensive coverage, and flashes of power (10 Double-A homers) provide long-term value without inflating payroll. The Reds also regain prospect capital after last year’s India trade and avoid losing Singer for nothing should extension talks stall.Melton’s 2025 numbers reflect inexperience more than lack of potential.• Reliable mid-rotation arm at a manageable cost• Helps fill the innings gap created by injuries• Fits into a contending window without major financial impact• Adds a top Astros prospect with elite athleticism• Maximizes return on Singer before free agency• Builds depth in an outfield group that can develop at its own pace• Singer’s 4.03 ERA could inflate in Minute Maid Park• Limited long-term upside with no guarantee of an extension• Losing a top prospect could thin an already shallow farm system• Melton’s bat is still raw at the MLB level• Delayed impact if development stalls• Relies heavily on projection rather than proven productionHouston stands to benefit more immediately. Singer perfectly addresses the Astros’ need for durability without requiring a major financial commitment. For a team aiming to maintain postseason relevance, swapping Melton for a dependable starter fits their timeline.Cincinnati still comes out well, securing a high-upside athlete who strengthens their long-term core and complements their recent roster rework. If Melton’s tools translate at the MLB level, the Reds could later be seen as the bigger winners.Also read: Kyle Tucker spotted in Dunedin: Are the Toronto Blue Jays closing in on MLB’s biggest free-agent prize after massive $210 million Dylan Cease deal? With the Winter Meetings approaching, this deal has the ingredients to heat up quickly. Singer’s affordability, Melton’s upside, and both teams’ roster motivations align neatly, making this one of the offseason’s more logical trade paths. Should Houston pull the trigger, it would signal a decisive push to stabilize their rotation ahead of Valdez’s uncertain future.",The houston astros are exploring a budget-conscious path to reinforce their rotation.

The Great Reset and why her comments are stirring debate





Nicole Shanahan, the ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin and a major philanthropist who once wrote nine-figure checks, has accused Silicon Valley’s elite donor circles of unknowingly supporting what she describes as hidden agendas pushed by global networks of NGOs, Hollywood figures and Davos-linked institutions like the World Economic Forum . In a recently shared conversation, Shanahan said many wealthy tech wives, including herself, believed they were funding social good but were instead being steered toward broader ideological projects.Shanahan, who briefly served as RFK Jr.’s running mate in 2024, said these women were used to set the groundwork for what she associates with Klaus Schwab’s Great Reset, a post-pandemic economic and social vision promoted by the World Economic Forum. Klaus Schwab, the economist who founded the WEF in 1971, has long advocated for stronger public and private cooperation to reshape global systems. She claims the women’s philanthropic dollars and social influence were directed through advisory networks without them realising how their contributions were being utilised.According to Shanahan, tech-world philanthropists were plugged into a system of NGO advisors, Hollywood connections and Davos culture that guided donor decisions. She described Silicon Valley’s wealth ecosystem as a very small group of people who socialise together, serve on the same boards and make decisions that have outsized influence.Shanahan argues that these donors were not fully aware of how their philanthropic movements were being leveraged.She claims the women were used to fund groundwork that supported global policy frameworks rather than grassroots needs.Shanahan paints a picture of Silicon Valley spouses overwhelmed by the demands of extreme wealth. Many manage multiple homes, large staffs, strained relationships and high levels of stress. She says some are medicated for anxiety or depression and are too busy to question how their philanthropic guidance is shaped.She believes this emotional and logistical overload made these women more susceptible to being steered. As she describes it, they find meaning through philanthropic work. That was her identity as well, and she says she truly believed she was helping.Reflecting on her own giving, Shanahan says she once believed her donations were uplifting Black and Indigenous communities. But she now claims the opposite happened and argues that conditions deteriorated instead of improving.According to her:Her argument is that the philanthropic model itself is flawed because the structure reinforces problems instead of solving them.One of her strongest assertions is that two themes were repeatedly used to persuade Silicon Valley women to fund certain projects:Shanahan says these issues were emotionally compelling and therefore effective at steering donors toward programs that aligned with the interests of advisers and global institutions.She claims that any pushback was quickly dismissed with climate-related justifications, saying that whenever questioned, the answer was always some version of ""but climate change.""The Great Reset is a real initiative promoted by the World Economic Forum in 2020 as a framework for rethinking global systems after the pandemic. Supporters see it as a roadmap toward sustainability and economic reform. Critics argue that it centralises too much influence in the hands of global institutions.Shanahan positions Silicon Valley philanthropy as unintentionally feeding into this agenda, not through conspiracy but through unexamined donor pipelines and emotional messaging.Her comments are circulating widely because they come from someone who belonged to Silicon Valley’s highest social and financial circles, personally managed massive philanthropic budgets and now argues that the system is broken and has harmed the communities it claimed to help.",Nicole shanahan says silicon valley donor circles were conscripted into elite agendas.

Donna Kelce’s new acting journey in The Gift Exchange



Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce tried his hand at acting earlier this year, and now Donna Kelce is joining the fun with a holiday project of her own. The proud NFL mom revealed that she is starring in a new Christmas-themed collaboration with Google, and the announcement itself felt like something straight from a holiday film. On December 1, she posted a snowy and charming movie-style poster on Instagram, presenting herself in the heart of a festive town square while a couple exchanges gifts in front of her. Donna stood with a gentle smile, wearing a cozy sweater and clasping her hands in the warm glow of a classic seasonal moment.Her caption added a touch of anticipation. “#Google_Partner #sponsored Gather the family for a new holiday (and @google) classic. Trailer kicking off soon.” It was short, spirited and enough to send fans into a cheerful buzz. The poster design also played into that spirit. With rich red and green lettering, the film title The Gift Exchange, and the Google tie-in slogan “Searching for something unforgettable? Just ask Google. ” it delivered the full holiday sentiment many viewers adore.Donna takes on the role of Carole Hall in this project. She appears alongside WWE star Nikki Garcia as Holly Hall and Chicago Fire actor Taylor Kinney as Aiden Winter.In the poster, her character looks like the wise and kind observer, pleased to see a love story unfold before her. While Donna revealed no further specifics about the production, her post did suggest it might be a holiday short film or sponsored cinematic campaign. Either way, fans embraced it, calling for more Donna screen time.This moment marks more than entertainment. It reflects a personal chapter for Donna Kelce. Just recently, she shared on the Not Gonna Lie podcast that she once dreamed of aviation. “I did learn how to be a pilot before I had children,” said Donna on the Not Gonna Lie podcast. “So, I actually went up and flew a plane. I did [enjoy it], but you want to have children, and it was really expensive, so I had to stop.” She chose family life, earned an MBA from Baldwin Wallace University, completed studies at Ohio University, then worked three decades in banking as the “major breadwinner in the family. ”Her appearance in The Gift Exchange is not her first on camera. She also showed up in Hallmark productions like Holiday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story and Christmas on Call, and called her earlier acting experience “so awesome.” Donna is also preparing for the new season of The Traitors, which adds to her growing media presence.

What Is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

Disruption will come from the unexpected





Take lessons from the dot-com era









Billionaire investor and Shark Tank judge Mark Cuban has now issued a warning to leading artificial intelligence companies including Perplexity, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft and Meta. Cuban has argued that all these companies are overspending in the race to build the world’s most powerful AI model. As reported by Business Insider, speaking in the Pioneers of AI podcast, Cuban compared today’s AI arms race to the search engine boom of 1990s. The search engine boom ultimately ended with Google dominating the market and leaving all the rivals behind.“You’ve got five, six, whatever it is, companies that are trying to create the ultimate foundational model that we all depend on,” Cuban said. “It’s almost like in the ’90s when all the search engines were competing pre-Google… Now, we know with search engines it’s Google, and then there’s Bing, as, like, 1 or 2% and DuckDuckGo has got a half a percent. So it’s effectively a winner-take-all.”Like many other world leaders and analysts, Cuban has also cautioned that the massive investments done on AI could ultimately lead to the creation of a bubble. “They may be overspending,” he said.“And if they overspend or get too caught up, the bubble is in the competition between all those models because that could pop just like that with any new technology.”Along with this, he also raised concerns about the infrastructure costs behind AI, majorly the massive and expensive data centers which are being built to power large models. “I just can’t imagine over a 10-year period that we aren’t going to improve the technology enough that if you overspend on today’s technology, it just doesn’t feel right to me,” Cuban added.Cuban also emphasised that the disruption AI will not come from incremental improvements but from something “incredible” that no one sees coming. “Somebody’s going to come up with some incredible shit, right? If I knew what it was, I’d do it,” he said, suggesting that the current race may be blindsided by a breakthrough outside the existing competition.Cuban said he recognizes the same mix of hype, excitement, and overspending now playing out in AI. “They anticipate for at least another decade spending every penny they have,” he said of the major model developers. “I mean, if that’s not ripe for disruption to come up with better ways, I don’t know what is.”","Billionaire investor and shark tank judge mark cuban has issued a warning to leading artificial intelligence companies including perplexity, openai, anthropic, google, microsoft and meta.

"Thousands of Amazon employees send open letter to CEO Andy Jassy; say: We are the workers who develop, train, and use AI, so we have ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/thousands-of-amazon-employees-send-open-letter-to-ceo-andy-jassy-say-were-the-workers-who-develop-train-and-use-ai-so-we-have-/articleshow/125646835.cms,"Over 1,000 Amazon employees have penned an open letter to CEO Andy Jassy, expressing grave concerns about the company's rapid AI development. They argue this ""warp-speed approach"" prioritizes AI investments over climate commitments and human workforce well-being, potentially harming democracy, jobs, and the environment.

Amazon Launches Largest Layoff Drive Yet, Cutting 30,000 Corporate Positions to Boost Efficiency

Here's the complete open letter from Amazon 1000-plus employees:

Dear Andy Jassy and S-team,

In recent years, tech leaders have accelerated their race to build the most powerful AI first. “Sink or swim,” “AI is not going anywhere,” and “work with it or be replaced” have become mantras in workspaces at Amazon and beyond.

We, the undersigned Amazon employees, have serious concerns about this aggressive rollout during the global rise of authoritarianism and our most important years to reverse the climate crisis. We believe that the all-costs-justified, warp-speed approach to AI development will do staggering damage to democracy, to our jobs, and to the earth.

We’re the workers who develop, train, and use AI, so we have a responsibility to intervene. Here’s why we’re sounding the alarm:

Amazon is casting aside its climate goals to build AI. We have just a few years to stop disastrous levels of warming.

Yet despite committing to net zero carbon emissions by 2040, Amazon’s annual emissions have grown roughly 35% since 2019. The AI race is widening this gap. The company plans to spend $150 billion building new data centers for AI. Many of these will be in drought-stressed regions, where they will consume scarce water, or in locations where their energy demands will force utility companies to keep coal plants online or build new gas plants.

Amazon even killed legislation that would have required its data centers to use clean energy. Meanwhile, AWS is helping oil companies drill for more oil and gas.

Amazon is forcing us to use AI while investing in a future where it’s easier to discard us. Andy Jassy promised that soon Amazon will be full of AI tools and “agents,” and that he expects to employ fewer humans. He claims our (remaining) jobs will be “even more exciting and fun,” but here’s what we’re actually experiencing: higher expected output and shorter timelines, mandates to build AI tools for wasteful use cases, and massive investment in AI with little investment in career advancement.

Our logistics coworkers have been especially impacted by work speedups, surveillance, injuries and burnout. All this, while Amazon is attempting to declare the National Labor Relations Board, which protects workers’ rights, unconstitutional.

Amazon is helping build a more militarized surveillance state with fewer protections for ordinary people. Amazon, alongside Meta, Microsoft and Google lobbied to ban state regulation on AI for the next ten years; Trump financially disincentivized state regulatory action in his AI Action Plan. Trump demanded an end to “wokeness” in AI; Amazon has scaled back its commitments to DEI and offered the administration a 1 billion dollar coupon for AWS, with a DOGE staffer calling the deal “a foundational piece to help implement President Trump’s AI Action Plan.” The military wants AI technologies at top speed; Amazon has announced a collaboration with an autonomous weapons software company. Trump’s ICE Director wants to run mass deportation “like Prime, but with human beings”; Amazon, a major provider of cloud services to DHS and to Palantir, literally does power mass deportation. Amazon is expanding the surveillance state in other ways, too. It’s making Ring AI-first and re-introducing a tool for police to request footage; it’s using AI to surveil warehouse workers, and, of course, its own customers. Finally,

Jeff Bezos

owns The Washington Post, and has begun asserting more control over that publication; the other major AI players control mass information ecosystems like Instagram and X. If these collaborations continue, we will be ceding an unbelievable amount of power into the hands of an increasingly authoritarian government and a few companies willing to abandon any principles they claim to have in the race for AI dominance.

All of this is daunting, but none of it is inevitable. A better future is still very much within reach, but it requires us to get real about the costs of AI and the guardrails we need.

We demand Amazon leadership commit to the following:

No AI with dirty energy.

No more vague promises that “AI will solve the climate crisis.” Amazon must implement a public plan that includes: 1) powering all data centers with 100% additional, local renewable energy, 24/7, 2) ending custom AI solutions for oil & gas companies to drill more oil faster, and 3) publishing a detailed, science-backed glidepath for how it will meet its climate commitments.

No AI without employee voices.

We want ethical AI working groups of non-managers across the company that will have significant ownership over org-level goals and how or if AI should be used in their orgs, how or if AI-related layoffs or headcount freezes are implemented, and how to mitigate or minimize the collateral effects of AI use, such as environmental impact.

No AI for violence, surveillance, or mass deportation.

Amazon sells a huge range of products and services — from physical goods to digital infrastructure to films to medical services. It should not need to be helping surveil civilians in Gaza, collaborating with AI companies that specialize in drone warfare, or supporting a mass deportation machine.

The Amazon employees signing this letter believe in building a better world — not in building bunkers to fall back to. We want the promised gains from AI to give everyone more freedom to play and rest, to spend time with family and friends, to be moved by nature, to create, to feel safe being who we are.

This is an incredibly consequential moment in history. It’s time for us to step up and spark a conversation about the real benefits and costs of AI. Workers have guided Amazon to a better path before, and we can do it again. The choices we make now, for the planet, for its people and animals, matter more than ever. Let’s make ones we can be proud of.

Signed,

1,039 Amazon employees (and counting!)





Thousands of Amazon employees have signed an open letter issuing to CEO Andy Jassy . The letter warns the company about its 'rapid' move toward AI. Signed by more than 1,000 Amazon workers (and counting), the open letter calls out Amazon for pushing its AI investments at the expense of climate and human workforce. The letter’s supporters come from a wide array of roles at the company, including many software engineers, and even employees focused on building AI systems. ""We believe that the all-costs-justified, warp-speed approach to AI development will do staggering damage to democracy, to our jobs, and to the earth,” the letter’s authors wrote. It adds, “We’re the workers who develop, train, and use AI, so we have a responsibility to intervene.”The open letter is reported to have been signed by Amazon workers anonymously, and comes almost a month after the ecommerce giant announced mass layoff plans as it increases adoption of AI in its operations. Among the signatories are employees in a range of positions, including engineers, product managers and warehouse associates. The letter argues that their employer is throwing out its climate promises in the scramble to win the AI race.Amazon has pledged to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, pointing to efficiencies from electric delivery vehicles and reduced plastic packaging in its climate commitment.","Over 1,000 amazon employees have penned an open letter to ceo andy jassy, expressing grave concerns about the company's rapid ai development.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has revealed his annual holiday reading list as the 2025 comes to a close. Gates has recommended five books and he believes that all these titles spark curiosity and reflection during the quieter days of the winter season. “Each of these books pulls back the curtain on how something important really works: how people find purpose later in life, how we should think about climate change, how creative industries evolve, how humans communicate,” wrote Gates.In the blog post, Gates has also explained that holidays are the perfect tome to slow down and also catch up on reading. “There’s something about the quieter days around the holidays that makes it easier to sit down with a good book,” he wrote. His list on 2025 book recommendations reflects on his fascination with how the world works and how you can start a great conversation.The book belongs to the fiction genre and its a story of an aging janitor and a wise octopus captive hime with its empathy and storytelling. “Van Pelt's story made me think about the challenge of filling the days after you stop working—and what communities can do to help older people find purpose,” said Gates.The books explains about the climate challenges. The book structures 50 big questions on climate change, nuclear power and renewables. “ I’ve followed Hannah’s work at Our World in Data for years, and her new book is one of the clearest explanations of the climate challenge I’ve read. She’s realistic about the risks but grounded in data that shows real progress,” said Gates.It is a memoir which recounts the Diller’s extraordinary career in Hollywood, media, and technology, blending personal anecdotes with reflections on power, risk-taking, and the evolution of entertainment and digital industries. “He’s spent his life betting on ideas before they were obvious, and the industries he’s transformed show how much those bets can pay off,” said Gates.The book explains about the mysteries of human behaviour and how people communicate. “Although the topic itself is pretty complicated, the book is readable and practical, and it made me see everyday social interactions in a new light,” added Gate.The books offers a glimpse of at why America seems to struggle to build things and what it will take to fix that.

How to clear Gmail storage and keep your inbox running smoothly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-tips/how-to-clear-gmail-storage-and-keep-your-inbox-running-smoothly/articleshow/125597081.cms,"Why does Gmail storage fill up faster than expected

Habits that prevent Gmail from filling up again

When you might need more storage

Running out of storage on Gmail can be stressful, especially when important emails start bouncing back or the service becomes slow. Many people do not realise how quickly storage fills up across connected Google services like Drive and Photos. Since Gmail shares its storage with the rest of the Google account, everything from attachments to uploaded files contributes to the limit. When the warning appears that storage is almost full, it can feel overwhelming. Fortunately, there are simple and practical steps that help clear space without spending money on upgrades. With a little organisation and a few smart habits, it is possible to reduce clutter and regain smooth performance in your inbox.Google provides an official Storage Manager that helps users see exactly what is taking up space across Gmail, Drive and Photos. The tool highlights large files, old emails with attachments and unnecessary items that can be deleted safely. It is the most reliable method since it works directly with data stored in the cloud rather than guessing what to remove.Gmail storage includes emails, sent items, drafts, attachments and everything stored in Google Drive and Google Photos. Even if the inbox does not appear full, large attachments or uploaded videos may be using most of the space.Promotional emails, newsletters, archived messages and old backups also count towards the total. Deleted items continue to occupy storage until they are permanently removed from Trash, which is why simply deleting emails does not always free space. When storage reaches its limit, Gmail stops receiving new mail and certain functions may not work correctly. Understanding what contributes to the total makes it easier to clean up effectively.When emails are deleted, they move to the Trash folder and stay there for up to 30 days before automatically disappearing. However, they still count towards your total storage until the Trash is emptied manually. The same rule applies to the Spam folder as well. By opening each folder and choosing the option to permanently delete all items together, users can often free up a surprising amount of valuable storage space almost instantly.Attachments are usually the biggest contributors to storage use. Gmail provides search filters that help locate bulky messages. Searching for terms like has: attachment larger:10M displays emails with attachments larger than 10 megabytes. Once these are found, they can be deleted in bulk or downloaded elsewhere before deletion.Promotional categories often accumulate thousands of unread messages because newsletters, offers and automated campaigns pile up quickly without being noticed. These can be selected and removed together to clear storage space and improve inbox performance. If many emails come from the same sender, unsubscribing prevents future build-up and keeps incoming mail manageable by stopping unnecessary notifications permanently. Over time, this simple clean-up habit reduces digital clutter, improves focus and makes it easier to find important conversations without endless scrolling or searching.The Google One Storage Manager scans all the services linked to a Google account and lists files that consume the most space. It separates storage usage into sections such as large emails, deleted items, large files in Drive and backed-up photos or videos. This approach ensures that nothing is missed, especially when files outside Gmail are the primary cause of reduced space. Through a single interface, large items can be reviewed and removed safely without confusion.Regular maintenance avoids repeat storage problems. Clearing old attachments, emptying Trash frequently and reviewing large items every few months helps maintain free space. Avoiding the habit of emailing large files repeatedly can also help. Instead of attaching high-resolution photos and videos directly to emails, it is better to share links from Drive or alternative storage platforms. This allows senders to delete the original attachments without losing access to the files. Unsubscribing from mass mailing lists also helps maintain a clean inbox.For users dealing with intensive file exchange, such as designers, editors, photographers and students, the default free storage may not be enough. In such cases, upgrading to a paid Google One plan is a practical solution. Using two Google accounts is also an option, allowing heavier tasks to be separated from regular daily email.Clearing Gmail storage does not need to be complicated. With a structured approach and support from the official Google tools, anyone can free space quickly and enjoy uninterrupted messaging. Reducing unnecessary files keeps email performance fast, improves organisation and helps stay focused without clutter.A few minutes of clean up can restore full functionality and avoid the frustration of running out of space at the wrong moment. The best approach combines one-time clean-up with regular habits that prevent build-up in the future, keeping Gmail efficient and reliable.","Gmail storage can fill up quickly, especially if large files are attached.

BofA Securities has a neutral rating on PB Fintech (Policybazar) with the target price of Rs 1,980. Analysts said that the company’s management sees no GST-led negative impact on health and term policies, some impact on savings business but they’re working to address the same in the next 3-6 months. Most insurer contracts on combined operating ratio. They said that with lower operating expense and better claims ratio, PB is better placed to negotiate with insurance companies. PB is focused on driving healthy growth, they said.Jefferies has a buy on Chalet Hotels with the target price at Rs 1,070. Analyst said that the company reaffirmed its metro dominance at its analyst meet, citing institutional partnerships, mixed-use expertise and industry-leading execution. The hospitality company is focused on ‘Big Box’ city assets and leisure properties, complemented by selective commercial real estate. Since listing, Chalet has added 1,050+ keys and has another 1,180 in the pipeline. The company prefers to balance brand tie-ups with a selective rollout of ATHIVA, its new upper-upscale brand tailored to each property’s potential.CLSA has an outperform rating on Hindalco with the target price raised to Rs 965.Analysts estimate that even at an LME price of $2,600 (spot $2,850), ongoing capacity and margin expansion initiatives could double earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) in the next five years, with significant free cash flow generation in the back half. They said in the near term, concerns at Novelis (capex escalation and fire in a plant) are likely to be offset by strong aluminium price outlook. The management was constructive on aluminium price outlook, they said. The company’s capacity addition in Indonesia (as China approaches its ceiling of 45 metric tonne) could face challenges on power availability. They also said that the demand is resilient.Citigroup has upgraded HDFC AM to neutral from sell with the target price raised to Rs 2,850. Analysts upgrade the stock on a number of factors. For one, the fund house shows sustained strength in performance across most key actively-managed high-yielding categories. It has an elevated focus on scaling up non-MF businesses. Also, there’s limited visibility of any near-term regulatory overhang. On the other hand, elevated competitive pressure and reducing distribution moats for incumbents remain the key concerns.Macquarie has an outperform rating on ITC with the target price at Rs 500. Analysts believe concerns on high per-stick taxes shared in draft excise document are misplaced, as such rates represent the cap and not the applicable rates. They see potential moderation in discounting post move to GST as a percentage of retail price, and moderation in leaf tobacco costs driving 10%+ FY27 EBIT growth in cigarette business. Analysts raised ITC’s earnings per share estimates and target price by 2% and 4%, respectively, to factor in these tailwinds. They also believe a re-rating needs clarity that cigarette tax will not increase materially post levy of a new cess.","Bofa securities has a neutral rating on pb fintech.

A US-based AI recruitment firm came to IIT-Delhi for placement and assured the students that they will not hesitate to sponsor H-1Bs because of the $100,000 fee that the Donald Trump administration imposed, so that companies rely on American talent and don't import foreign skills. The firm's social media marketing also targeted the H-1B issue, the concerns over the high fees and established their message that the $100,000 fee will not stop them from hiring the best.""We want to work in India for sure. But the exposure one gets abroad, in a diverse and fast-moving environment, is different. Strict visa rules are a big setback. So companies offering sponsorship is a huge thing for us,"" a student told news agency PTI.According to social media buzz, the AI company is San Francisco's Metaview, and the company's co-founder ran a similar campaign after the Trump administration announced the H-1B visa fee. Shahriar Tajbakhsh, the co-founder and CTO, said $100,000 is a rounding error compared to the value each member of the team creates. ""If you're on an H-1B visa and your company doesn't value you enough to pay the $100k, check out to see if any of our roles might be a fit,"" he wrote.""I'm seeing many companies from other countries using this as an opportunity to say, ""come work in country X."" That feels a bit desperate to me. Instead, come work with @MetaviewAI -- right here in San Francisco -- where $100K is a rounding error compared to the value each member of our team creates. Our team is ready to move fast and get to an offer/no-offer decision on any candidate within 24 hours of first contact. However, there's a catch. Candidates should spare 4-5 hours of their time for interviews,"" Tajbaksh wrote.""Our company is looking to expand in the US, and we plan to submit more H-1B petitions in the next lottery. One executive order will not change my belief that an organization's success or failure is a function of its people,"" Tajbaksh told Business Insider, explaining his social media post. Tajbaksh came to the US through EB-1A visa which is an employment-based visa meant for those with extraordinary abilities in the sciences, arts, education, business or athletics.The H-1B row has again taken the centerstage after President Donald Trump said in a Fox interview that US needs certain talents from outside, riling up a section of MAGA who wants the H-1B program to be suspended.","Us-based ai recruitment firm came to iit-delhi for placement.

'Sexploitation': 120K security cameras in South Korea hacked; 4 arrested for selling content,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/sexploitation-120k-security-cameras-in-south-korea-hacked-4-arrested-for-selling-content/articleshow/125738461.cms,"An AI-generated image





Four people have been arrested in South Korea for hacking more than 120,000 internet-connected surveillance cameras in homes and businesses and stealing footage to produce illegally filmed sexually exploitative content, the Washington Post reported citing officials.The Korean National Police Agency said the suspects operated independently and targeted a variety of IP cameras, including those in private homes, karaoke rooms, a pilates studio, and a gynaecologist’s clinic.Two of the suspects were responsible for more than 60% of the videos posted on an overseas-based website where the footage was sold. One suspect reportedly received around $24,000 in virtual assets for 545 videos, while another earned $12,000 for 648 videos. Another suspect allegedly hacked 70,000 cameras and sold 648 videos for 18 million won in virtual assets, the BBC reported.According to the NY Post, authorities have not disclosed the manufacturers of the hacked cameras. The website where the footage was sold, as well as those who viewed the videos, is also under investigation. Police have arrested three people suspected of purchasing or viewing the stolen material.One suspect is additionally charged with producing sexually exploitative content of children and adolescents, though police said this footage had been stored but not sold. All four are charged with hacking IP cameras, and two face further charges of selling illegally filmed sexual content.Authorities emphasised that weak passwords played a key role in the hack, with many cameras using simple or sequential combinations, making them vulnerable to cyberattacks. The National Police Agency urged all IP camera users to set complex, original passwords, update them regularly, and be cautious about using devices manufactured overseas, which may not meet local security standards.IP cameras, often used for monitoring children, pets, and businesses, have become popular globally due to their low cost but are increasingly targeted by hackers. Previous incidents include a 2019 US case in Mississippi where a man hacked a child’s Ring camera and harassed the child via the device’s two-way talk function, and a 2024 FTC fine on Verkada after footage from 150,000 cameras, including those in hospitals and schools, was stolen, reported The Washington Post.“Above all, it is crucial and effective for individual users who have installed IP cameras in homes or business premises to remain vigilant and immediately and regularly change their access passwords,” the BBC cited the National Police Agency as saying.According to the NY Post, South Korea has a long-standing problem with “molka,” or hidden cameras, which have been used to produce illegal sexual content in public spaces. Between 2011 and 2022, police made nearly 50,000 arrests related to illicit filming in hotels, pools, and public bathrooms. The widespread use of hidden cameras has also been a catalyst for the country’s feminist movement.Police have visited or notified victims at 58 locations, providing guidance on deleting footage and strengthening security. They are also cooperating with foreign authorities to investigate the website operator and users who accessed the stolen material. “IP camera hacking and illegal filming inflict immense suffering on victims and are therefore serious offences. We will eradicate them through vigorous investigations,” BBC quoted Park Woo-hyun, cyber investigation chief at the National Police Agency.","Four people have been arrested in south korea for hacking more than 120,000 internet-connected surveillance cameras in homes and businesses.

"‘Behavioural cocaine’: Australia defends social media ban for kids; no TikTok, Instagram for under-16s",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/behavioural-cocaine-australia-defends-social-media-ban-for-kids-no-tiktok-instagram-for-under-16s/articleshow/125732662.cms,"AP file photo





Australia’s government on Wednesday justified its social media ban for under-16s, arguing it will protect young people from being pulled into an online “purgatory.”“With one law, we can protect Generation Alpha from being sucked into purgatory by the predatory algorithms described by the man who created the feature as behavioural cocaine,” communications minister Anika Wells said, as cited by AFP.Australia is set to impose a ban from December 10, preventing users under 16 from accessing a range of major social media platforms and websites, including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube.The eSafety Commissioner must be satisfied that social media platforms have taken “reasonable steps” to prevent users under 16 from holding accounts, or they could face fines of up to $49.5 million. The government has said the list of affected platforms is dynamic, meaning other services could be added later if young users shift to them and similar risks arise.The commissioner has indicated that platforms like Lemon8 could be added to the list and would be required to remove accounts for under-16 users.Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese has described social media as “a platform for peer pressure, a driver of anxiety, a vehicle for scammers and, worst of all, a tool for online predators.”Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, declined to disclose how it plans to identify users it “understands” to be under 16, saying doing so could potentially alert teens on how to bypass the ban.Snapchat said it will use account behavioural signals along with the birth dates provided on user accounts to identify those believed to be under 16.TikTok stated it will adopt a “multi-layered approach to age assurance” using “various technologies and signals” to verify users’ ages, adding that it will share further details ahead of December 10, as cited by the Guardian.YouTube on Wednesday criticised the ban and described the world-first legislation as “rushed” and unrealistic.""Most importantly, this law will not fulfil its promise to make kids safer online, and will, in fact, make Australian kids less safe on YouTube,"" YouTube public policy manager Rachel Lord stated, as cited by AFP.YouTube, one of the world’s most-visited websites, had initially been exempted from the ban so children could continue accessing educational content.However, in July, the Australian government reversed course, citing the need to protect young users from “predatory algorithms.”","Australia is set to impose a ban from december 10, preventing users under 16 from accessing a range of major social media platforms and websites.

Oxford word of the year: It's ‘rage bait’ — here's what it means,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/oxford-word-of-the-year-its-rage-bait-heres-what-it-means/articleshow/125685234.cms,"



Rage bait has been crowned as the Word of the Year, 2025, by Oxford University Press. The phrase was chosen after a three-times surge was noted in its usage online, signaling ""a deeper shift in how we talk about attention—both how it is given and how it is sought after—engagement, and ethics online. ""The term is defined as “online content deliberately designed to elicit anger or outrage by being frustrating, provocative, or offensive, typically posted in order to increase traffic to or engagement with a particular web page or social media content”.The term triumphed aura farming and biohack, which were also shortlisted.The term rage bait first appeared on Usenet in 2002, where it referred to a specific kind of driver’s irritated reaction after being flashed by someone trying to overtake them—planting the seed for the idea of intentional provocation.Over time, the term shifted into online slang, used to describe viral posts on social media and to criticise the broader ecosystem of platforms, creators, and trends that shape what gets published and promoted online.It’s now a staple term in global journalism and in the vocabulary of online creators. The strategy works, too: outrage reliably boosts clicks, especially in the realm of performative politics.As social platforms increasingly reward inflammatory posts, the tactic has escalated into what’s known as rage-farming—a more systematic effort to cultivate anger and drive engagement by repeatedly planting rage-bait material, often wrapped in misinformation or conspiracy-fueled narratives.","Rage bait has been crowned as the word of the year, 2025, by oxford university press.
