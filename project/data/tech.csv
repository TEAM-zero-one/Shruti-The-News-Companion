Apple founder Steve Jobs lived by the rule that God is in details



In a proof of power of a single image and the story behind the iconic portrait of Apple co-founder Setev Jobs highlights that how a competent photographer won over the famously camera-shy Jobs. In the year 2006, a Scottish photographer Albert Watson was given the task of capturing a portrait of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs for a magazine. Jobs was known for his camera-shy personality and he also disliked photo sessions. However, the portrait captured by Watson later became iconic and Jobs himself described it as ‘maybe the best picture ever taken of me.’ As reported by Bezinga, commissioned for a magazine feature, was scheduled for 9 a.m. sharp. Jobs arrived at 8:59 a.m., punctual and businesslike. Watson was warned in advance that ‘Jobs hated photographers’. When Watson met Jobs he said, ‘I believe I have you for an hour, but I think I can get this done in half an hour.” Jobs, visibly relieved, replied, “Oh, my god, that would be great. I’ve got so much to do today.”In order to capture the perfect photograph, Watson approached the shoot with minimalist precision. He used a white background, clean lighting and selected passport-style composition. Watson also instructed Jobs to lean a bit forward, imagining himself to be sitting across a table with someone who disagrees with him, but knowing that he was right. Jobs responded with characteristic wit: “Easy for me, I do that every day.”The photo session lasted for about 20 minutes and after seeing the Polaroid, Jobs reportedly said “That’s maybe the best picture ever taken of me.”Years after capturing the perfect portrait of Steve Jobs, Watson received a call from California requesting the photo again. On the same evening he got to know that Jobs has passed away on October 5, 2011 after this battle with pancreatic cancer. Apple then used the same portrait to pay tribute on its homepage. Since then the portrait has become a visual symbol of Jobs’ legacy.Apple founder Steve Jobs believed and lived by a simple rule which clearly defines his successful career, “God is in the details."" As per biographer Walter Isaacon, Jobs spent ‘hours after hours’ obsessing over the smallest of design elements, driven by a belief that ‘God is in the details’. It is believed that this philosophy of Jobs has shaped Apple’s DNA and it still continues to be the culture at the company.",A scottish photographer albert watson was given the task of capturing a portrait of apple co-founder steve jobs for a magazine.

""Quant finance offers a pretty rare combination: the complexity and intellectual challenge that AI research also provides, but with a much faster pace,"" he explained to Business Insider.At Citadel Securities, Quazi expects to see measurable impact in days rather than the months or years typical in research environments.

This initiative is part of a larger effort to drive innovation, facilitate market entry, and link Indian entrepreneurs with Sharjah’s rapidly growing entrepreneurial ecosystem.The MoU was formally signed on August 25, 2025, at Sheraa’s headquarters in Sharjah. The signatories were Sara Abdulaziz Al Nuaimi, CEO of Sheraa, and Siby Sudhakaran, CEO of Startup Middle East. The signing was attended by Anoop Ambika, CEO of Kerala Startup Mission, along with various officials and representatives from Indian startup companies.The agreement outlines a collaborative roadmap to enhance bilateral startup ties, and prominently includes the launch of the Sharjah Centre of India Startup Hub (ISH), a dedicated platform designed to give Indian entrepreneurs direct access to Sharjah’s innovation resources and opportunities.This center will serve as a bridge connecting Indian startups with Sharjah’s entrepreneurial infrastructure, including its five free zones, the Sharjah Chamber of Commerce, and IBPC Sharjah.

He is separately suing the company and its CEO Sam Altman in California, seeking to challenge its transition from a nonprofit—founded with his backing in 2015—to a for-profit model.Apple’s App Store policies have long drawn scrutiny.

"Movement signatures: How we move, gesture, use facial expressions is unique; could be as different as fingerprint",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/movement-signatures-how-we-move-gesture-use-facial-expressions-could-be-as-unique-as-fingerprint/articleshow/123483187.cms,"



MANCHESTER: The way someone walks, talks, smiles, or gestures gives a clue to who they are. Whether through the flick of an eyebrow, the rhythm of our walk, or the tilt of a head, movement speaks volumes.And my recent paper shows that people may have their own movement fingerprint. This is a style of movement that is characteristic of a person's identity. So, someone who uses expressive facial gestures might also speak with animated hand movements or walk with a lively gait. These consistencies could form a motion fingerprint that is unique to the individual.First, let's explore how faces move and why this matters.Everyone has their own style of moving their face, for example, how they raise an eyebrow, purse their lips, or squint when laughing. These patterns of movement help us recognise familiar people even when the visual quality is poor, such as in low lighting or from a distance. And as a person becomes more familiar to us, we become tuned to the way they move, learning their unique patterns of motion, just like we remember their face or voice.Human faces are constantly in motion; they blink, smile, grimace and talk, to name a few movements. Researchers categorise facial motion into rigid movements (such as turning or nodding the head) and non-rigid movements (like expressing emotion or speaking). It's the non-rigid movements that tend to be most personally distinctive.The way we gesture with our hands, shift our posture and tilt our heads all carry identity information. Gestures are often shaped by personal habits or cultural norms; for example, someone might habitually nod three times when agreeing, or use a distinctive hand wave common in their home country.Facial movements are synchronised with the way we sound. When we talk, our face plays a role in shaping the sound of our voice. For example, if you talk with a wide open mouth, your speech sounds deeper and richer. Studies show that people can match other people's voices to moving faces more accurately than to static ones. This suggests that dynamic cues to identity are present in the movement of the face and the sound of the voice.People with face recognition difficulties (those who are ""face blind"" or prosopagnosic) may be better at recognising moving faces than still ones. Typically, people who are face blind can see faces and the differences between them, but struggle to link the face to a specific person. Here, idiosyncratic information from movement can provide an additional clue to identity.Gait, a person's walking style, is one of the most studied body movements. Early research, such as a 2005 study, investigated participants' recognition of identity from gait using point-light displays. In this case, bright spots (lights) were placed on key areas of a person's body. All other visual cues were removed. Participants could only see bright spots against a dark background. The study found participants could tell fairly well who someone was from the way the spots moved.Characteristics such as stride length, limb movement, posture and pace form a consistent motion pattern that is unique and surprisingly difficult to fake, making gait analysis a reliable clue for identifying people.Movement fingerprintsMy review brought together evidence from behavioural and brain imaging studies to consider if such consistencies between different types of motion exist and how we might explore this phenomenon further. The paper proposes that people have an overall style of movement.More work needs to be done to find direct evidence of movement fingerprints. For example, we still aren't sure what part of the brain processes these movement-based identity cues.So far, research shows that the posterior temporal sulcus - an area of the brain located roughly above your ear on each side - responds not just to faces and bodies, but to how someone moves more generally. This area is active when we hear voices or see people speak, suggesting it may help link motion and sound. Also, this region plays a key role in allowing us to understand our social world, interpreting other people's actions, determining where they are looking, and picking up on social cues such as gestures, facial expressions and changes in gaze direction.However, it's probably just one part of a larger brain network involved in recognising others through motion.Real-world applicationsMotion-based identity traits aren't as stable or specific as fingerprints or DNA. They're what researchers call soft biometrics: useful but not always accurate.But as we better understand the link between motion and identity, exciting real-world applications are emerging.Motion analysis could support contactless identity verification from gait-based authentication at airports to gesture-based identification in smart environments, such as homes that respond to a user's unique movement patterns. In clinical settings, movement analysis might help support people with social cognition impairments, face recognition or movement issues. For example, helping a doctor identify changes in the way a patient produces non-verbal cues.But many questions remain. We still aren't sure how consistent motion fingerprints are as someone gets older and in different contexts. Individual differences in people and environmental factors like lighting, clothing or stress could affect them.Researchers also aren't sure how exactly we manage to understand all this movement in everyday life without even thinking about it.Figuring this out could not only help improve technologies like social robots and develop tools for people with recognition and communication difficulties, but also tell us more about how we process and react to other people.

Britain agrees to drop mandate for Apple to provide 'back door',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/britain-agrees-to-drop-mandate-for-apple-to-provide-back-door/articleshow/123395824.cms,"Representative Image





SAN FRANCISCO: The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Britain to spare Apple from a request that the company create a tool to give British law enforcement organisations access to customers' cloud data.Tulsi Gabbard, US director of national intelligence, said Monday night that Britain had ""agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties.""Britain's decision to back off the policy comes after Apple spent months lobbying officials in Washington and rolled back an encrypted storage feature for British users. In the face of govt pressure around the world, the company has been resolute that it won't create a back door that allows access to phones or encrypted user data because it is afraid such a tool could be abused.Much of Apple's predicament in Britain played out in private after the govt issued a secret order this year. The request came after Britain amended its Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which allows it to compel companies to turn over data and communications to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Apple helped make the secret order public by declaring in Feb that iPhone users in Britain would begin seeing messages on their phones saying the company no longer offered its Advanced Data Protection feature. The capability, which remained available in the US, had allowed British users to encrypt almost all of their iCloud data, including messages,notes, photos and backups.Gabbard said Britain's agreement would ""ensure Americans' private data remains private and our Constitutional rights and civil liberties are protected."" nyt",Britain drops mandate for apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of american citizens.

Swiss watchmaker Swatch has apologised and withdrawn an advertisement after it sparked anger in China for being racist.The ad showed an Asian male model pulling the corners of his eyes, a gesture widely criticised online as offensive. Chinese social media users accused the company of racism and called for a boycott of its products.On Saturday, Swatch said in posts on Instagram and Weibo that it had removed the campaign worldwide. “We sincerely apologise for any distress or misunderstanding this may have caused,” the company wrote.But many online said the apology was not enough. A popular Weibo user with more than one million followers accused Swatch of “racism against Chinese” and urged regulators to take action.Others claimed the ""slant-eye"" gesture"" was deliberate discrimination and demanded a boycott. ""The brand's image has collapsed. (Swatch) thinks they can just apologise and salvage everything? It's not that simple,"" one user wrote.China is among Swatch Group’s biggest markets, but like other Western luxury brands, the company has struggled with falling sales as the economy slows and buyers shift to cheaper options. In July, the group reported an 11.2 percent fall in net sales in the first half of the year, blaming weak demand in China.Swatch is not the first brand to face such criticism. Dolce & Gabbana faced backlash in 2018 for ads showing a Chinese model awkwardly using chopsticks, and Dior was accused of racism in 2023 over a photo of a model pulling her eye corner.","Chinese social media users accused swatch of racism and called for a boycott of its products.

Oman is set to unveil a new golden visa programme for investors on August 31, 2025, aiming to attract global investments and accelerate the country’s digital transformation in commerce. This launch forms part of broader initiatives including support for high-performing local companies and reforms to facilitate easier business processes.The golden visa programme offers investors long-term residency permits, reflecting Oman’s strategy to establish itself as a global investment hub. Mubarak bin Mohammed Al Douhani, Director-General of Planning at the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Investment Promotion, highlighted the programme’s role in fostering a sustainable business environment by merging regulatory reforms with sustained support for local firms. The Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Investment Promotion said the programme will be launched alongside the “Al Majida Companies” initiative, designed to support high-performing Omani firms, and a new service enabling the electronic transfer of commercial registrations via the “Oman Business” platform.Alongside the visa programme, Oman will launch a streamlined digital platform for electronic transfer of commercial registrations, marking a significant step toward a complete digital trade ecosystem.This system aims to save time and reduce operational costs for businesses, while promoting transparency and easier business administration.The launch event in Salalah will include signing cooperation agreements with key institutions such as Sultan Qaboos University, the German University of Technology, the Oman Energy Association, and Ebinaa. These collaborations are designed to harness academic expertise and private sector strengths to fuel innovation and growth in Oman’s construction industry.Oman’s golden visa programme and digital trade reforms reflect a concerted effort to attract investment, support economic diversification, and modernize regulatory frameworks. By facilitating long-term residency for investors and cutting red tape through digital tools, Oman aims to nurture a robust, innovative business environment that benefits both local companies and international investors.The launch of the golden visa programme also aligns closely with Oman’s long-term national strategy under Vision 2040, which focuses on reducing the country’s reliance on oil and expanding its non-oil economic base. As part of this strategy, the government has set clear targets to decrease oil’s share of GDP by 15% by 2030 and a further 18% by 2040. Investments are being directed into priority sectors including logistics, manufacturing, real estate, information technology, renewable energy, and tourism—areas identified for sustainable growth and foreign direct investment. These economic and social reforms are designed to enhance private sector participation, generate employment for Omani nationals, and support ongoing efforts to digitize business and government services, ensuring a more resilient and diversified national economy.Oman’s golden visa rollout positions the sultanate alongside other Gulf nations implementing similar long-term residency schemes to attract capital, talent, and strategic investment. These programmes reflect a regional shift toward building diversified, investor-friendly economies.Through theplatform, Oman offers two investment residency tiers. A 10-year visa is available for individuals investing a minimum of 500,000 OMR (approx. $1.3 million USD) in a limited liability company, public joint-stock company, government bonds, or real estate. This tier is also granted to those who establish a company employing at least 50 Omani nationals. The application fee is 551 OMR (approx. $1,430 USD). A 5-year visa is available for a 250,000 OMR (approx. $650,000 USD) investment in the same categories. Expatriates who wish to retire in Oman can apply for a 5-year residence permit by demonstrating a fixed monthly income of 4,000 OMR (approx. $10,400 USD). The retirement visa carries a fee of 326 OMR (approx. $845 USD).In the UAE, the golden visa system was introduced in 2019 and offers renewable 5- and 10-year visas without the requirement of a local sponsor. The visa includes residency benefits for spouses, children, and parents. Eligibility spans multiple categories such as investors, entrepreneurs, doctors, scientists, artists, humanitarian pioneers, outstanding students, content creators, yacht owners, and frontline workers. Most categories require nomination and fulfillment of specific sector-related criteria or investments.Bahrain’s golden residency visa was launched in 2022. It grants holders the right to live and work in the Kingdom, includes family sponsorship, and allows unlimited entry and exit. To qualify, applicants must have resided in Bahrain for five years and earn a monthly salary of at least 2,000 BHD (approx. $5,306 USD)It is a new long-term residency permit system launching on August 31, 2025, aimed at attracting global investors by providing them with stability and growth opportunities in Oman.The Ministry of Commerce, Industry, and Investment Promotion announced the programmes, with the launch event set to be held in Salalah.The “Al Majida Companies” initiative supports high-performing Omani firms, and a new digital system enables electronic transfer of commercial registrations through the “Oman Business” platform.It reduces time and costs for businesses, enhances transparency, and streamlines trade operations toward a fully digital business environment.","Oman is set to unveil a new golden visa programme on august 31, 2025.

The central government’s ban on real-money gaming is creating challenges for venture capital investors, as startups valued at nearly $15 billion and having raised around $2 billion try to figure out their next steps.“We’ve made huge investments and are bound to face major capital losses… at this point though the efforts are towards finding out what can be done next,” a New Delhi-based venture capital investor, who has backed real-money companies, was quoted as saying by ET.“Real-money gaming companies, essentially, are consumer platforms with a large user base that can be leveraged for other offerings,” the investor said.WinZO, one of India’s top social gaming platforms, has removed all games affected by the new Online Gaming Regulation Bill, 2025. Following this, other major gaming companies have made similar moves. Dream11 has ended all paid contests to operate only as a free-to-play platform, and Games24x7 has halted real-money games on My11Circle.While Dream Sports, the parent company of India’s leading fantasy sports app Dream11, is piloting a wealth management product, WinZO Games is entering the US market and introducing micro-drama content.Dream11 has also informed the BCCI that it cannot continue as Team India’s title sponsor due to revenue losses, reported PTI.Global and domestic investors like Tiger Global, Z47, Think Investments, Peak XV Partners, and Malabar Investments have backed firms such as Dream Sports, MPL, Games24x7, and Zupee, all of which are now facing regulatory challenges.“These companies are going to be, not just for us, but for everyone, going to be very largely a write-off, because the business is shut effectively. They all have cash in the bank, because they made a lot of money,” Rehan Yar Khan, the managing partner of Orios Venture Partners, was quoted as saying by the Economic Times.“Since there was always a regulatory overhang over real money gaming, we took a very tiny experimental exposure. So, from the over Rs 2,000 crore that we manage, we invested only Rs 5 crore, that too across two funds in real money gaming,” he added.Nazara Technologies, the only publicly listed company exposed to real-money gaming, saw its market capitalization fall by Rs 2,164.9 crore last week following the government’s ban.Despite the challenges, some investors remain hopeful that the regulatory shakeout could spur innovation. “Most of the VC investors who have invested in gaming did not just come in for RMG. They believe in the long-term evolution of India’s gaming ecosystem. There are pivots and options these companies can explore, because gaming is still a very nascent industry in India,” one investor was quoted as saying by ET.Real-money games account for nearly 86 percent of India’s gaming revenue. The sector generates around Rs 31,000 crore annually, contributes Rs 20,000 crore in taxes, supports over two lakh jobs, and has drawn more than Rs 25,000 crore in foreign investment.In the Fiscal Year of 2023, Dream11 posted Rs 6,580.8 crore in revenue and Rs 443.6 crore profit, as cited by Tracxn, though its FY24 and FY25 results are pending. Games24x7 reported Rs 2,023 crore revenue with a Rs 199.6 crore loss in FY23, while Gameskraft earned Rs 3,521.4 crore revenue and Rs 947.8 crore profit in FY24, reported ET.","Real-money games account for nearly 86 percent of india’s gaming revenue.

Sivanandan to take charge as Tata Digital CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sivanandan-to-take-charge-as-tata-digital-ceo/articleshow/123514235.cms,".

Mumbai: Sajith Sivanandan will take over as CEO of Tata Digital (TD) in Sept, succeeding Naveen Tahilyani, who vacated the position in May this year. Sivanandan will be the third CEO of TD since the e-commerce venture was launched by the Tata Group six years ago.
