Visa Chaos: Trump’s $100K H1-B Rule EXPLAINED; Who Pays & Who Escapes | WATCH

Poll Do you think the new H-1B visa changes will make it harder for companies to hire foreign talent? Yes, it will be tougher No, companies will adapt

Cap exemptions



Scrutiny of third-party placements



Employer compliance



Restrict employment-based green cards







The Donald Trump administration is pushing for a major overhaul of the H-1B visa program, going beyond the initial shock of the $100,000 fee that is now mandatory for all companies that want to file H-1B petition to hire staff from foreign countries. The proposals, formally listed in the Federal Register under the title of 'Reforming the H-1B Nonimmigrant Visa Classification Program' include several technical aspects which will impact the hiring of Indians.Department of Homeland Security, in its proposed draft, said: “The specialty occupation definition also clarifies that although the position may allow for a range of qualifying degree fields, each of the fields must be directly related to the duties of the position.”This modifies the softening that was done by the Biden administration to mean that there must be a logical connection between the degree and job duties. The Trump administration emphasizes direct relation, instead of mere logical connection. This would restrict who can be hired for which role.DHS plans to review and potentially narrow which employers and positions are exempt from the annual cap, affecting nonprofit research organizations, universities, and health care institutions that currently benefit from exemptions, Newsweek reported.Companies that place H-1B workers at other firms’ worksites, a common practice in the technology and consulting sectors, will come under more scrutiny.More scrutiny of companies that previously violated wage or labor condition rules.This may stop employers use the O-1A visas and national interest waivers to hire high-skilled foreign nationals. O-1A visas are for individuals with an extraordinary ability in the sciences, education, business, or athletics (not including the arts, motion pictures or television industry).The visa fee hike threw the IT companies into disarray initially, as companies rushed to call back all H-1Bs to the US. But the administration later clarified that it was for new petitions and now the fee has got legally challenged. Tech startups will have to hire American graduates as they cannot possibly pay $100,000 for foreign hirings but companies like Nvidia will not have much difficulty. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said his company will keep sponsoring H-1Bs and bear all related costs.","Trump administration is working on new immigration restriction rules.

Sridhar Vembu’s humble response



Features and challenges





Zoho’s homegrown messaging app Arattai recently gained immense popularity. Rival to WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal the app surged to the top spot in India’s app stores. The app has now received attention from Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra . Recently, Mahindra took to social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to reveal that he has downloaded the Arattai app, prompting a response from Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu. Launched in 2021, Arattai—meaning “chat” in Tamil—was initially seen as a niche side project. But in the wake of AI anxieties, spyware scandals, and scrutiny of Big Tech, its pitch as a “spyware-free, made-in-India messenger” has struck a chord with users. The app’s rise was fueled by endorsements from government officials, including Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who urged Indians to adopt indigenous platforms under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative.Mahindra Group chairman and industrialist Anand Mahindra recently gave a public shoutout to Zoho’s messaging app Arattai. Mahindra revealed that he has downloaded the app ‘with pride’. His post on X (formerly Twitter) read: “Downloaded @Arattai today… With pride.”The post shared by Mahindra quickly went viral as many praised him for endorsing an Indian-made tech solution.Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu warmly responded to Mahindra’s gesture and also expressed gratitude.Along with this, he also reaffirmed his firm’s commitment to improve the app. “I was in a meeting in our Tenkasi office with our Arattai engineers, working out refinements to the app and a team member showed this tweet. Thank you @anandmahindrathis gives us even more determination,” wrote Vembu.Arattai offers familiar features such as:* One-to-one and group chats with text, voice notes, and media sharing* Audio and video calls with end-to-end encryption* Multi-device support, including desktop and Android TV apps* Stories and channels for broadcasting updatesHowever, the app is still ironing out issues. Users have reported OTP delays, slower contact sync, and call glitches due to server overload.

Real-world lessons over instant gratification







Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has an important and surprising piece of advice for young people who are dreaming of entrepreneurial success. Bezos said ‘Go work at McDonald’s.’ As reported by Fortune, in a recent interview, Bezos stressed on the importance of early work experience especially in the fast-paced, customer-facing environment. “I always advise young people: Go work at McDonald’s,” Bezos said. “You learn responsibility. You learn how to show up. You learn how to deal with people. You learn how to hustle.”For those unaware, Bezos started Amazon out of his garage in 1994. He believes that entry-level jobs such as those at McDonald’s tech foundational skills which are important for long term success. He emphasised that such small roles are necessary as they instill skill like discipline, resilience and the ability to handle pressure. These are the traits that many Gen Z entrepreneurs may overlook in their rush to build startups.The comments by Bezos come at a time when debate is growing over the value of traditional work experience versus the allure of instant digital success. With platforms like TikTok and YouTube offering rapid fame and monetization, Bezos’ advice serves as a reminder that grit and consistency still matter.Jeff Bezos also stressed that the working environments like McDonald’s exposes Gratification. He noted that the working environment such as McDonald’s expose young people to real world challenges such as managing time, dealing with customers and working as part of a team. Bezos argue that these experiences are more valuable than any theoretical knowledge or online hustle. “You don’t need to start a company at 20,” he added. “You need to learn how the world works first.”",Amazon founder jeff bezos has an important and surprising piece of advice for young people who are dreaming of entrepreneurial success.

In the rapidly evolving world of AI-powered content, Elon Musk has taken a bold step forward. On October 5, 2025, he unveiled Grok Imagine Version 0.9, a major update to his AI platform designed to generate text, images, and videos with unprecedented speed, accuracy, and realism across multiple creative formats, including virtual reality environments and interactive storytelling. This launch comes just days after OpenAI’s Sora 2 release on September 30, intensifying the competition in AI video generation, creative technology, and immersive digital experiences.Musk’s announcement underscores his ambition to transform both the entertainment and gaming industries through generative AI, while also sparking debate about the potential limitations, job displacement, societal impact, and ethical considerations of AI-generated content.Grok Imagine 0.9 introduces several cutting-edge improvements that make AI content generation faster and more versatile than ever. Musk detailed these features on X (formerly Twitter):These upgrades highlight Musk’s goal of creating a multi-functional AI platform capable of producing movies, short videos, and interactive media at scale.Musk’s vision extends beyond video and image creation. In a recent X post, he revealed that his xAI game studio plans to release a “great” AI-generated video game before the end of 2026.A shared clip demonstrated a rudimentary first-person shooter, reminiscent of popular titles like Call of Duty, showcasing the potential of AI in gaming.To further this initiative, xAI is actively hiring a Video Games Tutor, offering $45–$100 per hour to train Grok to produce “engaging, fun, and innovative video games.” The role emphasises AI-assisted game design, including accurate annotations, iterative testing, and fostering interactive entertainment. This development aligns with industry trends. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney predicts that AI prompts will allow small development teams to create games on the scale of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, unlocking entirely new genres and gameplay experiences previously impossible without AI.Despite the excitement, many industry experts remain cautious about AI’s creative capabilities. Michael “Cromwelp” Douse, publishing director at Larian Studios, emphasized that AI cannot replace human leadership, vision, or storytelling. According to Douse, AI-generated content may lack the emotional resonance and artistry required to truly engage audiences.Critics also point to the challenge of maintaining cultural and creative authenticity in both video games and movies. While AI can produce technically perfect results, the human touch—the skill, imagination, and cultural insight—remains central to crafting meaningful experiences.Musk’s ambitions are equally significant in the film industry. He recently predicted that Grok will produce a movie that is “at least watchable before the end of next year” and will deliver high-quality films by 2027. A six-second video clip of generic Hollywood-style action accompanied the tweet, illustrating the AI’s growing cinematic capabilities.However, generative AI in movies has sparked controversy. The emergence of AI-generated actors, such as Tilly Norwood, has elicited backlash from Hollywood. Furthermore, concerns about copyright infringement persist, as AI platforms—including Grok—have faced legal challenges for generating content using copyrighted characters. For instance, Grok-generated images of Nintendo’s mascot were removed from Twitter due to takedown notices. Disney and Universal have also taken legal action against AI companies for unauthorized use of their characters. Grok Imagine 0.9 represents a pivotal moment in AI content generation, bridging the worlds of video, film, and gaming. Musk’s predictions indicate a future where AI can create movies, games, and interactive experiences with unprecedented speed, while also raising questions about ethics, creativity, and copyright.Industry experts argue that while AI is a powerful tool, human creativity and oversight remain essential. The future of AI-driven filmmaking and gaming will likely involve a hybrid approach, combining AI’s technical efficiency with the artistry and vision of human creators.","Elon musk’s grok imagine 0.9 boosts ai video, text, and image creation.

Big AI bets under scrutiny







JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon recently gave a clear warning about the disruption power of artificial intelligence. Dimon believes that job losses are inevitable, but so is the opportunity to retain and deploy workers into new roles. As reported by Business Insider, In an interview with Bloomberg TV, Dimon said that the bank has invested about $2 billion as an annual investment in AI and is already making $2 billion in direct benefits. This includes the headcount reductions and operational savings. “We know about $2 billion of actual cost saves,” he said. “It’s the tip of the iceberg.”Dimon also talked about layoffs and he did not shy away from the workforce implications. “People shouldn’t put their head in the sand. It is going to affect jobs,” he said. “AI will enhance some aspects of work, but also eliminate some jobs.” However, Dimon also stressed on the fact that JPMorgan is focused on retaining and redeploying employees whose roles are impacted by automation. “We’ll have more jobs, but there’ll probably be less jobs in certain functions,” Dimon added. “You’re better off being way ahead of the curve,” Dimon added.Dimon also revealed that JPMorgan has been integrating AI since 2012. He said that AI now touches every part of the bank starting from rest and fraud detection to marketing and customer service. The bank also used AI for idea generation. he bank’s proprietary large language model, trained on internal data, is used by 150,000 employees weekly. “It’s quite productive,” Dimon noted. “Our managers and leaders have to do it. ”Dimon’s remakes come at a time when skepticism is growing about the massive corporate spending spree on AI. Meta is planning to spend around $600 billion on AI infrastructure by 2028. On the other hand, OpenAI and Oracle have announced a $500 billion data center project dubbed Stargate.A recent Goldman Sachs report warned that many firms investing billions in AI have yet to see measurable returns. “AI technology is exceptionally expensive,” said Jim Covello, head of global equity research at Goldman Sachs. “Even basic summarization tasks often yield illegible and nonsensical results.”","Jpmorgan chase ceo jamie dimon believes that job losses are inevitable, but so is the opportunity to retain and deploy workers into new roles.

What the analysis said about GTA 6’s price



“Our research shows that 59% of consumers have some interest in purchasing GTA 6, highlighting the appeal and commercial potential of the game,”

“This notoriety also makes GTA 6 the perfect test case to understand consumer expectations around video game pricing. Our findings should serve as a caution to game developers looking to raise game prices in the future,”





GTA 6 is expected to generate more revenue at the standard $70 price point than at a higher $100 price, a new analysis claims. A study by MIDiA Research (seen by IGN) suggests that pricing the highly anticipated game at $100 would deter potential buyers and ultimately result in lower overall earnings for developer Rockstar.said Perry Gresham, co-author of the report and Head of Data at MIDiA Research. “A $100 price point would actually leave money on the table,” he added.The study also indicates that raising the game’s price beyond $70, which it describes as an “optimum” point, could lead to lower revenue due to fewer people buying GTA 6.said co-author and Games Analyst at MIDiA, Brandon Sutton.Sutton added.According to the survey results from over 2,000 US consumers, 60% of those interested in GTA 6 said they would ‘definitely’ or ‘probably’ purchase the game at $69.99. To compare, 35% said they would ‘definitely’ or ‘probably’ buy it at $99.99.The study also found that only 16% of consumers would buy the game at $149.99, while 79% of those interested in GTA 6 said they would ‘definitely’ or ‘probably’ purchase it at $49.99.Rockstar is expected to announce the game’s official price closer to its release date, which is set for May 26, 2026.

“Intel has unfortunately been punished on a few areas.”

What Arm CEO Rene Haas said about Intel’s missed opportunities



“There are long product cycles. It takes a long time to develop chips.

It takes a long time to invest in fabs. It takes a long time to define architectures and ecosystems. If you miss a few time is very…you will be punished for that. I think Intel has unfortunately been punished on a few areas. They were punished on mobile, obviously, they missed that completely. They were also punished in terms of manufacturing of going to EUV, an advanced methodology for building the smallest chips on the planet.

They decided not to invest in that probably a decade ago at the rate that TSMC did, and they fell behind.”

“Once you fall behind in chips, it's very difficult to catch up because the cycle gets on top of you. TSMC now has the best fabs in the world. The leading-edge companies, Apple, NVIDIA, AMD, they all build at TSMC. TSMC gets better at what they're building. An Intel, a Samsung, they don't get the opportunities. It just compounds. And that flywheel once it compounds and it compounds, it's very hard to catch up in a series of position,”

Rene Haas on cultural divide in semiconductor industry



“I mean, we may have had it a generation or so ago. I don't know that we have it now. And we certainly haven't trained a generation of folks to look at manufacturing jobs as being something that is as lucrative and prestigious. They're sort of thinking, ‘Oh, it's a blue collar job. I don't want to go into that way.’ It's not viewed that way in Taiwan, right? And in Taiwan, if you say you're working for TSMC or studying to go off and do that, it's a highly prestigious kind of thing,”





Arm CEO Rene Haas suggested that Intel could face challenges in matching TSMC’s position as a major chip foundry. The chief executive of the UK-based semiconductor and software design company stated that once a company falls behind in the semiconductor industry, recovery is an uphill climb. In a recent All-in Podcast, Haas, while commenting on the debate about whether Intel could serve as a viable US-based alternative to the Taiwanese chip manufacturer, said thatHe also pointed out the opportunities that the US-based chip maker missed, explaining why all the leading companies like Apple and Nvidia are flocking to build from TSMC.At the podcast, Haas said:Haas explained.In addition, Haas noted cultural differences in how manufacturing is viewed, stating that while such jobs are respected in Taiwan, they are often perceived as less appealing in the West, which could impact the long-term stability of US manufacturing.he noted.","Arm ceo rene haas suggested that intel could face challenges in matching tsmc’s position as a major chip foundry.

Mira Murati’s growing influence in Silicon Valley’s AI ecosystem





Mira Murati, former OpenAI Chief Technology Officer is backing a new artificial intelligence (AI) venture launched by one of her former colleagues, Angela Jiang. According to a Business Insider report, Jiang – an early OpenAI product manager has started a startup called Worktrace AI. The publication claims to have reviewed documents which reveal that Worktrace AI was in talks this summer to raise $10 million in seed funding at a $50 million valuation.Jiang, who joined OpenAI as its third product manager, played a key role in developing the GPT models that powered ChatGPT’s viral success in late 2022. She later worked on OpenAI’s policy team before leaving in December 2024.Worktrace AI joins a growing list of startups founded by OpenAI alumni — including Murati’s Thinking Machines Lab, Ilya Sutskever’s Safe Superintelligence, and William Fedus’s Periodic Labs — that have quickly attracted billion-dollar valuations before releasing a commercial product.Mira Murati’s involvement in Worktrace AI follows her own major project, Thinking Machines Lab, which raised $2 billion in seed funding earlier this year and reached a valuation of $12 billion. Her growing role as a backer of emerging AI companies signals her influence in shaping the next generation of artificial intelligence research and enterprise solutions.Like Murati’s venture, Worktrace AI is focused on bringing advanced automation to large enterprises.According to its website, the company helps businesses “find and automate repetitive tasks by observing employees.”Worktrace AI has attracted funding from several prominent OpenAI figures, including Nick Turley, head of ChatGPT; Jason Kwon, OpenAI’s chief strategy officer; and Joanne Jang, who helped define ChatGPT’s behavior, according to a job listing. The company is also backed by the OpenAI Startup Fund, along with venture capital firms 8VC and Conviction.Despite having an active website and LinkedIn profile, the company has not made any public announcements about its launch.","Mira murati, former openai chief technology officer is backing a new artificial intelligence (ai) venture launched by one of her former colleagues, angela jiang.

BRUSSELS: The EU Friday demanded digital giants including Snapchat and YouTube explain how they are protecting children from online harm, as all but two member states signalled openness to restricting social media access for minors.The European Union has stringent rules regulating the digital space, including what children should be able to see, but there is increasing concern that more needs to be done. Inspired by Australia’s social media ban for under-16s, Brussels is analysing whether to set bloc-wide limits on minors’ access to platforms — with 25 of 27 EU countries coming out Friday in support of at least studying such a measure.Europe’s biggest weapon for ensuring platforms tackle illegal content and keep children safe online is the Digital Services Act, which has sparked censorship claims from the US tech sector and retaliation threats from President Donald Trump.Now, as part of “investigative actions” under the DSA, the European Commission has sent a request for information to Snapchat about what steps it is taking to prevent access for children under 13.The commission has also asked Apple ’s App Store and the Google Play marketplace to provide details on measures taken to prevent children downloading illegal or harmful apps — for example, those with gambling services or sexual content.",Eu demands digital giants including snapchat and youtube explain how they are protecting children from online harm.
