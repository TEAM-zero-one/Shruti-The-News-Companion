"Transport ministry approves mandatory ABS in all 2-wheelers, 2 helmets with new bikes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/transport-ministry-approves-mandatory-abs-in-all-2-wheelers-2-helmets-with-new-bikes/articleshow/121936957.cms,".

NEW DELHI: In a move to improve safety of two-wheeler riders, the road transport ministry has decided to make the anti-lock braking systems (ABS) mandatory for all new scooties, bikes and motorcycles manufactured after January next year irrespective of their engine capacity. The ministry will also soon make it mandatory for manufacturers and dealers to provide two BIS-certified helmets with two-wheelers at the time of sale.Officials said the decisions are important considering that two-wheeler occupants have nearly 44% share of all road deaths in the country and most of these are due to head injuries caused because of not wearing safety gear.The notifications for both these regulations will be out in the next few days.“At present, ABS is mandatory only in two-wheelers having engine capacity of over 125cc and so nearly 45% bikes and motorcycles don’t have this. With the new notification, this will be applicable for all new bikes and motorcycles. As almost all these vehicles can achieve 70 kmph, this feature becomes all the more important to reduce chances of crashes,” said a ministry official.ABS is a safety feature that prevents wheel lock-up during sudden braking, enhancing control and reducing stopping distances, especially on slippery roads. According to different studies and estimates, ABS can reduce road crashes by 35-45%.On the decision to provide two certified helmets at the time of sale, an official said this is aimed at inculcating a behaviour among bike riders to use safe helmets. Till now, it’s mandatory to provide one helmet.","The road transport ministry has decided to make the anti-lock braking systems (abs) mandatory for all new scooties, bikes and motorcycles manufactured after january next year.

India kicks off much-needed review of arms procurement procedures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-kicks-off-much-needed-review-of-arms-procurement-procedures/articleshow/121955168.cms,"Review of its cumbersome defence acquisition procedure (DAP) of 2020.

NEW DELHI: India has kicked off the much-needed comprehensive review of its cumbersome defence acquisition procedure (DAP) of 2020, with the aim to slash timelines in procurement of weapon systems and platforms as well as promote self-reliance in design, development and production with greater private sector participation.The defence ministry on Thursday said a committee headed by additional secretary and director general (acquisition) Dipti Mohil Chawla, which includes senior officers and representatives from the industry and academia, has already begun consultations with all stakeholders.Former health and I&B secretary Apurva Chandra, who had a stint as the DG (acquisition) in MoD, is the principal advisor to the committee. “The panel has invited suggestions from stakeholders on various fronts, including procedural changes to streamline the acquisition processes, by July 5,” an official said.The aim of the DAP review is to meet the operational requirements and modernisation of the armed forces “in a timely manner to ensure national security” and align acquisition procedures with govt policies to achieve “atmanirbharta” (self-reliance) by promoting technology infusion through indigenously designed and developed systems.“The ‘Make in India’ policy also needs to be enabled by promoting defence manufacturing in India through facilitation of JVs and transfer of technology for the private sector, encouraging foreign arms manufacturers via FDI alignment, and establishing a global defence manufacturing and MRO hub here,” he said.“The idea is also to promote design and development in both public and private sectors, with a focus on start-ups, innovators, and the private defence industry for indigenous technology infusion,” he added.At present, it often takes several years after a case gets the initial `acceptance of necessity’ (AoN), which is followed by the floating of the initial tender or the RFP (request for proposal), field trials, commercial evaluation and the like, before the final contract is anywhere close to being inked.Defence secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh recently said that the timelines for some of the processes in the procurement cycle have already been slashed, which would save around 69 weeks overall.“There is a need to shift away from the traditional nomination based cost-plus procurement focused mostly on the public sector to a more competitive pricing model where both the public and private sector can compete for orders. This approach is already being implemented for ship-building and recently for the AMCA (advanced medium combat aircraft or the fifth-generation fighter) project,” he said.The MoD in the 2024-25 fiscal completely utilised the defence modernisation budget for the first time in the last five years. Moreover, contracts worth Rs 2 lakh crores were inked, which is the highest ever and double that of the figures in 2023-24, he added.The AMCA project, for one, certainly needs to be majorly fast-tracked after the defence ministry last month finally approved a new “programme execution model” for prototype development, with greater private sector participation. Pakistan is on course to acquire at least 40 J-35A fifth-generation jets from China, which is now even flaunting sixth-generation prototypes with tailless airframes like Chengdu J-36 and Shenyang J-50, as reported by TOI earlier.The long meandering developmental history of the fourth-generation Tejas, which began way back in 1983, cannot be repeated. The IAF is still waiting to get the first Tejas Mark-1A `improved’ fighter. Similarly, indigenous development of 110 Kilonewton engines, with or without foreign collaboration, to power the AMCA is critical. The IAF is currently grappling with just 30 fighter squadrons (each has 16-18 jets) when 42.5 are authorised.","India has kicked off the much-needed comprehensive review of its cumbersome defence acquisition procedure (dap) of 2020.

It’s important to note that these

warning notices and an investigation report are not related to the Air India AI 171 Boeing 787 crash that happened on June 12.

What DGCA warned Air India about

The aviation regulator's report quoted in the Reuters report revealed that during May inspections, three Air India Airbus aircraft were found operating with overdue mandatory checks on escape slides, which are vital emergency equipment.

An Airbus A320 aircraft's inspection was conducted on May 15, more than a month behind schedule. During this period, AirNav Radar tracking showed the aircraft served international routes including Dubai, Riyadh and Jeddah.

The findings also highlighted that an Airbus A319, used for domestic flights, had checks delayed by over three months, whilst another aircraft's inspection was conducted two days late.

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation had issued a warning to Air India regarding safety protocol violations, as three of the airline’s Airbus aircraft continued operations despite pending inspections of emergency systems. The regulatory body also criticised the airline's delayed response in addressing these concerns, according to a Reuters report.These communications and warnings by DGCA were given to Air India days before the crash of the Dreamliner.The DGCA report said: ""The above cases indicate that aircraft were operated with expired or unverified emergency equipment, which is a violation of standard airworthiness and safety requirements.""Also Read | Air India crash: N Chandrasekaran makes important statement; says AI 171 Boeing 787 Dreamliner had ‘new engine’, ‘clean history’ & ‘no red flags’ The regulator noted that Air India ""failed to submit timely compliance responses"" to identified deficiencies, ""further evidencing weak procedural control and oversight.""The airline, acquired by the Tata Group in 2022 from the government, responded that it was ""accelerating"" the verification of all maintenance records, including escape slide dates, with completion expected within days.The carrier clarified that in one instance, the issue was discovered when an AI Engineering Services engineer accidentally deployed an escape slide during maintenance work.Safety checks on emergency escape slides are crucial, as their malfunction during accidents could result in grave consequences, according to Vibhuti Singh, who previously served as a legal expert at the government's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau.The aviation regulator DGCA said that aircraft failing to undergo mandatory inspections would have their airworthiness certificates considered suspended.Documentation reveals that Animesh Garg, who holds the position of deputy director of airworthiness in the Indian government, dispatched the warning notices and reports to Air India's CEO Campbell Wilson and other senior officials, including the continuing airworthiness manager, quality manager and head of planning.Also Read | Air India plane crash: After 12/6, demand for Air India's 787s crashes A legal specialist in aviation matters indicated that such violations typically result in financial and civil penalties for both the company and individual executives.In a previous statement to Reuters, Wilson acknowledged that whilst global parts shortages affected the industry broadly, Air India faced greater challenges due to its older fleet, with numerous aircraft remaining unmodernised since their delivery in 2010-2011.Aviation authorities across the globe, including India's regulatory body, impose penalties on airlines for breaching compliance requirements. In February, the government informed parliament about 23 instances where airlines faced warnings or penalties for safety violations in the previous year.Air India and Air India Express accounted for twelve of these violations, with one case involving ""unauthorised entry into the cockpit"". The carrier faced its heftiest penalty of $127,000 for insufficient oxygen supplies during a San Francisco-bound flight.","The directorate general of civil aviation had issued a warning to air india regarding safety protocol violations.

NEW DELHI: Air India CEO Campbell Wilson on Thursday said the Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner that crashed on June 12 was “well maintained,” with its last major inspection conducted in June 2023 and the next one due in December 2025.His comments came as the airline launched enhanced pre-flight safety checks across its Boeing 787 fleet, following the fatal crash of Flight AI171 that killed 241 passengers and crew and 34 people on the ground.“We are undertaking enhanced pre-flight safety checks on Boeing 787 fleet,” Wilson said in a message to passengers, adding that the temporary 15% reduction in Air India ’s widebody operations over the coming weeks is a precautionary measure.Providing further details, Wilson said, “The plane was well-maintained, with its last major check in June 2023 and the next scheduled for December 2025.

The remaining aircraft are undergoing scheduled maintenance and will return to operation only after additional safety reviews.“Following the review, the DGCA has confirmed that our Boeing 787 fleet and maintenance processes fully meet safety standards,” Wilson said.Expressing sorrow over the tragedy, Wilson added, “We are reaching out with heavy hearts following the tragic crash of Air India Flight AI171 on June 12, 2025.

Text messages and court drama reveal a hidden strain in the friendship

Travis Kelce stands by Taylor Swift as she distances herself from Lively

Once hailed as one of the most charming celebrity friendships, the bond between Taylor Swift and Blake Lively is now fractured beyond repair. The fallout stems from a $400 million lawsuit involving actor-director Justin Baldoni and Lively, where unexpected court revelations have dragged Swift’s name into the legal storm. According to sources close to the matter, the pop star is ""deeply wounded"" by how the situation has unfolded.The friendship, often displayed publicly at NFL games and star-studded events, came under scrutiny when Page Six reported that private text messages from Blake Lively were presented in court. In those messages, Lively referred to Swift as one of her “dragons”—a reference to Game of Thrones, but interpreted by many as dismissive or even manipulative.Though Swift is not a party to the lawsuit, her indirect association has sparked media frenzy, with insiders claiming, “even if she heals, the scar will remain.” The messages reportedly exposed a side of Lively that Swift never anticipated, casting doubt on the authenticity of their bond. “The friendship Lively portrayed with Swift wasn’t entirely accurate,” the source added, stating it was rooted more in lifestyle camaraderie than genuine personal connection.The Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce, Swift’s current boyfriend, has reportedly pledged to protect her emotionally during the turmoil. The lawsuit's public nature has added stress to Swift’s otherwise private life, especially as she balances her global Eras Tour with ongoing personal challenges.Their last public appearance together was during Super Bowl LVIII, cheering Kelce on from a VIP suite. But given the emotional toll of recent events, future public moments between the two women seem increasingly unlikely.This friendship unraveling shows how celebrity relationships can collapse under the weight of legal disputes and unwanted publicity. Taylor Swift's unintentional entanglement in Lively’s legal issues offers a sobering reminder: in the world of fame and billion-dollar lawsuits, even the strongest bonds can be tested—and sometimes broken—without warning.Also Read: Taylor Swift's texts exposed in Blake Lively court loss — will this strain the popstar's relationship with Travis Kelce?

Boston Bruins open to trading seventh overall pick for roster-ready player

Noah Dobson and Alexander Romanov floated as trade options

Trade talks expected to intensify as draft nears

The New York Islanders appear to be going all in ahead of the NHL Draft. According to multiple reports, they are aggressively pursuing a second top-10 pick to go alongside the one they already hold. The rumored goal is to select both star defenseman Matthew Schaefer and local standout forward James Hagens.The Boston Bruins, owners of the 7th overall pick, are reportedly willing to part with the selection if it lands them a player who can help immediately. Their front office has made it clear they are more focused on improving the current roster rather than adding another developmental prospect.According to reports from RG Media’s James Murphy and Stefan Rosney, talks between the Bruins and Islanders have become increasingly serious. Sources close to the situation suggest that Boston’s priority is to add a top-six forward or a top-four defenseman if they are to surrender such a valuable draft position.In order for the trade to materialize, the Islanders would have to offer more than draft capital. Reports indicate that defensemen Noah Dobson and Alexander Romanov, along with forward Jean-Gabriel Pageau, have come up in trade discussions.Among the trio, Dobson would be the most impactful piece.The 24-year-old logged a career-best season and has grown into one of the Islanders’ most dependable blue liners.With less than a week to go before the NHL Draft on June 27, time is ticking. The Islanders remain determined to secure their draft targets, while the Bruins weigh immediate returns against long-term prospects.This deal, if it happens, could reshape both rosters heading into the 2025–26 season. League observers now have June 27 circled, as this rumored transaction might be the headline moment of the draft.If the Islanders manage to pull off this trade, it would mark a bold shift in their strategy, signaling a true commitment to building a new core.

Iran has reportedly went for a near-total Internet Blackout Tuesday (June 17) as conflict with Israel deepened. According to a report by NBC News, the drop appears to be a result of a decision by Iran’s government, rather than Israeli strikes on infrastructure. The report quotes Kentinc and Netblocks, the two companies that track global internet connectivity. According to NBC News, quoting these companies, Iran’s internet connectivity plummeted around 5:30 p.m. local time, limiting Iranians’ ability to access and share information with the outside world.The internet slowdowns appeared to particularly affect services like virtual private networks (VPNs) used to access foreign sites. Data published by the internet services company Cloudflare found that two major Iranian mobile network providers were effectively disconnected.Fatemeh Mohajerani, a spokesperson for Iran’s government, reportedly said it had restricted internet access in response to Israeli cyberattacks.Iran’s government has historically shut down or reduced its internet connectivity with the outside world in times of civil unrest. In 2019, the country implemented a six-day full blackout as protesters took to the streets across the country and the government issued a crackdown on civilians, reportedly leading to the deaths of more than 100 people.Amir Rashidi, the director of digital rights and security at the Miaan Group, a nonprofit organization that advocates for human rights in Iran, reportedly said that some Western apps for communicating, including WhatsApp and Instagram have been blocked. He further said that app stores of Google and Apple -- Google Play Store and App Store -- had been blocked in Iran.A WhatsApp spokesperson told NBC News that its parent company, Meta, has been engaged in a cat-and-mouse game with Iran.Recently, in a statement to the news agency AP, WhatsApp said it was “concerned these false reports will be an excuse for our services to be blocked at a time when people need them the most.”“We do not track your precise location, we don’t keep logs of who everyone is messaging and we do not track the personal messages people are sending one another. We do not provide bulk information to any government,"" the messaging platfrom added.The report said that Iran’s National Information Network, a nationwide network of government-approved sites that are not connected to the outside world, has largely remained accessible to people in Iran. As internet services are restricted in the country, some people have called for Elon Musk’s satellite internet service provider, Starlink, to step in, the way it has in many parts of the world.","Iran reportedly went for a near-total internet blackout tuesday (june 17) as conflict with israel deepened.

Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis said about AI job warning

After Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ’s recent dismissal of apocalyptic job-loss predictions, Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has also dismissed the pessimistic predictions made by Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei . Recently, Amodei warned of significant white-collar job displacement, Hassabis and Huang present a more optimistic point of view. Speaking at the SXSW London festival, Hassabis stated that AI will disrupt traditional roles but also emphasised that it will also create valuable and new jobs, particularly for those with STEM skills and technical fluency. Hassabis has asked the students and professionals to embrace AI tools and also build foundational knowledge in math, physics, and computer science, calling them essential for navigating the AI-driven future.Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei warned that artificial intelligence could eliminate 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years, potentially driving US unemployment to 20%.

Huang specifically challenged Amodei’s recent claim that AI could eliminate up to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within five years, dismissing the notion as overly alarmist.“I pretty much disagree with almost everything [Amodei] says,” Huang stated, critiquing three key points he attributed to Amodei: that AI is so dangerous only a select few should develop it, that it’s too costly for widespread development, and that its power will lead to massive job losses. “If you want things to be done safely and responsibly, you do it in the open … Don’t do it in a dark room and tell me it’s safe,” Jensen Huang added, advocating for transparent and collaborative AI development.Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis has also expressed less concern about widespread job displacement due to AI.

Fresh stolen data could fuel next wave of online crime

Immediate action required for all users

Security researchers have uncovered an unprecedented data breach involving 16 billion login credentials across 30 databases, potentially affecting users of major platforms including Facebook Gmail , Apple, and countless other services. The discovery, made by CyberNews researchers during an ongoing investigation since January 2025, represents what could be the largest credential leak in history.The exposed datasets range dramatically in size, from smaller collections containing tens of millions of records to massive databases housing over 3.5 billion credentials each. The massive trove of stolen data was briefly accessible through unsecured databases before being locked down, though researchers were unable to identify the owners. Most concerning is that virtually all datasets were previously unreported, with only one 184-million-record database having been disclosed before by Wired magazine in May.The leaked credentials span virtually every major online service imaginable, creating a ""blueprint for mass exploitation,"" according to the research team. The databases contain login information for social media giants like Facebook and Instagram, email services including Gmail, developer platforms such as GitHub, messaging apps like Telegram, VPN services, and even government portals.Each record typically follows a standard format: website URL, username, and password. This structure matches the collection methods used by infostealer malware, malicious software designed to harvest sensitive information from infected devices.“Telegram's primary login method is a one-time-password delivered by SMS. As a result, this is far less relevant for Telegram users compared to other platforms where the password is always the same,” Telegram said in a statement to TOI.Unlike recycled data from old breaches, researchers emphasize this represents ""fresh, weaponizable intelligence at scale."" The credentials provide cybercriminals with unprecedented access for account takeovers, identity theft, and highly targeted phishing campaigns that can devastate both individuals and organizations.CyberNews researchers warn that new massive datasets emerge every few weeks, highlighting the pervasive nature of infostealer malware in today's digital landscape. The inclusion of recent logs with tokens, cookies, and metadata makes this data particularly dangerous for organizations lacking multi-factor authentication.With approximately 5.5 billion people having internet access globally, the breach potentially affects multiple accounts per person. Security experts recommend immediate password changes across all online accounts, enabling multi-factor authentication wherever possible, and using password managers to generate unique, strong passwords.Users are also advised to regularly monitor their accounts and consider using services like ""Have I Been Pwned"" to check if their credentials have been compromised.Apart from this, it's always better to use the latest software versions, enable automatic updates and access only secure, trusted URLs (preferably HTTPS) while avoiding links in unsolicited email messages.","Facebook, instagram, gmail and other account login details compromised in this massive data breach.

JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a warning to American businesses: the real labor crisis isn’t a worker shortage—it’s a skills shortage . Speaking at the Business Routable’s CEO Workforce Forum, Dimon asked the coperate leaders to not wait for the government fixes and should directly partner with the schools to close the growing talent gap. “What you’re really short of is the skills you need,” Dimon said, pointing to critical areas like cybersecurity, coding, project management, and financial literacy . He stressed that the companies must invest in education pipelines and push for curricula which blends job-ready credentials with traditional academics.Dimon who is an advocate of workforce development , feels that continous mismatch between available jobs and qualified candidates act as a threat to economic growth and innovation across multiple sectors ranging from advanced manufacturing and healthcare to technology and financial services.He also mentioned that global estimates suggest that 10 millions of jobs will go unfilled by 2030 due to lack of skilled talent.""We need to break down the barriers between education and employment ,"" Dimon stated at a recent economic summit. ""It's time to build a system that helps people learn, adapt, and thrive throughout their careers—not just at the start.""He asked for high-schools and colleges to offer workplace focused courses as part of their curriculum. The billionaire banker also stressed that businesses can’t rely solely on four-year degrees. “They all want jobs,” he said of young graduates. “But many end up in retail or inventory roles, when there are jobs in coding, cyber, and financial management.”Dimon is also calling for unprecedented collaboration between the private sector, government agencies, and educational institutions. He advocates for incentives for companies that invest in workforce training and increased public funding for apprenticeship programs and digital learning platforms.

Aylo wants Apple, Google to do age verification

France is Pornhub’s second-largest market

Why Aylo is against the age verification law

Major adult websites , including Pornhub , YouPorn, and RedTube, briefly went offline in France earlier this month to protest a new age verification law, according to France24. The law, which required these platforms to verify user ages using government-issued IDs or credit cards, was suspended on Friday (June 20) by a French court pending a review of its compatibility with European Union regulations, allowing the sites to resume operations.Aylo, the parent company of Pornhub, argued that the mandated age verification process posed significant security risks, including potential hacks and leaks of sensitive user data, as reported by France24. The company, which sees seven million daily visitors in France across its platforms, advocates for device-level age verification managed by tech giants like Microsoft, Apple, or Google, stating that the court’s suspension provides an “opportunity to reconsider more efficient approaches” to age verification. France24 also noted that the French government intends to appeal the suspension to the Council of State, France’s highest administrative court.Aylo’s push for device-level verification aligns with emerging tech solutions, such as Apple’s Screen Time or Microsoft’s Family Safety tools, which allow age restrictions to be set at the operating system level. However, implementing such systems globally remains complex due to varying privacy laws and technical standards across jurisdictions.France is Pornhub’s second-largest market globally, trailing only the United States, with the Philippines, Mexico, and the United Kingdom rounding out the top five countries by traffic, according to Aylo’s data. The company did not immediately respond to requests for further comment.The debate over age verification for adult websites extends beyond France. In the United States, 19 states, including Florida and Texas, have enacted similar laws, often requiring users to bypass restrictions using virtual private networks (VPNs). The United Kingdom and Germany also enforce age-related access controls for adult content, with the UK’s Digital Economy Act 2017 mandating strict age verification, though implementation has faced delays and challenges. Germany relies on a combination of self-regulation and legal frameworks to restrict access to adult sites for minors.Critics of such laws, including digital privacy advocates, argue that collecting sensitive personal information increases the risk of data breaches, citing incidents like the 2015 Ashley Madison hack, which exposed millions of users’ personal details. Supporters, however, emphasize the need to protect minors from accessing explicit content, with studies like one from the European Commission in 2023 indicating that over 20% of minors in the EU have encountered adult content online.The French government’s appeal to the Council of State will likely influence future regulatory approaches in the EU, where member states are increasingly grappling with balancing child safety and user privacy. For now, the suspension offers a temporary reprieve for adult platforms in France, but the broader debate over age verification continues to intensify globally.

Pre-emptive de-ageing

Flawed beauty standards





HYDERABAD: In Hyderabad, twenty-somethings are queuing up for fillers, boosters, and futuristic therapies, with little regard for long-term consequences. Beauty, it seems, is no longer about ageing gracefully, but preventing age from showing up altogether, finds Ajay TomarWeeks before her wedding, Latha (name changed) visited a Banjara Hills-based clinic to enhance her appearance for her big day.The bride-to-be underwent several non-surgical aesthetic treatments such as dermal ﬁllers to correct the asymmetry in her lips, enhance the deﬁ nition of her nose bridge, and sharpen her jawline for a slimmer facial proﬁle. She also went for additional ﬁ llers in her cheekbones to add contour as she felt it would highlight her natural features.Ditto for Seetha, who trooped into a Madhapur-based clinic to ﬁ x what she felt was sagging skin that made her look older than her age. She opted for a combination of high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) and botox injections to relax and slim her lower face to get a youthful appearance in a jiffy.Shockingly, neither Latha nor Seetha are battling midlife crises. While Latha is a 20-something, Seetha is in her early 30s.While the adage -‘Age is just a number’ – seems to no longer be the preserve of age-defying celluloid stars like Anil Kapoor, Nagarjuna, Madhuri Dixit and Preity Zinta, plastic surgeons point to an alarming trend – youngsters unhappy with their looks making a beeline for quickﬁ x anti-ageing procedures.Be it skin boosters, ﬁ llers, botox shots, laser treatments or even newer procedures, skin specialists say conscious youngsters are increasingly opting for minimally invasive and non-invasive skin prejuvenation and regeneration treatments in their quest to delay signs of ageing even before they show up.Cosmetology and dermatology clinics report that while about a decade ago, only about six to seven people would turn up for such procedures each week, all of them in the 40-plus bracket. Today, the number has shot up three to four times with most of them being youngsters.“Around eight to 10 years ago, most of our clients were in their 40s and above when wrinkles and skin sagging usually start showing. But now many in their mid-20s and early 30s are coming in to demand ageing prevention treatments,” says senior plastic surgeon Dr Priti Shukla.“A lot of the damage is already done by the time signs of ageing appear on the skin,” she adds.Apart from the smaller procedures, some are even opting for advanced treatments such platelet-rich plasma (PRP) therapy, HIFU, hybrid laser treatments and regenerative procedures such as exosome therapy that uses stem cells to improve collagen production, PDRN (polydeoxyribonucleotide) therapy and nano-fat grafting.Data too seems to back this emerging trend. US-based market research ﬁ rm Grand View Research pegs the Indian anti-ageing market at $2.5 billion in 2024 and projects it to reach $4 billion by 2033.So what is driving youth to such extremes in their pursuit for beauty? In an era of intense social media engagement and peer pressure, where the perfect selﬁ e and number of likes dictate the happiness quotient for many, the quest for that seductive pout or perfectly sculpted nose, well deﬁ ned chin or jawline, or ﬁ ne skin tone and perfect glow are pushing them to seek anti-ageing remedies. The supply surge also led to treatments becoming more affordable with costs varying from just Rs 5,000 to Rs 40,000 per session.“Over the past decade, there has been a rise in active social media presence and the culture of photo and video sharing, prompting individuals to observe their skin more closely and be critical about it,” explains plastic surgeon Dr Sumeera Farhath SK.Studies also point to the rising popularity of South Korean television shows, which frequently portray skincare as a daily routine, among Indian youth as a signiﬁ cant factor inﬂ uencing their growing interest in cosmetics and skincare. Notably, South Korea is the world leader in cosmetic treatments and plastic surgery.Senior psychologist Dr Pragya Rashmi says starting cosmetic enhancements at an early age could also be an indicator of one’s poor perception of self-esteem and body image.Consultant psychiatrist and lifestyle expert Dr Purnima Nagaraja points out that most opt for cosmetic enhancements due to a distorted sense of one’s own body image.“There is a significant difference between how people actually look and what society expects from them. Many individuals try to live up to the image of a perfect body, ﬂ awless hair, and ideal shape. This constant pressure is what drives many to go for cosmetic procedures.”","Twenty-somethings are queuing up for fillers, boosters, and futuristic therapies.

The technology sector's brutal workforce reduction continues into 2025, with industry giants Intel, Microsoft, Panasonic, Google , and Amazon leading a wave of layoffs that has already eliminated more than 62,000 jobs in the first half of the year. From semiconductor manufacturers to social media platforms, major tech companies are restructuring operations amid economic uncertainty and shifting business priorities, leaving tens of thousands of workers searching for new opportunities in an increasingly competitive market.The layoffs span across all sectors of technology, affecting everyone from established hardware manufacturers like Intel planning to cut up to 21,700 positions to fintech companies like Block eliminating nearly 1,000 workers, streaming platforms downsizing staff, and even space companies like Blue Origin cutting over 1,000 employees. With artificial intelligence reshaping business models and companies focusing on operational efficiency, the human cost of technological transformation has become starkly apparent as some of the world's most valuable companies simultaneously invest billions in AI while eliminating traditional roles.Intel announced the most devastating single layoff in the tech industry for 2025, planning to eliminate more than 21,000 employees, representing roughly 20% of its total workforce. The semiconductor giant's cuts come ahead of its Q1 earnings call under newly appointed CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who took over from longtime chief Pat Gelsinger. Additionally, Intel plans to lay off 15% to 20% of workers in its Intel Foundry division starting in July, affecting the unit that designs, manufactures, and packages semiconductors for external clients. With Intel's total workforce at 108,900 people as of December 2024, these combined reductions represent one of the largest single-company layoffs in tech history.Japanese electronics giant Panasonic announced it would cut 10,000 jobs, affecting approximately 4% of its total workforce as part of a comprehensive restructuring plan. CEO Yuki Kusumi said the cuts are designed to better prepare the century-old company for future decades, with 5,000 job losses expected in Japan and another 5,000 overseas. The company is trimming operations in non-growth areas such as televisions and industrial products to concentrate on emerging technologies, including artificial intelligence. Kusumi addressed the severity of the decision during an earnings call, stating he was ""truly sorry"" but emphasized that drastic cost structure cuts were necessary for the company to pursue growth.Microsoft implemented a multi-phase layoff strategy throughout 2025, first cutting over 6,500 jobs in May, affecting approximately 3% of its global workforce of 228,000 employees. The Seattle-headquartered company followed this with additional layoffs affecting software engineers, product managers, technical program managers, marketers, and legal counsels. The May cuts represent one of Microsoft's biggest layoffs since it eliminated 10,000 employees in 2023, and the company is reportedly contemplating further reductions that could happen through additional phases, with discussions about reducing middle managers and non-coding staff to increase the ratio of programmers to product managers.Meta announced it would cut 5% of its staff, targeting what CEO Mark Zuckerberg described as ""low performers"" as the company prepares for ""an intense year."" With more than 72,000 employees as of its latest quarterly report, the social media giant's cuts affect approximately 3,600 workers. The layoffs began in February and hit teams overseeing Facebook, the Horizon virtual reality platform, and logistics operations hardest. Meta also conducted additional layoffs in April, eliminating over 100 employees in its Reality Labs division, which manages virtual reality and wearable technology development for Meta's Quest headsets.HP announced it would eliminate up to 2,000 jobs as part of its ""Future Now"" restructuring plan designed to save the company $300 million before the end of its fiscal year. The cuts represent a significant portion of the computer and printer manufacturer's workforce as the company seeks to streamline operations and reduce costs. The restructuring comes as HP faces ongoing challenges in the traditional PC and printing markets, with the company pivoting toward more profitable business segments and operational efficiency improvements.Google implemented several rounds of layoffs throughout 2025, cutting hundreds of employees across multiple divisions. The search giant eliminated 200 workers in its global business unit, which handles partnerships and sales, while also laying off hundreds of employees in its platforms and devices division covering Android, Pixel phones, and the Chrome browser. Additional cuts affected the People Operations and cloud organizations teams as part of a broader reorganization effort. Google offered a voluntary exit program to U.S.-based People Operations employees while restructuring to ""drive greater collaboration and expand our ability to quickly and effectively serve customers.""Amazon conducted layoffs across multiple divisions, including approximately 100 employees from its devices and services division, which encompasses the Alexa voice assistant, Echo smart speakers, Ring video doorbells, and Zoox robotaxis businesses. The e-commerce giant also laid off dozens of workers in its communications department to help the company ""move faster, increase ownership, strengthen culture, and bring teams closer to customers."" These cuts are part of Amazon's broader cost-reduction strategy, having reduced its workforce by approximately 27,000 employees since the start of 2022.Jeff Bezos's space company Blue Origin laid off about 10% of its workforce, affecting more than 1,000 employees in what represents a significant reduction in the commercial space industry. CEO David Limp said the company's priority was ""to scale manufacturing output and launch cadence with speed, decisiveness and efficiency for customers."" The layoffs particularly targeted roles in engineering, research and development, and management positions. Limp acknowledged that rapid growth in recent years had created ""more bureaucracy and less focus than needed,"" necessitating organizational changes to align with execution priorities.Cloud-based customer management software company Salesforce cut more than 1,000 jobs from its nearly 73,000-strong workforce, despite reporting strong financial performance during its third-quarter earnings. The cuts come as the company actively recruits and hires workers to sell new AI products, indicating a strategic shift rather than financial distress. Affected employees are eligible to apply for open internal roles, particularly in sales positions focused on Salesforce's artificial intelligence-powered products.Human resources software company Workday cut 8.5% of its workforce, eliminating around 1,750 employees as part of a strategic focus on artificial intelligence development. CEO Carl Eschenbach said the company would concentrate hiring in AI-related areas while expanding its global presence. The layoffs came with severance packages of at least 12 weeks of pay for affected employees. Eschenbach emphasized that ""the environment we're operating in today demands a new approach, particularly given our size and scale.""Japanese automaker Nissan announced the most severe cuts in the automotive sector, planning to eliminate 20,000 jobs by 2027 while reducing its factory operations from 17 to 10 facilities. The job losses include 9,000 layoffs announced late last year and come as the automaker faces challenges from US tariffs on imported vehicles and collapsing sales in China. Nissan reported a net loss of 671 billion yen ($4.5 billion) for the 2024 financial year and declined to issue an operating profit forecast for 2025 due to tariff uncertainty.Jack Dorsey's fintech company Block laid off nearly 1,000 employees in its second major workforce reduction in just over a year. The company, which operates Square, Afterpay, CashApp, and Tidal, eliminated 931 positions representing around 8% of its workforce. The restructuring involved transitioning nearly 200 managers into non-management roles and closing almost 800 open positions. Dorsey announced the layoffs in an internal email titled ""smaller block,"" emphasizing that the changes were not driven by financial targets or AI replacements but were part of streamlining operations.General Motors' autonomous vehicle subsidiary Cruise laid off 50% of its workforce as it prepared to shut down operations entirely. The cuts included CEO Marc Whitten and several other top executives, with the remaining portions of the company moving under General Motors' direct control. The dramatic reduction represents one of the most significant failures in the autonomous vehicle sector, eliminating hundreds of jobs as the company ceased its independent operations.Coffee giant Starbucks eliminated 1,100 corporate employees as part of a comprehensive restructuring effort led by CEO Brian Niccol. The layoffs specifically targeted corporate staff and did not affect employees working in Starbucks stores. Niccol stated in a memo that the cuts would help Starbucks ""operate more efficiently, increase accountability, reduce complexity and drive better integration."" The company implemented the layoffs to improve results after sales declined in the previous year.Cybersecurity company CrowdStrike cut approximately 500 jobs, representing 5% of its global workforce of just over 10,000 employees. CEO George Kurtz said the Austin, Texas-based company's job cuts would position it ""to move faster, operate more efficiently, and continue cybersecurity leadership."" The layoffs came as CrowdStrike works to recover from a major software bug that temporarily disabled millions of Windows PCs worldwide, costing the company between $36 million and $53 million in restructuring expenses.Match Group, owner of Tinder and Hinge, announced it would cut 13% of its approximately 2,500 full-time workers, eliminating around 325 positions. New CEO Spencer Rascoff implemented the cuts while addressing challenges in the dating app market, particularly with younger generations souring on dating platforms. The restructuring aims to remove one out of every five managers and focus on ""product velocity"" to drive growth, with Rascoff acknowledging that apps ""have felt like a numbers game rather than a place to build real connections.""Automattic, the parent company of Tumblr and WordPress, eliminated 16% of its nearly 1,500-person global workforce. CEO Matt Mullenweg said the company had reached an ""important crossroads"" with revenue growth occurring in a highly competitive market where ""technology is evolving at unprecedented levels."" The restructuring aimed to improve ""productivity, profitability, and capacity to invest"" while the company offered severance and job placement resources to affected employees.German luxury automaker Porsche announced plans to cut 3,900 jobs over the coming years as part of efficiency improvements. About 2,000 of the reductions will come from the expiration of fixed-term contractor positions, while the company will make the remaining 1,900 cuts by 2029 through natural attrition and limited hiring. Porsche said the changes would ""make Porsche even more efficient in the medium and long term"" while discussing additional potential changes with labor leaders.","Intel plans 21,000+ job cuts in largest tech layoff in its history.
