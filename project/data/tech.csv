""Investment of Rs 4,000 crore, half a billion dollars alone, has resulted in sales of Rs 80,000 crore, Rs 16,000 crore in exports, (and) 25,000 jobs being created.

Saquon Barkley net worth 2025 and his current salary



Saquon Barkley investments



Saquon Barkley has never been just another running back. Ever since entering the NFL as the No. 2 overall pick in 2018, Barkley has consistently delivered electrifying performances that make him a true standout. From his early accolades—being named both Rookie of the Year and a Pro Bowler—to his unexpected switch from the Giants to the Eagles in 2024, his journey has kept fans glued to the screen.Now with the Eagles, Barkley continues to redefine his position. In a historic November game, he shattered the franchise record with 255 rushing yards and 302 total yards, proving once again that he can single-handedly turn the tide. Off the field, his financial acumen has mirrored his on-field success, solidifying him as not just a player—but a brand.Saquon Barkley’s 2025 has become a defining chapter in his already stellar NFL career. With an estimated net worth of $32 million, as reported by Forbes, Marca, and Pro Football Network , Barkley’s financial journey mirrors his dominance on the field. A substantial portion of his wealth stems from his NFL contracts, which have now placed him in a league of his own.Initially, Barkley joined the Philadelphia Eagles in March 2024 on a three-year, $37.75 million deal, leaving behind his tenure with the New York Giants. That deal guaranteed $26 million and an annual salary of $12 million. But what followed in the 2024–2025 season was nothing short of extraordinary.Leading the league with 2,005 rushing yards in the regular season, Barkley powered the Eagles to a triumphant Super Bowl LIX win. On March 4, 2025, his excellence was rewarded with a two-year, $41.2 million extension. As reported by CBS Sports, this new deal includes $36 million guaranteed and can reach an additional $15 million through incentives—making Barkley the highest-paid running back in NFL history with an average annual salary of $20.6 million.“Barkley earned $250,000 in incentives for surpassing 1,000 rushing yards and helping Philly win the NFC Championship,” noted CBS Sports contributor Joel Corry. That bonus will also elevate his base salary by $250,000 in both 2025 and 2026.With elite performance, unmatched dedication, and savvy contract moves, Barkley continues to redefine what success looks like for an NFL running back—on and off the gridiron.Saquon Barkley is not just a force on the field—he’s equally strategic when it comes to his money. From early in his career, Barkley made it clear that he wasn't just thinking about short-term gains but planning for long-term stability. “I’m going to invest my money and live off the endorsement deals,” he had shared in 2018, even before signing with the New York Giants, taking a cue from athletes like Marshawn Lynch.That vision has materialized impressively. Barkley has invested in sectors he believes in, including consumer goods and agriculture. One of his standout moves came in 2021 when he backed X2 PERFORMANCE with $16 million. The brand, known for its clean energy supplements, aligns with his athlete-first philosophy. His endorsement portfolio—featuring giants like Nike, Visa, Pepsi, Dunkin' Donuts, and Toyota—is reportedly worth $10 million. His recent Unisom commercial, where he lightheartedly trolled the Giants, reflects both his business savvy and his playful personality.Beyond brand partnerships, Barkley’s financial discipline extends into real estate. In 2018, he bought a $424,500 home in Whitehall, Pennsylvania, as a heartfelt gift to his parents—one of his earliest dreams fulfilled. That property's value has since appreciated to around $650,000. He also owns a $3.5 million luxury penthouse in Jersey City, boasting sweeping Manhattan views and upscale amenities—a symbol of his refined urban lifestyle.Barkley’s evolving investment journey, including forays into cryptocurrency, underscores his proactive approach to wealth. It’s clear he’s not just securing his future—he’s building it brick by brick.Also Read: NFL stars light up the 2025 Met Gala with Joe Burrow, Justin Jefferson and Saquon Barkley stealing the show","Saquon barkley is the highest-paid running back in nfl history with an average annual salary of $20.6 million.

REAL ID deadline hits May 7: TSA to enforce new airport rules



How and where to get a REAL ID



In-person applications

REAL ID applications must typically be completed in person. Applicants must bring:

Proof of identity (e.g., birth certificate or passport)

Proof of Social Security number

Two proofs of residency (e.g., utility bill, lease agreement)

As the May 7, 2025, deadline for REAL ID enforcement approaches, millions of Americans are rushing to obtain compliant identification cards. The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will soon require travelers to present a REAL ID or other federally accepted identification at airport security checkpoints. However, this urgency has triggered a sharp rise in online scams designed to exploit consumers. From fake websites to phishing texts and misleading social media posts, fraudsters are targeting those who may be unfamiliar with the application process or anxious about the impending deadline. These fraudulent schemes aim to steal personal and financial data under the guise of providing expedited REAL ID services.Cybercriminals have launched a variety of fake websites that mimic state DMV portals. These sites request sensitive personal data under the pretense of processing REAL ID applications. Some also charge illegitimate processing fees or redirect users to malicious links.Spoofed emails often accompany these scams. They may contain official-looking logos and language to appear legitimate, asking recipients to “verify” their identity or “complete” their application with a payment of around $35 for so-called “expedited” processing.Phishing text messages have also emerged, with messages instructing users to click on links to apply for or confirm their REAL ID. These messages typically contain shortened URLs and pressure language like “Immediate Action Required.”On social media platforms, scammers have posted advertisements or comments promoting fake REAL ID services. Some link directly to phishing websites, while others encourage users to call fake customer support lines.Consumers should be aware of several red flags when navigating REAL ID applications:If you receive a suspicious message or visit a questionable website:To apply for a REAL ID, individuals should go directly to their state DMV's official website. Each site has a dedicated section for REAL ID information, application instructions, documentation checklists, and online scheduling tools.In the event that personal data has been compromised, individuals are encouraged to place a credit freeze with the three major credit bureaus: Experian, TransUnion, and Equifax. This prevents any new credit accounts from being opened in their name.Anyone who believes their identity has been stolen should visit identitytheft.gov. This federal resource walks users through the steps of creating a recovery plan and filing reports with the appropriate agencies.Regularly checking bank and credit card statements can help detect fraudulent activity early. Setting up transaction alerts is also recommended.The REAL ID Act was passed by Congress in 2005 in response to security concerns following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It establishes minimum security standards for the issuance of state-issued driver’s licenses and identification cards. A REAL ID-compliant card will be required to:REAL IDs are marked with a star at the top of the card. They are issued by state Department of Motor Vehicles (DMVs), but adhere to federal guidelines set by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS).After multiple postponements, the TSA will begin enforcing the REAL ID requirement on May 7, 2025. Travelers who do not have a REAL ID or another form of approved identification (such as a U.S. passport) will not be permitted to pass through airport security checkpoints for domestic travel.Due to this imminent enforcement date, DMVs across the country have experienced a surge in applications. In Virginia, for example, the Department of Motor Vehicles reported that REAL ID cards accounted for 61% of all active licenses as of April 2025. A total of 166,816 REAL ID cards were issued in Virginia that month alone—a 60% increase compared to March 2025.Many DMVs offer walk-in service as well as online appointment booking. Some also provide virtual ticketing systems where users can reserve a spot in line remotely.","The may 7, 2025, deadline for real id enforcement approaches.

What happens to existing users?



Chats & Contacts: Users can log into Microsoft Teams with their Skype credentials, ensuring a seamless transition with all previous messages and contacts intact.

Paid Services: New purchases of Skype Credit and subscriptions have been halted, but existing users can continue using their plans until their billing cycle ends.

Skype Numbers: These will remain active until expiry and can be ported to other carriers. Calls to Skype Numbers will still be received via Teams

How to get started with Teams for free

Download Teams on your device from the official Microsoft Teams website. Log in with your Skype credentials. Start using Teams with all your Skype chats and contacts ready to go.





Skype is now part of a series of Microsoft projects that have not met expectations, alongside Internet Explorer and Windows Phone. Other tech companies have also faced challenges with online communication tools, with Google making several attempts through apps like Hangouts and Duo.



When Microsoft acquired Skype in 2011 for $8.5 billion, outbidding Google and Facebook, the service had around 150 million monthly users. By 2020, that number had declined to roughly 23 million, even with a brief increase during the pandemic.



Earlier this year, Microsoft announced that it will shut down its Skype video conferencing service today (May 5). “In order to streamline our free consumer communications offerings so we can more easily adapt to customer needs, we will be retiring Skype in May 2025 to focus on Microsoft Teams (free), our modern communications and collaboration hub,” said Microsoft in a blog post. The company is encouraging both free and paid Skype users to migrate to the Teams platform, which offers similar communication and collaboration features. Notably, this change does not affect Skype for Business users . Microsoft has also allowed the Skype users to sign into Teams on any supported device using their Skype credentials.Microsoft launched Skype on 2003 for easier online communication. However, with the platform lost its relevance with rise of new platforms such as Zoom, Google Meet and more. Microsoft’s decision to retire Skype is part of a broader strategy to streamline its communication services and focus on Teams, which offers enhanced collaboration tools for both personal and professional use.Microsoft has already stopped allowing new purchases of Skype Subscriptions, Skype Numbers, and Skype Credit, signaling the gradual phasing out of the platform.Moving to Teams is simple and doesn’t prevent you from also continuing to use Skype during the transition period.Here’s how to get started:","Microsoft has announced that it will shut down its skype video conferencing service today (may 5) the company is encouraging both free and paid skype users to migrate to the teams platform, which offers similar communication and collaboration features.

Business impact – inflection point

Rajesh Nambiar, President, NASSCOM

Ecosystem collaboration

We have often said on these pages, GCCs or global capability centres – the tech and operations arms of MNCs – are one of the best things happening for India right now. They bring lots of jobs, many of them high-quality jobs, they transfer a lot of tech skills to Indians that then enable local high-tech entrepreneurship, they raise the bar on compensation, they set up world-class office facilities, many work with our educational institutions to upgrade syllabi and collaborate on R&D, and some of them are beginning to move into our smaller cities, dispersing the growth process.Now, how do we see this trend going forward? What will it take to accelerate the trend? These were some questions we discussed with a panel of leaders at the Nasscom GCC Summit in Hyderabad last month.But before that, we also discussed how we got here. As Sangeeta Kumar, MD & CEO of BNP Paribas India Solutions, said, India built trust with global corporate leaders over a long period through sheer execution excellence – delivering projects without errors, on time, without data loss. “There are a lot of controls and processes in which India teams have done really well. So anything that gets sent to India is delivered much better than it was being done elsewhere globally,” she said.Rajesh Nambiar, president of Nasscom, noted that Indian IT services providers, and early GCCs like those of GE and American Express also played a phenomenal role in setting these standards, with practices like Six Sigma and Lean.Jaideep Agarwal, India GBS leader for Warner Brothers, who had worked at American Express in its early days here, noted that there were no Bibles called standard operating procedures or workflows when work first came to India. Developing the fundamentals of process excellence, he said, took time – they had to take employees through the journey of ₹think process’, ₹think failure modes’.This accomplishment increased the influence that Indian teams had over global leaders. And that allowed them, over time, to take on bigger global roles, leadership roles, and, increasingly now, take on projects that have a business impact.That revenue impact, Nambiar noted, is the inflection point for a GCC. The biggest benefit to a GCC, he said, comes when it crosses the threshold from being part of the cost equation to a revenue equation. “If you’re a CFO sitting in New York and you’re looking at some of this, it’s a no brainer. But the moment you get the attention of the CEO looking at the business side and saying that, you know, this is not just an outpost that you want to leverage from a labour and cost point of view, but this is an outpost where you want to truly leverage the talent, the expertise and truly integrate it with what the corporation is trying to do and provide a better value proposition to the end customers (then you get into a different trajectory),” he said.That’s indeed what the more mature GCCs are doing today. Naveen Gullapalli, who leads US biopharmaceutical company Amgen’s India technology and innovation centre, noted that the centre was set up as part of an enterprise scale exercise, to bring in talent at scale. “Amgen is looking to serve double the number of patients that we’re serving. And the way to serve that is through scale across our functions,” he said.Agarwal said the rollout of Warner Bros’ Max streaming platform was the big reason for establishing the Hyderabad centre. The centre helped build the platform and is helping roll it out. “We are in 77 countries and we hope to be in every single territory or every single geography in the world. And that’s where we see our Hyderabad office playing a pivotal role, in accelerating that. And that’s the impact we are making from a revenue standpoint, because the faster we are able to roll out, the faster those markets are able to come on board, and faster those subscribers can view our content,” he said.Sangeeta noted that GCCs are today being leveraged to mine the massive amounts of data available to understand industry and customer trends, and thereby make critical front-end contributions. She also said that across insurance, banking and investment, mediumscale firms too are now pivoting to India, having seen the success of the large institutions.Everyone also noted that the ecosystem has been hugely collaborative, helping each other grow. Agarwal noted that Gullapalli had hosted Warner Bros’ leadership team some three or four times to help them understand the opportunities in India.Nambiar noted the role Nasscom plays, and said cross-sectoral GCC collaborations could be useful in dealing with common issues like transfer pricing and upgrading skills.","Gccs or global capability centres are one of the best things happening for india right now.

AI central to transformation

Frank Tarsillo

Delhi NCR is at the heart of S&P Global, the $14-billion data, research and analytics firm. The Manhattan, New York, headquartered company’s key technology operations for thousands of global customers are handled by teams in India. S&P Global has around 15,000 employees in India, more than a third of its global strength, with 5,500 in Gurugram and Noida. The company says India manages more than 300 products and serves clients in financial services , oil & gas, mobility, automobiles, energy and beyond.Frank Tarsillo, CTO of S&P Global Market Intelligence, and his colleague, Dan Bennett, head of technology for S&P Global Enterprise Data Organisation at S&P Global, were in Delhi-NCR recently to oversee delivery operations and expansion activity. That expansion includes a third office in Gurugram to support global clients. “The majority of our product development, especially in market intelligence, happens in Delhi NCR – from premium desktop offerings like CapIQ Pro (a data and analytics platform) to software that supports clients’ workflows,” Tarsillo told us.Teams here handle tasks spanning engineering and data modeling to product design and client support – empowering global industries with data transformed into actionable intelligence.In the energy space, engineers in Delhi NCR build and maintain modeling software used by oil & gas companies for subsurface exploration. Teams here manage global credit ratings, they support automotive supply chains and energy transition analysis. They help global clients analyse sectors and trends, manage risk, and make decisions around maritime, trade, economics and country risk.Tarsillo says the expanded office in Gurugram is to keep people together and foster collaboration. “Gurugram has consistently offered us access to great talent and scale. It’s the cornerstone of our global strategy,” he says.AI has been a key driver of S&P Global’s transformation. The company’s 40,000 employees use Spark Assist, a proprietary AI assistant whose core engineering team, including its head of engineering, is based out of India. Initially built with GPT models, Spark Assist now supports multiple models like Claude and DeepSeek and has become a go-to tool across functions — from summarising meetings to generating code suggestions.“The uptake (of Spark Assist) was organic,” says Tarsillo. “People started using it to get answers faster, summarise documents, and even route customer service requests intelligently. We saw engineering productivity rise by 10–12% within three months of adoption. More impressively, junior engineers began performing at levels two notches above their experience.”Spark Assist allows employees to create reusable prompt libraries, share workflows and build task-oriented agents. Integrated into tools like Excel and Office 365, it is fast becoming the backbone of S&P’s knowledge-sharing culture. The platform also plays a critical role in document intelligence. For instance, in CapIQ Pro, users can now instantly access summarised insights, sentiment analysis and even suggested questions based on corporate earnings transcripts – without reading through entire documents.“What excites me is not just efficiency but insight,” says Tarsillo. “We’re moving into a space where AI tells you what questions to ask — what you might have missed. That’s game-changing.”But AI can hallucinate, cautions Bennett. “That’s why structured, semantically rich data is crucial. We’re investing in better data governance and semantic layers to ensure AI makes quality decisions,” he says.Going forward, S&P is betting big on AI-driven growth. “More efficiency means more capacity – and that lets us tackle harder problems we couldn’t before,” says Tarsillo.","S&p global has around 15,000 employees in india, more than a third of its global strength.

Bangladesh Currency Crisis: Bangladesh faces currency crisis as central bank halts issuing notes featuring Mujibur Rahman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-faces-currency-crisis-as-central-bank-halts-issuing-notes-featuring-mujibur-rahman/articleshow/120714882.cms,"Approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused

DHAKA: The central bank of Bangladesh has apparently incurred a huge financial loss due to the interim govt’s decision not to issue previously printed notes, with approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remaining unused. The decision aligns with govt’s efforts to diminish Bangabandhu’s presence in public memory.Although bank officials are unwilling to discuss the matter publicly, many, on conditions of anonymity, said the longstanding tradition of obtaining new notes from Bangladesh Bank has been abruptly halted, creating a crisis in the market. On the one hand, the printed money is being wasted without use; on the other hand, customers are suffering as a result, they added.“Notes of various denominations are printed using paper and ink purchased with people’s taxes. Millions of notes with Bangabandhu’s picture are still lying in the vaults of various banks. The Security Printing Corporation does not have the capacity to cancel all the notes at once and print new ones. Therefore, notes with Bangabandhu’s picture cann’t be suddenly cancelled,” Ziauddin Ahmed, former executive director of Bangladesh Bank and former managing director of Security Printing Corporation, told reporters.In this situation, he suggested the printed notes be circulated in the market to alleviate public suffering. “When new design notes come into the market, the old ones should be gradually withdrawn. Generally, notes printed once can be used for a maximum of four to five years,” Ahmed said.According to media reports, Bangladesh Bank is unable to issue new notes to banks in line with demand. The crisis became evident following the country’s political upheaval in Aug last year.Since all forms of currency, including metal coins, feature Mujibur’s image, Bangladesh Bank abruptly stopped issuing new notes early April. As a result, the notes featuring Bangabandhu’s image are not reaching the market. Shops, banks, and citizens are now left with torn and old, dirty notes.According to sources at Bangladesh Bank, the Security Printing Corporation is set to begin printing new design notes next month. In the first phase, new design notes of 20, 50, and 1,000 taka will be printed and subsequently released in the market through banks.","Approximately taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused.

How speaking multiple languages changes your brain,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/how-speaking-multiple-languages-changes-your-brain/articleshow/120928666.cms,"AP file photo

Language areas of the brain

Learning a new language physically changes the brain

Learning languages as a child is an advantage

Does learning a language make you smarter?





There are many reasons to learn a new language , it might be for work, a love interest, or a personal interest in a region's culture or people.Research shows that learning languages benefits your overall brain health too.Learning a new language is like working out your brain. Just as muscles get stronger with physical training, neural pathways in the brain reshape when you learn a new language.That's what neuroscientists mean when they say people who speak multiple languages process information differently than those who speak one language. But what really happens in the brain when you learn a new language, and does it make you smarter?Before we get to those questions, here are some basics about how language requires many different parts of the brain.Language processing involves two key circuits, one for perceiving and producing sound, which forms the foundation of language, and another for selecting which language's sounds to use, said Arturo Hernandez , a neuroscientist at University of California San Diego , US.""These circuits are rewired as we learn and switch between languages. It's about mapping sounds and deciding which language to operate in,"" Hernandez told DW.We need sensory areas like the auditory cortex to process speech sounds, and we need the brain's expansive motor networks to coordinate the muscles involved in speech, such as those for controlling the tongue, lips and vocal cords.This is true for all languages, but changes in 'higher processing' areas of the brain are needed to learn a new language.For example, the Broca's area located in the frontal lobe is primarily responsible for syntax — the way we structure sentences. It helps construct grammatically correct sentences and understand sentence structure.The Broca's area is also key for speech production and facilitates the motor control needed for articulating words.Other brain regions like Wernicke's area play an important role in vocabulary comprehension and word retrieval. It helps in understanding the meaning of words and storing them in long-term memory.A German study in 2024 measured the brain activity of Syrian refugees before, during, and after they learned the German language.It found that people's brains rewired as they became more proficient in German.'Brain rewiring' means that the brain's neuronal structures physically changed. This process — called neuroplasticity — is the mechanism which underlies learning.Learning a new language therefore required new ways for the participants' brains to encode, store, and retrieve new linguistic information.""Structurally, [learning a language] increases gray matter structure in areas related to language processing and executive function,"" said Jennifer Wittmeyer, a cognitive neuroscientist at Elizabethtown College in Pennsylvania, US.Structural changes in the brain also change the way the brain functions as it physically changes the way neurons communicate. This so-called 'neural plasticity' helps you remember words faster, recognize new sounds better and improve pronunciation by controlling your mouth muscles.""Functionally, [language learning] enhances connectivity between brain regions, allowing for more efficient communication between networks involved in attention, memory, and cognitive control,"" Wittmeyer told DW.Studies show that we use the same brain networks for all languages, but the brain responds differently to our native language. One study found that brain activity in language networks actually decreased when participants listened to their native language.This suggests the first language you acquire is processed differently in the brain with minimal effort, researchers say.Research also shows it's much easier for young children to learn new languages than it is for adults.Young children's brains are still in development and are more adaptable to neural plasticity and learning. Unlike adults, they don't have to translate from their first language, so they pick up sounds, grammar, and words more effortlessly.""At an early age there's not as much rigidity in the brain. Adult brains are already structured around their first language, so a second language must adapt to existing knowledge rather than develop independently as it relies on previously established neural networks,"" said Hernandez.Some research does show that multilingualism improves cognitive abilities like memory and problem-solving abilities. But does this mean polyglots are smarter?It's complicated, but probably not, said Hernandez.""If somebody speaks more than one language, it increases their verbal repertoire. They have more words across all languages, more items, necessarily more concepts,"" said Hernandez.But it's unclear if having a bigger vocabulary is due to a bigger cognitive reserve or just having more words stored in the brain's memory banks. And this isn't the same thing as intelligence.To really test if polyglots are more intelligent, scientists would need to ""find a task that's not related to language,"" said Hernandez.So far, the evidence isn't very clear that polyglots perform better in tasks which aren't related to languages.And scientists aren't sure if changes in cognitive skills in multilinguals are due to learning languages, or due to other factors like education or the environment they grew up in. There are too many factors involved in cognitive skills to isolate it to one factor like language learning, say researchers.But regardless of whether better cognitive skills equals smartness, it's clear that learning new languages opens up new cultural experiences in your life.","Research shows that learning languages benefits your overall brain health. Language processing involves two key circuits, one for perceiving and producing sound, and another for selecting which language's sounds to use. 'brain rewiring' means that the brain's neuronal structures physically changed.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120928718,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1112843,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
"Australia government to continue working on cutting net migration, hiking minimum pay for skilled workers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/australia-government-to-continue-working-on-cutting-net-migration-hiking-minimum-pay-for-skilled-workers/articleshow/120914450.cms,"



Australia's immigration policy under PM Anthony Albanese's Labour government will continue to prioritise skilled workers to meet market needs while curbing net migration. With the Labour Party's re-election, the country will continue on its path of reducing net-migration, increasing salary thresholds for skilled visa programmes, and raising visa fees for international students.The Indian diaspora is the second largest in Australia, with over 8.5 lakh Indian-born residents as of June 2023 - more than twice the number of 3.8 lakh as on June 30, 2013.However, tighter visa norms have seen annual visa allotments drop. In 2023-24, only 50,516 student visas were issued to Indian nationals, down from 1.02 lakh in the previous year. Similarly, the number of temporary skilled employment visas issued had dropped from 27,402 to 18,397.In Dec 2023, the Australian government announced that net migration will be halved within two years from a record high of 5.1 lakh by imposing tougher tests on international students and focusing on workers with high skills attuned to market needs. The net overseas migration numbers were projected to fall to 2,50,000 in 2024-25; followed by 2,55,000 in 2025-26 and 2,35,000 in 2026-27.Teresa Liu, managing partner (Australia & New Zealand) at Fragomen, a global immigration law firm, said, ""We expect the current set of reforms on the Skilled Visa Program and the migration strategy reform agenda to continue.The main takeaway for aspiring employees and indeed employers or Indian businesses doing business in Australia, is that from a policy perspective, it is largely business as usual. However, the more 'mundane' or expected changes in occupation lists and salary thresholds are expected to be announced in July. ""Last Dec, Australia introduced the 'Skills-in-demand' visa and replaced the earlier regime. This visa offers pathways for 'specialist', 'core', and 'essential' skills occupations. As part of ongoing reforms, salary thresholds for the core skills occupations will rise from AUD 73,150 to AUD 76,515, while the specialist skills income threshold will rise from AUD 135,000 to AUD 141,210. These changes will impact employers and prospective employees, requiring them to plan ahead, added Liu.Last year, the Australia government failed in its earlier attempt to cap student intake, however, an increase in visa fees come July seems imminent. The current fee of AUD 1,600 was set in July 2024, which was a 125% increase from the previous fee of AUD 710. Their revised outlook includes a plan to increase the application fee for an Australian study visa by AUD 400 to stand at AUD 2,000.","The indian diaspora is the second largest in australia, with over 8.5 lakh indian-born residents.

Investors holding the Sovereign Gold Bond (SGB) 2017-18 Series VI, issued on November 6, 2017, will be eligible for premature redemption on May 6, 2025, at a price of Rs 9,453 per gram, as notified by the Reserve Bank of India.This marks a gain of around 221% on the original issue price of Rs 2,945 per gram (or Rs 2,895 for investors), over a holding period of seven and a half years.In an official statement on Monday, the RBI said, “The redemption price for premature redemption due on May 06, 2025 shall be Rs 9,453/- (Rupees Nine Thousand Four Hundred and Fifty-Three only) per unit of SGB based on the simple average of closing gold price for the three business days i.e., April 30, May 02 and May 05, 2025.”According to the RBI the Sovereign Gold Bond 2017-18 Series VI was priced at Rs 2,945 per gram, based on the average closing price of gold of 999 purity from October 25 to 27, 2017. Investors who applied online and paid digitally had received a Rs 50 discount, bringing the effective issue price to Rs 2,895 per gram.The Sovereign Gold Bond Scheme was launched in 2015 by the Government of India, in consultation with the RBI, as a financial alternative to physical gold investment.Bonds are issued in denominations of one gram of gold or multiples thereof, and are tradable and eligible for conversion to dematerialised form. Each tranche is open for limited subscription windows and comes with a fixed interest rate of 2.50% per annum, paid semi-annually.A key advantage for individual investors is the exemption from capital gains tax upon redemption.Speaking about the tax implications, Shalini Jain, Tax Partner at EY India, clarified “Sovereign Gold Bonds (‘SGB’) issued by the Reserve Bank of India and subsequently redeemed by the individuals do not attract any capital gains taxation. The tenure of SGBs is typically eight years, however, early encashment is permitted after the fifth year from the date of issue of such SGBs. This early encashment may also be regarded as redemption which is explicitly excluded from capital gains tax. ”She further added that while individual investors enjoy this benefit, HUFs and other entities are not covered under this exemption.“The relevant beneficial provisions of the Income-tax Act, 1961 specifically covers ‘redemption’ of SGB for individuals and does not include HUF and other entities. For HUFs and other entities, redemption of SGB will be liable to normal capital gains taxation,” Shalini Jain added.Redemption of SGBs is allowed only after the fifth year, and only on the interest payment dates. While the bonds have an eight-year maturity, this early exit option offers investors flexibility, especially in a rising gold market. The bonds can also be used as collateral for loans.","Sovereign gold bond (sgb) 2017-18 series vi, issued on november 6, 2017, will be eligible for premature redemption on may 6, 2025.
