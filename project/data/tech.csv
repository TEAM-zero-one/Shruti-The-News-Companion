CAFE 3 showdown: Carmakers clash as Maruti–Toyota push for new 'mini-car' category for availing emissions leniency,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cafe-3-showdown-carmakers-clash-as-marutitoyota-push-for-new-mini-car-category-for-availing-emissions-leniency/articleshow/125875077.cms,"NEW DELHI: It’s a straight fight between the Japanese power duo of Maruti Suzuki-Toyota who are pitted against the might of the rest of the car industry over the soon-to-be-announced CAFE 3 emission norms.A large section of India’s car industry huddled in a meeting with Road Transport and Highways Minister Nitin Gadkari on Monday, sans Maruti, Toyota Kirloskar, and French Renault, as they “complained” about the aggressive charge spearheaded by the Japanese companies to push for creation of an all-new mini car category that will have vehicles under the weight of 909 kgs.The hush-hush meeting with Gadkari, late on Monday evening, was attended by a bevy of Indian and multinational carmakers that included local heavyweights Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra, apart from the Korean siblings Hyundai and Kia, as well as JSW MG Motor.Ahead of the announcement of a final regulation on the new CAFE3 emission norms that will lay the roadmap for industry emissions from April 2027, the companies are “worried” that creation of a new light-weight mini segment — where 95% of vehicles are from the Maruti stable — will lead to having “architecturally unsafe cars” on the Indian roads while also disrupting their investment and new products plans, sources in the know told TOI.“This will be an aberration and will lead to creation of a completely unsafe car category as none of the existing vehicles in this so-called light-weight category have received adequate safety ratings by global agencies. Also, what is the logic of giving an easier emission target to this special category which unfairly benefits only one particular company,” the company representatives said in the meeting with Gadkari.Questions sent to Maruti Suzuki did not elicit a response.The joint representation of the companies said that any change in India’s vehicle classification rules, especially based on weight, will only end up disturbing their product and investment plans. “Our investment plans will be disrupted if the govt creates a new mini category on the lines of weight of a vehicle against the currently well-defined vehicle class of small cars,” the companies told the Minister.Currently, the lowest rung in car classification is made of “small cars” which are vehicles that are under 4 meters in length and have petrol engines below 1200cc and diesel under 1500cc. “This is the classification which is also used for GST purposes, and we are building our investments and plans based on this. What is the need for creating an all-new ‘random’ light-weight category of 909 kgs and below which doesn’t exist anywhere else across the world. ”The Minister told the companies to submit a representation on the matter even as the players have approached other ministries, including the Ministry of Heavy Industries, as well as the Ministry of Power.",A large section of india’s car industry huddled in a meeting with road transport and highways minister nitin gadkari on monday.

Shohei Ohtani vs Juan Soto: Who really has the highest net worth in 2025?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/shohei-ohtani-vs-juan-soto-who-really-has-the-highest-net-worth-in-2025/articleshow/125861466.cms,"Shohei Ohtani and Juan Soto (Image via: IG/X)

Shohei Ohtani is currently richer because of his growing net worth and massive endorsement income



Juan Soto becomes the highest yearly earner because he bet on himself and won the biggest contract

Shohei Ohtani and Juan Soto now headline baseball’s richest rivalry as their careers reshape how modern athletes earn and protect wealth. Ohtani is a Japanese megastar with an estimated net worth of 150 million dollars while Soto is a Dominican standout worth about 100 million dollars. Their new contracts changed the market yet their money flows differently which makes their comparison fascinating. One earns later through planning and global deals while the other takes home record money today.Ohtani rose in Japan as a two way star before joining MLB while Soto became a World Series hero at a young age. Both became must watch players but their financial paths were shaped by different choices. Ohtani signed a 10 year 700 million dollar deal with the Dodgers but gets only 2 million dollars over that span before the real money arrives from 2034. Soto signed a 15 year 765 million dollar deal with the Mets that pays him 51 million dollars yearly with no delays.Ohtani reached MLB with star status already built which helped him earn brands fast even when his salary was low. Between 2018 and 2022 he earned under 10 million dollars from baseball which is small compared to his value. His one year 30 million dollar deal in 2023 pushed him toward free agency and his record Dodgers deal followed soon after.His deferred plan gives security for later years while endorsements between 40 and 50 million dollars yearly build his wealth now.Ohtani is rare because he makes more away from baseball than on the field due to his worldwide following. His success in Japan and America made him a marketing face that few athletes ever reach. That combination lets him collect steady money today and huge checks in the future. His journey shows how fame plus patience can deliver long term financial power.Soto built his profile with confidence and production which earned the nickname “Childish Bambino”. He rejected a 13 year 350 million dollar offer and later turned down a 15 year 440 million dollar extension which shocked many. Those decisions led him to the largest baseball deal ever at 765 million dollars. From 2015 to 2024 he already earned 82 million dollars which added to his foundation.His contract with the Mets pays him now instead of later which makes him the richest player yearly in baseball today. His rise shows how the right gamble at the right time can change a career path. Soto proved that young stars can shape their own value instead of accepting early deals. His path gives the next generation a guide on how to chase true market worth.Ohtani and Soto are elite players who became the faces of baseball’s money era through different tactics. One built a brand empire while the other maximized guaranteed salary. Both approaches worked and changed how the sport sees contracts and long term planning.

Charlie’s Snapchat check raises concerns for Twitch and other streaming platforms





Australia has started enforcing a world-first rule that stops kids under 16 from using major social media and streaming platforms. This includes apps like Snapchat, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, Twitch and other streaming sites. The goal is simple: keep kids safer online. But even before the ban fully takes effect, teens are already finding ways around the system.Some kids are using fake birth dates. Others are testing selfie checks. And in one strange case shared online, users said they uploaded photos of dogs, including a golden retriever, to age-check systems, and the system still approved them as adults. These stories are raising big questions about how strong and reliable these age checks really are, especially for live streaming platforms where kids spend hours watching and chatting.The issue became very real after Guardian Australia reported on a 15-year-old Sydney boy, called Charlie to protect his identity. Last week, Charlie got a message from Snapchat saying he needed to prove his age to keep using the app because of the new ban. Even though his account used an old birth date that made him look over 16, Snapchat still asked for a check.Charlie chose the selfie option. He took a photo of his face, sent it in, and passed.Seconds later, he got a message saying, “Thank you, we won’t bother you any more.” Charlie said he was shocked it worked so easily.Charlie’s mother, Christine, told Guardian Australia she now wants to report her own child’s account. She questioned how a computer system can really tell the difference between a 15-year-old and a 16-year-old. “It just feels like we’re not going to win,” she said, adding she still hopes the new law helps families in the long run.Snapchat later said it has warned the government about how hard it is to fully block under-age users using current technology. A company spokesperson explained that better age checks might work at phone, device or app-store level. Snapchat also said parents can report accounts they believe belong to under-age children.Meanwhile, teens are still active on other platforms. Charlie said he uses Instagram, TikTok and streaming apps but has not been asked to verify his age there yet. That worries experts, because platforms like Twitch and other live streaming sites often have fewer checks and fast-moving chats.In an opinion piece for News Corp, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the ban will not be perfect. But he stressed the message matters. Just like drinking laws, he said, rules still help even if some teens find ways to break them.For now, kids, parents, and tech companies are locked in a game of catch-up, and the ban’s real test is only just beginning.Also Read: Influencer Jeri Wirtz Of Jeri And Mike TikTok Fame Dies At 74 After Nine Year Cancer Fight","Australia has started enforcing a world-first rule that stops kids under 16 from using major social media and streaming platforms.

Owens argues the organization rushed leadership during profound grief, potentially placing Erika in an overwhelming role. She suggests an interim CEO would have been a more appropriate transition, allowing time for healing and reassessment.

Candace Owens Explodes; Claims Tpusa Staffer Hid Charlie Kirk’s ‘Death Text’

Candace Owens argues TPUSA blurred grief with leadership and mishandled a sensitive transition





Turning Point USA has been in the spotlight ever since the tragic assassination of Charlie Kirk in September 2025, but the controversy isn’t limited to the late conservative figure’s death. His widow, Erika Kirk, stepped into his CEO role just days after the tragedy, a decision that political commentator Candace Owens believes was rushed and mishandled.During a recent discussion with Russell Brand, Owens questioned whether the organization made the right leadership choice amid profound grief and chaos. Russell Brand uploaded the exchange on December 9, quoting Owens’ blunt reaction: “I think they made a managerial error.” What followed was Owens’ sharp critique of Erika’s abrupt appointment and how it may have set TPUSA up for deeper turmoil.According to Owens, the decision to elevate Erika so quickly placed someone who was still processing trauma into a spotlight she didn’t freely choose. Owens suggested that Erika might be facing either “the greatest evil that ever happened” or simply “terrified” to suddenly be leading an established conservative powerhouse.She warned that the organization’s rush created a situation where Erika was expected to defend TPUSA while still mourning. “She should never become the CEO and chairman overnight,” Owens said, adding that rapid promotion meant “now when people have questions, you got to answer them, right?”Owens argued that the organization should have installed an interim CEO. She insisted that “any company would do” this, allowing time to grieve and reassess rather than trying to mimic Charlie’s leadership style immediately. “You’re not just a grieving widow, but you very quickly decided that you were equipped to be Charlie,” she continued, calling Erika’s new role a “trial by fire.”The tension between Owens and TPUSA has only amplified due to a recent livestream dispute, in which Owens accused the organization of misleading her about timing and location. She further questioned why Erika was reportedly directing decisions behind the scenes, posting, “Did she approve of the letter Blake read?”Still, Owens maintained she is open to a transparent discussion, saying, “We can still make this work… and I would especially like to make this work if you are saying or implying that Erica Kirk is going to be there.”The debate now raises deeper questions: Was TPUSA honoring Charlie’s legacy, or rushing to contain its future? Candace Owens clearly believes the answer matters, now more than ever.Also Read: Candace Owens alleges Charlie Kirk predicted his own murder in message sent a day before his death","Candace owens criticizes turning point usa's swift appointment of erika kirk as ceo after charlie kirk's assassination.

William Karlsson’s NHL salary foundation and career growth

Emily Ferguson’s transition from television to media entrepreneurship

A growing shared fortune

One of the biggest pro sports and media power couples is William Karlsson and Emily Ferguson. Karlsson amassed his fortune over a long and fruitful NHL career, and Ferguson gathered all the fame from reality television into a durable and profitable digital empire. As a whole, the total wealth comes from player contracts, sponsorship contracts, and long-term brand partnerships. Working together exemplifies the way athletic stardom and media entrepreneurship help to mutually reinforce and broaden financial horizons.Their financial success continues to grow, fueled by Karlsson’s secure NHL earnings and Ferguson’s established influencer profile. With both maintaining strong visibility, the couple’s net worth reflects a dynamic and diversified income portfolio.The main source of Karlsson's fortune comes from his long-running NHL career that became stronger after the season in which Karlsson was alone at the top with the Vegas Golden Knights. He was rewarded with a league-wide recognition for his 43-goal campaign and shortly afterwards, he signed an eight-year, US$47.2 million contract, with a yearly average of almost US$5.9 million. This deal gives him financial security through the end of the 2026–27 season, which, together with his current income, represents the basis of his long-term earnings.Karlsson not only gets his base salary but also postseason compensation, performance bonuses, and probably endorsement deals arising from being a championship-quality player. Winning the 2023 Stanley Cup with the Golden Knights only enhanced Taylor's marketability, indirectly benefiting his long-term financial value. Given that you know he is going to be consistent on the ice, he is likely going to be earning big paychecks for the rest of his contract.Ferguson cultivated her own successful career after appearing on major reality television franchises, using that initial visibility to establish a strong social media following. Her platform now supports brand partnerships, lifestyle collaborations, sponsored content, and ongoing influencer marketing opportunities. While precise income figures are not publicly released, influencer revenue at her scale commonly produces substantial annual earnings.Balancing motherhood with a steady online presence, she continues to maintain audience engagement, which fuels recurring partnership deals. Her role in the public eye complements Karlsson’s athletic profile, creating a combined brand appeal that enhances opportunities for both.The streams of income through Karlsson and Ferguson, when combined, present a very stable and growing financial picture. The NHL contract exceeds US $47 million, while influencer revenue earns them a significant supplemental income bucket, bringing the couple's net worth comfortably into the multimillions. In the meantime, the couple will remain well-placed for added household benefit with Karlsson's career still taking its course along with Ferguson's media job on the rise, arguably, over the coming years.Also Read: Phillip Danault trade rumors: Elliotte Friedman weighs in on LA Kings center amid slow NHL season","William karlsson and emily ferguson are one of the biggest pro sports and media power couples.

Where Metaverse budget cuts may go

Wall Street says: We are with you on this

Meta reportedly delays MR glasses

The day Facebook changed its name to Meta





Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg seems to have finally realised that one of the company's biggest bets—Metaverse—is not working (or not working as expected). It is also the technology that the company changed its very name after. In 2021, after 17 years of being called Facebook, the social networking parent company behind Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus changed its name to Meta. Now according to a report from Bloomberg, Meta is likely to slash its Reality Labs budget, shaving off as much as 30%. The proposed metaverse cuts are reportedly part of the company's annual budget planning for 2026, which included a series of meetings at Zuckerberg's compound in Hawaii last month.For those unaware, Metaverse unit works on virtual reality headsets and a VR-based social network, which produces the company's Quest mixed-reality headsets, smart glasses made with EssilorLuxottica's Ray-Ban and upcoming augmented-reality glasses. Meta has struggled to sell its vision of an immersive metaverse of interconnected virtual worlds and expand the market for its devices beyond the niche of the gaming community.Analysts see the move reflecting the overall lack of interest in products like Meta’s social virtual reality platform Horizon Worlds, as well as its virtual reality hardware—both in the industry at large, as well as among consumers.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s Metaverse vision has posted more than $70 billion in losses over the past four years. Little doubt then that Facebook parent's shares rose 4% as the move eased some investor jitters over a bet that CEO Mark Zuckerberg has backed with billions of dollars. ""Smart move, just late,"" told Huber Research Partners analyst Craig Huber to Bloomberg. He added, ""This seems a major shift to align costs with a revenue outlook that surely is not as prosperous as management thought years ago. ""So, what may really be troubling Metaverse? No one can really pinpoint. But as a report in Fortune says, for many people, the problem is that the value proposition is unclear; Metaverse simply doesn’t yet deliver a must-have reason to ditch their smartphones or laptops.Reality Labs is made up of a Metaverse unit and a wearables unit. Within the Metaverse unit, executives are reportedly considering making cuts to VR jobs. As the report says, cuts in resources that high are most likely to include layoffs as early as January.The report comes as Meta scrambles to stay relevant in Silicon Valley's artificial-intelligence race after its Llama 4 model met with a poor reception. To fuel its ambitious goals, Meta has committed as much as $72 billion in capital spending this year. The company reorganized its AI efforts under Superintelligence Labs earlier this year, with Zuckerberg said to be personally leading an aggressive talent acquisition, floating offers for startups and directly courting prospects on WhatsApp with million-dollar pay packages. In fact, Meta's big hiring is said to have triggered a talent war in the Silicon Valley.Last month, Meta Platforms said that it will invest $600 billion in the US infrastructure and jobs over the next three years, including artificial intelligence data centers. Meta has doubled down on AI, with a target of achieving superintelligence. Zuckerberg said Meta is building compute because ""it's the right strategy to aggressively front-load capacity so we're prepared for the most optimistic cases,"" on the company's recent earnings call. Meta has forecast ""notably larger"" capital expenses next year thanks to investments in artificial intelligence, including aggressively building data centers to power its AI push.Incidentally, earlier this week, Zuckerberg announced that Alan Dye, a longtime designer at Apple, is joining Meta to lead a new creative studio inside the Reality Labs division that would focus on design, fashion and technology. Dye will report to Andrew Bosworth, Meta’s chief technology officer, who leads Reality Labs. “We’re entering a new era where A.I. glasses and other devices will change how we connect with technology and each other,” Mr. Zuckerberg said in a post to Threads. “With this new studio, we’re focused on making every interaction thoughtful, intuitive, and built to serve people.”Wall Street sent a clear signal to Meta Platforms that it wants the company to reduce spending on Reality Labs. Wall Street is sending a clear signal to Meta Platforms that it wants the company to reduce spending on Reality Labs. Meta Platforms shares jumped 3.4% on reports that the company was cutting Metaverse spending in favor of AI and smart glasses.Meta has reportedly delayed the launch of its Mixed Reality Glasses (MR Glasses) from the second half of 2026 to the first half of 2027. According to a report in Business Insider, Meta executives announced the delay after meetings with CEO Mark Zuckerberg is said to have told the team to take more time to make the business sustainable and deliver higher quality experiences. The company’s Metaverse leaders Gabriel Aul and Ryan Cairns reportedly told team that the delay is “going to give us a lot more breathing room to get the details right. ”Facebook already sells VR headsets and Ray-Ban smart glasses. The form factor of Meta's upcoming Glasses will reportedly be similar to that of Apple Vision Pro, with may be more power.In October 2021, after 17 years of being called Facebook, the social networking giant behind Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus got a new name. Facebook’s corporate entity became Meta. Mark Zuckerberg announced the change at the company’s AR/VR-focused Connect event, sharing that the new title captured more of the company’s core ambition: to build the metaverse.","Reality labs, meta's virtual reality unit, is likely to be cut by as much as 30%. The cuts are reportedly part of the company's annual budget planning for 2026. Analysts see the move reflecting the overall lack of interest in products like meta’s social virtual reality platform.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125785603,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-76476,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

How the latest funding round will help Phoebe Gates Phia app





Microsoft founder Bill Gates ' daughter Phoebe Gates has raised $30 million funding for her artificial intelligence (AI) shopping startup, Phia. The new funding values the company at $180 million. However, Phoebe Gates’ father has yet to invested in the venture. Instead, the Bill Gates donated his time and experience to her daughter’s startup. Earlier this year, the tech billionaire took to professional networking site LinkedIn to announce that he was doing a customer service shift to support the team in the days following the launch of the app. He said when a daughter asks for help at her startup, the only right answer is yes.In his LinkedIn post, Bill Gates shared a short clip offering a glimpse of his shift working in the customer service department of his daughter’s app. He wrote:The latest round of funding is a massive leap in value for Phoebe Gates' startup, coming just months after the New York-based company finished its first fundraising round. It will make the startup one of the most-watched companies in the booming AI market.The company has attracted a long list of famous backers. According to a pitch deck viewed by Bloomberg, investors include Hailey Bieber, Kris Jenner, Sheryl Sandberg, and Spanx founder Sara Blakely.Phia has been designed to serve as an intelligent shopping assistant. Its being offered as an AI agent that will fix the messy online shopping experience. According to the company, customers usually struggle to find what they want and companies end up advertising to people who aren’t interested and Phia will be able to resolve it.As a computer and mobile phone browser extension, Phia searches for products, price comparisons, and real-time discounts to help users in their buying decisions. Second-hand options are also highlighted by Phia to further assist people in shopping more 'green'.The new financial round is being led by major investment firms, including Notable Capital, Kleiner Perkins, and Khosla Ventures; investors with a history of supporting giants in the tech sector, such as Airbnb.Phia says it was downloaded 750,000 times in just eight months. The idea by Phoebe Gates and her co-founder Sophia Kianni was born while living in a Stanford dorm room; the initial plans were to make a smart tampon but later changed to fashion technology.A $250,000 grant from a Stanford social entrepreneurship program enabled them to work on the project full time and eventually move to New York. Kianni also took a break from her studies so that she could quickly learn everything about the industry they were going to work in, she told Vogue.","Microsoft founder bill gates'daughter phoebe gates has raised $30 million funding for her artificial intelligence (ai) shopping startup, phia.

Netflix has been hit with a consumer lawsuit seeking to block the online video giant's planned $72 billion acquisition of Warner Bros Discovery's studio and streaming businesses.The proposed class action was filed on Monday by a subscriber to Warner Bros-owned HBO Max who said the proposed deal threatened to reduce competition in the US subscription video-on-demand market.

AI videos are fooling millions on social media. No one is ready,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ai-videos-are-fooling-millions-on-social-media-no-one-is-ready/articleshow/125876523.cms,"



Videos created with OpenAI's new app Sora show how easily public perceptions can be manipulated by tools that can produce an alternate reality with a series of simple prompts. In the two months since Sora arrived, deceptive videos have surged on X, YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, according to experts who track them. The deluge has raised alarm over a new generation of disinformation and fakes.Most of the major social media companies have policies that require disclosure of AI use and broadly prohibit content intended to deceive. But those guardrails have proved woefully inadequate for the kind of technological leaps OpenAI's tools represent.While many videos are silly memes or fake images of babies and pets, others are meant to stoke the kind of vitriol that often characterises political debate. They have already figured in foreign influence operations. Researchers who have tracked deceptive uses said the onus was now on companies to do more to ensure people know what is real and what isn't.""Could they do better in content moderation for mis- and disinformation? Yes, they're clearly not doing that,"" said Sam Gregory, executive director of Witness, a human rights organisation focused on the threats of technology.""Could they do better in proactively looking for AI-generated information and labelling it? The answer is yes, as well.""The companies behind the AI tools say they are trying to make clear to users what content is generated by computers. Sora and the rival tool offered by Google, called Veo, both embed a visible watermark onto the videos they produce. Sora, for example, puts a ""Sora"" label on each video. Both companies also include invisible metadata, which can be read by a computer, that establishes the origin of each fake. The idea is to inform people that what they are seeing is not real and to give the platforms that feature them the digital signals to automatically detect them.Some platforms are using that technology. YouTube uses Sora's invisible watermark to append a small label indicating that the AI videos were ""altered or synthetic."" ""Viewers increasingly want more transparency about whether the content they're seeing is altered or synthetic,"" said Jack Malon, a YouTube spokesman.People with malicious intent have discovered that it is easy to get around the disclosure rules. Some manipulate the videos to remove the watermarks. Several firms have sprung up offering to remove logos and watermarks.OpenAI said it prohibits deceptive or misleading uses of Sora and takes action against violators of its policies. The company said its app was just one among dozens of similar tools capable of making increasingly lifelike videos - many of which do not employ any safeguards on use. A spokesman for Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, said it was not always possible to label every video generated by AI.","Deceptive videos have surged on x, youtube, facebook and instagram.

Pleading for concessions



Commercial fleet operators deeply concerned



Slow EV adoption weighs on profits







Europe's auto industry is braced for a major announcement from the EU on December 10, which could see significant changes made to the European Commission's proposed 2035 combustion engine phase-out.However, amid pressure from carmakers and other affected sectors such as car rental and car leasing companies, the announcement may now be pushed back until January.""We are still working on it,"" EU Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism Apostolos Tzitzikostas told the German business newspaper Handelsblatt this week. ""We want to present an automotive package that is truly comprehensive and covers all the necessary aspects.""Multiple media reports in recent weeks have suggested the EU Commission plans to force the electrification of rental, leasing and company-car markets by 2030, while significantly relaxing the wider 2035 ban on all internal combustion engines and allowing alternatives to electric vehicles (EVs).An executive with a major car rental company told DW that, based on their discussions with the EU, they expect the EU to propose strict electric vehicle quotas for what are known as fleet operators.They said the discussions suggested that car rental, car leasing and company-car operators could face a quota of up to 90% or higher by 2030.""The Commission is not looking for dialogue or discussion, that's our impression,"" the executive said.The EU Commission said it had no comment to add regarding the negotiations. A spokesperson told DW that preparations for the upcoming package were ""ongoing.""Back in 2022, the EU's 27 member states reached a deal to effectively ban sales of new combustion engine cars by agreeing to stop new registrations of vehicles that emit CO2 by 2035. The aim was to bring down the car sector's high emissions, as part of the bloc's strategy to become climate-neutral by 2050.However, Europe's car sector has been beleaguered by a range of problems in recent years, struggling with the technological challenge of the shift to electrification and with drastically ramped-up competition from China.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has been among those urging to EU to soften the 2035 cut-off date. He has asked Brussels for exemptions for various technologies including plug-in hybrids, battery hybrids and some range-extended electric systems which use a petrol-powered generator to charge the battery.""It is much more opportune and pragmatic to invest more effort and money in the development of efficient, hybrid systems that will combine the best of the world of internal combustion engines on the one hand and electric mobility on the other,"" Merz said.Europe's major carmakers support the German government's move.""The EU Commission is ignoring market realities and risking employment and competitiveness in one of its key industries,"" premium carmaker BMW said in a statement provided to DW. ""It is crucial that the CO2 regulations are redesigned promptly.""The company expects the EU Commission to seriously consider the German proposal before making its announcement. ""We are convinced that all drive systems can and must contribute,"" the statement said. ""Effective climate protection requires ambitious yet realistic guidelines, not targets that are detached from the market.""German brands such as BMW are particularly dominant when it comes to plug-in hybrids. Along with Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi, they accounted for more than 41% of all plug-in hybrid sales in the EU in the first ten months of the year. A relaxing of the 2035 ban in favor of plug-in hybrids would significantly benefit them.Yet, carmakers remain worried that any softening of the 2035 ban will be offset by the possible quotas on commercial fleets, which comprise around 60% of all new car registrations in Europe. Car rental firms are especially worried.Sixt, one of the largest European car rental companies, has been vocal about its opposition to the reported EU plans.It says a chronic lack of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles across Europe undermines any push towards electrification.""The regulation under discussion would affect more than 60% of all new registrations in Europe and would effectively bring forward the combustion engine ban by around eight years,"" a company spokesperson told DW.Sixt argues ""premature quotas"" would deepen Europe's existing dependency on China for batteries and mineral production vital to the automotive sector.""A transformation that increases dependency and reduces employment is heading in the wrong direction,"" the spokesperson said. ""Any regulatory framework must be aligned with real-world conditions — charging infrastructure, grid capacity, vehicle availability and customer demand.""Andrew Mountstephens, general counsel for Sixt, told DW that the company remains committed to emissions-free mobility. However, customer preference still tended strongly towards diesel and petrol cars.""We just had to realize that many customers were not yet prepared to go the same pace as we wanted to go,"" he said, adding that the lack of charging infrastructure across Europe was a central reason for this.Several car rental and car sharing companies have invested in electric models, only to see heavy losses due to lack of customer interest.Hertz reported a massive $2.9 billion (€2.49 billion) loss in 2024 largely due to a failed investment in tens of thousands of Tesla cars, which were expensive to maintain and which customers largely shunned.The problems with charging infrastructure and customer demand are widespread and have capped previously high expectations over how quickly Europeans would take to electric driving.While new registrations of electic vehicles in the EU rose dramatically from 2017 to 2023,there was a decline in 2024 and only 17% of cars registered in 2025 are expected to be fully electric.Patrick Schaufuss, the head of the Center for Future Mobility at consulting firm McKinsey, says he would expect the EU Commission to ""take those realities into account"" in whatever update it'll come up with.""The speed of the transition is maybe not as fast as we have wished for or had planned,"" he told DW, adding it's vital that any policy platform considers both decarbonization and economic success as ""part of a holistic approach.""Underscoring that long-term electrification will be the future, Schaufuss however noted that markets were ""decoupling"" and different regions move at different speeds. ""So this transition period is crucial, and maintaining economic success throughout this period is absolutely crucial.""",Eu expected to announce major changes to 2035 combustion engine ban on december 10. Announcement may now be pushed back until january. Car rental and car leasing companies are worried about possible electric vehicle quotas. German chancellor friedrich merz has been among those urging eu to soften the 2035 cut-off date.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125842223,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-779147,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
