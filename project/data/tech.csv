Govt eyes battery-swap hubs to ease long journeys for EVs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-eyes-battery-swap-hubs-to-ease-long-journeys-for-evs/articleshow/120708338.cms,"NEW DELHI: Government plans to provide subsidy for setting up battery swapping stations to ensure those undertaking long-distance travel don't have to spend time charging batteries of their electric vehicles , including buses and trucks, and can quickly resume their journey. People can swap batteries - exchanging discharged batteries with charged ones - at these centres by paying an amount.To begin with, the upstream subsidy for battery swapping stations is likely to be provided for setting up facilities for electric buses, trucks, two wheelers and three wheelers, sources said. Swapping of batteries of cars will take time as the standards for this have not been notified yet.The issue of setting up the stations was discussed at length last week by officials from Prime Minister's Office and ministries concerned.The proposal comes at a time when the share of electric vehicles (EVs) in all registered vehicles in 2024-25 increased to 7.3% from barely 0.01% in 2014-15. As per govt data, around 56.8 lakh EVs are registered in the country and the numbers are going to grow considering the govt's big push for green vehicles .The plan also gains significance considering that the govt has identified 61 national highways corridors - totalling 25,639km - for setting up public charging stations at every 100km on both sides for buses and trucks, and at every 20 km on both sides for cars.Officials said battery swapping stations can either be co-located with EV public charging stations or be standalones. ""The details of subsidies that can be provided would be worked out. Setting up battery swapping stations will be a big boost for operating more electric buses and trucks on long routes as these will meet their requirement,"" one of them said.Once the battery swapping protocol for cars is in place, it will revolutionalise EV penetration in the country.Some of the highway stretches put on the priority list for creating battery charging facilities include Delhi-Chandigarh, Delhi-Jaipur, Bangalore-Mumbai, Coimbatore-Bangalore, Goa-Pune, Chennai-Bangalore, Kochi-Kanyakumari, Prayagraj-Patna, Guwahati-Jorhat and Kharagpur-Visakhapatnam.",Government plans to provide subsidy for setting up battery swapping stations.

Shaquille O’Neal has fallen out of love with the Tesla Cybertruck

“It Was A Sad Day For Me” Shaq Reflects On WWE Being Fake + Karlous Calls Out Stephen A & Tom Brady

Former NBA star turned sports analyst Shaquille O’Neal once showed off his custom Tesla Cybertruck on Instagram. He has now fallen out of love with the car and has revealed selling off two of them for not getting the desired mileage. Instead, he has now purchased a Cadillac Escalade IQ , which he says gives him much better output with the same amount of energy than the Cybertruck. The NBA player is very fond of cars and referred to them as “girlfriends” while talking about them.Shaquille O’Neal was on The Big Podcast where a comedian sarcastically praised him for always getting cars customized from every car shop in America. Not only this, he also mentioned how the generous Shaq once gifted a van to a family with many kids.Talking about why he got rid of his Cybertrucks, Shaq said, “I was into Cybertrucks but they don’t give enough charge mileage. Then I just got one of those IQs system Escalades. Today I was in Vegas, I ain’t have to charge up for four days. My Cybertruck here, if I go downtown to work tonight and come back, I’m gonna be struggling to get back. Right now it says 267. If I go to Atlanta to the thing and come back, when I come back it ain’t going to be…”The Cadillac Escalade IQ has a much better mileage on a single charge than the Tesla Cybertruck. While the Cybertruck can give around 510 km per charge, the Cadillac Escalade can give 745 km per charge, reportedly.When another guest mentioned how Shaq always brings the most expensive cars to work when he goes to the set of Inside The NBA, Shaq joked, “I treat them like girlfriends, my police car girlfriend I haven’t seen in a while so I will probably take her on a date tonight. But I am leaving tomorrow for another week so I will probably take my favorite girlfriend out tonight.”Also Read: Gilbert Arenas' son Alijah Arenas hospitalized following Tesla Cybertruck crash, graphic footage surfaces Recently, former NBA player Gilbert Arenas' son Alijah Arenas had a serious accident when his Tesla Cybertruck crashed into a tree near his home.

The moment Cam Ward won over Titans



""You don’t draft me, you’re gonna pay for it,""

""I mean it. I stand on it.""

Titans’ future tied to Cam Ward



The Tennessee Titans didn’t just draft a quarterback; they staked their future on one. When their moment came in Detroit at the 2025 NFL Draft, Brian Callahan and new GM Mike Borgonzi didn’t blink. They grabbed Cam Ward with the first overall pick, setting off fireworks and, quietly, a storm of second-guessing across the league. For a franchise desperate to escape mediocrity, this was more than a gamble, it was an all-in bet on a young man who talks as boldly as he plays.Leading up to draft night, Titans coaches and scouts spent months picking apart every snap Ward played from his days lighting it up at Incarnate Word to his final season at Miami. The arm strength was impressive. The playmaking was electric. But they needed to know if the confidence was real or just another sales pitch.In a closed-door meeting, Ward made it crystal clear.he said.Bold words. But Callahan wasn’t impressed just yet. He pushed back, calling it the oldest line in the book. Was Ward just repeating what he thought they wanted to hear?Ward didn’t back down.That moment stuck. It wasn’t rehearsed, it was real. And it sealed the Titans’ decision.Picking Cam Ward wasn’t the ""safe"" move. Some scouts loved him, some had their doubts. His last season had flashes of brilliance but also rough patches. And being a college star doesn’t guarantee NFL greatness.The Titans know the risk. They know this pick could make Brian Callahan a hero or put him on the hot seat by Christmas.Also Read: Shedeur Sanders’ unbelievable NFL Draft slide: Bruce Feldman reveals NFL’s biggest oversight of 2025 Ward’s got the big arm, the bigger swagger, and the fearless attitude every franchise dreams about.

VTuber Sinder controversy explained: Allegations and Full Timeline,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/news/vtuber-sinder-controversy-explained-allegations-and-full-timeline/articleshow/120691648.cms,"Image via Sinder

Nanoless accuses Sinder and REDACTED about slandering other creators, exclusivity & blacklisting other creators



“I will start with screenshots showing them speaking ill of other creators & spreading rumors while manipulating me that it’s all in our best interest. In addition to spreading ill rumors they also complain and accuse

Bao

of giving “their” editor too much work, resulting in the editor not having any time for new clients which will be important later on. The screenshots below show them showing their affection & appreciation immediately followed by spreading rumors & lies to make other clients appear problematic to manipulate any future decisions regarding commissions.”

""They mentioned wanting an exclusivity contract, but they didn’t want to pay for exclusivity, but rather when a creator from their blacklist comes asking for a commission, they would guarantee me model work for Sinder only and if anyone asked me for commissions, they’d commission me instead to compensate for not working with other creators. This felt very strange given that one of the accusations they made was overworking their editor yet their “solution” to me working with other creators was for them to essentially overwork me to keep me from working on other projects.""

“The messages below show that their primary concern is that the more non Sinder models I make, the less “valuable” my existing models become. It’s hard to say how much this messed with my mind as an artist that by working with other people I’m somehow making my existing models less special.”

Vampeaches reveals that REDACTED is Sinder’s boyfriend



""I remember playing Phasmophobia with you and hearing RED chat away next to you before you first debuted like 4 years ago. You told me he was your boyfriend. Then before we met for Twitchcon you switched up and said 'just so you know my manager is coming with me on this trip' as if I didn't know who he was. It's even ickier to read this tweet knowing he is your significant other and that you're probably going to try and avoid taking responsibility for hurting people who trusted you as friends by nuking the RED side of this duo.""

Sinder’s official apology



“Redacted has been my co-content creator since I began making content, managing all aspects of what I do, and being a major part of why I’m here. We have also been in a relationship since the start of my endeavors. It’s no secret that many vtubers choose to keep their public and personal lives separate, and I’m no different. As of yesterday he is no longer working with me, and I have not extensively discussed any of this with him. Where our personal situation goes from here will be figured out between us privately. I never intended to mention us publicly, but given that the claims are out there, I want everyone to know I’m taking this seriously. After years of working on everything together, his hyper business oriented outlook warped my view of what it is I should be doing, and what should be important to me as I navigate this career path. I have a terrible work life balance as it is, and being around projects and streams all day every day made me lose sight of the point. It took all of this happening for me to realize this behavior isn’t normal or healthy, and it’s not an outlook I want to have. This doesn’t absolve me of the things I’ve willingly done wrong and went along with, or the way I’ve treated people who were fully undeserving.”

“In regards to Nanoless, for the majority of the time working with her, Red was the one almost solely doing the communication about new plans and negotiations through his private DMs. Nano had a project server we were all a part of where the actual art and models were worked on, but the conversations were focused around the work itself. I was not fully aware of the extent of Red’s manipulation over Nano’s commission decisions, and I should’ve been more diligent in my oversight.”

The popular Twitch VTuber Sinder has come under negative limelight following accusations from the Vtuber artist Nanoless, who issued a Google document about the termination of work. Within the same, Nanoless accused Sinder and her manager REDCATED about “manipulating, using, and dragging them into drama, while sabotaging, slandering & spreading lies about people they thought were the VTuber’s closest friends.The document was posted on Nanoless’ X handle on April 26, 2025, and the controversy has spread like wildfire since then. Here we take a detailed look at all the accusations aimed at VTuber Sinder and REDCATED.Nanoless’ document consists of several allegations, the first one being about Sinder and REDACTED slandering other creators. As part of the same, the VTuber artist shared several Discord screenshots with that of REDACTED. Nanoless claimed that the two spoke ill and spread rumors about other streamers.Nanoless exactly stated:Added to this, Nanoless’ document also mentions about REDACTED speaking ill about Vtubers like Shylily, who is another popular name.Coming to the exclusivity, Sinder and REDACTED essentially wanted to issue an exclusivity contract but didn’t want to pay about the same. Nanoless additionally mentioned that they would compensate for not working with content creators that they had blacklisted. The document mentions:She also added:The screenshots related to the same are on the document itself. You can find the same by heading over to Nanoless’ X account (@Nanoless_)Following the official post by Nanoless, Sinder announced that REDACTED will no longer manager her VTuber activities, and completely cut ties with her manager. Vampeaches responded to this post by revealing that REDACTED is Sinder’s boyfriend. She mentioned the following:Finally, Sinder posted a document titled “My Apology” on April 28, 2025.

Shedeur Sanders’ NFL Draft Fall: Bruce Feldman explains how NFL teams got it wrong



Shedeur Sanders Pro Day ""Revealed Potentially Devastating Flaw?!"" | Pat McAfee Show

""So much of being an NFL backup quarterback is how comfortable the starter is with the other two QBs in the room.

Sanders

has always been the starting QB and the star wherever he’s been, at Jackson State and then Colorado. I suspect his fit played a role in why so many teams opted not to pick him earlier,""

Was Shedeur Sanders the hidden gem of the 2025 NFL Draft?



Shedeur Sanders was supposed to be one of the hottest prospects in the 2025 NFL Draft. But when the former Colorado Buffaloes star fell all the way to the fifth round, taken at pick No. 144 by the Cleveland Browns , it left fans and analysts stunned. How could a player with his pedigree, who was once projected to go in the top five slip so drastically? Was it a major misjudgment by NFL teams, or is there something deeper behind his unexpected fall?Despite Shedeur Sanders' hype, several NFL teams passed on him for lesser-known quarterbacks. Bruce Feldman of The Athletic suggests the reason was chemistry. Teams doubted Sanders’ ability to adapt to a backup role, as he’s always been the star quarterback and leader at every level.Feldman stated.But that’s not the whole story. Anonymous NFL scouts have been outspoken about Sanders’ performance, with one offensive coordinator even suggesting that Sanders isn’t a complete quarterback. While they praised his intelligence and toughness, they criticized his inconsistent play, citing his 94 sacks over two seasons at Colorado as a major red flag. His perceived lack of elite arm strength and running ability only added fuel to the fire.The truth is, Sanders’ fall could be one of the biggest mistakes in recent draft history. His college career at Colorado demonstrated poise, leadership, and a skill set that should have positioned him much higher in the draft. Yet, as the NFL focused on his perceived weaknesses, they overlooked his potential for growth. Now, as a Cleveland Brown in a competitive quarterback room with Dillon Gabriel, Kenny Pickett, and Joe Flacco, Sanders has the chance to turn his critics into believers.Also Read: Saquon Barkley reacts to White House visit with President Trump: Here’s how he responded—“Now Ya Get Out My Mentions” Shedeur Sanders’ unexpected slide to the fifth round could actually be a great thing for his career.

Whether he meets the high expectations or becomes a warning for other teams, Sanders is determined to show that his draft fall was a mistake teams will regret.","Shedeur sanders was projected to go in the top five in the 2025 nfl draft.

Nintendo enthusiasts in Japan got an exclusive opportunity to test the much-anticipated Switch 2 gaming console at a pre-launch event near Tokyo. The event, held at the Makuhari Messe convention center, showcased new titles like Mario Kart World and Donkey Kong Bonanza, drawing large crowds eager to experience the successor to the original Switch, which has sold over 150 million units since its 2017 debut.""Since Mr. Trump became president tariffs have gone up so I am concerned about a price hike not just for the game console but for accessories too,"" said Hidenori Tanaka, 55, a real estate company employee, who attended the event.Despite the excitement, concerns over potential price hikes due to global trade tariffs have cast a shadow over the launch. Tariffs imposed by the US on trading partners, including China, have raised production costs for electronic devices. While some tariffs have been eased, fears of a renewed trade war persist. Nintendo initially paused pre-orders in the US to assess the impact but later confirmed a price of $449.99 for the console in the region.In Japan, the Switch 2 is priced at 49,980 yen ($350), and demand has been overwhelming, with 2.2 million applications submitted for the lottery to purchase the console. Nintendo is hosting similar hands-on events globally, including in New York, Berlin, and Hong Kong, to build anticipation ahead of the console’s official launch on June 5, 2025.The Switch 2’s debut marks a critical moment for Nintendo as it navigates supply chain challenges and tariff uncertainties while aiming to replicate the success of its predecessor.","Nintendo held a pre-launch event for the switch 2 gaming console near tokyo.

Read Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan full letter to employees

Team,

Today we reported our Q1 2025 results. It was a step in the right direction as we delivered revenue, gross margin and EPS (earnings per share) above our guidance, driven by Dave and Michelle’s leadership. I want to thank them both, and all of you, for the good execution.

We need to build on this progress — and it won’t be easy. We are navigating an increasingly volatile and uncertain macroeconomic environment, which is reflected in our Q2 outlook. On top of that, there are many areas where we must improve. We need to confront our challenges head-on and take swift actions to get back on track.

As I have said, this starts by revamping our culture. The feedback I have received from our customers and many of you has been consistent. We are seen as too slow, too complex and too set in our ways — and we need to change.

Our flatter Executive Team (ET) structure that I shared last week was a first step. The next step is to drive greater simplicity, speed and collaboration across the entire company. To achieve these objectives, today I am announcing some important changes.

Becoming an Engineering-Focused Company

We need to get back to our roots and empower our engineers. That’s why I elevated our core engineering functions to the ET. And many of the changes we will be driving are designed to make engineers more productive by removing burdensome workflows and processes that slow down the pace of innovation.

To make necessary investments in our engineering talent and technology roadmaps, we need to find new ways to reduce our costs. While we have taken significant actions in the last year, our current cost structure is still well above competitive benchmarks. With that in mind, we have reduced our operating expense and capital spending targets going forward, which I will discuss during our investor call this afternoon.

Flattening the Organization

As we refocus on engineering, we will also remove organizational complexity. Many teams are eight or more layers deep, which creates unnecessary bureaucracy that slows us down. I have asked the ET to take a fresh look at their respective orgs, with a focus on removing layers, increasing spans of control and empowering top performers. Our competitors are lean, fast and agile — and that’s what we must become to improve our execution.

I’ve been surprised to learn that, in recent years, the most important KPI for many managers at Intel has been the size of their teams. Going forward, this will not be the case. I’m a big believer in the philosophy that the best leaders get the most done with the fewest people. We will embrace this mindset across the company, which will include empowering our top talent to make decisions and take greater ownership of key priorities.

There is no way around the fact that these critical changes will reduce the size of our workforce. As I said when I joined, we need to make some very hard decisions to put our company on a solid footing for the future. This will begin in Q2 and we will move as quickly as possible over the next several months.

We are going to be very intentional about where we focus these efforts and how we stack up against the best in the industry. We have learned some valuable lessons from past actions. We must balance our reductions with the need to retain and recruit key talent. I will empower each of my leaders to make the best possible decisions aligned with our top priorities. These decisions will not be made lightly, and we will keep you regularly informed.

Streamlining Our Processes

It has been eye-opening for me to see how much time and energy is spent on internal administrative work that does not move our business forward. We need to radically simplify this to maximize the time spent focusing on our customers.

I am instructing our leaders to eliminate unnecessary meetings and significantly reduce the number of meeting attendees. Too much valuable time is being wasted. We will also modernize processes with a focus on live dashboards and better data to ensure we have the real-time insights we need to make better and faster decisions.

In addition, I have decided to make our formal Insights and OKR requirements optional. While it’s crucial for us to stay accountable for our results and receive feedback on our performance, I believe we can achieve this in a simpler and more flexible way. Along the same lines, we will cut back on time-consuming corporate administrative tasks such as non-essential training and documentation.

Returning to the Office

Our existing policy is that our hybrid employees should spend approximately three days per week on site. Adherence to this policy has been uneven at best. I strongly believe that our sites need to be vibrant hubs of collaboration that reflect our culture in action.

When we spend time together in person, it fosters more engaging and productive discussion and debate. It drives better and faster decision-making. And it strengthens our connection with colleagues.

With that in mind, we will be updating our policy to require four days per week on site by Sept. 1. I wanted to tell you well in advance so that you have time to make any adjustments to your daily routines. We are going to work hard in the meantime to ensure sites are ready to operate at full capacity. Your local leadership will share site-specific details and seek your input on how to create the best possible on-site experience.

Building a New Intel

I realize this is a lot to take in, but we are playing from behind and we need to rally as a team to put ourselves in the best possible position to win.

This requires us to be laser-focused on developing the best products. We need to delight our customers and earn their trust by delivering the performance, quality and reliability they need to succeed. We must demonstrate predictable execution and ensure on-time delivery. And we need to deliver consistent returns for our shareholders.

There are two ways teams can respond at make-or-break moments like this: They can look at the gap they need to close and give up — or they can look inside themselves and fight like never before.

I made my choice last month when I decided to join you all, and there is no place I would rather be right now. I came on board knowing full well this would be the most challenging job of my career, but also the most motivating and fulfilling — because we have opportunities ahead that most people don’t get in their careers.

I’m talking about the opportunity to fundamentally reinvent an industry icon. To pull off a comeback that will be studied in business schools for generations to come. To create new technologies and deploy them at scale to change the world for the better.

Intel was once widely seen as the world’s most innovative company. There’s no reason we can’t get back there, so long as we drive the changes needed to improve.

It’s going to be hard. It will require painful decisions. But we will make them knowing it’s what we must do to serve our customers better as we build a new Intel for the future – and I have great confidence in the power of our team and our people to make it happen.

Thank you for everything you did in Q1. I look forward to talking more tomorrow during our All Company Meeting.

Lip-Bu Tan

Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has announced sweeping restructuring measures including layoffs, management cuts, and an expanded return-to-office mandate as the struggling chipmaker attempts to regain its competitive edge. The changes aim to eliminate ""unnecessary bureaucracy"" and streamline operations to foster innovation, and Tan notes that “this starts by revamping our [company’s] culture.""""I've been surprised to learn that, in recent years, the most important KPI for many managers at Intel has been the size of their teams. Going forward, this will not be the case. I'm a big believer in the philosophy that the best leaders get the most done with the fewest people,"" Tan wrote in a company memo. The company didn’t specify the exact number of job cuts, but with around 108,900 employees at the end of last year, reports suggest up to 20% of the workforce could be impacted.""Many teams are eight or more layers deep, which creates unnecessary bureaucracy that slows us down,"" Tan wrote in a company memo. The new CEO, who has been at the helm for only five weeks, is targeting $1.5 billion in operating expense reductions over the next two years.The flattening will begin in Q2, and Tan says will be continuing into the next few months.These cuts follow a previous round of layoffs just eight months ago when Intel eliminated 15,000 positions.The restructuring prioritizes engineering talent and aims to make engineers ""more productive by removing burdensome workflows and processes that slow down the pace of innovation."" Tan is shifting focus away from measuring management success by team size toward a leaner structure emphasizing execution.The announcement came as Intel released disappointing first-quarter earnings, and the company has struggled to keep pace with industry shifts toward artificial intelligence, which Tan identified as a key focus moving forward.Intel also recently announced that starting September 1, it will require four in-office days weekly from its employees. This change replaced the company's two-day remote policy to boost collaboration. Tan made this announcement as a part of a strategic roadmap during the company’s Q1 2025 earnings call.","Ceo lip-bu tan: ""we are seen as too slow, too complex and too set in our ways — and we need to change"" tan: we need to get back to our roots and empower our engineers.

OpenAI updates ChatGPT search with new shopping features: Here’s how itworks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/openai-updates-chatgpt-search-with-new-shopping-features-heres-how-itworks/articleshow/120714729.cms,"ChatGPT competing with Google



How the shopping feature in ChatGPT search works



Search Query Input: Users can ask detailed questions or describe what they are looking for, such as “Best headphones under $100” or “Stylish table lamps for my living room.” Data Integration: ChatGPT processes the query and retrieves relevant information about products, including images, reviews, pricing, and purchase links. This data is sourced from online retailers and other shopping platforms. Tailored Suggestions: The AI provides customised recommendations based on the user’s query, offering insights on products that align with their requirements. Independent Results: OpenAI ensures that the results are unbiased and not influenced by ads, prioritising a user-centric experience. Direct Shopping Links: Users are provided with links to purchase the suggested items directly, streamlining the shopping process.

Future Enhancements



OpenAI has introduced a significant update to ChatGPT, adding shopping capabilities to its search tool. This enhancement allows users to find products, compare options, view images and reviews, and access direct purchase links—all within the chatbot interface. The new feature enables users to ask detailed, natural-language questions and receive tailored product recommendations. Initially, the shopping categories include fashion, beauty, home goods, and electronics, with plans to expand further. OpenAI emphasised that the results are independently determined and not influenced by advertisements.This update positions ChatGPT as a direct competitor to Google’s search engine, offering a more personalised and ad-free shopping experience. OpenAI reported that ChatGPT users conducted over 1 billion web searches last week, highlighting the growing popularity of its search capabilities.The shopping feature in ChatGPT search works by leveraging natural-language processing to deliver personalised product recommendations based on user queries. Here's how it operates:OpenAI plans to integrate its memory feature with shopping for Pro and Plus users, enabling even more personalised recommendations based on previous interactions.

After going viral, Gia Duddy tells future WAGs the one thing they should watch out for



As the curtains fell on the 2025 NFL Draft, a familiar name resurfaced—not from the war rooms or the draft boards, but from the sidelines of a viral moment that defined a past draft night. Influencer Gia Duddy , once the talk of the internet during the 2023 NFL Draft, found herself back in the spotlight, not for her relationship with Tennessee Titans quarterback Will Levis , but for the legacy of that unforgettable night.Duddy became a household name two years ago when ESPN cameras continually captured her alongside then-boyfriend Levis, whose dramatic slide out of the first round shocked fans and analysts alike. While Levis waited in Kansas City for a call that never came on Day 1, Duddy’s composed yet captivating presence became a trending topic—so much so that Levis later joked, ""Her followers doubled on draft night and I was like 'I need a cut of this.'""In the aftermath of that fateful evening, Duddy’s social media presence skyrocketed. Her Instagram followers surged, and she soon found herself navigating a new world of influencer deals, including a lighthearted Burger King partnership. Levis quipped, “You’re paying for lunch,” referencing her sudden influencer success. But behind the viral fame was a young woman navigating uninvited attention and the media's thirst for drama.Now, in 2025, Duddy has long moved on from her relationship with Levis—they officially split in September 2023—but not from the draft conversation. With this year's draft moments taking internet, fans took to her TikTok, flooding her with questions and nostalgia. Eventually, she responded, not with bitterness, but with humor and wisdom.“I know I know what tonight is, but do you guys know what tonight is? It's the Caudalie event, obviously, so let's get ready,” she joked, blending levity with acknowledgment. While prepping for a skincare event, she paused to deliver a candid message for the next wave of NFL girlfriends stepping into the limelight.“I feel like I've never really talked about the draft... just because it just genuinely wasn't about me,” she said, highlighting how the attention on her felt unwarranted. Yet, she extended heartfelt congratulations to the 2025 draft class and offered a cheeky tip to attendees: “Beware of your resting bh face... the media loves media, and they will start a story that you're just a bh.”She also took a moment to debunk a long-standing internet theory about her asking to pee on live TV: “I was literally just asking, ‘Can that happen?’ Because they were talking about the Titans trading up.” Her clarification shed light on just how easily stories can spiral in the age of viral content.Today, with over 309,000 followers on Instagram and half a million on TikTok, Duddy has carved a unique niche as a beauty and lifestyle influencer. Although her plans to pursue nursing after following Levis to Nashville never came to fruition, she has clearly found her footing—and her voice.In reflecting on the moment that unintentionally launched her public persona, Gia Duddy’s message to others caught in the NFL Draft whirlwind is clear: embrace the chaos, laugh through the awkwardness, and remember—it’s not always about you, but how you carry yourself when the spotlight hits.Also Read: Shilo Sanders 'fired' dad Deion Sanders as agent amid outrage over brother Shedeur's NFL Draft fall","Two years after her draft fame, gia duddy offers surprising tip to nfl wags in the spotlight.

Bangladesh Currency Crisis: Bangladesh faces currency crisis as central bank halts issuing notes featuring Mujibur Rahman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-faces-currency-crisis-as-central-bank-halts-issuing-notes-featuring-mujibur-rahman/articleshow/120714882.cms,"Approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused

DHAKA: The central bank of Bangladesh has apparently incurred a huge financial loss due to the interim govt’s decision not to issue previously printed notes, with approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remaining unused. The decision aligns with govt’s efforts to diminish Bangabandhu’s presence in public memory.Although bank officials are unwilling to discuss the matter publicly, many, on conditions of anonymity, said the longstanding tradition of obtaining new notes from Bangladesh Bank has been abruptly halted, creating a crisis in the market. On the one hand, the printed money is being wasted without use; on the other hand, customers are suffering as a result, they added.“Notes of various denominations are printed using paper and ink purchased with people’s taxes. Millions of notes with Bangabandhu’s picture are still lying in the vaults of various banks. The Security Printing Corporation does not have the capacity to cancel all the notes at once and print new ones. Therefore, notes with Bangabandhu’s picture cann’t be suddenly cancelled,” Ziauddin Ahmed, former executive director of Bangladesh Bank and former managing director of Security Printing Corporation, told reporters.In this situation, he suggested the printed notes be circulated in the market to alleviate public suffering. “When new design notes come into the market, the old ones should be gradually withdrawn. Generally, notes printed once can be used for a maximum of four to five years,” Ahmed said.According to media reports, Bangladesh Bank is unable to issue new notes to banks in line with demand. The crisis became evident following the country’s political upheaval in Aug last year.Since all forms of currency, including metal coins, feature Mujibur’s image, Bangladesh Bank abruptly stopped issuing new notes early April. As a result, the notes featuring Bangabandhu’s image are not reaching the market. Shops, banks, and citizens are now left with torn and old, dirty notes.According to sources at Bangladesh Bank, the Security Printing Corporation is set to begin printing new design notes next month. In the first phase, new design notes of 20, 50, and 1,000 taka will be printed and subsequently released in the market through banks.","Approximately taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused.

Poll Do you believe that hostile takeovers are becoming a trend in the Italian banking industry? No, it's just a temporary situation. Yes, it's a growing trend.

ROME: Italian bank Mediobanca, itself battling to fend off a hostile takeover by a rival, announced on Monday a 6.3 billion euro ($7.2 billion) bid to buy wealth management firm Banca Generali.Mediobanca is planning to use its 13.1 percent stake in Italy's largest insurance company, Generali, to pay for the acquisition of the group subsidiary Banca Generali, the statement said.""The combination between the two companies will produce a European market leader,"" Mediobanca said.Mediobanca is itself trying to fend off a hostile takeover by state-backed Banca Monte Paschi di Siena (MPS) as the Italian banking industry sees a wave of hostile bids.Mediobanca's offer stipulates that if it does not manage to acquire a minimum of 50 percent plus one of the total number of Banca Generali shares, then it would abandon its takeover bid.It said the takeover would result in its wealth management revenues doubling to two billion euros and such profits increasing fourfold to 800 million euros.In a statement, it said the acquisition would ""transform the relationship between Mediobanca and AG from a financial to a strong industrial partnership"".In January, Mediobanca rejected a 13.3-billion-euro bid from MPS, which had been backed by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni's government.The Mediobanca board branded the offer ""devoid of industrial and financial rationale"" and thus ""destructive"" for the bank.MPS, the world's oldest bank, had wanted to create a banking group to rival the two biggest in the country, Intesa Sanpaolo and Unicredit.MPS was bailed out by the Italian government in 2017, when it was on the verge of bankruptcy, and Rome became its main shareholder.Banca Generali's shares were up 7.5 percent in morning trading while MPS gained 3.1 percent, Mediobanca rose 0.6 percent and Generali dropped almost two percent.","Mediobanca is planning to use its 13.1 percent stake in italy's largest insurance company, generali, to pay for the acquisition of the group subsidiary banca generali.

SEOUL: Chinese artificial intelligence app DeepSeek was transferring personal data to a cloud services platform without users' consent while it was still available for download, South Korea 's data protection authority said on Thursday.The Personal Information Protection Commission ( PIPC ) said the information, which included device, network, and user inputs in AI prompts, was transferred to servers at Beijing platform Volcano Engine .DeepSeek's R1 chatbot stunned investors and industry insiders in January with its ability to match the functions of its Western competitors at a fraction of the cost.However, countries including South Korea, Italy and Australia and some US states have questioned DeepSeek's storage of user data and have banned or restricted its use.The PIPC launched an investigation in February and said DeepSeek would no longer be available for download until a review of its personal data collection practices was completed.""Initially, DeepSeek transferred personal data to companies located in China and the United States without obtaining users' consent or disclosing this in the privacy policy at the time the service was launched,"" commission official Nam Seok told reporters.""In particular, it was confirmed that DeepSeek transferred not only device, network, and app information, but also user inputs in AI prompts to Volcano Engine,"" he said.Following the investigation, DeepSeek ""acknowledged it had insufficiently considered Korea 's data protection laws, expressed its willingness to cooperate with the commission, and voluntarily suspended new downloads from domestic app markets"", Nam said.DeepSeek did not immediately respond to a request for comment.
