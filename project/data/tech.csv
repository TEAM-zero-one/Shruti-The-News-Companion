NEW DELHI/KOLKATA: In a move to track the origin and manufacturing of all batteries and help consumers get details of their life and performance, govt has come up with proposed guidelines for Battery Pack Aadhaar Number. Under this, every battery pack will have machine-readable, 21-character alphanumeric code and QR code storing all such details.The digital framework, which will work like a ""battery passport"", is aimed at tracking batteries across their lifecycle, from manufacturing and use to recycling and disposal. While the guidelines focus exclusively on EV applications, they would be extended to industrial batteries with a capacity greater than 2kWh at a later stage. ""SLI and portable batteries are outside scope of this document,"" the draft norms said.The code will contain static data such as battery material, descriptor and carbon footprint parameters, which will be accessible to public. This data remains unchanged unless there is a physical replacement of components or modification of battery's operational parameters by its management system. The battery's dynamic data will be stored, maintained and updated via a server.It will give real-time insights into the battery's performance.Preeti Bajaj, CEO and MD, Luminous Power Technologies, called it a ""pivotal shift for India's battery ecosystem"", creating lifecycle transparency from manufacturing to end-of-life recycling.""The framework mirrors global thinking,"" she said.","The digital framework will work like a ""battery passport"" aimed at tracking batteries across their lifecycle.

NEW DELHI: Govt on Friday directed Elon Musk-owned social media platform X to remove, without delay, all obscene, indecent, sexually explicit and unlawful content, especially that generated by its AI app Grok, failing which it might have to face legal consequences.The Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) issued a notice to the chief compliance officer of 'X Corp' (India operations) for failure to observe statutory due diligence obligations under the IT Act, 2000, and the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021, and sought within 72 hours a detailed action taken report, to prevent generation and transmission of explicit content through the misuse of Al-based services like 'Grok' and xAlts.""Non-compliance with the above requirements shall be viewed seriously and may result in strict legal consequences against your platform, without any further notice, under the IT Act, the IT Rules, BNSS, BNS and other applicable laws,"" MeitY said in its communication to X.The ministry highlighted that it has been reported from time to time, including through representations from Members of Parliament, that certain categories of content circulating on X platform may not be in compliance with laws relating to decency and obscenity.It has been especially observed that ""Grok AI"" service is being misused by users to create fake accounts that host, generate, publish or share images or videos of women that depict them in a derogatory or vulgar manner.Against this backdrop, the ministry has directed that X must immediately undertake a comprehensive technical, procedural and governance-level review of the Al-based application ""Grok"". X has also been directed to ""enforce its user terms of service, acceptable use policies and AI usage restrictions, including strong deterrent measures such as suspension, termination and other enforcement actions against violating users and accounts"".Copies of the notice have been sent to the ministries of home affairs, women and child development, information and broadcasting, and NCW, NCPCR and chief secretaries of all states and UTs.","The ministry of electronics and it issued a notice to the chief compliance officer of 'x corp' (india operations) for failure to observe statutory due diligence obligations.

NEW DELHI: Soon all private vehicles like cars and bikes will have to get their fitness and pollution tests done at automated test stations (ATS) for renewal of registration as it is in the case of commercial vehicles. The ATS or the inspecting officer will also need to upload at least a 10 seconds geotagged video of the vehicle at the time of fitness test before issuing any certificate.The road transport ministry has proposed key changes in the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, including this, through a draft notification to prevent the malpractice of vehicle owners managing to get fitness certificates even without visiting ATS or other testing centres. This also gains significance in the light of increasing concern over air pollution and fitness of vehicles.Fitness certificate is mandatory for renewal of registration of private vehicles after attaining 15 years, and subsequently, in every five years.As per the draft notification, private vehicles, like commercial ones, will need to visit ATS, where these are established, for fitness tests. At present, there are over 160 ATS operational across the country.To ensure that the certificates are issued after carrying out genuine tests, the draft notification says that “the renewal of a certificate of fitness shall be made only after uploading at least a 10 seconds geotagged video of the vehicle at the time of fitness test, capturing the vehicle from front, rear, right side and left side ensuring clear visibility of the registration number plate, chassis number, engine number and features of the vehicle” by an authorised testing station or inspecting officer after carrying out the specified tests.In a bid to avoid vehicle owners using legal provisions to apply for multiple re-tests after vehicles fail to pass the fitness test, the proposed norms say that if a vehicle is not declared as ‘fit’ within 180 days from the first date of vehicle declared as ‘unfit’ the vehicle shall be categorised as ‘End of Life Vehicle (ELV)’ and flagged in the Vahan database as ‘ELV’.Officials said till now people used to get the timeline extended by simply submitting fees just days before the expiry of 180 days. “That won’t be possible any more. They need to get the fitness certificate within 180 days from the day the first test found the vehicle as unfit. Enough safeguards have been put in place to ensure that any ATS doesn’t give incorrect test result,” said an official.",The road transport ministry has proposed key changes in the central motor vehicles rules.

His vehicles, including a flame-shooting Lamborghini Aventador and a customized Ford F-250, often made spring training parking lots resemble car shows. This collection, estimated at nearly $1 million, reflects his perception of cars as symbols of freedom and achievement.

Inside Yoenis Céspedes’ supercars and custom builds

Lamborghini Aventador (custom-built flame exhaust)

Alfa Romeo 8C Competizione (limited-production Italian supercar)

Ford F-250 (customised heavy-duty truck)

Several Polaris Slingshots (modified three-wheel roadsters)

Jeep Wrangler (customized off-road vehicle)

What Céspedes' car collection says about his lifestyle





Yoenis Cespedes was never just another power hitter in the major league baseball. The former Oakland A's and the New York Mets star is known to bring that same flair to his life off the field. Very few players in the Major League Baseball have expressed their success in the larger-than-life manner as Cespedes did through his collection of luxury cars, which made spring training parking lots resemble unofficial car shows.The interest of Céspedes in high-performance machines gained popularity during his time playing with the New York Mets. His coming to spring training gained a lot of attention as much as his batting sessions did. A Lamborghini Aventador, which is traditionally priced at around $300,000, was the biggest treasure of Céspedes' collection, even before customization. This supercar came laced with some customized paint, wheels, a redesigned interior, and a flame-shooting exhaust that made it iconic quickly. Cespedes owns luxury, rare, and several off-road vehicles, most of which were customised to a large extent. His car collection consists of:A number of these cars were redesigned by the famed car designer, Alex Vega, who assisted in bringing Cespedes' concepts to life to create one-of-a-kind car statements.The mix of supercars and off-road trucks was a sign of Céspedes's admiration of both speed and power.For Céspedes, luxury cars are the ultimate measure of financial success. Having been brought up in Cuba, where people did not possess as many cars as they do in the United States, he tended to perceive cars as a source of liberty and success. Today, Céspedes’ car collection, comprising both large-scale customization and numerous pieces, was estimated to be near $1 million, which made his garage one of the hottest topics among MLB players. Céspedes has retired from Major League Baseball, but his luxury car collection still constitutes a part of his off-field legacy.Also Read: Is Juan Soto dating anyone?

AI-powered VTuber Neuro-Sama rewrites Twitch history by becoming the platform’s most subscribed streamer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/ai-powered-vtuber-neuro-sama-rewrites-twitch-history-by-becoming-the-platforms-most-subscribed-streamer/articleshow/126308833.cms,"Neuro-Sama (via X/@Vedal987)

How Neuro-sama’s technology, consistency, and timing fueled an unprecedented rise





An unprecedented achievement on Twitch has now become a focus for many fans. For the first time, the most subscribed streamer on the platform is an entry no one could have imagined. An AI-powered VTuber named Neuro-sama has surged and taken over every creator on Twitch, overtaking Jynxzi, who was the placeholder before.Streaming on the Vedal987 channel, Neuro-sama now sits comfortably at the top, leaving some of the biggest names far behind. As of January 2, 2026, Neuro-sama holds an estimated 162,459 active subscribers, according to TwitchTracker. That number places the channel far ahead of second-place streamer Jynxzi, who sits at just under 74,000 subscribers.Neuro-sama is the creation of Vedal, a computer programmer who built the VTuber using Unity and C#, with the AI systems developed in Python. Unlike regular chatbots, Neuro-sama can carry on conversations, sing, react to videos, and play games. She can stream almost around the clock, 24/7, offering viewers constant engagement, and not experiencing any kind of fatigue like normal streamers.According to the Neuro-sama wiki, “All of her movements, speech, and gameplay are powered by different generative AI systems to emulate a human streamer’s actions and interactions with her viewers.”With subscriptions valued at $5 each, not counting ads, bits, donations, or sponsorships, the channel is likely generating over $400,000 per month from subscriptions alone.Jynxzi addressed the surprising achievement on a recent stream when he became aware he had been taken over, saying, “You’re saying Vedal987 is not real? I’ve never even heard of that. That is the future of streaming bro. Dude, I’m bewildered bro. Game is game, I guess. 158,000 gifted subscriptions to an artificial intelligence VTuber that non-stop, 24/7 streams.”Neuro-Sama first appeared in 2019 as a simple osu! bot before being relaunched in late 2022 as a full-fledged VTuber.

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon musk has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

Melinda French Gates credits her career to IBM hiring manager





Melinda French Gates is one of the wealthiest women in America but her path to a $17.4 billion fortune began with an unusual advice from hiring manager at IBM . A hiring manager at the US-based multinational technology company told her to turn down the job, and instead join Microsoft that was relatively new at that time. French Gates interned at IBM for two summers, and was on the verge of accepting a full-time position with the company.During the conversation, she told the hiring manager that she had interviewed with a tiny company in Seattle, according to Fortune.“My hiring manager at IBM, a female, said to me, ‘Okay, are you ready to accept the job offer?’ And I said, ‘Well, I have one more company to go interview—this little company, Microsoft. It was tiny,” French Gates said during an interview.“And she said, ‘If they give you an offer, you should take it.’ And it dumbfounded me,” she added.The manager’s reason was clear: She reportedly said that a young recruit would have the better chance to move up quickly at Microsoft as it was growing rapidly.French Gates took the leap and moved to the West Coast in Seattle.“I didn’t know anybody in Seattle. It was moving to the West Coast, but I was so excited about what they were doing.I was like, ‘I want to be part of that,’” she said. French Gates spent nine years at Microsoft and became the General Manager of Information Products. She was a critical architect of the company’s expansion, which is now a $3.6 trillion software titan.Reflecting on her journey, French Gates now uses her story to encourage other women.“I remind them all the time you can pivot careers. You can change. It’s not like one or two paths that carry you forward, even though you had plans before this,” she said.“Here’s this woman who’s supposed to be my manager, giving me a piece of career advice,” French Gates said.",Melinda french gates is one of the wealthiest women in america.

Ji Yichao, the 32-year-old chief scientist and co-founder of Manus, shared two photographs on X showing younger versions of himself and Zuckerberg working on laptops in the same room at the ""Facebook House"" in Palo Alto, California. ""21 years ago and 13 years ago, two dropouts in this same room set out on their own journeys. Today, those paths merge,"" Ji wrote following acquisition announcement.According to Chinese media reports, Ji started a computer science degree at Beijing Information Science and Technology University in 2010 but dropped out to pursue entrepreneurship. He later returned to complete his degree in 2018. Zuckerberg famously left Harvard University in 2004 to focus on building Facebook, which eventually became Meta.The deal includes a $500 million retention pool for Manus employees, as Meta ramps up its foray into AI. Manus will be retained as a stand-alone subscription service while weaving in the startup's technology into Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.Manus, which debuted in March 2024 as a ""general-purpose"" AI agent capable of independently conducting deep research and vacation planning, and even coding and stock analysis, reached more than $100 million in annual recurring revenue in less than a year and gained millions of users.That deal is also not without geopolitical nuances, given that Manus was founded by Butterfly Effect in Beijing and Wuhan in 2022. Still, it moved to Singapore in mid-2025, apparently to hedge against geopolitical risk as part of the U.S.–China tech rivalry.Meta says there will be “no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI” after the acquisition, adding it would wind down services in China. Manus reportedly laid off most of its Chinese staff and now operates with 105 employees across Singapore, Tokyo, and San Francisco.Earlier, Senator John Cornyn had criticised Silicon Valley venture firm Benchmark for its support of Manus, citing fears of American capital underpinning Chinese technology interests.","Meta's $2.5 billion acquisition of ai startup manus sees co-founder ji yichao drawing parallels with mark zuckerberg, both college dropouts who built tech empires.

American billionaire and Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban has revealed that he avoids phone calls altogether. As reported by Fortune, in a TikTok video posted by Masterclass, Cuban said, “No, I don’t do calls. You know, I’ll engage with you via email, and trust me, I do this all the time. I’m really good at it.” He further explained that emails enable him to craft a more thoughtful responses and also helps him in preventing from forgetting details midst his bust schedule. “I’ll give you more comprehensive responses than if it was via phone,” he noted, adding that emails also provide a searchable record of conversations.Cuban’s stance echoes a broader generational trend. Many Gen Zers prefer email or text over calls, but for different reasons. A 2024 study found nearly a quarter of the generation avoids answering phone calls entirely, often due to telephobia — a form of phone anxiety that can trigger physical symptoms such as nausea, shaking, and difficulty concentrating.Talking to Business Insider, Billionaire Mark Cuban revealed that his daily routine is not at all exciting rather it’s quite boring. “I read and respond to emails,"" he wrote in an email.""I work out. I read and respond to emails. I do a couple Zooms. Then I read and respond to emails. Then I eat dinner. Then I read and respond to emails,” Cuban told BI.He revealed that his day starts with a decaf coffee and a cookie. He then takes her daughter to school and after that he works out at Life Time Fitness. Once done with the fitness regimen he again dives into his inbox. Despite his wealth, Cuban refuses to hire an assistant to manage his email, saying it would only “slow things down.”“I receive around 700 emails a day and use three phones (two Android and one iPhone) to manage everything. I'd rather get 700 to 1,000 emails than sit in long, boring meetings,” Cuban told BI.He emphasised that emails work for him because they come with searchable history. He also use Gmail’s auto-replies for 10–20% of messages. Cuban also mentioned that that in order to stay focused he keeps the unread emails under 20.Cuban rarely disconnects from email—even on vacation. “It’s faster to just get it out of the way,” he said. Only family events or emergencies prompt him to step away from his inbox for more than a few hours.While some may find his routine monotonous, Cuban sees it as a strategic advantage.","Billionaire mark cuban reveals his daily routine in a tiktok video posted by masterclass. “i read and respond to emails,"" he wrote in an email.

The company faces lawsuits over alleged harm caused by ChatGPT, while its safety teams have been disbanded. This new role aims to balance rapid AI advancement with crucial safeguards, a challenging task given the technology's unprecedented capabilities and potential dangers.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

Safety teams keep vanishing as products multiply

Lawsuits paint darker picture of AI's mental health toll





The man who unleashed ChatGPT on the world is now sounding the alarm about his own creation. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is hunting for a Head of Preparedness to tackle what he calls ""real challenges"" emerging from AI systems that have grown so sophisticated they're finding critical security vulnerabilities and impacting users' mental health. The $555,000 role comes as the company that revolutionised generative AI in late 2022 grapples with lawsuits, safety team departures, and the uncomfortable reality that its technology may be causing genuine harm.""Models are improving quickly and are now capable of many great things, but they are also starting to present some real challenges,"" Altman wrote on X. He didn't sugarcoat the position's demands, warning applicants: ""This will be a stressful job and you'll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately.""The new hire will lead OpenAI's preparedness framework, evaluating frontier AI capabilities and coordinating safeguards across cybersecurity, biosecurity, and the prospect of AI systems that can improve themselves—challenges that Altman admits have ""little precedent."" The company specifically needs help figuring out ""how to enable cybersecurity defenders with cutting edge capabilities while ensuring attackers can't use them for harm.The job opening arrives amid a disturbing pattern at OpenAI: safety teams appear, then disappear. The company's Superalignment team, launched in 2023 with the mission of preventing AI systems ""much smarter than us"" from going rogue, lasted less than a year before being disbanded in May 2024. Co-leader Jan Leike quit with a blistering exit statement, declaring that ""safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products. ""The AGI Readiness team met a similar fate in October 2024, dissolved after advising on the company's preparedness for artificial general intelligence. Meanwhile, Aleksander Madry, OpenAI's previous Head of Preparedness, was reassigned in July 2024 to work on AI reasoning instead—leaving the crucial safety position vacant for months even as the technology advanced.The urgency behind the new position becomes clearer when examining the lawsuits piling up against OpenAI. Multiple families allege ChatGPT reinforced delusions, deepened isolation, and even encouraged suicide. One case involves a 16-year-old California boy; another centers on a 56-year-old Connecticut man who allegedly murdered his mother and killed himself after interactions with the chatbot that fueled his paranoid delusions.OpenAI says it's working to improve ChatGPT's ability to ""recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress,"" but the company hasn't slowed its product velocity. Despite Altman's 2023 signing of a letter warning that AI extinction risks deserve priority alongside ""pandemics and nuclear war,"" OpenAI keeps accelerating. The company, now valued at $157 billion after October's $6.6 billion funding round, is reportedly negotiating with Amazon for another investment exceeding $10 billion.That contradiction—tech leaders prophesying catastrophe while racing to build the very technology they fear—hasn't gone unnoticed. ""If they honestly believe this could bring about human extinction, then why not just stop?"" asked one critic after Altman's Congressional testimony. The new Head of Preparedness will inherit that impossible balancing act: making AI safer while the company that employs them pushes relentlessly forward.","Openai's sam altman seeks a high-stakes 'head of preparedness' to address ai's growing security risks and mental health impacts.

The IIT rejection redirected his life towards a path only few could have imagined and which eventually led him to become the CEO of Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable companies. Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software. Nadella further added that like many of friends he also viewed IIT as the pinnacle of academic achievement. But when he failed to secure admission, Nadella faced a setback that could have easily defined his future.

Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there. However, all these experiences helped him in building adaptability which later went ahead and defined his leadership style.Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992, after working at Sun Microsystems.

Apple may skip iPhone 18 launch in 2026: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-may-skip-iphone-18-launch-in-2026-report/articleshow/126298730.cms,"Apple's Foldable iPhone is Coming, Here’s Why it Matters

Why iPhone 18 may not launch in 2026





Apple iPhone 18 standard model may not launch this year, says a new report by MacRumours. Other models under the iPhone 18 series – iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max are likely to have the usual launch timeline and are expected to come in September 2026. As per the report, the Cupertino-based company may unveil its first foldable ‌iPhone‌ during the fall event.“For more than a decade, Apple has introduced its mainline ‌iPhone‌ lineup in the fall, with all core models launching simultaneously in September,” MacRumors reported. “That pattern is expected to change this year, when the company is widely rumored to split its upcoming ‌iPhone‌ releases across two distinct release windows rather than unveiling the entire lineup at once. Under this strategy, Apple is expected to prioritize higher-end models in the fall while delaying lower-cost or standard models until the following year,” the report says.According to the report, iPhone 18 may not arrive until the spring of 2027, leaving the ‌iPhone 17‌ “as the latest standard model for over 18 months.” To recall, iPhone 17 debuted in September 2025 along with other iPhone 17 series models. “This would mark the first time Apple skips an entire calendar year without releasing a new generation of its flagship non-Pro ‌iPhone‌,” it says.MacRumours says that the rumoured change is likely due to Apple’s expanding iPhone lineup. Apple introduced iPhone 16e and iPhone Air last year. The company is rumoured to bring its first foldable iPhone in 2026. With the continued presence of iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, there could be at least eight iPhone models on sale by the end of 2026 (considering Apple’s next iPhone lineup continues to include – iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max and iPhone 18).“A staggered release schedule would allow the company to further differentiate its models, give them a longer sales window without internal competition, and spread ‌iPhone‌ launches more evenly across the year,” the report says.According to supply chain analysts, the rumoured shift will also result in manufacturing and logistics benefits for the iPhone maker. “By spacing out launches, Apple could reduce production bottlenecks, better manage component supply for advanced technologies, and smooth revenue recognition across fiscal quarters rather than concentrating ‌iPhone‌ sales in a single period,” the report adds.","Apple iphone 18 standard model may not launch this year, says a new report by macrumours.

Meta AI chief Alexandr Wang says will have kids only after Elon Musk’s Neuralink …,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meta-ai-chief-alexandr-wang-says-will-have-kids-only-after-elon-musks-neuralink-/articleshow/126263932.cms,"Here’s what Alexandr Wang said about Elon Musk's Neuralink

“Billionaire Alexandr Wang says he wants to wait to have kids until Neuralink is very advanced, because children’s brains in the first seven years are more flexible and can learn brain-computer interfaces, unlocking more potential than adult brains

Speaking on a podcast, Wang explained that he wants to wait until Neuralink or similar BCI technology is reliable and widely available. His reasoning is that children born into such a world could integrate the technology directly into their developing brains, rather than having to adapt to it later in life

He pointed to neuroplasticity, the brain’s heightened ability to form neural connections in early childhood, arguing that during the first ~7 years, children could learn to use brain-computer interfaces in ways adults simply cannot

At a deeper level, Wang’s comments reflect a broader concern: artificial intelligence is advancing at an exponential pace, while human biological evolution is slow. He suggests that direct neural links to AI may eventually be necessary for humans to remain cognitively competitive in a future shaped by superintelligence.”

“It's never an easy decision to say goodbye to colleagues. These are talented people who have worked extremely hard and contributed to our Al effort. Anyone in North America whose role was impacted has already been notified. Those who may be impacted in EMEA have been notified and remain subject to consultation,” Wang said.

“This by no means signals any decrease in investment. In fact, we will continue to hire industry-leading Al-native talent. Our goal is to enable MSL to move faster. We remain excited about the models we are training, our ambitious compute plans, and the products we are building, and I'm confident in our path to superintelligence,” he added.





Alexandr Wang, the head of Meta’s artificial intelligence division — SuperIntelligence Labs has now gave a new statement on his plans of having kids. Speaking at The Shawn Rayan Show, Wang said that he wait until Elon Musk ’s Neuralink or similar brain‑computer interface (BCI) technology is highly advanced before having children. Wang is of the opinion that child neuroplasticity offers the best window for adopting brain‑computer interfaces, and that future generations could grow up learning to use superintelligence tools intuitively. “I’ll have kids after Neuralink is very advanced, because children’s brains in the first seven years are more flexible and can learn brain-computer interfaces, unlocking more potential than adult brains,” said Wang.Tesla CEO Elon Musk founded Neuralink is presently conducting clinical trials and is working at restoring mobility for patients with paralysis. Musk has long promoted the idea of expanding the technology to enhance human cognition. Wang’s remarks highlight how some tech leaders see BCIs not just as medical tools, but as essential upgrades for future generations.Meta Superintelligence Lab (MSL), the billion-dollar team that Mark Zuckerberg created to take on Google and OpenAI in artificial intelligence (AI), is hiring. Alexandr Wang, the head of the team and Chief AI officer of Meta, has announced that the company is hiring for its team in Singapore. This comes hours after the social media giant acquired Manus AI, a Singapore-based company working on AI agents.“MSL is hiring in Singapore!

Indiana State Representative Andrew Ireland has criticised Purdue University Northwest for filing an H-1B visa to hire a foreign national as an assistant professor of marketing, starting June 2026 at a salary of $127,500.The Republican called the move unfair to American workers and questioned whether there were qualified US applicants nearby in Chicago.In a post on X, he said: ""Taxpayer-funded Purdue University disclosed it is hiring a foreigner on an H-1B visa to teach marketing.""Andrew also added: ""Does anyone seriously believe no American in the Chicago area can teach marketing for $127,500 a year?

According to USCIS data, Purdue filed 265 H-1B Labor Condition Applications in fiscal year 2025, with 258 approved.H-1B visas are intended for “specialty occupations” where no qualified Americans are available. But MAGA critics and 'America First' propagators argue that in fields such as marketing, software engineering, and data science, there is an abundance of domestic talent.However, last year, leaders like President Donald Trump, ex-DOGE leaders Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy have defended H1-B visas as a necessary source to attract the best and talented people from around the globe.USCIS statistics for fiscal year 2024 show 399,395 H-1B petitions approved nationwide, a 3 per cent increase from the previous year. Educational institutions accounted for 5.6 per cent of approvals.

This, in turn, limits opportunities for US graduates who want to apply to Ivy League institutions.In another social media interaction, Andrew was told by a user that universities hire the best people irrespective of their origins: ""Universities try to hire the best person for the job, regardless of whether he is American or foreign.

A new horizon for political style?

Designer perspectives and global relevance of Zohran Mamdani's style

The takeaway: Zohran Mamdani's style with substance





As the new mayor of New York City, Zohran Mamdani , took the oath on January 1, 2026, headlines across politics and culture praised his historic win. Yet one detail stood out in fashion circles, long after the ceremonies ended and it was the Assamese eri silk tie that he chose to wear.In an era where political figures increasingly use fashion as a form of cultural expression and personal storytelling, Mamdani’s choice became more than a sartorial statement. It became a symbol of identity, heritage and global style influence.While many inaugurations lean toward traditional Western tailoring that includes navy suits, plain ties and crisp white shirts, Mamdani’s look introduced a multilayered narrative. The tie, crafted from eri silk, highlighted a fabric traditionally woven in the Indian state of Assam, prized for its rich texture, subtle sheen and ethical production methods.Unlike the more commonly known mulberry silk, eri silk comes from a variety of silkworm that feed on castor leaves, making the textile cruelty-free and environmentally considerate, a factor that aligns with sustainability trends steadily gaining ground in fashion.This was not just a random sartorial choice. Mamdani’s tie became a fashion headline because it represented a fusion of regional craftsmanship with metropolitan elegance, a bridge between local tradition and global modernity.What made Mamdani’s sartorial choice even more resonant in fashion and cultural circles was the story behind the tie itself. For his swearing-in, Mamdani wore the custom, gold-embroidered tie made from Assamese eri silk by New Delhi menswear label Kartik Research, founded by designer Kartik Kumra.The brand is celebrated for its artisanal approach and engagement with Indian craft traditions. The delicate four-petal floral motifs on the herringbone necktie nodded subtly to Assamese weaving techniques, bringing India’s Northeast textile heritage into one of the most photographed civic moments of the year.Styled by Gabriella Karefa-Johnson, Mamdani’s incorporation of eri silk, also known as ahimsa or non-violent silk, produced across Assam, Meghalaya and Nagaland, was not just a fashion choice. It was a quiet celebration of craftsmanship and sustainable, culturally rooted design on the global stage.In fashion today, heritage and cultural craftsmanship are increasingly prized. Designers and stylists have been tapping into artisanal textiles not only for their aesthetic appeal but also for the stories they carry. From Japanese kasuri to African kente cloth, fashion tastemakers are spotlighting local techniques with global resonance.Mamdani’s eri silk tie tapped right into this moment. Wearing it to one of the most photographed public ceremonies in the world was not just stylish, it was a fashion-forward cultural assertion.The tie captured attention of fashion commentariat and soon enough, social media platforms lit up as it defied inauguration norms. Most political wardrobe choices stay safely within neutral palettes but Mamdani's eri silk tie with its subtle texture and cultural depth stood out as refreshingly distinctive yet still elegant and dignified.It spotlighted sustainable materials. In an industry increasingly focused on ecological impact, silk alternatives and ethically produced textiles are trending. Eri silk’s cruelty-free provenance resonates with consumers and designers alike. The tie also offered a narrative depth as fashion has moved beyond aesthetics to storytelling. Mamdani’s tie was a conversation starter about identity, heritage and inclusive representation, all within a highly photographed, global moment.Political wardrobes have long been dissected for symbolism, from Michelle Obama’s designer choices to Barack Obama’s flag-pin ties. Mamdani’s eri silk accessory suggests that global political figures are now embracing authentic, culturally specific fashion as part of their public persona.This shift parallels developments in contemporary fashion, which is a move away from homogenous corporate dress codes and towards diversity, narrative and craft. It is not merely about looking good but showing something meaningful.Fashion insiders noted that such statements resonate especially in 2026, an era where cultural heritage is increasingly integrated into luxury fashion lines. Sustainability is a non-negotiable value among fashion consumers and global audiences expect public figures to reflect diversity and depth in personal style. The eri silk tie did exactly that, acting as a small yet powerful medium for cross-cultural dialogue.In a world saturated with trending garments and seasonal must-haves, it is rare for a single accessory at a political moment to generate genuine fashion buzz. Zohran Mamdani’s Assamese eri silk tie achieved that, not because it was flashy but because it was intentional with a thoughtful blend of culture, sustainability and modern elegance.","The assamese silk tie of zohran mamdani that quietly stole the spotlight at nyc’s mayor swearing-in is being called the most meaningful fashion moment of 2026.
