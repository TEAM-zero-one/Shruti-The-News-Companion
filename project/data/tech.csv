Wipro changes work from office rules: Employees asked to work at least 6 hours from office; check details of new policy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/wipro-changes-work-from-office-rules-employees-asked-to-work-at-least-6-hours-from-office-check-details-of-new-policy/articleshow/126369133.cms,"Wipro will continue to allow for temporary remote working, but the allowable number of such days has been reduced to 12 from 15 in a calendar year.

Wipro’s New Work From Office Rules Effective January 2026

Indian IT Sector’s Work From Office Rules

IT services giant Wipro has tweaked its work from office policy, putting in more stringent checks for employees. The new rules require employees to stay in the office at least six hours. Wipro is currently following a hybrid work model under which employees are mandated to work from the office at least three days in a week. The Bengaluru-based company, which employs around 234,000 people, rolled out the updated policy with effect from January 1, 2026.Although the requirement to attend office three days a week has been in effect for some time, the stipulation of a six-hour minimum stay, measured between entry and exit punches, is a new element of the company’s hybrid work framework in India.Employees who do not meet the weekly attendance requirement will see their leaves being deducted accordingly. Additionally, those who spend fewer than six hours in the office on a mandated day will see a half-day leave deduction, according to an ET report.Wipro will continue to allow for temporary remote working, but the allowable number of such days has been reduced to 12 from 15 in a calendar year. These days can be used for personal health needs, illness, or caregiving responsibilities.Communicating the changes through a recent internal email, the company said hybrid work remains central to its future workplace strategy. “We trust all associates will follow the policy in both letter and spirit as it supports collaboration across teams while providing flexibility,” the email reportedly said.The communication also clarified that the six-hour requirement refers only to the minimum duration of office presence and not the total daily working time, which continues to be 9.5 hours. Employees are expected to complete the remaining working hours from home on the same day and ensure delivery of assigned tasks.The changes to work from office rules come as the $283 billion information technology industry faces sluggish topline growth, with the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence beginning to erode its traditional people-led delivery model.According to industry experts, increasingly tight project schedules and the need for closer coordination have pushed technology companies to scale back remote work and emphasise in-person collaboration.“Earlier, applications used to be rolled out every two or three years. Now, the way software is designed and coded is different, with applications being rolled out in as little as eight weeks. So, with upgrades getting faster, people have to collaborate and work much quicker, which makes remote working inefficient,” said Guruprasad Srinivasan, executive director at staffing firm Quess Corp.He added that while routine, process-driven activities such as accounting, data handling and legal services can still be carried out independently, product development and project execution, often referred to as transformational work, require teams to be physically present to improve turnaround time and output quality.India’s largest IT services provider, Tata Consultancy Services, introduced a five-day-a-week office attendance policy last year. The framework allows employees to work from home for two days a month in case of health-related issues. It has also tied variable compensation to office attendance, with full payouts applicable for attendance above 85%, reduced payouts for lower levels, and no variable pay for attendance below 60%.Although TCS mandates a nine-hour workday at the office, its monitoring system sends alerts only when an employee’s office presence falls short of four hours. Infosys , the country’s second-largest IT firm with a staff strength exceeding 300,000, announced its return-to-office policy on November 20, 2023. Under the policy, employees at job level 5 and below are required to work from office for at least 10 days each month.","Wipro is currently following a hybrid work model under which employees are mandated to work from the office at least three days in a week.

BENGALURU: India’s first space mission for 2026 will launch a defence satellite built by the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), a satellite for ministry of external affairs (MEA) to be used by Nepal, test on-orbit refuelling technology of a Bengaluru-based startup, aside from 13 other satellites, including foreign ones from UK, France and Brazil.The launch of PSLV-C62 mission, Isro said, is scheduled for January 12 at 10.17 am from the first launch pad (FLP) of the Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) in Sriharikota. The main satellite the mission will launch is DRDO’s Anvesha, also called EOS-N1.EOS-N1 is designed to provide the Indian military with advanced, unprecedented surveillance advantages over adversaries. The hyperspectral imaging payload can analyse light in hundreds of wavelengths to identify the materials an object is made of, a capability beyond the human eye.While this satellite is expected to bridge the gap in strategic surveillance to some degree, the mission will also launch AyulSAT, built by Bengaluru’s OrbitAID Aerospace, which if successful will be the first step towards India demonstrating the crucial on-orbit refuelling technology which will have far-reaching benefits.OrbitAID founder and CEO Sakthikumar Ramachandran terms AayulSAT more than a mission. “...It’s the foundation of the on-orbit economy,” he says, while the company says: “Years from now, this won’t be remembered as a launch but as the moment India made space serviceable. From India to the world!”A third important satellite will be Munal, built by Nepal’s Antharkshya Pratishtan with help from India’s ministry of external affairs (MEA).It is intended to carry an Earth observation payload to support environmental monitoring and capacity building, marking another step in Nepal’s entry into space-based applications.Aside from these three, the mission will put into orbit 13 more satellites, including five — CGUSAT, DSUSAT, MOI-1, LACHIT and DR-1 — by Indian startup Dhruva Space. They will demonstrate or validate multiple technologies, including indigenous satellite bus capabilities and subsystems, communication and payload subsystems in low Earth orbit, multi-payload integration and operational performance of larger CubeSat platforms, basic satellite operations and communication links, etc.Foreign satellites on the mission include five satellites by Brazil’s AlltoSpace, Theos-2 from SSTL, UK, and KID Capsule by RIDE, France. The five satellites from Brazil are EduSat, Uaisat, Galaxy Explorer, Orbital Temple, and Aldebaran-1. The last is a CubeSat called Sanskarsat by Laxman Gyanpith, India.All satellites have been contracted through Space PSU NewSpace India Limited (Nsil), the commercial arm of the department of space.","The launch of pslv-c62 mission is scheduled for january 12 at 10.17 am from the first launch pad (flp) of the satish dhawan space centre (sdsc) in sriharikota.

Delhi’s Air Pollution Gets Attention, But Most Indian Cities Are As Bad Or Worse | I Witness

NEW DELHI: Taking, in what it called, an important step towards environmental governance and reducing dependence on foreign certification systems, India has set up the world’s second National Environmental Standard Laboratory here at the CSIR–National Physical Laboratory (NPL) that will develop requisite testing and calibration facilities for air pollution monitoring equipment in the country.Currently, most of the instruments used in India for air pollution monitoring are imported. These imported instruments, however, come with production certification from international agencies based on the environmental conditions of the certificate issuing countries.Since environmental conditions of those countries are very different from the conditions prevalent in India, it affects the quality of measurements by the instrument operating for a long time in Indian conditions, CSIR scientists explained. At present, only the UK has such a laboratory.The National Environmental Standard Laboratory, inaugurated by Union science & technology minister Jitendra Singh on 80th Foundation Day celebrations of CSIR–NPL on Monday, will now not only deal with the anomaly arising out of different environmental conditions but also help in manufacturing of standardised monitoring equipment.Domestic production of such instruments will eventually end India’s dependence on import and make it an exporting nation of such equipment to third world countries.The global market value of air pollution monitoring systems is, currently, estimated at $3,997 million.In addition, Singh also inaugurated the National Primary Standard Facility for Solar Cell Calibration, bringing India among a select group of global leaders in photovoltaic measurement standards. Both these facilities will enhance trust in data and drive investment in pollution monitoring and renewable energy.Describing the National Environmental Standard Laboratory as a “critical step towards strengthening India’s environmental governance framework”, Singh said that reliable, India-specific calibration and certification of air pollution monitoring systems was long overdue and would now enable transparent, traceable, and accurate environmental data.The facility will support regulatory bodies, industries, and startups by ensuring that monitoring instruments are tested under Indian climatic conditions. It will thus improve policy enforcement of various schemes including the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP).Terming the facility for Solar Cell Calibration (Solar Energy Complex) a “future-ready facility”, Singh said it would reduce India’s dependence on foreign certification agencies, save foreign exchange, shorten turnaround time for calibration, and enhance investor confidence in the country’s rapidly expanding solar sector.","India has set up the world’s second national environmental standard laboratory.

MLB trade rumours: Cody Bellinger seeks six- or seven-year contract while New York Yankees prefer shorter commitment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/mlb-trade-rumours-cody-bellinger-seeks-six-or-seven-year-contract-while-new-york-yankees-prefer-shorter-commitment/articleshow/126405204.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Cody Bellinger and the New York Yankees exchange multiple offers

Cody Bellinger enters his age-30 season with most teams projecting a five- or six-year deal

Interest from other teams for Cody Bellinger





The New York Yankees are in talks with free agent outfielder Cody Bellinger during the 2025-2026 offseason, and the length of the contract is a major sticking point. It seems like they’re not close to a deal yet, but discussions are still ongoing. Bellinger and his agents at the Boras Corporation are probably aiming for a six- or seven-year contract.In a different segment on MLB Network, Jon Morosi mentioned that Bellinger is still looking for a deal around seven years, while the Yankees, as expected, are leaning towards a four- or five-year agreement. This deadlock comes as reports indicate that the Yankees have made at least two formal offers to Bellinger. General manager Brian Cashman has openly shown the team's desire to bring him back.Talks between Bellinger and the Yankees have moved forward with several offers on the table, but they still can’t agree on the contract length. Brendan Kuty mentioned in The Athletic that the length of the contract might be a sticking point, as Bellinger is looking for a deal of six or seven years. Jon Morosi also chimed in on MLB Network's Hot Stove, stating, ""I still in the long-run think Bellinger ends up a Yankee,"" while noting the back-and-forth discussions.Steve Phillips, also on MLB Network, reacted to the second offer by stating, “There's some back-and-forth which is a good sign for the Yankees... I still in the long-run think Bellinger ends up a Yankee.” Bryan Hoch, via SNYtv, reported, ""What I'm told is that there is a gap and it's years and AAV,” referring to average annual value as factors holding up the deal.Robert Murray mentioned that the Yankees and Bellinger aren't really close to making a deal, but New York is still the top contender to sign him. Jon Heyman talked about Bellinger's situation and other Yankees-related topics during a chat on Michael Kay's show that was shared on X.External forecasts give insight into the anticipated duration and worth of the deal. MLB Trade Rumors estimated that Bellinger would land a five-year, $140MM contract at the beginning of the offseason. Most predictions indicate a five- or six-year agreement, as Bellinger approaches his 30th birthday.There’s a history of players landing contracts of seven years or more at that age, but the last free agent hitter to achieve this was Brandon Nimmo in 2022. Since then, no free agent bat in his 30s has signed a six-year deal, although Alex Bregman turned down a six-year proposal from the Tigers last winter when he was a year older.Bobby Milone on X noted, ""Boras wants 7 years"" is correct (no one giving him that). I heard 30-32m was the max (Doubt anyone giving more). So 5/150-160m is the sweet spot and the Yankees are not there (Cause I doubt any other team is bidding).""Roman Savino replied on X, ""I admire Boras for thinking Cody could get 30-32m but last year the Cubs had to pay 5m to be able to trade him. Cody and Boras need to start to be realistic about what his market actually is.""Although the Yankees are leading the pack, other teams are also in the mix for Bellinger. The New York Mets have been frequently brought up. There's even talk about a potential reunion with the Cubs.There's a noticeable difference between what Bellinger wants and what teams are offering, with several reports saying he's looking for a deal of six or seven years.Considering the Yankees' offseason, Bellinger's negotiations might be affecting other decisions, like possible trades for starting pitchers such as Freddy Peralta or MacKenzie Gore, as Bobby Milone hinted on X, ""The holdup for Peralta or Gore might be Bellinger. As the Brewers and Nationals might want Dominguez or Jones in a deal. If Bellinger gets done, we could see quickly after a trade for a SP.""Jack Fungo on X added, ""I think they’re pressing to resolve the Bellinger situation first before engaging on the SP market.""The Yankees decided to give Trent Grisham a qualifying offer, which changed their compensation pick because of luxury tax rules. This move is linked to their negotiations with Bellinger, but they haven't come to an agreement yet, though talks are still ongoing.Also Read: Who is Reagan Bregman?

UAE offers ‘citizenship’ to businesses under New Corporate Law 2026,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-offers-citizenship-to-businesses-under-new-corporate-law-2026/articleshow/126389470.cms,"Under new 2026 Law, UAE makes businesses ‘Emirati’ / Image: file

UAE Corporate Citizenship Law 2026

Who does it apply to?

How does it benefit companies?

Stronger Global Identity: Being officially recognised as a UAE company enhances credibility and trust in international markets.

Preferential Trade Access: It allows companies to benefit more easily from trade agreements the UAE has signed with other countries through Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreements (CEPAs). These deals can reduce tariffs and ease cross-border trade.

Local Incentives: Companies with Emirati status can qualify for incentives that local governments may offer to domestic entities, including support programs and sector initiatives.

Attract global business

Multiple Share Classes: Allowing flexibility in ownership structures for both LLCs and joint stock companies.

Re-domiciliation Flexibility: Companies can move registration between emirates or free zones without losing their legal identity.

Explicit Rules for Mergers & Acquisitions: Easier guidance for shareholder exits and corporate restructuring.

New Non-Profit Commercial Company Types: Businesses can now incorporate for non-profit commercial purposes.





The UAE has introduced an important update to its Commercial Companies Law that officially grants “citizenship” status to companies established in the country. This doesn’t mean that owners or investors become Emirati citizens, rather, the company itself gains recognition as a UAE company under the law.According to Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri, Minister of Economy and Tourism, this provision applies to businesses formed anywhere in the UAE, including both mainland and free-zone companies. That means entities based in financial free zones now also enjoy full Emirati corporate identity.Officials stress that this move aligns the UAE with global corporate practices: just as a business registered in Germany is regarded as a German company, firms in the UAE will be recognised as Emirati companies under this law.The first thing to clear up is a common misconception: this law does not grant individual UAE citizenship to the owners or shareholders of a company.As clarified by Abdulla bin Touq Al Marri, the UAE Minister of Economy, the ""nationality"" belongs strictly to the legal entity itself.Think of it like this: if you open a company in London, it is a British company.In the UAE, the new law formalizes this relationship, ensuring that any business established here, whether on the mainland or within a financial free zone like the DIFC or ADGM, is recognized globally as a UAE-national entity.This move aligns the Emirates with international standards and strengthens the ""Brand UAE"" label for every product and service exported from the country.A key point emphasised by authorities is that this corporate citizenship does not extend to individual shareholders, investors, or founders. It strictly refers to the legal status of the company itself, not personal citizenship for people.This clarification came after questions emerged about whether foreign owners could seek Emirati citizenship with this provision, the answer is no. The benefit applies to the business entity only.The rule includes all types of incorporated companies, whether they operate on the UAE mainland or within free and financial free zones. This broad eligibility was specifically underscored to avoid confusion.This legal recognition as a UAE company brings multiple practical benefits:By reinforcing national identity for companies, the UAE aims to help businesses scale internationally while maintaining strong links back to the UAE economy.The corporate citizenship provision is part of a larger overhaul of the UAE’s Commercial Companies Law (Federal Decree‐Law No. 20 of 2025), which also includes modernising company structures and governance frameworks.Other reforms in the new law include:These changes are intended to make the UAE one of the world’s most attractive destinations for business growth, innovation, and foreign investment.The UAE’s corporate landscape has grown rapidly in recent years, with hundreds of thousands of new businesses launched. This legal update is designed to support that growth by strengthening companies’ roots within the UAE and enhancing their global competitiveness.By being officially recognised as Emirati companies, UAE-based firms will find it easier to leverage trade agreements, secure investment, and compete internationally, helping reinforce the UAE’s reputation as a global business hub","Under new 2026 law, uae makes businesses ‘emirati’ under new corporate citizenship law 2026. This doesn’t mean that owners or investors become emirati citizens, rather, the company itself gains recognition as a uae company under the law.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126389675,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-2683100,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

"What was Bryce Young net worth 2025: $12 Million, and the Panthers already cut the biggest check",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/what-was-bryce-young-net-worth-2025-12-million-and-the-panthers-already-cut-the-biggest-check/articleshow/126397287.cms,"Bryce Young’s money story in 2025 starts with a $24.6 million signing bonus and does not stop there. (Image via Getty)

Bryce Young’s Carolina Panthers rookie contract is the real engine of his 2025 money story

Bryce Young’s 2025 earnings were not just “good for a young QB,” they were locked in

Bryce Young’s endorsements were a second paycheck, and he started cashing it before the NFL

Bryce Young’s off-field money also came with a public “grown-up” lane

So, what was Bryce Young’s net worth in 2025?





Bryce Young’s net worth in 2025 was widely estimated at $12 million, with Celebrity Net Worth listed as a primary source for that figure. That number is an estimate. But the money tied to Young’s rookie deal with the Carolina Panthers explains why the estimate keeps landing in the same place across outlets.Young entered the league as the No. 1 overall pick in the 2023 NFL Draft, and his rookie contract looks like what you would expect from that slot. He signed a four-year deal worth $37,955,071, and it came with a $24,603,688 signing bonus.Here is the part people miss when they talk net worth like it is just “salary.” That signing bonus is the heavy lift. It is why Young’s career cash ramped up fast, even though his year-to-year base salaries on a rookie deal are relatively small.By the end of the 2025 season, Over the Cap listed Young’s career earnings at $32,029,381. That is the cleanest public explanation for why a $12 million net worth estimate does not sound wild, even if you treat it as a rough snapshot and not a bank statement.Young’s rookie deal is fully guaranteed per the major contract trackers, and that matters because it removes the “if he sticks” part that usually hovers over early-career money.It also sets up the next step. Young’s contract includes the standard rookie timeline where the big leverage moment is not Year 1. It is the point where the Panthers decide whether he is the long-term plan, and whether he plays himself into extension talks.Young did not wait for Sundays to become a brand. ESPN reported during his Alabama days that he was already approaching major endorsement money, with Nick Saban publicly noting how quickly that side was moving.Once he turned pro, the brand list only got louder. Public reporting has tied Young to deals and partnerships connected to major names like Jordan Brand, Snickers, and BODYARMOR, with multiple outlets covering that early push around the 2023 draft window.Other reporting around Young’s portfolio has included brands such as Bojangles and Lowe’s Home Improvement, which fits the obvious playbook for a Panthers quarterback living in Charlotte, N.C.A lot of players do ads. Fewer build a public identity that is not only product-based. In 2025, local Charlotte reporting spotlighted Young spending an off day talking with teens about mental health at HopeWay.HopeWay also listed an event connected to the Young 9 Foundation, tying the philanthropy side directly to mental wellness fundraising. That kind of visibility does two things at once. It supports the community work, and it keeps Young in the public eye without needing a viral clip or a manufactured headline.Based on widely circulated public estimates, Bryce Young’s net worth in 2025 was $12 million.The better way to frame it is this: the estimate tracks because Young already had (1) a No. 1 pick rookie deal with a massive signing bonus and (2) a real endorsement runway that started before he ever took an NFL snap.","Bryce young’s money story in 2025 starts with a $24.6 million signing bonus and does not stop there.

The 2025 NFL offseason fundamentally reshaped the league’s financial hierarchy. Fueled by a historic salary cap jump and an aggressive contract market, several star players experienced massive year-over-year increases in net worth, not gradually but almost overnight.From record-breaking guaranteed money to transformative off-field deals, these players didn’t just get paid, they entered a new financial tier. Here are the five NFL stars whose net worth increased the most from 2024 to 2025, based on contract guarantees, endorsement expansion, and reported business ventures.Estimated net worth increase (2024–2025): $40–60 millionJosh Allen’s financial leap in 2025 was driven by one of the most significant contracts in NFL history. In March 2025, Allen signed a six-year, $330 million extension, including a record $250 million in guaranteed money.That guarantee alone dramatically reshaped his net worth profile compared to 2024. Beyond his contract, Allen also expanded his endorsement portfolio, including a reported equity stake with New Era, signaling a shift toward long-term brand ownership rather than traditional sponsorships.Allen’s 2025 offseason marked the moment he moved from “highly paid quarterback” to financial cornerstone of the league.Estimated net worth increase: $35–50 millionMicah Parsons’ rise from elite defender to financial heavyweight accelerated rapidly in 2025. Following his high-profile move to Green Bay, Parsons signed a four-year, $188 million contract with $136 million guaranteed, placing him among the highest-paid defensive players in NFL history.Compared to 2024, when Parsons was still operating under a comparatively modest rookie-deal framework, the guaranteed money alone represents a massive net worth swing. His deal also reset expectations for non-quarterback stars in future negotiations.Parsons’ 2025 jump underscores how defensive superstars are finally being paid at quarterback-adjacent levels.Estimated net worth increase: $45–55 millionFew financial transformations in NFL history compare to Brock Purdy’s. After entering the league as “Mr. Irrelevant,” Purdy signed a five-year, $265 million contract in March 2025, instantly changing his long-term financial outlook.In 2024, Purdy’s net worth was limited by his rookie-scale contract.

The guaranteed money alone represents a dramatic net worth increase, even before endorsements and incentives are factored in.Chase’s deal reflects the NFL’s shifting economics, where elite pass catchers now command franchise-level financial commitment.The NFL salary cap jumped from $255.4 million in 2024 to $279.2 million in 2025, giving teams unprecedented flexibility to front-load guarantees and reset markets across positions.Unlike previous eras, 2025 contracts emphasized cash flow and guarantees, immediately impacting players’ net worth rather than spreading earnings over time.The biggest net worth increases from 2024 to 2025 weren’t just about playing well, they were about timing, leverage, and market evolution.

Investor concerns beyond Jeff Bezos







Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’, even he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society. Recently, speaking at the Italian Tech Week alongside Exor CEO John Elkann, Bezos said that the excitement around AI has led to unusual investor behaviour, with billions of dollars flowing into companies regardless strong fundamentals.Bezos explained that bubbles are characterised by inflated stock prices and a rush of funding into both good and bad ideas. This makes it difficult for the investor to distinguish.Bezos further outlined the hallmarks of bubbles. He said that the current AI climate as one where “every experiment or idea gets funded,” even if the fundamentals are weak. He pointed to unusual behavior such as small companies with only a handful of employees receiving billions of dollars in investment. This, he said, is a hallmark of industrial bubbles, where excitement drives capital into ventures indiscriminately.Despite this caution, Bezos feels that the technology itself is genuine and transformative. “AI is real, and it is going to change every industry,” he told the audience. He further compared the situation to the biotech bubble of the 1990s, which witnessed many companies fail but ultimately produced some life-saving drugs. Industrial bubbles, he argued, are not necessarily harmful; when the dust settles, society benefits from the inventions that survive.Bezos’ remarks echo a growing chorus of warnings from business leaders. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has previously said the AI market is in a bubble. At the same event in Turin, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon cautioned that investor excitement often overlooks risks, predicting a “reset” or “drawdown” in valuations. Similarly, Karim Moussalem, chief investment officer at Selwood Asset Management, recently said the AI trade is beginning to resemble “one of the great speculative manias of market history. ”","Amazon founder jeff bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’ however, even he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society.

Mark Cuban on biggest barrier for students





American billionaire and Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban said that students these days use artificial intelligence (AI) excessively to ask the “right questions”. However, he said that students should not rely much on AI. Instead, they must use AI to enhance their own critical-thinking skills, rather than replace them. “They use strong inputs and apply critical thinking to evaluate results,” he said adding “AI helps students think bigger, but it doesn’t make decisions”.In an interview with CNBC’s Make It last year, Cuban said that tomorrow’s leaders might be today’s AI-obsessed kids. “Students who use AI will produce better, more creative work and gain a collaborative relationship with technology that’s needed in the future workplace,” he said adding: “Students who use AI will be best equipped to lead.”During the interview, Mark Cuban said that “Access is the biggest barrier” to students being taught how to best use AI tools effectively and ethically at school. According to Samsung’s new Solve for Tomorrow 2025 AI Readiness Study, 80% of US teachers believe that learning AI skills is important for students’ success in the future. However, research shows that educators have expressed concern over misuse of AI tools to cheat, or that the information obtained from AI models will include errors that spread misinformation.But Cuban has asserted that students need to learn to use AI tools properly and productively. He has previously likened the current AI boom to past technological revolutions, particularly the rise of computers and the internet. “Spend as much time as possible familiarizing yourself with the latest AI tools and models, so you can impress future employers with your up-to-date prompt engineering and model customization skills,” an advice that he often gives to students, per a CNBC report.Speaking on an episode of the “TBPN” podcast in 2025, Mark Cuban said”“Every single company needs that. There is nothing intuitive for a company to integrate AI, and that’s what people don’t understand. That is going to be jobs left and right.”","Mark cuban said that students these days use artificial intelligence (ai) excessively to ask the “right questions” he said that they must use ai to enhance their own critical-thinking skills, rather than replace them. “ai helps students think bigger, but it doesn’t make decisions”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126352688,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-29300,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

EXPOSED: Mark Zuckerberg Embarrassed on Hot Mic Admitting Total Confusion During Trump Dinner





Ever since Mark Zuckerberg announced the creation of Meta Superintelligence Labs in first half of 2025, Meta CEO has been on an AI hiring blitz. A Twitter user who goes by the moniker @HinataMotivates, said to be a tech-motivation account, shared a podcast clip (going back to 2022) where Zuckerberg talks about Meta hiring rule and his advice for college students. Mark Zuckerberg has a hiring rule that he says is cardinal for him while hiring anyone and the one that he says is also an important tip for any college student. In an episode of the “Lex Fridman Podcast,” hosted by MIT computer scientist Lex Fridman, Zuckerberg said that most people know Facebook ’s dorm-room origin story and that many have learned the wrong lesson from it. He said that his initial ability to launch Facebook wasn’t because he dropped out of college. According to Zuckerberg, it was due to the personal connections he made while he was still in school.Who you spend time with in college, Zuckerberg said, is “the most important decision” any student can make in college. He advised college students that choosing their social circle is the most pivotal decision, as people tend to emulate those around them. “You become the people you surround yourself with,” he said in the podcast.“I think probably people are too, in general, objective focused, and maybe not focused enough on the connections and the people who they’re basically building relationships [with]. ” Meta CEO Zuckerberg is said to have met his Facebook co-founders ⁠— Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes and Andrew McCollum ⁠— while the five were students at Harvard University.While the group split up in a not-so-happy manner, Zuckerberg said on the podcast that he tries to prioritize relationships over objectives. This applies especially to hiring. Zuckerberg said that he extends the idea to his Meta hiring philosophy: He only employs candidates he did hypothetically work for, underscoring reciprocity and alignment in professional networks. When evaluating a job candidate, he imagines what it would be like to work for that person. “I will only hire someone to work for me if I can see myself working for them,” he said.Mark Zuckerberg said that the strategy creates a work environment that’s both more cohesive and more productive: If you work with people who share your values on a human level, you’ll be more likely to smoothly achieve your work goals together. It’s all about finding personal compatibility, he said, not unlike “choosing friends or a partner.”","Mark zuckerberg has a hiring rule that he says is cardinal for him while hiring anyone.

""

""Over time, the success rate of this is four out of five, where they come out of it,”





Deepinder Goyal, founder and CEO of Zomato 's parent company Eternal, has revealed that he asked Albinder Dhindsa to step down from his role twice shortly after the food delivery service acquired Blinkit. Goyal explained that this move was part of his tough leadership reset method. Speaking on a video podcast with Raj Shamani, Goyal noted that these conversations took place soon after the acquisition of the quick commerce startup, when Dhindsa was struggling to adapt to the changes required after the integration.Goyal said on the podcast.These remarks offer a rare public look at how Goyal handles senior leadership changes at Eternal, which owns both Zomato and Blinkit, especially when founders or top executives need to adapt to a new company structure after an acquisition. Goyal explained his leadership style involves extended periods of coaching, but if no progress is made, he confronts the person directly.he noted.The situation reveals the challenges that can arise when successful startup founders join larger organisations through acquisitions and must adjust their working style to fit the new company's expectations.Describing what he calls aphase, Goyal said he sometimes purposely breaks down a leader's confidence to make them start fresh.he explained.According to Goyal, this method has worked most of the time.he added.However, Goyal did not confirm whether Dhindsa's job or duties officially changed during this time. Still, his comments show how intense the process was of bringing Blinkit into Eternal, especially as the company was growing both Blinkit and Zomato while facing more competition in quick commerce.Zomato bought Blinkit, which was previously known as Grofers, in 2022 for Rs 4,447 crore, or about $568 million at the time, in an all-stock deal. This marked Zomato's official entry into India's rapidly growing quick commerce business. Since buying the company, Blinkit has become a key growth area for Eternal, opening many new stores and handling more and more orders.","Deepinder goyal, founder and ceo of zomato's parent company eternal, has revealed that he asked albinder dhindsa to step down from his role twice shortly after the acquisition of blinkit.

OpenAI cofounder disagrees with CEO Sam Altman on AGI timeline





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently shared what he sees as a key test for the next stage of artificial intelligence (AI). As companies race to build AI agents that can act independently, Suleyman said he is watching for a milestone he calls Artificial Capable Intelligence (ACI) on the path toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). He said that the test is simple in context but difficult in execution – whether an AI agent can legally take $1,00,000 and turn it into $1 million. He described the test as “modern turing test”, suggesting it will show how AI systems can plan, reason, make decisions and operate within real-word rules.“The next big milestone I'm watching for on our way to AGI: Artificial Capable Intelligence (ACI). Can an agent take $100k and legally turn it into $1M? To me that's the modern Turing Test,” Mustafa Suleyman wrote in a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter).Suleyman’s comments come as several technology leaders including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff bet heavily on AI agents as the next major shift in enterprise software. Companies such as OpenAI, Salesforce, Microsoft and others are promoting agents that can carry out tasks with limited human input, from writing code to managing business workflows.Last year, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff called the rise of AI in the workforce a “digital labor revolution,” estimating that the software company has reached about 93% accuracy with the technology.In an interview with Bloomberg then, he revealed that AI is doing up to 50% of the work at Salesforce.In 2025, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicted that AI could soon automate up to 40% of the tasks humans currently perform. He also claimed that AGI could arrive before 2030.Recently, OpenAI cofounder and AI researcher Andrej Karpathy pushed back against the “agentic AI” hype, characterizing the current generation of autonomous AI systems as “slop.” Karpathy has directly challenged the notion that autonomous AI agents are on the cusp of delivering as promised, positioning himself in contrast to the optimistic timelines often suggested by figures like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.“I feel like the industry is making too big of a jump and is trying to pretend like this is amazing, and it’s not. It’s slop,"" Karpathy said on The Dwarkesh Podcast.“They’re not coming to terms with it, and maybe they’re trying to fundraise or something like that. We’re at this intermediate stage,” he added.","Microsoft ai ceo mustafa suleyman proposes a new test for advanced ai: can an agent legally grow $100,000 into $1 million?

Getting real with AI by tracking audited metrics is the need of the hour for IT firms. While companies highlighted aggressive AI adoption by giving out the percentages of new code generated by AI and workforce skilling metrics, audited financial data that presents the real productivity impact is yet to fully show up. A comparison of productivity metrics since 2020 shows that the much-touted AI push did not deliver a step-change in per-employee economics across global and Indian IT services firms. This is despite revenue growth being supported by M&A-led expansion and a sharply depreciating rupee, raising questions around the pace of underlying organic growth.Overall, the top 10 Indian IT services firms spent about $4.3 billion on acquisitions over the same period, underscoring the sector’s reliance on M&A to bolster growth. Infosys HCL Tech, and Wipro spent about $1 billion to acquire 7 companies in the first 9 months of the current fiscal. In 2024, Cognizant made two major acquisitions, including its second largest ever—the $1.3 billion purchase of US engineering R&D firm Belcan—along with the $430 million acquisition of ServiceNow partner Thirdera. More recently, it acquired 3Cloud to strengthen its Azure capabilities. Further, companies also became aggressive with large deals, promising ever-higher productivity gains and driving revenue growth by booking licence sales of software products such as Salesforce and Workday in their books to boost the revenue line.The data, compiled from a LinkedIn post by Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, partner at growth advisory firm Catalincs, compares pre- and post-pandemic productivity metrics, particularly after the launch of ChatGPT in November 2022. Accenture’s revenue per employee rose only marginally from $86,191 in August 2020 to $89,408 in August 2025, despite averaging more than a dozen acquisitions annually. EBIT per employee increased by just 3.6% over the same period. Notably, Accenture—one of the first firms to explicitly disclose AI revenue—said it will no longer report AI revenues separately, citing the deep embedding of AI across its core offerings rather than standalone projects.Among Indian peers, Infosys shows the strongest structural improvement, with revenue per employee rising from $53,591 in September 2020 to $59,297 in September 2025, though EBIT and net profit per employee remain largely flat. TCS recovered from its post-pandemic dip, lifting revenue per employee from $47,434 to $50,380, but EBIT per employee is only marginally above 2020 levels. In contrast, TCS recently called out AI revenue for the first time, with CEO K Krithivasan saying AI services reached $1.5 billion in annualised revenue, growing 16.3% quarter-on-quarter. Cognizant’s revenue productivity remained largely flat over 5 years, even as EBIT per employee improved through cost control, while Wipro continues to lag, with both revenue and EBIT per employee in 2025 still trailing or barely matching 2020 levels. “Despite massive forces such as large acquisitions, extreme offshoring driven by the pandemic and recent immigration changes, and a sharp depreciation of the rupee, metrics like revenue per employee, EBIT per employee and net profit per employee remained largely flat for large IT services companies,” Ramamoorthy said. While the picture may appear sobering, he added that firms are still in the early stages of building AI-ready talent and scalable use cases. “Only when enterprise-grade deployments happen at scale, these metrics move meaningfully. The next 12–24 months will be pivotal in translating AI’s promise into measurable business impact,” he added.",A comparison of productivity metrics since 2020 shows that the much-touted ai push did not deliver a step-change in per-employee economics across global and indian it services firms.
