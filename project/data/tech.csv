Baseball yields a lot of money and demands a surplus simultaneously. Teams need people with deep pockets to inject cash into the game, which enables their management to invest in elite players and extend ace-class facilities to them. That is why biggies like Steve Cohen become the newsmakers when they decide to invest in a baseball team.Steve Cohen made the headlines when he announced his association with the New York Mets in 2020. Forbes reported that he bought the team for a whopping $2.4 Bn, the highest deal ever made in MLB history for a team’s sale.He brought a handsome amount into the baseball game from his cash cow, Point72 Asset Management Company , a multibillion venture. Let’s explore the net worth of the Mets’ owner in 2025 and the assets and investments contributing to it.According to Forbes, Steve Cohen is the 94th wealthiest person, with a net worth of $21.3 billion. The Bloomberg Billionaire Index reports that his fortune empire has grown by 842M, at a rate of +5.7% in 2024. What he spent on the New York Mets’ payroll and luxury tax in 2024 combines three teams’ total spending in the last two decades.Talking to the New York Post about his expenditure plan in December 2024, Cohen said, “One thing I’ve learned a long time ago, if you want something that’s amazing, it’s going to be uncomfortable.”Steve Cohen ventured into the business space, leveraging his exceptional investment sense. In 1992, he started SAC Capital, one of the biggest hedge fund companies of its time. His confidence in his decision to start this company stems from the fact that he shelled out $25 million from his earnings to bring this venture idea to life.Cohen had to consolidate this venture in 2012 when the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) pressed insider trading charges against him. The venture was a massive success at the time, with $16 billion worth of assets under management (AUM). Following the charges, Cohen consolidated SAC’s operations and paid $1.2 billion in penalties.Cohen didn’t let the setback take over his acumen and moved the remaining funds (left after paying penalties and charges) to start Point72 Asset Management Company. This venture also swelled to a $35 billion (AUM) hedge fund company in 2018. According to Fintel’s data, Point72's portfolio stands at $45,388,177,650.Another top asset of Steve Cohen is the New York Mets, which he bought in 2020 via the biggest sale deal in MLB history, which equaled $2.4 billion.Steve Cohen bought the New York Mets from the Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz families in 2020 for a whopping $2.4 billion.According to the New York Post, the team had already spent $1.13 billion on payroll and paid $228.7 million in taxes before the much-talked-about $765 million, 15-year contract with Juan Soto happened.Other significant contracts that define the Mets' expenditure scene are Francisco Lindor’s 10-year, $341 million deal and Pete Alonso’s $30 million contract in 2025.Steve Cohen can’t mind shelling out these humongous contracts as these pay him back a startling return. Mentioning Bloomberg’s data, Business Insider reported in 2020 that Cohen initially invested $20 million in 2012. The investment paid 350% returns in 2017, when the valuation of Cohen’s stake in the team became $90 million.According to Forbes' MLB team valuation data, Cohen owns 95% of the Mets, which were valued at $3 billion in March 2024.Steve Cohen spends lavishly on multimillion-dollar luxury mansions and apartments in Manhattan’s West Village. He owns a $35 million mansion, which he bought from actor Glenn Ford for $31 million in 2015. His modern art collection is estimated to have a valuation of $1 billion. His NYC duplex penthouse was listed at $115 million in 2014.In 2024’s Forbes 400 list, he appears at number 39. He was the fifth among the most affluent US Sports team owners in 2024.Also Read: MLB insider reflects on Mets' playoff chances after Steve Cohen spent nearly $1,000,000,000 on contracts","Steve cohen bought the new york mets from the fred wilpon and saul katz families in 2020 for a whopping $2.4 billion.

Buyer of Michael Jordan’s mansion forced to slash rentals of the property

After his mansion was on the market for 13 years, Michael Jordan finally managed to sell it for a massive discount. The house which was formerly priced at $29 million, was purchased for $9.5 million recently. However, the Chicago home continues to make losses as the recent buyer faces major issues with the property.The $29 million property owned by Michael Jordan was lowered to $14.89 million when businessman John Cooper decided to purchase it for $9.5 million. Speaking to the Daily Mail about his decision to buy the property, he shared, ""I remember seeing the home for sale and thinking how cool it would be for the person that buys the home. My favourite player to watch was always Jordan. He made shots that seemed impossible, and he got it done on defence too.""However, after buying the expansive plot, he has been facing issues finding tenants who are interested in the property. While the original asking price for rentals was $230,000, he had to slash the price by a little less than half. The property is now listed for $150,000 on the rental market, as a result of little to no interest from potential clients.Additionally, Cooper has also offered the property for $1 million for timeshares, which allows co-owners to get one week's worth of access each year.

"Trump announces 25% tariffs on imported cars: Musk's Tesla takes a hit, but could still win",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/trump-announces-25-tariffs-on-imported-cars-musks-tesla-takes-a-hit-but-could-still-win/articleshow/119568841.cms,"President Donald Trump signs new automotive tariffs in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington. (Doug Mills/The New York Times)

Why it matters

Tesla manufactures all of the vehicles it sells in the US domestically — primarily at its Fremont, California, and Austin, Texas, plants. That gives the company a major advantage over rivals like GM, Ford, and international brands such as Hyundai, Toyota, and Volkswagen, which rely heavily on imports or cross-border supply chains.

But while Tesla’s final assembly happens on US soil, many parts used in its vehicles come from overseas. That includes everything from electric motors to lithium-ion battery cells and raw materials that are essential for EV production. Those components will now be taxed, raising Tesla’s production costs and, potentially, sticker prices.

The tariffs arrive at a time when Tesla is already grappling with declining market share and rising competition. Musk has warned investors that the company’s growth rate may slow this year. Higher production costs due to tariffs could make it harder to compete on price in an increasingly crowded EV market.

Zoom in

Tesla’s Model Y and Model 3 were the top-selling EVs in the US in 2024.

Competitors like GM’s Chevrolet Equinox EV and Ford’s Mustang Mach-E — both built in Mexico — are now facing much steeper cost increases.

Analysts estimate that tariffs could add as much as $6,000 to the price of a vehicle made in Mexico or Canada, and up to $12,000 for some EVs, depending on component sourcing.

Tesla’s stock dipped about 1.3% following Trump’s announcement — less than other automakers, a sign investors see it as relatively insulated.

Despite that insulation, Musk is pushing back against any idea that Tesla will benefit unilaterally. The company’s complex global supply chain, like those of other automakers, remains vulnerable.

The big picture

Between the lines

Trump insists the tariffs will bring jobs and factories back to the US. But even auto executives warn the sudden change could disrupt a finely tuned supply network built over decades. Industry analysts expect a sharp production drop of up to 30% across North America — translating to as many as 20,000 fewer vehicles produced per day.

Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, forecast ""virtually all North American vehicle production"" would be disrupted by mid-April. That includes vehicles assembled in the US using imported parts now subject to tariffs. “Lower production, tighter supply, and higher prices are around the corner,” Smoke told the NYT.

Tesla might avoid some of the worst disruption thanks to its US-based final assembly. But Musk’s comments reflect the reality that even Tesla’s vertically integrated model isn’t immune to global pricing pressures.

Raw materials like lithium, cobalt, and nickel — critical to EV battery production — are still largely sourced and processed overseas. In recent years, Tesla has tried to localize more of its supply chain, but shifting mining and refining operations to the US is a long, capital-intensive process.

What they’re saying

As per a Bloomberg report, here is a summary of all important reactions.

President Donald Trump: “What we’re going to be doing is a 25% tariff on all cars that are not made in the United States. We’re going to charge countries for doing business in our country and taking our jobs, taking our wealth, taking a lot of things that they’ve been taking over the years.”

“What we’re going to be doing is a 25% tariff on all cars that are not made in the United States. We’re going to charge countries for doing business in our country and taking our jobs, taking our wealth, taking a lot of things that they’ve been taking over the years.” Trump again, on the broader goal: “That’s the real Liberation Day of America, and that’s going to be in April 2, and I look forward to it.”

What’s next

The bottom line

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed a sweeping proclamation imposing a 25% tariff on all imported cars, trucks, and key auto parts — a move that could redraw the global auto landscape. While Tesla may be better positioned than many rivals, CEO Elon Musk made it clear his company won’t emerge unscathed.“Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,” Musk wrote in a post on X.The new tariffs, which go into effect April 2, will hit not only fully assembled vehicles but also engines, transmissions, electrical systems, and other crucial components sourced from abroad — including from US allies like Mexico and Canada. The Trump administration has signaled the levies are permanent and will not be subject to negotiation.Also read: Donald Trump announces new auto tariffs ahead of April 2 deadline The auto tariffs are part of Trump’s broader trade agenda, aimed at reshaping US manufacturing and reducing reliance on foreign imports. They come on the heels of a similar move targeting imports from Canada and Mexico, which were initially delayed but are now scheduled for full implementation.“What we’re going to be doing is a 25% tariff on all cars that are not made in the United States,” Trump said Wednesday. “We’re going to charge countries for doing business in our country and taking our jobs.”While the White House says cars produced under the USMCA agreement can avoid full tariffs if they meet strict US content thresholds, the process to certify parts and vehicles remains undefined. In the meantime, many vehicles — including those from Detroit’s Big Three — face an immediate financial squeeze.GM, for example, imports key models like the Chevy Trax and Equinox from South Korea and Mexico. Ford builds the entry-level Maverick and Bronco Sport in Mexico. Stellantis (maker of Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge, and Ram) brings in vehicles from Mexico, Canada, and even Italy.Foreign brands face even steeper challenges. Hyundai and Kia imported over a million vehicles to the US last year. Volkswagen, Toyota, Honda, and BMW also rely heavily on international supply chains. Analysts expect new-car prices to rise significantly — in some cases by thousands of dollars — across the board.“There are very few winners,” Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions, told Bloomberg. “Consumers will be losers because they will have reduced choice and higher prices.”The US government is expected to begin enforcing tariffs on imported vehicles and components starting April 2. Duties on specific auto parts are scheduled to begin by May 3. A process to assess and certify US content in vehicles assembled in North America under USMCA is still being developed.Trump has hinted at further moves — including a tax deduction for interest on car loans, but only for American-made vehicles. That could further tilt the playing field in Tesla’s favor, especially as it pushes to lower prices and expand EV adoption.“If you borrow money to buy a car, you’re allowed to deduct interest payments... but only if the car is made in America,” Trump said.Tesla may emerge as one of the least affected players in the wake of Trump’s tariffs, but it’s not a free pass. Costs are rising, parts of its supply chain are under threat, and the entire industry is entering a period of volatility and uncertainty.Musk’s warning underscores the reality: even domestic automakers are caught in the storm. Still, with rivals facing steeper cost hikes and supply disruptions, Tesla’s relative advantage could become more pronounced — if it can navigate the new terrain without losing its footing.(With inputs from agencies)","Tesla manufactures all of the vehicles it sells in the us domestically. That gives the company a major advantage over rivals like gm, ford, and international brands.

When should you exit an investment? Top things to keep in mind,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/investing/when-should-you-exit-an-investment-top-things-to-keep-in-mind/articleshow/119410980.cms,"Here are key scenarios where exiting an investment may be advisable. (AI image)

By Sandeep Walunj

""If the job has been correctly done when a common stock is purchased, the time to sell it is – almost never."" – Philip Fisher

""You may not know when to start but must know when to stop!""

Here are key scenarios where exiting an investment may be advisable:

1. Achievement of Goals

Did you invest with a clear goal—retirement, buying a house, or funding education? If so, exit when the goal nears.

Shift to less volatile asset classes as the exit date approaches to minimize risks.

2. Profit Booking

Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio – If significantly above historical or sector averages, it may indicate overvaluation. Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio – A high ratio may signal overvaluation relative to intrinsic worth. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis – If the stock price has reached its fair value based on future cash flows, exiting may be prudent.

Reinvest proceeds wisely and consider tax implications.

During a market rally, sell in tranches to secure gains while retaining exposure.

3.

Stop-Loss Strategy

A stop-loss order sets a predetermined exit point to limit losses.

Example: If a stock is bought at ₹100 with a 10% stop-loss, sell it at ₹90, preventing larger losses.

Set stop-loss levels based on investment type—example 5-15% for volatile stocks, 15-25% for stable blue-chip stocks—aligned with your risk tolerance.

4. Underperformance

Mutual Funds – If it lags behind category peers and benchmarks persistently.

Stocks – Red flags include:

Declining revenues and profits. Rising debt levels. Loss of market leadership. Governance issues (e.g., fraud, regulatory troubles).



5. Portfolio Rebalancing

A well-diversified portfolio needs periodic rebalancing.

If an asset class grows disproportionately large, reduce exposure and reinvest in underweighted assets.

Example: If equities surge, selling some stocks and reallocating to bonds can maintain balance.

6. Market and Economic Conditions

Rising Interest Rates – Sectors like real estate and capital-intensive industries may underperform in this scenario.

Recession Indicators – An inverted yield curve or declining consumer spending may warrant exiting cyclical stocks.

Regulatory Changes – New laws, tax policies, or sectoral regulations can impact profitability.

Behavioural Biases That Delay Exit Decisions

Loss Aversion – Refusing to sell at a loss, hoping for recovery instead of reallocating capital.

Confirmation Bias – Ignoring negative signals and focusing only on positive news.

Anchoring Bias – Fixating on past high prices and resisting selling below that level.

Investors often see every investment brand, platform, influencer, and even advisors pushing them to invest and invest quickly. However, there is little discussion on when to exit.Most experts seem to suggest that selling is unnecessary:On the other hand, practical voices like Zig Ziglar say:So, where does the truth lie? As always, somewhere in the middle!If the objective was profit booking, evaluate if further upside exists using frameworks like:Exit an investment if it consistently underperforms, despite a reasonable recovery period:Macroeconomic shifts can impact investment viability. Consider reducing exposure in cases of:Many investors hold on to poor investments due to psychological biases:As you can see, exiting an investment is as important as entering one.

(AI image)

How is gratuity payment calculated? Formula explained

The calculation method is: (15X Final drawn salary X Service duration)/26

The computation would be: (15X40,000X5)/26.

The gratuity amount due to Mis X is Rs 1,15,384.61, rounded to Rs 1,15,385.

For staff not under the Payment of Gratuity Act's purview:

The computation for his gratuity proceeds as: (15X40,000X6)/30.

The final gratuity amount that Mr X shall receive is Rs 1,20,000.

Salaried employees quite often have gratuity as a component of their CTC (cost to company). The Payment of Gratuity Rules, 1972, stipulates that staff members become entitled to gratuity after completing five years of uninterrupted service with an organisation. But, did you know that you can qualify for gratuity payout before completing five years, provided they serve beyond a particular duration.According to an ET report, experts say that employees qualify for gratuity upon completing 4 years and 240 days with an organisation. For example, if someone began working at an organisation on January 1, 2021, they would be eligible for gratuity upon leaving after August 29, 2025. This eligibility occurs because they would have served 4 years and 240 days by then, although their five-year milestone would only be completed by January 1, 2026.This provision exists because of how continuous service is defined in the Payment of Gratuity Act Puneet Gupta, Tax Partner, EY India, told ET, ""Section 4(1) of the Payment of Gratuity Act says that gratuity will be payable if an employee has rendered a minimum continuous service of five years. Section 2A of the Payment of Gratuity Act defines continuous service. Section 2A(2) of the Gratuity Act defines the deemed-to-be in continuous service. An employee is deemed to be in continuous service for one year if an employee during the 12 preceding calendar months has worked under the employer for not less than 190 days or 240 days, as the case may be.""Also Read | Tax planning before March 31 deadline? Tax saving fixed deposits with high interest rates - check list According to the Payment of Gratuity Act, employees working in underground mines or establishments operating fewer than six days weekly must complete 190 days, whilst others need 240 days. When an employee completes more than 240 days in the fifth year, they are considered to have completed an additional year of service, totalling five years, thus becoming eligible for gratuity.Saraswathi Kasturirangan, Partner at Deloitte India explains that an employee on payroll becomes eligible for gratuity payment upon completing 4 years and 240 days of service when leaving the organisation. The 240-day period is equivalent to 7.89 months. Therefore, workers should ensure their tenure extends to 4 years and 8 months to qualify for gratuity benefits upon resignation or retirement, she says. Consequently, staff members whose continuous service falls short of 4 years and 240 days, for instance, those departing after 4 years and 6 months or 4 years, 6 months and 1 day, cannot claim gratuity benefits, she notes.The requirement of five years' continuous service is waived if the employee's service ends due to death or disablement.Gratuity payment calculations are governed by specific guidelines outlined in the Payment of Gratuity Act. The calculation method varies depending on whether employees fall under the Act's purview or not.Also Read | Gold prices at record high! Have yellow metal prices peaked? Check these 5 charts before putting more money in gold The Act's applicability is determined by the organisation's workforce size. If an organisation has employed 10 or more people on any single day within the previous 12 calendar months, it comes under the Act's jurisdiction. Once covered, the organisation remains subject to the Act even if staff numbers subsequently decrease below 10.For staff members covered by the Payment of Gratuity Act, the payment is calculated using 15 days of their final drawn salary for each full year of service, including any period exceeding six months.The final drawn salary encompasses basic pay, dearness allowance and sales commission, as stipulated in the Act.Consider Miss X who has served an organisation (with a six-day work week) for 4 years and 300 days. Her eligibility for gratuity payment is confirmed as her service exceeds 4 years and 240 days. With a final basic salary of Rs 40,000, the 300 days convert to 9.863 months. For gratuity calculations, when excess months exceed 6 (9 months here), it counts as one complete year.Also Read | New TDS rules from April 1, 2025: Check new tax deduction limits for FD interest, MFs and lottery wins Gratuity remains payable even when organisations aren't covered by the Payment of Gratuity Act. In such instances, the gratuity is calculated as half a month's salary per completed service year, disregarding any incomplete year (months less than a year) in the calculation.The gratuity calculation follows this equation: (15 X Last drawn salary X Number of years of completed service)/30.Consider a scenario where Mr X has served an organisation (not under the Act's purview) for 6 years and 7 months. His final basic salary stands at Rs 40,000, and the organisation opts to provide him with gratuity.",Gratuity payment calculations are governed by specific guidelines outlined in the payment of gratuity act.
