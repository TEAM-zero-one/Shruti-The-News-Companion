A generous move of Travis Kelce for Kansas City youth sparks debate on social media

Poll What do you admire most about Travis Kelce’s game? His clutch performances His powerful catches

Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce is no stranger to giving back, but his latest act of philanthropy is grabbing headlines for more than just its price tag. The tight end recently donated a $3.3 million home to Foster Love, a nonprofit working to support homeless youth in Kansas City. While many have applauded the move as a heartfelt gesture, the internet has exploded with speculation — with some fans claiming pop sensation Taylor Swift may have quietly financed the generous donation.The donation comes on the heels of a tough Super Bowl loss, but Travis Kelce’s influence off the field remains as powerful as ever. With a $17.1 million annual contract and an estimated net worth of $90 million, he’s got the financial means to make a serious impact. Still, not everyone is convinced the donation was purely altruistic.The controversy kicked off when fans began questioning the true origin of the funds. Some social media users speculated that Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce’s high-profile girlfriend, may have contributed — or even footed the entire bill. Theories range from Swift subtly backing the donation to the couple strategically making philanthropic moves to boost their public image. “Some fans assume that the singer paid,” read one line in a Marca report, igniting even more online chatter.Still, those close to the athlete say this isn’t out of character for him. Kelce founded the Eighty-Seven & Running foundation in 2015, focusing on underserved youth in both Cleveland and Kansas City. In 2024 alone, he donated 25,000 meals to students in need — a far cry from a one-off publicity stunt.Many are calling the donation a “classy act” and a reflection of Kelce’s long-standing commitment to social good. Others, however, suggest the timing and optics are too calculated. Tax benefits have also entered the conversation, with critics speculating the move could be financially strategic.Also Read: “Bizarre visuals”: Taylor Swift emoji rumors spark chaos as viral tweet dupes iPhone users with fake Apple update Despite the noise, Kelce's track record speaks volumes. His involvement with programs like Operation Breakthrough and direct contributions to education initiatives underscore a history of impact. Whether motivated by love, strategy, or genuine goodwill, one thing is clear: lives in Kansas City will be changed for the better.","Travis kelce recently donated a $3.3 million home to foster love, a nonprofit working to support homeless youth in kansas city.

From country roots to business mogul: How Taylor Swift built her billion-dollar empire

Taylor Swift has officially joined the elite club of billionaires in 2025, solidifying her status not just as a global pop phenomenon but also as a masterful businesswoman. According to Forbes’ latest World’s Billionaires list, Swift now boasts a net worth of $1.6 billion—largely thanks to her record-shattering Eras Tour and savvy control over her musical empire.While other stars like Oprah Winfrey, Kim Kardashian, and Rihanna made headlines for their ventures into beauty, fashion, and media, Taylor Swift’s rise is unique. She didn’t build her wealth through brand endorsements or business acquisitions alone—she did it with songwriting, performing, and reclaiming her artistry. Her 2023–2024 Eras Tour alone grossed over $2 billion across 149 shows in 21 countries, making it the highest-grossing tour in history.With 13 albums hitting No. 1—including “Reputation,” “Midnights,” and “1989 (Taylor’s Version)”—Swift’s music is not just topping charts but also generating massive revenue streams from sales, streaming, and licensing deals. Unlike many of her peers, Swift owns the masters of her re-recorded albums, giving her a larger slice of the financial pie than most artists ever see.Swift’s journey began in country music, but her evolution into a genre-blending global superstar came with equally strategic business acumen. Her re-recording campaign was not just a statement of artistic independence—it turned into a billion-dollar blueprint. Beyond music, Swift has leveraged her influence with precision, keeping endorsements minimal and instead turning her image into a brand of authenticity.In a testament to her character, Swift recently donated $5 million toward relief efforts for Hurricanes Milton and Helene, underscoring her belief in using wealth for meaningful impact.Even as billionaires like Kim Kardashian dominate fashion with SKIMS and Rihanna with Fenty Beauty, it’s Swift who is now being compared to moguls like Oprah and Jay-Z. Her business approach, built on integrity, ownership, and creativity, sets her apart.Also Read: Sadie Sink finally breaks silence on age-gap controversy in Taylor Swift's All Too Well short film In a list filled with actors, reality stars, and entrepreneurs, Swift remains a standout—proof that artistic integrity, combined with a relentless work ethic, can be just as powerful as boardroom deals.","Taylor swift has officially joined the elite club of billionaires in 2025.

Similarly, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt acquired a $15 million Georgetown home once occupied by Jacqueline Kennedy.

Former eBay executive Jeff Skoll spent $17 million on Virginia properties reportedly planned for a compound.

Mark Zuckerberg has become the latest tech billionaire to establish a presence in Washington DC, purchasing a $23 million mansion in the upscale Woodland Normanstone neighborhood, a report has said. The acquisition, confirmed by Facebook parent company Meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.Politico reports that for weeks, the identity of the buyer remained shrouded in mystery as real estate agents were bound by non-disclosure agreements. Shortly after the cash transaction closed in early March, images of the 15,000-square-foot property became pixelated on Google Maps, the report added.Neighborhood residents noted increased activity at the previously vacant home, coinciding with reports that Zuckerberg’s private jet had landed at Dulles Airport.The publication says that a Meta spokesperson confirmed the purchase, explaining: “Mark and Priscilla have purchased a home in DC, which will allow Mark to spend more time there as Meta continues the work on policy issues related to American technology leadership.”The official explanation cites convenience and safety during increased Washington visits. Notably, Zuckerberg also has properties in Palo Alto, Lake Tahoe and Hawaii, among other places.Although tech titans have acquired Washington properties even before Trump's return to office, the pace has reportedly accelerated significantly in the past year.","The acquisition, confirmed by facebook parent company meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.

Stock market recommendations:Trent surpassed the milestone of 1,000 fashion stores for FY25, reaching a total of 757 Zudio stores—an increase of 39%—and 248 Westside stores, marking 6% growth. In the March 2025 quarter alone, 122 new Zudio stores were added. Trent’s industry-leading growth, driven by healthy SSSG, store productivity, and robust footprint additions, along with the scale-up of Zudio and newer categories, offers a huge runway for growth over the next few years. TRENT’s focus on ramping up Star through Fresh and its own brands provides an additional growth driver in the grocery segment. We estimate a revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 32%/34%/39% over FY24-27, driven by 21% CAGR in area additions & mid-single-digit improvement in productivity.HDFC Bank is effectively addressing post-merger challenges (high CD ratio, costly borrowings) through robust deposit mobilization (+15% CAGR FY25-27E) and portfolio rebalancing toward high-yielding Retail/Commercial & Rural Banking loans (~11% CAGR). NIMs (3.43% in 3QFY25) are poised to expand to 3.5-3.6% by FY27 as funding costs ease, supported by a rising CASA mix. Prudent asset quality (GNPA/NNPA: 1.4%/0.4%) and a hefty INR262b provision buffer mitigate risks. Operational streamlining (cost-to-income: ~40% by FY27) and margin recovery underpin RoA/RoE targets of 1.8%/14.1%.","Motilal oswal financial services ltd, the top stock picks for the week (starting april 7, 2025) are trent and hdfc bank.

For Delhivery, the deal represents a strategic move to increase its scale and strengthen its competitive position in the fast-evolving logistics market.Sahil Barua, Managing Director and CEO of Delhivery, expressed confidence in the move, stating, “The Indian economy needs continuous improvements in logistics cost efficiency, speed, and reach. This acquisition will help us serve the customers of both companies better by making bold investments in infrastructure, technology, and our network.”Delhivery, with Rs 5,488 crore in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, is well-positioned to finance the acquisition. The deal is still subject to approval from the Competition Commission of India (CCI) but is expected to close in the next six months. After the acquisition, Ecom Express will operate as a subsidiary of Delhivery.The deal marks the end of Ecom Express's IPO ambitions. The company had previously filed a draft prospectus in August 2024, seeking to raise Rs 1,284.5 crore in fresh capital while also offering Rs 1,315.5 crore in secondary stake sales. However, the deteriorating market conditions led to the postponement of these plans.In the lead-up to the acquisition, Ecom Express had already begun consolidating its operations, shutting down several delivery hubs, and laying off hundreds of employees. Delhivery had also raised concerns about Ecom Express's financial practices, accusing its rival of inflating its operational metrics, particularly by double-counting return-to-origin shipments, which inflated the company’s reported volumes.Ecom Express has faced further challenges following the death of its cofounder, T. A. Krishnan, in October 2023. Krishnan, who helped establish the company in 2012 and played a vital role in shaping India’s e-commerce logistics landscape, had stepped back from day-to-day operations over a year before his passing.","Delhivery has announced its acquisition of ecom express in an all-cash deal valued at rs 1,407 crore.

IL&FS seeks more time to complete resolution,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ilfs-seeks-more-time-to-complete-resolution/articleshow/120048727.cms,"MUMBAI: IL&FS has requested an extension from the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) to resolve 57 out of the 108 entities still in limbo, citing substantial progress in its ongoing restructuring. In its affidavit, the company reported that it has successfully resolved 197 of its 302 subsidiaries, which are no longer part of the insolvency process. To date, lenders have recovered Rs 45,000 crore of the Rs 99,000 crore owed, while the recovery target has been increased to Rs 61,000 crore.The Appellate Tribunal had originally set March 31, 2025, as the deadline for the completion of the resolution process for 58 entities. Since then, the company has successfully extricated Rohtas Bio Energy from insolvency proceedings . The latest filing, however, underscores the need for continued protection from lender actions for 57 remaining entities, most of which are at an advanced stage of resolution. These entities, some awaiting approval from the NCLT, face delays due to factors outside IL&FS's control.The list of 57 companies include several large infrastructure entities including the Chenani Nashri Tunnelways, where a deal has been struck with Cube Highways, which will eventually address a debt of Rs 5,449 crore.Among the challenges the company faces are the arbitrary withdrawal of approvals from government bodies, obstructive actions by lenders, and the auto-debiting of escrow accounts. These disruptions are compounded by delays in payments from govt agencies like NHAI and NHIDCL.","Il&fs has requested an extension from the national company law appellate tribunal (nclat) to resolve 57 out of the 108 entities still in limbo.
