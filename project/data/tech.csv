Shawn Michaels’ career earnings and WWE income streams

Rebecca Curci Hickenbottom’s career and shared assets

Both Shawn Michaels and Rebecca Curci Hickenbottom have kept their respective finances private for a long time, so finding an estimated total net worth for the couple is an exercise in educated guesswork rather than exact calculation. However, by looking at the thousands of matches in Michaels' wrestling career and Curci's limited exposure to the world of professional entertainment, a general financial outline can be formed.Despite this, Shawn Michaels' net worth is estimated to be about $10 million in 2025, according to widely cited estimates, and his wife Rebecca Curci is believed to have a personal net worth of under $1 million. Their combined vermögen is generally placed in the $10.5 million to $11 million range together.That number is mostly driven by Michaels' earnings, brand value, and ongoing role in WWE.Michael Shawn Hickenbottom, known to the world as Shawn Michaels, amassed most of his wealth way back in the prime days of his in-ring career for WWE. Michaels was one of the company's most bankable stars of the mid-90s through the 2000s, and as such enjoyed the benefits of main-event contracts, pay-per-view bonuses, and merchandise royalties on his ""Heartbreak Kid"" character.Many of his contemporaries have become high-level corporate executives post their full-time competitive careers, but Michaels made the transition seamlessly. He has been Vice President and Senior Vice President, focused on various elements of WWE's NXT brand over the past several years. The executive role gives him a steady annual salary that is supplemented by his residual income from licensing, appearances, and long-term merchandising contracts. Specific salary numbers are impossible to trace, though industry watchers see his WWE office role as a major, steady revenue stream in any event.Rebecca Curci Hickenbottom was in the spotlight for a relatively brief period. In the late 1990s, she found fame as “Whisper,” one of the Nitro Girls dance troupe of WCW. Curci dated Michaels after her WCW run (they wed in '99) and then eased out of the public eye, preferring life as a wife and mother to a long-term TV or business profile.As a result, estimates of her personal wealth range widely and tend to be modest. Following her time in WCW, there is little public record of large independent business ventures or entertainment earnings.Also Read: Shawn Michaels calls Fraxiom WWE’s best tag team right now",Shawn michaels' net worth is estimated to be about $10 million in 2025.

The Audi R8, with its V10 elegance and grace, may be cold but still very precise, could be wrangling. For a choice of luxury SUVs, he prefers the Range Rover Vogue, which can offer him maximum class and comfort combined with very light capability.The Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 is McDavid's car that radiates sounds; however, it's the American muscle car that provides supercharged vigor and finely-tuned road presence. Then there is the Ford F-150 Raptor, the beast that proves McDavid is not afraid of getting dirty off the road. The Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG, on the other hand, is the one that adds drama to the collection; its characteristic gullwing doors and powerful V8 engine are visually striking and lend the impression of being almost a character in the collection.Out of all the cars in his collection, the Porsche 911 GT2 RS is undoubtedly Connor McDavid’s favorite, according to several sources—the absolute choice for those who want nothing but the best in performance. Thanks to its track-oriented design, it has extremely precise control, and it produces massive power—basically a machine for sportspeople who love speed not only as a mere idea but as a way of life.

"Delhi pollution crisis: Govt restricts non-BS VI vehicle entry; commuters slam abrupt move, metro faces extra pressure",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/gurgaon/vehicle-ban-chaos-delhi-restricts-non-bs-vi-entry-commuters-residents-slam-abrupt-move-metro-faces-extra-pressure/articleshow/126028424.cms,"GURGAON/NOIDA: A decision by Delhi govt to ban the entry of non-BS VI vehicles from Thursday threatens to upend daily life for lakhs of commuters across NCR, with more than 2 lakh vehicles in Gurgaon, 4 lakh in Noida and 5.5 lakh in Ghaziabad alone set to be sidelined overnight. The move, aimed at tackling Delhi's toxic air, has triggered a wave of anxiety and frustration among residents who depend on cross-border travel for work and family obligations.According to official records, Gurgaon is home to nearly 2 lakh privately owned vehicles that fall below the BS-VI emission standard - comprising about 1.5 lakh BS-III petrol cars and over 36,000 BS-IV diesel vehicles. The city also counts more than 47,000 commercial BS-IV diesel vehicles and over 2,000 BS-III petrol vehicles, along with around 2,200 BS-III and IV buses.In addition, some 92,000 diesel vehicles in Gurgaon have already crossed the 10-year age limit.The story is similar in Noida, where the ban will affect over 4 lakh vehicles. Out of nearly 10 lakh registered vehicles in the city, 1.4 lakh are BS-III models - 96,210 petrol and 41,067 diesel - while 2.8 lakh are BS-IV vehicles, with a majority running on petrol. Only about 4.2 lakh vehicles in Noida meet the BS-VI standard and will be allowed to enter Delhi.In Ghaziabad, over 5.5 lakh vehicles are BS-VI compliant, but more than 5.5 lakh others, including 1.7 lakh BS-III and 3.7 lakh BS-IV vehicles, will be barred.For many residents, the ban feels abrupt and impractical. Manoj Kumar of Gurgaon's Sector 50 called the order ""absurd"", arguing that Delhi and its neighbouring cities function as a single unit. ""Lakhs of people from Gurgaon and Faridabad travel to Delhi daily for work and other purposes. This order will obstruct the free flow movement of people,"" he said.Subhangi Sharma, from Sector 40, echoed the sentiment, criticising the govt for resorting to what she described as ""quick fixes"" instead of addressing the root causes of pollution. ""Putting restrictions on vehicles is the only thing our govt knows when it comes to dealing with pollution,"" she said.Noida's assistant regional transport officer, Nand Kumar, explained that the ban is in line with the Graded Response Action Plan (GRAP) III, which requires NCR states to restrict BS-III petrol and BS-IV diesel vehicles.""Now, Delhi govt has gone a step further and imposed a ban on all categories of vehicles below BS-VI. Traffic police teams have been deployed at all Noida-Delhi borders. Such vehicles will not be allowed to enter Delhi. Violators will be fined and their vehicles seized,"" he said.Alok Singh, a resident of Greater Noida's Alpha 1, pointed out the lack of alternatives for those affected. ""The govt enforces rules and bans old vehicles in a random manner. But what alternative modes of transport are available for people to commute during such bans? Nearly half of the population does not own BS-VI vehicles and will be badly affected. This will also put additional pressure on metro services, which are already overloaded,"" he said.Singh, who owns both a BS-IV and a BS-VI vehicle, questioned whether such bans alone can improve air quality, given the multiple factors involved.In Noida, Rahul Saha from 7X sectors accused the govt of using older vehicles as scapegoats. ""It is trying to arm twist people into buying BS-VI cars. This is done in parts to appease car manufacturers who are not getting good bookings even after GST cuts. A complete ban for private cars is uncalled for,"" he said.","More than 2 lakh vehicles in gurgaon, 4 lakh in noida and 5.5 lakh in ghaziabad set to be sidelined overnight.

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status







Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon musk has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

“I don’t want that”: Luke Nichols finally opens up about stepping away from Outdoor Boys and choosing family over fame,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/i-dont-want-that-luke-nichols-finally-opens-up-about-stepping-away-from-outdoor-boys-and-choosing-family-over-fame/articleshow/126010022.cms,"Luke Nichols (via YouTube/ Outdoor Boys)

Fame, safety concerns, and a lifestyle Nichols no longer wanted





Former YouTuber Luke Nichols, who was behind the highly successful Outdoor Boys channel, recently revealed his reason behind stepping back from YouTube and content creation. For many years, Nichols built a loyal following by documenting his outdoor adventures, survival skills, and familial moments that felt authentic and relatable. His channel’s rapid growth turned him into one of YouTube’s most recognizable outdoor creators.In an interview on Steven’s MyLifeOutdoors channel, Nichols spoke candidly about how he did not see himself growing old as a YouTuber and had been thinking of retirement for some years. He emphasized that other concerns, including long-term sustainability, personal safety, and family priorities, shaped his outlook.During his appearance on MyLifeOutdoors, Nichols explained his long-term plans and how being a YouTuber was not feasible anymore. While also reflecting on the nature of online fame, he said, ""I always knew that I wasn't going to do this forever. And I've been thinking of retiring for a couple of years, actually. You know? I've been talking.""Nichols further went back in time to when he achieved peak fame and how people were recognizing him everywhere.Instead of embracing all the attention, he grew concerned about himself and his family. The former YouTuber added, ""A big part of it was the exposure. The channel blew up really big, and it kind of went from, 'Oh, people recognize me every once in a while…we started to have really serious conversations about security issues and the safety of the family.For Nichols, the idea of becoming a full-time celebrity did not attract him in the first place. He expressed his desire to live a normal life with his family and have the freedom to go wherever he wanted without any disruptions of any kind. He stated, “I'm looking at, you know, 'Okay, I'm going to be, you know, a really full-blown celebrity lifestyle.' I'm like, 'I don't want that. I don't want it for the kids. I don't want to live that way. ”Alongside fame, Nichols further pointed to another issue many creators face, which is the need to work at a relentless pace. He asserted that working 80 to 100 hours a week had taken a toll on his health and balance. For him, stepping away was not about choosing a life that kept him grounded and focused on his family.Also read: OutDoor Boys star Luke Nichols comes back from YouTube retirement to help MyLifeOutdoors creator Steven in family crisis","Former youtuber luke nichols, who was behind the highly successful outdoor boys channel, recently revealed his reason behind stepping back from youtube and content creation.

The state of AI adoption





American billionaire and entrepreneur Mark Cuban has now urged the young engineers entering the job market to prioritise small and medium-sized companies over multinational corporations (MNCs) when seeking opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI). Cuban feels that smaller companies offer better platform for new graduates to make an immediate impact, while large corporations often dilute individual contributions.Speaking in an interview with CNBC and on his podcast The Dumbest Guy in the Room, Cuban explained that smaller companies are mainly entrepreneur-driven and they lack the deep IT departments or larger corporations. This gap creates opportunities for fresh graduates which directly contribute to the AI projects.“Small- to medium-size companies don’t have that depth. They are typically entrepreneurially driven and don’t have the flexibility to have people research things. Bringing a new graduate on to work on agentic AI projects is inexpensive for them and can get them immediate results,” Cuban said.Cuban also used the example of his own company, Cost Plus Drugs, noting how AI can automate processes to boost productivity, competitiveness, and profitability.Cuban argued that in big organisations, AI skills may not stand out as they are common among thousands of IT employees. On the other hand, in smaller firms often lack such expertise, making new graduates with AI knowledge invaluable. He also compared the present wave of AI with early days of the internet, when young engineers were hired to implement new technologies because they were more comfortable with them than older executives.Cuban also highlighted that 95% of companies have not yet seen measurable revenue returns from AI investments. The exceptions, he said, are mostly early-stage startups led by young entrepreneurs who design their processes around AI models tailored to their businesses.He urged his children and other young people to learn as much as possible about AI, stressing that companies are still grappling with how to use the technology for competitive advantage.",Mark cuban has urged young engineers to prioritise small and medium-sized companies over multinational corporations (mncs) when seeking opportunities in artificial intelligence.

I love everyone who shows love day after day! It is important that you guys also believe that you can do whatever you want in this world! Thank you ❤️”





Kai Cenat made the most of his 24th birthday and used it to spread a rather unique and genuine message among fans. Instead of celebrating on a full-blown “W” stream, the famous Twitch streamer made a video that featured him talking about his mental health issues. In the video that went viral on various social media platforms, Kai thanked fans for their unconditional support but added that the stress associated with trying to achieve more and more content had been giving him a tough time.In the video, Kai said that it’s not because he hasn’t had success, but there is a cost to success in terms of how he feels. The cost has to do with fear, with self-doubt, with the feelings he has inside because he always has to push himself creatively.Kai has announced that he wants to open up to his viewers in a better way. Clearly, this message resonates because it occurred on a day typically associated with celebration.Kai revealed that the pressure of always wanting to grow as a creator may have led him to feel mentally exhausted. As a streamer, he discussed how he had to take a step back and prioritize healing, as opposed to being consumed with thoughts about numbers, views, and what others might think of him.As a streamer, he advised everyone to never underestimate the significance of the streamer's or anyone else's mental health, especially when it might dictate their survival or growth as a creator.He also mentioned, “His message resonated with many viewers, who identified the people he referred to as those who tirelessly dedicate themselves online and rarely take a break. His fans filled his comments section with messages of appreciation for his honesty and reminding him that it's always fine to take a slower pace in life.This viral moment sparked many people to talk about the real consequences of burnout in the online world of live streaming, where people work so many hours and are always in the spotlight without realizing the consequences to their mental and physical health.Ultimately, Kai Cenat’s birthday video reminded us that even for the greatest content creators in the world, struggles exist behind the scenes. In opening up, not only did he give his fans a reminder that he is trying to get past his struggles and become a better person, he also paved a new way for a healthy conversation on mental health.Also Read: Caleb Hammer invites Frogan on financial audit amid Asmongold backlash","Kai cenat made the most of his 24th birthday and used it to spread a rather unique and genuine message among fans.

Raising foreign direct investment (FDI) in the insurance sector from 74% to 100%, while ensuring that one of the top officials, chairman, managing director, or CEO, is an Indian citizen. Allowing sector-specific licences, enabling insurers to operate in niche lines such as cyber, property, or marine insurance. The government may notify other classes of business in consultation with IRDA. Permitting mergers between non-insurance and insurance companies. Shifting from detailed statutory prescriptions to a regulation-driven framework, giving IRDA the authority to set operational norms such as capital requirements, solvency margins, and investment conditions through regulations rather than Parliament-approved legislation. The Bill allows IRDA to set commission and remuneration caps for agents. Establishing a Policyholders’ education and protection fund funded through penalties imposed on insurers. Expand the definition of insurance intermediaries to include entities such as insurance repositories. Eased licensing requirements for surveyors and loss assessors, with oversight moving to a regulatory framework. Allowing LIC to establish zonal offices without prior approval from the Centre and enable overseas branches to maintain funds. Provide for a five-year term for the chairperson and other whole-time members of IRDA, or until they reach 65 years, whichever is earlier.

The government on Tuesday introduced the Sabka Bima Sabki Raksha (Amendment of Insurance Laws) Bill, 2025 in Parliament, but what could it mean for you?The Bill, already cleared by the Union Cabinet, aims to revolutionise India’s insurance sector, making coverage easier to access for all and setting the ambitious goal of universal protection by 2047.

GCCs reshape India’s tech jobs: Hiring grows four times faster than IT services; AI-led roles drive surge,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gccs-reshape-indias-tech-jobs-hiring-grows-four-times-faster-than-it-services-ai-led-roles-drive-surge/articleshow/126007254.cms,"Representative image made with AI

AI-Powered Future: Next Gen Careers You Should Watch

Global Capability Centres (GCCs) are recruiting technology professionals at a rate four times faster than IT services companies, representing the most significant employment transformation in India's IT sector in ten years.GCCs are increasing their workforce by 18-27% annually, whilst IT services grow at 4-6%, as per TeamLease Digital's statistics, cited by Economic Times.Their combined workforce has reached nearly 2 million, rising from 1.2 million in 2022, generating approximately 300,000 positions yearly. In comparison, IT services have created only 25,000-40,000 net jobs annually during this timeframe. ""This is the sharpest divergence we have seen.There is over a 20% difference in hiring growth,"" said Neeti Sharma, CEO of TeamLease Digital.""GCC demand is concentrated in AI, cloud, cybersecurity and product engineering – areas that require deeper domain expertise,"" she added.This acceleration stems from international organisations internalising crucial operations through GCCs, operations that previously supported India's outsourcing industry.Industry analysts anticipate this pattern continuing as additional multinational firms establish GCCs.""Companies are prioritising in-house, high-skill, multi-disciplinary teams inside GCCs. Work that requires IP ownership, speed, security and domain depth is increasingly being internalised rather than outsourced,"" said Vikram Ahuja, cofounder of ANSR, a firm engaged in building and managing GCCs.This year, over 90 new companies have established GCCs in India, while more than 150 existing centres have grown, he observed.""This translates to around 160,000 new GCC jobs in FY25, and FY26 is projected to cross 200,000,"" Ahuja said. ""Meanwhile, India's top five IT services firms added barely 11,000 net employees in the first nine months of FY25.""Whilst IT services organisations still employ twice the GCC workforce, this difference is diminishing rapidly as GCCs become India's primary source of technology employment.""GCCs are the primary drivers of tech hiring in India. IT services have seen only a mild rebound from last year's slowdown,"" said Kapil Joshi, CEO of staffing firm Quess Corp.GCCs generated over 100,000 of 120,000 new technology positions in FY24 and FY25, while IT services contributed minimally, he indicated.Ahuja forecasts continued growth in GCC recruitment, with the disparity between GCCs and IT services expanding further.GCCs plan to increase graduate recruitment and expand into smaller cities, while traditional IT services companies experience slower growth.TCS, India's largest IT services company, plans to reduce its workforce by approximately 2%, affecting over 12,000 positions globally, as part of restructuring.Other traditional IT services firms are conducting unofficial redundancies, with actual departures exceeding reported figures, according to industry observers.GCCs are handling AI and ML development, cloud engineering, cybersecurity, platform modernisation, product engineering, digital customer experience, and data management.This shows GCCs functioning as innovation centres rather than support units.Salary trends reflect high-skill talent demand. GCCs typically offer 15-25% higher compensation for standard engineering roles and 30-40% more for AI, GenAI and advanced ML positions compared to IT services. GCCs also achieve better offer acceptance rates of 60-70%, while IT services face more declinations.GCCs are achieving double-digit growth – typically 10-12% – while major IT services companies remain stagnant or show minimal growth whilst focusing on optimisation, noted Jaspreet Singh, partner at GT Bharat.""The talent market is signalling where the next decade of high-value digital work will be built, and that is inside India's GCCs,"" he said.Despite challenges in securing AI and cybersecurity talent and developing product leadership, the direction is evident.As international companies transition from cost-based outsourcing to capability-driven internal teams, Indian GCCs are becoming the principal centre for future engineering and AI expertise globally.","Global capability centres (gccs) are recruiting technology professionals at a rate four times faster than it services companies.

Easing car emission rules 'pragmatic' response to industry challenges: EU VP,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/easing-car-emission-rules-pragmatic-response-to-industry-challenges-eu-vp/articleshow/126012982.cms,"STRASBOURG: Relaxing car emission targets is a ""pragmatic"" answer to the sector's challenges but the EU's green ambitions remain intact, the bloc's industry chief said Tuesday as Brussels walked back a 2035 combustion-engine ban.""The European Commission has chosen an approach that is both pragmatic and consistent with its climate objectives and ambitions,"" Stephane Sejourne told AFP in an interview at the EU parliament.Heeding calls from industry, the European Commission agreed to give ground on one of its flagship climate measures by relaxing the planned ban on new combustion-engine car sales.Instead of a full switch to electric vehicles , Brussels will let carmakers use ""other types of technologies"" for a limited part of their sales beyond 2035, Sejourne said.Adopted under commission chief Ursula von der Leyen's first term, the combustion-engine ban was a key part of the EU's pledge to reach carbon neutrality by 2050.""The goal remains the same,"" said the commission vice president. ""But the flexibilities are pragmatic given consumer uptake and the difficulty for manufacturers to offer 100 percent electric by 2035.""Faced with competition from China and trade tensions with the United States, the EU has delayed or pared back a series of green measures in a pro-business shift over the past year.Sejourne back in March warned that Europe's car industry was in ""mortal danger"" as the EU launched a rescue plan for the sector, with rivals speeding ahead in the United States and China.The jewel in Europe's industrial crown, the auto industry employs almost 14 million people and contributes some seven percent to the European Union's economy -- but faces rising threats.Sejourne rejected the charge from environmentalists that the concessions granted to automakers undermine Europe's climate goals.""The electric transition remains the objective, but these flexibilities are pragmatic in the current context,"" he told AFP in Tuesday's interview.Germany and Poland had pushed hard for a rollback of the 2035 ban and the right to keep selling combustion engine cars beyond 2035.France was more cautious, fearing the move could stifle Europe's emerging electric battery sector.Sejourne stressed that France had not lost out, noting the 1.5 billion euros ($1.8 billion) in interest-free loans to European battery makers announced as part of the commission's new measures.","European commission agrees to give ground on one of its flagship climate measures.

World's richest just got richer! Elon Musk becomes first person to cross $600 bn net worth — how SpaceX's $800 bn valuation helped,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/worlds-richest-just-got-richer-elon-musk-becomes-first-person-to-cross-600-bn-net-worth-how-spacexs-800-bn-valuation-helped/articleshow/126005918.cms,"Elon Musk became first person ever to have a fortune exceeding $600 billion, with the sharp rise in the value of his companies, particularly SpaceX, driving his net worth to unprecedented levels.The latest jump follows a offer launched by SpaceX earlier this month that values the private rocket company at $800 billion, up from $400 billion in August. The transaction has pushed Musk’s estimated net worth to $677 billion as of midday Monday, according to Forbes. At this level, Musk is now closer to becoming a trillionaire than he is to the world’s second-richest individual.Musk holds an estimated 42% stake in SpaceX, and the revised valuation has added about $168 billion to his personal wealth.No other individual has previously crossed the $600 billion mark, or even reached $500 billion, underscoring the scale of the milestone.Investors say SpaceX is also laying the groundwork for a public listing in 2026, with a potential valuation of around $1.5 trillion. One investor confirmed the IPO target to Forbes, while noting that details of the tender offer and listing plans had already been reported by several outlets.Musk and SpaceX did not respond to Forbes’ requests for comment.The surge has reshaped the composition of Musk’s fortune. His stake in SpaceX is now estimated at $336 billion, making it his most valuable asset. By contrast, his roughly 12% holding in Tesla is valued at $197 billion, excluding stock options tied to his 2018 CEO Performance Award.Those options were invalidated by a Delaware judge in January 2024. While Musk has appealed the decision to the Delaware Supreme Court, Forbes has discounted the value of the options by 50%, placing them at $69 billion pending the outcome of the case.Tesla, however, could still play a decisive role in Musk’s march towards trillionaire status. In November, shareholders approved a record pay package that could award Musk up to $1 trillion in additional Tesla stock, before taxes and the costs of unlocking restricted shares, provided the company meets so-called “Mars shot” performance targets. These include increasing Tesla’s market capitalisation more than eight times over the next decade.Musk’s wealth also extends into artificial intelligence and social media. xAI Holdings, formed in March through the merger of Musk’s AI startup xAI and social media platform X, formerly Twitter, is reportedly seeking fresh funding at a valuation of $230 billion. That figure is more than double the $113 billion valuation Musk cited at the time of the merger. Forbes estimates Musk owns 53% of xAI Holdings, worth around $60 billion.The scale of Musk’s current wealth marks a dramatic rise from just a few years ago. In March 2020, his fortune was estimated at $24.6 billion. A surge in Tesla shares made him the fifth person ever worth $100 billion by August that year. He topped the global rich list for the first time in January 2021 with a net worth approaching $190 billion.Further milestones followed quickly: $200 billion in September 2021, making him only the third person to reach that level after Jeff Bezos and Bernard Arnault; $300 billion in November 2021; $400 billion in December 2024; and $500 billion in October. Only Oracle founder Larry Ellison has also reached the $300 billion and $400 billion thresholds.","Elon musk became first person ever to have a fortune exceeding $600 billion.

Ford EV reset: US carmaker scales back electric ambitions after Trump’s policy rollback; forecasts $19.5 bn write-down,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ford-ev-reset-us-carmaker-scales-back-electric-ambitions-after-trumps-policy-rollback-forecasts-19-5-bn-write-down/articleshow/125993467.cms,"Ford has redrawn its electric vehicle roadmap, announcing that it will pull back from large EVs as the US carmaker transitions towards hybrids, petrol-powered trucks and a new battery storage venture. The auto giant also predicted profits to take a hit of almost $19.5 billion in the next few years.The US automaker, on Monday, said that several large electric models will be dropped, including the F-150 Lightning, as demand has failed to meet expectations amid rising costs and changes in regulation. The decision marks a clear departure from Ford’s earlier EV-heavy ambitions, at a time when the industry is reassessing the pace of the electric transition.“This is a customer-driven shift to create a stronger, more resilient and more profitable Ford,” chief executive Jim Farley said, adding that “the operating reality has changed, and we are redeploying capital into higher-return growth opportunities.”The announcement follows a move by US President Donald Trump to roll back stricter fuel economy rules introduced under former president Joe Biden, which had encouraged US carmakers to accelerate investments in electric vehicles.Farley welcomed the rollback, saying Trump was “aligning fuel economy standards with market realities” and calling it “a win for customers and common sense.”Trump has frequently criticised what he called an EV “mandate”, while Republican lawmakers have also scrapped clean-energy tax credits that had supported EV sales.Going forward, Ford said its electric vehicle development will be limited to smaller, lower-priced models. Production of the current F-150 Lightning has already been stopped, the company said. Its successor will be launched as a hybrid model, pairing an electric battery with a petrol engine and offering a driving range of more than 700 miles.Plans to introduce new electric commercial vans in Europe and North America have also been abandoned. Instead, Ford will produce petrol and hybrid vans at its Ohio assembly plant from 2029. In Tennessee, the company will retool its EV-focused factory, now to be renamed the Tennessee Truck Plant, to build affordable petrol-powered trucks from the same year.As part of its broader reset, Ford is also entering the battery energy storage market. A plant in Kentucky will be converted to manufacture storage systems for data centres and power utilities. The company expects to invest around $2 billion over two years in the project and aims to reach an annual capacity of 20 gigawatt-hours by late 2027, positioning itself as a significant player in the fast-growing sector.","Ford will stop production of the f-150 lightning, a large electric vehicle.

H-1B Showdown: Amazon, Google Microsoft Pour Billions Into India as 20 States Sue Trump

US President Donald Trump’s $100,000 price tag for new H-1B workers hired from outside the US will have punishing effects for the IT outsourcing and staffing industries that have long been a target of both parties.The fee is the biggest restriction the Trump administration has imposed so far on employment of skilled foreign workers.A Bloomberg analysis found it will have a disproportionate impact on multinational staffing firms that act as middlemen for companies seeking H-1B workers. Those middlemen include TCS Infosys , and Cognizant.Almost 90% of new H-1B hires at those three companies between May 2020 and May 2024 were approved at US consulates.The workers would have cost each of them hundreds of millions more if the fee had been in effect.More than 93% of new Infosys H-1B hires in that timeframe — upwards of 10,400 workers — would have been hit with the $100,000 fee, the Bloomberg analysis showed, adding up to more than a billion dollars in visa charges.TCS would have had to pay the fee for 6,500 workers over that period, or 82% of newly approved H-1B workers. Cognizant would be faced with the charge for more than 5,600 employees, or 89% of new H-1B hires.Even if legal challenges are successful in quickly blocking the fee, industry observers expect it will to lead to a steep drop in visa demand and drive placement of more workers overseas.Large tech and IT firms have traditionally dominated the H-1B programme, the primary pathway to US careers for foreign workers with at least a bachelor’s degree. They claim most of the 85,000 visa slots available each year.Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have claimed that companies use the programme as a cheap alternative to American workers, although H-1B employees must be paid a “prevailing wage” for their industry and early-career H-1B workers typically garner well above the US median wage.Workers from outside the US, rather than recent international graduates of US colleges already in the country, accounted for more than four out of 10 new H-1B hires approved over the past four years, data analysed by Bloomberg showed.",The fee is the biggest restriction the trump administration has imposed so far on employment of skilled foreign workers.
