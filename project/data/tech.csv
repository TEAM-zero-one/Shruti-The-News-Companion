SEC’s new TV deal with ESPN creates a major divide in the NCAA gymnastics



The Southeastern Conference (SEC) has changed the NCAA gymnastics broadcast picture with its latest 2026 announcement. Every SEC program will receive full-season coverage across ESPN networks. This means fans across the country will see SEC teams every week, while most other NCAA programs get little to no national exposure. The change creates a clear visibility gap even before the season begins.The opening schedule reveals the imbalance right away. The 2026 season starts with the Sprouts Farmers Market Collegiate Quad on ABC and ESPN2 on January 10. After that, SEC teams dominate the national broadcast windows on ESPN2 and SEC Network from mid-January to late February. Even top programs outside the SEC, such as Oklahoma, appear far less. As the season moves forward, non-SEC teams get only scattered opportunities to be on national television.The SEC’s expanded TV coverage may have a profound impact on the NCAA gymnastics. The conference now has full-season national exposure that no other league comes close to. ESPN and the SEC Network provide strong production, wide reach, and prime-time slots.This gives SEC athletes more chances to be seen by fans, scouts, and sponsors.Even Oklahoma, one of the sport’s most successful programs, highlights the contrast. The Sooners announced eight nationally televised meets for 2026. It is a strong lineup, but it still does not match the SEC’s season-long coverage. Five of Oklahoma’s regular-season meets will air on the SEC Network, yet their non-SEC opponents will not get the same visibility. This leaves most programs across the country with limited national airtime.This imbalance could impact recruiting. Since more TV time can also help athletes grow their NIL value. When athletes appear regularly on ESPN platforms, brands notice. More viewers also means stronger social media followings.The NCAA Championships will still air on ESPN+, ESPN2, and ABC. The NCAA Championship Preview Show and the NCAA Championship final on April 18, 2026, will also air on ABC. But the SEC Network remains the main home for Friday Night Heights.The long-term concern is whether non-SEC athletes will lose opportunities. Less TV time can mean fewer sponsors, weaker recruiting power, and slower program growth. The SEC’s broadcast strength may lift its teams even higher while others struggle to keep up.Also Read: Simone Biles drops jaw-dropping $90K flex on Chicago Bears sidelines while celebrating husband Jonathan Owens’ win","The southeastern conference (sec) has changed the ncaa gymnastics broadcast picture with its latest 2026 announcement.

Cloudflare down: OpenAI, Twitter, Spotify, Canva, Claude and other big businesses that Cloudflare outage 'disrupted'

I won’t mince words: earlier today we failed our customers and the broader Internet when a problem in @Cloudflare network impacted large amounts of traffic that rely on us. The sites, businesses, and organizations that rely on Cloudflare depend on us being available and I apologize for the impact that we caused.

Transparency about what happened matters, and we plan to share a breakdown with more details in a few hours. In short, a latent bug in a service underpinning our bot mitigation capability started to crash after a routine configuration change we made. That cascaded into a broad degradation to our network and other services. This was not an attack.

That issue, impact it caused, and time to resolution is unacceptable. Work is already underway to make sure it does not happen again, but I know it caused real pain today. The trust our customers place in us is what we value the most and we are going to do what it takes to earn that back.

Users of several popular websites, including X (formerly Twitter) and OpenAI ’s ChatGPT, have reported facing issues. The content delivery network provider, Cloudflare, is causing this multi-platform disruption. The company’s official status page has also confirmed the ongoing service degradation. According to the outage-tracking website Downdetector, the disruption began around 6:00 AM ET (4.30 pm IST) when an issue with Cloudflare's support portal provider surfaced, quickly spreading to broader service problems. Users trying to access affected sites are encountering difficulties, such as being unable to load posts on X, to use design tools like Canva and chatbots like ChatGPT, or to access specific online games like League of Legends.In many cases, users attempting to reach these websites have reported being blocked by a generic message, such aswhich prevents access to the protected site. This message indicates that the security and challenge systems provided by Cloudflare are malfunctioning, even though the underlying websites themselves may remain operational.The current downtime is tied directly to the issues Cloudflare is experiencing with its systems.The provider's role in delivering content and managing security challenges means its operational status impacts a wide range of internet services that rely on its network infrastructure.In its official status page, Cloudflare initially wrote:Later on, the company shared:Cloudflare sits behind a substantial portion of the modern internet. It powers content delivery, security protections and tools that keep websites online during traffic spikes or cyber attacks. When its systems fail, the impact ripples far beyond any single service.

Why AI professionals are thinking that OpenAI may turn out to be a ‘flop’





OpenAI's Master Plan for India

""How can a company with $13 billion in revenues make $1.4 trillion of spend commitments?""

""If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. Enough,”

""Geeze, it sounds more like the judgmental valley conference.""





ChatGPT maker OpenAI was voted among the startups with potential to 'FAIL' in an informal survey at the Cerebral Valley AI Conference. The result offers an unexpected perspective on the ChatGPT maker that has $100-plus valuation. The survey asked founders and investors which AI startup they would be willing to bet against, a question not typically raised so openly in Silicon Valley. AI search startup Perplexity received the most votes, followed by ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Meanwhile, when the audience was asked whether they could invest in any private technology company, most people voted for the Claude maker Anthropic, while OpenAI took second place.According to a Business Insider report, independent journalist Eric Newcomer conducted the survey by gathering responses from more than 300 attendees before panels featuring other major AI companies, such as Anthropic and xAI. This shows that some industry professionals are becoming more cautious about the success of AI startups. Even with a lot of money going into AI, there is now some doubt about how well certain big companies in the field will do.OpenAI taking second place on the list may seem unexpected because it is often viewed as a consumer-focused leader in the AI space. However, its rapidly rising valuation and significant infrastructure costs have raised concerns for some investors. Even though Sam Altman has acknowledged the possibility of an AI bubble, OpenAI CEO rejected the idea that his company’s valuation is overstated during a recent conversation with investor Brad Gerstner.Gerstner asked Altman at the interview.Altman replied.Altman noted that interest in the company remains strong. In fact, both OpenAI and Perplexity were popular choices in another part of the survey that asked which companies respondents would be willing to bet on.Perplexity, which also offers an AI-powered search browser, is aiming to compete with Google, and being ranked first on the list is not unexpected.Perplexity has become a typical example in discussions about the possibility of an AI bubble, as it has raised frequent funding rounds and attracted strong investor interest at valuations reported to range from $14 billion to $50 billion, according to the report.When asked about the Cerebral Valley survey, Perplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer responded in an email:However, it's important to note that any informal, anonymous survey should be viewed cautiously. Yet, the results offer insight into private opinions, as many founders and investors discuss concerns about an AI bubble but rarely mention specific companies.Unlike public markets, private investors do not typically bet against startups, and openly criticising a company without clear justification is generally discouraged in Silicon Valley.","Chatgpt maker openai was voted among the startups with potential to 'fail' in an informal survey at the cerebral valley ai conference.

A video of long queues of wheelchair-bound people, visibly Indians, at some airport has triggered a massive social media controversy with Indians getting hate from all corners because of what social media users are calling ""new scam"". The viral post claimed Air India said 30% of passengers on India-US flights ask for wheelchairs and most of them are able-bodied travelers ""scamming the priority boarding system"" while those who really need a wheelchair don't get it.The same X account, claiming to be from Canada, posted another video of Indians ""taking all the wheelchairs at airports"". ""If they are doing this at airports, do you think our elderly are being scammed by them in our healthcare system too?"" the post read.""If they do that to board, imagine what theyll scam once theyre here,"" one wrote.Indian entrepreneur Kiran Mazumdar-Shaw reacted to the viral video and suggested that wheelchair at airport should come at a cost. ""They should charge an additional Rs 5000 per airport n then they will see how many genuine passengers there are!"" Shaw wrote.Shaw received flak for amplifying India-hatred on X and her suggestion was called inconvenient for people who are not faking their disability. Also, many users pointed out that there is no evidence to prove that they were all faking it. One user claimed that it is not about walking at the airport but the process because of which Indians get wheelchairs for their parents as they don't know English. ""It is not about walking it is about the process. Most indian parents don't know english and dont know where to go so their children book wheelchair so they can go to security clearance, terminal change and baggage collection area without tension,"" one wrote.","A viral video shamed indians claiming that they fake disability and book wheelchairs at foreign airports.

"'Heavy debt, rising costs': UK’s largest pub group to sell around thousand sites; eyes deal worth 1 billion pounds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/heavy-debt-rising-costs-uks-largest-pub-group-to-sell-around-thousand-sites-eyes-deal-worth-1-billion-pounds/articleshow/125378123.cms,"Stonegate Group, the UK's largest pub operator, is reportedly considering selling approximately 1,000 of its most profitable ""platinum"" pubs for an estimated £1 billion. This move aims to address the company's substantial £3 billion debt burden. The sale of these separately structured sites would not impact the rest of Stonegate's extensive estate.





Stonegate Group, the UK’s largest pub operator and owner of chains including Slug & Lettuce and Be At One, is reportedly considering the sale of around 1,000 sites in a deal potentially worth 1 billion pounds, Independent reported.The move comes as the group seeks to address an estimated 3 billion pounds in accumulated debts.According to Independent, the sites under consideration form a portfolio of the group’s most profitable pubs, often described as its “platinum” collection. These pubs are structured as a separate entity within Stonegate, allowing a sale without affecting the rest of its estate of 4,300 sites. Executives are consulting advisers on options, including selling the pubs in smaller groups rather than in a single transaction.A Stonegate spokesperson told The Sun that no pubs are at risk of closure and all sites will continue to operate under the Stonegate brand. Analysts note that many UK pub chains remain under pressure, with several, such as Oakman Inns & Restaurants, entering administration earlier this year due to elevated costs and reduced revenue.Stonegate’s financial difficulties date back to its 2019 merger with rival company Ei, which left the group heavily indebted just months before the Covid-19 lockdown severely impacted the hospitality sector.Attempts to sell some sites in previous years were unsuccessful, and the group instead refinanced the platinum pubs with a 638 million pounds loan from private equity firm Apollo. The end of a non-call period on this loan in January could allow Stonegate to pursue a potential sale, The Independent reported.Chief executive David McDowall, who joined the company from BrewDog in 2023, had outlined a “transformation plan” to return Stonegate to profitability. Despite these measures, the company posted a 214 million pounds loss in 2024.The wider UK hospitality industry too continues to face challenges from high operating costs, rising energy and food prices, increased national insurance contributions, and the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on customer spending.","Stonegate group, the uk's largest pub operator, is reportedly considering the sale of around 1,000 sites in a deal potentially worth 1 billion pounds.

Fujian Vs Ford: China Unveils Its Most Advanced Carrier, Reshaping Indo-Pacific Power Balance





PARIS: China's CO2 emissions remained flat in the third quarter as power generation from solar energy surged and electric car use continued to grow, a study showed on Tuesday.Emissions from the world's biggest polluter have now been flat or falling for 18 straight months, said the analysis published by climate news specialist Carbon Brief.""After the first three quarters of the year, China's CO2 emissions in 2025 are now finely balanced between a small fall or rise, depending on what happens in the last quarter,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.""A drop in the full-year total became much more likely after September, which recorded an approximately three percent drop in emissions year-on-year,"" said Myllyvirta, who is also a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute.The new analysis, which is based on official Chinese data, comes as the UN's COP30 climate conference kicked off in Brazil on Monday.""While an emission increase or decrease of one percent or less might not make a huge difference in an objective sense, it has heightened symbolic meaning,"" Myllyvirta said.""China's policymakers have left room for emissions to increase for several more years, leaving the timing of the peak open,"" he added.Emissions from the power sector, China's dominant source of CO2, remained flat in the third quarter despite strong demand for electricity, Myllyvirta said.Electricity generation from solar energy rose 46 percent while wind grew 11 percent compared to the same period last year.Emissions from transport fuel dropped by five percent, with declines also in cement and steel production.Oil demand and emissions grew elsewhere by 10 percent as the production of plastics and other chemicals surged, the analysis found.In September, China issued its first-ever absolute targets for cutting planet-warming gases.Under the new plan, China will reduce economy-wide emissions by seven to 10 percent by 2035 relative to the year of the country's peak emissions, believed to be 2025.China had previously pledged to peak its carbon output before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, without ever previously setting near-term numerical targets for total emissions reductions.",Emissions from the world's biggest polluter have now been flat or falling for 18 straight months.

A private royal zoo and wildlife conservation efforts





Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Crown Prince of Dubai, is not just a figurehead of royalty—he is a man of extraordinary wealth, influence, and interests. With an estimated personal net worth ranging from $1 billion to $2 billion, Sheikh Hamdan is one of the wealthiest and most influential royals in the world. This fortune is drawn from a variety of sources, including luxurious real estate, superyachts, private jets, and rare car collections. However, these estimates often focus only on his personal assets, and his actual wealth is likely far greater when considering his family's assets and the extensive holdings tied to the Al Maktoum family.In fact, some reports generally estimate that the Al Maktoum family, led by Sheikh Hamdan's father, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, has a net worth that ranges between $14 billion to $18 billion, a figure that is widely cited but likely underestimates the full scale of their wealth. In reality, due to the notably private nature of royal assets and the discreetly managed lack of public disclosures, the family's true wealth could be potentially much higher than these estimates.Sheikh Hamdan's personal net worth, estimated between $1 billion and $2 billion, is significant but only scratches the surface of his family's total wealth. His fortune is tied to a combination of private investments, his role as Crown Prince, and assets across various industries. Below is a breakdown of his key wealth sources:Sheikh Hamdan’s love for luxury yachts is well known, and he is the proud owner of several high-end vessels:In addition to his yachts, Sheikh Hamdan has access to private jets and notably, a Boeing 747-400 from the Dubai Royal Air Wing, valued between $100 million to $270 million, offering luxurious interiors for personal and official traveSheikh Hamdan is renowned for his collection of luxury cars, many of which are limited-edition supercars. His garage reportedly includes:Along with his love for high-performance sports cars, Sheikh Hamdan has an affinity for luxury SUVs, particularly the Mercedes AMG G63, which is said to be his favourite vehicle.Sheikh Hamdan’s wealth extends far beyond cars and yachts; he is also deeply invested in real estate. His properties span Dubai and include:Sheikh Hamdan’s wealth is not confined to personal residences; his real estate investments form a substantial part of his overall fortune. Through Zabeel Investments and other holdings, he has acquired a mix of luxury residential towers, commercial developments, mansion compounds, and hospitality assets. These investments reflect both his personal tastes for opulence and his strategic role in shaping Dubai’s urban and economic landscape.This estimate combines his official residences, private estates, high-value real estate projects, and luxury lifestyle assets such as superyachts and jets. While these numbers provide a snapshot of Sheikh Hamdan’s tangible wealth, his actual financial influence and holdings likely extend far beyond these figures, particularly when considering his family’s overall fortune and the value of assets tied to the Al Maktoum dynasty.Sheikh Hamdan’s love for animals is well known, and he compassionately maintains an exclusive private zoo separate from Zabeel Palace. Located near Nad Al Sheba and close to the serene Dubai Desert Conservation Reserve, this private zoo houses a remarkably diverse collection of exotic animals, including white lions, giraffes, elephants, and tigers. The zoo is carefully and meticulously designed with state-of-the-art facilities, including specialized veterinary care and spacious habitats tailored to support the thriving needs of the animals.In addition to his exotic collection, Sheikh Hamdan is a passionate falconer, preserving and promoting falconry—a treasured Emirati heritage sport. He owns a private falconry centre equipped with a specialized falcon hospital, providing surgeries, X-rays, and emergency care for his prized birds. The Crown Prince actively participates in falconry competitions such as the Fazza Championship for Falconry and supports international exhibitions, showcasing his commitment to sustaining this centuries-old tradition.Sheikh Hamdan frequently shares rare glimpses of his animal kingdom and falconry pursuits on Instagram, where his 17 million+ followers see him interacting playfully with elephants, giraffes, lions, and majestic falcons. These posts highlight not only his love for wildlife but also his active role in conservation and cultural preservation efforts.","Sheikh hamdan has made considerable investments in real estate and commercial ventures, particularly in the luxury property market.

Jasontheween clip choice triggers online debate as creators speak out





QTCinderella is facing a big wave of backlash after announcing the nominees for The Streamer Awards 2025 on November 16, 2025, during a livestream on Twitch. She revealed more than 35 categories, including “Best Just Chatting Streamer,” “Best VTuber,” and “Streamer of the Year. ” The list included many well-known creators such as Jasontheween from FaZe Clan, IShowSpeed, and Kai Cenat. This event is one of the largest fan-driven shows in the streaming world, so many viewers were watching closely as every category was revealed.But soon after QTCinderella finished her livestream, the online reaction turned negative. The problem started with the clips used for Jasontheween’s nominations. Fans on X said the clips felt strange and uncomfortable, especially because they showed him with two different creators he had partnered with in the past. Many viewers felt the choice of clips was disrespectful, and this quickly grew into a much bigger debate about how the awards were handled.Jasontheween worked with influencer Shizuku in early 2025, and their fans often joked about the pair becoming a couple. But that never happened, and months later, Jason began appearing with Sakura Shymko.They created several viral moments in mid-2025, and Sakura later confirmed they were in a relationship.Viewers were surprised when QTCinderella used a clip of Jason with Shizuku and then immediately placed a clip of him with Sakura for his “Best Just Chatting Streamer” nomination.Jasontheween reacted right away on stream. He said, “Are you deada** QT? I got a whole girlfriend. What the actual fk? Who put these clips together, bro?” His comments spread fast across social media on November 16, 2025.Later that night, QTCinderella responded in a very emotional livestream and said, “You’re so fking mad about one clip… Don’t support my f**king show then. Don’t vote for him… We’re doing our best.”More creators joined the conversation. Asmongold accused QTCinderella of “lying,” saying she picked nominees to keep sponsors happy.Felix “xQc” Lengyel also said the awards felt biased, especially after seeing Vanillamace nominated for “Best Breakout Streamer.”Also Read: IShowSpeed Leaves Viewers Stunned After DNA Results Uncover Shocking Truth About His Real Heritage And Identity He said QTCinderella may have added her because of their past drama. Kick streamer Adin Ross also said the awards were “not fan-voted,” pointing out that some names were unfamiliar to many viewers.Political commentator HasanAbi also added that he was surprised not to be nominated, since he believed 2025 was his most “impactful” year of streaming.","Qtcinderella announced nominees for the streamer awards 2025 on november 16, 2025.

RaKai’s livestream actions spark online guesses after Twitch suspension







RaKai, who is known online as “2xRaKai,” has been banned from Twitch for the third time. The news came out on November 17, 2025, when the automated account @StreamerBans on X posted that Twitch had suspended his channel again. RaKai is a close friend of streamer Kai Cenat and often appears in videos with him. This new suspension quickly grabbed attention because RaKai is only 16 years old and already has a long list of bans.Soon after the news spread, fans began talking about the suspension on X. People started sharing their own ideas about what happened during his live stream and why Twitch removed his account again. Many viewers said they saw some moments on his stream that might have caused the latest ban.Fans on X shared many different thoughts about what RaKai did on his stream on November 17, 2025. One user named @mrgodo54 wrote that he believed RaKai “humped the camera” and also used a firework indoors, which can break Twitch rules.Another user, @yoxics, posted that RaKai was banned because he “lit fireworks in his room” during his live broadcast. A third user, @CloverboysLIVE, who follows RaKai closely, said that RaKai was already trying to get unbanned and would return to streaming “once the ban gets lifted.”Some fans also mentioned another clip involving a device. One user, @SamPromise28, asked if this ban happened because RaKai was “dry humping the camera.”Another person, @KNavikay, said the “fire gun” he used is meant only for adults, which could be the reason for the ban. Many viewers reacted strongly, with one user, @racing_dun45939, saying the ban was deserved and asking Twitch to keep him off the platform longer.Twitch streamer Tylil James spoke to his viewers on the same day, November 17, 2025, to explain the situation. He said RaKai was only serving a one-day suspension and told fans not to worry.Also Read: IShowSpeed Leaves Viewers Stunned After DNA Results Uncover Shocking Truth About His Real Heritage And Identity Tylil said, “The ban is going to be uplifted tomorrow.

After a 3-year ban, SteveWillDoIt is finally back with major comeback plans





SteveWillDoIt’s long-awaited return to YouTube has officially become reality, marking the end of a three-year absence that left one of the platform’s most talked-about creators sidelined. His original channel was permanently removed in August 2022 due to repeated violations of YouTube’s Community Guidelines, primarily involving gambling-related promotions. In the years since, Steve stayed active on Instagram and Kick, but the void on YouTube, his biggest stage, has remained a major talking point among fans. Now, with a comeback date set for December 24 at 8:30 PM ET, anticipation is running higher than ever as he steps back into the spotlight.His return doesn’t just mark a new upload; it marks a new era. Steve admitted that the past three years were emotionally brutal, saying he had been depressed and felt he had lost his purpose without YouTube. The announcement has reignited his massive fanbase, and his new channel, currently blank with no videos or profile photo, is already attracting heavy traffic from viewers hoping to witness his next big chapter unfold.The core of SteveWillDoIt’s return revolves around two major things: the impact of his ban and the massive scale of his comeback plans. His original removal from the platform stemmed from YouTube flagging multiple instances of gambling promotion, including unblurred URLs to betting sites. The termination hit Steve harder than many realized, as he later shared that YouTube was his life's passion, and losing the channel left him directionless.Now, he’s aiming to come back bigger than ever. Steve revealed that once his new channel hits one million subscribers, he will give away one million dollars to one single person, a signature blend of chaos and generosity that defined his earlier rise. He’s kicking things off with a Christmas special, followed by what he describes as a full TV show experience. This signals not just a return, but an expansion of his creative ambitions and production scale.SteveWillDoIt’s comeback is shaping up to be one of the biggest creators returns the platform has seen in years. From overcoming a difficult three-year ban to teasing high-budget content and massive giveaways, he’s stepping back into YouTube with renewed purpose and fan-driven momentum. With his first upload scheduled for December 24, all eyes are on the blank new channel that’s already generating buzz, and if history is any indication, his return may just break the internet again.Also Read: QTCinderella faces backlash as Asmongold and Tectone question fairness of the streamer awards","After a 3-year ban, stevewilldoit is finally back with major comeback plans.
