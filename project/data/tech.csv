With ChatGPT maker OpenAI's latest GPT-4o update sparking a viral trend of Studio Ghibli-style portraits , social media is buzzing with ethereal, anime-inspired images. However, this feature, rolled out on Tuesday, March 25, is currently limited to ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Team, and Select subscription tiers, leaving free-tier users out of the fun—at least for now. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced Wednesday that overwhelming demand has delayed the feature's rollout to free users, meaning those on the basic plan can't tap into the native image-generation capabilities of GPT-4o or Sora. But don't worry: you don't need ChatGPT Plus to join the Ghibli fest.AI models like Gemini or Grok can also create Studio Ghibli-style visuals—think lush greenery, soft lighting, and expressive characters—provided you're precise with your prompts, such as ""a serene Ghibli-style girl with flowing hair under a cherry blossom tree.""However, the output might differ from ChatGPT's GPT-4o creations, as each model interprets styles uniquely due to differences in training data and algorithms. While ChatGPT's images lean toward photorealistic finesse, Gemini, Grok, or trial-based platforms might produce a slightly more abstract or varied take on Ghibli's charm, requiring some experimentation to nail the vibe.You can still transform your photos or ideas into Studio Ghibli-inspired art without a ChatGPT subscription. Free platforms like Craiyon, DeepAI, and Playground AI offer AI image generation with varying levels of customization. Simply upload a photo or type a prompt like ""portrait in Studio Ghibli style, lush forest background, soft colors,"" and let the AI work its magic.Again, these tools may not match GPT-4o's photorealistic precision, but they can mimic Ghibli's whimsical aesthetic—think flowing hair, vibrant landscapes, and gentle expressions. For better control, try Artbreeder, which lets you blend images and tweak styles, though some features require a paid upgrade.If you're aiming for higher quality, platforms like Runway ML, Leonardo AI, or Mage.space offer free trials that rival ChatGPT's capabilities. Sign up, upload your image, and use prompts to emulate Ghibli's signature look—dreamy lighting, hand-drawn textures, and nature-infused scenes. These tools often provide more advanced editing options, letting you refine details like Totoro-esque fluffiness or Spirited Away-inspired hues.While ChatGPT Plus users revel in OpenAI's loosened style restrictions, these workarounds prove you don't need a subscription to create Ghibli magic. Experiment, share your results, and join the trend—subscription or not.","Chatgpt maker openai's latest gpt-4o update sparked a viral trend of studio ghibli-style portraits.

Skywatchers and astronomy enthusiasts are in for a spectacular celestial event as a partial solar eclipse is set to occur on March 29, 2025. This breathtaking phenomenon will follow a total lunar eclipse that took place just weeks earlier, adding to the excitement for stargazers. The eclipse will be particularly visible across parts of the northeastern United States and Canada, where observers will witness the moon partially obscuring the sun at sunrise, creating a stunning crescent-like effect.Unlike a total solar eclipse, where the moon completely blocks the sun, a partial eclipse leaves a portion of the sun visible, offering a unique viewing experience. This event will be visible to over 800 million people worldwide, making it one of the most widely observed astronomical occurrences of 2025. With proper precautions and the right viewing locations, this solar eclipse promises to be a memorable spectacle.According to Space.com, the March 29, 2025, solar eclipse will occur between 4:50 a.m. and 8:43 a.m. Eastern Time (ET). The event will be best visible at sunrise across several states in the northeastern U.S. and parts of Canada.The following states will have some of the best views of the partial solar eclipse, as reported by USA Today:Additionally, the eclipse will be visible across Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vermont, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. However, visibility will depend on local weather conditions, so clear skies will be essential for an optimal viewing experience.A partial solar eclipse occurs when the moon moves between the Earth and the sun, but its alignment is not perfect, causing only a portion of the sun to be obscured. The extent to which the sun is covered depends on the observer's location. During this event, the moon will appear to take a ""bite"" out of the sun, producing a crescent-like visual effect.Although partial eclipses do not create the dramatic darkness of a total eclipse, they remain fascinating astronomical events. Observers will notice shadows appearing sharper, temperature drops, and changes in animal behavior during the peak of the eclipse.The March 29, 2025, eclipse is part of a series of solar eclipses that occur as the Earth, moon, and sun align at specific intervals. The moon’s orbital tilt prevents solar eclipses from occurring every month, making them relatively rare events.During a partial solar eclipse, the sun is never fully covered, and the extent of the obscuration depends on the observer's position on Earth. The phenomenon is a reminder of the intricate mechanics of celestial bodies and their predictable yet mesmerizing movements.At sunrise, when the eclipse reaches its peak in North America, the sun will appear as a thin crescent, giving the impression that a large portion of it has been ""bitten off."" As the moon moves along its orbit, the sun will gradually regain its full shape, marking the end of the event.Unlike lunar eclipses, which are safe to view with the naked eye, solar eclipses require special protective measures. Looking directly at the sun, even during a partial eclipse, can cause severe retinal damage, often referred to as ""eclipse blindness.""To safely observe the eclipse, experts recommend using:Standard sunglasses are not sufficient for protection and should not be used. Organizations such as NASA and the American Astronomical Society provide guidelines on purchasing certified eclipse glasses to ensure safe viewing.The partial solar eclipse will occur on March 29, 2025, between 4:50 a.m. and 8:43 a.m. Eastern Time (ET). It will be best visible at sunrise across the northeastern United States and parts of Canada. Some of the key locations for optimal viewing include New York, Massachusetts, Maine, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Virginia, among others.A partial solar eclipse occurs when the moon moves between the Earth and the sun but does not fully cover it. This results in a portion of the sun remaining visible, creating a crescent-like effect. In contrast, a total solar eclipse occurs when the moon completely obscures the sun, briefly turning day into night.Viewing a solar eclipse requires proper eye protection. Experts recommend using eclipse glasses that meet ISO 12312-2 safety standards, solar viewing filters, or indirect viewing methods such as pinhole projectors. Standard sunglasses are not safe for eclipse viewing, as they do not provide adequate protection against harmful UV rays.Solar eclipses are rare because the moon’s orbit is tilted relative to the Earth's orbit around the sun. This means that the moon, Earth, and sun do not always align perfectly. Eclipses only occur when their orbits intersect at specific points, leading to either partial or total solar eclipses.Yes, during the peak of the eclipse, observers may notice subtle environmental changes such as a slight drop in temperature, sharper shadows, and altered animal behavior. These effects occur because the reduced sunlight affects both the atmosphere and the natural world.","A partial solar eclipse will occur on march 29, 2025, in the northeastern u.s. and parts of canada.

We have to analyse them, take views on different elements, go back and consult other departments, and make other necessary changes before finalising them.

Krishnan was unequivocal about the legal framework in place.""India has laws today where we can actually block content if needed. Section 69A of the IT Act gives us those powers. If content violates other laws but doesn't fall within 69A, provisions under Section 79 can be applied,"" he said.

The move by the Trump administration to impose 25% tariff on key automobile components from May 2025, will compress the operating margins of Indian component manufacturer-exporters by 125-150 basis points (100bps = 1 percentage point) from 12–12.5% range, assuming full absorption of tariffs, Crisil Ratings senior director Anuj Sethi said.“About a fifth of the revenue of India’s auto component sector is derived from exports.

Macquarie has initiated its coverage of Trent with an ‘outperform’ rating and a target price of Rs 7,000. Analysts said that company was India's leading fashion retailer in the value to mid-premium space. Trent also leads Asian peers on growth, return profile and inventory turns. They see this sustaining as an integrated back-end allowing quicker fashion-forward style drops and part new stores. The company has best retailing metrics among Asian peers and it’s a play on India's rising discretionary spend in fashion.HSBC has a ‘buy’ call on Adani Ports & SEZ with a target price of Rs 1,600. Analysts said Adani Ports reiterated its EBITDA guidance of Rs 18,800-18,900 crore for FY25. The company emphasised its ambition to become an integrated end-to-end logistics services provider.

Analysts said that company won its biggest ever EPC contract recently, valued at over $4 billion for an offshore gas project from Qatarenergy LNG. This adds to its over backlog by 6.6%. This contract clearly takes L&T into the big leagues of global EPC, capable of handling multi-billion dollar contracts.JPMorgan has an ‘overweight’ call on HAL with a target price of Rs 4,958. Analysts said GE Aerospace has started delivery of F404-IN20 engines for LCA MK1A fighter aircrafts to HAL. This delayed delivery of engines has been an overhang on HAL. So now with the delivery starting, overhang has been lifted.

As India looks set to become the world’s fourth largest economy next year, and the third largest in the later part of this decade, we take a look at 7 charts that show the incredible growth story of India and ask experts about what led to the 100% rise in GDP:

India’s Rise in numbers

India’s nominal GDP in 2015 was $2,103.6 billion. Come 2025, the IMF projects that it will reach $4,271.9 billion. That's over 100% growth in just 10 years!

Among the top 10 largest world economies, India has exhibited the highest growth in GDP. Three out of the present top 4 world economies have seen a decent GDP growth in 10 years; 65.8% for the US, 75.8% for China and 43.7% for Germany. Japan’s economy has contracted 1.3% in the last 10 years, as per IMF’s October 2024 World Economic Outlook.

Back in 2014, India was the world’s 10th largest economy in terms of nominal GDP. From there, it has risen through the ranks to become the world’s 5th largest economy - a feat it achieved in 2021.

A recent SBI Research report notes that with the government's efforts to ensure quality of life for all citizens and stopped leakage of benefits through Direct Benefit Transfer, the per capita GDP at current prices stood at Rs 2.35 lakh in FY25, with decadal CAGR growth of 9.1%. “In constant prices too, per capita GDP has increased to Rs 1.33 lakh in FY25. In the last two fiscals, the per capita GDP jumped by more than Rs 40,000 at current prices,” says the SBI Research report.

When will India become the world's 3rd largest economy?

India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has doubled in the last 10 years - a huge feat for an economy that is also set to become the world’s third largest in a few years. India’s economic growth has come despite a major economic setback in the form of the Covid pandemic a few years ago.According to latest International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) data, India’s GDP under the Narendra Modi government has seen 103.1% growth in GDP at current prices or nominal GDP. It has also gone from being the world’s 10th largest economy to the fifth largest.How has India managed to double its GDP in just ten years? What factors have worked to propel the economy, which at one time had been infamously ranked among the ‘Fragile Five’?Suggesting strong economic fundamentals, India will continue to be the fastest growing major economy in the coming years as well, says IMF. It has projected that India’s GDP will grow at 6.5% in both FY 2025 and FY 2026.All other top 10 world economies will grow at much lower rates - with China projected to see the second highest GDP growth rate of 4.5%.With a healthy GDP growth rate, the Indian economy is expected to surpass Japan in 2026 as the world’s 4th largest economy. It is likely to become the third largest economy in the world in nominal GDP terms by 2028, according to IMF projections.India’s GDP is expected to rise to $5723.3 billion by 2028 and $6307.2 billion by 2029. In 2029, the world’s largest economy, the US, is projected to have a GDP of $35458 billion - which is 5.62 times India’s GDP!In the interactive chart above, we take a look at India's rise from 2015 to 2029 (projected). The GDP data for US and China is not highlighted since they will continue to the top two world economies through these years.Economists credit the government policies and reforms with focus on manufacturing sector, exports, digitalization, GST and capital expenditure push for the infrastructure sector as major reasons for the astounding rise in nominal GDP numbers.Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Bank of Baroda says a number of factors have come together to enable this rather remarkable growth in the Indian economy:Agriculture has been very resilient in this decade notwithstanding erratic climatic conditions. This is something which has kept output ticking as well as rural incomes stable.India Inc has delivered quite well over the years in terms of expansion of business, investment, employment and diversification. This has created a very strong industrial sector. Several industries are a part of global supply chains.The government has provided a very facilitative framework for business through a plethora of policies like Make in India, PLI, tax regime, MSME loans etc, he tells TOI.a. At the same time the upliftment for the lower segments through direct measures has elevated standard of living as comes out from the consumption survey data.b. The widespread use of technology though the digitization process has cut down on cost and ensured transparency in dealings.c. GST has been a major breakthrough which has improved transparency.d. The fiscal deficit has been brought under control with the focus being on prudence which has allowed the government to spend more on capex.Also Read | Trump tariffs impact: Is a US recession likely and does India need to worry about it? The services sector has been a major driver of the economy.a. The service export component has been a major driver of growth.b. The logistics and retail segments have seen exponential growth with demand being robust.The RBI has brought about a sea change in different areas.a. Made the banking system resilient and robust by leaning up balance sheets of banks.b. Brought in pro-active regulation to ensure stability of the system.c. Monetary policy streamlined on global standards with MPC to fight inflation.The large flow of FDI has supplemented domestic capital and enhanced investment in the country.The capital market has enabled raising of both equity and debt which is required for financing investment in the country. Here the regulator SEBI has been proactive all through to ensure there are no mis-steps.“Therefore, the story is one of pragmatic polices, prudent regulation, successful business entrepreneurship which has moulded well in the process of globalization,” he tells TOI.Also Read | Why Jim Walker, man who foresaw 2008 market crash, wants investors to ‘absolutely double down’ on Indian equities According to Dharmakirti Joshi, Chief Economist at Crisil, “The government's emphasis on infrastructure development has contributed to higher-than-expected GDP growth following the pandemic. The introduction of GST enhanced tax compliance and increased government revenues, enabling greater budgetary spending on infrastructure.”DK Joshi also believes that the rapid advancements in digital infrastructure have facilitated efficient payment systems, quicker credit delivery, and fostered innovation. “The healthy balance sheets of banks have also supported faster credit growth,” he tells TOI.Radhika Rao, Senior Economist at DBS Bank notes that in the past decade, there has been a strong focus towards higher capital expenditure from the government as well as households, with the latter reflected in rising contribution to real estate and construction.She credits the successive budgets that have seen a sharp increase in capex outlays, which has positive multipliers for the economy while the stickier revenue expenditure has been gradually rationalised.“Concurrently, the composition of external trade has also undergone a change with rising share of manufactured goods in exports and strong gains in services, led by the contribution of global capability centres. These have not only helped make the net export balance less negative but have also helped to improve the health of the current account balance,” she tells TOI.Also Read | Donald Trump's tariffs: India may be among least vulnerable Asian economies in trade war with US - but there's a catch!

The economy has recovered well from the GDP growth slowdown of Q2 FY2025, with a 6.2% growth in the third quarter.India looks set to rank among the top three economies in the coming years. But in a world of increasing economic uncertainties, and the threat of US tariffs looming, it will have to proactively manage its fiscal and monetary policies to stay on the high growth path.","India’s nominal gdp in 2015 was $2,103.6 billion.

China's Richest Reshuffle

About Zhang Yiming

TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd. 's founder Zhang Yiming has emerged as the wealthiest individual in China, marking his first ascent to this position. On Wednesday, Zhang claimed the top spot by overtaking Zhong Shanshan, known for his bottled water enterprise, and Tencent Holdings' co-founder Ma Huateng, with his wealth valued at $57.5 billion, according to a Bloomberg report.This achievement is particularly noteworthy for the 41-year-old, considering the recent challenges, including potential US restrictions on TikTok, ByteDance's popular application, and a temporary withdrawal of music content from the platform by the world's largest record label.Following a decline in Nongfu Spring Co.'s earnings that affected Zhong's wealth, Zhang secured the premier position. In the Asian wealth hierarchy, he now stands third, following Indian industrialists Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani, as per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index .Zhang's net worth increased by over $10 billion after Bloomberg's analysis of valuations from institutional investors BlackRock Inc., Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price Group Inc., alongside ByteDance's intention to repurchase employee shares at a $312 billion valuation. The four valuations averaged $365 billion.Also Read | Mukesh Ambani drops out of world’s top 10 richest persons list, retains Asia’s wealthiest person tag - check list The status of TikTok's operations in the United States remains uncertain. US President Donald Trump extended the deadline by 75 days - until April 5 - for ByteDance to secure a purchaser for its US operations or risk prohibition.According to Bloomberg News, Oracle Corp. is considering a proposal to acquire TikTok's US operations that would involve providing security guarantees and acquiring a minor stake in a new US entity, whilst potentially allowing the application's crucial algorithm to remain under Chinese control.On Wednesday, Trump indicated his willingness to consider reducing tariffs on China to obtain Beijing's backing for the sale of TikTok's US operations to an American organisation. He expressed confidence in securing at least a preliminary agreement for TikTok by the following week but stated that if a deal remained incomplete, he would pursue a deadline extension.ByteDance maintains a prominent position in China's artificial intelligence sector. Its AI chatbot Doubao serves 75 million regular active users, whilst the organisation reports that its earlier vision understanding model operates at costs 85% below the industry standard, similar to DeepSeek.Also Read | Elon Musk is world’s richest person on Hurun Rich List with $420 billion net worth - it’s the 'Trump Effect' at work? Zhang stands apart from traditional Chinese billionaires due to his innovative and globally-focused enterprise, according to Hao Gao, who serves as director at Tsinghua University's Research Centre for Global Family Business.Currently residing in Singapore, Zhang, a Chinese citizen, accumulated his fortune solely through his 21% ownership in ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, which boasts over 1 billion users worldwide.His professional journey began at Kuxun.com, a tourism search website, where he worked as an engineer. He ventured into entrepreneurship in 2009 by establishing 99fang.com, a property search platform, which he departed from after three years.In 2012, he established ByteDance from a modest flat in Beijing, introducing the Toutiao news application, which garnered over 13 million daily users within two years. His vision was to develop an AI-driven platform distinct from Baidu, China's dominant search engine.""The most important thing is that we are not a news business,"" Zhang said in a 2017 interview. ""We are more like a search business or a social media platform. We are doing very innovative work. We are not a copycat of a US company, both in product and technology.""ByteDance introduced TikTok (known as Douyin in China) in 2016, initially attracting a modest following. The application quickly gained popularity amongst younger generations and achieved global success in subsequent years. The company acquired Musical.ly, a Chinese social media platform, for approximately $800 million in 2018, subsequently incorporating it into TikTok. The organisation has since developed into a diverse conglomerate, offering various applications ranging from video content to entertainment platforms featuring humour and celebrity news.Zhang relinquished his position as chief executive in 2021, followed shortly by his resignation as chairman. Similarly, other prominent billionaires, including Jack Ma of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Colin Huang of PDD Holdings Inc., have also withdrawn from active management roles in their respective organisations.","Zhang yiming has emerged as the wealthiest individual in china, marking his first ascent to this position.
