'Paid Campaign': Nitin Gadkari Slams Criticism Of E20 Program; Calls It 'Politically Motivated'

New Delhi: Highway commuters won’t have to stop to pay user fee at national highway toll plazas by 2026-end as the govt rolls out the multi-lane free flow (MLFF) system, road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari said on Wednesday. He added that the FASTag annual pass launched in Aug, which allows private vehicles to cross 200 plazas, has also come as a big relief for people.Gadkari said over 40 lakh private car owners have subscribed to the FASTag annual pass. “People will be rid of stopping or slowing down at toll plazas as we roll out the MLFF toll system. Cameras above the road will read the number plate and user fee will be automatically debited from the vehicle FASTag account. All this will happen even when someone is driving at a speed of 80 kmph. I made this announcement in Rajya Sabha today,” he said.Earlier in the day, he said in RS that the new system will help save fuel worth Rs 1,500 crore and increase toll revenue by Rs 6,000 crore. The system will make toll collection transparent and corruption-free, he said.Gadkari also said that a system is being put in place where vehicle owners will have to clear all dues, including pending toll fee and e-challans when they sell their vehicles or renew registration.On the next major focus of highway development in the country, Gadkari said that now there is more thrust on building greenfield highways, which is key to reduce logistics cost. “In India, earlier the logistics cost was 16%. But the latest study by IIM-Bangalore, IIT-Kanpur and IIT-Madras indicates that our logistics cost on road has reduced by 6%. The report was out three-four months back. So, I am confident that by now this logistics cost is in single digit at 9%,” he said.He said govt’s focus on infrastructure is driving India’s economic growth. “For the growth of any country, infrastructure is important. Roads, water, power, transport and communication, without developing this infrastructure, we can’t get capital investment in industry and trade & business. And, without investment, we cannot create jobs... Without jobs, we cannot eradicate poverty,” he added.","Gadkari said over 40 lakh private car owners have subscribed to the fastag annual pass.

H-1B Showdown: Amazon, Google Microsoft Pour Billions Into India as 20 States Sue Trump

NEW DELHI: An H-1B visa holder expressed their frustration over a sudden visa rescheduling that moved their December interview to March 2026 and left them unable to return to the US.The user shared their experience in a post on the workplace forum Blind. He said the rescheduling appears linked to a new social media vetting policy. Officials are now reviewing applicants’ posts on platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn to check for content seen as negative toward the US.“So I am one of those unlucky souls who got hit by the mass rescheduling this week. I had my h1b interview scheduled for December and got an email saying its moved to March 2026. MARCH. That’s literally 3 months away,” the uservwrote.They said the lack of information from employers has made the situation worse. “The worst part is nobody knows what's happening. The immigration team at my company is clueless, HR is giving generic responses like ‘we understand your frustration’ which helps exactly zero percent,” they added.The visa holder said they are currently stuck in India after their I-94 expired and are on unpaid leave.They’ve been relying on personal savings while waiting for updates and said a request to work from his company’s India office had not been answered.The user also noted that starting January 1, visa applicants will be allowed only one free rescheduling. If they miss the March appointment or needs to change it again, a visa fee of about Rs 16,000 will have to be paid.“Thousands of us got hit at the same time. december was supposed to be peak season for h1b stamping and they just wiped out the entire month. people who took expensive flights, booked hotels, all of that just gone,” they wrote.They ended the post by asking if others were facing the same situation and whether they were trying to get emergency appointments or arranging to work from India.The disruptions follow a new US State Department rule announced on December 3 that requires social-media screening for all H-1B workers and their H-4 dependents starting December 15. The rule is slowing down interviews, especially at busy consulates in Hyderabad and Chennai, and has led to mass cancellations of appointments originally scheduled for mid-to-late December 2025. Many of these appointments have been pushed into next year, with some as far out as June 2026.The US Embassy in India has warned that arriving on an old appointment date could lead to denial of entry. Immigration lawyers are now advising H-1B holders in the US to avoid non-essential travel.Under the new directive, all H-1B and H-4 applicants must make their social media profiles public so consular officers can review their online activity. Experts say this represents one of the largest expansions of digital-footprint scrutiny in the visa process to date.","An h-1b visa holder expressed their frustration over a sudden visa rescheduling that moved their december interview to march 2026.

Delhi Pollution: China Shares Playbook On How To Fix Air Quality Amid Politics Over Accountability

NEW DELHI: The Supreme Court on Wednesday modified its earlier order restraining Delhi and NCR authorities from taking coercive action against ""end-of-life"" vehicles - 10-year-old diesel and 15-year-old petrol vehicles - and said the reprieve would apply only to BS 4 or BS 6 emission norm-compliant vehicles.This order will impact over 14.7 lakh BS 1 compliant cars, three-wheelers, two-wheelers, buses and goods carriers; more than 38.7 lakh BS 2 compliant ones; and another 53.7 lakh BS 3 vehicles. A bench of CJI Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi passed the order on an application by Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM).Need to restrict plying of vehicles on basis of BS standards: CAQMOn Aug 12, an SC bench led by then CJI B R Gavai had said, “We direct that no coercive steps be taken against owners of vehicles on the ground that these are 10 years old (in case of diesel) and 15 years old (in case of petrol).”Additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati said BS 1, BS 2 and BS 3 vehicles have completed 24 years, 20 years and 15 years, respectively, and are a major cause of air pollution in Delhi-NCR. The CAQM said a BS 1 diesel vehicle produces 5.4 times more CO (BS-2 two times more and BS-3 1.28 times more), 12.13 times more NOx (BS-2 8.75 times more and BS-3 6.25 times more) and 31.11 times more PM (BS-2 18 times and BS-3 2.3 times more) than a BS 4 compliant diesel vehicle.Agreeing to modify its Aug-12 order that had asked the authorities not to take coercive measures against end-of-life vehicles, the bench said only vehicles which are BS 4 and BS 6 compliant would not be proceeded against if they are older than 15 years.The CAQM, in its affidavit, said, “One of the criteria determining the fitness of a vehicle is its emissions. The emissions of any vehicle are tested against its BS standard category. Thus, an otherwise fit vehicle would still be emitting pollutants as per its BS standard. Since Delhi-NCR faces an extraordinary situation, especially during the winter season due to poor dispersal of pollutants on account of unfavourable meteorological conditions, there is a need to restrict the plying of polluting vehicles based on emission standards in Delhi-NCR. ”In compliance with orders of SC and National Green Tribunal, CAQM had issued a directive on July 8 mandating retail outlets to refuse fuel to all end-of-life vehicles with effect from Nov 1 this year in Delhi and from April 1, 2026, in five high-vehicle-density districts contiguous to Delhi, besides other actions in accordance with law.","The supreme court modified its earlier order restraining delhi and ncr authorities from taking coercive action against ""end-of-life"" vehicles. The reprieve would apply only to bs 4 or bs 6 emission norm-compliant vehicles.

Coal’s share in India’s electricity mix likely to fall from over 70% in 2025 to about 60% by 2030: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/coals-share-in-indias-electricity-mix-likely-to-fall-from-over-70-in-2025-to-about-60-by-2030-report/articleshow/126043648.cms,".

New Delhi: Coal’s share in India’s electricity mix is projected to fall from over 70% in 2025 to about 60% by 2030, even as the country’s overall coal demand is expected to rise 17% over the next five years, according to the International Energy Agency (IEA).IEA said India’s total coal consumption in 2025 is likely to record a marginal year-on-year decline of 1.2%, driven mainly by a 3% drop in coal-fired power generation. Higher hydropower output following an early and strong monsoon, lower electricity demand for cooling and the continued expansion of renewable energy capacity have contributed to the decline.In 2024, India’s coal production rose 7% to an all-time high of 1,082 million tonnes (MT). While most of the output was thermal coal, India also produced lignite and metallurgical coal. IEA said production growth outpaced demand growth by two percentage points, supporting India’s strategy of cutting coal imports, strengthening energy security, and avoiding supply shortages and price spikes.The report — Coal 2025: Analysis and Forecast to 2030 — said coal remains central to India’s electricity system, with coal use for power generation in 2025 estimated at around 940 MT, accounting for nearly 72% of total coal consumption of 1,297 MT.India’s total installed power generation capacity stood at 495 GW in Aug 2025, comprising 253 GW of coal-fired capacity, including 30 GW of captive plants, 123 GW of solar, 52 GW of wind, and 42 GW of hydropower, along with smaller contributions from gas, nuclear, and other sources.While the govt continues to expand non-fossil generation capacity in line with its 500 GW target for 2030, India commissioned or began trial operations at 20 new coal-fired power plants totalling 14 GW in 2025, with additional capacity under construction, the report said.Madhura Joshi, programme lead for global clean power diplomacy at E3G, said India has made remarkable progress on renewables, with 2025 expected to be a record-breaking year. She said the decline in coal demand alongside rapid renewable growth signals positive momentum for India’s energy transition. Sustaining this pace of renewable and storage expansion, she said, would help India meet its development, growth, energy security and climate goals.IEA noted that non-power coal demand has emerged as the main source of growth in 2025. Industrial coal use is being driven by strong infrastructure activity and steady expansion in the cement and steel sectors. India, the world’s second-largest cement market, is expected to see cement demand grow 5%–6% in 2025 and remain elevated over the medium term.Capacity expansion by major cement producers, rising steel output — particularly through coal-based direct reduced iron — and coal gasification projects are reinforcing coal’s role in India’s industrial growth, underscoring the continued importance of both thermal and metallurgical coal.India’s non-power coal consumption is projected to reach 356 MT in 2025 and rise further to 470 MT by 2030. Overall coal demand is expected to increase 17% by the end of the decade, reaching 1,522 MT, the report said.China, however, remains the dominant force in global coal markets, consuming about 30% more coal than the rest of the world combined.","India’s total coal consumption in 2025 is likely to record a marginal year-on-year decline of 1.2%.

Mamiko Tanaka's net worth in 2025 and what is known about her career earnings

Shohei Ohtani and Mamiko Tanaka's combined net worth in 2025

Shohei Ohtani remains one of the most discussed athletes in world sport, and in 2025, attention around him is not limited to baseball alone. His record contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers, combined with his global endorsement presence, has kept his finances in focus. Alongside him, Mamiko Tanaka has also drawn interest, particularly around how their individual careers translate into shared wealth.The couple has kept their personal life private since their marriage. There have been no public financial disclosures or interviews addressing money. Still, estimates based on career earnings provide a broad picture of where they stand in 2025.Shohei Ohtani’s net worth in 2025 is estimated at around $150 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. The figure is based on his baseball income and endorsement earnings rather than the full value of his Dodgers contract. In December 2023, Ohtani signed a 10-year, $700 million deal with the Dodgers, the largest contract in professional sports history.The contract is heavily deferred. Ohtani earns only $2 million in total salary over the 10 years, with the remaining amount scheduled to be paid out in annual installments from 2034 to 2043.Because of this structure, the contract does not immediately inflate his net worth.Ohtani’s primary income during this period comes from endorsements. He earns an estimated $40 to $50 million per year through sponsorships and brand deals, particularly in Japan and the United States. These deals make him one of the highest-earning athletes globally outside of salary.Mamiko Tanaka’s net worth is less clearly defined. In 2024, several estimates placed her net worth at around $70 million, based on her professional basketball career in Japan. She played at the top level before stepping away from the sport.For 2025, there is no confirmed update on Tanaka’s net worth. No official figures have been released, and available estimates vary. As a result, her current financial standing can only be discussed in approximate terms. What is established is that her wealth was built independently through her athletic career success.Based on available estimates, Shohei Ohtani and Mamiko Tanaka’s combined net worth in 2025 is placed at around $220 million or more. The exact total depends largely on how Tanaka’s current valuation is assessed, given the lack of updated public data.There has been no confirmation from either side regarding finances. The figures remain estimates based on known earnings, contracts, and career history.Also read: Shane Bieber’s Big Sky trip with wife Kara reveals a side fans rarely get to see","Shohei ohtani's net worth in 2025 is estimated at around $150 million, according to celebrity net worth.

Silent Hill Townfall leaked release date



Silent Hill Townfall storyline , protagonist, and gameplay



Silent Hill Townfall is an upcoming title in the Silent Hills series, and it was revealed back in 2022. The game is basically a collaboration between Konami, Annapurna Interactive, and the narrative studio Screen Burn (known for Stories Untold, Observation).A lot of time has passed since the initial reveal of the game via a cryptic teaser, and the project has now vanished from public view. However, a recent retail slip-up suggests that the game could arrive much sooner than anticipated, signaling a continued, aggressive resurgence for the entire Silent Hill franchise.The information about the release date of Silent Hill Townfall was originally leaked on a listing on E-Shop Liverpool Mexico, which is a regional retailer. They displayed a release date of March 26, 2026. The specificity of this date suggests it is unlikely to be a simple placeholder and implies that Konami might have finalized the launch window.The leak has managed to gain a lot of traction after being noted by prominent community figures. With the franchise having seen recent success with Silent Hill 2 Remake and Silent Hill f, momentum could be building for a major announcement.If the March 2026 date is accurate, Konami may be planning a new Silent Hill Transmission event soon, possibly following rumored franchise updates at an upcoming Xbox Partner Preview.However, all of this must be taken with a pinch of salt, given that nothing has been confirmed by Konami yet. As a result, you are advised to wait for official confirmation from the developers.Details regarding Silent Hill Townfall's story, protagonist, and gameplay are scarce. This aligns with the psychological tension the series is known for. The initial teaser hinted at hidden messages and deep-seated horror, a style that perfectly suits the developer.Given the studio's history of creating interactive narrative experiences, fans have been anticipating that Townfall will focus heavily on psychological horror. The game could also use a first-person perspective to immerse you in the creeping dread.The game is expected to be available on major current-generation platforms, including PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. It will mostly capitalize on the renewed interest in the horror universe. If the early 2026 launch window holds, Silent Hill Townfall is set to deliver another unique and terrifying experience just as the series hits peak popularity.This was all you needed to know about Silent Hill Townfall.","A retail slip-up suggests that the game could arrive much sooner than anticipated.

Buddy Matthews’ AEW contract, experience and income streams

Endorsements, branding and lifestyle choices

Rhea Ripley quietly forms one of pro wrestling's most lucrative pairings with Buddy Matthews. They are seasoned mainstay in-ring performers at the pinnacle of the industry, Matthews being a focal performer in AEW, and Ripley establishing herself as a lynchpin of WWE programming.Neither promotion releases contract details, but industry estimates and reported earnings paint a clear picture of their place in 2025. Together, Ripley and Matthews are estimated to be worth somewhere in the $6 million to $8 million range combined, making them one of the richest couples on the AEW roster (or WWE roster) when it comes to salary, with earnings supplemented by bonuses, endorsements, and security offered by longer-term contracts.Rhea Ripley’s rise in WWE has paralleled her financial success. Since moving to the main roster from NXT, she has been one of the most recognizable women in the company, often in title programs and in premium live events. Her base salary is said to be mid-six figures, but the number is greatly inflated by performance bonuses, merchandise royalties, and major-show appearances.A long-term contract extension that WWE signed Ripley to in order to keep her with the company for several more years highlighted her value to the promotion.The deal demonstrates her in-ring reliability as well as her crossover appeal, and is another example of WWE's need for the kind of stars who can act as brand ambassadors on various platforms. This means Ripley herself is personally worth between $1 million and $3 million, with room for upside as her role grows.Buddy Matthews came to AEW as one of the smartest in-ring wrestlers of his generation. His AEW deal is described in wrestling circles as hitting the sweet spot financially, where he is being compensated based on both his extensive experience and his status as a regular TV-featured talent. And while his exact salary is not publicly known, Matthews has spent a lot more time in major promotions compared to most of his contemporaries, and that adds up to a considerably higher overall net worth.Mathews has a wrestling contract but also has income incentives in merchandise sales, independent appearances, and digital side-hustles like gaming and streaming. These additional revenue streams go a long way to explain his estimated net worth of $5 million in 2025.Ripley is marketable, well beyond the ring. Her image has become a commercial asset as she has partnered with fitness, gaming, and collectible brands. While he has thrust his profile higher than it ever has been, Matthews has stayed a little more grounded and continues to monetize his platform through brand work and community-driven platforms.Also Read: WWE Hall of Famer Kevin Nash calls Rhea Ripley ‘bigger than life’, compares her to Hulk Hogan","Rhea ripley and buddy matthews are estimated to be worth $6 million to $8 million combined.

Delhi Pollution: China Shares Playbook On How To Fix Air Quality Amid Politics Over Accountability

NEW DELHI: How did Beijing go from being the ‘smog capital of the world' to footnotes in research papers on tackling air pollution? China has lessons for India.In a series of posts on X, spokesperson of the Chinese embassy in India, Yu Jing laid out the path that Beijing followed to drastically improve air quality.""Both China and India know the struggle with air pollution amid rapid urbanization. While the challenge remains complex, China's sustained efforts over the past decade have delivered noticeable improvements..."" Jing posted.Beijing's annual PM 2.5 average in 2013 was 101.7 ug/m3. In 2024, it stood at 30.9 ug/m3.In her posts that followed, Jing spoke about the steps taken in transport and industry sectors that led to better air.""How did Beijing tackle air pollution? Step 1: Vehicle emissions control. Adopt ultra-strict regulations like China 6NI (on par with Euro 6). Phase-out retired old, high-emission vehicles. Curb car growth via license-plate lotteries and odd-even / weekday driving rules. Build one of the world's largest metro and bus networks. Accelerate the shift to electric mobility. Work with the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region on coordinated emissions cuts.Cleaner air doesn't happen overnight—but it is achievable,"" she said.Addressing air pollution from industry, Jing said, ""Step 2: Industrial Restructuring. Shut down or remove 3000+ heavy industries. Relocating Shougang, one of China's largest steelmakers, alone cut inhalable particles by 20%. Transform vacated factories into parks, commercial zones, cultural and tech hubs. Example, the former Shougang site became the 2022 Winter Olympics venue. Relieve non-capital functions by relocating wholesale markets, logistics hubs and some educational and medical institutions. Coordinate regional integration by shifting general manufacturing to Hebei, while retaining high-value R&D and services in Beijing.""These interventions are not unheard of in India. Cleaner fuel for vehicles as well as industry, a curb on growth of private vehicles and robust public transport have been part of discussions for at least a decade.According to experts, the difference is in the scale and seriousness of the action.""In China, action was not taken just in Beijing but in 26 cities and towns to tackle the problem, which is regional. The first lesson is that the actions they took were urgent, stringent, and at a large scale. They took deep to enable massive energy transition, like getting rid of coal not only in industry but also in household use. Beijing also capped the number of cars that can be sold in a year even as it created infrastructure for public transport. We will find similarities in our plans for Delhi-NCR but the scale is missing,"" said Anumita Roy Chaudhuri, Executive Director, Research and Advocacy, Centre For Science and Environment.She also said action in Delhi is taken only during air emergencies.""We can't have just emergency measures. The implementation of these actions has to be round-the clock,"" she said.Sunil Dahiya, Founder and Lead Analyst at the think tank EnviroCatalyst, said, ""We already have BS6, which is equivalent to Euro 6, and the latest decision on not allowing BS VI or below vehicles in Delhi seems to be in the right direction. All the steps suggested for vehicular pollution were tried in India, but they didn't work only because there wasn't a political will.""On industrial pollution, Dahiya said shifting or removing all industries to a different region might be difficult as we are dealing with the livelihood of people residing in several states. ""We can instead come up with better facilities. For instance, small and medium enterprises or manufacturing units mostly use undesignated fuel and lack air pollution control devices. We can introduce better mechanisms with common pollution control devices, emission control devices, and restructuring industrial clusters,"" he said, adding that since 2019, no strict measures have been taken against power plants.","Beijing's annual pm 2.5 average in 2013 was 101.7 ug/m3.

You can't help but be intrigued when a skater known for his astonishing quickness owns the most luxurious cars in the world. The behind-the-wheel world of McDavid has become almost as exciting as that of the ice, and the constant whispers, snapshots, and news stories are all part of a garage scenario that is perfectly built for both thrill and precision lovers.He is fond of speedy, sharp design and machines that attract everybody's attention without even trying. Just think of it—impressive engines, elegantly shaped bodies, and brands that are synonymous with power. That’s the whole atmosphere around McDavid’s car collection—part enigma, part show, and completely high-performance. Although the atmosphere of each vehicle is different, together they tell the tale of a sportsman who has passions for engineering as much as for hockey. The collection mirrors McDavid's love for speed, precision, power, and engineering.Connor McDavid's collection can be characterized by the harmony of diversity and spiritedness.The pure drama of his Lamborghini Huracán—chouette, loud, and ready to totally erase the road—adds personality to his garage. The Audi R8, with its V10 elegance and grace, may be cold but still very precise, could be wrangling. For a choice of luxury SUVs, he prefers the Range Rover Vogue, which can offer him maximum class and comfort combined with very light capability.The Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 is McDavid's car that radiates sounds; however, it's the American muscle car that provides supercharged vigor and finely-tuned road presence. Then there is the Ford F-150 Raptor, the beast that proves McDavid is not afraid of getting dirty off the road. The Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG, on the other hand, is the one that adds drama to the collection; its characteristic gullwing doors and powerful V8 engine are visually striking and lend the impression of being almost a character in the collection.Out of all the cars in his collection, the Porsche 911 GT2 RS is undoubtedly Connor McDavid’s favorite, according to several sources—the absolute choice for those who want nothing but the best in performance. Thanks to its track-oriented design, it has extremely precise control, and it produces massive power—basically a machine for sportspeople who love speed not only as a mere idea but as a way of life. For McDavid, the GT2 RS is not just a car—it’s part of the force he applies on the ice.Connor McDavid’s car collection is an exhibition of his/ flamboyance and substance—an automotive representation of his personality. The collection is made up of various cars that all demonstrate different facets of his style, resulting in a fleet that narrates its own high-speed tale of victory, love, and accuracy. Each vehicle echoes the same excellence he consistently delivers on ice.Also Read: Why was Max Domi left out vs. the Washington Capitals, and will he get another chance this weekend?","Connor mcdavid's car collection mirrors his love for speed, precision, power, and engineering.

Frogan declines the Financial Audit invite and explains her reasons publicly





YouTuber Caleb Hammer and Twitch streamer Morgan “Frogan” were involved in a heated exchange online recently, which quickly turned into a huge talking point among viewers. What began as a charity-related offer/invite to Frogan to appear on Hammer’s Financial Audit turned sour. Frogan was not receptive to the invitation, and the situation got even worse.Through X, they took jabs at each other, with Frogan declaring how Hammer would degrade just for content and clicks. The exchange drew strong reactions from fans across YouTube, Twitch, and TikTok. Hammer ultimately replied back to Frorgan’s claims and expressed how he had no intention of shaming her online by inviting her on his show.The whole situation began when Caleb Hammer offered to match a $10,000 charity donation if Frogan appeared on his popular Financial Audit show. A fan circulated a clip from his livestream about the invitation, in which Hammer again publicly extended the offer by commenting on it. The YouTuber was respectful in his request to Frogan and seemed to offer a helping hand.He wrote, “Frogan, $20,000 currently to come on Financial Audit. Legit, my team and I will respect what you wish to talk about and not talk about. I want to set you up for Financial Success. Let's do this thing.""However, Frogan declined the invitation the following day, saying she believed the appearance would be harmful to her and her reputation.In her response on X, Frogan pushed back against the idea that she was asking viewers for money and accused the critics of watching her content in bad faith. She wrote, “I don’t need a YouTube financial advisor to try to degrade me for content since that’s what’s popular."" She also addressed speculation around her income, explaining that she no longer earns ad revenue on Twitch after a past ban.According to Frogan, that loss forced her to rely more heavily on subscriptions, which she described as unpredictable. She added that she is actively working to build income outside of Twitch, including behind-the-scenes production work for other creators. Frogan made it clear that she felt her financial situation was not a fit for Hammer’s show.She finally wrote, “So no - I will not be coming onto your show. I have seen your content, and it doesn’t align with what I’m experiencing."" Hammer later responded, saying he never intended to shame her and was open to respecting her boundaries. He expressed disappointment that the conversation could not happen but wished her well. This newest exchange comes just weeks after Hammer drew harsh criticism for publicly claiming that another creator, iDubbbz, was broke.Also read: Ethen Klein claps back at Frogan’s Twitch complaints about streaming and mods","Morgan ""frogan"" frorgan and youtuber caleb hammer were involved in a heated exchange online.

Paul Heyman’s estimated net worth in 2025 and income sources

Marla Heyman’s financial profile and the combined net worth question

Paul Heyman has been one of wrestling's most influential people, shaping eras in ECW and WWE. With his consistent presence both on-screen and behind the scenes on WWE programming, interest in his finances has been rekindled in 2025, raising questions regarding his own wealth and whether or not he even has a combined net worth with his previous wife, Marla Heyman.While entertainment finance outlets regularly estimate Paul Heyman’s earnings, his wife, Marla Heyman, has been able to keep her life quite private, and there are no financial records available to review. Therefore, any conversation about a joint net worth is based on confirmed reporting for Paul Heyman, and the lack of available information is not representative of Marla.According to entertainment finance trackers like Celebrity Net Worth, Paul Heyman's net worth is around $10 million. While not officially verified by WWE or Heyman himself, these numbers are frequently referenced in wrestling media circles.That fortune he has accumulated is largely down to his deep ties to WWE. Wrestling observers associated outlets have covered the subject of Heyman's WWE salary, which was recently reported to be as high as about $2 million per year based on both his onscreen character as well as his offscreen creative prowess.His association with The Bloodline storyline over the past few years has increased this company's cash cow status.Part of Heyman's legacy includes his earlier years with Extreme Championship Wrestling, but not in a good way. Quotes about ECW from court records and wrestling business historians have reported that ECW had declared bankruptcy in the early 00s while also holding a large sum of debt. Though WWE would subsequently purchase ECW's video library and intellectual property and later reinstate the brand's historical significance, this did not equate to a massive paycheck for Heyman personally at the time.Marla Heyman is still not prominent in public financial disclosures. Biographical databases and celebrity background websites have never made clear what her career entailed and what her sources of income were, so assigning an accurate net worth is not possible.Therefore, any assertions of Paul and Marla Heyman's net worth in 2025 should be taken with a grain of salt. Given the reporting available, the only reasonable conclusion is that Paul Heyman has an independently estimated net worth of around $10 million in addition to whatever Marla Heyman has.Also Read: Paul Heyman reveals his new WWE nickname","According to entertainment finance trackers like celebrity net worth, paul heyman's net worth is around $10 million.

Braun Strowman’s WWE earnings and career-driven wealth

Victoria González (Raquel Rodriguez) and a rising financial trajectory

In 2025, Braun Strowman and Victoria González (aka Raquel Rodriguez) are at very different levels on the money ladder inside WWE. Together, they make for a great case study for how the WWE career of today can lead to multi-generational wealth. One is a heavyweight constructed to be a headline-grabbing mixed martial artist with previous experience as a world-title challenger, the other a recognized talent of the women’s division, with still-increasing value with the exposure of television.It is never a science to estimate a wrestler's net worth. WWE contracts are private, and income streams vary year-to-year. However, based on well-circulated numbers and career context, Strowman certainly represents the bigger portion of that percentage. While, on the other hand, Gonzalez's financial profile continues to reflect upward momentum instead of a maximum paycheck.Due to this fact, his estimated net worth in 2025 is between $2 million and $5 million. Most of that wealth is built on his years as a major headliner, where guaranteed deals, bonus money from premium live events, and royalty checks for merchandise comprise the foundation of earnings.Strowman was said to have signed a seven-figure a year deal before his release, which illustrates how quickly WWE's upper crust can line their pockets without ever setting foot in Hollywood or becoming major crossover draws.His status as a physical marvel meant he could stay commercially relevant across multiple creative cycles, and that is the biggest one of financial sustainability for WWE stars.It may not come with a lot of glitz in the public arena, Strowman's lifestyle veers toward upper-crust travel, fitness investments, and niche performance automotive (rather than celebrity branding bluster) outside the ring, but the money is there to be spent. His earnings are also buoyed by sporadic WWE-related media projects and appearances, as he is a company asset and not a star in it for the short term.Victoria Gonzalez, on the higher end of the scale for new main-roster talents, has an estimated net worth cited in 2025 to sit around $700,000. Her income consists of a base annual salary, plus earnings from live events, plus earnings from merchandise sales, plus championship bonuses from NXT and the women’s tag subdivision.Gonzalez makes money in one way that Strowman did not, because it is a story of momentum. Her notch up the card from NXT Women’s Champion and various Women’s Tag Team Champion opportunities has been slowly improving her stock to where the next time her deal is up for renewal, she could command a bit more in a monthly paycheck. She is also sidelined by health-related absences while on that ascent, but that is not the end of her long-term organisational worth.Also Read: Braun Strowman shares cryptic post on X hinting at career-ending after shocking WWE release","Braun strowman and victoria gonzález make for a great case study for how the wwe career of today can lead to multi-generational wealth.

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon musk has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

Leon Draisaitl, the German NHL star and one of the league’s highest-paid players, has silently created a lifestyle that depicts both financial might and personal seclusion.

For ease, he takes the Edmonton home during the NHL season, but the exact information about his Canadian residence is undisclosed. A mansion is Draisaitl’s primary luxury property, and it is located in Cologne, where the price is said to be around $10 million. The estate is more than 10,000 square feet, and it has high ceilings, spa-style bathrooms, a gourmet kitchen, modern interiors, and a vast outdoor area designed for privacy.There is nothing flashy about his living, but it is undoubtedly luxurious.

Fame, safety concerns, and a lifestyle Nichols no longer wanted





Former YouTuber Luke Nichols, who was behind the highly successful Outdoor Boys channel, recently revealed his reason behind stepping back from YouTube and content creation. For many years, Nichols built a loyal following by documenting his outdoor adventures, survival skills, and familial moments that felt authentic and relatable. His channel’s rapid growth turned him into one of YouTube’s most recognizable outdoor creators.In an interview on Steven’s MyLifeOutdoors channel, Nichols spoke candidly about how he did not see himself growing old as a YouTuber and had been thinking of retirement for some years. He emphasized that other concerns, including long-term sustainability, personal safety, and family priorities, shaped his outlook.During his appearance on MyLifeOutdoors, Nichols explained his long-term plans and how being a YouTuber was not feasible anymore. While also reflecting on the nature of online fame, he said, ""I always knew that I wasn't going to do this forever. And I've been thinking of retiring for a couple of years, actually. You know? I've been talking.""Nichols further went back in time to when he achieved peak fame and how people were recognizing him everywhere.Instead of embracing all the attention, he grew concerned about himself and his family. The former YouTuber added, ""A big part of it was the exposure. The channel blew up really big, and it kind of went from, 'Oh, people recognize me every once in a while…we started to have really serious conversations about security issues and the safety of the family.For Nichols, the idea of becoming a full-time celebrity did not attract him in the first place. He expressed his desire to live a normal life with his family and have the freedom to go wherever he wanted without any disruptions of any kind. He stated, “I'm looking at, you know, 'Okay, I'm going to be, you know, a really full-blown celebrity lifestyle.' I'm like, 'I don't want that. I don't want it for the kids. I don't want to live that way. ”Alongside fame, Nichols further pointed to another issue many creators face, which is the need to work at a relentless pace. He asserted that working 80 to 100 hours a week had taken a toll on his health and balance.

The state of AI adoption





American billionaire and entrepreneur Mark Cuban has now urged the young engineers entering the job market to prioritise small and medium-sized companies over multinational corporations (MNCs) when seeking opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI). Cuban feels that smaller companies offer better platform for new graduates to make an immediate impact, while large corporations often dilute individual contributions.Speaking in an interview with CNBC and on his podcast The Dumbest Guy in the Room, Cuban explained that smaller companies are mainly entrepreneur-driven and they lack the deep IT departments or larger corporations. This gap creates opportunities for fresh graduates which directly contribute to the AI projects.“Small- to medium-size companies don’t have that depth. They are typically entrepreneurially driven and don’t have the flexibility to have people research things. Bringing a new graduate on to work on agentic AI projects is inexpensive for them and can get them immediate results,” Cuban said.Cuban also used the example of his own company, Cost Plus Drugs, noting how AI can automate processes to boost productivity, competitiveness, and profitability.Cuban argued that in big organisations, AI skills may not stand out as they are common among thousands of IT employees. On the other hand, in smaller firms often lack such expertise, making new graduates with AI knowledge invaluable. He also compared the present wave of AI with early days of the internet, when young engineers were hired to implement new technologies because they were more comfortable with them than older executives.Cuban also highlighted that 95% of companies have not yet seen measurable revenue returns from AI investments. The exceptions, he said, are mostly early-stage startups led by young entrepreneurs who design their processes around AI models tailored to their businesses.He urged his children and other young people to learn as much as possible about AI, stressing that companies are still grappling with how to use the technology for competitive advantage.",Mark cuban has urged young engineers to prioritise small and medium-sized companies over multinational corporations (mncs) when seeking opportunities in artificial intelligence.
