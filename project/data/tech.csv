India needs $22tn for net zero by 2070; coal use to rise till 2047: Niti Aayog,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-needs-22tn-for-net-zero-by-2070-coal-use-to-rise-till-2047-niti-aayog/articleshow/128139161.cms,"NEW DELHI: At a time when India is working on its 2035 climate action targets, the govt’s think tank, Niti Aayog, on Monday released a roadmap to achieve the country’s ‘net zero’ emission goal by 2070, noting that the transition will need cumulative investment requirements of $22.7 trillion, around $500 billion annually, to finance several “high-level actions” to meet the twin objectives of ‘Viksit Bharat’ (developed India) and long-term carbon neutrality. It said at least $6 trillion out of the total investment requirement needs to come from external sources.The govt think tank also underlined that India’s coal consumption will continue to rise till 2047, giving enough hint of what India’s updated climate action - Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC) - for 2035 would look like.The roadmap - Scenarios Towards ‘Viksit Bharat’ and Net Zero: An Overview - emphasised India’s vision of becoming a developed economy by 2047 and achieving ‘net zero’ emissions by 2070, saying it will require a “delicate balancing act”.“Many of the technologies needed for net zero have yet to reach commercial maturity, while mature low-carbon technologies often demand large up-front investments,” the report said, referring to challenges.Noting a scenario of transition to clean energy in India, the report flagged that the non-fossil fuel power generation (including captive) share is expected to increase from 23% in 2025 to 65% in the current policy scenario and 80% in the ‘net zero’ scenario by 2050.“It is further expected to rise above 80% by 2070 in the current policy scenario, and to 100% in the ‘net zero’ scenario, it said.“The ‘net zero’ strategy is simple – first, electrify energy use. Two, green and clean electricity. Three, control demand through Mission LiFE. Four, focus on circularity and efficiency. Last, cheaper external finance is needed. Clearly stated, India’s coal consumption will go up till 2047 even as energy intensity decreases and efficiency goes up, while meeting ‘net zero’ goals. India can leapfrog to be a global leader in clean technologies. 85% of India of 2047 is yet to be built and can be built to be climate-friendly,” said B.V.R Subrahmanyam, CEO, NITI Aayog, on the occasion of the release of the report.Besides focus on clean energy, the roadmap’s high-level actions for India’s ‘net zero’ transition include focus on circularity, urban mobility, efficient buildings, proper land use, critical minerals, and robust data for monitoring, reporting & verification (MRV) systems as core infrastructure.On financing the transition, it noted that the power sector alone accounts for over half of total needs ($22.7 trillion), reflecting its central role in enabling economy-wide electrification and the expansion of low-carbon generation.“On an annualised basis, this cumulative requirement translates into average flows of approximately $500 billion per year, compared with actual annual investment of around $135 billion in 2024, of which only $70–80 billion currently supports clean energy,” the report said.Of this total, approximately $8 trillion must be front-loaded by 2050, including nearly $5 trillion in the power sector, given the capital-intensive nature of most low-carbon technologies, it added.The think tank noted that the financing gap of $6.5 trillion remains, as an estimated aggregate flow of only $16.2 trillion is expected against the ‘net zero’ scenario investment requirement of $22.7 trillion, and suggested having a ""National Green Finance Institution"" in the country to take care of the needs.It, at the same time, expressed confidence in India’s approach, saying India’s 'net zero' transition will create a new ‘Indian Development Model’ combining economic vitality, technological leadership, and sustainability. “The pathways India shows will be a lighthouse for the developing world. The Indian Development Model will set the trend for others,” said the think tank.“NITI Aayog has undertaken a comprehensive and rigorous exercise that will serve as a benchmark – a starting point for future discussions on ‘Viksit Bharat’ and ‘net zero’. The reports are a great resource for policymakers and researchers on charting India’s course to these twin objectives,” said V Anantha Nageswaran, Chief Economic Advisor to the government.The report has come out with 11 reports that detail the findings of India’s first government-led, multi-sectoral, integrated study to assess development scenarios that deliver on the Viksit Bharat 2047 while simultaneously reducing net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions to zero by 2070.The study entails a “scenario-based analytic modelling exercise” that integrates economic growth, India’s development priorities, and climate commitments. It has been prepared by 10 inter-ministerial working groups that examined long-term transition scenarios across key domains like macroeconomic aspects of the transition, sectoral low-carbon transition in power, transport, industry, buildings, and agriculture; financing for climate action; critical minerals; R&D and manufacturing; and the social implications of the transition.","Niti aayog released a roadmap to achieve the country’s ‘net zero’ emission goal by 2070.

What are air taxis and how will they work in India? CII report explains,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/what-are-air-taxis-and-how-will-they-work-in-india-cii-report-explains/articleshow/128137114.cms,"NEW DELHI: A pilot air taxi corridor linking Gurugram, Connaught Place and Jewar International Airport could sharply reduce travel time in the National Capital Region, according to a new report by the Confederation of Indian Industry. The study says Advanced Air Mobility solutions, including Electric Vertical Take Off and Landing aircraft, could help India ease infrastructure bottlenecks by shifting a share of urban travel to low-altitude airspace.The report proposes that air taxis initially operate from rooftops of hospitals and commercial buildings and be deployed for time-sensitive missions such as medical logistics and organ transport. Strategic co-location with hospitals, metro stations and business districts would allow integration with existing transport networks, it said.Citing severe pressure on surface transport, the report argues that Advanced Air Mobility is the logical next step for Indian cities. It suggests setting up a new regulatory body within the Directorate General of Civil Aviation to oversee the rollout of these services.Released by Civil Aviation Minister Rammohan Naidu Kinjarapu, the report outlines a phased plan to safely integrate next-generation air mobility into the aviation ecosystem and address urban congestion.Senior officials including DGCA chief Faiz Ahmed Kidwai and Airports Authority of India chairman Vipin Kumar were present at the launch, along with industry leaders.On infrastructure, the report makes a strong case for rooftop vertiports in major metros. “As India prepares Advanced Air Mobility, rooftop vertiports offer an efficient, scalable, and cost-effective solution, especially in cities like Delhi, Mumbai, and Bengaluru,” it said. With land acquisition for ground-based vertiports proving expensive and slow, rooftops of commercial hubs, hospitals, tech parks and residential towers are seen as a practical alternative using under-utilised real estate.However, regulatory hurdles remain. “Under the current DGCA regulations, routine commercial vertical take-offs and landings from rooftops are not yet permitted, and any future enablement would be subject to the evolution of applicable regulatory frameworks and safety assessments,” the report noted. It proposes a sequenced rollout starting with drone deliveries, followed by medical logistics and organ transport, and later air ambulance services.On funding, the report calls on public financial institutions, including SIDBI, banks and government grant agencies, to create dedicated financing instruments for Advanced Air Mobility. These could include sector-specific infrastructure funds, venture leasing models or credit enhancement facilities to lower investment risk and support long-term capital flows.","A pilot air taxi corridor linking gurugram, connaught place and jewar international airport could sharply reduce travel time in the national capital region.

'Tried to aggressively push our farm interests in US trade deal': Piyush Goyal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tried-to-aggressively-push-our-farm-interests-in-us-trade-deal-piyush-goyal/articleshow/128086504.cms,"Piyush Goyal (PTI photo)

'Dairy, Agriculture Protected': Piyush Goyal Outlines 'Historic' US-India Trade Deal, Lauds PM Modi

‘Farmers understand their interests & sensitivities have been protected’

Commerce & industry minister

Piyush Goyal

always has his calendar full with meetings, and the last few weeks have been particularly hectic due to the trade deals with the EU and the US. The minister discussed the details of the US deal with

TOI’s

Sidhartha

while insisting that the agreement will help Indian exporters grow and boost two-way trade. Excerpts:

Is there a sense of relief or a sense of accomplishment?

You, your team and others in govt have been working on this for close to a year now. There were ups and downs. What was the turning point?

Modi govt has been known to be very forthright and blunt. The negotiations saw Peter Navarro, commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, treasury secretary Scott Bessent making very aggressive remarks. There was no response from India. Was it deliberate silence?

So, the two sides were making progress even when there were headlines about things sliding towards a point of no return?

You have earlier said each trade deal stands on its own legs. But sheer timing, within eight days, EU and US deals were finalised. Was the EU deal an elephant in the room as far as the Americans are concerned?

Farmers’ bodies have called for a nationwide protest on Feb 12. Do you see that as a risk to the deal?

You have agreed to review non-tariff barriers on US farm products. Second, DDGS is going to be imported. Will it be at the expense of soybean farmers because it is cheaper?

India’s purchase of Russian oil was one of the things that held up the deal. The US executive order talks abouts India stopping Russian oil purchases, but govt has remained silent on it. Can you throw some light on that?

You have lobbed the ball into MEA’s court on Russian oil. How are you going to protect energy security? In your statement in Parliament you spoke about it.

There is also mention of removing import licensing for ICT products in the joint statement. What exactly is it and, two, are we looking at a more resilient supply chain through this?

Is this review also meant to rebalance trade, some of it is coming from countries which are not seen to be very friendly?

This is the first tranche of the trade deal. What is the road ahead? Will services be part of future talks?

There is an explicit reference to the modifications in commitments in case of changes to the agreed tariff by any of the countries. Does it have to do with Trump’s unpredictable nature?

Do you see the deal lifting the cloud of uncertainty over investments which may have been on hold?

Along with the joint statement, USTR issued a map which showed PoK and Aksai Chin as part of India. Is it just a coincidence?

NEW DELHI: Commerce & industry minister Piyush Goyal said Sunday that the govt has aggressively sought to push the farm sector's interests in the US trade deal, while protecting its sensitivities around dairy and agriculture.""We have $30-odd billion of imports. The important thing is we have $55 billion of exports of farm and fish produce. So, we should have an offensive interest, which is what we have focused on simultaneously along with protecting the sensitive sectors,"" he told TOI in an interview.The deal opens the doors for several products such as tea, coffee, spices and fruits with the US allowing their import at zero reciprocal tariff, while also helping seafood exporters compete favourably as the reciprocal tariff has been slashed to 18%.The minister also said that concern over the import of distillers dried grains with solubles, a feed ingredient that is a by-product of dry-milled ethanol production, is misplaced and that India has only opened a small window. While Goyal refused to disclose details, officials said against domestic animal feed consumption of 500 lakh tonnes, the quota offered to the US is only five lakh tonnes.The minister said the demand had come from the industry itself amid rising livestock population and growing requirement for feed, especially at a time when arable land is shrinking.This was long under negotiation, though not very long by FTA standards. It is very satisfying that the world’s largest democracies are coming closer together, further strengthening the most powerful relationship in the world. The US is already a $30 trillion economy and continues to grow, India, even though $4 trillion today, there is a clear roadmap given by the PM towards Viksit Bharat by 2047, we will grow to a $30-35 trillion economy, which means the delta of opportunity is huge. To be able to grab that opportunity we need to have better markets, open new vistas, attract investments, attract technologies to India. Completing EU and US trade deals in a span of eight days is quite satisfying, in a way reflective of India’s emergence as a confident nation.Trade negotiations are about crystal gazing into the future. Both sides look for the best deal, the important thing is to get the right balance, which is a win-win for both sides. As it gets closer towards completion, creating that right balance is always difficult. You are looking at protecting your sensitivities, the other side is looking at protecting their sensitivities. You are looking at your ability to gain from the agreement as is the other side. The process was a labour of love over the last 10 months. It ended on a very happy note with PM Narendra Modi and President Trump in their call last Monday deciding on closing negotiations with a rate for India, which is the best given to any of our competitors.I don’t think we were stuck on any position. I don’t think there was any acrimony on both sides throughout the negotiations. Everybody has a certain style and it’s important to appreciate that style. So, I don’t think India ever got into any misunderstandings on the trade front. Through the negotiations we kept a very good atmosphere.If you don’t misunderstand me, don’t believe the headlines. It is not for the newspapers alone, it’s for all of us. Very often we oversell our own thinking or over buy our own understanding or philosophy. One must always have the ability to listen to another new viewpoint and keep patience, particularly in trade negotiations as they are a long-drawn affair. You can’t rush things. That’s why I’ve often said never have a deadline for trade negotiations, you’ll make mistakes.It’s just that both happened within a short span of time. We are currently engaged in nearly 12-13 negotiations across the world and concluding them quite rapidly. We’ve concluded the UK, New Zealand, Oman, EU and US. There’s another one on the anvil. It reflects India’s growing confidence, growing understanding of international trade and the power of international trade. Our desire to become a developed nation by 2047 cannot be achieved unless we really look at much larger markets across the world.I don’t think so because farmer bodies also understand that we have kept the sensitivities in agriculture fully protected and excluded areas of high production in India, where we are generally self-sufficient: meat, poultry, rice, wheat, sugar, all dairy items, all GM products, soybean and corn. There’s hardly any item where any farmer can feel threatened. We have seen the import statistics. Right from Congress times, we have been importing soybean oil, tree nuts. We have heard this complaint that we have closed our doors to wines and spirits for no reason.A number of fresh and processed fruits continue to be imported. They are not available in India in sufficient measure. India imports 5.5 lakh tonnes of apples and there are certain items which India needs. We have $30-odd billion of imports. The important thing is we have $55 billion of exports of farm and fish produce. So, we should have an offensive interest, which is what we have focused on simultaneously along with protecting the sensitive sectors. American market has been opened for a large number of products for our farmers at zero reciprocal tariff, be it tea, coffee or spices, bananas, coconut, mangoes, kiwi and papaya. Trade is all about competition, comparative advantage. Now, we have the best comparative advantage. It’s for our businesses, our exporters to get the best and make the best of this wonderful deal.The concern about non-tariff barriers is totally misplaced because neither India nor US has non-tariff barriers. If there is any inadvertent or any difficulty to trade on both sides, we have agreed that we should try and smoothen the edges and speed up the benefits of this wonderful agreement. I see no reason why we should not resolve non-tariff barriers. We’ve done that in every agreement. The US has some of the best standards. India is now emerging as a high-quality producer of goods and provider of services. So, we have nothing to fear. As regards DDGS, we have a huge requirement, and it is growing. What we have agreed to is a very small quota. The animal husbandry department and industry desperately wants more DDGS because it’s a very high-quality protein. We have 194 million cattle, 112 million buffaloes and 878 million total livestock. As a govt, I have to balance all interests. But I can assure you we have protected soybeans. We are already importing $5 billion of soybean oil every year. If something was opened by UPA, let’s say for Indonesia or Japan or South Korea or Vietnam, I would rather have more competition as it gets me better price and better quality.Commerce ministry does not deal with this subject. I’m not aware of the details, another ministry deals with this.I did, but based on inputs that MEA gave me.n India needs huge quantities of ICT products for its growth and for engaging with modern technology. In the budget we announced huge concessions for data centres. But if we don’t get Nvidia chips or we don’t get AI equipment or quantum computing equipment or if we are dependent only on other geographies, we are harming our country. This was an offensive interest.India will look to get the best from around the world and at the best prices. In all of that we want to have trusted partners. Our focus is to encourage trade with trusted partners.We will first convert this into a proper agreement and legally binding agreement and thereafter we will continue to see other areas to expand trade and mutual cooperation.No. It is a general clause to make sure that the equitable agreement that we have reached continues to remain equitable.I certainly see this as a big boost for investments given that investors like predictability and stability and they love to see a strong relationship on the trade front. They can now plan investments with the confidence that import duty on their inputs are all very clear.Again, this is not my subject.","'dairy, agriculture protected': piyush goyal outlines 'historic' us-india trade deal, lauds pm modi.

PSLV-C62 Mishap: Failure analysis committee to be formed soon,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/pslv-c62-mishap-failure-analysis-committee-to-be-formed-soon/articleshow/128129547.cms,"Third Stage Trouble Strikes Again: Inside ISRO’s PSLV-C62 Deviation And What The Failure Means Ahead

BENGALURU: Isro, which has been analysing the data from the failed PSLV-C62 from Jan 12, is expected to formally constitute a Failure Analysis Committee (FAC) to investigate the causes for the mishap and recommend corrective measures soon.It has been nearly a month since the failure, the second for PSLV in as many attempts, and so far, the analysis has been done by an expert committee that is being called “data analysis committee” or DAC internally, multiple sources confirmed to TOI.Isro chairman V Narayanan told TOI: “The expert committee is analysing the data,” without elaborating further. The DAC’s task, one scientist said, was to analyse telemetry, ground station records, log books and process documents, and place them on a single timeline before any higher-level inquiry begins.To do this, another scientist said that the DAC has about around six minutes of flight information, recorded at intervals as fine as two milliseconds. He described this as a large amount of material that could reveal the health of the vehicle up to the moment of the anomaly.Isro has not indicated a timeline for the next PSLV launch — built by the HAL-L&T consortium — which was initially expected in the first quarter of this calendar year.Multiple sources confirmed that the mission has been put on hold until the analysis of the PSLV-C62 failure is complete.“The committee [DAC] is in the final leg of its analysis and once it completes the process, the FAC will be formally set up. This could happen very soon, in just a few days,” one source said. Unlike the DAC, which is being headed for a former Isro chairman and comprises internal teams, the FAC will comprise experts from outside the Department of Space (DoS) too.Aside from analysing the data from the PSLV-C62 mission to determine what exactly occurred during the mission, the DAC’s second priority, the scientist said, was to check for any link with the previous failure (PSLV-C61 from May 2025), followed by a complete review of the 33-year-old PSLV vehicle.“Having two repeated failures, it is essential to revisit the entire PSLV once again,” the scientist said. He added that the role of the DAC was to provide all the information that the FAC may require to carry out its analysis.“There will be data from telemetry, ground station, tracking data, other information about processes and tests, all of which need to be analysed and presented properly for the FAC to begin work,” the scientist said.While Isro has not formally said that the launches of other launch vehicles, the agency has been carrying out stringent reviews ahead of all planned missions. As reported by TOI last week, it is gearing up for a GSLV mission, while the planned SSLV mission is said to be put on hold given that its second stage is the same as the PSLV’s third stage (PS3).On Jan 12, after a normal lift-off and second stage performance, the PSLV-C62 suffered a glitch in PS3, which led to the failure. “...Close to the end of the third stage, we saw little more disturbance in the vehicle roll rates and subsequently there was a deviation in the flight path. We are analysing the data and we shall come back at the earliest,” Narayanan had said soon after.","Isro expected to formally constitute a failure analysis committee (fac) to investigate the causes for the mishap and recommend corrective measures soon.

Two decades of sat data show gradual dip in Uttarakhand hills green cover,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/two-decades-of-sat-data-show-gradual-dip-in-uttarakhand-hills-green-cover/articleshow/128129466.cms,"BENGALURU: Satellites watching the sweep of the Himalayas have begun to read the mountains like a slow-moving diary. Grasslands revive with the seasons, forests deepen in colour, and valley flora shifts its pattern, yet the same images also carry warnings of strain. An analysis of two-decade data of Uttarakhand’s vegetation shows how closely the region responds to climate and how those rhythms are starting to falter.Mountain ecosystems react faster than most landscapes to changes in temperature and rainfall. Rising global surface temperatures and altered precipitation patterns are already influencing plant growth, soil moisture, and snow cover. Scientists say this makes local and long-term monitoring essential if govts are to prepare for floods, droughts, and biodiversity loss.To track these changes, researchers from the Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences (ARIES) in Nainital, an autonomous institute under the department of science and technology (DST), worked with Indian and international collaborators using Google Earth Engine, or GEE, a platform that processes large volumes of satellite data.The tool allows scientists to study land degradation, urban growth, dust movement, and temperature trends without the heavy burden of storing raw images.The team examined satellite records from 2001 to 2022 and relied on a widely used indicator called the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The index measures how plants reflect light and provides a simple guide to their health. Low NDVI values point to rock, sand, water, or snow, while higher values signal dense forests, croplands, or wetlands. The researchers also studied the Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), which performs better in areas with thick biomass.Their findings of the study led by Umesh Dumka from ARIES, published in the journal “Environmental Monitoring and Assessment”, reveal clear seasonal cycles. NDVI and EVI peak after the monsoon when hills turn lush, and fall to their lowest levels before the rains. Monthly and yearly variations follow a familiar pattern, yet the long-term graphs show a gradual decline.The study links this drop to deforestation, expanding agriculture, illegal logging, and rising pollution from towns and industries. Pollution, the researchers note, does not strike evenly. Some pockets suffer heavier damage, adding to the stress created by warming temperatures and erratic rainfall. Such pressures threaten wildlife habitats, river systems, and the livelihoods of millions who depend on the mountains downstream.Using time-series maps generated through GEE, the scientists compared vegetation trends with climate data and applied Pearson’s correlation to understand their relationship. The approach allowed them to pinpoint districts where greenery has weakened most sharply.The authors argue that satellite science can serve as an early-warning system. By identifying vulnerable zones, authorities can plan afforestation, regulate construction, and control emissions before losses become irreversible. The Himalayas, they say, are signalling distress in a language of pixels and numbers. Listening to that message may decide how resilient the region remains in the decades ahead.","Mountain ecosystems react faster than most landscapes to changes in temperature and rainfall.

"Instead of foreign data, ICMR wants India’s own evidence to treat lifestyle diseases",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/instead-of-foreign-data-icmr-wants-indias-own-evidence-to-treat-lifestyle-diseases/articleshow/128098205.cms,".

NEW DELHI: In a shift aimed at making medical treatment more relevant to Indian patients, the Indian Council of Medical Research has called for large, multi-centre clinical trials to generate India-specific evidence for treating lifestyle and chronic diseases, instead of relying largely on data from Western countries.The move targets conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, cancer and other non-communicable diseases that affect millions across the country. Health experts say therapies proven effective in Western populations do not always produce the same results in Indian patients because of differences in genetics, diet, climate, disease patterns and access to care.The need for such an approach is already evident in ongoing research. Dr Ambuj Rao, cardiologist at AIIMS Delhi, said India-specific clinical research is essential, pointing to a pan-India influenza vaccine trial in heart attack patients currently underway at AIIMS. He noted that evidence for such interventions cannot come from Western countries because India has a distinct flu season and different public health challenges.Under the initiative, networks of at least five hospitals will jointly evaluate treatments, medical procedures, digital tools and lifestyle interventions in real-world Indian settings.The aim is to identify therapies that are not only clinically effective but also affordable and workable within government hospitals and public health programmes. Officials said the findings will directly inform national treatment guidelines, with each selected study eligible for funding of up to Rs 8 crore over four years.Dr Ravinder Goswami from the endocrinology department at AIIMS Delhi said India’s tropical climate, repeated cycles of stress and poverty, and distinct dietary patterns have led to unique metabolic and hormonal adaptations in Indians, including insulin resistance, higher cortisol levels, central obesity and lower muscle mass. He said rapid lifestyle changes and the growing consumption of refined foods have worsened the burden of diabetes, hypertension, polycystic disorders and other metabolic diseases, which require culturally acceptable and India-specific treatment strategies. The ICMR’s call for well-planned studies, he added, offers a crucial opportunity to generate evidence for conditions unique to India, including certain metabolic disorders and cancers such as oral cancer.Beyond improving treatment protocols, the programme is also expected to strengthen India’s research capacity. Participating hospitals will be required to conduct trials independently, maintain standardised digital records and share data transparently, reducing dependence on pharmaceutical-driven global research.Public health experts say the initiative could have a direct impact on patients, as even small changes in treatment protocols, backed by Indian evidence, can improve outcomes and reduce out-of-pocket spending for families living with chronic disease. If successful, the effort could ensure that what doctors prescribe in India is guided by data generated from Indian patients, not assumptions imported from elsewhere.","The indian council of medical research has called for large, multi-centre clinical trials to generate india-specific evidence.

Planning to visit a bank in February? It’s smart to check the holiday schedule first, as an unexpected closure can turn a quick errand into a wasted trip. In India, banks observe both national and state-specific holidays, so closure dates may differ from one region to another. In India, bank holidays include both national and state-specific observances, so closure dates can vary across different regions.Banks will remain closed in Sikkim on account of the Losar festival.Banks will be closed in Maharashtra for Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Jayanti.Banks will not operate in Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh in observance of State Day/Statehood Day.Apart from these, banks will also remain closed on second and fourth Saturdays of the month, according to RBI.Being aware of bank holidays in advance can help customers plan essential financial transactions and avoid last-minute hassles. While branches may remain closed on these days, it does not prevent customers from carrying out routine transactions. Digital banking services, including online banking, ATMs, mobile apps, and UPI, remain fully operational for fund transfers, bill payments, and other regular activities.However, services that require a physical visit such as large cash deposits, cheque clearances, or issuing demand drafts will not be available. To prevent inconvenience, account holders are encouraged to plan these tasks ahead and make full use of digital banking options during closures.","Banks will be closed in maharashtra for chhatrapati shivaji maharaj jayanti.

We expect this to happen over three to four years, underscoring a ~2% hit on revenue growth each year,” he told ET. He noted that before Palantir’s comments, 30–40% of IT services revenues were already thought to be at risk from AI deflation, particularly in application development, maintenance, and testing.Pathak warned that the scope of AI’s disruption could expand. “If ERP migration and third-party enterprise software, which accounts for 10–15% of industry revenues, come under the purview of AI, the hit from AI would be higher,” he said.The selloff intensified after Palantir’s earnings call highlighted AI’s potential in areas that were once considered safe haven. “The key catalyst was the Palantir earnings call, which highlighted how the company is upending pay-per-seat software such as Workday and ServiceNow, as well as third-party software with its own AI offerings,” Pathak said.Additional factors weighed on sentiment. “Anthropic’s entry into automating low-level legal services work and Gartner’s muted guidance also had a bearing on sentiment,” Pathak added. “While AI’s threat to software coding hours was well known, Palantir’s comments put ERP implementation into the spotlight, which so far was considered less impacted by AI’s productivity gains.”Historical experience suggests that such disruption, while challenging, can ultimately benefit the industry. “AI will render much of legacy software and testing redundant. Just like hyperscalers were initially a significant headwind to infrastructure management services, and BPO got disrupted in an earlier cycle in 2015,” Pathak noted. “Many legacy IMS and BPO roles do not exist anymore, but cloud migration over a five-year period proved accretive for the industry. ”He added that the transition period can be bumpy. “During the early cloud build-out phase in 2016–17, hyperscaler capex expansion initially acted as a revenue headwind for Indian IT services as enterprises paused traditional outsourcing in favour of direct cloud investments. Once the capex cycle normalised, industry growth re-accelerated sharply.”Some analysts, however, see a more positive outlook for IT services compared with software firms. BofA Securities’ Amish Shah explained, “We think that the plug-ins being released by AI companies matter more for the software companies and do not change much for the IT services companies. The broader developments around AI’s use in business have been moving more constructively over the past few months. Companies have been highlighting the increasing opportunity available for them as more AI pilots go into an implementation phase and that their partnership with AI-first companies is driving up demand for enterprise-grade AI solutions. ”Shah also acknowledged emerging concerns. “There has been associated news flow that claims AI tools are helping finish SAP migration in a few weeks versus taking a few years earlier. This has become a new topic of discussion around deflation risk levels in the IT services sector.”From a technical standpoint, the Nifty IT index is at a crucial level, holding 35,400 on a closing basis. “However, a breakdown below this level could potentially create mayhem in the sector,” said Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities. “On the other hand, if the index sustains above 35,400, we can expect a meaningful price recovery in the IT space.”With large-cap IT stocks trading at around 20 times one-year forward earnings, slightly below their 10-year average, Shah recommended caution. “We would continue to maintain a selective stance on the sector and prefer only those companies where visibility of acceleration in growth in FY27 is high, backed by their ability to participate in AI services spends and where there is a proactive and concerted push towards an AI-led operating model,” he told ET.Unmesh Sharma of HDFC Securities offered a balanced view, “We have a neutral position on Indian IT companies in our model portfolio and we continue to hold that."" The expert added that although India may not lead in AI innovation, Indian companies are expected to play a significant role in implementing AI solutions across the corporate sector.","In the past three trading sessions, nifty it index has plunged almost 8%, erroding almost rs 2.5 lakh crore from the market value. Traders are also concerned about concerns over ai automation, that could majorly disrupt the traditional outsourcing model.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128107865,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-86834,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

What Fragrances Will Define Ramadan 2026 for Women? Exploring Arabic Perfume Trends

Why Arabic perfume culture is resonating with women ahead of Ramadan 2026







As the holy month of Ramadan gears up to unfold across the Middle East and beyond, women’s fragrance choices are becoming a meaningful expression of personal style, cultural resonance and sensory storytelling. Arabic perfumes, long celebrated for their rich, evocative compositions, are trending this season not just as gifts or evening scents but as symbolic extensions of the Ramadan experience: warm, comforting and deeply memorable.In 2026, the narrative around women’s fragrances reflects broader industry shifts toward textural sophistication and emotional connection. Global perfumery trends emphasise personalisation, immersive scent experiences and nuanced reinterpretations of classic notes, all of which align beautifully with the rich palette of Arabic perfumery.One of the defining movements in the Ramadan perfume landscape this year is the resurgence of floral-oriental compositions. These perfumes blend soft blossoms like jasmine and rose with deeper bases such as amber and musk, resulting in scents that feel both romantic and sophisticated. For many women, these fragrances strike the perfect balance between everyday elegance and evening allure, suitable for mosque visits, iftar gatherings or Eid celebrations.Floral-oriental profiles are evolving in 2026 to feel more refined and textured. Industry voices note that florals are being paired with unexpected elements of earthier woods, nuanced resins or gourmand undertones, giving traditional blooms a modern and personal expression.As the sun sets and social rhythms begin, many women are drawn toward warm spice and amber compositions. These fragrances open with rich, comforting top notes, often complemented by subtle hints of spice, before settling into amber-clad bases that envelop the wearer in warmth. These profiles are especially beloved for evening wear, when gatherings with loved ones call for something both bold and memorable.In a broader context, amber and spice-driven perfumes resonate with a growing preference for scents that feel like a sensory hug: enveloping, rich and long-lasting. This mirrors global trends where gourmands and amber accords are gaining traction for their comforting, tactile qualities.Another strong current in the Ramadan fragrance story for women is the rise of softly sweet and powdery scents. These are lighter, more approachable compositions featuring gentle sweetness or subtle vanilla-like nuances layered with musky or floral undertones.They are excellent for daytime moments of quiet reflection, casual outings or workplaces where subtlety and elegance are valued over bold projection. This trend toward nuanced sweetness also reflects a shift in the industry where refined gourmand notes feel less dessert-sweet and more textured, mature and wearable.More women are also embracing the idea of scent layering by combining multiple fragrances or formats (like concentrated oils, sprays or body mists) to create something uniquely personal. This approach echoes a broader 2026 trend toward “scent wardrobes” or narrative fragrance experiences, where a perfume isn’t just a single choice but part of a richer sensory identity.Layering allows for playful contrasts like a soft floral with a warm amber base or a light citrus top with a spice-accented dry-down, offering versatility throughout the varied moments of Ramadan and Eid.Arabic perfumes for women this Ramadan are not just trending because of their notes; they are resonating because they bridge tradition and contemporary expression. Their richness and depth reflect cultural heritage, while their evolving compositions align with global fragrance innovations, from gumptious amber blends to nuanced floral artistry.Whether worn for spiritual reflection, family gatherings or festive evenings, these fragrances are helping redefine how scent plays into holiday rituals, turning each application into a small celebration of identity, memory and beauty.","Ramadan 2026 fragrance trends: arabic perfumes for women, floral-oriental and amber scents.

Travis Kelce seems to be worried about Taylor Swift

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce publicly distanced themselves from the pop star’s former best friend, Blake Lively, and her husband, popular Hollywood actor, Ryan Reynolds, ever since their legal drama with Justin Baldoni began.While Taylor Swift could be called to court after her controversial text exchange with Blake Lively was made public, it seems Travis Kelce was never fond of their company.A few hours ago, as per Rob Shuter, a source revealed that, “He hated the double-dating…He felt like it was all optics and no authenticity.”The source added, “Travis is blunt and real…Ryan is curated. That contrast never worked.”Just two months before Taylor Swift was dragged in the legal chaos between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, the pop star and Travis Kelce were spotted on a double date with the Hollywood power couple.That was the last time either Taylor Swift or Travis Kelce were spotted alongside Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds. The two have remained publicly distant from the Hollywood power couple ever since.Around a year ago, there were also strong speculations of Travis Kelce removing Ryan Reynolds from his social media.But neither Travis Kelce nor Ryan Reynolds addressed the speculations in public.While Taylor Swift remains private about her emotions about the situation, it seems Travis Kelce is pretty concerned about her and his future in the league after a pretty poor season on the field.According to The U.S. Sun, a source has said, ""Between a difficult season, the reality of preparing for retirement—which has left him stressed and a bit depressed…”The insider added, “And the looming possibility of Taylor being called to court as a witness, it's been emotionally exhausting and increasingly frustrating for him to handle.""This has also led to many insiders claiming that Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have decided to put their “wedding on hold” until they are able to deal with the issues in their lives.However, both Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have stayed away from confirming these speculations in public.",Travis kelce reportedly felt awkward and forced during outings with taylor swift’s former friend blake lively and ryan reynolds.

Apple iPhone 17e price (expected)

Apple is reportedly gearing up to announce the successor to last year’s iPhone 16e. Likely to be called iPhone 17e, the smartphone “is due imminently”, claims Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman in the latest edition of his weekly PowerOn newsletter. “Apple will market the 17e heavily to users in emerging economies and enterprises — two areas the company plans to target aggressively this year with both devices and software,” Gurman writes in the newsletter. He also shared that the phone will come with a few “big changes” that include iPhone 17’s A19 chipset and MagSafe charging, among others.The upcoming iPhone 17e, Gurman says will be powered by the A19 chip that comes with iPhone 17. The A19 offers a modest boost in CPU speed compared to the A18, but most of its improvement is in GPU, thus allowing it to be even better for AI features and gaming.Further, the handset is tipped to get MagSafe charging feature. Another change coming the iPhone 17e is that it may be equipped with Apple’s newest in-house cellular and wireless chips.Korean news outlet The Elec previously reported that the iPhone 17e is expected to feature slimmer display bezels while retaining the iPhone 14-era OLED panel. Other major new features include an 18MP front camera with Center Stage. This camera automatically extends to show everybody in a group selfie, even when you hold the phone vertically.As far as the pricing of the upcoming iPhone 17e is concerned, Gurman says that the company is planning to keep pricing the same as iPhone 16e. To recall, iPhone 16e launched in 2025 with a price tag of $599 or Rs 59,900 in India.","Apple is reportedly gearing up to announce the successor to last year’s iphone 16e.

Beast Industries strengthens its focus on financial education with Step deal





Beast Industries, the creator-led enterprise built by YouTube sensation MrBeast, said it has acquired Step, a financial technology company focused on money management and financial education. The deal is considered one of the most significant milestones for Beast Industries as it expands into the financial world from digital content. The objective is to assist youngsters with understanding money, such as saving and spending wisely, building credit, and planning for the future. With Step, Beast Industries said it wants to use its enormous reach to bring simple and practical financial tools to a younger audience.MrBeast, whose real name is Jimmy Donaldson, shared that the idea behind the acquisition is deeply personal. He said he never learned about investing, credit, or managing money while growing up, and wants to change that for others. Step already had more than seven million users before the deal and is known for making banking and financial learning easier for teens and young adults. With Beast Industries’ influence and Step’s technology, the companies believe they can make financial education more accessible and less intimidating.Jeff Housenbold, CEO of Beast Industries, said financial health is an important part of overall wellbeing, yet many people lack the right tools and knowledge. He explained that the acquisition is meant to meet audiences where they already are, using technology to help them build better financial habits. Step’s engineering team and fintech platform will now work closely with Beast Industries to develop new products focused on financial wellness.Step’s CEO and co-founder, CJ MacDonald, said the partnership would help the company grow even faster and reach even more users. He said that when it came to helping people and giving back to society, both companies shared similar values. Step has in the past partnered with some of the top investors in the world, including Stephen Curry, Charli D’Amelio, Justin Timberlake, Will Smith, and even The Chainsmokers.The acquisition fits into Beast Industries’ wider strategy of combining creator influence with consumer products and services. Along with popular ventures like Feastables and its philanthropic efforts, the company is now adding financial tools to its portfolio. Step will continue offering banking services powered by Evolve Bank & Trust, with deposits insured up to $1,000,000.Overall, the deal shows how Beast Industries is moving beyond entertainment and into areas that can have a long-term impact. By focusing on financial literacy, MrBeast and his team hope to give millions of young people a stronger and more secure financial future.","Beast industries, the creator-led enterprise built by youtube sensation mrbeast, said it has acquired step.

Ads in ChatGPT: Privacy and safety rules

After weeks of criticism and public jabs from rival Anthropic, OpenAI has started testing ads in ChatGPT. Sharing a blog post, the company said it has started testing ads in the AI tool in the United States and will apply only to logged-in adult users on the Free and Go plans. “We’re starting to roll out a test for ads in ChatGPT today to a subset of free and Go users in the U.S,” OpenAI said in an X post adding “Ads do not influence ChatGPT’s answers. Ads are labeled as sponsored and visually separate from the response. Our goal is to give everyone access to ChatGPT for free with fewer limits, while protecting the trust they place in it for important and personal tasks.”OpenAI said ads are meant to help fund the infrastructure needed to keep the Free and Go tiers running and to support broader access to AI tools. The company said it will study feedback closely before expanding the program.“Keeping the Free and Go tiers fast and reliable requires significant infrastructure and ongoing investment. Ads help fund that work, supporting broader access to AI through higher quality free and low cost options, and enabling us to keep improving the intelligence and capabilities we offer over time,” the company stated in the blog post.OpenAI added that while advertising may grow over time, ChatGPT’s answers will remain independent, and user privacy will remain a core priority.As announced by the company, ads will appear only for adult users on the Free and Go tiers. Paid tiers such as Plus, Pro, Business, Enterprise and Education will remain ad-free. Free users can also opt out of ads, but this will reduce the number of daily free messages they can send.OpenAI said ads will not affect how ChatGPT answers questions and that user conversations will stay private. The company described the move as a limited test aimed at learning from real-world use before any wider rollout.Users will be able to dismiss ads, give feedback, view ad history, delete ad data and manage personalization settings. OpenAI said these controls are meant to give users clear choices over their experience.OpenAI said ads will be clearly labeled as sponsored and shown separately from ChatGPT’s answers. The company stressed that ads do not influence responses. Ads are selected by matching advertiser submissions with the topic of a user’s conversation, along with past chats and past ad interactions.“During the test, we decide which ad to show by matching ads submitted by advertisers with the topic of your conversation, your past chats, and past interactions with ads. For example, if you're researching recipes, you may see ads for meal kits or grocery delivery. If there are multiple advertisers, we'll select the one that is most relevant to your chat to show you first,” OpenAI said in the blog post.OpenAI said advertisers do not have access to your chats, chat history, memories, or personal details. Advertisers will only receive aggregate information about how their ads perform such as number of views or clicks, the company stressed.Further, it will not show ads in accounts where the user is under 18 and “ads are not eligible to appear near sensitive or regulated topics like health, mental health or politics.”",Openai has started testing ads in the ai tool in the united states.

SpaceX prioritises lunar 'self-growing city' over Mars project: Musk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/spacex-prioritises-lunar-self-growing-city-over-mars-project-musk/articleshow/128134560.cms,"Race with China





Elon Musk has said that SpaceX has shifted its focus to building a ""self-growing city"" on the moon, which could be achieved in less than 10 years.SpaceX still intends to start on Musk's long-held ambition of a city on Mars within five to seven years, he wrote on his X social media platform, ""but the overriding priority is securing the future of civilization and the Moon is faster"".Musk's comments echo a Wall Street Journal report on Friday, which said SpaceX has told investors it would prioritize going to the moon and attempt a trip to Mars at a later time, targeting March 2027 for an uncrewed lunar landing.This marks a shift from Musk's long-standing focus on Mars as SpaceX's primary destination.As recently as last year, he said the company aimed to launch an uncrewed Mars mission by the end of 2026.""No, we're going straight to Mars. The Moon is a distraction,"" he said in Jan last year in response to a post on X.Musk has a long record of setting ambitious timelines for projects such as electric vehicles and self-driving technology that have repeatedly failed to materialise on schedule.The US faces intense competition from China to return humans to the moon this decade. Humans have not visited the lunar surface since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972.Less than a week ago, Musk said that SpaceX acquired the artificial intelligence company he also leads, xAI, in a deal that values the rocket and satellite company at $1 trillion and the AI outfit at $250 billion.Proponents of the move view it as a way for SpaceX to bolster its plans for space-based data centres, which Musk sees as more energy efficient than terrestrial facilities as the demand for compute power soars with AI development.SpaceX is hoping a public offering later this year could raise as much as $50 billion, which could make it the largest public offering in history.On Monday, Musk said in response to a user on X that Nasa will constitute less than 5% of SpaceX's revenue this year.SpaceX is a core contractor in Nasa's Artemis moon programme with a $4 billion contract to land astronauts on the lunar surface using Starship.""Vast majority of SpaceX revenue is the commercial Starlink system,"" Musk said. On Sunday, Musk shared the company's first Super Bowl ad, promoting its Starlink Wi-Fi service. Even as Musk reorients SpaceX, he is also pushing his publicly traded company, Tesla, in a new direction. After virtually building the global EV market, Tesla is planning to spend $20 billion this year as part of an effort to pivot to autonomous driving and robots.To speed up the shift, Musk said Jan Tesla is ending production of two car models at its California factory to make room for manufacturing its Optimus humanoid robots.

Ujjwal Chadha, an Indian-origin AI Engineering Lead, has left his job as a Developer at Microsoft in the United States and returned to India for a remote role. He shared on X that the move has changed his life.Chadha mentioned the ""PPP"" advantage, saying that $250,000 is comfortable in Seattle, but it goes a long way in Delhi. His rent dropped by 80 per cent, and his savings rate rose to 90 per cent.He also pointed out the ""Time Dividend,"" saying he no longer deals with long commutes, frozen dinners, or lonely winters. ""Now, I have chai with my parents every evening. I have a cook. I have a driver. I have time,"" he said.About his career, Chadha said he did not step down but ""stepped up."" He added that remote work removes ""visa anxiety"" and lets him focus on building products and his own ideas.His move is part of a bigger trend: Indian tech professionals are the largest group on US H‑1B visas, which let skilled workers join tech, IT, and engineering jobs. Between October 2022 and September 2023, Indians got about 72.3 per cent of all H‑1B visas, enabling many to work for US tech companies and contribute to software innovation.Chadha said, ""I didn't leave the US to retire. I left to actually live.""Since President Donald Trump returned to office a second time, many aspects of US visa processing have grown more challenging for foreign workers and immigrants. US has paused immigrant visa issuance for applicants from a long list of countries, affecting those seeking permanent residency. The overall backlog of US visa and immigration cases has reached record highs, with millions of applications pending amid slower processing and enhanced fraud checks. Changes to H‑1B visas include a new high fee for new applications, and stricter social media vetting has led to appointment cancellations and delays for H‑1B holders abroad. These shifts have increased wait times and pushed them to 2027.","Ujjwal chadha, an indian-origin ai engineering lead, has left his job as a developer at microsoft in the united states and returned to india for a remote role.

Greenland crisis boosted Danish apps designed to identify and help boycott US goods,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/greenland-crisis-boosted-danish-apps-designed-to-identify-and-help-boycott-us-goods/articleshow/128064201.cms,"AP file photo

Canada, Greenland Show Of Power Amid Trump's ‘Invasion’ Storm; 'Difficult Times Are...'





The makers of mobile apps designed to help shoppers identify and boycott American goods say they saw a surge of interest in Denmark and beyond after the recent flare-up in tensions over U.S. President Donald Trump's designs on Greenland.The creator of the ""Made O'Meter"" app, Ian Rosenfeldt, said he saw around 30,000 downloads of the free app in just three days at the height of the trans-Atlantic diplomatic crisis in late January out of more than 100,000 since it was launched in March.Apps offer practical help Rosenfeldt, who lives in Copenhagen and works in digital marketing, decided to create the app a year ago after joining a Facebook group of like-minded Danes hoping to boycott U.S. goods.""Many people were frustrated and thinking, 'How do we actually do this in practical terms,'"" the 53-year-old recalled. ""If you use a bar code scanner, it's difficult to see if a product is actually American or not, if it's Danish or not. And if you don't know that, you can't really make a conscious choice.""The latest version of ""Made O'Meter"" uses artificial intelligence to identify and analyze several products at a time, then recommend similar European-made alternatives.Users can set preferences, like ""No USA-owned brands"" or ""Only EU-based brands."" The app claims over 95% accuracy.""By using artificial intelligence, you can take an image of a product ... and it can make a deep dive to go out and find the correct information about the product in many levels,"" Rosenfeldt told The Associated Press during a demonstration at a Copenhagen grocery store. ""This way, you have information that you can use to take decisions on what you think is right.""'Losing an ally' After an initial surge of downloads when the app was launched, usage tailed off. Until last month, when Trump stepped up his rhetoric about the need for the U.S. to acquire Greenland, a strategically important and mineral-rich Arctic island that is a semiautonomous territory of Denmark.Usage peaked Jan. 23, when there were almost 40,000 scans in one day, compared with 500 or so daily last summer. It has dropped back since but there were still around 5,000 a day this week, said Rosenfeldt, who noted ""Made O'Meter"" is used by over 20,000 people in Denmark but also by people in Germany, Spain, Italy, even Venezuela.""It's become much more personal,"" said Rosenfeldt, who spoke of ""losing an ally and a friend.""Trump announced in January he would slap new tariffs on Denmark and seven other European countries that opposed his takeover calls, only to abruptly drop his threats after he said a ""framework"" for a deal over access to mineral-rich Greenland was reached with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte's help. Few details of that agreement have emerged.The U.S. began technical talks in late January to put together an Arctic security deal with Denmark and Greenland, which say sovereignty is not negotiable.Rosenfeldt knows such boycotts won't damage the U.S. economy, but hopes to send a message to supermarkets and encourage greater reliance on European producers.""Maybe we can send a signal and people will listen and we can make a change,"" he added.The protest may be largely symbolic Another Danish app, ""NonUSA,"" topped 100,000 downloads at the beginning of February. One of its creators, 21-year-old Jonas Pipper, said there were over 25,000 downloads Jan. 21, when 526 product scans were performed in a minute at one point. Of the users, some 46,000 are in Denmark and around 10,000 in Germany.""We noticed some users saying they felt like a little bit of the pressure was lifted off them,"" Pipper said. ""They feel like they kind of gained the power back in this situation.""It's questionable whether such apps will have much practical effect.Christina Gravert, an associate professor of economics at the University of Copenhagen, said there are actually few U.S. products on Danish grocery store shelves, ""around 1 to 3%"". Nuts, wines and candy, for example. But there is widespread use of American technology in Denmark, from Apple iPhones to Microsoft Office tools.""If you really want to have an impact, that's where you should start,"" she said.Even ""Made O'Meter"" and ""NonUSA"" are downloaded from Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store.Gravert, who specializes in behavioral economics, said such boycott campaigns are usually short-lived and real change often requires an organized effort rather than individual consumers.""It can be interesting for big supermarket brands to say, OK, we're not going to carry these products anymore because consumers don't want to buy them,"" she said. ""If you think about large companies, this might have some type of impact on the import (they) do.""On a recent morning, shoppers leaving one Copenhagen grocery store were divided.""We do boycott, but we don't know all the American goods. So, it's mostly the well-known trademarks,"" said Morten Nielsen, 68, a retired navy officer. ""It's a personal feeling ... we feel we do something, I know we are not doing very much.""""I love America, I love traveling in America,"" said 63-year-old retiree Charlotte Fuglsang. ""I don't think we should protest that way.""","""made o'meter"" uses artificial intelligence to identify and analyze several products at a time. Users can set preferences, like ""no usa-owned brands"" or ""only eu-based brands"" another danish app, ""nonusa,"" topped 100,000 downloads at the beginning of february.
