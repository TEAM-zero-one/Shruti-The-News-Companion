"‘For every seat we sell, there are probably 10 takers,’ says Emirates president as Dubai bilaterals not revised for years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-every-seat-we-sell-there-are-probably-10-takers-says-emirates-president-as-dubai-bilaterals-not-revived-for-years/articleshow/121549276.cms,"NEW DELHI: Emirates does not see the huge transit business the mega carrier gets at its Dubai hub from flights to and from India getting impacted by the expansion of Air India and with IndiGo launching long hauls to Europe from next month. The reason: India has so far not acceded to Dubai’s request for increasing the long-exhausted bilaterals or flying rights. As a result, airlines of both India and Dubai are operating the maximum possible flights under the current air service agreement (ASA), with no room to add services till the bilaterals are revised.“We’ve been stuck with 65,000 seats in each direction (Dubai-India and vice-versa) for just over 11 years now (during which period the demand for travel has grown exponentially). For every seat we sell, there are probably 10 takers. So I don’t see getting impacted by IndiGo and Air India expansion plans. In fact, there probably be a major relief valve for the pent up demand that has been in India for decades. Frankly, good luck to AI and IndiGo with getting airplanes at the pace they need,” Emirates Airlines president Tim Clark said Sunday in Delhi, where he is among the global aviation leaders attending the IATA AGM.Stressing the need for more bilaterals, he said: “Fifteen years ago, the population to Dubai was about 25 lakh. This is over 80 lakh. Dubai is one of the fastest growing cities in the world and 40% of the ethnic mix is of Indian origin. If you look at the way the Indian community has moved to and from Dubai over the last 10 or 11 years, you can see the scale of what is not happening by not giving seats to Emirates or wherever else it may be. The Indian government has a policy at the moment of restricting capacity of foreign carriers into India, and they have their own reasons for that.”Clark said he hopes “this will change when (India) realises the significance, the criticality of air transport as a wealth multiplier for their own economy. After all, it's been a it's been a catalyst for so many economies in the last 20-30 years,” he said.India is planning to have aviation hubs at its airports like Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru. “You have to have open access. We (Dubai) have got 80 lakh and we can make a hub out of it. So you have every opportunity on the planet to make a hub and make it very good with your 1.4 billion population. But if you have these sorts of restrictive practices (bilaterals), it doesn't make much sense when you look at the other aspects of Indian economy which are expanding,” he said.He said since the existing bilaterals have been exhausted, there is no possibility of Emirates starting flights to the upcoming airports in India like Navi Mumbai and Greater Noida.",Emirates does not see the huge transit business the mega carrier gets at its dubai hub from flights to and from india getting impacted by the expansion of air india and indigo.

Government mulls doubling safeguard duty on steel from 12% to 24%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/government-mulls-doubling-safeguard-duty-on-steel-from-12-to-24/articleshow/121544149.cms,"This is an AI-generated image used for representational purposes only.

NEW DELHI: The government is evaluating the possibility of increasing the safeguard duty on steel to as much as 24%, from the current 12%, amid concerns that Chinese goods may enter the market and hurt Indian steelmakers.""We have received complaints of Chinese players trying to blunt the impact of the safeguard action by circumventing it. We are mulling over various options,"" a senior government official told TOI.In late April, the government had notified a provisional safeguard duty of 12% for 200 days, and a detailed investigation will be required before a higher duty is imposed.With Chinese goods facing levies and other actions in several markets, especially the US, there are widespread fears of trade diversion with India seen as one of the markets where these goods could be dumped or sold at subsidised prices.India, the world's second-largest crude steel producer, was also a net importer of finished steel for the second consecutive year in 2024-25. Imports are estimated to have neared the 10 million tonne mark.Small players have, however, been complaining about the adverse impact of the safeguard action as they have to deal with higher cost due to a price hike by domestic manufacturers after the safeguard action. The government will seek to strike a balance between the two sides, sources said.","The government is evaluating the possibility of increasing the safeguard duty on steel to as much as 24%, from the current 12%.

"With June 1 here, Bill Belichick’s future takes a twist as buyout plummets to $1 million",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/with-june-1-here-bill-belichicks-future-takes-a-twist-as-buyout-plummets-to-1-million/articleshow/121551831.cms,"Bill Belichick’s dramatically reduced buyout sparks buzz about his next NFL move post-Patriots (Getty Images)

Bill Belichick’s buyout drops to $1M as June 1 arrives — is a surprise NFL return looming?







Bill Belichick’s unconventional offseason with the North Carolina Tar Heels just reached a critical turning point — and it has little to do with Xs and Os. June 1, 2025, is here, and with it comes a significant shift in the power dynamics between Belichick and UNC. The $10 million buyout in his contract has now shrunk to just $1 million, giving the legendary coach newfound leverage to walk away — no strings attached.This change, though buried in contractual fine print, was always the red flag skeptics pointed to when questioning Bill Belichick’s true commitment to Chapel Hill. While many downplayed the importance of this clause, its presence said more than any press conference ever could. If Belichick had truly envisioned himself building a long-term program in North Carolina, he could have simply asked the school to remove the clause. He didn’t.Now, with the reduced buyout officially in play, the dance between the Hall of Fame coach and his new college home just got a lot more complicated — and perhaps a little bit colder.What makes this entire situation even more volatile is the presence of 24-year-old Jordon Hudson, Belichick’s girlfriend and, as some have put it, his de facto brand manager.Their relationship has become tabloid fodder and locker-room curiosity all rolled into one — not least because of the visible influence she seems to wield over the stoic, famously private coach.Channing Crowder didn’t mince words when describing the couple:“She kind of coordinates and brand manages. She has her paws on the situation. It’s different . . . It was weird to be around Belichick and Jordon. . . . I don’t see Belichick in that light. But he just smiles and nods. . . . His old lady is different. . . . She lurks. It’s weird to know him as Coach Belichick running the entire organization as G.M., head coach, talent coordinator, all that stuff, and then to see this tiny, little 95-pound girl kind of — pretty much telling him what to do. ”That last line hit a nerve. Hard. The fallout was swift — an awkward apology from Ryan Clark and an edited version of the show where Crowder’s take was originally aired. But no amount of backpedaling could erase what was said. If anything, it confirmed the underlying tension many suspected: Hudson isn’t just Belichick’s partner — she’s part of the inner circle.Reports that Hudson was banned from UNC’s football facilities only poured fuel on the fire, even if the university denied such claims. Hudson herself clapped back at journalist Pablo Torre in a now-deleted social media post, suggesting the friction is real — and very personal.Belichick, who is no stranger to walking away before the first snap — just ask the New York Jets — now holds the cards. If he senses resistance, if Hudson feels slighted, or if the NFL suddenly calls with an irresistible offer, he can write a check and vanish. A $1 million exit fee is pocket change for a man who would be walking away from a $25 million deal.And let’s not forget: Belichick didn’t sign on at UNC during a hot hiring cycle. His phone wasn’t exactly ringing off the hook with NFL offers. But now, if circumstances change — or if Hudson decides it’s time — he has the power to act.Whether or not Belichick ever coaches a game in Tar Heel blue is no longer just a football question. It’s a story about control, influence, and legacy — and how quickly all of that can pivot when the right clause finally kicks in.Also Read: Travis Kelce startles Adam Sandler in first full ‘Happy Gilmore 2’ trailer as Netflix confirms star-studded sequel premieres July 25","Bill belichick’s contract with the north carolina tar heels ends on june 1, 2025.

LinkedIn lays off hundreds of employees across California: Engineers and others affected

LinkedIn is laying off 281 employees across California, impacting engineers and other units, a report claims. The Microsoft-owned professional networking platform has notified affected workers earlier, a WARN document filed with local officials claims. The job cuts are reportedly distributed across several locations: 159 positions in Mountain View, 60 in San Francisco, 23 in Sunnyvale, 11 in Carpinteria, and 28 remote workers based in California. These layoffs seem to be a part of a larger wave of job reductions at parent company Microsoft. Earlier this month, it was reported that 122 Bay Area Microsoft employees were laid off as part of an estimated 6,000-employee cut across the tech giant. In April, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella also stated that artificial intelligence (AI) was responsible for writing up to 30% of the company's code, which may be the reason behind these job cuts.According to the WARN filing (seen by SF Gate), LinkedIn has laid off a significant number of software engineers. In Mountain View alone, 71 positions across three broad categories of software engineers, including those with “staff” and “senior” in their titles, are being eliminated.This count doesn’t include additional specialists in areas like machine learning, DevOps, and systems infrastructure, some of whom are also affected, the report notes. The filing further lists roles such as deal desk strategists, product managers, designers, and various other professionals among those impacted.However, the report didn’t reveal details about the full extent of the layoffs announced by the company, which is headquartered on the border of Sunnyvale and Mountain View with several other offices worldwide.LinkedIn and its parent company, Microsoft, have yet to respond to inquiries regarding the reasons behind the job cuts, details about severance packages, or whether more layoffs are anticipated.In 2023, when the company laid off 716 employees, LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky addressed the decision in a publicly shared email. So far, no such communication has been released this time. Meanwhile, LinkedIn’s “About Us” page states that the company employs both 18,400 people and more than 18,500 full-time employees.","Linkedin is laying off 281 employees across california, a report claims.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has imposed restrictions on actor Arshad Warsi , his spouse Maria Goretti and 57 other individuals from participating in securities markets for periods ranging from one to five years. This action follows their involvement in deceptive YouTube videos that encouraged share purchases of Sadhna Broadcast.The regulatory body has imposed monetary penalties of Rs 5 lakh each on Warsi and Goretti, alongside a one-year securities market prohibition, according to Sebi's directive issued on Thursday.Additionally, the regulator has imposed financial penalties ranging from Rs 5 lakh to Rs 5 crore on 57 other parties, including the promoters of Sadhna Broadcast (presently known as Crystal Business System Ltd).The regulatory body has instructed all 59 entities to return collective illegal profits of Rs 58.01 crore, with an additional 12 per cent annual interest, to be paid jointly until the complete settlement from the investigation conclusion.According to Sebi's findings, Arshad accumulated profits of Rs 41.70 lakh, whilst his wife gained Rs 50.35 lakh from these activities.The conclusive order identified Gaurav Gupta, Rakesh Kumar Gupta and Manish Mishra as the primary orchestrators of this scheme.The order also revealed that Subhash Aggarwal, a director of SBL's RTA, served as an intermediary between Manish Mishra and the promoters.These people were the key figures who orchestrated and implemented the deceptive plan, according to Sebi.Additionally, Sebi noted that Peeyush Agarwal and Lokesh Shah allowed their controlled accounts to be utilised for the fraudulent strategies of Manish Mishra and SBL's promoters.As a dealer at Choice and owner of the stockbroker's Delhi franchise respectively, they played crucial roles in enabling extensive manipulation of the scrip.Jatin Shah was instrumental in implementing the scheme, whilst other parties either supported the fraudulent activities or participated for quick profits, as stated in the order.According to the 109-page directive, Sebi indicated that the noticees acted as information intermediaries or helped execute manipulative trades, without trading the scrip through their personal accounts.Sebi explained that the organised scheme was carried out in two coordinated stages. Initially, connected and promoter-associated entities conducted trades amongst themselves to gradually increase the scrip price and create artificial market activity.The small-volume transactions had an outsized effect on pricing, primarily due to limited market liquidity. This enabled the involved parties to elevate the share value whilst deploying minimal trading resources.Subsequently, promotional content was broadcast via various YouTube platforms including 'Moneywise', 'The Advisor', and 'Profit Yatra', which were under Manish Mishra's management, as stated in the directive.These video presentations portrayed SBL as an attractive investment prospect and were strategically released to complement and enhance the orchestrated market activities.","Sebi has imposed monetary penalties of rs 5 lakh each on warsi and goretti.

Expanded withdrawal purposes

The Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) is set to revolutionize the way millions of employees access their provident fund (PF) savings. Starting June 2025, EPF members will be able to instantly withdraw PF funds via Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and ATMs, according to DD News.This major step is being implemented with the support of the Ministry of Labour and Employment and has already received approval from the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). The new facility will also allow users to check their PF balance directly on UPI platforms and transfer funds to their bank accounts without delays.Currently, PF withdrawals involve submitting online claims followed by a waiting period for approval from EPFO field offices. This process can take several days or even weeks. However, the upcoming integration with UPI and ATMs is expected to make settlements instantaneous. Members will be allowed to withdraw up to ₹1 lakh instantly—especially helpful in emergencies.“EPFO has made significant improvements in its digital infrastructure by integrating over 120 databases,” said Sumita Dawra, Secretary at the Ministry of Labour and Employment.“These efforts have reduced claim processing time to just three days, with 95 per cent of claims now being processed automatically. Further upgrades are also in progress to make the system even more efficient.”Currently, the EPF scheme allows withdrawals for medical emergencies, housing, education, and marriage, but members must meet specific eligibility criteria and provide proper documentation. With the upcoming changes, the scope of permitted withdrawal reasons will be expanded, giving employees greater financial flexibility for key life events.In another significant development, pensioners under the Employees’ Pension Scheme (EPS) of 1995 will be able to access their pensions from any bank branch across India starting January 1, 2025. This means retirees will no longer be restricted to specific banks or branches.Even if a pensioner relocates or changes banks, pension disbursal will continue seamlessly through the Centralised Pension Processing System (CPPS), eliminating the need to transfer Pension Payment Orders (PPO) between offices.","Starting june 2025, epf members will be able to instantly withdraw pf funds via unified payments interface (upi) and atms.

At the end of March 2025, bank credit to NBFCs stood at Rs 16.4 lakh crore, marking a modest growth of 5.7% in FY25.This was significantly lower than the overall bank credit growth of 11% during the year, to Rs 182 lakh crore, indicating a cooling in lending appetite toward shadow banks.The slowdown in credit to NBFCs was part of a broader trend. Lending to large industries also moderated in April. The share of loans to large corporates declined to 15% of total bank credit, down from 16% at the end of March 2024. In comparison, housing loans now account for a larger share at 16.6%, underlining the shift in bank lending preferences toward the retail segment. Overall, the industry's share in total bank credit fell to 21.4% from 22% a year ago.Bank loans to individuals against gold jewellery continued to grow adding Rs 3,427 crore during April 2025 taking the total outstanding to Rs 2.2 lakh crore. In FY24, bank loans against jewellery had risen 103% to Rs 2.08 lakh crore a large part of which was due to reclassification of gold-backed agri loans.Data from 41 major scheduled commercial banks, which account for about 95% of all non-food credit, showed that year-on-year bank credit growth stood at 12% in the fortnight ended March 21, 2025.This was lower than the 16.3% growth recorded in the same period last year, reflecting a broad deceleration in credit expansion.Credit to agriculture and allied activities grew by 10.4% in March 2025, compared to 20% in the corresponding period last year. Lending to industry rose by 8%, the same as the previous year. While sectors such as petroleum, metal products, engineering, and construction saw higher credit offtake, lending to infrastructure slowed. The services sector also saw a deceleration, with credit rising by 13.4%, down from 20.8% a year earlier. This was mainly due to a sharp slowdown in bank loans to NBFCs, although credit to professional services and trade remained robust.In the personal loan segment, growth eased to 14% from 17.6% in the previous year. The deceleration was mainly due to lower growth in vehicle loans, credit card outstandings and other personal loans, indicating a cooling in consumer demand for credit.","Bank lending to non-banking finance companies slowed sharply in april.
