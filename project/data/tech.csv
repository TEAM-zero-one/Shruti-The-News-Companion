NEW DELHI: Now, all vegetable oil producers and processors will have to furnish monthly details of arrival of raw materials, production, import, sale, export and stock in hand to the food ministry, a move that will help the govt get real-time updates on availability rather than depending on data from their associations.The ministry has amended the Vegetable Oil Products, Production and Availability (VOPPA) Regulation Order of 2011 by notifying fresh changes. Industry sources said India has over 15,000 oil mills and more than 250 vanaspati manufacturing units. Most of them are in the small-scale sector.The new order focuses on enhanced monitoring of edible oil imports, production, stocks and sales through digital tools. Recently, speaking on the sidelines of an industry event, food secretary Sanjeev Chopra had said now they are groping in dark because they are dependent on associations for data.He had also said under the new framework, the govt will track production, pricing and availability in real-time, providing critical data to industry stakeholders, while improving compliance, market monitoring and product integrity.As per the new notification, issued on Friday, a producer who intends to produce, stock for sale or offer for sale of vegetable oil, vegetable oil products or solvent extracted oil will need to apply for registration. The director of directorate of sugar and vegetable oils or any person appointed for it can inspect any premises.","The ministry has amended the vegetable oil products, production and availability (voppa) regulation order of 2011.

Who is Mira Murati? Former OpenAI CTO who rejected Mark Zuckerberg’s $1 billion offer to join Meta AI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/who-is-mira-murati-former-openai-cto-who-rejected-mark-zuckerbergs-1-billion-offer-to-join-meta-ai/articleshow/122994020.cms,"Mira Murati: The mind behind ChatGPT and beyond

Thinking Machines Lab: a startup with billion-dollar belief

Why Murati’s team said no to Meta

A name to watch in AI’s future





Mira Murati, the Albanian-American tech visionary behind some of the most significant breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, is once again in the spotlight—this time for turning down an eye-watering $1 billion offer from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg . As the former CTO of OpenAI and now the founder of the AI startup Thinking Machines Lab, Murati has become one of the most influential figures in the global AI race. Her team's unanimous rejection of Meta’s massive offer speaks volumes about their confidence in her leadership and their belief in the startup’s long-term vision.Before launching Thinking Machines Lab, Mira Murati served as the chief technology officer at OpenAI, one of the most influential positions in the modern AI world. During her tenure, she played a pivotal role in leading the development of groundbreaking technologies such as ChatGPT, DALL·E, and Codex—systems that have since transformed the way people interact with artificial intelligence. She also oversaw OpenAI's deployment of safety protocols that became foundational to industry-wide AI governance frameworks. Her work helped bring generative AI into the mainstream, sparking a global wave of innovation across industries from education and healthcare to design and coding.Murati wasn’t just a technical leader—she was a strategic visionary. At OpenAI, she emphasized the importance of safety, alignment, and responsible development, pushing the organization to think deeply about the societal impact of powerful AI systems.Internally, she earned the reputation of being the “AI brain” behind OpenAI’s most ambitious projects, praised for her calm, focused demeanor and her ability to guide multidisciplinary teams through intense periods of innovation. She was instrumental in assembling the original alignment teams, ensuring ethical considerations were baked into product design from the earliest stages. Murati once remarked, “We don’t just code intelligence—we craft responsibility,” a phrase that has since become a rallying cry for ethical AI development. Her combination of engineering precision and human-centered thinking set the stage for her next bold move: founding her own AI company.In early 2025, she delivered a keynote at the World Economic Forum in Davos, warning that “AI without values is intelligence without conscience,” sparking international dialogue on AI ethics and sovereignty. She’s also been advising the European Commission on emerging AI regulatory frameworks, a rare role for a startup founder. Her ability to bridge the worlds of deep tech and global policy has made her one of the few technologists shaping both the tools and the laws that will define this century. Her growing influence in policy circles signals that she’s not just building AI—but helping shape the rules by which it will operate.Founded in early 2025, Thinking Machines Lab has rapidly emerged as one of the most-watched AI startups. Despite not launching a single product yet, the company recently raised a stunning $2 billion seed round at a valuation nearing $12 billion, led by Andreessen Horowitz. The startup’s goal: to create customizable, interpretable, and widely accessible AI systems that could redefine the AI landscape. The company is pioneering customizable, interpretable AI systems designed to be tailored to local languages, cultures, and industries—advancing the democratization of advanced AI technology globally. Industry insiders say the company’s stealth mode only adds to its mystique. With Murati at the helm, expectations are sky-high for what comes next.According to a Wired report, Zuckerberg's Meta offered some of Murati’s team members compensation packages ranging from $200 million to $1 billion to join its newly launched Superintelligence Lab. But every single offer was turned down. Sources say the Thinking Machines Lab team believes their equity in the startup has the potential to be worth far more—and more importantly, they value their independence and Murati’s vision over big-tech paychecks. This wasn't just a rejection of Meta—it was a stand against the commodification of AI talent.In a tech industry where massive paydays often drive decisions, the loyalty displayed by Murati’s team stands out. The rejection of Meta’s lucrative offers highlights their belief in the startup’s mission and long-term potential. Their decision also reflects a broader shift in tech culture—one where founders and engineers alike are prioritizing purpose, values, and trust over headline-making payouts. Many observers also note that the chance to help shape AI’s future from the ground up, without the constraints of a corporate giant, is a rare and meaningful opportunity—one Murati has worked hard to create.Mira Murati’s leadership has already been recognized worldwide—she was featured in Time’s 100 Most Influential People in AI (2024) and Fortune’s 100 Most Powerful Women in Business (2023). With Thinking Machines Lab gaining momentum and Meta's billion-dollar offers rebuffed, Murati has solidified her place not just as a builder of AI—but as a shaper of its future. She has become a quiet icon of resistance against the centralization of AI power—choosing to innovate outside the usual corporate echo chambers.","Mira murati, founder of thinking machines lab, turned down $1 billion offer from meta ceo mark zuckerberg.

Angela Price breaks silence on Sydney Sweeney’s ‘good jeans’ ad backlash

Angela defends American Eagle’s history of diversity



Angela Price, wife of NHL star Carey Price, is weighing in on the backlash surrounding Sydney Sweeney’s American Eagle ad. As critics slam the campaign for promoting unrealistic beauty standards, Angela offers a grounded take—calling Sweeney “incredibly attractive” and defending the brand’s history of inclusivity from her own personal experience.Carey Price’s wife, Angela Price, isn’t one to shy away from hot-button topics—and her latest Instagram Q&A proves just that. As social media continues to debate Sydney Sweeney’s American Eagle billboard that plays on the phrase “good jeans” (a pun that critics say sexualizes and objectifies the actress), Angela chimed in with her own surprisingly grounded take.“When I first saw it, I thought, ‘Yeah, she definitely has great genes because she’s incredibly attractive,’” Angela wrote. “But hey, that’s just my two cents from someone who likes to keep it real and sensible.”Angela’s response stood out for its calm, measured tone at a time when the ad has become a cultural flashpoint. Critics claim it sends the wrong message by focusing too heavily on appearance and idealized beauty standards. Others have even called it racially insensitive. But Angela—who used to work with American Eagle herself—pushed back on that narrative.“I have a soft spot for the AE brand; I spent a good part of my youth working with them,” she said. “If you check out their past ads, they showcase people of all shapes, sizes, ethnicities, and support diverse groups.”That quiet endorsement of the brand comes amid a social media firestorm, where people are accusing American Eagle of promoting a narrow definition of beauty. The brand, however, maintains the ad was never about anything other than denim: “Sydney Sweeney Has Great Jeans” is and always was about the jeans. Her jeans. Her story.”Also Read: Katy Perry and Justin Trudeau romance rumors slammed by ex-NHL star as George Kittle reveals disturbing fan incident Angela and Carey now live in Kelowna, British Columbia, with their three children.

‘Bill Gates has no role in toxic food coating’: Michelle Pfeiffer apologises after spreading misinformation; what is the controversy about Apeel’s food coating,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bill-gates-has-no-role-in-toxic-food-coating-michelle-pfeiffer-apologises-after-spreading-misinformation-what-is-the-controversy-about-apeels-food-coating/articleshow/123037875.cms,"Bill Gates’ name wrongly linked to Apeel in viral misinformation

How did Apeel respond

Pfeiffer apologizes and retracts earlier claims

The larger debate on food tech, trust, and responsibility





In July 2025, actress Michelle Pfeiffer sparked controversy when she shared posts on social media claiming that Apeel, a food technology company backed by Bill Gates , was contaminating organic produce. Pfeiffer's posts stated that organic produce ""is no longer safe"" because Apeel's edible plant-based coating, recently approved by the USDA for organic certification, is invisible and ""cannot be washed off. "" She implied a direct connection between Gates and ownership of Apeel. Shortly after, Apeel clarified that Bill Gates has no ownership or involvement in the company beyond two small grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation in 2012 and 2015. Pfeiffer later apologized, acknowledging she had shared outdated and inaccurate information about Apeel and its safety.Apeel Sciences, founded in 2012, develops an edible coating made from plant-derived ingredients such as citric acid and baking soda, designed to extend the shelf life of fruits and vegetables and reduce food waste. The product, called OrganiPeel, was formally FDA approved in 2024 and has been used in grocery stores since 2017. Apeel received two grants totaling approximately $1.1 million from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, but Bill Gates himself is neither a founder, shareholder, nor involved in operations. The company emphasizes its commitment to sustainability and improving food access worldwide.On July 10, 2025, Michelle Pfeiffer shared posts warning her followers that organic produce coated with Apeel was no longer safe to consume, emphasizing the coating's supposed invisibility and inability to wash off.She also posted a list of major grocery chains that do not sell Apeel-coated produce. These claims echoed long-running social media smear campaigns that falsely accused Apeel of contaminating food and overstated Gates's involvement. The misinformation prompted backlash from Apeel, its representatives, and many food safety experts who contested Pfeiffer’s assertions.Apeel representatives firmly denied the allegations related to food safety and company ownership. They stressed that their product is edible, made from responsibly sourced plant oils, and can be removed by simply rinsing and gently scrubbing produce. Apeel also clarified that Bill Gates has ""zero involvement or ownership"" in the company, and that the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation's funding was limited to grants with no controlling influence. The company reaffirmed its transparent mission to reduce food insecurity and improve sustainability in food systems.Three weeks after her initial posts, Pfeiffer returned to social media to issue a public apology. She admitted to unintentionally sharing outdated and inaccurate information about Apeel's product and ownership. Pfeiffer confirmed having spoken directly with Apeel representatives, learning that OrganiPeel is neither a new product nor exclusively linked to Bill Gates. She emphasized the importance of accurate public conversations on food safety and sustainability and expressed regret for spreading misinformation.This incident reflects ongoing tensions and misinformation in public discourse surrounding new food technologies and influential figures like Bill Gates. While some commentators applauded Pfeiffer for raising awareness, others criticized the spread of unverified claims that fuel distrust in science-based innovations. Apeel's case highlights the challenges companies face in balancing transparency, innovation, and public perception amid rapid advances in food technology. Pfeiffer's correction serves as a reminder of the responsibility public figures hold in verifying information before sharing it widely.","Actress michelle pfeiffer sparked controversy when she shared posts on social media claiming that apeel, a food technology company backed by bill gates, was contaminating organic produce.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123037889,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-54030,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Starting August 1, 2025, India’s Unified Payments Interface (UPI) the backbone of digital transactions will witness a significant upgrade. These changes, implemented by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), are designed to make UPI safer, more efficient, and capable of handling ever-growing transaction volumes.India processes over 12 billion UPI transactions per month, and the system is under constant pressure, especially during peak usage hours. The new rules focus on controlling excessive server requests, protecting users from fraud, and improving overall transaction experience. Key updates include balance enquiry limits, fixed auto-payment windows, restrictions on bank detail access, and enhanced recipient verification measures.If you use Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, Amazon Pay, or any bank-based UPI app, these changes will directly impact your daily transactions.UPI apps often receive millions of daily balance check requests, creating heavy server traffic. From now, users can check their account balance only 50 times per day. To reduce inconvenience, the system will automatically display available balance after every transaction, eliminating the need for repeated manual checks.Auto-debits (subscriptions, loan repayments, OTT payments) create sudden load spikes during peak banking hours.From August 1:Users can now view linked bank accounts only 25 times per day. This prevents misuse by malicious apps or repeated refresh requests, improving data safety and reducing load on bank servers.Many users repeatedly check the status of pending transactions, which strains servers. Now, users can check transaction status only three times, with a mandatory 90-second gap between attempts. This change aims to cut down unnecessary traffic while still giving users visibility of their funds.Before confirming any payment, the recipient’s registered name and transaction ID will be displayed. This feature prevents accidental transfers to incorrect UPI IDs or fraudulent accounts pretending to be legitimate businesses.NPCI has warned UPI app providers: failure to implement these changes could lead to API restrictions, financial penalties, or suspension of new customer onboarding.The decision to update UPI rules stems from two main concerns:No. Sending and receiving money remains unaffected. The rules focus mainly on balance checks, auto-pay processing, and fraud prevention features.Excessive balance requests (especially by third-party apps) cause unnecessary server load. Limiting to 50 checks per day ensures stable performance for all users.Recurring payments may be processed slightly earlier or later than scheduled. Users will receive notifications when payments are executed, preventing missed due dates.Yes, but only three times, with a 90-second gap between attempts. This helps free up system resources for actual money transfers.Yes, they are part of NPCI’s long-term strategy to manage growing UPI traffic and improve user safety.","India’s unified payments interface (upi) the backbone of digital transactions will witness a significant upgrade.

Reddit’s financial earnings



Reddit is all set to make a bold pivot towards becoming a full-fledged search engine. Reddit CEO Steve Huffman recently announced the plans to prioritise search functionality and AI-powered answers across the platform. The announcement came as part of the company's Q2 2025 shareholder letter, which highlighted strong financial performance driven by advertising and a growing user base. “Reddit a go-to search engine, and expanding internationally,” said Huffman. The move comes amid explosive growth in Reddit’s internal search usage, which now sees over 70 million weekly queries.During the earnings call, CEO Steve Huffman framed the initiative as a natural evolution for the platform, which has long been the de facto search engine for millions seeking genuine, opinion-based answers. ""For years, people have been adding 'reddit' to their search queries to find real experiences, recommendations, and discussions,"" Huffman stated. ""Our communities are the world's most valuable database of human experience. We're simply building the infrastructure to make that wisdom more accessible and searchable.""Reddit’s pitch is simple: real people, real answers. In a world increasingly dominated by algorithmic summaries, Reddit believes that nuanced, lived experiences are irreplaceable. A recent survey showed that 80% of users trust human responses over AI-generated ones for complex questions.“To focus on the areas that matter most, we are deprioritising a few initiatives, including our work on the user economy. It’s still an opportunity we believe in, but we’re concentrating our resources on the areas that will drive results for our most pressing needs: improving the core product, making Reddit a go-to search engine, and expanding internationally,” said Huffman.Reddit’s Q2 revenue hit $500 million, up 78% year-over-year, with a net income of $89 million and a gross margin of 90.8%. Advertising revenue alone soared to $465 million, driven by new AI-enhanced ad formats like Conversation Summary Add-ons, which boost clickthrough rates by 10%.With Q3 revenue projected between $535 million and $545 million, Reddit is doubling down on search, deprioritizing other initiatives like its user economy to focus on core product improvements and international growth.","Reddit ceo steve huffman recently announced the plans to prioritise search functionality and ai-powered answers across the platform.

ChatGPT-5 could redefine intelligence and risk

A stepping stone to AGI?

Internal and external pressure on OpenAI

As artificial intelligence continues to advance at an astonishing pace, even the leaders at its forefront are beginning to voice concern. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has openly admitted feeling “scared” about the upcoming release of GPT-5, the newest and most powerful version of ChatGPT. Scheduled to launch in August 2025, GPT-5 is expected to significantly surpass its predecessors in speed and capability. Yet it is precisely this rapid evolution that has led Altman to compare its development to the Manhattan Project. His candid remarks, shared during a recent podcast appearance, highlight growing unease about the lack of oversight, ethical uncertainty, and the accelerating race toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI).Speaking on Theo Von’s This Past Weekend podcast, Altman confessed that testing GPT-5 left him with a profound sense of unease. “It feels very fast,” he said, referring not just to the model’s impressive processing power, but to the alarming speed at which AI is advancing overall. His remarks echoed the reflective anxiety of scientists involved in the Manhattan Project, who, after creating the atomic bomb, grappled with the unintended consequences of their innovation. Altman invoked a similar moment of reckoning, asking rhetorically, “What have we done?” The comparison underscores his concern that GPT-5, like nuclear technology before it, may mark a pivotal turning point—one where humanity’s ability to build something outpaces its readiness to understand or control the fallout.He emphasized that while technical achievements are accelerating, the moral, social, and legal frameworks to contain them are not keeping pace. He explicitly stated that testing GPT-5 left him “very nervous” and that its development feels reminiscent of a science fiction thriller.One of Altman’s most pointed comments was about the lack of control in AI development. “It feels like there are no adults in the room,” he said, suggesting that regulatory frameworks have not kept up with AI's breakneck speed. While OpenAI advocates for responsible deployment, the pace at which GPT-5 was built may have outstripped safety protocols and human readiness. These remarks have sparked fresh debate about who, if anyone, is truly in charge of monitoring such transformative technologies.While specifics about GPT-5 remain under wraps, insiders suggest it will feature major upgrades over GPT-4, including improved multi-step reasoning, longer memory, and more advanced multimodal capabilities. It is also expected to reduce model-switching delays, offering more seamless user interactions. But with power comes risk. Altman has openly said that GPT-4 “kind of sucks” compared to what’s coming next. That raises alarms about how much more potent and possibly uncontrollable GPT-5 could be. Concerns are mounting about how society will distinguish between authentic human thought and AI-generated insightAltman has long discussed AGI, or Artificial General Intelligence, as OpenAI’s north star. But GPT-5 may be the company’s closest step yet to that goal. While Altman once claimed the arrival of AGI would pass with little societal upheaval, his new tone is more cautionary. If GPT-5 gets us significantly closer to AGI-level capabilities, the lack of global consensus on how to manage such a leap could become a major problem. The shift from AI that assists to AI that independently reasons and acts could happen faster than institutions can respond.Behind the scenes, OpenAI is reportedly under immense pressure from investors to transition into a for-profit entity by year-end. With Microsoft holding a 13.5 billion dollar stake in the company, and other competitors like Google DeepMind and Perplexity.ai surging forward, GPT-5 could be a make-or-break moment. Some reports even suggest OpenAI might declare AGI prematurely to end its contract with Microsoft, triggering new power dynamics in the AI sector.While some observers have dismissed Altman’s remarks as theatrical marketing, his track record suggests otherwise. His fear appears genuine, not of AI turning evil, but of humans losing control over the systems they’ve built. In a space where speed is often equated with success, Altman’s words might be the first honest pause in a race most of the world barely understands.","Openai ceo sam altman has openly admitted feeling “scared” about the upcoming release of gpt-5, the newest and most powerful version of chatgpt.

KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Ev market share in nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including norway, singapore and ethiopia.

In a first-of-its-kind initiative, Dubai has unveiled a virtual Emirati family powered by artificial intelligence, aimed at enhancing the city’s digital outreach and supporting its smart transformation strategy. Developed by Digital Dubai, the project introduces interactive characters designed to embody Emirati culture and connect with a broad audience through familiar, human-like storytelling. The rollout began with the debut of ""The Girl,"" the family's first member, and plans are underway to reveal more characters that will collectively represent a modern Emirati household in digital form.Digital Dubai's new initiative introduces the first AI-generated ""Emirati Family,"" intended to act as a bridge between government services and the public. Each virtual character is designed using advanced AI and data technologies, forming a highly interactive digital interface.The AI-generated Emirati family is designed not just to represent culture but to function as an active communication tool in Dubai’s digital ecosystem. Beyond general awareness, these virtual characters are likely to be used for public announcements, policy updates, and important government messages, delivered in a simplified, interactive format.By humanising digital communication, they could help make government information more transparent, relatable, and easier for the public to understand and engage with.The debut of the first family member, referred to as “The Girl,” marks the beginning of the rollout. She was introduced in a short video shared on social media, where she appears in a playful scene at a park, wearing traditional Emirati attire with a contemporary touch. The character has been purposefully designed to appear warm, friendly, and relatable, especially to children and families.To increase public engagement, Digital Dubai launched a naming campaign, inviting citizens and residents to vote for her name. The three shortlisted options were: Dubai, Mira, and Latifa. This participatory element is part of the initiative’s larger goal of fostering dialogue around digital technology and AI in everyday life.Additional members of the virtual family, including a father, mother, and brother, will be introduced soon, creating a complete digital representation of a modern Emirati household. Each member will play a role in communicating key aspects of Dubai’s digital services.The core aim of the AI family is to make government communication more engaging, culturally grounded, and easy to understand. Instead of traditional formats, the characters will deliver government messages and public service announcements in ways that resonate emotionally with people, using visuals and language tailored to their lifestyles and cultural context.The initiative is structured to reach:By transforming digital services into human-like, narrative-driven interactions, the virtual family serves as a storytelling vehicle that simplifies public messaging while reinforcing core Emirati values.Dubai’s growing focus on AI is also being recognised at the global level. In the 2025 Global AI Cities Index, published by Counterpoint Research, a technology market research firm that evaluates innovation, readiness, and AI integration across major urban centres, Dubai ranked among the top five cities worldwide for AI adoption.Key highlights from the index:Top-ranked cities include:The momentum behind AI innovation isn’t limited to Dubai.
