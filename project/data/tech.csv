The introduction of the product not only spread joy but also tied up a bond between Pettersson and the audience, revealing a part of his life that was off-hockey.Elias Pettersson was on the ice and assisted two times, but the offense of the Jets was overwhelming. Pettersson's performance and Swete's sell-out debut still made the night unforgettable for the spectators.Katelyn Byrd's Swete was gone in a flash, indicating the fans who adore chocolate like NHL players, while Pettersson's showing brought to mind his importance for Vancouver Hockey.More coverage on NHL","Elias pettersson’s wife, katelyn byrd, steals the spotlight as her swedish candy brand “swete” sells out in minutes.

Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason





Gates Foundation recently announced $2.5 billion commitment over the next five years to advance women's health initiatives worldwide. The funding aims to fuel dozens of projects, from life-saving maternal medicines to vaccines targeting infections that hit women hardest. The pledge marks a roughly 33% jump in the foundation's investments in women's and maternal health compared to the prior half-decade. It is the largest funding commitment the Gates Foundation has made in women’s health. The pledge also is a sign of the areas where Bill Gates wants to focus on as he seeks to donate the vast majority of his $114 billion fortune before winding down the foundation over the next 20 years. Gates spoke about the pledge during an event with STAT this week.The vast majority of the funds — as much as 70% — will go to research and development. About a tenth will go to market introduction of new technologies or generating better data around them. Only about 4% will go to manufacturing, and 3% to advocacy. ""It's curious why some of these areas are so under-invested, because the rich world health burden on preeclampsia specifically is still, you know, very high,"" Bill Gates remarked during a briefing, highlighting one of the hypertensive disorders that claim thousands of women's lives annually, even in wealthy nations.The portfolio brims with high-tech promise. Backed by the foundation's dollars will be self-injectable contraceptives for easier access, long-lasting contraceptive patches, lightning-fast diagnostics for STIs, and deep dives into the human microbiome's role in everything from pregnancy complications to broader women's health challenges, including disease transmission.Yet Bill Gates was clear-eyed about the foundation's boundaries. ""One thing we make very clear is we're not able to replace what the U.S. government has canceled,"" he said, nodding to recent federal budget trims in global health programs. Gates told STAT, ""It's just not our role to say, OK, the U.S. government wants to save money and so we'll help them do that.""In fields like malaria, tuberculosis, and non-hormonal birth control, the Gates Foundation already reigns as the world's top funder, Gates noted. Its R&D bets will yield lasting innovations that outlive the organization's support. But for on-the-ground health delivery, the clock is ticking: The foundation's aid is designed to be temporary, hinging on sustainable handoffs to other players.Even with Gates' immense wealth as a backstop, he stressed the need for collective action. A core aim, he and his team emphasised, is to ignite urgency among governments, pharmaceutical giants, and researchers to prioritise women's health disparities—long overlooked despite their outsized toll.""We'd love to have other people work on this stuff,"" Bill Gates said. ""It's crazy that this stuff isn't better funded. Drawing governments and other philanthropists in—we've had some success at that, and I'm putting more time into talking with other philanthropists about how impactful this work is. So I think we'll have a lot of additional partnerships, certainly at the end of the 20 years"", he added.""Then we're gone,"" he added pointedly, ""and so other people will have to step up in these areas.""As the foundation accelerates its sunset strategy, this women's health push underscores a pivotal shift: from lone-wolf giving to catalysing a broader ecosystem. With maternal deaths still claiming a life every two minutes globally, advocates hailed the commitment as a vital spark—one that could, if multiplied, finally bend the arc toward equity.Recently, the Gates Foundation announced a $2.5 billion commitment through 2030 to advance women’s health, marking its largest-ever investment in the field. The funding will support a wide range of initiatives — from developing new medicines to prevent maternal deaths to creating vaccines that target infections disproportionately affecting women.The new pledge represents a roughly one-third increase in the foundation’s funding for women’s and maternal health compared to the past five years. It is also a small illustration of the kinds of commitments that Bill Gates is making as he seeks to donate the vast majority of his $114 billion fortune before winding down the foundatio",Gates foundation recently announced $2.5 billion commitment over the next five years to advance women's health initiatives worldwide.

Siddhant Awasthi’s journey through Tesla: From Model 3 to Cybertruck





Siddhant Awasthi’s impact on Tesla and the Cybertruck









Siddhant Awasthi, Tesla’s head of the Cybertruck programme, has announced his departure after more than eight years with the company. Rising from an intern to a senior leadership role, Awasthi played a key part in shaping several of Tesla’s landmark projects, including the Model 3, the Shanghai Gigafactory, and the groundbreaking Cybertruck. In a LinkedIn post, he reflected on his journey, highlighting the challenges and achievements that defined his career. Known for his technical expertise and leadership skills, Awasthi’s exit marks the end of a significant chapter for Tesla, leaving a lasting legacy on the company’s electric vehicle programmes and demonstrating the impact of innovation, dedication, and collaborative effort in advancing Tesla’s mission and shaping the future of sustainable automotive technology worldwide.Awasthi’s career at Tesla began as an intern immediately following his graduation in 2018. He quickly impressed the leadership with his technical expertise and drive, earning a promotion to engineering manager within two years. This rapid rise continued when he became senior technical programme manager, overseeing the development of the Cybertruck’s 48-volt architecture.By late 2022, as Tesla prepared to start production of the Cybertruck, Awasthi was appointed head of the electric truck programme.He oversaw not only the production ramp-up but also planned future upgrades for Tesla’s high-profile pickup. This trajectory demonstrates both his technical prowess and capacity to lead complex engineering projects at a young age. During his eight-year tenure, Awasthi contributed to multiple core Tesla projects. He was integral to the Model 3 ramp-up, ensuring production efficiency and reliability. He also worked on the Shanghai Gigafactory, helping establish Tesla’s manufacturing footprint in China.His work extended to the development of new electronics and wireless architectures, critical components in Tesla’s advanced electric vehicles. Finally, Awasthi delivered the Cybertruck, Tesla’s most ambitious pickup project to date, known for its futuristic design and advanced technology. His multifaceted contributions showcase a rare blend of engineering skill, programme management, and innovation.In his social media post, Awasthi expressed deep gratitude toward Elon Musk and Tesla’s leadership. He called his colleagues “talented, driven, and truly rockstar,” recognising the collaborative effort required to execute Tesla’s high-intensity projects. He also thanked Tesla’s customers for their support, noting that the company’s vehicles have positively impacted lives by improving safety and delivering tangible value.This acknowledgment underscores Awasthi’s perspective on teamwork and mentorship as essential to career growth, as well as his appreciation for the culture and leadership at Tesla. Despite Awasthi’s leadership, the Cybertruck has faced commercial challenges. Tesla initially aimed to produce 250,000 units annually, yet current sales reportedly remain around 25,000 per year. These figures highlight the complexity and unpredictability of launching a revolutionary vehicle.Nonetheless, Awasthi’s role in guiding the Cybertruck from concept to delivery has been significant. His work on vehicle architecture, production ramp-up, and future upgrades demonstrates a lasting legacy on Tesla’s electric truck programme. Reflecting on his time at Tesla, Awasthi described it as a “thrilling journey,” filled with high-intensity work across multiple programmes. From the Model 3 to the Shanghai Gigafactory and finally the Cybertruck, he emphasised the personal and professional growth he experienced.","Awasthi’s career at tesla began as an intern immediately following his graduation in 2018.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stage for a candid and humours conversation. The tech titans shared their thoughts on the future on generative AI and the long road to building tech empires. In a lighthearted moment, Huang joked that if he had known how long it would take to succeed, the he might have followed Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s oath and dropped out of college early. “If I had known it was going to take so long to succeed… I would've dropped out of college just like you,” Huang quipped, drawing laughter from the audience and Zuckerberg himself.The discussion involving Huang and Zuckerberg spanned around decades of innovation. The discussion started with Zuckerberg praising Huang’s role in powering the AI revolution. “It’s all you—you kind of made this happen,” Zuckerberg said, referring to Nvidia’s dominance in AI infrastructure.Responding to Zuckerberg, Jensen Huang said, “Why thank you… CEOs, we're delicate flowers,” poking fun at the need for appreciation even at the top.Along with this, the two tech leaders also joked about aging and appearances.“We’re pretty grizzled at this point,” Zuckerberg said. “I think we’re the two longest-standing founders in the industry.” Huang agreed, noting his gray hair while Zuckerberg commented on his curls.Huang founded Nvidia in 1993 with just the investment of $200. He launched the company on his 30th birthday which was later joined by co-founders Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. Nvidia started with a mission to advance 3D graphics. The breakthrough came in 1999 with the invention of the GPU, a technology that transformed computing.Fast forward to October 2025, Nvidia has entered the $5 trillion club. The chip maker managed to reach the market valuation of $5 trillion in just three months after crossing $ 4 trillion. This growth in Nvidia's market value suggest the escalating momentum in AI adoption across industries. Shares of Nvidia rose more than 4%, pushing its market capitalisation. Nvidia ranks ahead of Microsoft ($4 trillion) and Apple ($3.9 trillion), as well as Google parent Alphabet ($3.2 trillion), Amazon ($2.4 trillion) and Meta ($1.8 trillion).Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s journey started from his dorm room in Harvard in 2004, from where he started Facebook . He famously dropped out in 2005 to focus on the company, turning down his father’s offer to invest in a McDonald’s franchise. Today, Meta is valued at $1.6 trillion.","Nvidia ceo jensen huang and meta ceo mark zuckerberg took the stage for a candid and humours conversation.

Scale AI CFO pushes back: “We are alive and well”





Mark Zuckerberg unveils three new Meta AI smart glasses

Business is still booming





Moving ahead without Alexandr Wang





Facebook-parent Meta stunned the Silicon Valley in June this year by announcing a $14.3 billion investment in AI startup — Scale AI. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made this investment to primarily onboard Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang and other top executives of the company. This move by Meta trigged an immediate speculation about the Scale AI’s viability, with major clients like OpenAI, Google, and Elon Musk’s xAI reportedly pausing work with the startup. The industry insiders also felt that the company had been effectively acquired, leaving its future uncertain. However, after almost five months after the investment made by Meta, Scale AI CFO Dennis Cinelli has pushed back this speculation. Speaking to CNBC in an interview, Cinelli said that ‘We are a company that signed some of the best deals we have had in the history of our company, just in the last two or three months. We are not a Zombie.”Emphasising on the fact that Scale AI has signed some of its best deals in recent months, Cinelli told CNBC, “We’re not a zombie company,”. Along with this, he also dismissed the claims that the investment made by Meta was a licensing or acquihire deal.He emphasised that Scale AI is still an independent and completely operational.Founded in 2016, ScaleAI is known for its data-labelling services and custom AI applications for governments and enterprises. Cinelli told CNBC that both the divisions of the company are growing with revenue “well into the nine figures.” He also revealed that Scale AI recently secured two major contracts with the US Department of Defense which value $99 million and $100 million in August and September, respectively.Scale AI fired about 14% of its workforce in July, soon after Meta made the investment of $14.3 billion, but the company started the process of hiring and has hired 200 new employees. Along with this, the AI company is also working on expansion and is opening new offices in New York, Washington D.C., St. Louis, and London. Despite alls this, the San Francisco still remains the largest hub of the company where it is occupying 180,000 square feet of former Airbnb space.The departure of Alexandr Wang from the company was considered to a major loss. He was the world’s youngest self-made billionaire until October but Cinelli insists the “vast majority” of employees remain. Facebook-parent Meta now owns 49% stake in ScaleAIwhich is valued around $29 billion, but the company has no voting power or product integration. “Scale’s data business has grown every month since the Meta deal, and its applications business has doubled in the second half of 2025 compared with the first half. Scale expects the applications unit to be the primary revenue driver for the company in the future,” Cenelli told CNBC.",Scale ai cfo pushes back: “we are alive and well” facebook-parent meta made a $14.3 billion investment in ai startup scale ai.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says ‘Slack creates a lot of fake work’; Elon Musk responds: ‘As I was saying …’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sam-altman-says-slack-creates-a-lot-of-fake-work-elon-musk-responds-as-i-was-saying-/articleshow/125213230.cms,"There are positives about Slack

but I kind of dread the first hour of the morning or last time before I go to bed, where I’m just dealing with this explosion of Slack.

It creates a lot of fake work.”

“As I was saying, OpenAI will compete directly with Microsoft.”

""At this point, it’s insanely suicidal for Microsoft to continue supporting OpenAI"".





Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reacted sharply to Sam Altman ’s remarks about office productivity tools like Slack, saying that the ChatGPT-maker OpenAI will “compete directly with Microsoft”. Sam Altman, founder and CEO of OpenAI recently said that while there are many positives about Slack, it also creates a “lot of fake work”. In a now viral clip, Altman about how current workplace tools — such as Slack, Google Docs, email, and PowerPoint — may soon be replaced by a new generation of AI-driven systems.,” Altman said, “Altman added that he believes a new kind of AI-powered productivity platform is within reach — one where “your AI agent and my AI agent” will handle most communication and tasks, escalating only when necessary.Elon Musk, who has long been critical of OpenAI’s close partnership with Microsoft, responded on X (formerly known as Twitter) with a pointed remark:In another post on X, Elon Musk wrote:The exchange comes as AI companies race to redefine workplace productivity. While Microsoft has heavily invested in “Copilot” features across its apps, Altman’s comments suggest OpenAI could be developing its own tools that may compete in the same space.In a recent post shared on X, Altman suggested that the company is planning another major new business venture, putting it in direct competition with cloud technology giants, including Google, Amazon and Microsoft.Sam Altman wrote in the post: “We are also looking at ways to more directly sell compute capacity to other companies (and people); we are pretty sure the world is going to need a lot of 'AI cloud', and we are excited to offer this.”This means OpenAI could soon start selling cloud services, putting it in competition with established providers such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud. In September, OpenAI Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Sarah Friar made a similar point, suggesting that cloud providers had been “learning on our dime.” Her comment indicated that OpenAI was looking to safeguard its AI expertise from technology companies that may use its developments to advance their own capabilities.Notably, after the GPT-5 launch earlier in the year, Musk warned Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella about competition posed by OpenAI. “OpenAI is going to eat Microsoft alive,” he said.","Tesla ceo elon musk has reacted sharply to sam altman ’s remarks about office productivity tools like slack.

""A few months ago, we decided to shut down Switch's Sherburn, UK, facility as operating there was no longer viable.

Amrutesh Vallabhaneni, an H-1B visa holder in the US, has brought a lawsuit against his employer, accusing the company of forced labor, labor trafficking and withholding visa documents, Breitbart News reported. Jay Palmer, Vallabhaneni's consultant who prepared the lawsuit, said it is a Squid Game for Indian workers in the US job market, as the ultimate goal is to stay in America, surviving the exploitative culture, created by Indian CEOs. These Indian-origin CEOs import their ""home-country caste discrimination politics"" to their workplaces in the US, Palmer said.According to the report, Vallabhaneni studied in India, got an F-1 student visa and a loan to attend a US college in 2015. Then he got OPT (Optional Practical Training), worked at a New Jersey company and then in 2018 moved to the company that he sued. He moved to the company as they promised him H-1B. The lawsuit said that the company violated laws and asked Vallabhaneni to pay his own salary for a period of six months. They also did not pay Vallabhaneni the prevailing wage.But after all this, Vallabhaneni was not free to leave the company as they allegedly threatened to withdraw his H-1B if he did not comply with their requests.The company also promised a green card but continued to pressure Vallabhaneni to accept their terms and conditions; otherwise he would have to leave the US.""Despite being guaranteed a wage by the DOL, AV (Amrutesh Vallabhaneni) often barely had enough money for rent and living expenses for himself and his family.
