Is Nico Harrison’s tenure in Dallas Mavericks coming to an end?

Nico Harrison’s job in jeopardy as Dallas Mavericks ownership weighs in-season front office change

Despite requests from the fan base to dismiss general manager Nico Harrison , the Dallas Mavericks had apparently previously granted him a special privilege this season. Since he dealt Luka Doncic to the Los Angeles Lakers in February, Harrison has been unpopular in Dallas.Now that the storm clouds over Dallas are getting darker, Nico Harrison is the center of attention. Marc Stein claims that it is now ""unavoidable at the highest levels"" for the Mavericks to avoid thinking about making a front-office change in the middle of the season. Hired in 2021 to modernize the team and improve player relations, the once-promising executive is now in danger of losing his job before the All-Star break.Now that Harrison is becoming quiet unpopular, the Mavericks must take action. This is because as per the insiders, the idea that could result in Harrison's dismissal is ""based on the premise that the front office executive who conceived and pushed for the widely criticized Doncic deal can no longer be the one trying to pilot the organization past it.""Internal discussions on Harrison's future are being driven by three main factors, according to Stein's most recent report.They are the necessity for a change in attitude, the desire to win back upset supporters, and the growing perception that ""the GM who traded Luka Doncic, can no longer be the one who tries to move the Mavericks past it.""Insiders have also revealed certain reasons as to why Nico should have been fired long back. He recommended Luka Doncic be traded. Additionally, when he exchanged Quentin Grimes for Caleb Martin, they should have dismissed him.The moment they won the Cooper Flagg lottery, they also should have fired him. Furthermore, when Flagg was forced to switch to point guard due to the reported unbalanced roster he built, they ought to have dismissed him during the preseason.Any of those times would have been the ideal time to fire Nico Harrison. However, now, it appears that Dallas is finally taking it into account. Insider Marc Stein tweeted on Sunday:""The rising and virtually ceaseless negativity that surrounds the franchise is indeed wearing on and troubling ownership.""Although club governor Patrick Dumont would prefer to give Harrison more time, Stein points out that ""contemplating whether an in-season change is the wisest course for the Mavericks to try to forge ahead post-Doncic has become unavoidable at the highest levels of the organization.""However, having said that, the Mavs' management haven't said anything as of yet regarding Harrison's firing. They have neither accepted nor refuted the rumor.Also read: Has Nico Harrison been fired?

Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason





Gates Foundation recently announced $2.5 billion commitment over the next five years to advance women's health initiatives worldwide. The funding aims to fuel dozens of projects, from life-saving maternal medicines to vaccines targeting infections that hit women hardest. The pledge marks a roughly 33% jump in the foundation's investments in women's and maternal health compared to the prior half-decade. It is the largest funding commitment the Gates Foundation has made in women’s health. The pledge also is a sign of the areas where Bill Gates wants to focus on as he seeks to donate the vast majority of his $114 billion fortune before winding down the foundation over the next 20 years. Gates spoke about the pledge during an event with STAT this week.The vast majority of the funds — as much as 70% — will go to research and development. About a tenth will go to market introduction of new technologies or generating better data around them. Only about 4% will go to manufacturing, and 3% to advocacy. ""It's curious why some of these areas are so under-invested, because the rich world health burden on preeclampsia specifically is still, you know, very high,"" Bill Gates remarked during a briefing, highlighting one of the hypertensive disorders that claim thousands of women's lives annually, even in wealthy nations.The portfolio brims with high-tech promise. Backed by the foundation's dollars will be self-injectable contraceptives for easier access, long-lasting contraceptive patches, lightning-fast diagnostics for STIs, and deep dives into the human microbiome's role in everything from pregnancy complications to broader women's health challenges, including disease transmission.Yet Bill Gates was clear-eyed about the foundation's boundaries. ""One thing we make very clear is we're not able to replace what the U.S. government has canceled,"" he said, nodding to recent federal budget trims in global health programs. Gates told STAT, ""It's just not our role to say, OK, the U.S. government wants to save money and so we'll help them do that.""In fields like malaria, tuberculosis, and non-hormonal birth control, the Gates Foundation already reigns as the world's top funder, Gates noted. Its R&D bets will yield lasting innovations that outlive the organization's support. But for on-the-ground health delivery, the clock is ticking: The foundation's aid is designed to be temporary, hinging on sustainable handoffs to other players.Even with Gates' immense wealth as a backstop, he stressed the need for collective action. A core aim, he and his team emphasised, is to ignite urgency among governments, pharmaceutical giants, and researchers to prioritise women's health disparities—long overlooked despite their outsized toll.""We'd love to have other people work on this stuff,"" Bill Gates said. ""It's crazy that this stuff isn't better funded. Drawing governments and other philanthropists in—we've had some success at that, and I'm putting more time into talking with other philanthropists about how impactful this work is. So I think we'll have a lot of additional partnerships, certainly at the end of the 20 years.""""Then we're gone,"" he added pointedly, ""and so other people will have to step up in these areas.""As the foundation accelerates its sunset strategy, this women's health push underscores a pivotal shift: from lone-wolf giving to catalysing a broader ecosystem. With maternal deaths still claiming a life every two minutes globally, advocates hailed the commitment as a vital spark—one that could, if multiplied, finally bend the arc toward equity.",Gates foundation recently announced $2.5 billion commitment over the next five years to advance women's health initiatives worldwide.

Siddhant Awasthi’s journey through Tesla: From Model 3 to Cybertruck



Siddhant Awasthi’s impact on Tesla and the Cybertruck







Siddhant Awasthi, Tesla’s head of the Cybertruck programme, has announced his departure after more than eight years with the company. Rising from an intern to a senior leadership role, Awasthi played a key part in shaping several of Tesla’s landmark projects, including the Model 3, the Shanghai Gigafactory, and the groundbreaking Cybertruck. In a LinkedIn post, he reflected on his journey, highlighting the challenges and achievements that defined his career. Known for his technical expertise and leadership skills, Awasthi’s exit marks the end of a significant chapter for Tesla, leaving a lasting legacy on the company’s electric vehicle programmes and demonstrating the impact of innovation, dedication, and collaborative effort in advancing Tesla’s mission.Awasthi’s career at Tesla began as an intern immediately following his graduation in 2018. He quickly impressed the leadership with his technical expertise and drive, earning a promotion to engineering manager within two years. This rapid rise continued when he became senior technical programme manager, overseeing the development of the Cybertruck’s 48-volt architecture.By late 2022, as Tesla prepared to start production of the Cybertruck, Awasthi was appointed head of the electric truck programme.He oversaw not only the production ramp-up but also planned future upgrades for Tesla’s high-profile pickup. This trajectory demonstrates both his technical prowess and capacity to lead complex engineering projects at a young age. During his eight-year tenure, Awasthi contributed to multiple core Tesla projects. He was integral to the Model 3 ramp-up, ensuring production efficiency and reliability. He also worked on the Shanghai Gigafactory, helping establish Tesla’s manufacturing footprint in China.His work extended to the development of new electronics and wireless architectures, critical components in Tesla’s advanced electric vehicles. Finally, Awasthi delivered the Cybertruck, Tesla’s most ambitious pickup project to date, known for its futuristic design and advanced technology. His multifaceted contributions showcase a rare blend of engineering skill, programme management, and innovation.In his social media post, Awasthi expressed deep gratitude toward Elon Musk and Tesla’s leadership. He called his colleagues “talented, driven, and truly rockstar,” recognising the collaborative effort required to execute Tesla’s high-intensity projects. He also thanked Tesla’s customers for their support, noting that the company’s vehicles have positively impacted lives by improving safety and delivering tangible value.This acknowledgment underscores Awasthi’s perspective on teamwork and mentorship as essential to career growth, as well as his appreciation for the culture and leadership at Tesla. Despite Awasthi’s leadership, the Cybertruck has faced commercial challenges. Tesla initially aimed to produce 250,000 units annually, yet current sales reportedly remain around 25,000 per year. These figures highlight the complexity and unpredictability of launching a revolutionary vehicle.Nonetheless, Awasthi’s role in guiding the Cybertruck from concept to delivery has been significant. His work on vehicle architecture, production ramp-up, and future upgrades demonstrates a lasting legacy on Tesla’s electric truck programme. Reflecting on his time at Tesla, Awasthi described it as a “thrilling journey,” filled with high-intensity work across multiple programmes. From the Model 3 to the Shanghai Gigafactory and finally the Cybertruck, he emphasised the personal and professional growth he experienced.","Siddhant awasthi, tesla’s head of the cybertruck programme, has announced his departure after more than eight years with the company.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stage for a candid and humours conversation. The tech titans shared their thoughts on the future on generative AI and the long road to building tech empires. In a lighthearted moment, Huang joked that if he had known how long it would take to succeed, the he might have followed Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s oath and dropped out of college early. “If I had known it was going to take so long to succeed… I would've dropped out of college just like you,” Huang quipped, drawing laughter from the audience and Zuckerberg himself.The discussion involving Huang and Zuckerberg spanned around decades of innovation. The discussion started with Zuckerberg praising Huang’s role in powering the AI revolution. “It’s all you—you kind of made this happen,” Zuckerberg said, referring to Nvidia’s dominance in AI infrastructure.Responding to Zuckerberg, Jensen Huang said, “Why thank you… CEOs, we're delicate flowers,” poking fun at the need for appreciation even at the top.Along with this, the two tech leaders also joked about aging and appearances.“We’re pretty grizzled at this point,” Zuckerberg said. “I think we’re the two longest-standing founders in the industry.” Huang agreed, noting his gray hair while Zuckerberg commented on his curls.Huang founded Nvidia in 1993 with just the investment of $200. He launched the company on his 30th birthday which was later joined by co-founders Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. Nvidia started with a mission to advance 3D graphics. The breakthrough came in 1999 with the invention of the GPU, a technology that transformed computing.Fast forward to October 2025, Nvidia has entered the $5 trillion club. The chip maker managed to reach the market valuation of $5 trillion in just three months after crossing $ 4 trillion. This growth in Nvidia's market value suggest the escalating momentum in AI adoption across industries. Shares of Nvidia rose more than 4%, pushing its market capitalisation. Nvidia ranks ahead of Microsoft ($4 trillion) and Apple ($3.9 trillion), as well as Google parent Alphabet ($3.2 trillion), Amazon ($2.4 trillion) and Meta ($1.8 trillion).Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s journey started from his dorm room in Harvard in 2004, from where he started Facebook . He famously dropped out in 2005 to focus on the company, turning down his father’s offer to invest in a McDonald’s franchise. Today, Meta is valued at $1.6 trillion.","Nvidia ceo jensen huang and meta ceo mark zuckerberg took the stage for a candid and humours conversation.

Scale AI CFO pushes back: “We are alive and well”





Mark Zuckerberg unveils three new Meta AI smart glasses

Business is still booming





Moving ahead without Alexandr Wang





Facebook-parent Meta stunned the Silicon Valley in June this year by announcing a $14.3 billion investment in AI startup — Scale AI. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made this investment to primarily onboard Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang and other top executives of the company. This move by Meta trigged an immediate speculation about the Scale AI’s viability, with major clients like OpenAI, Google, and Elon Musk’s xAI reportedly pausing work with the startup. The industry insiders also felt that the company had been effectively acquired, leaving its future uncertain. However, after almost five months after the investment made by Meta, Scale AI CFO Dennis Cinelli has pushed back this speculation. Speaking to CNBC in an interview, Cinelli said that ‘We are a company that signed some of the best deals we have had in the history of our company, just in the last two or three months. We are not a Zombie.”Emphasising on the fact that Scale AI has signed some of its best deals in recent months, Cinelli told CNBC, “We’re not a zombie company,”. Along with this, he also dismissed the claims that the investment made by Meta was a licensing or acquihire deal.He emphasised that Scale AI is still an independent and completely operational.Founded in 2016, ScaleAI is known for its data-labelling services and custom AI applications for governments and enterprises. Cinelli told CNBC that both the divisions of the company are growing with revenue “well into the nine figures.” He also revealed that Scale AI recently secured two major contracts with the US Department of Defense which value $99 million and $100 million in August and September, respectively.Scale AI fired about 14% of its workforce in July, soon after Meta made the investment of $14.3 billion, but the company started the process of hiring and has hired 200 new employees. Along with this, the AI company is also working on expansion and is opening new offices in New York, Washington D.C., St. Louis, and London. Despite alls this, the San Francisco still remains the largest hub of the company where it is occupying 180,000 square feet of former Airbnb space.The departure of Alexandr Wang from the company was considered to a major loss. He was the world’s youngest self-made billionaire until October but Cinelli insists the “vast majority” of employees remain. Facebook-parent Meta now owns 49% stake in ScaleAIwhich is valued around $29 billion, but the company has no voting power or product integration. “Scale’s data business has grown every month since the Meta deal, and its applications business has doubled in the second half of 2025 compared with the first half. Scale expects the applications unit to be the primary revenue driver for the company in the future,” Cenelli told CNBC.",Scale ai cfo pushes back: “we are alive and well” facebook-parent meta made a $14.3 billion investment in ai startup scale ai.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says ‘Slack creates a lot of fake work’; Elon Musk responds: ‘As I was saying …’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sam-altman-says-slack-creates-a-lot-of-fake-work-elon-musk-responds-as-i-was-saying-/articleshow/125213230.cms,"



Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reacted sharply to Sam Altman ’s remarks about office productivity tools like Slack, saying that the ChatGPT-maker OpenAI will “compete directly with Microsoft”. Sam Altman, founder and CEO of OpenAI recently said that while there are many positives about Slack, it also creates a “lot of fake work”. In a now viral clip, Altman about how current workplace tools — such as Slack, Google Docs, email, and PowerPoint — may soon be replaced by a new generation of AI-driven systems.“There are positives about Slack,” Altman said, “but I kind of dread the first hour of the morning or last time before I go to bed, where I’m just dealing with this explosion of Slack. It creates a lot of fake work.”Altman added that he believes a new kind of AI-powered productivity platform is within reach — one where “your AI agent and my AI agent” will handle most communication and tasks, escalating only when necessary.Elon Musk, who has long been critical of OpenAI’s close partnership with Microsoft, responded on X (formerly known as Twitter) with a pointed remark: “As I was saying, OpenAI will compete directly with Microsoft.”In another post on X, Musk wrote: ""At this point, it’s insanely suicidal for Microsoft to continue supporting OpenAI""The exchange comes as AI companies race to redefine workplace productivity. While Microsoft has heavily invested in “Copilot” features across its apps, Altman’s comments suggest OpenAI could be developing its own tools that may compete in the same space.In a recent post shared on X, Altman suggested that the company is planning another major new business venture, putting it in direct competition with cloud technology giants, including Google, Amazon and Microsoft.Sam Altman wrote in the post: “We are also looking at ways to more directly sell compute capacity to other companies (and people); we are pretty sure the world is going to need a lot of 'AI cloud', and we are excited to offer this.”This means OpenAI could soon start selling cloud services, putting it in competition with established providers such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud. In September, OpenAI Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Sarah Friar made a similar point, suggesting that cloud providers had been “learning on our dime.” Her comment indicated that OpenAI was looking to safeguard its AI expertise from technology companies that may use its developments to advance their own capabilities.","Sam altman, founder and ceo of openai recently said that while there are many positives about slack, it also creates a “lot of fake work” elon musk has reacted sharply to altman’s remarks, saying that the chatgpt-maker openai will “compete directly with microsoft”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125213222,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-28312,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Stephen Curry loses it over Jimmy Butler's new wavy hair at the barber shop

Jimmy Butler doesn’t merely change his hairstyles; he alters the dialogue. The latest excitement unfolded in a barbershop where Butler sat back, getting his hair styled into long, flowing waves, echoing the vibe from his 2023 emo media day. The video, uploaded on both his and Stephen Curry’s Instagram on November 10, 2025, showcases a candid, funny interaction between two stars.Curry strolls in with a black hoodie and a backpack, all set to chat like usual. But then he spots Butler. He halts. He narrows his eyes. The confusion shifts to disbelief, and soon enough, he bursts into laughter. Not the soft kind. The loud, doubled-over, can’t-catch-his-breath kind. Text in the clip says “Curry reacts to Jimmy Butler’s new hairstyle,” and it went viral right away. In just a few hours, fans on Instagram and X were sharing, joking, and quoting the moment.The video shared by Stephen Curry on Instagram on November 10, 2025, shows a cozy, fun moment at what looks like a barber shop. Butler is in the chair, getting his hair done into long, wavy locks that remind everyone of his well-known 2023 ""emo"" phase.The stylist is focused on their work while Butler engages in a relaxed conversation.Curry enters the frame wearing a black hoodie and backpack, initially greeting Butler with a friendly ""How you been?"" He pauses, squinting in confusion, before exclaiming, ""I ain't going to lie. What's wrong with you bro? Man a lot."" The realization hits, and Curry doubles over in uncontrollable laughter, pointing at Butler's exaggerated new do. Text overlays in the clip read: ""Curry reacts to Jimmy Butler's new hairstyle! 😂✂️""After seeing this, social media exploded with all sorts of comments like one user on X commented, “The NBA Would Be Better With More Jimmy Butlers In The League...” While another said, “😂 Jimmy look like the lady that design the incredibles costume”.For a long time, Jimmy Butler has been famous for his daring style choices, grabbing attention beyond just the basketball court. In 2023, at the Miami Heat media day, he introduced an 'emo' haircut complete with side-swept bangs and dark eyeliner, leading to a wave of memes and conversations online. The look was so controversial that it became a cultural reference point, and Butler even joked about it in later interviews.In 2022, Butler's newfound dreadlocks gave an added pizazz to his game. These wooden changes are not merely gimmicks, but a reflection of Butler's shameless personality. Following the reveal in 2023 Butler noted to reporters, ""I'm just being me"" - further emphasising how comfortable he is with aquatic life. This last new style in the video cuts back to that ""media day hair"" look (fluffy waves), and most importantly dubbed that ""auntie chic"" style.Butler has always loved trying out different styles. Dreadlocks in 2022. Emo hairstyle in 2023. He’s never been concerned with what’s considered 'normal.' This latest look keeps that vibe going. Loud. Bold.

“Welcome @sk7037 to OpenAI!

Incredibly excited to work with him on designing and building our compute infrastructure, which will power our AGI research and scale its applications to benefit everyone.”

“Excited for the opportunity to work with @gdb (Greg Brockman), @sama (Sam Altman) and the @OpenAI team on building out the compute infrastructure for AGI! Very grateful for the tremendous opportunity and experience at Intel over the last 4 years leading networking, edge computing and AI. Privilege of a lifetime to have worked closely with @LipBuTan1, @PGelsinger and @nickmckeown1.”





Intel AI chief and chief technology officer Sachin Katti has left to join ChatGPT-maker OpenAI . In a statement, the chip maker said that its CEO, Lip-Bu Tan, will now oversee the company’s artificial intelligence (AI) division. “We thank Sachin for his contributions and wish him all the best. Lip-Bu will lead the AI and Advanced Technologies Groups, working closely with the team,” Intel said. “AI remains one of Intel’s highest strategic priorities, and we are focused on executing our technology and product roadmap across emerging AI workloads,” the company added.Katti, who joined Intel four years ago and previously taught at Stanford University, was promoted to chief technology officer and chief AI officer earlier this year. His exit marks another leadership change under Tan, who took over as Intel’s CEO in March and has since restructured the company.Intel has been working to catch up in the AI chip market, where Nvidia and TSMC currently dominate. While its central processors power some AI systems, the company has yet to produce a competitive data center AI chip.Tan has been reshaping Intel’s leadership, expanding executive roles and hiring new talent from outside the company as he attempts to steer a turnaround at the struggling chipmaker.Sharing a post on X, OpenAI President Greg Brockman said:Katti responded, writing:",Sachin katti has left intel to join chatgpt-maker openai.

A Redditor made a controversial post about his experience of coming back to India after 7 years.





A Redditor's post went viral after the man questioned his decision to come back to India after staying seven years in one of the happiest European countries. The man spoke about pollution, traffic, civic sense of people and also complained about India's fruits and milk. Summing up his experience in India, the Redditor said everything is messed up here.""Returned to india after 7 years from one of the happiest European country. Main reason was, I am a single child so wanted to stay with parents when they are aging. It's been 6 months now but we (me and my wife) are not able to adjust here. We try to find positive things but honestly it's so difficult. Never wanted fancy things in life but simple things like peaceful walk, taking kids to open public spaces nearby , spending time in nature without going far are not possible. Air is polluted, food is not good ( fruits and milk specially ), traffic and roads are so bad. Biggest concern is civic sense. It is so bad that my kid keep asking me so many questions.His life was much better there and I feel I did injustice to him. Approaching 40 in few years and after coming back realized that surviving here professionally with this much experience is very difficult for my skillset. Seems everything is messed up in india,"" the man wrote.As the Redditor did not mention the state in India, social media users pointed out that it's unrealistic to expect that everything in India would change only in seven years. ""You should not have come back. And if you can, go back now. India will become only worse from here,"" one wrote.Some agreed with the Redditor's point of view and opined that India was much different and better when these people left India. ""People have that picture of India and all of a sudden that picture is broken once they are back to this new India,"" one wrote.""What is the purpose of your post? If you can move back to your foreign country please do. Otherwise, what are you even asking here. Or are trying to imply that those who are returning to their home to be with parents or for whatever reasons should not return because YOU do not like it in India. What a way of imposing your personal limited world view on other Indians!"" one wrote.

Denmark to ban social media for children under 15,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/denmark-to-ban-social-media-for-children-under-15/articleshow/125183637.cms,"Representative image

What other activities are planned?



Australia leads the world in banning social media for children







The Danish government has reached an agreement to implement a minimum age requirement of 15 years old on certain social media platforms, it announced on Friday.The move follows Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen's call for restrictions on children's use of social media in her opening speech to Parliament last month, due to concerns over youth mental health. A majority of parties in parliament said they would support the plan.""As one of the first countries in the EU, Denmark is now taking a groundbreaking step towards introducing age limits on social media,"" said the country's digitalization ministry in a statement. ""This is done to protect children and young people in the digital world.""""As a starting point, children under the age of 15 should not have access to platforms that may expose them to harmful content or harmful features,"" the statement said.The ministry did not specify which social media platforms are affected or how the ban will be enforced.However, exceptions can be made if parents believe their child should have access to social media at an earlier age. According to the statement, parents will have the opportunity to consent to their children's access, if their children are as young as 13.The agreement also envisages allocating 160 million Danish kroner (€21.4 million; $24.8 million) to 14 initiatives aimed at strengthening the protection of children and young people online and creating a better framework for their digital lives.As part of the agreement, EU's Digital Services Act supervision will be strengthened, and funds will be allocated to support the development of alternative social media platforms. Additionally, extra efforts will be made to combat illegal marketing by influencers, the statement mentioned.A coalition of lawmakers ""are making it clear that children should not be left alone in a digital world where harmful content and commercial interests are too much a part of shaping their everyday lives and childhoods,"" the ministry said.""Children and young people have their sleep disrupted, lose their peace and concentration, and experience increasing pressure from digital relationships where adults are not always present,"" it said. ""This is a development that no parent, teacher or educator can stop alone.""""Denmark is now leading the way in Europe with a national age limit for social media and a concerted effort to strengthen the digital wellbeing of children and young people,"" Digitalization Minister Caroline Stage said.""We are taking a necessary stand against a development where large tech platforms have had free rein in children's rooms for far too long.""This Danish plan follows Australia's lead. In December, Australia is set to become the first country to ban social media for children, setting the minimum age at 16.In September, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told a United Nations forum in New York that she was ""inspired"" by Australia's ""common sense"" decision to enact age restrictions.The legislation subjects social media platforms to fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars (€30 million; $32.3 million) for allowing children under 16 to create accounts.On Wednesday, Australia announced that it had added the message board Reddit and the livestreaming service Kick to its list of social media platforms that must prohibit children under 16 from having accounts.These platforms will join Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, and YouTube in facing a world-first legal obligation to shut down accounts belonging to younger Australian children on December 10, according to Communications Minister Anika Wells.","Denmark to introduce minimum age requirement of 15 on certain social media platforms.

Why the UAE deliberately sank 3 ships: Is it good for the ocean’s ecosystem?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/why-the-uae-deliberately-sank-3-ships-is-it-good-for-the-oceans-ecosystem/articleshow/125237316.cms,"Inchcape 1, sunk off Al Aqah in 2001, has transformed into a thriving marine habitat, attracting divers with its diverse marine life/ Image: vipdivingdubai





The Concept: Artificial reefs for marine life





Inchcape 1: A Diver’s haven in Al Aqah





Inchcape 2: A thriving Reef off Khor Fakkan





Inchcape 10: A marine wonderland in Fujairah





The Impact: Ecological balance and marine conservation

Khaleej Times





Why the UAE deliberately sank 3 ships: Is it bad for the ocIn a unique blend of environmental stewardship and ecotourism, the UAE has deliberately sunk three ships off its east coast, not as an accident, but as a conscious effort to promote marine conservation. The vessels, Inchcape 1, Inchcape 2, and Inchcape 10, have been transformed into thriving artificial reefs that now attract divers from across the world. This innovative approach is a testament to the UAE’s commitment to protecting its natural resources while fostering sustainable tourism.The concept behind sinking these ships is simple yet effective: to create artificial reefs that mimic the role of natural coral reefs in the ocean. Over time, the ships have become vibrant ecosystems, teeming with marine life. These reefs not only support a wide range of fish species but also help to promote biodiversity, offering an underwater experience for divers.The UAE’s efforts are especially significant given the rising threats to ocean ecosystems, including pollution and coral bleaching. The ships, once decommissioned, serve as a reminder that responsible management can help restore marine habitats.Sunk in 2001, Inchcape 1 lies about 32 meters below the surface, off the coast of Al Aqah, Fujairah. Accessible by boat in just five minutes from Al Aqah, this site is recommended for experienced divers, thanks to its depth and complexity. The wreck has turned into a bustling underwater city, home to large schools of red snapper, cardinal fish, and a wide variety of other marine creatures.Divers exploring the site can witness firsthand how the wreck has evolved into a rich marine habitat. Snorkelling and diving equipment are essential to access the site, and the area is becoming a popular spot for eco-tourists looking to experience the UAE’s commitment to sustainable diving.Inchcape 2, intentionally sunk in 2002, rests at a depth of around 22 meters off the coast of Khor Fakkan. It has quickly become one of the most popular dive sites in the region. As the wreck has developed into a thriving coral reef, it now attracts a variety of marine life, including parrotfish, moray eels, small boxfish, and long-tailed rays. The presence of barracudas also adds to the site's allure, making it a must-visit destination for professional divers seeking to explore a healthy and diverse underwater ecosystem.To visit, divers typically embark on a 25-minute boat ride from Al Aqah. Diving equipment is mandatory, and access is managed through licensed diving centers. These centers not only ensure safety but also educate visitors on how artificial reefs contribute to ocean health.Perhaps the most remarkable of the three, Inchcape 10 (formerly known as 'Awaiz') was sunk in 2003. Resting at a depth of about 23 meters off Fujairah, it is one of the largest ships deliberately sunk to create an artificial reef. This site has become a focal point for divers due to its rich biodiversity, including moray eels, barracudas, and other species.Located just an 8-minute boat ride from the Fujairah International Marine Club, the wreck offers an exciting opportunity to explore the wonders of marine life. The site is open year-round, and divers must book through licensed diving centers to gain access. Similar to the other wrecks, the presence of thriving marine life at Inchcape 10 speaks volumes about the success of the UAE’s ecotourism initiatives.Saleh Al-Dhahouri, a diver from Dibba Al Fujairah, has seen firsthand the positive transformation that these shipwrecks have brought to the area. “The diving there is wonderful, a beautiful place, and you couldn't get over the amount of fish and coral,” he said, as told to. He explained that before the ships were sunk, diving opportunities were limited. “With these ships, diving sites have increased, and they have become part of the weekly diving program,” he added, highlighting how these artificial reefs have revitalized local dive tourism.Emirati diver Mintaha Al Shehhi, who specializes in sharks, has been diving in the region for over three years. She praised the ecological balance at sites like Inchcape 2, where frequent sightings of sharks and turtles indicate a healthy environment. “Sharks do not choose random locations, and turtles only pass through when they feel secure and find natural abundance,” she said, emphasizing that the presence of these larger creatures is a sign of a thriving and balanced marine ecosystem.ean’s ecosystem?","The uae has deliberately sunk three ships off its east coast, not as an accident, but as a conscious effort to promote marine conservation.

"Viral Alert: Dubai's iconic Kunafa Bar creator drops a new golden, halwa-spiced Abu Dhabi Bar",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/viral-alert-dubais-iconic-kunafa-bar-creator-drops-a-new-golden-halwa-spiced-abu-dhabi-bar/articleshow/125222621.cms,"Viral Chef Nouel Catis brings Abu Dhabi a signature chocolate twist / Image Credit: @chefnouel

Meet the creator - Chef Nouel Catis

The new Abu Dhabi Chocolate

The Main Flavor: A harmonious blend of rich salted caramel and traditional halwa (a dense, sweet delicacy).

Emirati Spices: The filling is layered with complex flavors like cardamom and fragrant saffron, giving it instant warmth and depth.

Local Touches: It features authentic ingredients like creamy tahini and sweet date syrup. The chef even notes hints of Balaleet, the sweet and savory Emirati breakfast dish.

Final Touch: To ensure its capital-city status, the bar is lavishly topped with shimmering 24-karat gold flakes.

Where to get the Golden Bar

Exclusive Initial Location: The Abu Dhabi Chocolate bar is initially sold exclusively at Rain Cafe outlets across the UAE.

Wider Delivery: For the brand's other popular flavors (like the Dubai Chocolate), you can often find them available for order on local food delivery platforms like Careem and Talabat in both Dubai and Abu Dhabi.

Price check

Price Range: The Abu Dhabi Chocolate bar is priced at approximately Dh100 (roughly $27 USD) for a 200g bar.

Other Sna'ap Bars: For comparison, the original 90g Dubai Chocolate bars typically sell for around Dh38.

Getting the viral treat outside the UAE

Rely on Travelers: The most common way to get the bars abroad is through friends, family, or colleagues who are traveling from the UAE and can carry them back as a unique souvenir.

Third-Party Shipping Services: Some international fans resort to using re-shipping or concierge services based in the UAE. These services purchase the bar locally and then ship it internationally, though this adds significant cost and is not handled by the chocolate maker itself.

Check Pop-ups: Keep an eye on the official Sna'ap/Chef Nouel Catis social media channels. As the brand grows, they may announce international pop-up events or partnerships that temporarily make the bars available in other countries.

Dubai’s famous Pistachio Crunch

Pistachio-Tahini Cream: A smooth, creamy paste with a deep, nutty Middle Eastern flavor.

Crispy Kataifi: Finely shredded, toasted filo dough, which gives the bar an irresistible, signature crunch (inspired by the famous dessert Knafeh).
