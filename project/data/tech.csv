Instagram and small businesses: Visibility, trust and the new storefront

On a busy afternoon in Old Delhi’s Parathe Wali Gali, Darshit Singh held up his phone and did something unusual.He didn’t hype the food.He critiqued it.The reel — an “honest review” of a legacy eatery and Daulat ki Chaat — crossed 7.3 million views. Messages flooded in. Invitations followed. Cities called.That was 2024.Today, Singh calls himself India’s first “food deinfluencer”.Elsewhere, Santosh was boarding a late-night flight after wrapping up a full corporate workday.An IIT-Delhi alumnus by degree and a traveller by instinct, he refuses to choose between spreadsheets and sunsets.“I’m a traveller with a full-time job,” he says — a line that has now become his digital identity.Every month, a new state.Every trip, a vlog.Every journey, proof that passion doesn’t need permission.What once looked like just another viral reel is now part of something bigger — a creator economy projected to be worth thousands of crores, and increasingly recognised in India’s economic blueprint.This year’s Union Budget did something subtle but significant: it placed creativity inside the growth narrative.Welcome to India’s Orange Economy moment.For decades, art, storytelling and digital creation lived in the margins of economic planning — celebrated culturally, rarely counted financially.That is beginning to change.The “Orange Economy” — a term popularised by the Inter-American Development Bank refers to industries that transform ideas into cultural goods and services protected by intellectual property. It includes media, film, music, publishing, animation, gaming, advertising, design, fashion, digital content and now, increasingly, independent creators.In India’s Union Budget 2026–27, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced a major push for India’s creative industries — or what is increasingly being called the “Orange Economy.”Presenting the Budget, Sitharaman emphasised that India’s creative and AVGC-XR (Animation, Visual Effects, Gaming, Comics and Extended Reality) ecosystem has the potential to generate large-scale employment and position India as a global content hub.The Economic Survey projected that the AVGC sector alone could require up to 2 million skilled professionals by 2030.Sitharaman highlighted that India’s demographic dividend must be aligned with emerging sectors, particularly those driven by digital platforms and intellectual property.At the WAVES summit earlier this year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi reinforced this direction, describing India as a nation with “a billion-plus stories” and positioning the creative economy as both cultural capital and economic opportunity.India’s creator economy is projected to grow at an 18% compound annual growth rate, rising from Rs 19 billion in 2023 to Rs 34 billion by 2026, according to Ernst & Young.Influencer marketing is defined as “a collaboration between popular social-media users and brands to promote brands’ products or services.”What began as informal brand shoutouts has now evolved into a regulated, data-driven industry.The scale today is substantial. Globally, the influencer marketing economy was valued at $21.1 billion in 2023, having more than doubled since 2019 on the strength of platforms such as Instagram and YouTube.According to ET, the global influencer marketing platform market grew from $6 billion in 2020 to a projected $24.1 billion by 2025, at a CAGR of 32%.Forbes highlighted that the broader creator economy is now a $250 billion global force, projected by Goldman Sachs to reach $480 billion by 2027.Statista reports that over 200 million creators operate globally, while social commerce is expected to touch $2.9 trillion by 2026.India’s influencer marketing sector is projected to reach Rs 3,375 crore by 2026, growing at a CAGR of 18%, according to EY’s ‘State of Influencer Marketing in India’ report.Exchange4Media estimates the core influencer market at around Rs 3,600 crore in 2024, projected to reach Rs 4,500 crore in 2025, though insiders suggest the real size may exceed Rs 10,000 crore due to direct brand-creator deals outside conventional tracking.Creator fees rose between 10–30%, while top-tier creators in India reportedly earned between Rs 10–25 crore annually through endorsements, platform monetisation, live events and equity partnerships.Influencers are categorised by follower size:EY observes that marketers leverage both large/macro and micro/nano influencers equally.While mega and macro influencers drive awareness and brand loyalty, micro and nano influencers often deliver stronger engagement and relatability.Regional creators are becoming central to brand strategies. According to Influencer.in (Social Beat), regional creators drive 35–40% better engagement in Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities. Budget allocation for regional creators has increased from 3–10% earlier to 8–20%, with expectations of further growth.The ecosystem is increasingly youth-driven. A 2024 YouTube India–SmithGeiger report found that 83% of Indian Gen Zers consider themselves creators, and 75% see content creation as a genuine career path. More than 55% reported gaining financial independence through digital platforms.As ET highlights, influencer marketing is seen as cost-effective and personalised. Influencers build relatability and directly shape purchase decisions. In fact, 61% of consumers trust recommendations from creators more than traditional brand advertising, according to Sprout Social cited by Forbes.Influencer partnerships typically follow two models:Increasingly, creators are moving beyond endorsements to ownership — launching brands, seeking equity partnerships and building independent revenue streams. Exchange4Media notes a visible shift from “endorser to owner.”From hyper-local memers to pan-India gaming stars, from nano creators in Tier-3 cities to mega influencers earning crores annually, India’s influencer economy is no longer peripheral to marketing. It has become a structured, high-growth pillar of brand strategy — reshaping commerce, culture and consumer trust in the digital age.For creators like Darshit, having a mass following of 51.7K followers, the viral Old Delhi reel was only the beginning. What followed was a clearer understanding of how the influencer economy actually works.“I started making content post-COVID but it was mostly just pictures and a few videos with music. No voiceover,” he says. It was only after that breakout moment in 2024 that he began studying the platform more closely — especially the algorithm.“Instagram is fundamentally different… it thrives on recommendations,” he explains. Unlike platforms that depend heavily on follower count, Instagram pushes reels to users who may never have heard of the creator but are likely to engage. “Someone who has never made a video in their life can come to this platform and make one and get millions of views.”Uploading identical content across YouTube Shorts, Facebook and Threads, Singh says Instagram consistently delivers his highest reach. For him, discovery is not accidental — it is engineered.But growth alone was never the goal. His identity as a “food deinfluencer” is built on resisting what he sees as blind positivity in brand culture.“Our society today has a trust crisis. Be it government, institutions, or media. Everyone is facing that. So for me, my audience’s trust is paramount,” he says. Even in paid collaborations, he critiques dishes he does not like. “I wanna be the reason behind someone’s memorable meal.”His approach reflects a broader shift in marketing strategy. “Earlier brands used to only work with celebrities and movie stars but now they prefer influencers in most cases as the latter gives them higher ROI,” he observes. “Celebrities promoting a product feels like an ad. But some influencers subtly promote the brand in their organic way… audiences are more likely to purchase that product later.”A few kilometres away from Old Delhi’s food lanes, Santosh is planning his next trip — between client calls.Santosh began his creator journey not in airports or mountains but inside hostel rooms. What started as campus vlogs on YouTube, hostel stories, placement anxiety, the reality of being an IIT student slowly built a community of aspirants and peers.Then came Instagram.Reels allowed him to compress entire journeys into seconds — a new state every month, documented between office deadlines. The platform’s real-time engagement — stories, reels, DMs helped him move beyond informational content into something more personal.“You can be discovered without being famous,” he says, pointing to how a few of his travel and IIT reels travelled far beyond his existing follower base.More importantly, he has watched the industry change.“When I started, content creation felt experimental,” Santosh says. “Now brands plan structured budgets. Long-term collaborations. There’s more professionalism.”In his words, the creative economy is no longer informal hustle.It’s recognised work.If the orange economy is the ecosystem and creators are its lifeblood, then Instagram is the marketplace — the digital high street where attention turns into advertising, and creativity converts into commerce.To understand how influencer marketing thrives, it’s important to understand how Instagram itself makes money.Founded in 2010 by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger as a simple photo-sharing app, Instagram was built on one idea: visuals connect people. What started as a minimalist platform for filtered photos has evolved into a billion-user ecosystem of Stories, Reels, shopping tabs and creator tools.After Meta (then Facebook) acquired Instagram in 2012 for $1 billion, the platform scaled rapidly. Today, Instagram is estimated to be worth around $400 billion, making it one of the most valuable digital assets globally.The engine driving all of this? Advertising.Instagram’s primary revenue model is advertising. What makes Instagram powerful for marketers is its algorithmic precision. Content appears based on user behavior, engagement patterns and interests.The platform’s shift toward short-form video has supercharged engagement. According to a Meta-commissioned IPSOS study:Meta India’s Managing Director Arun Srinivas said: “India is leading the world in video adoption, and Reels is at the center of this shift. Five years since its launch, Reels is India’s leading short-form video platform—driving massive engagement, shaping culture, and delivering real business impact.”Instagram’s model is symbiotic with the influencer economy.While food reels dominate one corner of the ecosystem, knowledge-driven creators are building influence in quieter but equally powerful ways.For Bikramjeet Dutta, having a massive following of 51.9K followers, Instagram’s inflexion point came during the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. “I was attending several political rallies, press conferences etc. I started uploading that it started gaining views and followers,” he says.His content extends beyond political coverage into books, geopolitics and history. “Instagram helped me to connect with those who are experts in these fields,” he says, adding that credibility assessment feels more immediate on the platform. “In Instagram it's quite easy to verify whether the person is credible or not.”Discovery, he believes, has fundamentally shifted the opportunity landscape. Posting book reviews led to requests from publishers. Geopolitical commentary brought invitations to panel discussions and book launches. “Yes, Instagram has made it easier for creators to be discovered,” he says.For many small businesses in India, Instagram is no longer just a marketing add-on. It functions as a storefront, catalogue, customer service desk and storytelling space — often all at once.The shift became especially visible during the pandemic. In 2020, Instagram introduced the ‘Support Small Business’ sticker, which grouped Stories using the sticker into a shared feed so “more people can discover more small businesses.”Around the same time, it rolled out features that made it easier to discover gift cards, online food orders and fundraisers, allowing users to tap directly and purchase through partner websites.For Nidhi who runs a handmade chocolate business, Instagram became more than a display window.“Instagram didn’t just become a platform… it became the space where my creativity found its voice,” she says.She explains that unlike other platforms, Instagram allowed her “to connect, not just sell — to share stories, build trust, and grow a community that appreciates handmade details and thoughtful gifting.”Instead of simply listing prices, she moved toward behind-the-scenes reels — melting chocolate, assembling hampers, last-minute packing. The shift from static posts to process-driven video felt “more genuine for the audience.”Another small business owner Harsh in the fabric trade echoes a similar sentiment.“Instagram has played a major role in building our fabric brand identity. Through reels, product videos, and live customer interactions, we showcase our manufacturing quality, fabric textures, and latest collections in a very visual way.”Increased competition, he highlights, has pushed businesses “to become more creative by high-quality reels and by making it more realistic.”In the architecture of the orange economy, small businesses are not just beneficiaries of digital platforms. They are active participants: adapting content, tone and strategy in response to algorithmic culture and rising competition.",This year’s union budget did something subtle but significant: it placed creativity inside the growth narrative.

GalaxEye’s upcoming spacecraft will be folded into what the founder described as a “virtual constellation”, allowing Nsil to plug data gaps in its current offerings.“Nsil will resell our data. From now on, whatever satellites we launch, Nsil becomes a reseller for that data,” GalaxEye co-founder and CEO Suyash Singh told TOI.The first satellite — “Drishti” — in GalaxEye’s planned 10-satellite constellation is scheduled to leave for launch on Feb 25. The company plans to deploy all 10 spacecraft over the next four years. The current agreement is structured to cover the entire planned constellation, meaning Nsil can distribute data from each satellite as it comes online.In practical terms, Nsil will function as an extended sales arm for the start-up.It will be able to market raw data as well as downstream products built by GalaxEye. The arrangement also allows Nsil to directly sell the satellite data to its own customer base, which includes govt agencies and commercial clients.Drishti, which is expected to launch aboard a SpaceX mission, weighs 160-kg and is pegged to be India’s largest privately built commercial satellite. While GalaxEye, through contracts with Ananth Technologies and XDLINX procured the satellite bus, the firm said the spacecraft will carry its proprietary “SyncFused OptoSAR” technology, combining optical and synthetic aperture radar data on a single platform.About one cubic metre in size with a 3.5-metre deployable antenna, Drishti will offer 1.5-metre resolution imagery and a global revisit time of seven to ten days. The data is aimed at defence, border surveillance, disaster response, infrastructure monitoring, agriculture, and financial risk assessment.GalaxEye has completed around 500 aerial test flights and earlier flew a payload on Isro’s PSLV mission. The structural model was recently tested at Isro’s UR Rao Satellite Centre.The start-up is in discussions with Indian defence and agriculture ministries and has signed letters of intent with partners in over 20 countries. It plans to scale up its future satellites, targeting 0.5-metre resolution in future versions.“With recent geopolitical events increasing, we look forward to providing unparalleled imagery intelligence. We already have interest from defence and security agencies, utilities, agriculture, and financial companies and we are truly excited about the potential of this technology to transform decision-making and operational efficiency across industries,” Singh had earlier told TOI.","Bengaluru-based space start-up galaxeye has signed a channel partnership agreement with space psu newspace india limited (nsil) it is the first time the state-owned company has partnered with a domestic private player to distribute satellite data.

"India in 'box seat' in a fragmented world, says Martin Sorrell",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-in-box-seat-in-a-fragmented-world-says-martin-sorrell/articleshow/128324674.cms,"PM Modi Says India Pushes Reforms With Conviction, Not Compulsion; Poised To Drive Global Growth

NEW DELHI: India is in a ""superb position"" in a highly fragmented geopolitical world, as the fastest-growing economy with the scale, stability and technological ambition to help shape the next global order, Martin Sorrell, chairman of S4 Capital said on Friday.""So, India is in the box seat for two reasons. In that fragmented world, picking growth is really important. India is growing. The second thing is because growth is going to be more tempered because inflation is tougher to deal with than people think (and we see that with central banks), and interest rates, as a result, are going to be higher than we've been used to...""He said applying AI and blockchain becomes important. It is quite extraordinary that computing changes and capacity changes we are going to see not just from AI, but from implementation and quantum. India can play a huge role, he added. Responding to how India should be positioned, he said: ""India is in a superb position. It has leadership, it has a strategy built around not only manufacturing but tech as well, and it has structure to get things done. India was the fastest-growing country last year. It will be the fastest-growing country this year. It will be the fastest-growing next year. PM Modi has done an excellent job of leadership and representing Brand India.The PM should be the chief brand officer.""Commenting on the growing instability reshaping advertising and media strategy, Sorrell said, ""Volatility in economies is so huge that (long-term strategy) is under attack. AI is driving this... we're seeing a tremendous focus on short-term brand performance, on activation, and performance, and promotion."" He said wholesale adoption of AI at scale has not been seen except in two verticals - autos and financial services as there's economic pressure from outside.

Need to focus on value addition in food processing: Chirag Paswan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/need-to-focus-on-value-addition-in-food-processing-chirag-paswan/articleshow/128326537.cms,"NEW DELHI: India has the volume to support food security of many other countries, but the full potential of the food processing sector has not been tapped yet, food processing minister Chirag Paswan said on Friday, while emphasising the need to take this sector deeper into the rural India.Paswan said that in the food processing industry, India has volume, but now there is a need to focus on value addition. He said there are key challenges, including making farmers financially strong, which can happen only when they have holding capacity to sell their produce when they get a good price. The minister said this can happen when the shelf life of farm produce is enhanced by value addition. He added that there is a need to set up more food processing units close to agriculture production hubs. He also highlighted the need to address wastage, particularly of perishable products.He said several interventions, which govt has taken in the past decade, will help India to position itself as a global food basket. On India’s growth story, Paswan said a decade of structural reforms under PM Modi have strengthened the country’s economic resilience. Paswan said even amid global uncertainties, India remains the fastest-growing major economy.He added the country’s next leap will be powered not merely by scale, but by value creation particularly in agriculture and allied sectors. “Our agriculture sector is shifting from subsistence to value creation,” he said, underscoring the renewed focus on animal husbandry, fisheries, and food processing.On India-US deal, Paswansaid the interests of farmers will never be compromised. The assurance came as the Opposition raised questions over the deal, calling it ‘anti-farmer.” “India is one of the fastest-growing economies. That means we are doing something right. Our policies are often challenged, but we are allaying every fear.”","India has the volume to support food security of many other countries, chirag paswan says.

Spectrum can't be part of insolvency process: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/spectrum-cant-be-part-of-insolvency-process-sc/articleshow/128322830.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Friday held that telecom companies cannot claim ownership over spectrum allocated to them by govt and the natural resource cannot be subject to insolvency and liquidation process of a bankrupt telecom company.A bench of Justices P S Narasimha and A S Chandurkar rejected the plea of banks, which submitted that licenced spectrum could also be put on block to recover debt taken by a bankrupt telecom company. It quashed an NCLAT order in insolvency proceedings of Aircel group, which had said that spectrum usage rights could be treated as assets of a corporate debtor and could be transferred during insolvency or liquidation. The court's order is a setback to banks, which have exposure to telecom firms.""Recognition of spectrum licensing rights as an intangible asset in the balance sheet is not determinative of recognition/transfer of ownership of the spectrum to telecom service providers (TSPs). It only indicates control over the future economic benefits flowing from the grant of the right to use the spectrum. Hence, even if the right to use spectrum exhibits property-like features, such as longer licensing terms, exclusivity, transferability, tradability, etc, they merely represent different sticks in the bundle of rights and falls short of conferring complete ownership of the spectrum on TSPs,"" the bench said.Justice Narasimha, who penned the judgment, said merely because spectrum can be treated as an ""asset"" on the basis of certain attributes - such as possession and usage, lease and assignment, claim and liability or credit and debt - the entirety of the telecom sector cannot be brought under the sweep of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC).He said the grant of a telecom licence, including the right to use spectrum, does not effect a transfer of ownership or proprietary interest. ""What is conferred is a limited, conditional and revocable privilege to use spectrum for specified purposes and for a defined duration,"" the bench said.""In conclusion, the framework of IBC is clear in excluding assets over which the corporate debtor has no ownership rights. Mere recognition of spectrum licensing rights as an intangible asset by TSPs in financial statements is not conclusive of their ownership, as it only represents control over future economic benefits. Even assuming that licensing of spectrum rights is one among the bundle of rights, in the absence of transfer of title over the spectrum, no ownership rights are created in TSPs either in the spectrum or in its right to use as governed by licensing conditions. Hence, under the IBC framework, spectrum licensing right is not a part of the pool of assets for insolvency or liquidation,"" the judgment said.It said licence agreement leaves no doubt that effective and pervasive control over the licence and spectrum vests with the licensor (govt) and licensee's rights are circumscribed by regulatory oversight, disclosure obligations, restrictions on transfer, and the ever-present power of the licensor to suspend or terminate the licence for breach, liquidation, or winding up of the licensee.","Justices p s narasimha and a s chandurkar rejected the plea of banks.

Influencer Clavicular and the Arizona State University fashion show that sparked the framemogging trend

The phrase “Clavicular Framemogging” suddenly took over social media this week. People saw it, paused, and read it again. It sounded confusing. Some even thought it was a medical term. But it is not. It is an internet joke that grew very fast after a viral video from Arizona State University. The trend began when an influencer known as Clavicular appeared at a fashion show at Arizona State University, often called ASU. A short clip from the event started spreading online.In the video, Clavicular is seen standing beside a much larger fraternity member. Viewers quickly began using the phrase “Clavicular was brutally framemogged” to describe what they saw. Within hours, the phrase turned into memes, reaction posts, and debates across social media platforms. Many users were confused at first, then they joined in and that is how the trend exploded.To understand the moment, it helps to know who Clavicular is. He is a niche influencer connected to online looks-focused communities. His content talks about posture, bone structure, shoulder width, and facial balance. He often breaks down how physical proportions affect appearance.The word “mogging” comes from online slang. It means someone visually overpowers another person. “Framemogging” focuses only on body frame, not clothes or face. It is about shoulders, build, and overall outline.During the Arizona State University fashion show livestream, Clavicular was standing next to a fraternity member with a broader build. Viewers noticed the clear difference in size and frame. Soon after, clips were reposted with captions saying, “Clavicular got framemogged.”The irony made people react even more. Clavicular’s content often studies body structure. In this clip, viewers felt he was outmatched in the very area he talks about. That contrast is what made the phrase funny to many users.Another reason the trend grew so quickly is the name itself. “Clavicular Framemogging” sounds dramatic and complex. Internet culture often turns strange, very specific words into viral jokes. Once a few big meme pages shared it, the phrase spread widely.There is no official medical or scientific meaning behind it. It is simply internet slang born from a viral moment at Arizona State University. Still, the influencer’s fashion show debut gave the phrase a face, a setting, and a story. That helped it move from confusion to full trend in less than a day. In the end, the trend shows how fast online language changes. A short campus clip turned into a catchphrase that thousands of people repeated within hours.",The phrase “clavicular framemogging” suddenly took over social media this week.

Did Cardi B get back in contact with Offset after separating from Stefon Diggs?



What happened between Cardi B and Offset?



Stefon Diggs, the New England Patriots’ star player, and Cardi B have allegedly gone their separate ways on Sunday night.While the break up has not been confirmed yet, both Stefon Diggs and Cardi B have removed each other from their respective social media accounts. Amid all the mess, there has been a new speculation of Cardi B getting back together with her ex husband, Offset.A few hours ago, as Cardi B removed Stefon Diggs from her social media account, a rumor circulated on how she has started following Offset after blocking him last year.Cardi B and Offset’s fan accounts took to X to post alleged screenshots of the Grammy winner adding back Offset on her social media.However, all the screenshots of Cardi B allegedly adding Offset back on her social media are fake.At this point in time, Cardi B has not added back her ex husband, Offset, on her social media as she is keeping her complete focus on her new tour.Over the last few months, ever since Cardi B had announced her divorce from Offset, she has been public about the pain she has gone through in her marriage.Offset has also accepted making mistakes in his marriage to Cardi B.

Almost a year after JPMorgan made 5 days work from office compulsory and CEO Jamie Dimon said don't tell JPMorgan what to do at Townhall; some employees fear petition that they call ‘career ...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/almost-a-year-after-jpmorgan-made-5-days-work-from-office-compulsory-and-ceo-jamie-dimon-said-dont-tell-jpmorgan-what-to-do-at-townhall-some-employees-fear-petition-that-they-call-career-suicide/articleshow/128211254.cms,"When Jamie Dimon's angry outburst at Townhall went viral

In March 2026, it will be a year since America's biggest bank made 5-day work from office compulsory. The largest US bank, which employs more than 300,000 people globally, told all of its employees to return to the office five days a week starting in March, ending a hybrid work-from-home policy that took effect during the pandemic. Just days after CEO Jamie Dimon's order to all employees to come into the office five days a week, a petition surfaced. The petition, which was part of complaints over JP Morgan's call to bring employees back to office 5 days a week, asked CEO Dimon to reverse the change. The petition that continues to be live online is addressed to chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. In the petition, employees have complained about losing hybrid working arrangements. ""Some employees sought advice from the Communications Workers of America on how they might set up a labor union, a rare thing in the US finance sector.And now a year since the petition was set up, it has about 2,000 signatories out of the Bank's more than 300,000 global employees. According to a report in Financial Times, there are some who believe that signing the petition will be a ‘career suicide’. The report details internal backlash to the 5-day mandate.As per the report, employees at the America's largest lender told the Financial Times they were bewildered by management’s insistence on a full-time return to company offices, though teams are scattered across the globe. “My team is spread out through two continents and three time zones,” said a JPMorgan employee who signed a petition to bring back hybrid work. “JPMorgan is a global company — why can’t that include my home office?” “Hybrid is working and employees love the happy medium,” the staffer told the FT. ""We, the workers of JPMorganChase (JPMC), are concerned about the future of our workplace - its integrity, employee satisfaction, and the increasing toxicity that has metastasized in our company culture in the last couple of months,"" reads the petition.Dimon announced the five-day return to office policy on January 10, 2025, ahead of a March 2025 start date. Soon after announcing the change, Dimon went viral for angry outburst he had about the employee petition during a Town Hall meeting. When asked about the in-person work policy during the staff meeting, he said, ""Don't waste time on it. I don't care how many people sign that fucking petition,"" he said, drawing some laughter. Instead, Dimon demanded more efficiency and stressed employees have a choice whether to work at JPMorgan. The CEO told them not to be mad at him, and said it was a free country.Dimon, who has run the lender for 19 years, said some staff did not pay attention during Zoom meetings, which reduced their efficiency and creativity. In-office requirements will not be left up to managers, Dimon said. ""There is no chance that I will leave it up to managers,"" he said. ""Zero chance. The abuse that took place is extraordinary.""In an interview to CNBC, Dimon said, that he respects employees who don't want to come into the office five days a week, but said the policy will not change because it is best for clients and the company. ""I am not against working from home, I am against where it doesn't work,"" he said, adding that 10% of the bank's jobs are done remotely.Later in the year, in an interview to Bloomberg, Dimon said that he also understands the appeal of logging in from home; remote work can pan out well for some companies and certain roles. Talking about his angry response to a question on work from home, he said, “I gave a very detailed answer about why [work from home] doesn’t work for young people, why it doesn’t work for management, why it doesn’t work for innovation,” Dimon said. “I completely applaud your right to not want to go to the office every day. But you’re not going to tell JPMorgan what to do.”","Jpmorgan ceo jamie dimon ordered all employees to return to the office five days a week starting in march 2025.

Maharashtra pharmacy distributor loses Rs 6.7 crore in 6 months in stock investment app scam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolhapur/karad-pharmacy-distributor-loses-rs-6-7-crore-over-6-months-in-stock-investment-app-scam/articleshow/128271917.cms,"



KOLHAPUR: A 52-year-old wholesale pharmacy distributor from Karad lost Rs 6.7 crore to cybercriminals who promised shares and stocks at discounted rates and high returns on investments over the past six months, the police said.The alleged scam started with a WhatsApp message from an unknown person to Ajay Bhattad, the pharmacy distributor, asking him to download an app and make investments.On Sept 9, 2025, Ajay Bhattad, a pharma distributor and resident of Shaniwar Peth in Satara's Karad town, had gone to Jaysingpur in Kolhapur to meet his relative. While he was at his relative's place, he received a WhatsApp message with a link and voice calls from two numbers telling him about a share market investment plan. They told Bhattad to download a mobile application named SIG to get shares and stocks at a discounted price, and promised high returns on subsequent liquidation of shares.""Initially, the victim got some returns. He went on to buy the shares and invest. They trapped him in their scam in such a way that he was buying the shares as recently as the first week of Feb. During verification, we found that the money was transferred through RTGS mode to 30 different accounts of both private and public banks, mostly with branches outside Maharashtra.The website floated by the scamsters is deceiving, and makes claims such as huge profits of Rs 333 crore being made to some investors,"" said Amol Thakur, the sub-divisional police officer of Jaysingpur division, who superintendent of police Yogeshkumar Gupta appointed for a thorough investigation.Gupta deputed some staff from the cyber police station to work under Thakur to get to the bottom of the scam. ""It is an organised crime. We are reaching out to the banks so that we can stop further transfer of the invested funds to the mule accounts,"" said the investigation officer.A case was registered against the unknown people operating the SIG mobile app and the people associated with the two phone numbers through which the communication was made, under sections 318(4), 316(2), 3(5) of BNS 2023 and 66(D) of the Indian IT Act 2000.","The alleged scam started with a whatsapp message from an unknown person to ajay bhattad, the pharmacy distributor.

A survey conducted by BASIC Home Loan shows that the average age of applicants has dropped to 25, a steep fall from 35 and above seen only a few years back. The change comes as more and more Gen Z buyers are participating in decisions around purchasing homes.The balance of demand has firmly tilted towards younger cohorts. Millennials, those born from 1981 to 1996, along with Gen Z, born between 1997 and 2012, now dominate the market and together contribute nearly 90–95% of residential acquisitions, ET said, citing the report.The shift can be attributed to technology. Almost 72% of borrowers below the age of 40 prefer to submit their loan applications online.Comfort with online processes is no longer limited to the young. Adoption among senior citizens is rising too, with close to 47% of borrowers above 60 saying they are now at ease applying for loans through digital channels.“Over the past few decades, the Indian housing finance sector has undergone a transformation. What was once a fragmented and largely inaccessible ecosystem dominated by high interest rates and informal lending has matured into one of the most dynamic pillars of the country's financial system,” Atul Monga, CEO and co-founder, BASIC Home Loan said, as quoted by the financial daily.Industry numbers mirror the expansion in participation. The country’s home loan market stood at $329.9 billion in 2024 and is forecast to expand at a compound annual rate of 8.9% from 2025 to 2033. According to the National Housing Bank, individual housing credit registered a 14% year-on-year rise, touching Rs 33.53 lakh crore in the second quarter of FY24.Public sector banks remain the biggest players, holding more than 44% of outstanding individual housing loans during the period. Private lenders have built up a 36% share, growing quickly on the back of digital offerings and faster processing.Meanwhile, non-banking financial companies are carving out space, particularly among customers aged over 40 who value flexible lending frameworks and speedier disbursals.Borrowers, however, continue to face friction in the process. As many as 44% pointed to heavy documentation as the main barrier, while 32% flagged mis-selling by agents. Another 17% said long approval timelines slowed their path to securing a loan.The survey gathered insights from more than 7,400 present and prospective homebuyers across Tier-2 and Tier-3 locations, underlining how improved access to finance, wider digital reach and changing expectations are drawing more people into formal housing finance.","The balance of demand has firmly tilted towards younger cohorts.

Canada, Greenland Show Of Power Amid Trump's ‘Invasion’ Storm; 'Difficult Times Are...'





The makers of mobile apps designed to help shoppers identify and boycott American goods say they saw a surge of interest in Denmark and beyond after the recent flare-up in tensions over U.S. President Donald Trump's designs on Greenland.The creator of the ""Made O'Meter"" app, Ian Rosenfeldt, said he saw around 30,000 downloads of the free app in just three days at the height of the trans-Atlantic diplomatic crisis in late January out of more than 100,000 since it was launched in March.Apps offer practical help Rosenfeldt, who lives in Copenhagen and works in digital marketing, decided to create the app a year ago after joining a Facebook group of like-minded Danes hoping to boycott U.S. goods.""Many people were frustrated and thinking, 'How do we actually do this in practical terms,'"" the 53-year-old recalled. ""If you use a bar code scanner, it's difficult to see if a product is actually American or not, if it's Danish or not. And if you don't know that, you can't really make a conscious choice.""The latest version of ""Made O'Meter"" uses artificial intelligence to identify and analyze several products at a time, then recommend similar European-made alternatives.Users can set preferences, like ""No USA-owned brands"" or ""Only EU-based brands."" The app claims over 95% accuracy.""By using artificial intelligence, you can take an image of a product ... and it can make a deep dive to go out and find the correct information about the product in many levels,"" Rosenfeldt told The Associated Press during a demonstration at a Copenhagen grocery store. ""This way, you have information that you can use to take decisions on what you think is right.""'Losing an ally' After an initial surge of downloads when the app was launched, usage tailed off. Until last month, when Trump stepped up his rhetoric about the need for the U.S. to acquire Greenland, a strategically important and mineral-rich Arctic island that is a semiautonomous territory of Denmark.Usage peaked Jan. 23, when there were almost 40,000 scans in one day, compared with 500 or so daily last summer. It has dropped back since but there were still around 5,000 a day this week, said Rosenfeldt, who noted ""Made O'Meter"" is used by over 20,000 people in Denmark but also by people in Germany, Spain, Italy, even Venezuela.""It's become much more personal,"" said Rosenfeldt, who spoke of ""losing an ally and a friend.""Trump announced in January he would slap new tariffs on Denmark and seven other European countries that opposed his takeover calls, only to abruptly drop his threats after he said a ""framework"" for a deal over access to mineral-rich Greenland was reached with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte's help. Few details of that agreement have emerged.The U.S. began technical talks in late January to put together an Arctic security deal with Denmark and Greenland, which say sovereignty is not negotiable.Rosenfeldt knows such boycotts won't damage the U.S. economy, but hopes to send a message to supermarkets and encourage greater reliance on European producers.""Maybe we can send a signal and people will listen and we can make a change,"" he added.The protest may be largely symbolic Another Danish app, ""NonUSA,"" topped 100,000 downloads at the beginning of February. One of its creators, 21-year-old Jonas Pipper, said there were over 25,000 downloads Jan. 21, when 526 product scans were performed in a minute at one point. Of the users, some 46,000 are in Denmark and around 10,000 in Germany.""We noticed some users saying they felt like a little bit of the pressure was lifted off them,"" Pipper said. ""They feel like they kind of gained the power back in this situation.""It's questionable whether such apps will have much practical effect.Christina Gravert, an associate professor of economics at the University of Copenhagen, said there are actually few U.S. products on Danish grocery store shelves, ""around 1 to 3%"". Nuts, wines and candy, for example. But there is widespread use of American technology in Denmark, from Apple iPhones to Microsoft Office tools.""If you really want to have an impact, that's where you should start,"" she said.Even ""Made O'Meter"" and ""NonUSA"" are downloaded from Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store.Gravert, who specializes in behavioral economics, said such boycott campaigns are usually short-lived and real change often requires an organized effort rather than individual consumers.""It can be interesting for big supermarket brands to say, OK, we're not going to carry these products anymore because consumers don't want to buy them,"" she said. ""If you think about large companies, this might have some type of impact on the import (they) do.""On a recent morning, shoppers leaving one Copenhagen grocery store were divided.""We do boycott, but we don't know all the American goods. So, it's mostly the well-known trademarks,"" said Morten Nielsen, 68, a retired navy officer. ""It's a personal feeling ... we feel we do something, I know we are not doing very much.""""I love America, I love traveling in America,"" said 63-year-old retiree Charlotte Fuglsang. ""I don't think we should protest that way.""","""made o'meter"" uses artificial intelligence to identify and analyze several products at a time. Users can set preferences, like ""no usa-owned brands"" or ""only eu-based brands"" another danish app, ""nonusa,"" topped 100,000 downloads at the beginning of february.

Industry operations exposed

Supply chain mechanics

Failed crackdowns





A man, while surfing his regular channel for adult content, found himself on the website. On screen, he saw the quality time he had spent with his girlfriend in a hotel in China's Shenzhen three weeks ago.This incident sparked an investigation into China's spy-cam porn industry, exposing how the genre, heavily fueled by the voyeuristic audience, has been operating a sophisticated network of hidden cameras, livestreams, and paid subscriptions that exploit hotel guests nationwide.A report by BBC World Service found evidence of a structured industry involving multiple actors, including installers, “camera owners”, agents, and online distributors. The content is promoted on Telegram, a channel banned in China, while higher-level operators reportedly manage camera installations and streaming infrastructure.One of the Telegram channels, managed by an agent named 'AKA' had up to 10,000 members and was promoting access to over 180 hotel-room spy-cams livestreaming intimate moments to paying consumers for fees of around 450 Yuan monthly.Subscribers were able to select from multiple feeds, which are triggered immediately after the hotel guests put their key cards in.The website also had the options to rewind footage, download clips from the archives and a chatroom.In a period of seven months, 54 cameras were identified (half active), potentially capturing thousands of unaware guests based on occupancy rates.Operators install miniature hidden cameras, sometimes as small as a pencil eraser, inside hotel fixtures such as ventilation units, wiring them directly into the building’s power supply. The agents operate as intermediaries for “camera owners”, who are believed to oversee both the physical installation of devices and the running of the online platforms.Platform archives examined in the probe contained more than 6,000 edited clips dating back to 2017, and when one camera in a Zhengzhou hotel was discovered and removed, a replacement feed was activated within hours.Although regulations introduced in April 2025 require hotels to conduct routine inspections for hidden cameras, investigators were still able to identify thousands of newly uploaded videos on six different platforms over an 18‑month period.Law enforcement cases appear scattered across multiple provinces, but experts say the sustained demand for “raw”, non-consensual footage continues to drive the market, and tests show that many commercially available camera detectors fail to identify professionally concealed devices.","Investigation into china's spy-cam porn industry exposes sophisticated network of hidden cameras, livestreams, and paid subscriptions. 54 cameras were identified (half active), potentially capturing thousands of unaware guests based on occupancy rates.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128024592,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1235780,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Dubai is taking a major leap toward next-generation mobility with the imminent launch of fully autonomous ride-hailing services in the city through a high-profile partnership between Baidu’s Apollo Go autonomous vehicle platform and Uber . This cutting-edge mobility option, supported by the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), is set to begin operations in Dubai’s Jumeirah area soon, making it one of the world’s first cities to offer robotaxi rides at scale via a mainstream app.The deal brings Baidu’s Apollo Go autonomous ride-hailing service to the Uber platform, allowing passengers in Dubai to book driverless vehicles much like normal Uber rides. Riders will use the familiar Uber app to request a self-driving trip by selecting an “Autonomous” option or by booking through UberX or Uber Comfort and being matched with an Apollo Go vehicle.This operational rollout represents a new phase of autonomous mobility: the vehicles are expected to be fully self-driving, without a human safety driver, once initial deployment is complete and regulatory approval is finalised.Baidu’s Apollo Go has already laid the groundwork well before this launch. In late 2025, it received Dubai’s first fully driverless testing permit from the RTA and ran open-road trials with its fleet. This licence marked the first time a company was authorised to conduct fully unmanned autonomous vehicle operations in the city.Dubai also inaugurated a dedicated autonomous vehicle operations centre, Apollo Go’s first outside China, to support testing, maintenance, safety systems and fleet control.The plan is to scale the service over time, with aspirations to expand the autonomous fleet to more than 1,000 vehicles in the coming years as part of the city’s broader transport vision.Dubai’s new service launch is not just about novelty, it is part of a strategic effort to modernise transport infrastructure and create a smarter, safer, more efficient urban mobility ecosystem -This deploy­ment marks a high-visibility example of how cities can embrace artificial intelligence, sensors, advanced decision-making systems and smart infrastructure to improve everyday mobility for residents and visitors.Initially, autonomous vehicles will be available in key zones like the Jumeirah area, with service coverage expanding as data from early operations and regulatory frameworks evolve. Over time, the project is expected to become more seamless, with autonomous vehicles operating across broader urban areas.Passengers will enjoy:The autonomous ride-hailing launch follows years of groundwork, including pilot projects with safety drivers and other autonomous vehicle initiatives. Dubai is not alone in piloting such services as variations of robotaxis are being tested in many leading high-tech cities but integrating them into a mainstream ride-hailing platform at this level makes Dubai a global leader in real-world autonomous deployment.The initiative also builds on wider UAE advancements, including plans for other autonomous services and smart city innovations that are positioning the Emirates as a global hub for future mobility and tech commercialisation.Despite the enthusiasm, autonomous ride-hailing still faces hurdles -The arrival of Apollo Go autonomous ride-hailing in Dubai via Uber is a major milestone in the evolution of urban transportation, combining AI-driven vehicles, strategic government support and world-class infrastructure. As this service transitions from pilot to public rollout in 2026, it could redefine how people move through the city, reduce reliance on traditional drivers, and advance Dubai’s smart city aspirations into tangible reality.",Dubai's robotaxis are here as baidu and uber technologies collaborate with roads and transport authority: are you ready to ride with ai? What’s happening: apollo go meets uber in dubai. Driverless pickup and drop-off booked through the uber app. Potentially lower congestion and emissions.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128257133,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-51666,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Saudi Aramco, the world’s largest integrated energy and chemicals company, has announced a major breakthrough in its In-Kingdom Total Value Add (iktva) programme by achieving a 70% local content benchmark in its supply chain, a milestone that underscores the Kingdom’s push to build domestic industrial capacity and diversify its economy. This achievement comes as a part of a long-term strategy tied to Saudi Vision 2030 and has already delivered substantial economic benefits, including significant job creation and foreign investment.Launched in 2015, the iktva programme aims to maximise economic value within Saudi Arabia by localising procurement of goods and services, developing local suppliers and fostering a competitive national industrial ecosystem. Through the initiative, Aramco encourages global investors and manufacturers to establish operations in the Kingdom, boosting domestic production and supporting broader economic diversification efforts.Reaching a 70% local content rate means that most of Aramco’s procurement spending now remains in-Kingdom, a massive shift from earlier years when the majority of materials and services were imported. This localisation strengthens Saudi Arabia’s supply-chain resilience, mitigates exposure to global disruptions, and builds a robust industrial base capable of supporting both energy and non-energy sectors.The company has also reaffirmed its plan to raise local content further to 75% by 2030, signalling continued investment in national capabilities and competitiveness.Perhaps the most tangible effect of Aramco’s iktva success has been employment and economic expansion across Saudi Arabia:These outcomes show how iktva has not only tightened linkages between local suppliers and Saudi Aramco’s global operations but has also created a multiplier effect through job creation, skills development and supplier capability upgrades.Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 sees the energy sector as a springboard for broader economic transformation. Localising Aramco’s procurement spending aligns with that vision by nurturing local manufacturing, boosting exports, and reducing dependence on foreign supply chains.By concentrating procurement within the Kingdom, the programme incentivises suppliers to upgrade capacity and quality, which enhances Saudi Arabia’s industrial competitiveness. This involves identifying opportunities across diverse sectors, from chemicals and metals to services, electrical components and machinery, laying the foundation for future export growth.Recent decades have seen global supply chains disrupted by geopolitical events, pandemics and inflationary pressures. Localising a significant portion of Aramco’s procurement through iktva reduces external risk exposure, ensuring critical energy infrastructure is supported by a strengthened domestic ecosystem.Part of the iktva strategy has involved teaming up with private and public partners to broaden workforce training. Historical data from company initiatives shows that Aramco has collaborated with stakeholders to establish national training centres, equipping thousands of Saudi workers with marketable skills, a cornerstone of broader workforce localisation efforts.Though not included in the latest release, previous iktva forums and events highlighted how these training and certification initiatives help Saudis enter technical, management and advanced manufacturing roles, aligning human capital development with local industry needs.Aramco’s localisation drive is not just inward-facing. Through iktva, the company has hosted regional supplier forums, drawing global investors, manufacturers and service providers. These events help integrate Saudi Arabia into global supply networks and expand opportunities for both local and international firms seeking to contribute to and benefit from the Kingdom’s growth trajectory.This strategy also supports export capabilities, enabling products manufactured in Saudi Arabia to reach international markets as local suppliers mature and scale capacity.Saudi Aramco’s achievement of the 70% localisation benchmark is a pivotal step toward its 2030 target of 75% local content, reflecting sustained progress over more than a decade of strategic efforts. Automotive, petrochemical, electrical and industrial products made locally enhance the Kingdom’s economic stack, while new jobs strengthen the domestic labour market.By converting procurement spending into economic multipliers, the programme is seen as one of the most effective supply-chain-led industrial transformation models globally, melding energy-sector leadership with broader economic diversification. Saudi Arabia’s localisation milestones under iktva are significant not just for Aramco but for the Kingdom’s long-term economic resilience.As the global energy landscape evolves and diversification becomes imperative, the ability to develop local industries, create jobs and attract investment positions Saudi Arabia for a future where domestic capability matters as much as hydrocarbon wealth. This milestone reinforces the dual mission of strengthening national supply chains and supporting economic breadth, a key pillar of Vision 2030’s promise to transform Saudi Arabia into a thriving, diversified global economy.","Saudi aramco achieves 70% local content milestone in supply chain, boosting saudi vision 2030.
