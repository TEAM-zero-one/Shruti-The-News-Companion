"‘Journalism is first draft of history, Wikipedia second’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/journalism-is-first-draft-of-history-wikipedia-second/articleshow/128662426.cms,"For centuries, humanity has found itself caught between the promise of tomorrow and its perils when talking about the future. Socrates died a worried man because he thought writing will kill the quest for knowledge. It’s the same now with AI. How do you see this?

Broadly speaking, internet has made information a ‘commodity’. Do you think AI will make intelligence a commodity?

.

Wiki powered a huge number of Google search answers and is now emerging as a source layer for AI. Are LLMs both a threat and an opportunity to Wiki’s future?

■

You’re making the case really for human moderation of information.

Do you think that is where eventually the biggest problem with AI-curated information will lie, a wall that it cannot breach?

Like Google search in the past, AI companies have a frenemy relationship with news media — New York Times has sued OpenAI, for example. If AI systems increasingly cite original sources, should they be required to link back and share revenue or traffic?

.

How do we solve that?

Wikipedia has had this debate between deletionists and inclusionists. Which side are you on?

Tell us about your India community and volunteer group. There’s a perception or misperception, you tell us, that India pages are not as rigorous.

When people say, ‘Wikipedia is broken because it’s biased’, how do you react to that? And what’s your take on an AI-first competitor like Grokipedia?

How important is tone neutrality for credibility?

■

You launched WikiTribune to address neutrality in public discourse. Why did you not continue?

AI is fast changing the way information is created and shared, but speed and scale don’t necessarily mean credibility. Jimmy Wales , who co-founded Wikipedia — harnessing the wisdom of the crowd to upend traditional encyclopaedias like Britannica and become the internet’s default reference point — now finds it at the centre of a new debate on trust, including attacks from Elon Musk over alleged bias. Speaking to Rohit Saran and Saikat Dasgupta on the sidelines of the AI Impact Summit in Delhi, Wales reflects on the opportunities and risks AI presents, why neutrality is non-negotiable, and why trust is more important than ever■ John Philip Sousa (one of US’s most celebrated composers) believed people wouldn’t sing anymore when music began to be recorded. Chess, as a game, is more popular than ever before, even though the best chess player in the world is no longer human. It hasn’t stopped people from saying, ‘Oh, but we really enjoy playing chess!’ About AI, since the technology is so new, and so accessible, I don’t know. You ask a computer a question and it can answer, that’s incredible. But we also know it’s flawed. And then, there is this wild conjecture that it’s going to destroy all jobs, or no one will need to work anymore because we’re going to become vastly wealthy. Probably the answer, as ever, is somewhere in the middle.AI is obviously going to have a huge impact. What it will be is so hard to predict right now.■ All I can say is that right now, when we look at large language models — and I use them a lot, I’m a programmer, but not a very good one because I enjoy making things — it’s incredibly helpful and very fun. But it also makes things up and hallucinates. What I’m most interested in right now is, are there ways we can use this technology to support the community? Are there things that I can do pretty well? A lot of Wikipedia discussions are really long. You can get AI to summarise it. But here’s a key point, I want to read the original. It’s very useful. Another example would be you load up the Wikipedia article and all the sources and ask if there’s anything in the sources that should be on Wikipedia, but isn’t, or is there anything that’s not supported by sources. I did this and I think it is potentially useful for the community. Then say I want to write about a Bollywood movie that’s not globally famous in Wikipedia and I want to just get some basic facts about it. But I can’t read Hindi. Maybe the AI could help me a bit.We’re really about that human element, the human curated knowledge, the judgement. That machine translation might be a grammatical translation, but if you think about the cultural context of the reader, what they need to understand, what they are likely to know and what you need to explain to them, that goes beyond just the text. My example is, who’s the most famous cricket player? Today, it could be Virat Kohli in India. But if you’re writing for a global audience, you need to add a little text to explain who he is and put it in context. Machine translation can’t do that. But a human can.■ So, Gary Marcus is an AI researcher who has become known as kind of an AI sceptic, although I would say he’s not really an AI sceptic, but thinks that large language models have already hit a sort of wall — that we’re not seeing improvement on a lot of key issues like hallucinations. He thinks there needs to be some more fundamental breakthroughs. For some time, scaling seemed to make all the difference. But there are other experts of equal fame who disagree with them. Just watching that, I think, maybe we’re going to have a little bit of a break for a few years until there’s more breakthroughs where it’s like ‘okay, we’ve got this amazing tool but maybe we’re not that close to the next steps’.■ I think we’re going to have a big fight on copyrights. It’s going to be across legislatures and courts, rethinking how copyright law is structured. My concern is, we want to be careful about overreach. One of the classic principles of copyright law has always been that you can’t copyright facts. Some scientific publishers may be very excited to be able to say, you can’t use the facts unless you pay. And that’s a disaster. We don’t want to go there. That damages Wikipedia and our ability to say that on this date, this happened. Here’s the sources, and it’s five different newspapers. Also, newspapers don’t want to go there. One of the bigger, deeper issues is that local journalism has been wrecked. And that happened long before AI. For society, that’s a huge problem. I’m from Huntsville, Alabama, which is not a huge city, but it’s not tiny — 250,000 people. When I was a kid, I was a paper boy. I rode my bike and threw the papers (into houses). As a Wikipedian, the value of this is if I want to write about the history of Huntsville or the 1978 mayoral election, I’ve got a lot of good content to work with. But if I want to write about the most recent election? Very thin content. Because there’s just one afternoon paper now that’s published three times a week and from 100 miles away. And that means the first draft of history, which is journalism, isn’t being written. So, the second draft of history, which is Wikipedia, becomes much harder.■ I wish I had the answer to that. In some cases, maybe AI can help, if there’s some way to make it possible for one or two journalists to do more in a useful way that could be good. The changes in the information ecosystem have a lot of positives, obviously, but also some negatives. So go ahead and test.■ It has helped strengthen Wikipedia that we have this active, intellectual dialogue. I always say that I’m an eventualist, which is, we’ll probably get it wrong a lot but we’ll get it right eventually. The health of the Wikipedia community is important for us. Is the community having active discussions, having fun, behaving well? Are we doing things in a thoughtful way? I’m very comfortable with the debates as long as they don’t just become angry screaming matches.■ I find the Indian Wikipedia community to be very similar to everywhere in the world. A lot of nerds, not necessarily professionals in this field. There’s this guy in the global community with the nickname Hurricane Hank, who is a weather expert but not a professional meteorologist. The community has more men than women, unfortunately. That’s always something that we talk about. We want to improve that around the world. This is my third trip to India in a month and a half. On one of the trips, I was in Kerala, and I met with the local Wikipedia group. Among them was a couple, both Wikipedia editors, who brought their kids. On the second part of your question, I’ve not heard that about India pages. I do think it would be likely for the smaller language versions of Wikipedia. Obviously, those pages are typically going to be shorter and less filled in and less rigorous because there are fewer people doing it.■ See, Wikipedia is a source of knowledge, and sources are transparent things. One of the things that Elon (Musk) said is that Wikipedia just reflects mainstream propaganda. And I’m like, that’s really weird. Wikipedia reflects what reliable sources say. We cannot take one strange side, and say, ‘uh, we’re going to fight against all of scientific wisdom’, right? But we should reflect a debate if it’s a legitimate debate. Do we have biases? Well, of course, we’re human beings. So, we have to be really careful about that. Being neutral is one of the core values in the community. There’s no dispute about that. But do we always get it right? Maybe not. An old saying that I love is if you ask a fish about water, the fish will say, ‘What water?’ They live in it. They have no idea about it. And so oftentimes our biases are just there because we don’t know.Amartya Sen makes a comment in the introduction of his book, ‘10 Indians, 12 opinions’. That’s actually all humans — 10 humans, 12 opinions. Tone neutrality is very important for Wikipedia and for newspapers as well. I live in London and read two papers, Guardian and Telegraph. Guardian is a sort of centre left, Telegraph centre right. Both quality newspapers. I have an electric car, not a Tesla. I love electric cars and so I read a lot about them. If you cut out the headlines from those two papers, I can probably filter the information 90% accurately, because Guardian loves electric cars and Telegraph hates them. But because of this tone, I also trust both of them less because it feels like they are both campaigning. That’s a problem because it can reduce trust, not just with people who disagree, but even with people who agree with the tone.■ Tribune was an experiment to see if there was a way for journalists and community members to collaborate. What journalists can do, like you have come here in the middle of Delhi to chat with me, or go and report on something, or attend a press conference, or talk to a politician, that’s almost impossible to do as a volunteer. So, we explored some good collaborations. And then we would look at traffic stats every day. We had one story that had a really clickbait headline that I didn’t like. To make this into a commercial success, we needed more clickbait headlines. I didn’t want to do that. That’s how I realised the problem is not with journalism but that model, the broader ecosystem. The newspapers always love a good, juicy headline. There’s nothing wrong with that. But if algorithms are feeding people content to keep them around as long as possible, then that encourages more of the same kind of behaviour and so on. So it kind of changed my focus and was like, ok, good experiment.","Jimmy wales co-founded wikipedia, the internet’s default reference point.

Beyond Oil: How India & US Are Securing the Future of AI Chips

Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Saturday emphasised the importance of self-reliance in India’s technological future, stating that “Developed India will be built only when India is self-reliant. For this, Made in India chip is very important.”Addressing the virtual ceremony to lay the foundation stone of India Chip Pvt Ltd — a joint venture between the HCL Group and Foxconn — PM Modi noted that the global shortage of semiconductor chips during the Covid-19 pandemic had disrupted economies and halted production in factories worldwide.“Whatever India is doing in the field of technology in this decade, it will become foundation of our capability in the 21st century, the Prime Minister added.Prime Minister Narendra Modi highlighted India’s growing semiconductor ambitions, noting that ""India has so far approved 10 semiconductor fabrication and packaging projects under its Semiconductor Mission,"" adding that ""four of these units are set to commence production very soon.""The PM also welcomed the entry of major companies into India’s chip manufacturing sector, emphasising the need for self-reliance.He called for ""atmanirbharta"" in the process, underlining the goal of strengthening India's leadership in the global market.""Today, the arrival of major companies like Foxconn in India and their collaboration in chip manufacturing also sends a global message. A democratic country like India is a trusted partner for the world. Therefore, India's recognition as the world's factory is a win-win situation for both India and other countries,"" PM Modi said.The new Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly & Test (OSAT) facility will be located in the Yamuna Expressway Industrial Development Authority (YEIDA) area at Jewar, Greater Noida. The 60:40 joint venture between HCL Group and Foxconn represents an investment of Rs 3,700 crore, with operations expected to commence by 2028. The plant will manufacture display driver chips, supporting India’s growing domestic demand for semiconductor components.According to PTI, the project is expected to generate more than 3,500 direct and indirect jobs, foster local supply chains, and attract partners across the semiconductor ecosystem. The facility is designed to process up to 20,000 wafers per month, strengthening a resilient and self-reliant chip supply chain in India.“In the last 11 years, the Prime Minister has established India as powerhouse of electronics manufacturing. India is now ranked third among nations that export electronics. In a month, 3.6 crore chips will be produced from this plant. The brain of the digital screens that you see will now be made in Jewar,” said Union electronics and IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw.UP chief minister Yogi Adityanath described Jewar as a “jewel not only for UP but also for the country,” adding that the state’s development will be aligned with the Prime Minister’s vision for chip manufacturing.Bob Chen, President of Foxconn’s Semiconductor Business Group, was quoted by news agency PTI as saying, “Today we are ground breaking for India chip. We want to establish reliable semiconductor assembly and testing facility in India. We look forward to growing together and contributing to India's growth in global technology landscape.”HCL Group Chairperson Roshini Nadar highlighted that the facility will serve both domestic and international markets, positioning India as a significant player in the global semiconductor sector.","India chip pvt ltd is a joint venture between the hcl group and foxconn.

'Global South To Decide Next World Order': Stubb And Rubio Signal Shift, Echoe India's World View

New Delhi: India has emerged as a ""shining beacon"" among Global South nations on AI, but the real challenge now is moving beyond pilots to large-scale, trusted deployment, according to the 'Playbook for National AI Strategy and Implementation' released by Boston Consulting Group (BCG) and Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA).Based on work across India, Egypt, Indonesia, Bangladesh and the Philippines, the report argues there is no single lever to accelerate AI adoption. Countries instead need a tightly coordinated ecosystem spanning computing, funding, skills, governance and institutional accountability.Saibal Chakraborty, who leads BCG India's tech and digital advantage practice, said India already has a structural edge. ""India has solved a large part of the hard infrastructure and digital public infrastructure problem. Aadhaar, UPI and data centres make it much easier to build AI applications at scale,"" he said. The playbook cites the IndiaAI Mission's facilitation of over 38,000 GPUs, made available at under Rs 60 per hour after centralised govt negotiations with vendors.However, the report flags a financing gap. While India has more than 120 unicorns, private capital largely avoids ""socially sensitive sectors like climate, education and rural solutions"". To address this, the playbook backs govt-led fund-of-funds models for public interest AI use cases.On skills, Chakraborty said scaling artificial intelligence requires senior leadership trust and oversight. Without CEO-level confidence, AI risks remaining stuck in ""cool pilots"" despite strong national ambition","India has emerged as a ""shining beacon"" among global south nations on ai.

'AI Will Create More Than It Destroys': Microsoft India Chief Puneet Chandok Predicts 3-Year Rise

New Delhi: The increasing use of AI language models for information seeking and agentic commerce has put the existing internet business model under pressure, as these companies are crushing publishers, content creators, and small businesses, according to Matthew Prince, chief executive of internet infrastructure company Cloudflare.Explaining the problem, he said that for the past decade, individuals and creators - including researchers and small businesses - have sold subscriptions or shown ads to compensate for their work. But, now AI models scrape and regurgitate information, removing direct interaction between creators and users. ""Google was a great patron, but now things have changed.""For the last 10 years, for every two pages that Google scraped on the internet, they sent back one human visitor. Today, for every 30 pages, they send just one. It has become 15 times harder to get traffic from a Google search. Microsoft performs more poorly - it sends 70 to one. If we look at the pure AI companies, OpenAI takes 37,000 pages from the internet for every one visitor it sends back. In Anthropic's case, it's half a million pages,"" he said.Cloudflare handles almost 20% of internet traffic and works with all foundational model providers. ""The human eyeball traffic, which is the current currency of the internet, is going away. It is never going to return in the same way. We are getting more of our answers from AI than from original sources. And so we have to figure out a new way to compensate creators,"" he said. Prince said the world needs to figure out a new business model for the internet and develop a new rewards system beyond traffic.","Cloudflare ceo matthew prince says ai models are crushing publishers, content creators, and small businesses.

'India Well Positioned To Lead The World In AI': OpenAI CEO Sam Altman At AI Impact Summit

New Delhi: For years, Europe watched its best AI researchers migrate to the US. India has faced the same challenge - a steady bleeding of top engineering and computer science talent to Silicon Valley. Reversing this flow is central to the global AI race, says Arthur Mensch, co-founder and CEO of French startup Mistral AI. ""Like Europe, India was bleeding talent to the US,"" Mensch said in an interview with TOI. ""The more talent you retain and create value locally, the better.""Founded in 2023 by Mensch, Guillaume Lample and Timothee Lacroix, Mistral AI was created to challenge the opaque, closed nature of ""big AI"" and make frontier models more accessible through open architectures. In just three years, the company has scaled rapidly - reaching a $400 million revenue run rate and targeting over $1 billion in revenue soon. As of last year, it was valued at $14 billion.But for Mensch, the AI race is not just commercial. It is structural - and geopolitical. With Europe heavily reliant on overseas digital infrastructure, particularly US hyperscalers, Mistral has chosen to build its own capabilities.""We don't position ourselves as a sovereign alternative. We position ourselves as a global competitor in the AI race,"" he said. ""But tactically, to have capacity you fully control, you need infrastructure - the servers that run the technology. ""About 60% of Mistral's business comes from Europe and 40% from the rest of the world. Some customers opt for its platform precisely because it can be deployed on their own infrastructure, reducing dependence on hyperscalers.Sovereign AI, he believes, is both a strategic and political necessity. As AI begins to run large parts of the global economy, govts and defence systems cannot risk external control. For businesses, over-dependence weakens negotiating leverage and continuity.India, with one of the world's largest developer pools, has a similar inflection point. ""We've brought many European researchers back to Europe. India has a unique opportunity to do the same. Universities here produce excellent AI and computer science talent. The focus should be on ensuring they innovate and build value here,"" Mensch said. Mistral is currently building commercial partnerships in India, with a local technology centre a possible next step.While rivals such as OpenAI and Anthropic explore IPO paths, Mensch said a listing is ""down the road."" Profitability and global scale would be prerequisites.Mensch argues that much of enterprise AI adoption has stumbled because companies treated GenAI as a collection of tools rather than a platform shift. Early chatbot deployments focused on small productivity gains. ""That doesn't change the bottomline,"" he said. Instead, Mistral focuses on high-ROI use cases that address major sources of business friction.At the core of its strategy is open source. ""If you have access to model parameters, you can deploy wherever you want - including local infrastructure,"" Mensch said. Open models also allow customisation. ""Running a business should not mean over-dependence on a single service provider. I've said it multiple times - Europe cannot become an AI colony of the US.""","Mistral ceo arthur mensch: 'india well positioned to lead the world in ai' mistral ai was created to challenge the opaque, closed nature of ""big ai"" and make frontier models more accessible through open architectures.

Find out.Image via: Getty

Where Paige Spiranac's income really comes from



Paige Spiranac did not make her money by winning major golf tournaments. In fact, her professional playing career was relatively short. But what she did build, quietly and steadily, was one of the biggest personal brands in modern golf. Today, she is better known as a golf personality, influencer and media figure than as a former tour player. And that shift has paid off. As of 2026, Paige Spiranac’s net worth is widely estimated to be between $2 million and $3 million, as per Golf365 and most reports placing her in that range. The key point is this: her earnings have come from visibility, not prize money. Spiranac has more than 4 million followers on Instagram alone. Across platforms including TikTok, YouTube and X, her total audience is close to 11 million. That kind of reach matters. Brands pay for access to engaged audiences, and Spiranac has one of the most engaged followings in golf.Most of her revenue comes from sponsorships and brand partnerships. Industry estimates suggest she can earn somewhere between $8,000 and $12,000 for a single sponsored Instagram post, as per Golf Monthly, depending on the deal.Multiply that across campaigns and annual partnerships, and the numbers grow quickly. She has worked with golf and lifestyle brands such as Callaway, 18Birdies, Swag Golf, Lululemon and Women’s Health. These are not one-off collaborations. They are part of a steady commercial strategy built around her online presence.Beyond sponsored posts, Spiranac earns from subscription-based content, offering exclusive golf instruction and behind-the-scenes material to paying subscribers. That recurring income model gives her more stability than simple ad partnerships. She doesn’t just post ads. She includes products naturally in her golf content, so they feel part of what she’s already doing. She also earns money from event appearances, speaking engagements and hosting digital shows, which add to her total income. She has also expanded into media. Her appearance in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit edition broadened her audience beyond golf. More recently, she launched Paige Co., a new media venture in partnership with Pro Shop, the company connected to the creators behind Netflix’s Full Swing. The project focuses on original content and branded products, and she reportedly holds equity in the business.Paige Spiranac’s financial story is not about trophies. It is about timing, platform awareness and turning attention into ownership. She understood early that influence, when managed correctly, can become a long-term business.","Paige spiranac's net worth is widely estimated to be between $2 million and $3 million.

Jimmy Donaldson has built a career on spectacle, generosity, and relentless ambition. Still, life at the top of YouTube comes with a strange trade-off. Every expression, gesture, and frame gets dissected by millions of viewers. That reality surfaced again this week when a social media user claimed the creator’s eyes looked unusual and that they “never smile,” sparking a viral thread.Rather than ignore the remark, Donaldson chose to respond. His reply shifted attention away from appearance and toward a personal health issue he has quietly managed for years. The moment revealed how quickly online criticism can spread and how direct honesty can reset the tone of a conversation.Replying on X, Donaldson wrote, ""I love how the biggest criticism of me is about my eyes which are out of my control. I’m borderline blind in my right eye, the reason they look off is because I have to squint my right eye to see better even with my contacts in."" He followed it with a blunt admission: ""There is nothing I can do.""The original poster apologized after learning the reason. Supporters then flooded the thread with messages defending the creator and criticizing the tendency to fixate on appearance.One user wrote, ""People will literally find a way to villainize a man for the way his eyes focus while he’s busy curing blindness for thousands,"" referencing Donaldson’s well-known philanthropy projects that have funded vision surgeries.Another commenter urged empathy, writing, ""people will always attack what they can see instead of what actually matters... the fact you’re still showing up and explaining it takes more strength than they’ll ever admit, why do we act like someone’s face is public property,"" a sentiment that resonated widely.Not every response was sympathetic. Some critics questioned his authenticity on camera, while others mocked his wealth in relation to his condition. ""Don't you have enough money by now to buy new eyes?"", one said.Reports say that Donaldson's reach is growing, with close to a billion unique viewers watching his content every month. His honest answer did more than just explain a visual detail. It reminded people that there is a real person behind the thumbnails and viral challenges who is dealing with both global fame and everyday problems.","Youtube star jimmy donaldson responds to criticism about his eyes.

Senior staff are calling the tools ""broken slop generators""

CEO Julie Sweet had already warned: Adapt to AI or leave

Accenture has started tying promotion eligibility to AI tool usage, telling senior managers and associate directors that advancing to leadership roles will require demonstrating ""regular adoption"" of its artificial intelligence platforms. The move follows CEO Julie Sweet's earlier warning that employees unable to adapt to AI would be ""exited"" from the company — and it appears HR is now putting that stance into formal practice. The consulting giant has also begun tracking individual weekly logins to its AI tools for some senior staff, making it one of the more aggressive internal AI mandates seen at a major professional services firm.According to an internal email seen by the Financial Times, ""use of our key tools will be a visible input to talent discussions."" The policy is set to factor into the company's summer promotion decisions, with Accenture's AI Refinery among the tools being monitored.The reaction internally has been less than enthusiastic. Two people familiar with the changes told the FT they considered some of the tools to be ""broken slop generators,"" and one said they would ""quit immediately"" if the rule directly affected them. Staff in 12 European countries and those working on US federal government contracts are exempt from the new policy.The pushback isn't entirely surprising. Executives at three Big Four firms independently told the FT that getting senior managers and partners to adopt AI has proven far harder than with junior staff. Older, more senior professionals tend to be less comfortable with new technology and more attached to how they've always worked.Julie Sweet has made the company's position clear. She previously told investors that Accenture would ""exit"" employees for whom reskilling on AI wasn't a viable path—and the latest promotion criteria appear to be the formal follow-through on that stance.The firm says it has trained 550,000 of its roughly 780,000 employees in generative AI and spends around $1 billion annually on learning and development. It also recently announced partnerships with OpenAI and Anthropic.Still, the urgency makes sense given the context. Accenture's share price has dropped roughly 42% over the past year, and the company is betting heavily that its AI-first repositioning—including rebranding its workforce as ""reinventors""—will reverse that slide.","Accenture is tying senior staff promotions to ai tool usage.

Asha Sharma named new CEO of Microsoft Gaming: Read Satya Nadella’s message to staff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/asha-sharma-named-new-ceo-of-microsoft-gaming-read-satya-nadellas-message-to-staff/articleshow/128634558.cms,"Read Satya Nadella’s message to Microsoft staff

Gaming has been part of Microsoft from the start. Flight Simulator shipped before Windows, and you can practically ray‑trace a line from DirectX in the ’90s to the accelerated‑compute era we’re in today.

As we celebrate Xbox’s 25th year, the opportunity and innovation agenda in front of us is expansive. Today we reach over 500 million monthly active users, are a top publisher across all platforms, and continue to innovate across gaming hardware, content, and community, in service of creators and players everywhere.

I am long on gaming and its role at the center of our consumer ambition, and as we look ahead, I’m excited to share that Asha Sharma will become Executive Vice President and CEO, Microsoft Gaming, reporting to me. Over the last two years at Microsoft, and previously as Chief Operating Officer at Instacart and a Vice President at Meta, Asha has helped build and scale services that reach billions of people and support thriving consumer and developer ecosystems. She brings deep experience building and growing platforms, aligning business models to long-term value, and operating at global scale, which will be critical in leading our gaming business into its next era of growth.

Matt Booty will become Executive Vice President and Chief Content Officer, reporting to Asha. Matt’s career reflects a lifelong commitment to games and to the people who make them. Under his leadership, Microsoft Gaming has grown to span nearly 40 studios across Xbox, Bethesda, Activision Blizzard, and King, which are home to beloved franchises including Halo, The Elder Scrolls, Call of Duty, World of Warcraft, Diablo, Candy Crush, and Fallout.

Together, Asha and Matt have the right combination of consumer product leadership and gaming depth to push our platform innovation and content pipeline forward. Last year, Phil Spencer made the decision to retire from the company, and since then we’ve been talking about succession planning. I want to thank Phil for his extraordinary leadership and partnership. Over 38 years at Microsoft, including 12 years leading Gaming, Phil helped transform what we do and how we do it. He expanded our reach across PC, mobile, and cloud; nearly tripled the size of the business; helped shape our strategy through the acquisitions of Activision Blizzard, ZeniMax, and Minecraft; and strengthened our culture across our studios and platforms. I’ve long admired Phil’s unwavering commitment to players, creators, and his team, and I am personally grateful for his leadership and counsel. He will continue working closely with Asha to ensure a smooth transition.

We have extraordinary creative talent across our studios and a global platform that is second to none. I’m excited for how we will capture the opportunity ahead and define what comes next, while staying grounded in what players and creators value.

Please join me in congratulating Asha and Matt on their new roles, and in thanking Phil for everything he has done for Microsoft and for our industry.

Phil Spencer, Microsoft Gaming CEO is retiring. The software giant has named another Microsoft executive Asha Sharma as the new Vice President and CEO of Microsoft Gaming. Announcing the update, CEO Satya Nadella has sent an email to Microsoft staff where he said: “I’m excited to share that Asha Sharma will become Executive Vice President and CEO, Microsoft Gaming, reporting to me”. “Over the last two years at Microsoft, and previously as Chief Operating Officer at Instacart and a Vice President at Meta, Asha has helped build and scale services that reach billions of people and support thriving consumer and developer ecosystems,” Nadella said.In the message, Satya Nadella also praised outgoing Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer.

This change, highlighted by a product manager's new focus on AI-driven creation, aligns with CEO Mark Zuckerberg's vision of AI dramatically altering work. Companies like LinkedIn are also redefining roles, empowering individuals to code, design, and manage products with AI assistance.

Zuckerberg set the tone on the earnings call

LinkedIn, Google are making similar moves

Something is shifting at Meta, and it's not just the org chart. Some product managers at the company have started calling themselves ""AI builders""—a quiet but telling sign of how AI coding tools are beginning to blur the lines between who plans products and who actually builds them. It's a small label change, but it points to something bigger: the traditional PM role, long defined by roadmaps and stakeholder meetings, is quietly being rebuilt from scratch.Jeremie Guedj, a Meta product manager with over a decade of experience, announced the change on LinkedIn last week. ""I still can't believe I'm writing this: as of today, my full-time job at Meta is AI Builder,"" he wrote. His official title in Meta's internal systems hasn't changed, but his day-to-day work is now entirely focused on building with AI on what he calls an ""AI-native team."" At least three other Meta employees—a mix of product managers and engineers—also use the term in their LinkedIn bios, as first reported by Business Insider.The shift tracks with what Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during the company's Q4 2025 earnings call in January. ""We're elevating individual contributors and flattening teams,"" he said, adding that ""projects that used to require big teams"" are now being pulled off by a single person armed with the right AI tools.He called 2026 ""the year that AI starts to dramatically change the way that we work"" inside Meta.Guedj's new role looks a lot like what that vision looks like in practice—a team where ""humans and AI agents work together, synchronously and asynchronously,"" as he put it.Meta isn't alone here. LinkedIn recently scrapped its associate product manager program and replaced it with an ""associate product builder"" track, explicitly pushing new hires to code, design, and manage products all at once. At Google, at least one product manager told Business Insider that they've been encouraging designers and PMs on their team to ""blur roles a bit.""""AI builder"" isn't an official Meta designation—yet. But as Guedj put it: ""Building has always been my passion. AI gave me the ability to turn ideas into real, working apps. That changed everything.""","Product managers at meta are calling themselves ""ai builders"" it's a small label change, but it points to something bigger.

Indian talent is quite poor

I used to think

Perhaps it was just trauma from 20 years ago, when I was building the early team at Shaadi.com and hiring was a nightmare.

We didn’t have Product Managers, Devs or UX designers.

We had project managers, graphic designers, journalists & PR folks whom I had to bribe with tea and dreams to help me build a website.

If you could speak English and didn't blink for ten minutes, you were hired.

Literally

Today, its different.

I’ve spent the last six months hiring for the mid and senior levels. The depth of talent isn't just better, it’s world-class.

People who would’ve stayed in Silicon Valley a decade ago are now landing in Bengaluru and Mumbai, not because they have to, but because the work here is inspiring.

Yes, tighter immigration policies abroad have helped. But that’s not the story.

The real shift is what we built here over 20 years.

Internet-first companies.

Real product cultures.

Designers who think like builders.

Engineers who’ve scaled from zero to millions of users.

Operators who’ve survived chaos & shipped anyway.

We used to import talent. Now we manufacture it. At scale

Reverse migration

is a headline. The digital ecosystem is the plot. Are we finally over the settling abroad obsession, or have we just found a better reason to stay?

Shark Tank judge and founder of Shaadi.com Anupam Mittal recently praised the Indian tech talent saying that those who would’ve stayed in the US decade ago are coming back to India. In a post on Microsoft-owned LinkedIn, Mittal reflected on his experience building Shaadi.com two decades ago, when hiring skilled product and technology professionals in India was difficult. “Perhaps it was just trauma from 20 years ago, when I was building the early team at Shaadi.com and hiring was a nightmare. We didn’t have Product Managers, Devs or UX designers. We had project managers, graphic designers, journalists & PR folks whom I had to bribe with tea and dreams to help me build a website,” he wrote.Mittal compared it with today’s situation which, with deep talent at mid and senior levels, is different. According to Anupam Mittal, India’s growing digital ecosystem and mature product culture are driving this change, alongside a trend of professionals choosing to work in India by choice rather than compulsion.","Shaadi.com founder anupam mittal says indian tech talent is world-class.

Increase overall safety

Lower long-term treatment costs

Genetic interventions for brain disorders

Cell-based therapy models to study disease progression

Biomarker identification to track disease and treatment response

Tools to better understand how brain diseases evolve over time

The UAE's healthcare vision



Why this matters?





The UAE has officially entered a new era of ""precision medicine."" Moving away from simply managing symptoms, Emirates Health Services (EHS) recently unveiled two ambitious gene therapy projects designed to strike at the root causes of autism and rare brain disorders.By leveraging genetic engineering, the UAE isn't just treating patients, it’s aiming to ""repair"" the biological blueprints that cause these conditions in the first place.The United Arab Emirates has unveiled two groundbreaking gene therapy projects focused on treating serious neurological and genetic conditions in children. These efforts mark a major shift from conventional symptom-based care to tackling the underlying genetic causes of disease, potentially transforming neurodevelopmental healthcare in the region.One key project focuses on genetic causes linked to autism and epilepsy. It is being developed in collaboration with the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP), a world-renowned paediatric research centre.Scientists will work on enhanced gene delivery systems that target specific brain cells, which could:The project specifically includes rare conditions such as Beta-Propeller Protein-Associated Neurodegeneration (BPAN), a disorder that often begins in childhood with autism-like symptoms and seizures before progressing to serious motor and cognitive decline.This strategy represents a major scientific shift because it aims to treat the root genetic causes rather than just managing symptoms.The second gene therapy initiative centres on neurodegenerative diseases. Researchers will explore methods to repair faulty genes and use advanced techniques such as:Artificial intelligence and data analytics will help researchers make sense of genetic information collected through national programmes like the Emirati Genome Programme, enabling earlier diagnosis and intervention for children at higher risk.This approach relies on cutting-edge technology and global expertise to refine treatment precision and open doors for future inherited disease therapies.Leading experts at EHS described the projects as part of a “strategic shift” in healthcare, moving from traditional care models to evidence-based, innovation-driven treatments that directly address the causes of genetic disease.Dr Issam Al Zarooni, Executive Director of Medical Services at EHS, highlighted that this direction aims to improve quality of life and local capabilities in advanced medicine and biotechnology.Meanwhile, Dr. Noor Al Mheiri, Director of Mental Health and Visiting Physicians at EHS, stressed that integrating scientific research with responsible clinical application is key to reducing the psychological, social, and economic burdens families face.Autism and rare neurogenetic disorders affect thousands of families globally and in the UAE. Researchers have long been exploring genetic and early diagnostic methods, including genome sequencing and machine-learning diagnostic tools, to better understand and detect these conditions.The new UAE projects build on this broader scientific momentum, offering hope for earlier, more effective, and personalised treatments that could one day change how conditions like monogenic autism and other brain diseases are treated.","Uae breaks new ground in children’s healthcare with cutting-edge gene therapy initiatives.

'Bulls***t': Macron Slams Social Media's 'Free Speech' Rhetoric, Calls For Algorithm Transparency





NEW DELHI: French President Emmanuel Macron sharply criticized social media companies and their technology executives, accusing them of falsely presenting themselves as champions of free speech.Speaking at the AI Summit being held in the national capital, Macron said, “Some of them claim to be in favor of free speech. We are in favor of free algorithms, totally transparent.”“Free speech is pure bullshit if nobody knows how you are guided through this,"" Politico quoted him saying.“All the algorithms have biases, we know that. There is no doubt. And they are so impactful, when you speak about social media, that having no clue about how the algorithm is made, how it is tested and where it will guide you — the democratic biases of this could be huge,” he added.Over the past decade, European Union lawmakers in Brussels have rolled out sweeping legislation aimed at curbing the power of major technology platforms. Landmark measures such as the General Data Protection Regulation, the Digital Services Act and the Digital Markets Act were designed to strengthen privacy protections, rein in anti-competitive behavior and impose stricter obligations on content moderation. Washington, however, has framed elements of these laws as incompatible with US constitutional protections for speech.The dispute has since widened into a broader political clash, with American officials and several tech companies warning that Europe’s rules verge on censorship. European leaders counter that the regulations are necessary to tackle illegal content, disinformation and platform abuses.Among the most vocal has been Macron, who has repeatedly called for tighter limits on social media access for younger users — a stance that is gaining traction across parts of Europe as public concern over online harms intensifies.","French president emmanuel macron sharply criticized social media companies and their technology executives.

Which planets can you see?

Precise timings across the UAE

Between 6:40 PM and 7:30 PM.

Venus and Jupiter will be the first to ""ignite"" in the sky as twilight fades.

At 7:10 PM, the sky will be dark enough to see the fainter planets, but the alignment will still be high enough above the horizon to avoid being blocked by buildings or distant dunes.

By 8:15 PM, Saturn and Neptune will begin to set in the west, meaning the ""full parade"" will be over for the night.

Viewing beyond Dubai

Abu Dhabi (Al Ain): Head to the base of Jebel Hafeet. The elevation provides a crisp, clear view of the eastern horizon, perfect for spotting Mars as it rises.

Sharjah: The Mleiha Archaeological Centre is a designated dark-sky area. They often host specialized astronomy pop-ups during events like this, offering professional telescopes to the public.

Ras Al Khaimah : If you can make the drive, Jebel Jais is arguably the best spot in the entire country. At nearly 2,000 meters above sea level, you are literally above much of the atmospheric haze, making the planets look like sharp diamonds.

Fujairah: The Al Hajar Mountains provide excellent silhouettes for photographers. Just ensure you find a spot with a clear, unobstructed view toward the West.





This Ramadan, the heavens offer a gift that requires no telescope, just a clear view of the horizon. On Saturday, February 21, 2026, residents of the UAE are in for a rare treat as six planets align in a ""planetary parade"" across the night sky.While Dubai's city lights are famous, the real show will happen far above the skyscrapers, with the Al Qudra Desert serving as the ultimate front-row seat for this astronomical event.Venus and Jupiter will anchor the show, serving as the easiest planets to find as they shine like brilliant white beacons in the twilight. Mars will be equally recognizable, standing out with its distinct and steady reddish-orange hue that separates it from the flickering stars nearby.While these brighter planets are visible to the naked eye, the ""Hidden Giants""—Uranus and Neptune—are tucked much farther away in the depths of the solar system. To glimpse these icy distant worlds, experts recommend bringing a pair of basic binoculars or a small telescope to pull their faint light into view.Adding to the night's beauty, the Moon will also join the party, perfectly positioned near the alignment to act as a natural guidepost, helping you trace the planets' path across the sky.While the planets won't wait for anyone, there is a ""golden window"" to catch them at their clearest. The parade officially begins shortly after the sun dips below the horizon.You don’t have to be in the Al Qudra desert to enjoy the show. If you are outside of Dubai, here are the prime viewing spots where the ""Planetary Parade"" will be just as spectacular:A planetary alignment occurs when the planets’ orbits bring them to the same side of the Sun from Earth’s perspective. While it looks like they are standing in a line, they are actually millions of miles apart in space, it is simply a beautiful trick of geometry.This specific six-planet parade is considered rare because of the number of planets involved and their high visibility in the northern hemisphere. For many in the UAE, this event is more than just science; it is a moment of reflection and wonder during a holy month dedicated to looking toward the heavens.","Witness six planets align over dubai’s night sky tonight — a rare ramadan sky event you don’t want to miss. Venus and jupiter will be the first to ""ignite"" in the sky as twilight fades. By 8:15 pm, saturn and neptune will begin to set in the west, meaning the ""full parade"" will be over for the night.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128637564,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-26310,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Headquarters relocation milestone









Foreign companies without a regional headquarters in Saudi Arabia are no longer automatically out of the running for government contracts. Under a revised procurement framework, government entities may apply for structured exemptions, softening the strict 2024 relocation requirement while preserving the broader policy objective.From the beginning of 2024, government bodies were barred from contracting with foreign companies whose regional headquarters were located outside Saudi Arabia. The directive applied to all government agencies, institutions, funds and their affiliated entities.The new step does not cancel that decision. Instead, it introduces a structured pathway for exceptions in cases where projects require highly specialised technical expertise or where strong financial competitiveness justifies it.The Local Content and Government Procurement Authority has formally communicated the regulatory framework governing such contracts, including arrangements involving related parties.Government entities may now submit a request to a designated committee seeking an exemption for:The request must be filed before issuing a tender or initiating direct contracting procedures.To streamline the process, the authority has launched an electronic service through the “Etimad” digital platform.The service went live in November 2025 and is available to government entities that publish their tenders via the platform.For tenders published before the service was introduced, or those issued outside “Etimad”, the previously established submission mechanism will continue to apply.The “Etimad” platform serves as the Ministry of Finance’s official electronic portal for financial services. It supports the digital transformation of government operations and aims to enhance transparency and efficiency across budgets, contracts, tenders, payments and procurement processes.The system is also designed to strengthen interaction between government entities and the private sector.The regulations clarify that companies without a regional headquarters in the Kingdom are not automatically excluded from public tenders. However, their bids will only be accepted under two specific conditions:Projects with an estimated value not exceeding SR1 million are exempt from these restrictions.By early 2026, more than 700 international companies had relocated their regional headquarters to Saudi Arabia. This figure surpasses the original target of attracting 500 companies by 2030.The relocation policy was introduced to deepen the integration of foreign companies working with Saudi government entities and affiliated bodies. It also seeks to generate employment, reduce economic leakage, enhance spending efficiency and ensure that key products and services are delivered domestically with appropriate local content.The latest exemption mechanism reflects an effort to maintain those objectives while allowing room for specialised expertise and competitive advantage when required.","Saudi arabia now allows conditional exemptions for foreign firms lacking kingdom-based regional headquarters.
