Bid that bagged the 12 Earth Observation satellites PPP Project quoted Rs 0,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/bid-that-bagged-the-12-earth-observation-satellites-ppp-project-quoted-rs-0/articleshow/123291019.cms,"BENGALURU: In what’s unprecedented, the L1 quotation (lowest bid) by the consortium that won the 12 Earth Observation satellites project being implemented as a PPP by IN-SPACe, is Rs 0 (zero rupees). The consortium comprising Pixxel, PierSight, SatSure and Dhruva, which will bear the financial cost of the project, will invest more than Rs 1,2000 crore in the next four-five years.Confirming this, IN-SPACe chairman Pawan Goenka told TOI in a one-on-one interaction: “Obviously this was a competitive bid and each of the bidders would have evaluated the value of giving the opportunity to build this constellation. In the judgment of the winning bidder, they decided that even if they don’t get any money from the govt, it is important for them to get this opportunity to develop it and therefore they see a good financial opportunity in this constellation. ”Terming it a very big endorsement of how the private sector sees the future of space economy in India, he said: “...for a consortium to come forward and commit to invest more than Rs 1,200 crores of their own money with a full expectation, obviously, that they will more than recover their investment over a period of time.So I think it’s very, very positive news that the winning bidder has bid only zero.”As reported by TOI on Wednesday, the constellation of 12 satellites will feature a mix of sub-metre very high-resolution, wide-swath multispectral, synthetic aperture radar (SAR), and hyperspectral satellites, enabling applications such as precision agriculture, water quality monitoring, land-use mapping, environmental compliance, disaster assessment, maritime operations, national security and infrastructure development.The project will be implemented through a special purpose vehicle (SPV). “We have a time limit of 90 days for signing the agreement starting yesterday. Hopefully we sign much before that. As per the RFP, the lead player must have at least 26% ownership and each consortium member at least 10%. It will be a legal entity formed with well-defined roles for each of the four members.”SatSure CEO Prateep Basu said: “SatSure will be contributing two satellites in this consortium, with its novel optical and multi-spectral wide swath imager developed by its subsidiary KaleidEO. We’ll be commercialising our novel payload that provides high coverage at sub-meter spatial resolution. I believe this is a milestone not just for India’s space story, but for how EO technology can deliver meaningful, measurable value to users across different industries. ”PierSight will be producing at least two, if not three SAR satellites, while the remaining will be hyperspectral satellites from Pixxel’s stable. “SAR makes the constellation operational 24/7 in all weather conditions. Our role is to deliver radar‐first, analysis‐ready products with low latency, so agencies and enterprises get alerts and evidence, not just raw data,” PierSight CEO Gaurav Seth, said.Dhruva Space CEO Sanjay Nekkanti said the project reflects growing confidence in India’s private space tech sector. The company plans to leverage its upcoming spacecraft manufacturing facility in Telangana to scale production and offer turnkey ground station infrastructure. In partnership with consortium members, Dhruva aims to build an end-to-end, sovereign EO ecosystem.Goenka said IN-SPACe was very happy with the outcome, and added that when they started, the agency didn’t know whether there will be enough interest in the private sector to take on a project of this nature, because this is one of the largest investments made by the private sector in the space sector.“...Finally, to have three people qualify for the commercial bid, each wanting the project very, very badly, gives us confidence that there is tremendous optimism about the space sector opportunities in the private sector… It is a validation of the whole space sector reform,” he said.","The consortium comprising pixxel, piersight, satsure and dhruva will bear the financial cost of the project.

Jayson Tatum’s Boston Celtics get stamp of approval for $6.1 billion sale from NBA’s Board of Governors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/jayson-tatums-boston-celtics-get-stamp-of-approval-for-6-1-billion-sale-from-nbas-board-of-governors/articleshow/123293326.cms,"Jayson Tatum with Boston Celtics jersey.

Is the Boston Celtics up for sale?



Boston Celtics’ valuation went from $360 Million to $6.1 Billion



Jayson Tatum’s team, the Boston Celtics, just received the league’s official green light for a record-setting sale. The NBA Board of Governors unanimously approved the $6.1 billion purchase of the team by an investor group led by Massachusetts native Bill Chisholm. The transaction, first agreed to in March, is expected to close soon, marking one of the most expensive deals in U.S. sports history.When Boston Basketball Partners LLC announced plans to sell the franchise in July, the deal was set to unfold in two phases, with current CEO and governor Wyc Grousbeck staying in charge through the 2027–28 season. But under NBA ownership rules, governors must hold at least a 15% stake. Since Grousbeck’s share will fall below that threshold, Chisholm will now assume the governor's role immediately.Despite the change, ESPN reports both men “plan to run the team together as originally planned.” The investor group also features current Celtics co-owner Rob Hale, Related Companies president Bruce Beal Jr., and Sixth Street Partners. BDT & MSD Partners, J.P. Morgan, and the Jordan Park Group advised the sellers, while Goldman Sachs represented the buyers. Legal counsel came from Cooley LLP for the Grousbeck family and Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz for the Chisholm-led group.Chisholm, co-founder and managing partner of Symphony Technology Group, has a track record of steering major investments across software, security, and data services. Calling himself a “die-hard Celtics fan,” he beat out at least two rival bids, including one from former Celtics minority partner Steve Pagliuca.The Grousbeck family, along with Steve Pagliuca, bought the Celtics in 2002 for $360 million. Under their stewardship, the team captured two NBA titles in 2008 and 2024, pushing their championship tally to a record 18. The franchise’s value has soared, fueled by the NBA’s booming media rights market.When the deal closes, Chisholm’s group will control at least 51% of the Celtics, with full ownership expected by 2028. The final price could reach $7.3 billion — eclipsing the $6.05 billion paid for the NFL’s Washington Commanders and the $4 billion valuation of the Phoenix Suns in 2023. The only higher North American sports sale came earlier this year when the Los Angeles Lakers sold for $10 billion.Also Read: Indiana Fever survive mid-game drama as Caitlin Clark prevents enraged coach from earning technical foul Boston’s on-court success comes with off-court challenges. The team carries one of the league’s largest payrolls and does not own its home arena, TD Garden, limiting revenue from concerts and non-basketball events, which has been a growing income source for many franchises. Still, with Jayson Tatum leading a championship-caliber roster and a high-profile ownership group at the helm, the Celtics enter the next chapter of their storied history with record-breaking momentum.","The nba board of governors unanimously approved the $6.1 billion purchase of the team by an investor group led by massachusetts native bill chisholm.

How to Reduce Fall Damage in Battlefield 6?

1. Master the Combat Roll

Battlefield 6 Beta - Ultimate Beginners Guide, Tips and Tricks

2. Use Terrain to Your Advantage

3. Dive to Break Momentum

Works best when landing on grass or dirt.

Less effective on concrete or metal surfaces.

4. Combine Sprint and Crouch Landing

Ideal when you can’t line up a perfect roll.

Keeps your weapon ready faster after landing.



Battlefield 6 The ULTIMATE Beginner's Guide! (BEST SETTINGS & MORE!)

5. Know Your Height Limits

Test with full HP before trying in combat.

Keep an eye out for warning indicators in your HUD.

6. Be Aware of Your Surroundings

Scan for enemies at your landing spot.

Plan an escape route.



If you’ve been leaping from rooftops, cliff edges, or helicopters inonly to get knocked out before the fight even starts, you’re doing it wrong. The game’s movement system gives you multiple ways to land smarter, take less damage, and stay in the fight longer. Here’s a quick guide to mastering safer landings in BF6.Here are some tips to reduce the damage you take after a fall in Battlefield 6:The single most effective way to cut fall damage is the combat roll. Just before hitting the ground, tap your crouch key. Done right, your soldier tucks into a smooth roll, transferring impact away from your legs. This not only saves health but also keeps you ready to shoot faster after landing.Timing is everything. Hit the crouch inputbefore impact. If you press too early, you’ll simply crouch mid-air; too late, and you’ll eat the damage.Before you jump, scan your surroundings. Landing on softer or sloped surfaces reduces the damage compared to flat concrete. Even clipping an awning or railing mid-fall can break your momentum and save HP. Battlefield 6’s destructible environments often create new ledges or debris piles.Hence, use them as “stepping stones” to break big drops into smaller ones.The dive mechanic isn’t just for dodging bullets; it can help soften your landing. If you jump from a moderate height, hit the dive button mid-air to change your body position and spread the impact.If you’re in full sprint, you can transition into a crouch landing to disperse momentum. This technique isn’t as damage-reducing as a combat roll, but it can still make a difference in those borderline jumps.Not every jump can be saved. If you leap from extreme heights, even perfect timing won’t prevent severe damage or death. Learn the safe height threshold in each map by experimenting in low-stakes situations.Many deaths from fall damage aren’t because of bad mechanics; they’re from bad decisions. Before you jump:Reducing fall damage in Battlefield 6 comes down to perfect timing, smart terrain use, and knowing your limits. Master the combat roll, break your falls into smaller drops, and always think before you leap. In a game where every second of survival counts, a clean landing could be the difference between clutching the win or watching the kill cam.","Reducing fall damage in battlefield 6 comes down to perfect timing, smart terrain use, and knowing your limits.

Apple’s next iPhone release, the iPhone 17 series , could mark a notable shift—for the first time in years, consumers may see higher prices at launch. Analyst Jeff Pu from GF Securities reports that US tariffs on devices from China and India could push prices up by $50 to $100 compared to the iPhone 16 models. At the same time, Apple may increase the base storage on the Pro model to 256GB, adding more value behind the higher price. As September approaches, buyers and analysts are watching closely. The coming decisions will influence not only budgets but also the broader discussion around trade, manufacturing, and consumer expectations in the tech world.According to MacRumors, market projections suggest that at least some iPhone 17 models will cost between $50 and $100 more than their predecessors. This would be the first price increase for the Pro model since the iPhone X in 2017.One way Apple may lessen the sting is by increasing the minimum storage on the Pro model from 128GB to 256GB. This aligns with existing practices and can help justify a higher base price with a tangible upgrade.According to Jeff Pu, new US tariffs on products imported from iPhone assembly hubs like China and India are expected to raise production costs. While imports from China carry a 20% tariff, devices made in India are currently exempt. However, since Apple now brings most of its US-sold iPhones from India, these cost pressures still affect pricing decisions. The unpredictable nature of US trade policy adds another layer of uncertainty to Apple’s cost structure. Still, Apple fans remain eager to see what innovations the new iPhone 17 will bring despite potential price changes.Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 17 lineup, including standard, Pro, Pro Max, and possibly an “Air” or “Slim” model, on September 9, 2025. Pre-orders may begin on September 12, with shipments and retail availability starting September 19.Potential starting prices based on recent leaks:According to Business Insider, Apple’s Q3 earnings report revealed $94 billion in revenue, supported by strong iPhone sales. Despite this, the company incurred $800 million in tariff costs, expected to rise to $1.1 billion next quarter. Analysts warn that continued cost challenges may force Apple to raise prices more broadly, not just in the US, potentially affecting global retail pricing strategies.","Apple iphone 17 series 'likely' to launch with higher prices; new leak claims.

Improve your creativity with these 7 lessons from Steve Jobs







Connecting the dots



Steve Jobs' 2005 Stanford Commencement Address

Stay hungry, stay foolish



Simplify relentlessly



Say no to a thousand things



Start with human experience



Think different with deep focus



Build teams that raise the bar

Steve Jobs, celebrated for his groundbreaking innovations, believed creativity thrives through intentional habits and mindsets. From his famous “connecting the dots” philosophy to maintaining a beginner’s mindset and relentlessly simplifying ideas, Jobs shared key principles for unlocking creative potential. He stressed the importance of focused effort, saying no to distractions, designing with empathy , and building high-performing teams . Embracing these seven tips can help you nurture creativity, spark innovation, and achieve meaningful breakthroughs in your personal and professional life.In the 2005 Stanford Commencement Address, Steve Jobs shared his personal story about “connecting the dots,” highlighting a key aspect of creativity. He explained that creativity often comes from linking ideas across different fields. Jobs encouraged embracing diverse experiences—whether in arts, technology, calligraphy, or history—and reflecting on them regularly. The wider your range of influences, the greater your ability to combine seemingly unrelated concepts in new and surprising ways, sparking fresh insights and innovative solutions. He also emphasized that trust in the process and following your curiosity without immediate certainty can lead to extraordinary breakthroughs in life and work.Maintaining a beginner’s mindset is key to sustaining creativity. Jobs famously urged people to remain curious and open to learning, avoiding complacency. This means continually challenging yourself with new projects, taking smart risks, and engaging in learning sprints—short bursts of intense focus on acquiring new skills or knowledge. This hunger and willingness to experiment keeps your mind agile and open to breakthrough ideas.One hallmark of Jobs’s work was simplicity. He believed stripping ideas down to their essential core made them clearer and more powerful. When something feels complicated or hard to explain, it usually needs refinement. Focus on clarity by removing unnecessary features or distractions, so the core concept shines. Simplicity not only enhances understanding but also makes your ideas feel inevitable and compelling.Focus is a vital ingredient of creativity. Jobs emphasized the importance of saying “no” to many distractions and opportunities to protect your energy and time. Instead of spreading yourself thin, channel your efforts into one or two key projects that really matter.

This virus is turning rabbits into ‘zombie bunnies’ with horn-like growths — can it spread to dogs or cats?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/this-virus-is-turning-rabbits-into-zombie-bunnies-with-horn-like-growths-can-it-spread-to-dogs-or-cats/articleshow/123288055.cms,"

What is the Shope papillomavirus in rabbits?

How the virus spreads among rabbits



Impact of the virus on rabbit health

Can it infect dogs, cats, or humans?







Where are infected rabbits most commonly found?

What to do if you see an infected rabbit





A bizarre, naturally occurring virus is giving wild rabbits a truly unsettling makeover — transforming their faces with horn-like or tentacle-shaped growths that have earned them the nickname “zombie bunnies. ” Known as Shope papillomavirus (SPV) or cottontail rabbit papillomavirus (CRPV), this infection primarily affects wild cottontail rabbits in the United States. While the strange protrusions are usually harmless to humans and other animals, they can cause severe problems for rabbits, from impaired vision to difficulty eating, sometimes making them easy targets for predators. The virus has fascinated scientists for decades, and sightings continue in parts of the Midwest every year.Shope papillomavirus is a DNA virus that specifically targets rabbits, especially wild cottontail species. First identified in the 1930s by Dr. Richard Shope, it has been the subject of scientific study for nearly a century. The virus causes wart-like tumors, called papillomas, to form on the head, face, and ears. These growths can resemble horns, spikes, or fleshy tentacles, creating the eerie “zombie bunny” look.While most growths are benign, they can sometimes become cancerous. Domestic rabbits, while less likely to contract SPV, can still be infected if exposed to wild carriers or infected biting insects.SPV is spread mainly through direct rabbit-to-rabbit contact or by blood-feeding insects such as mosquitoes, fleas, and ticks. These insects tend to target the head and ear areas where fur is thinner, making it easier for the virus to enter through small wounds. Once inside, the virus causes rapid skin cell growth, leading to the formation of tumours. The risk of spread is highest in warmer months when insect populations surge. In areas where rabbits congregate in high numbers, such as breeding grounds or food-rich fields, transmission can be swift and affect a significant portion of the population.Although the Shope papillomavirus rarely kills rabbits directly, its effects can be life-threatening in indirect ways. Large growths around the eyes can obstruct vision, making it harder to spot predators. Tumors near the mouth or nose can interfere with eating or breathing, potentially leading to starvation or respiratory distress. Infected rabbits often become slower and weaker, increasing their vulnerability to predators. While some rabbits develop an immune response that causes the growths to shrink or disappear over time, others may suffer from persistent or worsening tumors.The Shope papillomavirus is strictly species-specific — it only infects rabbits. This means there is no danger to humans, dogs, cats, or other common pets. However, domestic rabbits can be at risk if they are bitten by infected insects or come into direct contact with infected wild rabbits. Pet owners are advised to keep rabbits indoors during peak insect activity and to use protective enclosures outdoors. While SPV cannot “jump” to other animals, it can still have serious implications for pet rabbits if precautions are not taken.The virus is most often seen in wild rabbit populations in parts of the United States, especially in the Midwest, including South Dakota and Colorado. These regions frequently report sightings of rabbits with horn-like growths during late spring and summer. Because some infected rabbits show no visible symptoms, tracking the true spread of the virus can be difficult. Wildlife experts note that SPV has likely existed for centuries in North America, only becoming widely known after photographs of “horned rabbits” began circulating in popular media.If you encounter a wild rabbit with horn-like growths, it is best to observe from a distance. Handling or attempting to treat the animal can cause unnecessary stress and increase the risk of spreading the virus to other rabbits. Wildlife authorities recommend leaving infected wild rabbits undisturbed, as many can survive with the condition or recover naturally. For pet rabbits showing suspicious growths, a veterinarian should be consulted promptly. In severe cases, surgical removal of tumors may be necessary. Preventive care includes insect control, regular health checks, and keeping domestic rabbits separated from wild populations.","Shope papillomavirus is a dna virus that specifically targets rabbits, especially wild cottontail species.

"China push: In Nepal, EVs now account for 76% of all vehicles sold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/china-push-in-nepal-evs-now-account-for-76-of-all-vehicles-sold/articleshow/122960428.cms,"



KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Ev market share in nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including norway, singapore and ethiopia.

Later in the video, they can be seen rushing out of the restaurant's door after leaving their table. When they reveal their intent, a staff member may be seen pursuing them. According to the complaint by the eatery, those men ordered and consumed 197.30 pounds of food, which included lamb chops, several curries, and other dishes.The company later posted the bill on Facebook. The bill breakdown included four plain poppadoms for £5.60, one chutney tray for £2.20, two chargrilled lamb chops for £24.00, three chicken chat dishes for £30.00, two chicken tikka mains for £28.00, two chicken tikka masalas for £32.00, two boiled rice portions for £11.00, two garlic naans for £12.00, three chapatis for £12.00, one serving of chips for £4.50, and nine 330 ml glass bottles of Coke for £36.00.Police in Northamptonshire acknowledged that they are looking into the event as a possible theft.""This kind of behavior isn't just theft; it affects hardworking small businesses and our local community,"" they wrote in a Facebook post.Online, the post generated a range of responses. ""Eat at home if you can't afford it! One user asked, ""Why are people these days so lazy to cook?""“This is why you swipe a card before they’re seated. They don’t look like they can afford a McDonald’s, never mind a £200 restaurant bill,"" added the other user.","Four men in northampton, england, raced away from an indian restaurant without paying their 200-pound (about rs 21,000) bill.
