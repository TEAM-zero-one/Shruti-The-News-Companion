NEW DELHI: India's foodgrain production is estimated to have increased 6.6%, the fastest pace of expansion in the last eight years, to reach a new high of 354 million tonne (MT) in 2024-25. All major crops, including paddy, wheat, maize, groundnuts and soybean, reported record output during the crop year.Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan attributed the all-time record foodgrain output in 2024-25 to the Centre's farmer-friendly policies, including fair pricing, loss compensation and low-interest loans, and their proper implementation by state governments.""Overall foodgrain production is increasing continuously...Pulses and oilseeds output has to be increased further, for which efforts are being made,"" Chouhan said while releasing the third advance estimates of the overall foodgrain output.According to the estimates, wheat output was revised upward to 117 MT for 2024-25, compared with an earlier projection of 115 MT, while last year's production was at 113 MT. Paddy production is estimated at a record 149 MT, up from 138 MT in 2023-24, while maize output is projected at 42 MT.Coarse cereals production is estimated at 6 MT, higher than the previous year. Pulses production is estimated at 25 MT compared to 24 MT last year. Oilseeds production is projected at 43 MT, up from nearly 40 MT last year.Soybean production is estimated at 15.1 MT and groundnut production is estimated at 11.2 MT, which is 2.1 MT and 1.7 MT more than last year's production. Similarly, sugarcane production is estimated at 450 MT.Chouhan said due to increasing maize production, reducing costs, giving of fair prices, compensating for losses, giving loans at low interest rates and many other initiatives, the foodgrain reserves of the country are full.""Production is increasing continuously,"" he said. ""The production of pulses and oilseeds needs to be increased, for which efforts are being made,"" the agriculture ministry said in a statement.This is also good news for the rural economy and it comes at time when there is global uncertainty.","India's foodgrain production is estimated to have increased 6.6%, the fastest pace of expansion in the last eight years.

Doors opened to private sector to join race to develop desi 5th-gen fighters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/doors-opened-to-private-sector-to-join-race-to-develop-desi-5th-gen-fighters/articleshow/121448975.cms,"Photo/Agencies

NEW DELHI: India has finalised a new 'programme execution model' for the indigenous fifth-generation stealth fighter called the advanced medium combat aircraft (AMCA), under which private firms can also bid for the project along with defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL).The new model approved by defence minister Rajnath Singh, which aims to accelerate prototype development and induction of the AMCA through a 'robust' domestic aerospace industrial ecosystem, marks a radical departure from the country's long-standing policy of fighter production being solely the preserve of HAL.The defence ministry expects HAL, which has been facing major flak for the huge delay in production of the fourth-generation Tejas Mark-1A jets, to bid for the AMCA project in partnership with one or more private players, officials told TOI.The defence PSU, after all, ""already has its hands full"" with the planned production of 180 Tejas Mark-1A jets for around Rs 1.2 lakh crore, which is slated to be followed by another 108 4.5-generation Tejas Mark-2 jets, apart from several other aircraft and helicopter projects.""Private companies can also bid for the AMCA project independently, or in a joint venture with a foreign OEM (original equipment manufacturer), or as a consortium.It provides equal opportunities to both private and public sectors on a competitive basis. The bidder, of course, should be an Indian company compliant with domestic laws and regulations,"" an official said.""It's an important step towards harnessing indigenous expertise, capability and capacity to produce the twin-engine AMCA prototype. There will be a competition. It will not be handed over to HAL on a nomination basis,"" he added.Towards this end, the Aeronautical Development Agency (ADA) of DRDO, which is entrusted with designing and developing the 25-tonne AMCA, will soon issue an expression of interest (EoI) for its development phase through industry partnership.The move to accelerate the AMCA project comes at a time when Pakistan is on course to acquire at least 40 J-35A fifth-generation jets from China, which is now even flaunting sixth-generation prototypes with tailless airframes like Chengdu J-36 and Shenyang J-50.The IAF, meanwhile, is grappling with just 30 fighter squadrons (each has 16-18 jets) when 42.5 are authorised. At least eight more squadrons are slated for retirement over the next 10 years.The PM-led cabinet committee on security in March last year had cleared the full-scale engineering development of five AMCA prototypes, along with a structural test specimen, extensive flight testing and certification, by ADA at an initial cost of over Rs 15,000 crore.As per existing timelines, the AMCA with the requisite thrust-to-weight ratio, advanced sensor fusion and stealth features like an internal weapons bay and 'serpentine air-intake' will be ready for production only by 2035.The IAF plans to induct seven squadrons (126 jets) of the expensive AMCA, which will also have AI-powered electronic pilot systems, netcentric warfare systems, integrated vehicle health management and the like.While the first two AMCA squadrons will be powered by the American GE-F414 engines in the 98 Kilonewton thrust class, the next five will have 110 Kilonewton engines.HAL and General Electric are conducting techno-commercial negotiations for co-production of the GE-F414 engines in India, with 80% of transfer of technology for around $1.5 billion.",India has finalised a new 'programme execution model' for the indigenous fifth-generation stealth fighter called the advanced medium combat aircraft.

When Cuban said Bill Gates 'stole' his girlfriends

Billionaire investor Mark Cuban has said that he is not impressed with the design choices of Tesla. Speaking at ""Your Mom's House"" podcast in March, he was asked ‘what's your favorite car?’. Cuban, who owns a Tesla replied with a grin “A Kia. EV6.” He further added “I like it. I'm comfortable with it.”Revealing that he hasn’t sold his Tesla ‘yet’, Mark Cuban explained: “On the Tesla you've got to find [the turn signal] and push the button… while you're driving. You can't pay attention to the road as much.”Praising Kia, he said: “It doesn't try to be too fancy. Your turn signal is like… a turn signal”.While Mark Cuban doesn’t mind driving a ‘cheaper’ Kia EV6, but his 15-year-old son isn’t impressed. When Cuban suggested handing down the car for driving practice, his son quickly shut it down, saying, “It’s not cool, Dad.” He even called it a “nerd car.” Cuban’s response? “Exactly,” he said, embracing the label.Mark Cuban is a known Elon Musk critic. Earlier this year on the ""Club Shay Shay"" podcast, Cuban admitted that he likes provoking Musk because he has ""really thin skin and it just makes it easy.""In another interview earlier this year, Cuban said “I have no problem throwing Elon under the bus, but I'll save it for when it's truly deserved.”Last year, when Musk encouraged users to share more positive content on X, Cuban wasted no time in delivering a sharp retort. “Please post a bit more positive, beautiful or informative content on this platform,” the Tesla CEO then wrote. Cuban commented “You first”.Cuban recently shared an anecdote from a night at COMDEX, which he claims was a major tech trade show in Las Vegas, where he found himself upstaged by none other than Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. At this event, Cuban recalled chatting with a group of women when they suddenly disappeared, only to learn they had left with Gates, who had just taken Microsoft public and was quickly becoming a tech icon. Cuban noted jokingly that Bill Gates took away “his girls.”During the podcast (Cue: 24.29), when asked about a business competition that keeps him up at night, Cuban shared the story about him and Bill Gates in Las Vegas. Cuban said, “I'll tell you a story about in Vegas back in the day about Bill Gates. This is way back, it used to be like the biggest trade show in the world was called Comdex. It was a technology trade show, and it was like 125,000 people here, and I started my company when I was 26, 27, right along this. So, I just thought I was a bada**, right? So I'm hanging with these girls, and this was right when Microsoft had gone public. So, one day no one knows who Bill Gates is, the next day he's the king of tech and all this money and all this snap.”","Billionaire investor mark cuban has said that he is not impressed with the design choices of tesla.

Explanation of Today’s Answers

The New York Times’ daily word game Connections continues to challenge players worldwide with clever puzzles that require grouping related words. The May 28 edition features a mix of movie references, musical wordplay, and mechanical terms, making it a fun but tricky challenge for fans. If you're stuck on any part of today’s game, we’ve got you covered with a detailed breakdown of the hints, groupings, and correct answers. From Oscar-winning films to bike parts, today's Connections puzzle was packed with clever links that tested both logic and cultural knowledge.Connections is a daily puzzle by The New York Times that tasks players with categorizing 16 seemingly unrelated words into four distinct groups of four. Each group shares a common thread—whether it's a shared meaning, association, or even a pun. It has become one of NYT’s most popular games, encouraging analytical thinking and lateral problem-solving.Each day, you’re presented with a grid of 16 words. Your job is to find four groups of four words that are connected in a meaningful way. Connections might be literal (like “bike parts”) or thematic (like “Best Picture winners”). The groups are colour-coded based on difficulty:Yellow – EasiestGreen – MediumBlue – ChallengingPurple – Most difficult, often wordplay-basedYou’re allowed up to four incorrect guesses. Make a mistake, and you lose a life. Lose four, and the game ends. You can shuffle the words to view them from a different perspective.Here are some helpful clues to nudge you in the right direction without spoiling the game immediately:Here are the correct groupings for today’s puzzle:Yellow (Connect): BRIDGE, JOIN, LINK, UNITEGreen (Parts of a Bike): CHAIN, PEDAL, SADDLE, WHEELBlue (Best Picture Winners since 2000): CHICAGO, CRASH, GLADIATOR, MOONLIGHTPurple (Music Genres + a Letter): BLUEST (blues), POPE (pop), ROCKY (rock), SKAT (ska)Yellow Group – Connect:These words all relate to the idea of connection or unity. ""Bridge,"" ""Join,"" ""Link,"" and ""Unite"" are all synonyms or actions that signify bringing together things or people.Green Group – Parts of a Bike:This mechanical group features key components of a bicycle: ""Chain,"" ""Pedal,"" ""Saddle"" (seat), and ""Wheel."" These are essential to the structure and movement of a standard bike.Blue Group – Best Picture Winners:All four—Chicago (2002), Crash (2005), Gladiator (2000), and Moonlight (2016)—won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Recognising them requires a bit of pop culture or film buff knowledge.Purple Group – Music Genres + a Letter:This was today’s trickiest category. Each word is a modified version of a popular music genre:Bluest = BluesPope = PopRocky = RockSkat = SkaThe added or altered letters cleverly disguise the genre, creating a challenging but rewarding puzzle category for sharp-eyed solvers.Whether you're a puzzle veteran or a new player, Connections continues to deliver fun, frustration, and satisfaction in equal measure. Stay tuned for tomorrow’s game, and may your winning streak continue!","Connections is a daily puzzle by the new york times that tasks players with categorizing 16 seemingly unrelated words into four distinct groups of four.

India’s biggest brain drain isn’t to Silicon Valley. It’s to the scroll.

Yes, I believe the next wave of global entrepreneurs will come from India

I have put my money on it

But we’re ALSO building the largest army of thumb warriors - overstimulated, under-inspired people, who're weirdly okay with it.

A billion screens.

A billion brains.

And what do most do with them?

Watch prank videos, swipe choreographed dances, and overdose on AI-generated “wisdom” like it’s roti-sabzi.

We didn’t evolve with media like the West did.

Radio → TV → Cable → Internet

We leapfrogged straight to Reels. And then fell right in

Even my 7-year-old starts with Peppa Pig and ends up in a vortex of glitchy animation and algorithmic chaos.

TikTok, Insta & YT did their job — they captured attention and monetized it.

But what did we lose in the process?

Teens that don’t talk.

Adults that don’t think - just scroll.

With AI, the stimulation will only intensify.

Opportunity?

Dystopia? Also

Feels like a ‘Black Mirror’ episode no one signed up for

This isn’t a call to delete Social apps. It’s not even a solution.

It’s a rant from a concerned father.

Shark Tank India judge Anupam Mittal recently started a debate on social media addiction . In a long LinkedIn post, Mittal said that India’s biggest brain drain isn’t talent leaving for Silicon Valley, but rather millions of minds lost to mindless scrolling. Mittal also expressed his concern over the digital consumption habits of Indians. He said that while the country is moving towards producing the next wave of global entrepreneurs , it is also building an army of overstimulated and under-inspired individuals. A billion screens. A billion brains. And what do most do with them? Watch prank videos, swipe choreographed dances, and overdose on AI-generated ‘wisdom’ like it’s roti-sabzi,” wrote Mittal.Along with this, Anupam Mittal also emphasised that unlike the West, which evolved through radio, TV, cable, and then the internet, India jumped straight to Reels—and fell right in. He shared a personal anecdote about his 7-year-old, who starts watching Peppa Pig but ends up in a glitchy vortex of algorithm-driven content.With AI intensifying digital stimulation, Anupam Mittal warned that India is raising a generation that doesn’t play, teens that don’t talk, and adults that don’t think—just scroll. “Feels like a ‘Black Mirror’ episode no one signed up for,” he remarked.💪🏼🤷🏼😵‍💫","Shaadi.com founder anupam mittal recently started a debate on social media addiction.

The Indian-American engineer Vaniya Agrawal who disrupted Microsoft's 50th anniversary celebrations in April this year again created disorder at another high-profile Microsoft event. In the latest incident, she disrupted Microsoft's ongoing developer event, Build 2025. Microsoft Build is the company’s annual developers conference. Vaniya Agrawal, along with another fired Microsoft employee Hossam Nasr, shouted at Microsoft’s head of security for AI, Neta Haiby.Haiby was co-hosting a Build session on best security practices for AI, alongside Sarah Bird, Microsoft’s head of responsible AI, when these two former Microsoft employees disrupted the talk to protest against the company’s cloud contracts with the Israeli government. This is the third day in a row that the Microsoft Build 2025 conference has been disrupted by Pro-Palestine protests.On Monday (May 19), shortly after Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella took the stage for his keynote address at the Build 2025 conference, an employee interrupted the speech. The employee started shouting “Free Palestine” and demanded accountability from the CEO for the company’s work with the Israeli government.Next day, on May 20, a Palestinian tech worker interrupted Microsoft executive Jay Parikh's keynote presentation, marking the second consecutive day of pro-Palestine protests at the event. ""Jay! My people are suffering!"" the protester shouted at Parikh, Microsoft's Executive Vice President of CoreAI, during his presentation on Azure AI technology. ""Cut ties! No Azure for apartheid! Free, free Palestine!"" Security personnel quickly escorted the demonstrator from the venue as he continued calling for Microsoft to end its contracts with the Israeli government.Earlier this year, Agrawal disrupted Microsoft’s 50th anniversary celebrations. As Microsoft current CEO Satya Nadella; and former CEOs Steve Ballmer and co-founder Bill Gates sat on stage talking about the company, Vaniya Agrawal stood up and started shouting. “Shame on you all. You’re all hypocrites,” she said. “50,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been murdered with Microsoft technology. How dare you. Shame on all of you for celebrating in their blood. Cut ties with Israel.” Vaniya was escorted out by the security.Microsoft has reportedly Blocked emails with certain words. According to a report in The Verge, ""Microsoft employees have discovered that any emails they send with the terms “Palestine” or “Gaza” are getting temporarily blocked from being sent to recipients inside and outside the company.""A software engineer in the company’s artificial intelligence division, Vaniya Agrawal publicly shared her resignation email last month.

She was asked to go with immediate effect, without completing her two-week notice. The other protester, Ibtihal Aboussad, too was terminated for ""acts of misconduct"" following similar disruptions at the Microsoft Anniversary event.Vaniya Agrawal has been constantly sharing photos of protests around Microsoft Build 2025 venues.

Apple is gearing up for the launch of its next iPhone series – iPhone 17 series in September 2025, continuing its annual tradition of fall releases. The series is rumoured to offer four models this year – iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max and an all-new slim iPhone – iPhone 17 Air. Similar to the past years, iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to be the most-expensive among all models. While official details remain under wraps, leaks and analyst reports suggest that Apple is focusing on both design and performance enhancements this year. The iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to feature a thinner and lighter titanium frame, a smaller Dynamic Island cutout, and notable improvements to its camera system, particularly in low-light and telephoto performance. Here’s what we know about the upcoming iPhone 17 Pro MaxBased on industry leaks and analyst reports, the device is likely to feature a thinner and lighter design, continuing the company’s shift toward titanium frames for durability and weight reduction. Apple is also rumored to reduce the size of the Dynamic Island, offering users a cleaner front display with more screen real estate.The iPhone 17 Pro Max is expected to retain its 6.7-inch display size but with slimmer bezels and an upgraded LTPO OLED panel that offers better brightness and power efficiency.Under the hood, the iPhone 17 Pro Max may be powered by the new A19 Pro chip, which could be built on a cutting-edge 2-nanometer process, delivering faster performance and greater energy efficiency, especially for on-device AI applications. Apple is also expected to increase RAM on the device to support more complex multitasking and machine learning tasks.In terms of camera improvements, rumors suggest an upgraded periscope telephoto lens for better zoom and enhanced low-light photography. The front-facing camera could see improvements in both quality and biometric capabilities. It is rumoured that all models under iPhone 17 series may offer a 24MP selfie camera, a major upgrade over the 12MP sensors found in the iPhone 16 series.Battery life may get a boost thanks to efficiency gains and possibly new battery technology. On the software side, iOS 19 is expected to power the device, potentially offering deeper integration of AI features and a more customizable user interface.Pricing is likely to remain in line with the iPhone 15 Pro Max, though more storage options may be introduced. More details are expected to emerge as the launch window approaches.","Apple is gearing up for the launch of its next iphone series - iphone 17 series in september 2025.

4 new Apple stores confirmed for Delhi, Mumbai, Pune and Bengaluru!

President Donald Trump seems quite not-so-happy with Apple's decision to make in India. The US President Donald Trump announced that Apple can build factories in India but will face a 25% tariff on products sold in the US if manufactured overseas. Speaking in the White House Oval Office during the signing of executive orders on nuclear energy, Trump referenced a discussion with Apple CEO Tim Cook , stating, ""I had an understanding with Tim that he wouldn’t be doing this. He said he’s going to India to build plants. I said, ‘That’s okay, but you’re not going to sell into here without tariffs.’""Trump stressed, ""We’re talking about the iPhone. If they’re going to sell it in America, I want it to be built in the United States."" Initially singling out Apple, he later broadened the tariff threat to include all smartphone manufacturers, such as Samsung and Huawei, saying, ""It would be anybody that makes that product, otherwise it wouldn’t be fair."" The tariffs are slated to take effect by the end of June 2025.Earlier in a social media post on the same day, Trump doubled down, writing, ""I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25 per cent must be paid by Apple to the US. American jobs come first!""During a recent trip to Doha, Trump had pressed Cook to focus on US manufacturing , noting India’s high tariffs make it a difficult market for US companies. He added, ""They’ve offered us a deal where they’re willing to charge us no tariff, but I told Tim, ‘I don’t want you building in India. Build here.’"" The US President highlighted that India’s tariff policies, among the highest globally, complicate market access, but he insisted on prioritizing domestic production.Apple CEO Tim Cook, addressing tariffs during Apple’s Q2 2025 earnings call, noted that they are determined by the product’s manufacturing location. Industry experts caution that relocating iPhone production to the US would sharply increase costs due to higher labor and operational expenses. If Apple passes these costs to consumers to maintain profit margins, iPhone prices could soar to $3,000 or more, potentially impacting demand. Analysts also point out that building a US-based supply chain would require significant investment and time, given the complex global network Apple currently relies on, primarily in Asia.The policy has sparked debate, with some economists warning that tariffs could raise consumer prices and disrupt global trade, while supporters argue it could boost US manufacturing jobs. The White House has not yet clarified how the tariffs will be implemented or whether exemptions might apply for companies investing in US facilities.In a related news, Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly declined offer to join tech exectuives and representatives at Trump's recent trip to the Middle East. The choice appeared to irritate Mr. Trump, said a New York Times report.","25% tariff if phones made in india: donald trump targets samsung after threat to apple. 4 new apple stores confirmed for delhi, mumbai, pune and bengaluru!

The Trump administration has slashed $766 million allocated in funding to Moderna Inc., an American biotech and pharmaceutical company responsible for developing vaccines. Moderna was tasked to make vaccines against potential pandemic influenza viruses, as well as the H5N1 bird flu.The Health and Human Services Department had notified the company on Monday about the withdrawal of funds that were awarded through the BARDA (Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority) program.HHS is withdrawing funds awarded in January and July this year, intended to finance the development and purchase of the company’s investigational vaccine.Moderna had received $590 million in January and $176 million in July in funding meant to help judge the efficacy of the vaccines for bird flu and other pandemic viruses, as said by a company Spokesperson.Health secretary Robert F. Kennedy has expressed his concerns regarding the company’s vaccines despite evidence that vaccines developed by Moderna are safe and have saved millions of lives before.“While the termination of funding from HHS adds uncertainty, we are pleased by the robust immune response and safety profile observed in this interim analysis,"" said the company in a statement as reported by AP.Using the same technology used to develop and roll out vaccines during the Covid-19 pandemic, Moderna has developed a new vaccine called mRNA-1018.On the other hand, a new, highly contagious variant of Covid-19 has surfaced in the US known as NB. 1.81. Initially detected in late March and early April among international travelers, cases have since been identified in New York, Ohio, California, Rhode Island, Hawaii, Washington State, and Virginia.Last year, the H5N1 bird flu virus spilled from wild birds into cattle and ended up infecting hundreds of animals across several states. 70 people reported sick with the flu, and one person died.Scientists have warned that continued alteration or evolution in the virus can make it more potent and ultimately lead to a pandemic.","The trump administration has slashed $766 million allocated in funding to moderna inc. moderna was tasked to make vaccines against potential pandemic influenza viruses, as well as the h5n1 bird flu.

Harmful effects of smartphone use





""Swap screen time for real time"" is the slogan used by the event management company's three Dutch founders, Ilya Kneppelhout, Jordy van Bennekom and Valentijn Klok.Their aim is to use The Offline Club to ""reconnect people with themselves and others through real-world communities and authentic, offline experiences.""For the past year, the three have organized meetups during which smartphones and laptops were not allowed. ""Are you ready to ditch your phone?"" they ask in a pinned reel on Instagram.Apparently, more and more people are willing to switch off their phones — at least for these organized events.Instead of taking their smartphones out, people read, play games, do arts and crafts or relax for a few hours. Workshops, called Digital Detox Retreats, take several days.""We envision a world in which phone-free spaces and offline communities are the norm,"" the three founders write on their website.The Dutch concept has been spreading worldwide over the last year. Amsterdam was one of the first locations, then came London, Paris, Milan and Copenhagen.Berlin has also hosted the first meetings of this kind. Also, a growing number of restaurants and clubs have been asking their guests to leave cell phones at home.The Dutch founders seem to have struck a nerve. After all, young people in particular often find it difficult to switch off their smartphones despite having all the settings that could limit their usage time.Even the return of the ""boring phone"" without apps has not been able to seriously displace smartphones, despite being celebrated on social networks.According to figures by the German industry association Bitkom from the end of 2024, people aged 16-29 spend more than three hours per day on their smartphones. That is the highest usage time of all age groups, and the actual duration is probably even longer.Yet, a large number of young people would like to spend significantly less time on their smartphones.According to a new survey by the British Standards Institution, almost 70% of the 1,293 people aged 16-21 feel worse when they spend time on social media. Half would be in favor of a ""digital curfew"" that would restrict access to certain apps and websites after 10 p.m. Around 46% even stated that they would have preferred to be young in a world without the internet.These results align with other surveys, such as the one Harris Poll, an American polling institute, conducted in late 2024. In that survey, many young people wished that TikTok, Instagram or X had never been invented.On Tuesday, British Technology Minister Peter Kyle hinted at considering mandatory curfews, according to The Guardian newspaper.Norway wants to raise the age limit for the use of social media from 13 to 15.As a global pioneer, Australia already raised the age limit to 16 in late 2024. Other countries, such as Denmark, ban tablets and smartphones almost entirely from schoolyards. In 2024, Danish Education Minister Mattias Tesfaye said the country had been naive in its approach to digitalization.Excessive smartphone use is further associated with various mental health problems such as depression, anxiety, stress, sleep disorders and addictive behavior.A study published in the journal BMC Medicine earlier this year found that depressive symptoms decreased by 27% after three weeks of reduced smartphone use.According to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, young people's mental health has deteriorated dramatically over the past 15 years. This trend was further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, when digital media was increasingly used. However, the OECD also stated that research has not yet been able to prove any direct causality between those two factors.The founders of the Dutch Offline Club want to take action and expand their meetups. Offline events are increasingly happening in different cities.In early April, over 1,000 people switched off their phones and smiled happily into the camera in London. This marks a new record, the offline influencers proudly declared — on Instagram, of course.","Dutch founders of the offline club want to ""reconnect people through real-world communities"" people read, play games, do arts and crafts or relax for a few hours.

European companies are cutting costs and scaling back investment plans in China as its economy slows and fierce competition drives down prices, according to an annual survey released Wednesday. Their challenges reflect broader ones faced by a Chinese economy hobbled by a prolonged real estate crisis that has hurt consumer spending. Beijing also faces growing pushback from Europe and the United States over surging exports.""The picture has deteriorated across many key metrics,"" the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said in the introduction to its Business Confidence Survey 2025.The same forces that are driving up Chinese exports are depressing the business outlook in the Chinese market. Chinese companies, often enticed by government subsidies, have invested so much in targeted industries such as electric vehicles that factory capacity far outpaces demand.The overcapacity has resulted in fierce price wars that cut into profits and a parallel push by companies into overseas markets.In Europe, that has created fears that growing imports from China could undermine its own factories and the workers they employ.The EU slapped tariffs on Chinese EVs last year, saying China had unfairly subsidised electric vehicle production.""I think there's a clear perception that the benefits of the bilateral trade and investment relationship are not being distributed in an equitable manner,"" Jens Eskelund, the president of the EU Chamber in China, told reporters earlier this week.He applauded efforts by China to boost consumer spending but said the government must also take steps to ensure that supply growth doesn't outpace that in demand.The survey results show that the downward pressure on profits increased over the past year and that a fall in business confidence has yet to bottom out, Eskelund said. About 500 member companies responded to the survey between mid-January to mid-February.""It is just very difficult for everyone right now in an environment of declining margins,"" he said.","European companies are cutting costs and scaling back investment plans in china.

In a first-of-its-kind event, humanoid robots took center stage in a kickboxing match in Hangzhou, China. The competition, part of the China Media Group (CMG) World Robot Competition – Mecha Fighting Series, was held on May 25 and marked the debut of robotic fighters in a full-fledged combat sport.The robots were developed by Unitree Robotics, a Chinese tech company known for its advanced humanoid machines. Four Unitree G1 robots took part in the fight, each about 132 centimeters tall and weighing 35 kilograms, reported Asia Times.They were remotely controlled by human trainers using joysticks, and the match was broadcasted by China Central Television (CCTV).While the event sparked excitement among viewers, one social media user commented humorously, “The part that confuses me most is the referee in the ring.”Videos from the match showed the robots exchanging punches and kicks with surprising coordination. Although the strikes were more like soft pushes than real hits, the movements displayed impressive balance and speed for machines.The match was part of a larger effort to test and showcase the growing abilities of AI and robotics in dynamic settings.Earlier this year, a Unitree robot was seen in a viral video aggressively reacting to its handlers during a demo, raising safety concerns.In another case, during February’s Spring Festival Gala in Tianjin, a robot reportedly charged toward a crowd, alarming attendees.Such incidents, including a recent case at Tesla's factory in Texas where a robot allegedly injured a worker, have sparked growing concern over AI safety and the potential risks of advanced robotics. Experts have pointed to software glitches and inadequate testing as common causes, highlighting the need for strict quality control in AI development.","Humanoid robots took center stage in a kickboxing match in hangzhou, china.

Gabon's capital Libreville was without electricity for several hours Wednesday following a ""major technical incident"", the national energy supplier said.The early morning power outage ""resulted in the loss of all production facilities in the Libreville Interconnected Network (RIC)"", the Gabonese Water and Energy Company (SEEG) said without giving further details.SEEG said it had managed to restore power to around half of its customers in the capital ""by early morning"", adding its teams were working to find and analyse the fault, which AFP reporters said also cut internet and mobile phone coverage.On Monday, the Gabonese presidency had announced the end of an interim administration of SEEG started in August on the back of a slew of supply cuts.As of Wednesday, ""management of SEEG will be fully transferred"" and it will return to its majority shareholder, the Gabonese Strategic Investment Fund (FGIS), the company stated.For several months last year, electricity supply was disrupted due to significant infrastructure problems.A rotating load shedding system was established leading to supply cuts in entire neighbourhoods for hours at a time, to enable power supply for other parts of the city.A protocol signed between the Gabonese government and Turkish firm Karpowership for supply of 70 megawatts via two floating power plants to cover greater Libreville saw the situation improve in recent months.Revamping the network is a top priority for Gabon's leader Brice Oligui Nguema, a general who overthrew the Bongo dynasty and won 94.85 percent of the vote in April's election, 19 months on from his August 2023 coup.Earlier this month he vowed to provide ""universal access"" to drinking water and electricity.","Gabon's capital libreville was without electricity for several hours wednesday following a ""major technical incident"" the early morning power outage ""resulted in the loss of all production facilities in the libreville interconnected network (ric),"" the gabonese water and energy company said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121467041,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-14734,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
