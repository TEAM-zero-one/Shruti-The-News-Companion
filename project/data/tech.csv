What does Tata Motors demerger mean for investors?

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Tata Motors demerger: Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, compared to Monday's closing price of Rs 660.90. This is a notional decline in Tata Motors' share price post its demerger, according to an ET report.This adjustment occurred as the shares commenced trading ex-demerger value following the division of its commercial vehicles operations into a separate listed company. The reduction corresponds to the commercial vehicle division's removal from the parent company's valuation.October 14 is the record date for the company's division into Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV) and Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles Ltd (TMLCV). Investors holding shares through October 13 will be allocated one TMLCV share for each Tata Motors share owned.The company will adopt the name Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV), comprising passenger vehicles, electric vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) units. TMLCV shares will be transferred to demat accounts within 30-45 days, followed by independent listing on the NSE and BSE after securing regulatory clearances.The existing F&O contracts due in October, November and December were concluded on Monday, with new contracts featuring adjusted lot sizes introduced from today.Financial experts anticipate the separation to enhance value assessment and business specialisation.SBI Securities indicates that the division ""enables clearer valuation of the company's distinct businesses."" They forecast TMPV, generating 87% of revenue from JLR, to be valued between Rs 285 and Rs 384 following the split, with growth prospects tied to JLR's operational improvements.For TMLCV, SBI Securities estimates a valuation range of Rs 320-470, highlighting its forthcoming €3.8 billion purchase of Iveco Group NV's commercial vehicle division, which should triple combined turnover and strengthen presence in electric and alternative fuel technologies. ""The integration of Iveco Group NV, most likely in FY27, will expose the company to the global CV cycle,"" they note, whilst cautioning about temporary margin reduction due to Iveco's lower EBIT performance.YES Securities views the separation as a ""value unlocking opportunity,"" observing that standalone passenger and commercial vehicle operations will enable targeted investment in specific automotive sectors.Brokerages say the demerger allows for a clearer valuation of Tata Motors’ separate businesses. “Overall, we expect value creation, as the commercial vehicles (CV) business is likely to trade at around 11 times EV/EBITDA on a FY27 basis, which translates to roughly Rs 300, in line with comparable peers,” said Pankaj Pandey of ICICI Securities, as quoted by Economic Times.“For the passenger vehicles (PV) segment, we estimate a fair value in the range of Rs 450 to 500. Since this is a vertical split, one of the most anticipated demergers, we believe there should be value creation, as the PV and CV businesses are poised for distinct growth trajectories,” Pandey added.According to Bonanza Research Analyst Khushi Mistry, the division ""will lead to sharper business focus for both entities."" TMLCV debuts as India's premier commercial vehicle manufacturer, commanding 37.1% market share and achieving 12.2% EBITDA margin in Q1FY26, despite reduced revenue. TMPV anticipates 8-10% growth in H2FY26, driven by product launches, strong SUV market position, and increasing EV and CNG adoption, representing 45% of its passenger vehicle earnings.Following a September cyberattack, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), the UK subsidiary of Tata Motors, initiated phased manufacturing operations on October 8. Khushi Mistry reported that wholesale volumes decreased by 24% while retail sales fell 17% in the September quarter, resulting in estimated weekly losses of £50 million. ""Full production is expected to resume post-Christmas due to the scale of restoration needed,"" she stated.YES Securities assessed that ""2QFY26 JLR dispatches (-24% YoY and QoQ) were impacted by production losses due to the cyberattack from early Sep'25. However, the retail-level impact was much lower. We expect volumes to gradually improve in 3Q and 4Q, which should support sentiment.""The share distribution plan allocates one TMLCV share per Tata Motors share owned. Details regarding acquisition costs for both entities will be provided subsequently to facilitate portfolio and tax calculations.Share price fluctuations are anticipated during the structural transition period. Industry analysts indicate that future performance will be determined by JLR's production recovery and TMLCV's operational success following the Iveco integration.The investment community remains focused on whether the corporate separation will boost Tata Motors' share performance or if value enhancement will require a longer timeline.","Tata motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on tuesday, with shares opening at rs 399 on the bombay stock exchange. This is a notional decline in tata motors' share price post its demerger. The reduction corresponds to the commercial vehicle division's removal from the parent company's valuation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124545008,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-73848,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Ranking criteria



Battle

prowess and combat

Each Mega Evolution's ranking in this tier list emphasizes its offensive and defensive capabilities in battles. Accordingly, their base stats were evaluated, alongside their type advatanges, their movepool, and overall damage output. Megas with better type coverage, damage metrics, and versatility received higher rankings.

Availability and accessibility

Another essential factor for ranking the Mega Evolutions in Pokemon Legends: Z-A was the ease of obtaining them. Megas available earlier in the game or through common Pokemon receive higher rankings than those requiring late-game progression or rare encounters. This ensures that you actually end up using the Megas during your playthrough.

Typing

Lastly, the strategic value of each Mega's typing combination and the roles it can fulfill within team compositions affects this ranking. The Evolutions that offer better coverage options, defensive typing, or filling team gaps receive a higher position. In the meantime, those Pokemon with limited strategic flexibility rank lower.

Pokemon Legends: Z-A is finally here, and it has resulted in the introduction of several new Mega Evolutions. From classics like Starmie to legendary ones like Zygarde, these Mega Evolutions are unique and add a lot of depth to the game.In this article, we provide you with a tier list, ranking the different Mega Evolutions in Pokemon Legends: Z-A.

Jason Kelce shuts down fake quotes about Bad Bunny but makes a factual error

Fans react to Jason Kelce’s “honest mistake” and defend his intentions





Jason Kelce, one of the NFL ’s most beloved figures, recently found himself in an unexpected online storm after addressing a series of fake quotes falsely attributed to him. While his intention was to set the record straight, fans quickly noticed that his clarification included an embarrassing slip, one that sparked a new wave of reactions on social media.The controversy began when a fabricated quote started circulating online, claiming Kelce had commented on Bad Bunny’s upcoming 2026 Super Bowl halftime show. The viral fake quote read: “If Bad Bunny is a bad fit for the Super Bowl, then maybe the people making these comments are a bad fit for America’s future.”Kelce swiftly took to X (formerly Twitter) to clarify, writing, “I normally don’t comment on things like this, but I feel I need to address that there are several accounts posting fake quotes and attributing them to me on this platform right now.”He went on to thank the social platform’s community feature for helping identify misinformation: “I appreciate @X putting community notes on several, and I will not address the other accounts specifically, because I do not want to amplify their engagement. But please know, unless you hear something directly from me via one of my platforms, it is not real.”However, sharp-eyed users were quick to correct Kelce, noting that community notes are not issued by X itself but rather by users who volunteer to fact-check content.Fans pointed out the irony of Kelce unintentionally spreading misinformation while calling it out, turning the clarification into an even bigger talking point.Despite the blunder, fans rallied around the retired Eagles legend. “At least he’s trying to fight fake news — can’t say that about many athletes,” one fan commented. Another joked, “Jason just community-noted himself, and I kinda love that energy.”Others saw humor in the situation, posting memes about how quickly misinformation spreads, even among those trying to stop it. Still, most agreed Kelce’s response reflected his integrity and transparency.As one fan summed it up: “Jason may have misspoken, but at least he’s showing accountability. That’s more than most public figures do.”Also Read: “Any referee that you see on Sunday is..."": Cam Newton’s no-nonsense take on fixing bad officiating could change how the NFL runs games forever With Kelce now working as an ESPN analyst, this episode reminds fans that even the most respected voices in sports can find themselves tangled in the messy web of online misinformation.","Nfl star jason kelce inadvertently sparked a new online buzz after correcting fake quotes attributed to him.

Shae Cornette emerges as confident and dynamic new host of ESPN’s First Take

First Take

Shae Cornette steps in as versatile anchor for ESPN’s high-energy show

Molly Qerim's successor on First Take has been signed by ESPN. The network told Front Office Sports that Shae Cornette and Stephen A. Smith would be hosting. Cornette was selected by the network to take Qerim's place on ""First Take"" following a month-long audition process, Front Office Sports announced Thursday. On November 3, Cornette will formally take over as host of First Take. Smith is one of the network's highest-paid performers. He will therefore probably need to approve the final decision.Molly Qerim abruptly quit First Take last month, and several of her coworkers and an ESPN executive speculated that it had something to do with contract negotiations and her future at the network. However, after testing out a few presenters, the Worldwide Leader has reportedly chosen a substitute for Qerim: Shea Peppler Cornette.After presenting the morning discussion program for over ten years, Qerim left it last month. Cornette, Peter Schrager, Amina Smith, MJ Acosta, Courtney Cronin, and Joe Fortenbaugh are among the hosts that ESPN has since tried out for the position.Cornette has hosted radio and television programs, including SportsCenter, since joining ESPN in 2020. ESPN and Cornette have not yet released an official statement, though. David Roberts, the executive vice president of ESPN, told FOS:“Shae is meticulous in her preparations, connects naturally with our show’s high-profile personalities, and has a unique ability to keep lively debate engaging and on point..Her professionalism, presence and energy make her an ideal fit for First Take and a great addition to one of ESPN’s most successful franchises.”ESPN president of content Burke Magnus told media reporter Richard Deitsch last month that Qerim's departure from First Take came sooner than anticipated. In the announcement, Qerim wrote:“After much reflection, I’ve decided it’s time to close this incredible chapter and step away from.. Hosting this show has been one of the greatest honors of my career. Every morning, I had the privilege of sharing the desk with some of the most brilliant, passionate, and entertaining voices in sports — and with all of you, the best fans in the world…”She further stated:“I’m so grateful for what this journey has given me: lifelong friendships, unforgettable memories, and the chance to be part of something truly special. From the bottom of my heart, thank you for welcoming me into your homes.”Meanwhile, Shae Cornette seems perfect for the new role.Following rumors that she would be retiring at the end of the year, Qerim abruptly left the program. Smith, who earns $20 million annually, is one of the network's highest-paid performers. He is also the executive producer of the venerable ""Embrace Debate"" program.He will thus likely need to sanction the ultimate decision. Having worked for Chicago media for decades, such as ABC 7, Fox 32, and ESPN 1000, Cornette came to ESPN in 2020. She has worked as a SportsCenter anchor and studio host for both TV and radio at ESPN on a regular basis.The morning program, launched in 2003 as Cold Pizza, was reformatted in 2011 as First Take, hosted by Skip Bayless . Smith joined as a regular cast member in 2012. Qerim took over hosting First Take then. However, the new chapter for the show is about to begin as the new host prepares herself for the role.Also read: Stephen A.

“The (second) question is with the release of 1% workforce, the headcount declined by 20,000 people or 3%. And what you had announced earlier was 2%. So should we expect a similar kind of head count reduction in the next quarter as well?”

“So almost -- see, the 20,000 head count is a factor of voluntary and involuntary attrition.

So you should see that. But as we announced, against the 2 percentage, we have midway, so we have done approximately 1 percentage of it. And like what Krithi just mentioned, we don't have a target.”

“We are not chasing a target. We'll continue to evaluate everyone after all the investment in learning and development that we've done…..” he continued.

AI’s real value lies ahead







Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu is the next to join the ongoing ‘AI bubble’ debate. Vembu has issued a cautionary warning on the present surge in artificial intelligence investments. He described the market as a ‘financial bubble’ that could distort long-term innovation. In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Vembu said that while AI holds enormous promise, the present wave of huge valuations and funding practices are becoming a cause on concern. “This boom makes me very uncomfortable,” he said. “While AI as a technology has enormous promise, much of today’s investment is speculative.”Along with this, Vembu also pointed to a round-tripping which a financial manoeuvre where companies fund each other to inflate revenue. This practice as per Vembu is a troubling trend for the AI sector. He further warned that such practices could lead to unsustainable valuations which is smilier to the past bubbles in dotcom and e-commerce. “Some people argue the multi-trillion-dollar valuations will be justified by productivity gains. But why aren’t those gains visible already?” he asked.However, despite all these concerns, Vembu stressed on the fact that the underlying technology of AI remains valuable and will continue to deliver real benefits in the long term.He advocates for measured, purpose-driven investment rather than hype-fueled speculation. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos may have agreed with Sam Altman over ‘AI Bubble’ warningRecently, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos also pointed out that the current surge of investment in artificial intelligence (AI) constitutes an “industrial bubble” but stressed that the underlying technology is ""real"" and will bring immense societal benefits. Similar comments have been previously made by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman who reportedly said earlier this year that he believes AI could be in a bubble but it’s “the most important thing to happen in a very long time”.“This is a kind of industrial bubble,” the Amazon founder said while speaking at Italian Tech Week.“The second thing that happens is that people get very excited like they are today about artificial intelligence,” Bezos added, noting that when they happen, stock prices are “disconnected from the fundamentals” of a business. He said that during bubbles, every experiment or idea gets funded.“The good ideas and the bad ideas. And investors have a hard time in the middle of this excitement, distinguishing between the good ideas and the bad ideas. And that’s also probably happening today,” Bezos said.","Zoho founder sridhar vembu has issued a cautionary warning on the present surge in artificial intelligence investments.

Sony PlayStation Network experienced a temporary outage earlier today, affecting thousands of users across the United States. Reports on DownDetector, a platform that tracks online service disruptions, indicated that over 11,000 users faced issues, primarily related to server connectivity. Users in the United States received ‘service busy’ message while accessing the platform. Problems were also detected with logging in and in carrying out PNS-related social media activities.Now, according to PlayStation Network Service Status, all services have now been restored. “All services are up and running,” the status page reads, including account management, gaming and social and PlayStation Store.As of now, there is no official statement from Sony about what caused the outage.The outage, which lasted for roughly an hour, impacted users in major cities including New York, Chicago, Washington, Atlanta, and Tampa. Many players reported problems logging in and using PlayStation Network’s social features during the downtime.Expressing frustration, one user wrote in the comment section of Downdetector: “Is it even worth it? Is it even worth it to wake up, eat, go to work, eat, sleep, repeat, for the rest of our lives? There's gotta be more to life than this.

“Your ability to manage a hybrid team of human and AI resources will play an essential role in the success of the company’s employees.""

4 tips Marco Argenti shared with Goldman Sachs' employees



“get creative with AI, posing provocative, non-obvious questions.”

“While AI excels at refurbishing existing knowledge its true creative potential is unlocked by human curiosity,""

“The expert will curate a personal toolkit of models and assistants and know[s] which one to deploy for which task,"" he explained

“plausible-sounding errors.”

“A blend of deep knowledge and a detective’s scepticism,”





Goldman Sachs chief information officer (CIO) Marco Argenti believes professionals can succeed in the AI-driven workplace by focusing on collaboration and questioning rather than competing with machines. In a recent company Briefings newsletter (as seen by Fortune), Argenti outlined four strategies on how employees canas autonomous systems take on tasks previously reserved for humans. Argenti's advice centres on adapting to the AI transition by learning how to conduct, question, and collaborate with the new technology. This approach is intended to help professionals thrive as AI reshapes workplaces globally. In the newsletter, Argenti wrote:Argenti suggests that today’s professionals need to shift from simply executing tasks to coordinating them. Success, he explains, will depend less on individual output, such as writing code or performing analysis and more on managing agile teams composed of both human and AI contributors. Effective leadership will involve delegating, coordinating, and integrating their work to achieve outcomes that neither could reach alone.According to Argenti, curiosity is one of the most valuable human abilities in an AI-driven world. He encourages employees toWhile AI systems are strong at processing existing information, they rely on human curiosity to spark new ideas. By asking imaginative, unconventional questions, people can help AI move beyond familiar patterns and reveal deeper insights.Argenti wrote.Argenti also recommends that professionals use a mix of AI tools tailored to specific tasks rather than relying on a single platform. No one model performs best in every situation, he notes. The advantage lies in understanding which tools are most effective for particular purposes, such as data analysis, writing, or coding and combining them into a personalised digital toolkit.Argenti further warns that even advanced AI systems can generateAs these tools become more integrated into work processes, checking their accuracy will require domain expertise and careful evaluation.he writes, will help distinguish reliable insights from misleading ones.Argenti concludes that AI is not replacing human ability but changing how it is defined.

"Milestone for AI in science: Google AI generates cancer hypothesis later validated by scientists, says Sundar Pichai",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/milestone-for-ai-in-science-google-ai-generates-cancer-hypothesis-later-validated-by-scientists-says-sundar-pichai/articleshow/124599530.cms,"

How Google AI is decoding cancer through cellular language



Discovery of a potential cancer therapy pathway



Transforming scientific discovery



Open access for global collaboration





In a significant development for AI in biomedical research, Google ’s C2S-Scale 27B foundation model, developed in collaboration with Yale University and based on the Gemma framework, has successfully generated a novel hypothesis about cancer cell behaviour. This hypothesis was later experimentally validated in living human cells, marking an important step forward in the integration of artificial intelligence with laboratory science.Google CEO Sundar Pichai hailed the development as a major advance in the partnership between AI and laboratory science. He emphasised that the discovery could guide future preclinical and clinical research, potentially revealing new pathways for cancer therapy.At the core of this achievement is the C2S-Scale 27B model’s exceptional capacity to ""understand"" biology. The AI system was trained on over one billion single-cell profiles and transforms raw molecular data into what researchers call “cell sentences.” With this approach, the AI can interpret cellular communication and context, essentially learning the “language” of cells.As biotech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson explained, the model “listened” to what cells were signalling and produced a hypothesis that real biological experiments later confirmed.This fluency in cellular patterns marks a turning point for AI’s role in biomedical discovery, enabling it to reason about complex systems and propose new ideas rather than simply summarising existing knowledge.The C2S-Scale 27B model produced a hypothesis suggesting that the drug silmitasertib could significantly boost antigen presentation in cancer cells by almost 50% under conditions of low interferon. Antigen presentation is the process by which tumour cells display fragments of abnormal proteins on their surface, signalling the immune system to recognise and attack them. By enhancing this mechanism, silmitasertib could make previously “invisible” tumours detectable to immune cells, strengthening the body’s own ability to fight cancer.Experiments conducted in human cell models confirmed the AI’s prediction. This finding is particularly promising for tackling “cold tumours,” a type of cancer known for bypassing immune detection and resisting conventional therapies. If these results are validated in further preclinical and clinical studies, they could open the door to new immunotherapy approaches, offering fresh hope for patients with cancers that are notoriously difficult to treat.This milestone represents a turning point in how AI can contribute to medical research. Rather than merely analysing existing datasets, AI systems like C2S-Scale 27B are now capable of generating entirely new scientific hypotheses, bridging the gap between computational prediction and experimental validation. Researchers emphasise that extensive preclinical and clinical testing is still essential before these AI-driven insights can translate into viable treatments for patients.Even so, this achievement demonstrates the transformative potential of AI as a true partner in science, capable of accelerating discovery, sparking innovation, and guiding research in ways that were previously unimaginable.In an effort to democratise cutting-edge biomedical research, Google has made the C2S-Scale model publicly available on platforms such as Hugging Face and GitHub. This transparency allows scientists worldwide to explore the model’s capabilities, test its predictions, and build upon its foundation.","Google’s c2s-scale 27b foundation model has successfully generated a novel hypothesis about cancer cell behaviour.

In a major stride toward digital government transformation, the UAE’s Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) has introduced an artificial intelligence-based system named 'Eye'. Announced at GITEX Global 2025, the system aims to revolutionise the way work permits are issued by reducing bureaucracy, improving efficiency, and eliminating human error through automated document verification.The ‘Eye’ system, developed and deployed by MoHRE, is designed to automate the entire work permit application process by integrating an advanced AI Agent. This agent is capable of verifying critical documents such as:By cross-checking and validating the authenticity and accuracy of each document, the system reduces the dependency on human staff to process applications. Manual intervention will only be required in exceptional cases, as the system is built to handle most scenarios autonomously.According to MoHRE, this marks a ""significant advancement in accelerating work permit issuance"" and aligns with the UAE’s broader efforts to digitise government operations and improve service delivery.Rashid Hassan Al Saadi, Acting Assistant Undersecretary for Labour Market Services at MoHRE, described the initiative as a milestone in digital innovation. He emphasised that:The introduction of ‘Eye’ supports the UAE government’s long-standing push to streamline administrative procedures.In June 2024, the UAE expanded an initiative to reduce the processing time for residency visas and work permits from 30 days to just 5 days.Additionally, the rollout of ‘Eye’ is part of a larger policy framework inspired by the Zero Government Bureaucracy programme, launched by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai. In this initiative, the government committed to eliminating 2,000 unnecessary procedures within a year. As of June this year, service delivery time had already been reduced by over 70% in its first phase.MoHRE currently issues 13 types of work permits, depending on the nature of the job and the sector of employment. These permits are legally required for any individual who wishes to work in the UAE. According to UAE Labour Law:To apply for a work permit, applicants must submit:The 'Eye' system aims to digitise and accelerate verification of all these documents, thereby speeding up approvals and reducing errors that might delay application processing.Beyond the launch of ‘Eye’, MoHRE showcased several other technology-driven initiatives at GITEX Global 2025, reflecting its ongoing commitment to digital transformation. These include:These initiatives are aligned with the UAE Government’s broader vision of leading globally in AI adoption and ensuring an efficient, agile, and business-friendly regulatory environment.","The uae's ai-powered 'eye' system speeds up work permit approvals by automating document checks, reducing errors, and cutting wait times.

What is the new parole fee?





The $1,000 parole fee applies to all aliens granted parole under INA Section 212(d)(5)(A), including initial parole, re-parole, parole in place, or parole from DHS custody, unless they qualify for one of ten statutory exemptions.sThis new fee was mandated by the One Big Beautiful Bill. The fee is “in addition” to any other existing USCIS filing or biometric fee; it does not replace them. The parole will not be granted until the fee is paid as instructed and within the time. The fee is not to be paid when the applicant submits Form I-131. The USCIS will notify the applicants if the parole being granted requires payment. The fee will be collected by the three DHS components responsible for parole decisions: U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS).

Who are exempt from the new parole fee





Those who are already in the US and not being newly paroled in. Those who are granted parole to serve as witnesses, informants or cooperate with investigations. USCIS or CBP can waive the fee for very limited urgent medical or life-saving reasons (like immediate medical evacuation or protection from imminent danger).





The US Citizenship and Immigration Services has notified the new immigration parole fee of $1,000 required from now on for certain types of migrants.

Told students I was more likely to be elected Pope than win Nobel: Mokyr





Stockholm: Three researchers who probed the process of business innovation won the Nobel Prize in economics Monday for explaining how new products and inventions promote economic growth and human welfare, even as they leave older companies in the dust. Their work was credited with helping economists better understand how ideas and technology succeed by disrupting established ways - a process as old as steam locomotives replacing horse-drawn wagons and as contemporary as e-commerce shuttering shopping malls.Joel Mokyr, 79, is at Northwestern University; Philippe Aghion, 69, works at College de France and London School of Economics; and Peter Howitt, 79, is at Brown University.The winners were credited with better explaining and quantifying ""creative destruction"", a key concept in economics that refers to the process in which beneficial new innovations replace - and thus destroy - older technologies and businesses. Examples of creative destruction include e-commerce disrupting retail, streaming services replacing videocassette and DVD rentals and internet advertising undermining newspaper advertising.agenciesThe concept is usually associated with economist Joseph Schumpeter, who outlined it in his 1942 book 'Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy'. Schumpeter called the concept ""the essential fact about capitalism"". The Nobel committee said Mokyr ""demonstrated that if innovations are to succeed one another in a self-generating process, we not only need to know that something works, but we also need to have scientific explanations for why"".Aghion and Howitt studied the mechanisms behind sustained growth, including in a 1992 article that offered a complex mathematical model for creative destruction that added new aspects not included in earlier models. ""The laureates' work shows that economic growth cannot be taken for granted. We must uphold the mechanisms that underlie creative destruction, so that we do not fall back into stagnation,"" said John Hassler, chair of the committee for the prize in economic sciences.Mokyr has long been known as an optimist about recent technological innovation. About a decade ago, many economists argued that inventions such as smartphones or even the internet had less of an economic impact than previous developments such as the airplane or the car. Mokyr responded that as new services were either cheap or free, their impact wasn't evident in economic data, but they provided enormous benefits.Mokyr said he was shocked to win the prize. "" I had no clue that anything like this was going to happen,"" he said. His students had asked him about the possibility he would win the Nobel, he said.
