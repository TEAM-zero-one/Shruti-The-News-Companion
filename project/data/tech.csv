India gets its first privately funded institute for maths research,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-gets-its-first-privately-funded-institute-for-maths-research/articleshow/123352435.cms,"Representational Image

MUMBAI: India, said Fields medallist Manjul Bhargava, must fall in love with mathematics again. Not as a ""drudgery of formulae"" but as an act of ""exploration"".Bhargava, Canadian by nationality but of Indian origin, believes classrooms need an overhaul-""experimental, playful,"" he said, with teachers ""trained"" to spark curiosity. Speaking to TOI on the sidelines of the launch of the Lodha Mathematical Sciences Institute (LMSI), he added: ""I'm happy with the new textbooks and the changes brought in them. But they will only show impact in a few years.""On the scientific advisory council of LMSI, Bhargava will lead sessions on arithmetic statistics, its new developments, and future directions. State cabinet minister Mangal Prabhat Lodha called it a school ""not for an individual, not for a business, but for the nation that always prioritised knowledge over all and for India that gave so much math to the world.""Entirely devoted to post-doctoral research, LMSI is India's first privately funded mathematics institute, backed by Lodha Foundation with a Rs 20,000 crore endowment. ""We realised that for any nation to become strong, we ought to have original thinking and promote innovation,"" said Abhishek Lodha, CEO and MD of Lodha Developers. The privately funded mathematics research institute in the country is completely free, he added.Founding director V Kumar Murthy-who earlier led Toronto's Fields Institute-described math as the hidden scaffolding of modern life: the foundation for finance, engineering, and technology. Economist Nachiket Mor, also on the advisory panel, noted that models built in the West often collapse in India because they rarely account for ""unique characteristics"" like limited liquidity and higher viscosity of adjustment. ""This reality makes it all the more urgent for us to build deep capacity mathematics,"" he said.Murthy explained that LMSI would begin not with students but with teachers. Ten senior number theorists have been chosen to seed the effort. As president, Murthy said he plans to travel across the country, meeting mathematicians firsthand and mapping who is doing what. The aim is to build a network where the ""brightest minds"" are spotted early, handpicked, and nurtured.By Dec 2026, LMSI will host the first Indian Congress of Mathematicians, showcasing contributions of Indian-origin mathematicians worldwide.","Fields medallist manjul bhargava says india must fall in love with mathematics again.

MUMBAI: Simone Tata, the mother of Tata Trusts chairman Noel Tata, is in critical condition at the Breach Candy Hospital, sources with direct knowledge of the matter told TOI.She was airlifted from Dubai to Mumbai on Monday and is under the care of doctor Farokh Udwadia.Simone, 95, is fighting several symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, the same illness that her stepson and former Tata Group chairman Ratan Tata passed away from last October.“She and Noel arrived in Mumbai from Dubai on a medical plane at Terminal 8,” the sources said.Simone is most famous for turning the Lakmé cosmetic brand into a well-known household name in India. The name Lakmé comes from the French word for Lakshmi, a goddess known for her beauty in Hindu mythology.The Tata Group was urged by former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to launch a makeup brand after learning that Indian women were spending the country’s foreign reserves on Western makeup brands. Lakmé was established by the Tata Group in 1952.Originally from Geneva, Switzerland, Simone first visited India as a tourist in the summer of 1953 at the age of 23. During her visit, she met Naval Tata, who was 26 years her senior and divorced from his first wife Soonoo.They fell in love, got married in 1955, and she decided to make Mumbai her permanent home.In 1996, the Tata Group sold Lakmé to Hindustan Unilever as part of a restructuring strategy. Simone used the proceeds from the sale to create Westside, a popular department store where many Indians shop.She managed the Tata Group’s consumer-facing businesses including Lakme and Trent (which owns Westside and Star India Bazaar stores) for over four decades until her retirement in 2006. She also served on the board of Tata Industries, an important investment company within the Tata Group.After her retirement, Simone made fewer public appearances. In October 2019, she was seen in a wheelchair at the opening of the renovated flagship Westside store in South Mumbai. In September 2022, she attended the funeral of former Tata Group chairman Cyrus Mistry (Noel is married to Cyrus’s sister Aloo Mistry), and in October 2024, she was present at Ratan’s funeral.Following Ratan’s passing, Noel took over his position at Tata Trusts, the driving force behind the $180-billion Tata Group.","Simone tata, the mother of tata trusts chairman noel tata, is in critical condition.

GPT-5 Unlocked: From College Student to PhD Expert!

Parag Agrawal , former CEO of Twitter, has embarked on a new chapter in his tech journey, after the public dismantling of Twitter and its transformation into X under Elon Musk . He’s now at the helm of Parallel Web Systems , an AI startup that aims to change how AI agents perform real-world tasks for humans on a computer, acting much like a digital assistant. According to a report by Bloomberg, following his unceremonious firing by Tesla CEO, his friends and former colleagues urged him to take a much-needed break from the intense Twitter saga, but Agrawal chose a different path.“I’m not a person that can enjoy the beach in that moment,” Agrawal shared, showing his immediate drive to build anew. He immersed himself in intense meetings at a Palo Alto coffee shop, delving into research papers, writing code and creating the startup from his laptop.Agrawal said that he received numerous job offers but most were uninspiring, asking him to “clean up shit,” as he put it. With his extensive background in building machine learning systems at Twitter, Agrawal was convinced his next venture had to be in AI.He said that just a month after his departure from Twitter, OpenAI launched ChatGPT , opening opportunities for artificial intelligence startups, with companies like Anthropic PBC rapidly expanding.Parallel Web Systems is developing infrastructure that empowers AI agents—think of them as smart tools capable of handling complex computer tasks on your behalf. The core of Parallel's innovation lies in helping these AI agents efficiently search the web for the most accurate information.This capability is often the critical difference between an AI agent successfully completing a task and failing altogether, ensuring the tools can deliver on their promise.Agrawal's new endeavor has already garnered significant attention, successfully raising $30 million in funding. Notable investors include billionaire Vinod Khosla through his firm, Khosla Ventures . Agrawal now leads a 25-person team from a Palo Alto office, not far from where he first incorporated the company on his laptop.“I don’t think Twitter defines me. If I do a good job, I’m hoping this company will define me,” Agrawal says of his new role. Agrawal – a former International Physics Olympiad gold medalist with a doctorate in computer science from Stanford University – steadily climbed the ranks at Twitter over more than a decade.Starting as an engineer on the advertising team, he eventually rose to become Chief Technology Officer under then-CEO Jack Dorsey. His contributions included work on core products like Twitter’s initial advertising technology and its algorithmic timeline. He was appointed Dorsey's successor in late 2021.","Parag agrawal, former ceo of twitter, has embarked on a new chapter in his tech journey.

Sridhar Vembu , the co-founder and chief scientist of Zoho Corporation , has provided valuable insights into the evolving role of artificial intelligence (AI) in modern workplaces and business processes. He acknowledges AI’s immense potential to accelerate learning, streamline workflows, and enhance overall product and service experiences, making operations more efficient and data-driven. However, Vembu cautions that over-reliance on AI, misuse, or unmonitored implementation can reduce, or even reverse, the expected productivity gains, creating unforeseen challenges.His perspective underscores the critical importance of responsible AI adoption , emphasising human oversight, ethical considerations, and continuous evaluation of AI systems. By balancing technology with careful management, businesses can harness AI’s advantages while mitigating risks and ensuring sustainable growth.Vembu revealed his personal AI habits in a post on X (formerly Twitter) in August 2025, describing himself as a “moderate to heavy” user.A unique approach he follows is having multiple AI systems debate and critique each other’s outputs, which he believes enhances understanding and critical thinking.Vembu highlighted that AI can significantly enhance product experiences and improve customer service efficiency:Tools like Grok in X show how AI can streamline user interaction and provide quicker solutions.AI can support customer service agents, enabling faster responses and more efficient handling of queries.However, he warns against allowing AI to fully replace human agents. Passing off AI-generated responses as human without disclosure is unethical and risks damaging trust.Vembu emphasised that AI should assist rather than replace human creativity:He advises against using AI to create original content independently.Copying and pasting AI-generated responses without human review or disclosure is considered unprofessional.AI is a tool to augment human intelligence, not a substitute for critical thinking, creativity, or decision-making.Vembu also discussed AI in software development, pointing out potential risks and limitations:AI-generated code must undergo comprehensive compliance, privacy, and security reviews. Skipping these processes can undermine software quality, compromise security, and violate professional standards.In some instances, these verification steps may eliminate much of AI’s time-saving advantage, and improper use could even slow development.Zoho programmers are encouraged to use AI for learning and problem-solving, but not as a complete replacement for human coding judgement.Vembu’s philosophy focuses on moderation, experimentation, and evaluation:Use AI to enhance productivity, learning, and problem-solving, not as a full substitute for human expertise.Conduct experiments, gather real-world data, and refine AI practices based on outcomes.Ensure human oversight and ethical responsibility in all AI-driven processes.This approach ensures AI serves as a complement to human skill, fostering innovation while maintaining accountability.","Sridhar vembu is the co-founder and chief scientist of zoho corporation.

GitHub CEO Thomas Dhomke recently revealed that he has made it clear that using the company’s platform is a mandatory part of the job for all employees. Speaking in a recent ‘Decoder’ podcast, the GitHub CEO said that it is clear that GitHub is non-negotiable for employees at the company. “There is no world where I would allow employees to say, ‘Well, sorry, I don’t want to use GitHub.’ If that is the case, you can go work somewhere else.” This rule of the company highlights GitHub’s commitment to its own platform which hosts more than 1 billion repositories and also serve more than 150 million developers globally.According to a report by Business Insider, during the recent podcast interview, Thomas Dohmke said that it is a rule at GitHub that all the employees will use the platform. The rule applies to everyone from developers to HR professionals. “There is no world where I would allow for somebody to say, 'Well, sorry, I don't want to use GitHub.'

Lava Blaze AMOLED 2: Budget Smartphone with Mid-Range Vibes

The ongoing dispute surrounding Nvidia’s H20 AI chip sales to China has now intensified discussions about US-China technology arms race . A recent online report revealed that China is pursuing its major tech companies like Alibaba and ByteDance to reconsider their orders for Nvidia’s H20 AI chips even as Chinese regulators have asked tech firms to explain why they are purchasing Nvidia’s chips – which US President Donald Trump called ‘obsolete’ – instead of using domestic alternatives, suggesting that they want the Chinese tech companies to downsize their orders of H20 chips.Following this ongoing controversy, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a blunt warning about America’s vulnerability in the global tech arms race. As reported by Financial Review, speaking at the Reagan National Economic Forum, Dimon called it “a little embarrassing” that the U.S. allowed 100% of its penicillin supply and critical tech components to come from China. “It’s a little embarrassing that we as a nation allowed 100% of our penicillin to come from China, and all of our rare earths, and all of our advanced chipmaking tools,” Dimon said. “We need to get our act together.”On being asked about the technology arms race between US and China, Jamie Dimon mentioned that it was an important miliarty issue as US cannot allow the sale of a chip to China which is designed to make powerful AI systems.Dimon also talked about the dependence of America on foreign nations for essential goods and technology. ""It’s a little embarrassing that we as a nation allowed 100 per cent of our Penicillin to come from China, and all of the rare earth [metals],"" Dimon said.Talking about the ongoing chip dispute, Dimon added that “You don’t want to give them the chips which will make their supersonic missiles better.”Dimon also emphasised that America cannot stop China but can definitely slow them down. “we should be specific about the things that protect us, and technology is a big piece of that,” said Dimon.Dimon’s remarks come as a Nvidia’s H20 chips, designed specifically for the Chinese market, face mounting scrutiny from Beijing. Recently, Chinese regulators summoned Nvidia representatives over alleged security risks related to Nvidia H20 AI chips . However, later Nvidia publicly asserted that its chips contain ""no backdoors, no kill switches, and no spyware.""In a blog post shared, Nvidia’s chief security officer David Reber has vehemently denied the accusations of Chinese government alleging security risks in H20. “There is no such thing as a ‘good’ secret backdoor — only dangerous vulnerabilities that need to be eliminated,” wrote Reber in the blog post. He argued that it would ""undermine global digital infrastructure and fracture trust in US technology.Now the China is asking its tech companies to reconsider their orders for Nvidia’s H20 AI chips. According to a report by Financial Times, the development comes as various Chinese companies have been told to avoid using these AI chips, particularly for government-related projects.This move complicates the recent export arrangement Nvidia made with the Trump administration, which allowed the chips to be sold in China under the condition of a revenue-sharing agreement. According to White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, the Trump administration is still finalising the details of its agreement to collect a 15% export tax on revenue from Nvidia and AMD's chip sales to China.","Jpmorgan chase ceo jamie dimon has issued a blunt warning about america’s vulnerability in the global tech arms race.

"China push: In Nepal, EVs now account for 76% of all vehicles sold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/china-push-in-nepal-evs-now-account-for-76-of-all-vehicles-sold/articleshow/122960428.cms,"



KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Ev market share in nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including norway, singapore and ethiopia.

Four men in Northampton, England, raced away from an Indian restaurant without paying their 200-pound (about Rs 21,000) bill, which led to a spectacular chase by the staff. According to a Daily Mail article, the event took place in the Saffron restaurant at around 10.11 pm on August 4.Men can be seen entering the restaurant in the widely circulated CCTV footage posted on Instagram. Later in the video, they can be seen rushing out of the restaurant's door after leaving their table. When they reveal their intent, a staff member may be seen pursuing them. According to the complaint by the eatery, those men ordered and consumed 197.30 pounds of food, which included lamb chops, several curries, and other dishes.The company later posted the bill on Facebook. The bill breakdown included four plain poppadoms for £5.60, one chutney tray for £2.20, two chargrilled lamb chops for £24.00, three chicken chat dishes for £30.00, two chicken tikka mains for £28.00, two chicken tikka masalas for £32.00, two boiled rice portions for £11.00, two garlic naans for £12.00, three chapatis for £12.00, one serving of chips for £4.50, and nine 330 ml glass bottles of Coke for £36.00.Police in Northamptonshire acknowledged that they are looking into the event as a possible theft.""This kind of behavior isn't just theft; it affects hardworking small businesses and our local community,"" they wrote in a Facebook post.Online, the post generated a range of responses. ""Eat at home if you can't afford it! One user asked, ""Why are people these days so lazy to cook?""“This is why you swipe a card before they’re seated.

Turkey's hazelnut frost threatens chocolate supply chains,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/turkeys-hazelnut-frost-threatens-chocolate-supply-chains/articleshow/123355057.cms,".

Nutella's hazelnut headache

How bad is the Hazelnut shortfall?

Confectioners seek other supplies

Changing climate could normalize shortages





We've grown accustomed to supermarket shortages, from toilet paper during COVID-19 to sunflower oil amid the Ukraine war and eggs during bird flu outbreaks.The latest casualty is the hazelnut, due to a rare and devastating frost in April in Turkey, the world's largest supplier, and ongoing climate change pressures.Since April, hazelnut prices have jumped over 35%, as exporters rushed to buy up the more limited supply. At one point, Turkish hazelnut futures prices exceeded 200 lira ($4.91, €4.22) per kilogram, with predictions of $10 per kilo internationally.This shortfall is set to hit sweet tooths hard, as the cost of Nutella, the beloved chocolate-hazelnut spread, faces sharp price increases, along with other chocolates and baked goods.Although hazelnuts don't get much attention, they are a key ingredient in many premium and mass market products. The stakes are high for brands like Ferrero, which makes Nutella and reportedly uses around a quarter of the world's hazelnut supply.Nutella consists mainly of sugar and palm oil, but hazelnuts make up about 13% of the recipe. Millions of jars of the chocolate spread are sold annually, meaning even small price rises drive up production costs and squeeze margins.If sustained, the hazelnut shortage may force Ferrero and other producers to reformulate the recipes for their sweet treats. Confectioners could potentially be forced to shrink product sizes or pass costs onto consumers just as the popular festive period draws closer.Ferrero's roots are in Italy's Piedmont region, where high-quality Tonda Gentile hazelnuts are grown. In addition to Italy, Ferrero sources hazelnuts annually from Turkey, Chile and the United States.The Italian food giant also makes Ferrero Rocher, Kinder Bueno and Mon Cheri Hazelnut chocolates, among others, which all contain the nut.The company played down concerns about shortages in a statement to DW, saying: ""The Ferrero Group diversifies sourcing from multiple origins worldwide and, thanks to its long-term strategy, Ferrero does not expect any supply disruptions for its products.""The firm said its sourcing strategy ensured ""a consistent year-round supply.""Estimates from the Turkish Statistical Institute (TurkStat) in June put the 2025 crop at 520,000 metric tons, versus the roughly 750,000 tons expected initially, although it was later revised up.The International Nut & Dried Fruit Council (INC) told DW that the frost in Turkey had cut the hazelnut crop forecast by nearly 22% to about 601,000 tons in-shell, citing a more optimistic projection from the Black Sea Exporters' Association (KiB).According to INC, the latest estimate suggests the country lost about 167,000 tons to the frost, compared to initial fears of nearly 250,000.Fortunately, Turkey held back some of its 2022 crop — around 150,000 metric tons, INC said, which has now been exhausted. This should help reduce the shortfall.Hazelnuts are harvested annually, typically in late summer. However, in years of surplus, Turkey often stores excess crops for future sale as farmers anticipate higher prices.Corporate buyers are now looking to Chile, Georgia, and the US to reduce reliance on Turkey, but are also secretly hoping that prices stabilize if the 2025 Turkish crop is better than feared.""The hazelnut harvest in Turkey will begin on August 10 and is expected to be completed around mid-September,"" the German confectioners' association BDSI told DW in a written statement. BDSI said it would only be able to assess the impact once the harvest was over.Other hazelnut growing regions also face challenges. Chile and Georgia produce far less than Turkey, and US hazelnuts, mainly from Oregon, differ in flavor. Scaling up production elsewhere takes years, as hazelnut trees take 5-7 years to mature, limiting short-term relief.Some believe Turkey's delay in announcing a base hazelnut price last year also left a vacuum that was filled by speculators and exporters. The KiB traditionally sets a price floor at the beginning of the harvest to stabilize the market and guide farmer expectations.But the lack of a base price amplified shortage fears, drove up prices and triggered panic buying. Sensing an opportunity to profit, farmers withheld stock, further tightening supply.The shortage also exposes a more profound vulnerability: the fragility of crop-dependent sectors to the effects of climate change.Hazelnuts are particularly sensitive to spring frosts, and this year's cold snap in Turkey is a stark reminder of how the climate crisis doesn't just mean heat but unpredictability.Coffee and cocoa have recently faced climate-related disruptions. The hazelnut shortage has forced confectioners to rethink sourcing and ingredients for their sweet treats.Experts have warned that erratic weather could become more frequent, threatening hazelnuts, almonds and walnuts.","Since april, hazelnut prices have jumped over 35%, as exporters rushed to buy up the more limited supply.

‘Racist’: Swatch ad outrages China; watchmaker apologises over ‘slant-eye’ gesture,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/racist-swatch-ad-outrages-china-watchmaker-apologises-over-slant-eye-gesture/articleshow/123360241.cms,"Picture source: X





Swiss watchmaker Swatch has apologised and withdrawn an advertisement after it sparked anger in China for being racist.The ad showed an Asian male model pulling the corners of his eyes, a gesture widely criticised online as offensive. Chinese social media users accused the company of racism and called for a boycott of its products.On Saturday, Swatch said in posts on Instagram and Weibo that it had removed the campaign worldwide. “We sincerely apologise for any distress or misunderstanding this may have caused,” the company wrote.But many online said the apology was not enough. A popular Weibo user with more than one million followers accused Swatch of “racism against Chinese” and urged regulators to take action.Others claimed the ""slant-eye"" gesture"" was deliberate discrimination and demanded a boycott. ""The brand's image has collapsed. (Swatch) thinks they can just apologise and salvage everything? It's not that simple,"" one user wrote.China is among Swatch Group’s biggest markets, but like other Western luxury brands, the company has struggled with falling sales as the economy slows and buyers shift to cheaper options. In July, the group reported an 11.2 percent fall in net sales in the first half of the year, blaming weak demand in China.Swatch is not the first brand to face such criticism. Dolce & Gabbana faced backlash in 2018 for ads showing a Chinese model awkwardly using chopsticks, and Dior was accused of racism in 2023 over a photo of a model pulling her eye corner.","Chinese social media users accused swatch of racism and called for a boycott of its products.
