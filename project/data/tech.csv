"Shux, crew, study microalgae, cancer, cognition & more",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shux-crew-study-microalgae-cancer-cognition-more/articleshow/122168832.cms,"The view was still extraordinary, but the work, even more so for the Axiom-4 (Ax-4) crew. With Earth turning silently below them, the crew, including India’s Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla (Shux) spent their third day aboard the International Space Station (ISS) studying cancer, cognition, microalgae, the building blocks of long-term spaceflight, and more.The experiments being carried out by Shux and other crew members are part of the more than 60 scientific investigations from 31 countries, including India, the US, Poland, Hungary, Brazil, Nigeria, and Saudi Arabia. After all, Ax-4 is the most research-intensive private mission to the ISS to date.Shux, who had kicked off his research activity with a muscle loss study the previous day, was hard at work on a project that’s microscopic in size but potentially massive in impact. He deployed sample bags and imaging tools for a space microalgae experiment, studying how these tiny organisms fare in orbit.Rich in nutrients and capable of recycling carbon dioxide, microalgae could become a key part of long-duration space missions — a source of food, oxygen and life support rolled into one. He was also part of, along with other AX-4 crew, the “Neuro Motion VR” study, which uses virtual reality headsets and brain-monitoring technology (fNIRS) to observe how astronauts’ cognitive and motor functions respond to spaceflight.“Alongside that, they collected data for ‘Telemetric Health AI’, a project that merges biometric tracking with AI analytics to better understand how spaceflight affects the cardiovascular and balance systems. These studies aren’t just academic. They’re building the foundations for safe, extended human missions into deep space,” Axiom Space said.Commander Peggy Whitson, a seasoned astronaut on her fourth spaceflight, devoted much of the day to the Cancer in LEO (low-Earth orbit) investigation. Working with the Sanford Stem Cell Institute, she captured imaging samples of cancer cells exposed to microgravity. The stress of space may change the way these cells behave, potentially offering clues to tackling aggressive, metastatic cancers back on Earth.Her camera didn’t stop there. Whitson also photographed student-designed science experiments and artwork for the Saudi Space Agency’s Microgravity Challenge — a competition that drew over 80,000 entries from young innovators across the Arab world. With submissions ranging from sustainable farming ideas to space-inspired art, it’s an example of how missions like Ax-4 can inspire the next generation of scientists, engineers and dreamers.Mission specialist Suave (Slawosz Uznanski) focused his attention on the microfluidic design experiment to observe how fluids behave in low gravity. The end goal? Developing microfluidic devices that test drug stability and quality — a vital step toward bringing autonomous health care to future space travellers.And yet, research isn’t the only focus. The crew also reached out to Earth. Tibor Kapu shared a live conversation with Hungarian PM Viktor Orbán, while Whitson and Suave spoke with Axiom Space Chief Scientist Dr Lucie Low about protecting astronauts from space radiation — a challenge no future mission can ignore.","The axiom-4 (ax-4) crew spent their third day aboard the international space station (iss) studying cancer, cognition, microalgae, the building blocks of long-term spaceflight, and more.

Boston Bruins lock down Michael DiPietro with over $800k deal

Boston doubles down on stability with a flurry of strategic re-signings

Just when it looked like Boston might lose one of its most promising netminders to free agency, the Bruins made a decisive move—re-signing goaltender Michael DiPietro to a two-year contract worth $812,500 per season. Totaling $1.625 million, the deal ensures that the 25-year-old AHL standout remains in the fold, anchoring Boston’s goaltending pipeline and signaling a strong vote of confidence in his future.Michael DiPietro, once buried in Vancouver’s system during the chaotic pandemic-era seasons, saw his career revitalized after a 2022 trade to the Bruins. His breakout 2024–25 campaign with the Providence Bruins was nothing short of dominant: a .927 save percentage, 2.05 goals-against average, and a 26-8-7 record earned him AHL All-Star honors and the Aldege ""Baz"" Bastien Memorial Award as the league’s top goaltender.With Group VI UFA eligibility looming, DiPietro had become one of the hottest names among available goalies. As ESPN’s Kevin Weekes noted, he was “the top goalie available among Group 6 free agents.” The Bruins’ front office clearly agreed, choosing to act before the July 1 deadline.But DiPietro wasn’t the only one staying put. Boston also extended several core young players ahead of the 2025–26 season, showcasing a commitment to internal development over splashy free-agent signings.Among the biggest deals: forward Morgan Geekie inked a six-year, $33 million extension after a strong campaign with increased minutes and power-play impact. Defenseman Mason Lohrei, a rising blue-line presence, received a two-year, $6.4 million deal as the team preps him for top-four duties.The team also re-signed Johnny Beecher ($900K for one year), Henri Jokiharju (three years, $3 million AAV), and Marat Khusnutdinov (two years, $925K AAV), among others. These depth moves reflect a calculated strategy of cap control, chemistry, and trust in the Bruins' system.Also post: NHL Trade rumors: Bruins looking to reunite with Brad Marchand as Maple Leafs and Panthers intensify free agency pursuit Rather than chasing headlines with blockbuster names, Boston is investing in its own.

Not many people think twice about their passport—until they’re applying for one. Whether travelling abroad for a dream vacation, a foreign career, or an unexpected crisis, the process can be either smooth sailing or a nightmare. In the last decade, however, India's passport operations have undergone a quiet revolution in the background.On June 24, 2025, on the occasion of the observance of the 13th Passport Seva Divas, External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar recognised this change. His speech wasn't merely formal. It was a straightforward assessment of how technology, governance, and public service have converged to impact actual people daily.In a social media update on X, Dr. Jaishankar expressed gratitude to passport officials, both in India and posted overseas, for what he labelled as a ""remarkable transformation"" in service delivery. He associated the program with three pillars: Seva (service), Sushasan (good governance), and Garib Kalyan (welfare). For the minister, these concepts are no longer theoretical—they're being implemented through services such as the Passport Seva Programme.The passport application process in India was all about delays, red tape, and queuing up for years. The picture has changed dramatically now. The Passport Seva Programme (PSP), initiated by the Ministry of External Affairs, has gradually revolutionised the way individuals apply for, obtain, and renew their passports.Dr. Jaishankar said the PSP is an expression of the government's overall vision of a ""Viksit Bharat"", a developed India with technology and governance aligned to better serve citizens. To say it in his own words, ""Seva, Sushasan and Garib Kalyan are three major pillars of governance that would take us to a Viksit Bharat. They are all expressed with prominence in our Passport Seva Programme.""This scheme is not limited to cities alone. It has spread its wings to Tier 3 and Tier 2 towns and districts with Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSKs), so that first-time applicants, migrant labourers, and students in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities can avail of passport facilities without having to travel long distances.What was once seen as a long, often frustrating ordeal has now become a smoother and more accessible process. People are able to schedule appointments with ease, receive timely updates, and walk into clean, well-managed centres with helpful staff.Among the largest announcements this year is the country-wide introduction of e-Passports. They're not new passports with a new cover, they're embedded with a microchip bearing critical personal and biometric information.Here's what makes them different:The technology used is no different from that which is already common in most developed nations, bringing India's passport program to par with the best worldwide.e-Passports have several practical advantages:As per the latest updates from the Ministry of External Affairs, e-passports are issued phase-wise and in the next few years will become the norm for all new applicants.One of the more frustrating parts of applying for a passport has always been the police verification process. Depending on the location, this step could delay an application by weeks.In order to mitigate that, the Ministry of External Affairs launched the mPassport Police App, a mobile app now being used by the police in 25 states and Union Territories. As per the official update in the Ministry, the app has managed to decrease verification timelines to a mere 5 to 7 days in most regions.Police officers currently get electronic notifications, can upload proof of information at the scene, and transmit real-time updates to passport offices. This not only enhances speed but also avoids paperwork by hand and follow-up delays.For students, working professionals, and first-time applicants, this alone has made the whole process much more certain and less stressful.If you want to know how to obtain an e-passport, the procedure is not that different from obtaining a normal one. Here's how you do it:Following this, you will be able to follow up on your passport online until it arrives via post.","S.s. jaishankar launches passport seva 2.0 in india.

SoftBank is ‘all in’ on ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. CEO and Founder Masayoshi Son said the company is betting heavily on the artificial intelligence (AI) company, with planned investments worth 4.8 trillion Japanese yen (around $33.2 billion). Son said he believes OpenAI, currently unlisted and not profitable, will eventually become “the most valuable company in the world.” Speaking at a shareholder meeting, Son said SoftBank’s long-term goal is to play a leading role in the era of artificial superintelligence (ASI)—a concept he described as AI that is 10,000 times smarter than humans. The Japanese tech conglomerate has been expanding its partnership with OpenAI this year, including joining the $500 billion Stargate project.During the meeting, the Softbank CEO Masayoshi Son also revealed that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had once asked SoftBank for a $10 billion investment before Microsoft signed its now well-known partnership with the AI firm. “I said, yes, I would,” Son told shareholders. But Altman eventually went with Microsoft.The software giant recently lost its exclusive cloud provider status with OpenAI and hasn’t approved a reported restructuring plan to make OpenAI a traditional for-profit company.Despite the changing relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI, Masayoshi Son said SoftBank’s commitment remains firm. The company earlier stated it might reduce its stake if OpenAI doesn’t restructure by December 31, but Son clarified on Friday that their support will continue “regardless of what happens with Microsoft.”Son said OpenAI is key to SoftBank’s vision of building the world’s largest ASI platform. He reportedly aims for the company to become the “organizer of the industry in the artificial superintelligence era” within the next decade.SoftBank owns Arm, the UK-based chip company, and recently acquired U.S.-based chip designer Ampere for $6.5 billion.

Elon Musk’s SpaceX is under investigation by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) following a recent crane accident at the company’s Starbase, Texas, facility. The crane collapse was captured in a livestream by Lab Padre on YouTube, a channel focused on SpaceX. The video of the same was also shared on the social media platform X. Clips of the incident were widely shared across social media platforms.According to a report by CNBC, it was not immediately clear if any SpaceX workers sustained injuries as a result of the incident. Neither Musk nor other company executives have responded to requests for comment from the publication.Meanwhile, a spokesperson for OSHA informed CNBC that additional details will be made available once the investigation is complete. The incident reportedly occurred while the crane was involved in cleanup efforts following a recent Starship explosion at the site. Take a look at the video here:Previously, SpaceX has been said to have faced scrutiny over its workplace safety record, which has reportedly exceeded the industry average in terms of injuries. In one 2014 incident, employee Simon LeBlanc died due to a hazard the company failed to address, according to OSHA.These developments come as SpaceX continues to face operational challenges, including a recent crane collapse and several explosions involving its Starship Super Heavy launch vehicle—the rocket intended to support Musk’s long-term goal of Mars colonisation.Environmental groups in the US and Mexico have reportedly criticised the impacts of these incidents on local ecosystems, though SpaceX claims recent activities caused no harm.Starship is also tied to NASA’s Artemis mission to return humans to the moon. However, uncertainty around NASA’s upcoming budget—which is pending congressional approval—may affect upcoming collaborations with SpaceX.The Musk-led company has secured over $20 billion in federal contracts to date, mainly from NASA and the Department of Defence, the report adds.","Osha is investigating a crane accident at spacex's starbase, texas, facility.

Intel’s top strategy executive, Safroadu Yeboah-Amankwah , is reportedly departing the company. This marks the latest leadership change since Lip-Bu Tan assumed leadership of the US-based chipmaker in March. This exit follows Intel's recent announcement of layoff plans. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, Yeboah-Amankwah, who has served as Intel's chief strategy officer since 2020, will leave on June 30. The publication cited two individuals familiar with the matter who spoke anonymously to report this development. His responsibilities included overseeing growth initiatives, strategic partnerships, and equity investments for Intel.“We are grateful for Saf’s contributions to Intel and wish him the best,” the company said in a statement to Reuters.As per the Reuters report, some of Yeboah-Amankwah's strategic functions will now be handled by Sachin Katti, who was recently promoted to chief technology and AI officer at Intel. Moreover, Intel Capital, the company's venture arm, will now report directly to Lip-Bu Tan, two sources have confirmed to Reuters on the matter.Last week, Intel reportedly announced the dates for upcoming job cuts, confirming that layoffs would begin on July 15. According to a report by CRN, the company is starting the layoffs with 107 workers connected to its headquarters in Santa Clara, California.The move was part of a broader cost-cutting and restructuring initiative introduced by CEO Lip-Bu Tan in April this year to help improve the company’s performance.As per the report, Intel filed a notice under California’s Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification (WARN) Act. The company stated in the filing that affected employees would either receive a 60-day notice or a four-week notice accompanied by nine weeks of pay and benefits.In a statement to the publication, an Intel spokesperson said: “As we announced earlier this year, we are taking steps to become a leaner, faster and more efficient company.

LPG price cut: Commercial cylinders to get cheaper from July 1. But is the benefit coming to your home?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/lpg-price-cut-commercial-cylinders-to-get-cheaper-from-july-1-but-is-the-benefit-coming-to-your-home/articleshow/122172110.cms,"Representative image (Picture credit: PTI)

Oil marketing companies have reduced the price of 19 kg commercial LPG gas cylinders by Rs 58.50, offering some respite to commercial users from July 1.As per news agency ANI, the revised retail sale price in Delhi now stands at Rs 1,665 per cylinder.However, there has been no change in the prices of 14.2 kg domestic LPG cylinders.The fresh cut follows a series of adjustments over the past few months. In June, oil companies had slashed the price of the commercial cylinder by Rs 24, bringing it down to Rs 1,723.50. Before that, April had witnessed a Rs 41 reduction, while February saw a Rs 7 drop and March a minor Rs 6 hike.The reduction is expected to provide relief to small businesses like restaurants, hotels, and food vendors that depend heavily on commercial LPG for daily operations. However, for domestic users, there will be no relief in household kitchen budgets.While about 90 per cent of India’s total LPG consumption is household-based, the remaining 10 per cent caters to commercial, industrial, and automotive sectors. Notably, domestic LPG prices are often insulated from the frequent changes seen in commercial rates.According to ET, the average cost of India’s crude oil basket dropped to $64.5 per barrel in May 2025, its lowest in three years. This easing of crude prices is expected to help oil companies reduce their LPG-related losses by approximately 45 per cent in the upcoming financial year. India’s natural gas pricing is pegged to 10 per cent of this crude basket, which heavily influences domestic fuel dynamics.Over the last ten years, domestic LPG connections have more than doubled, reaching nearly 33 crore households by April 2025.","Oil marketing companies have reduced the price of 19 kg commercial lpg gas cylinders by rs 58.50.

Dubai just brought the future one step closer. In a dramatic and history-making moment in the middle of the desert, the city successfully completed the first test flight of a fully electric aerial taxi, a quiet, zero-emission aircraft that takes off and lands vertically, like something out of a sci-fi film.The sleek electric vertical take-off and landing (eVTOL) aircraft, developed by US-based Joby Aviation in collaboration with Dubai’s Roads and Transport Authority (RTA), is expected to revolutionize urban mobility. With a top speed of 320 km/h and a range of 160 km, the aerial taxi could make a trip from Dubai International Airport to Palm Jumeirah in just 12 minutes, a journey that currently takes about 45 minutes by car.“This test flight marks a turning point,” said Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, PTI quoted as saying. “It reflects our commitment to transforming breakthrough technologies into real-world solutions that enhance quality of life and redefine urban development.”The test was conducted at a dedicated desert site, showcasing the aircraft’s smooth take-off and landing abilities with minimal noise and a small physical footprint.The aircraft is designed to operate within cities and is poised to cut down on congestion and emissions, aligning with Dubai’s broader sustainability goals.Dubai aims to become the first city in the world to launch full-fledged aerial taxi services using a dedicated network of vertiports. Commercial operations are expected to begin in 2026, with stations located near Dubai International Airport among the first to go live.“This is not just a flight test,” said Mattar Al Tayer, Director General of RTA. “It’s the beginning of a new era of clean, fast, and smart mobility solutions.”JoeBen Bevirt, CEO of Joby Aviation, called the moment “a pivotal step” toward integrating aerial taxis into everyday life, starting in Dubai, and potentially taking off worldwide.Under the Dubai Economic Agenda D33, the project aligns with the emirate’s long-term goal to become a global hub for advanced transport technologies, and now, a city where flying to work may soon be as normal as calling a cab.","Dubai successfully completed the first test flight of a fully electric aerial taxi.

Rising Numbers and Strategic Talent hunt

40% were investors



60% came from other high-value categories



22% were professionals from banking and non-banking sectors, including those in AI and climate change roles

Expanding Eligibility, Rising Demand



Built-In Flexibility for Global Professionals







The UAE's widely-recognised Golden Visa programme, once a magnet primarily for foreign capital and real estate investment, is undergoing a fundamental transformation. Initially introduced in 2019 to attract long-term foreign residents through investment-led pathways, the programme is now zeroing in on specialised talent, especially in artificial intelligence, climate tech, and advanced digital sectors.This evolution reflects a larger strategic ambition: not just to host wealth, but to cultivate a workforce aligned with the country’s economic and innovation goals. The shift became especially pronounced post-2023, when the government moved beyond its pandemic-era push for capital influx and began empowering key federal entities, including the Ministry of Culture, Ministry of Sports, and the Abu Dhabi Residents Office, to identify and attract high-value individuals worldwide.Rather than focusing solely on monetary investments, authorities are now increasingly evaluating applicants based on their capacity to contribute to local ecosystems, whether through technical expertise, entrepreneurial leadership, or sector-specific knowledge.According to industry observers, among them Gaurav Keswani, founder and managing director of JSB, a Dubai-based advisory firm specialising in company formation and visa services, the UAE is now actively targeting professionals in emerging technology and sustainability sectors.Speaking to local news outlet Khaleej Times, Keswani noted that the Golden Visa programme has shifted focus from purely investment-led entry to attracting individuals who can contribute long-term value. Data from 2023 reveals that 158,000 Golden Visas were granted in Dubai alone, underscoring both the scale and strategic success of the initiative.Among these recipients:including a growing segment of individuals working in AI, IoT, cloud computing, and environmental solutions.This approach mirrors the UAE’s parallel push to become a hub for global finance and innovation. Over the past few years, eight of the world’s top 20 hedge funds have set up offices in the UAE, collectively managing an estimated $48 billion in business. But this influx of capital has created an equally urgent demand for executive talent, from CEOs and CTOs to AI consultants and infrastructure architects, capable of scaling these operations.“The government has realised that investment alone doesn’t build a sustainable economy,” Keswani explained. “There’s now a visible focus on people who can actively shape and grow industries, not just fund them.”Originally aimed at investors and property buyers, the Golden Visa’s scope now includes a broad array of profiles: scientists, outstanding students, coders, private wealth managers, and graduates of globally top-ranked universities. As new industries become national priorities, the visa programme is swiftly adapting to accommodate professionals who can advance them.Keswani’s firm, which has helped over 250 individuals secure Golden Visas in just the last six months, reports a surge in applicants from niche sectors such as AI ethics, green finance, and climate engineering. Many of these candidates are either driving large-scale innovation projects or are themselves investors bringing both capital and expertise into the region.“The last five months alone have seen a jump in shortlists for cloud specialists, private bankers, and AI developers,” Keswani noted. “These are people often behind billion-dollar strategies, not just jobseekers.”According to a local news agency report, the programme will likely continue diversifying, with more categories expected to be added, particularly around digital economy domains, including decentralised technologies and energy transition roles.What truly sets the UAE’s Golden Visa apart from similar long-term residency schemes is its structural flexibility. Professionals are not tied to a single employer and can freely transition into entrepreneurship or independent consultancy without losing their residency status. This flexibility, paired with residency terms of up to ten years, has made the programme especially attractive to senior global talent.Another key feature is the decoupling of investment from residency rights. For instance, a resident can liquidate their original investment and reallocate assets into different sectors without jeopardising their visa status. This legal separation allows for greater asset mobility, a major draw for high-net-worth individuals and top-tier executives.Targeting the Asia-Pacific talent pool has also become a strategic priority. As the UAE continues to position itself as a nexus between East and West, it is not just pulling in capital or companies, it’s bringing in the people behind them.","Dubai issued 158,000 golden visas in 2023, increasingly granted to professionals in ai, climate tech, and cloud computing.

Global Tensions Driving Up Oil Prices



How UAE Fuel Prices Are Set







Petrol and diesel prices across the UAE will increase starting July 1, 2025, following a period of global oil market uncertainty and geopolitical tensions. This comes after two months of relative stability, with June prices holding steady at May’s levels.The UAE’s Fuel Price Committee announced the revised retail rates for July late this month. The new prices, effective from Monday, July 1, are as follows:(up from Dh2.58 in June)(up from Dh2.47 in June)(up from Dh2.39 in June)(up from Dh2.45 in June)These increases mark a noticeable shift after fuel prices remained unchanged in June, following a slight rise in May and two months of consecutive declines prior to that.The July price hike was largely anticipated due to rising global crude prices earlier in June. Market analysts had projected an upward pressure on fuel prices after a series of geopolitical events triggered a surge in oil rates.According to reports, the spike followed a sharp escalation in the Middle East after conflict broke out between Israel and Iran, prompting U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites. These developments heightened fears of supply disruptions in the region, causing crude oil prices to rally.The UAE deregulated fuel prices in August 2015, linking them to global oil market trends. Since then, petrol and diesel rates are revised monthly by the UAE’s Fuel Price Committee, based on fluctuations in global crude prices.The revised prices are typically announced in the final days of each month and implemented from the 1st of the following month. This transparent pricing mechanism helps ensure that local retail rates reflect international energy market conditions, both up and down.","July fuel prices in the uae have increased after remaining steady in june and may, which followed two months of consistent declines.

Nearly 20% of cancer drugs defective in 4 African nations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/nearly-20-of-cancer-drugs-defective-in-4-african-nations/articleshow/122156329.cms,"Representative Image (AI-generated)

Causes need addressing, but it's not straightforward:

Not only cancer treatments are affected:

Prevention, detection and response:





An alarming number of people across Africa may be taking cancer drugs that don't contain the vital ingredients needed to contain or reduce their disease.It's a concerning finding with roots in a complex problem: how to regulate a range of therapeutics across the continent.A US and pan-African research group published the findings this week in The Lancet Global Health. The researchers had collected dosage information, sometimes covertly, from a dozen hospitals and 25 pharmacies across Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi and Cameroon.They tested nearly 200 unique products across several brands. Around 17% — roughly one in six — were found to have incorrect active ingredient levels, including products used in major hospitals.Patients who receive insufficient dosages of these ingredients could see their tumors keep growing, and possibly even spread.Similar numbers of substandard antibiotics, antimalarial and tuberculosis drugs have been reported in the past, but this is the first time that such a study has found high levels of falsified or defective anticancer drugs in circulation.""I was not surprised by these results,"" said Lutz Heide, a pharmacist at the University of Tübingen in Germany who has previously worked for the Somali Health Ministry and has spent the past decade researching substandard and falsified medicines.Heide was not part of the investigative group, but said the report shed light on a problem not previously measured.""I was delighted that, finally, someone published such a systemic report,"" he said. ""That is a first, really significant systematic study of this area.""""There are many possible causes for bad-quality products,"" Marya Lieberman of the University of Notre Dame in the US, the investigation's senior researcher, told DW.Those causes can include faults in the manufacturing process or product decay due to poor storage conditions. But some drugs are also counterfeit, and that increases the risk of discrepancies between what's on the product label and the actual medicine within.Spotting substandard and falsified products can be difficult. Usually, a medical professional or patient is only able to perform a visual inspection — literally checking a label for discrepancies or pills and syringes for color differences — to spot falsified products.But that's not a reliable method. In the study, barely a quarter of the substandard products were identified through visual inspection. Laboratory testing identified the rest.Fixing the problem, Lieberman said, will require improving regulation and providing screening technologies and training where they're needed.""If you can't test it, you can't regulate it,"" she said. ""The cancer medications are difficult to handle and analyze because they're very toxic, and so many labs don't want to do that. And that's a core problem for the sub-Saharan countries where we worked. Even though several of those countries have quite good labs, they don't have the facilities that are needed for safe handling of the chemo drugs established.""Nearly a decade ago, the World Health Organization found around one in 10 medicines used in low and middle-income countries were substandard or falsified. Independent research conducted since has backed those figures up, sometimes finding rates that are potentially twice as high.""This could lead to treatment failure, adverse reactions, disease progression,"" health economist Sachiko Ozawa told DW. Ozawa contributed to the investigation on anticancer drugs and has separately researched other cases of defective medicines.""For the community, there's also economic losses in terms of wasted resources,” she said. “So countries may be spending a lot of money on medications that are not going to be effective.""While high-income countries can monitor supply chains and have stringent regulatory systems in place to identify and withdraw suspect products, the infrastructure to do that is far from common in other regions.In those places, poor access to affordable medication often drives patients to less-regulated marketplaces. Inadequate governance and regulation, as well as a scarcity of surveillance and diagnostic equipment to test pharmaceuticals, are all contributing to the problem in Africa.""In high-income countries, I think there's a much more secure supply chain where you know the manufacturers are vetted, it has to go through very stringent regulatory processes to get approval...it gets tested more frequently,"" said Ozawa.The WHO told DW that following the report's findings, it was working with the four affected countries to address the problem.""We are concerned with the findings the article has highlighted. WHO is in contact with national authorities of four impacted countries and obtaining relevant data,"" it said in a statement. ""We expect to assess full information to evaluate the situation, which often takes time and capacity. But we're committed to address these issues working with the relevant countries and partners.""The WHO also reiterated its ongoing call for countries to improve their regulatory frameworks to ""prevent incidents of substandard and falsified medicines, including in settings of cancer programs.""In 2017, the WHO's review of substandard and falsified medicines offered three solutions based around prevention, detection and response.S topping the manufacture and sale of those medicines is the primary preventative measure, but where defective products make it to market, surveillance and response programs can prevent poor quality medicines from reaching patients.But regulatory reform sought by experts and authorities takes time. More immediate solutions are being developed in the form of better screening technologies.Lieberman is working on a ""paper lab"" — a type of test that can be used by trained professionals to chemically test the quality of a product before it's administered to a patient. Other laboratory technologies are also under development.One comforting point is that while a significant proportion of the medication circulating in medical facilities in the four African countries was defective, the majority of the products tested met required standards.""[With] two-thirds of the suppliers, all the products [were] good quality, so there are good quality suppliers,"" said Heide. ""But a few of them really have a suspiciously high number of failing samples.""","A us and pan-african research group published the findings this week in the lancet global health. The researchers had collected dosage information, sometimes covertly, from a dozen hospitals and 25 pharmacies across ethiopia, kenya, malawi and cameroon. Around 17% — roughly one in six — were found to have incorrect active ingredient levels.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122156341,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1123440,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
