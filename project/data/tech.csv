Chinese firms are slashing AI costs

Google has started introducing new artificial intelligence features to its Gemini Live platform, enabling real-time interpretation of smartphone screens and camera feeds.

These allow users to ask questions about what’s currently visible on their screen or through the camera lens, receiving context-aware responses. The features are being made available exclusively to Gemini Advanced users subscribed to the Google One AI Premium plan, with a gradual rollout expected over the month.

When should you exit an investment? Top things to keep in mind,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/investing/when-should-you-exit-an-investment-top-things-to-keep-in-mind/articleshow/119410980.cms,"Here are key scenarios where exiting an investment may be advisable. (AI image)

By Sandeep Walunj

""If the job has been correctly done when a common stock is purchased, the time to sell it is – almost never."" – Philip Fisher

""You may not know when to start but must know when to stop!""

Here are key scenarios where exiting an investment may be advisable:

1. Achievement of Goals

Did you invest with a clear goal—retirement, buying a house, or funding education? If so, exit when the goal nears.

Shift to less volatile asset classes as the exit date approaches to minimize risks.

2. Profit Booking

Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio – If significantly above historical or sector averages, it may indicate overvaluation. Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio – A high ratio may signal overvaluation relative to intrinsic worth. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis – If the stock price has reached its fair value based on future cash flows, exiting may be prudent.

Reinvest proceeds wisely and consider tax implications.

During a market rally, sell in tranches to secure gains while retaining exposure.

3.

Stop-Loss Strategy

A stop-loss order sets a predetermined exit point to limit losses.

Example: If a stock is bought at ₹100 with a 10% stop-loss, sell it at ₹90, preventing larger losses.

Set stop-loss levels based on investment type—example 5-15% for volatile stocks, 15-25% for stable blue-chip stocks—aligned with your risk tolerance.

4. Underperformance

Mutual Funds – If it lags behind category peers and benchmarks persistently.

Stocks – Red flags include:

Declining revenues and profits. Rising debt levels. Loss of market leadership. Governance issues (e.g., fraud, regulatory troubles).



5. Portfolio Rebalancing

A well-diversified portfolio needs periodic rebalancing.

If an asset class grows disproportionately large, reduce exposure and reinvest in underweighted assets.

Example: If equities surge, selling some stocks and reallocating to bonds can maintain balance.

6. Market and Economic Conditions

Rising Interest Rates – Sectors like real estate and capital-intensive industries may underperform in this scenario.

Recession Indicators – An inverted yield curve or declining consumer spending may warrant exiting cyclical stocks.

Regulatory Changes – New laws, tax policies, or sectoral regulations can impact profitability.

Behavioural Biases That Delay Exit Decisions

Loss Aversion – Refusing to sell at a loss, hoping for recovery instead of reallocating capital.

Confirmation Bias – Ignoring negative signals and focusing only on positive news.

Anchoring Bias – Fixating on past high prices and resisting selling below that level.

Investors often see every investment brand, platform, influencer, and even advisors pushing them to invest and invest quickly. However, there is little discussion on when to exit.Most experts seem to suggest that selling is unnecessary:On the other hand, practical voices like Zig Ziglar say:So, where does the truth lie? As always, somewhere in the middle!If the objective was profit booking, evaluate if further upside exists using frameworks like:Exit an investment if it consistently underperforms, despite a reasonable recovery period:Macroeconomic shifts can impact investment viability.

Here’s how you can still get gratuity",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/savings/gratuity-eligibility-payout-and-formula-leaving-job-before-5-years-heres-how-you-can-still-get-gratuity/articleshow/119248440.cms,"Gratuity payment calculations are governed by specific guidelines outlined in the Payment of Gratuity Act. (AI image)

How is gratuity payment calculated? Formula explained

The calculation method is: (15X Final drawn salary X Service duration)/26

The computation would be: (15X40,000X5)/26.

The gratuity amount due to Mis X is Rs 1,15,384.61, rounded to Rs 1,15,385.

For staff not under the Payment of Gratuity Act's purview:

The computation for his gratuity proceeds as: (15X40,000X6)/30.

The final gratuity amount that Mr X shall receive is Rs 1,20,000.

Salaried employees quite often have gratuity as a component of their CTC (cost to company). The Payment of Gratuity Rules, 1972, stipulates that staff members become entitled to gratuity after completing five years of uninterrupted service with an organisation. But, did you know that you can qualify for gratuity payout before completing five years, provided they serve beyond a particular duration.According to an ET report, experts say that employees qualify for gratuity upon completing 4 years and 240 days with an organisation. For example, if someone began working at an organisation on January 1, 2021, they would be eligible for gratuity upon leaving after August 29, 2025. This eligibility occurs because they would have served 4 years and 240 days by then, although their five-year milestone would only be completed by January 1, 2026.This provision exists because of how continuous service is defined in the Payment of Gratuity Act Puneet Gupta, Tax Partner, EY India, told ET, ""Section 4(1) of the Payment of Gratuity Act says that gratuity will be payable if an employee has rendered a minimum continuous service of five years. Section 2A of the Payment of Gratuity Act defines continuous service. Section 2A(2) of the Gratuity Act defines the deemed-to-be in continuous service. An employee is deemed to be in continuous service for one year if an employee during the 12 preceding calendar months has worked under the employer for not less than 190 days or 240 days, as the case may be.""Also Read | Tax planning before March 31 deadline? Tax saving fixed deposits with high interest rates - check list According to the Payment of Gratuity Act, employees working in underground mines or establishments operating fewer than six days weekly must complete 190 days, whilst others need 240 days. When an employee completes more than 240 days in the fifth year, they are considered to have completed an additional year of service, totalling five years, thus becoming eligible for gratuity.Saraswathi Kasturirangan, Partner at Deloitte India explains that an employee on payroll becomes eligible for gratuity payment upon completing 4 years and 240 days of service when leaving the organisation. The 240-day period is equivalent to 7.89 months. Therefore, workers should ensure their tenure extends to 4 years and 8 months to qualify for gratuity benefits upon resignation or retirement, she says. Consequently, staff members whose continuous service falls short of 4 years and 240 days, for instance, those departing after 4 years and 6 months or 4 years, 6 months and 1 day, cannot claim gratuity benefits, she notes.The requirement of five years' continuous service is waived if the employee's service ends due to death or disablement.Gratuity payment calculations are governed by specific guidelines outlined in the Payment of Gratuity Act. The calculation method varies depending on whether employees fall under the Act's purview or not.Also Read | Gold prices at record high! Have yellow metal prices peaked? Check these 5 charts before putting more money in gold The Act's applicability is determined by the organisation's workforce size. If an organisation has employed 10 or more people on any single day within the previous 12 calendar months, it comes under the Act's jurisdiction. Once covered, the organisation remains subject to the Act even if staff numbers subsequently decrease below 10.For staff members covered by the Payment of Gratuity Act, the payment is calculated using 15 days of their final drawn salary for each full year of service, including any period exceeding six months.The final drawn salary encompasses basic pay, dearness allowance and sales commission, as stipulated in the Act.Consider Miss X who has served an organisation (with a six-day work week) for 4 years and 300 days. Her eligibility for gratuity payment is confirmed as her service exceeds 4 years and 240 days. With a final basic salary of Rs 40,000, the 300 days convert to 9.863 months. For gratuity calculations, when excess months exceed 6 (9 months here), it counts as one complete year.Also Read | New TDS rules from April 1, 2025: Check new tax deduction limits for FD interest, MFs and lottery wins Gratuity remains payable even when organisations aren't covered by the Payment of Gratuity Act. In such instances, the gratuity is calculated as half a month's salary per completed service year, disregarding any incomplete year (months less than a year) in the calculation.The gratuity calculation follows this equation: (15 X Last drawn salary X Number of years of completed service)/30.Consider a scenario where Mr X has served an organisation (not under the Act's purview) for 6 years and 7 months. His final basic salary stands at Rs 40,000, and the organisation opts to provide him with gratuity.",Gratuity payment calculations are governed by specific guidelines outlined in the payment of gratuity act.

Tesla sales in the European Union dropped sharply in the first two months of the year, as Elon Musk's politics and outdated models may be driving consumers away.According to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association (ACEA), Tesla's new registrations declined by 49 percent to 19,046 units in the first two months compared to the previous year's same period.This decline occurred despite the EU's overall electric vehicle sales increasing by 28.4 percent to 255,489 units during the same period, achieving a 15.2 percent market share.Tesla faces increased competition from newer Chinese and European electric vehicles, whilst operating with older models.The company's European reputation has suffered due to Musk's support for a German far-right party and his involvement with President Donald Trump's administration, which has had strained relations with the EU.Recent weeks have seen vandalism at various Tesla dealerships across the United States, alongside a substantial decrease in the company's stock value over the past month.In Germany, Europe's largest automotive market, there have been multiple incidents targeting Tesla vehicles, with eight cars being set on fire since 2024 began.These events followed Musk's controversial public support for the Alternative for Germany (AfD) party during the recent general election. German Tesla sales decreased by 76 percent in February, following January's 60 percent decline, according to official statistics.While German electric vehicle sales generally decreased after government subsidy cancellation, Tesla's decline contrasts with the sector's overall recovery.Despite upgrades to the popular Model 3 and Model Y, the vehicles maintain their original appearance. European consumers may have been deterred by reliability issues and the Cybertruck recall, despite the vehicle not being available in Europe.ACEA data shows Tesla's market share at 1.1 percent for January and February 2025, with February registrations dropping 47 percent to 11,743 units.Despite a slight market share improvement to 1.4 percent in the following month, Tesla remained behind Chinese manufacturer SAIC's MG brand of electric and hybrid vehicles.The electric car market expanded in Germany, Belgium, and the Netherlands, while gaining momentum in Spain and Italy, the ACEA added.","Tesla sales in the eu dropped by 49 percent in the first two months of the year.

The 150th anniversary of the Metre Convention in 2025 celebrates international collaboration in metrology . The Bureau International des Poids et Mesures (BIPM) has adoptedas the theme, highlighting metrology's role in driving progress and innovation.Over the past century and a half, metrology has evolved, incorporating changes to make it more stable and reliable. A notable example is the 2019 revision of the SI (Systeme Internationale) Units , redefining the kilogram, Ampere, Kelvin, and mole. The field of metrology is almost ancient, though, and not just a twenty first century phenomenon. In ancient Egypt, the standard unit of measurement of length was a cubit, which was equal to the length of the Pharaoh’s forearm, added to the width of his palm. Metrology has traversed a long and interesting journey starting from the age of first principles, then the golden period of the mechanical marvels, leading to the advent of electronics, and later digital, and now we are poised to experience contactless metrology.Let us take the example of the automotive industry, and the regular car you drive. The dimensional accuracy of brake discs is critical to prevent brake failures. Industrial metrology techniques, such as surface measurement and contour measurement, are used to measure the dimensions and surface finish of brake discs, ensuring the safety of drivers and passengers on the road. This is just one example of how industrial metrology impacts our everyday lives.This is but one example of how metrology is not an arcane subject for laboratories but affects us every day. Simply put, metrology is the scientific study of measurement. More pertinently, it is the application of such study to improve our lives.Metrology is not just for academics; it's closely tied to everyday life. Recent advancements include data-driven metrology for real-time analysis and quality predictions, non-contact measurement techniques like confocal microscopy and optical interferometry enable high-speed, high-precision inspections.As metrology integrates with Industry 4.0, smart measuring instruments and IoT devices enable continuous monitoring and adaptive adjustments, ensuring robust quality control with minimal human intervention. Fully automated metrology systems will drive efficiency and cost savings in the future.Leading this push towards the future in India is Mahr Metrology India Pvt Ltd , a 100% owned subsidiary of Mahr GmBH. They offer a wide range of dimensional metrology solutions, including simple callipers, form and surface measuring machines, and non contact measuring systems, to name just a few making them a significant player in the Indian Metrology Industry.Starting as a small family business in the Swabian town of Esslingen, Mahr GmBH has exemplified innovative metrology, and set quality and assurance benchmarks for over 160 years. Not many people know that Carl Mahr, founder of Carl Mahr Holding GmbH in 1862, made one of the very first calipers in 1868. Back then, it was called a caliber.But let’s get back to the future. The future of dimensional metrology is expected to be driven by advancements in automation, data analytics and precision engineering. As industries demand increasingly accurate measurements, Mahr is evolving and pivoting to integrate SMARTt technologies that enhance speed, accuracy, and efficiency.From traditional precision engineering sectors like ICE (Internal Combustion Engines) and power transmission to new-age domains like semiconductors, electronics, mobile telephony, medical implants, Optics, and even aerospace and defence, Mahr offers state-of-the-art cutting-edge solutions like MahrSurf 3D, OptoSurf and Mahr Engineered Solutions. For India to become a global manufacturing powerhouse, investments in quality assurance is key. This is where Mahr comes in to support the biggest Indian companies in their quality excellence journey.Since 2021, Mahr in India has been revamping their applications engineering team and augmenting the distribution network to be more accessible to customers. They have created a chain of SMART application centres across the country, and each such centre has a fully equipped experience centre attached to provide customers a hands-on experience. Mahr follows the credo of the 5Cs: Co-create Solutions, Customer Engagement, Customer Closeness, Competent Sales Team and Committed Channel Partners.Internally, these efforts have reaped results in the form of a 2.3 times growth in business since FY 20-21. Externally, the industry is looking at Mahr with renewed respect, and validation has come in the form of peer recognition. The most recent feather in their cap was the award for Best Business Agility they won at the International Business and Education Awards 2024.The future seems to be very exciting for metrology in India, and Mahr is positioned to derive maximum value.You can learn about the products and services of Mahr at their website , or get updates about their latest progress on LinkedIn","The 150th anniversary of the metre convention in 2025 celebrates international collaboration in metrology.
