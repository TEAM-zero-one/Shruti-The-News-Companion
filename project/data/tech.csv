Maintaining sustained eco growth govt’s top priority: FM Nirmala Sitharaman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/maintaining-sustained-eco-growth-govts-top-priority-fm-nirmala-sitharaman/articleshow/122929506.cms,"NEW DELHI: Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman on Saturday said that sustaining economic growth remains the top priority for the government, along with providing the necessary support to the economy.At a book launch event, the minister said multilateral bodies were facing challenges and India needed to not just be part of the discussions to rework the international architecture for the next century but also be the voice of the Global South.She said the government had prioritised public investment over the last few years with Prime Minister Narendra Modi himself pushing her ministry to step up capex every year. ""I believe, based on data before me, that it (investment) is one of the primary drivers of sustained economic growth. It can be higher but the level at which we have maintained investment is largely on the back of public capital expenditure. We can make sure policy on FDI is friendly and attractive enough to get more investment into India. Third, I can see states also competing to attract investments and each is doing very best,"" Sitharaman said.The minister, however, indicated that companies may be sitting on large investible funds.""Is Indian private sector growing in pace with the government investment? Since 2019 once the twin balance sheet problem was addressed and corporate tax was brought down, we can see that the balance sheets of the private sector are healthier. But today, are they sitting on passive investible funds. That's an issue on which I would want industry to speak,"" she said.Asked about calls for easing restrictions on Chinese investments and business, Sitharaman sounded a note of caution. ""Post-Covid and post-Galwan, for all (land) bordering countries, we had come up with 'Press Note 3' because we didn't want big business happening with them. In some renewable energy areas, where the entire project was done by, say China, and there were difficulties in getting technical experts to travel to India, that to some extent was relaxed. During the US-China tariff war there was a lull,"" she said.",Finance minister nirmala sitharaman says sustaining economic growth remains the top priority for the government.

Pete Dejoy, the interim CEO of Astronomer, did not bury his head on the scandal as he took charge of his new role and instead put out a statement on LinkedIn. Dejoy said the media attention to their startup because of the viral video has been unusual and surreal. Astronomer is now a household name, he said adding that he would never wish for it to happen like this.""At Astronomer we have never shied away from challenges; a near-decade of building this business has tested us time and time again, and each time we’ve emerged stronger.

US Adds $250 Visa Integrity Fee: What It Means For Indian Travelers & Tech Workers | Explained

'JD Vance is misleading people'







Vice president JD Vance slammed US companies prioritizing H-1Bs instead of giving jobs to Americans and said he does not believe in the bulls**t story that these companies can't find workers in America. Speaking at a bipartisan event co-hosted by the Hill and Valley Forum, Vance questioned the ethics and economic logic behind mass layoffs by companies like Microsoft which is followed by an increase in H-1B applications.This suggests that these companies are laying off Americans and then applying to hire people from overseas.""You see some big tech companies where they'll lay off 9,000 workers, and then they'll apply for a bunch of overseas visas. And I sort of wonder; that doesn't totally make sense to me,"" Vance said.""That displacement and that math worries me a bit. And what the president has said, he said very clearly: We want the very best and the brightest to make America their home. We want them to build great companies and so forth. But I don't want companies to fire 9,000 American workers and then to go and say, 'We can't find workers here in America.' That's a bulls**t story.""Microsoft recently laid off 9,000 employees globally and came under scrutiny for its use of the H-1B visa program. According to several social media claims. Microsoft submitted applications for more than 6,000 H-1B visas since October while they are also laying off so many employees.An Indian-American tech investor reacted to JD Vance's suggestion and said the vice president would not mention that many of the 9,000 laid off employees were H-1Bs too and they got no severance, no safety net and just a 60-day countdown to leave the country.""Microsoft didn’t bring in new foreign workers after laying people off , they renewed visas for long-time employees who’ve been in the U.S. legally for many many years, stuck in green card backlogs. Saying that’s “replacing Americans” is like saying letting a loyal employee stay and renew his visa in the building is the same as hiring someone new off the street. It’s not. It’s just letting them stay in the job they already earned,"" the tech investor wrote.","Jd vance issued a stern h-1b warning and slammed companies like microsoft for laying off people while continuing overseas hiring.

Life after IAS: Microsoft and AI

A lifelong passion for music

Kashish Mittal is what every Indian parent dreams of and what every nosy relative secretly resents. An IIT topper (AIR 6), IAS officer at 21, Microsoft techie, AI entrepreneur , and now an Indian classical singer — his career timeline reads like a Bollywood script co-written by UPSC aspirants, tech bros, and art lovers. For the middle class, he was the ultimate “shaadi biodata material” until he did the unthinkable: quit the IAS and followed his heart into music. For relatives, his CV is a nightmare, as they hide their jealousy behind forced smiles, and for many others, it’s simply unbelievable. His bold decisions have left family WhatsApp groups stunned and LinkedIn timelines inspired. Today, his soulful lyrics and viral posts are making him India’s most melodious multi-hyphenate.Mittal’s academic excellence was evident early on. After securing an AIR 6 in the JEE, he pursued electrical engineering at IIT Delhi. In 2009, he cracked the UPSC exam and joined the IAS, becoming one of the youngest officers in his batch. He held significant positions, including serving as the private secretary to the Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog. However, in 2019, Mittal made headlines by resigning from the IAS, reportedly dissatisfied with a transfer to Arunachal Pradesh. His departure from civil service sparked debates and admiration alike.Contrary to popular perception that he gave up all structured work, Mittal joined Microsoft after leaving the IAS, working in AI-driven projects. His tech journey didn’t stop there. In 2025, he co-founded an AI startup focused on human potential and ethical technology. His transition from bureaucracy to big tech and now entrepreneurship reflects his diverse interests and adaptability.Mittal had been training in Hindustani classical music since childhood. Post-IAS, he gave his full attention to music, performing professionally as a classical vocalist of the Agra Gharana. He is an empanelled artist with ICCR and All India Radio, with his compositions reflecting a blend of spiritual depth and technical rigor. His renditions have gained widespread attention online, with many calling him a rare blend of intellect and art.In addition to his performances, Mittal’s presence on social media has contributed significantly to his viral fame in 2024 and 2025. His LinkedIn posts offer a unique blend of personal reflections, career insights, and poetic musings, resonating particularly well with a generation that values authenticity and non-traditional success stories. Screenshots of his profile and posts circulate widely, sparking conversations about breaking free from societal expectations and pursuing passion alongside professional achievement.Moreover, Mittal’s Instagram reels have garnered massive engagement. A particularly viral reel features him singing Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan’s “Unke Andaz-e-Karam,” amassing nearly 3 million views. The video captures his soulful voice and classical training in a spontaneous, relatable setting, often shared with captions reflecting the emotions of love and loss. This blend of classical artistry and modern social media appeal has cemented his status as a multi-hyphenate artist capturing the imagination of India’s youth and beyond. His journey is a reminder that it's never too late to rewrite your story and sing your own tune.","Kashish mittal was an iit topper (air 6), ias officer at 21, microsoft techie, ai entrepreneur, and now an indian classical singer.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has shared a post on X (formerly Twitter), suggesting a shift in his stance toward artificial intelligence . Admitting he had been “living in denial” about the technology for too long, Elon Musk wrote in the post: “I resisted AI for too long. Living in denial. Now it is game on.” Musk was replying to a post shared by an X user Mario Nawfal that quoted Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang who called Musk a ‘superhuman’.While Elon Musk has been both a vocal critic and early investor in AI, he has previously warned about the dangers of uncontrolled AI development, once calling it humanity’s “biggest existential threat.” His latest statement suggests a more aggressive pivot from caution to action.The post comes as the tech billionaire continues to expand his presence in the AI space through xAI , the startup he launched in 2023 to compete with companies like OpenAI , Google DeepMind, and Anthropic.Elon Musk’s relationship with AI has been complex. The tech CEO co-founded ChatGPT-maker OpenAI in 2015, but later distanced himself from the company. Over the years, he has expressed concerns about AI safety, calling for regulation and greater oversight.While Elon Musk did not elaborate on what specific moves might follow his tweet, observers say the post is likely a signal to investors, rivals, and users that he intends to take a more direct role in AI development. Notably, the tech CEO tagged three of his major companies – Tesla, SpaceX and xAI in his post.Elon Musk’s “game on” remark also hints at increasing competition in the AI sector, where companies are racing to release faster, more powerful language models and build new infrastructure to support them.In a related news, Tesla India recently shared a post on X, announcing an update on the availability of Tesla cars in the country. “Now everyone in India can order directly on our website,” the post read, adding that four cities will get priority delivery.

The rise of physical AI and the future of robotics

During a recent visit to Beijing, Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang was asked what he would study if he were a 20-year-old graduate in 2025. His answer was clear: he’d choose a different academic direction than the one that launched his own career. Though he didn’t explicitly name a single subject, Huang emphasized that he would lean more toward the physical sciences rather than software. This subtle but significant shift points to his evolving view of where the next wave of opportunity lies. His response reflects a broader vision for the future of artificial intelligence—one rooted not just in code, but in physics, robotics , and the mechanics of the real world that AI must increasingly learn to navigate and reason through.Jensen Huang, who earned his electrical engineering degree from Oregon State University and a master’s from Stanford, co-founded Nvidia in 1993. Today, the company sits at the forefront of the AI revolution and recently hit a historic $4 trillion market cap. While reflecting on his own path, Huang revealed he had graduated from college at age 20 and, if given the chance again, would pursue physical sciences, fields that deal with non-living systems like physics, chemistry, and astronomy.Although he didn’t go into specifics about why, Huang’s broader remarks provide insight. Over the years, AI has evolved from “Perception AI,” which focused on recognition tasks like image detection, to “Generative AI,” which includes language models capable of translating, coding, and creating. But the next chapter, according to Huang, is “Reasoning AI,” systems that can understand context, solve novel problems, and act as “agentic AI” or digital robots with reasoning power.Huang’s vision aligns with growing industry momentum around embodied AI—where intelligence is tied to physical systems like robots or autonomous machines. Leading research labs such as DeepMind and Boston Dynamics are already exploring this frontier, integrating reinforcement learning with robotics to train systems capable of real-world interaction and problem-solving. This convergence of AI with physics and motion is what Huang sees as the next great leap.Huang’s remarks hint at a future where AI is not just software-driven but deeply embedded in the physical world. This shift could redefine education paths for aspiring technologists, with physics and engineering regaining center stage. It’s no longer just about writing better code; it’s about building machines that think, move, and adapt. And for Huang, the future of AI might look less like a screen and more like a robot with a brain.Looking ahead, Huang predicts the rise of “Physical AI,” where artificial intelligence must grasp real-world physics: friction, inertia, cause and effect. These capabilities go beyond generating text or images—they involve anticipating how objects move, how to grip items with the right force, or how to infer the presence of hidden obstacles like a pedestrian behind a car.When AI gains this kind of physical reasoning and is embedded into machines, it leads to robotics, a critical component of Huang’s vision. With global labor shortages and the rapid expansion of manufacturing facilities, especially across the United States, Huang sees robotics powered by physical AI as essential. “Hopefully, in the next 10 years... they’re highly robotic and helping us deal with the severe labor shortage,” he said, underscoring the need for innovation that bridges the digital and physical worlds.","Jensen huang predicts the rise of “physical ai,” where artificial intelligence must grasp real-world physics.

AI-powered growth and record investments

From modest beginnings to Silicon Valley’s summit

After a decade at the helm of Alphabet, Sundar Pichai has officially joined the ranks of billionaires, marking a rare achievement for a non-founding tech CEO. Pichai, who took over as CEO of Google in 2015 and became Alphabet’s chief in 2019, now holds a net worth of $1.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The milestone comes after Alphabet’s market value soared by over $1 trillion since early 2023, delivering 120% returns to investors. Pichai’s rise has been defined by his leadership through multiple technological shifts, from mobile and cloud computing to AI. As Alphabet’s shares hit record highs, his decade-long stewardship has culminated in both financial success and strategic transformation.While tech billionaires are often company founders, Pichai’s entry into the billionaire club is different. He holds just 0.02% of Alphabet’s economic stake, currently valued at around $440 million. Most of his net worth comes from share sales and performance-based compensation over the past ten years. Bloomberg reports that he has sold over $650 million in stock during his tenure. If he had retained all his shares, they would now be worth more than $2.5 billion. Despite the modest stake, Pichai’s long-term vision and steady leadership have driven massive growth in Alphabet’s core businesses.August 2025 marks ten years since Pichai became CEO of Google. In that time, Alphabet has expanded rapidly, turning once-nascent divisions like YouTube, Cloud, Play, and Subscriptions into billion-dollar engines. In a recent post on X, Pichai highlighted that in 2015, Alphabet’s total revenue was $75 billion, whereas YouTube and Google Cloud alone are now generating an annual run rate of $110 billion. Under his leadership, Alphabet restructured into a parent holding company, sharpened its AI focus, and increased its global footprint.A major factor in Alphabet’s recent trillion-dollar surge has been its aggressive AI investments . The company spent $50 billion in 2023 alone on infrastructure, semiconductors, and data centers to support its AI ambitions. It also raised its 2025 capital expenditure forecast by $10 billion, reaching $85 billion, most of which is earmarked for AI infrastructure. “Our AI infrastructure investments are crucial to meeting the growth in demand for cloud customers,” Pichai said during the Q2 earnings call. Alphabet’s DeepMind acquisition in 2014 for $400 million has also paid off, helping the company stay ahead in the AI race. Pichai's rise reflects a new era where operational excellence, not just founding status, can build tech empires.Born in Tamil Nadu, India, Sundar Pichai’s journey to Silicon Valley is one of resilience and brilliance. He grew up in a two-room apartment, with his first telephone arriving when he was 12. A scholarship brought him to Stanford in 1993, with a one-way plane ticket that reportedly cost more than his father’s annual salary. Pichai joined Google in 2004, led the development of Chrome, and later oversaw Android, before rising to the top job.Sundar Pichai is also known for his calm, consensus-driven leadership style, which has earned him respect in an industry often defined by bold personalities. In recent years, he has become increasingly vocal on topics like AI regulation, digital privacy, and ethical tech, positioning Alphabet as a global thought leader beyond just innovation.Outside of tech, Pichai has also ventured into sports.

Asset managers navigate data security challenges

BlackRock , the world's largest asset manager, has imposed new restrictions on company-issued devices for employees traveling to China, requiring staff to use temporary loaner phones and prohibiting company laptops during business trips, according to Bloomberg News and Reuters reports.The financial giant detailed the ""policy enhancement"" in an internal memo effective July 16, barring the use of BlackRock-issued iPhones, iPads, laptops, and remote access via virtual private networks while in China. Employees will also lose access to the BlackRock network during personal travel to the country, Bloomberg reported.The move reflects mounting corporate anxiety about business operations in China as geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing continue to strain international business relationships. BlackRock did not immediately respond to requests for comment from either Reuters or Bloomberg.The restrictions come after a series of high-profile incidents involving Western business executives being prevented from leaving China. Wells Fargo suspended travel to China last week after one of its senior trade financing bankers, Chenyue Mao, was blocked from departing the country in what Beijing's foreign ministry described as a criminal matter.Earlier this month, China also prevented a US Patent and Trademark Office employee from leaving during a personal visit, while a US Commerce Department worker has reportedly been unable to leave China for several months.Since China implemented stricter data security laws in 2021, global financial firms have struggled to balance operational needs with compliance requirements. Many banks and asset managers have established onshore data centers to keep Chinese information within the country, adding significant costs and complicating business management.BlackRock maintains a substantial presence in China through a wholly owned mutual fund company and a wealth management joint venture with China Construction Bank Corp. The firm's new travel policy reflects the broader challenges facing global financial institutions operating in an increasingly complex regulatory and security environment between the world's two largest economies.Meanwhile, Amazon is shutting down its AI lab in Shanghai amid rising geopolitical tensions between the US and China. Launched in 2018, this lab contributed to over 100 academic papers and helped develop a neural network framework that generated close to $1 billion in sales, according to a scientist at the lab.As reported by The Financial Times, the development was confirmed by Wang Minjie, a scientist at the lab, via a social media post on China's WeChat. The lab was established by Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2018 and Wang stated that his team was being “dissolved due to strategic adjustments amid US-China tensions,” and reflected on the “golden era of foreign research labs” in China.",Blackrock has imposed new restrictions on company-issued devices for employees traveling to china.

US Citizenship test



Sweeping H-1B changes







The US citizenship test, officially known as the Naturalization test, is an examination that an applicant has to take to become a naturalized American citizen. This test is not for green card holders unless they are applying for citizenship. The new director of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Service said the existing test is too easy and the answers can be memorized. The Donald Trump administration is planning to bring back the 2020 version of the test.First, the applicants have to submit Form N-400 seeking for naturalization. They need to pass a background check and meet residency and other requirements. Then there have to attend an interview where they take two tests: English and a civic test.In the civic test, there are 100 questions; the officer asks the applicant 10 and the applicant must answer at least six correctly. During the first term of Donald Trump, there was a new rule for a very brief time where there are 128 questions; applicants are asked 20 and they must get at least 12 right. The USCIS is planning to bring back some version of this type of test.Before 2008, the test was random but the Bush administration introduced the 6 out of 10 questions benchmark.USCIS director said the present version is not really ""comforting with the spirit of the law"".The development regarding the US citizenship test comes as the Department of Homeland Security proposed sweeping changes for the H-1B visa program that allows US companies to hire foreign workers. According to the proposed changes, H-1B will not be for entry-level workers. It will be only for high-skilled jobs for which there will higher salary. If this becomes implemented, US graduates will not lose out jobs in the entry level and tech companies will not be able to hire foreign workers at a lower wage.",Uscis new director said the present us citizenship is easy and can be memorized.

Just exhuasted, but it was well worth it. The next step is to close the deal early by Aug 7.”The FCC’s decision, passed by a 2-1 vote, came just weeks after Paramount paid $16 million to settle a lawsuit filed by Donald Trump over a 2020 “60 Minutes” interview with then-vice president Kamala Harris, which the president claimed was deceptively edited to sway the 2024 election. While CBS denied the allegation, it chose to settle to avoid any delays to the merger.Crucial to gaining FCC approval were assurances from Ellison, son of Oracle founder Larry Ellison, and RedBird Capital that the new management would ensure unbiased journalism at CBS. The company has promised to appoint an independent ombudsman to oversee complaints related to editorial fairness and transparency, the New York Post reported.In a move seen as politically charged, Paramount also scrapped its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives to align with the Trump administration’s stance, which argues such policies amount to discrimination.“Americans no longer trust the legacy national news media to report fully, accurately, and fairly,” said FCC Chair Brendan Carr, a Trump appointee.""It is time for a change. That is why I welcome Skydance’s commitment to make significant changes at the once storied CBS broadcast network.""Dissenting FCC Commissioner Anna Gomez, the sole Democratic vote against the deal, condemned the decision, saying, “After months of cowardly capitulation to this administration, Paramount finally got what it wanted.”As part of the deal, Shari Redstone, the controlling shareholder of Paramount Global, will receive $1.75 billion in cash and step down from the company’s board. Her departure marks the end of the Redstone family’s direct influence over the media empire her father, Sumner Redstone, built.Skydance, known for producing hits like Top Gun: Maverick and Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning, will merge with Paramount to form “Paramount Skydance Corp.” The newly formed company will remain publicly traded but under the control of the Ellison family. David Ellison will serve as chairman and CEO, while former NBCUniversal boss Jeff Shell will become president.The FCC also approved the transfer of 28 CBS-owned TV station licences to the new company. This came shortly after CBS abruptly cancelled The Late Show with Stephen Colbert, citing financial reasons. The programme, despite strong ratings, was reportedly losing $40 million a year.Trump, who originally sued Paramount for $20 billion, claimed this week that the real settlement was closer to $36 million. The new owners committed $20 million to run pro-MAGA public service ads.The merger marks a dramatic turning point for Paramount, which has struggled in recent years with declining revenues and the challenges of streaming-era disruption. Redstone had initially reunited CBS and Viacom in 2019 in a bid to strengthen the company’s competitive footing, but the rapidly changing media landscape proved difficult to navigate.With the deal now approved, all eyes will be on Ellison and Skydance as they take the reins of one of America’s most iconic media brands.","The us federal communications commission (fcc) has officially approved the $8.4 billion merger between paramount global and skydance media.

NEW DELHI: Indian negotiators are targeting labour-intensive goods and services to boost India's tiny 1.9% share of UK imports. The new trade pact promises zero- or near-zero tariffs on textiles, leather and footwear, engineering goods, chemicals and pharmaceuticals - relief the government says will make Indian exports far more competitive.Government said 99% items of trade (called tariff lines), comprising 100% of India's exports, are covered in the deal.In textiles, for instance, there are 1,143 items on which zero-duty market access will be provided to Indian goods, blunting the duty advantage that Bangladesh, Cambodia and Pakistan have so far enjoyed. So, readymade garments or home textiles, carpets, handicrafts and traditional items such as pashmina shawls or Kanchipuram or bandhini sarees are expected to gain. India is fourth-largest textile supplier to UK, accounting for over 6% of imports.Government officials said India hopes to outperform competitors such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia, Turkey and Bangladesh in the footwear market, especially athleisure and sports shoes, in addition to Vellore and Kolhapuri chappals and traditional leather shoes. In recent years, several large sports shoe manufacturers have tied up with Indian producers to make footwear for brands like Puma, Adidas and New Balance for domestic and global markets.There are sectors where India has a large presence in other markets but a limited share of the British market. Indian exporters hope to replace competitors across a variety of engineering goods, including machinery and components, where zero-duty access will be provided to 1,659 items. With exports of $4.3 billion, India holds a small share of the $194 billion machinery imports by British businesses. Govt is projecting to double the value of exports by March 2030.India also has a small share in UK's pharma imports - only $1 billion out of $30 billion in 2024. The govt is eyeing gains in not just generics but also medical devices such as ECG machines and X-ray systems.For chemicals, where India's exports to UK were $570 million last year, the government is betting on a 30-40% jump in the first year itself as over 1,200 chemicals will be given duty-free access. Businesses are eyeing an opportunity in gems and jewellery sector, where exports are now pegged at $940 million.Although government has maintained that it has not opened several critical agricultural sectors such as dairy, apples, edible oil and oats under the Comprehensive Economic & Trade Agreement, it hopes to push Indian grapes, processed food, bakery items and marine products into UK supermarkets.A lot of the market access in these segments will also depend on the quality standards that the UK puts in place and also other trade deals that it enters into in the coming months.","Indian negotiators are targeting labour-intensive goods and services to boost india's tiny 1.9% share of uk imports.

NEW DELHI: The much-anticipated duty cuts for Scotch and gin is not happening overnight. While import duty will come down from 150% to 75%, it is unlikely to happen until at least the second half of 2035.That's because the agreement will take at least a year to be ratified by the British Parliament and there is a gradual tariff reduction roadmap starting with duties in India dropping to 110% in the first year of implementation. The UK government said customs duty will reduce to 40% over the next decade.What's more, govt has got the UK to agree to a minimum import price which means, whisky, gin or any other drink that costs under $5 in a one litre bottle or $6 in a 750 ml bottle will get the tariff benefit and the MIP will be indexed to inflation.However, industry officials say that despite halving import duty, the actual reduction of consumer prices will not be more than 10%. ""The share of customs duty to the overall structure of MRP is hardly 15-20%, depending on the category. The rest comprises state govrnment taxes, and distribution margins. So actual consumer prices will come down by only 8-10%,"" an official said.The reduction in import duty will be a benefit for manufacturers of Indian Made Foreign Liquor.Around 80% of imported scotch is in bulk form, which is used for bottling in India and for blending by local whisky brands.But the industry cheered the move. Sanjit Padhi, CEO of International Spirits and Wines Association of India (ISWAI), said the agreement paves the way for a more balanced and equitable trade environment, particularly as Indian alcohol exports to the UK have zero import duties.""We laud the Indian and British governments for formalising this historic treaty which will boost bilateral trade and positively impact the accessibility of premium Scotch whisky in India, reigniting growth and increased choice for Indian consumers,"" Praveen Someshwar, MD and CEO of Diageo India, said.","The much-anticipated duty cuts for scotch and gin is not happening overnight.

NEW DELHI: Government has agreed to cut tariffs on thousands of products imported from UK - from chocolates and cosmetics to cars, silver and Scotch - but reduction and elimination of customs duties will not translate into the entire benefit being passed on to consumers.To begin with, customs duty is only the basic cost of the landed price for an Indian seller. On top of that are local levies - GST or excise - which even an Indian manufacturer has to pay. And, this can be a significant portion of the final price.Take the case of alcohol, for instance, where the landed price of a bottle of the popular Johnnie Walker Black Label is estimated at around Rs 350, which at 150% customs duty sees a levy of Rs 525. On top of that, there is a 200% margin for the importer, the company, in most cases - which means an addition of around Rs 750 - taking the landed price to Rs 1,275. Then comes excise of 85% or Rs 1,084 and VAT of 25% (Rs 590), taking the wholesale price to Rs 2,950. Then comes the retail margin, pushing the cost in a market like Delhi to over Rs 3,000 a bottle.The actual price reduction for a customer will only be Rs 200-300 a bottle, a top industry executive told TOI while predicting a higher margin for companies.That's especially true for Made-in-India whisky, which blend anywhere between 1% and 25-30% Scotch imported in bulk form. ""Going forward, for several MNCs operating in India, bottling in India may not be a great idea and they will simply import bottles of blended whisky,"" the source said.A similar situation is likely to play out in other sectors such as cosmetics too, where companies will see improved margins, said marketing executives. There is no mechanism for govt to ensure the full benefit is passed on. Although it tried to ensure the window is no longer available under GST and in any case, companies dragged authorities to court, questioning the calculations.In segments such as automobiles, competition from players will drive pricing behaviour, as will other trade agreements. For instance, with the EU deal in the pipeline, a German carmaker or Tesla may just lower domestic prices significantly to grab a bigger pie of the market.With duty reduction in several segments staggered over 10 years, price cuts are not on the immediate horizon.","Customs duty is only the basic cost of the landed price for an indian seller.

NEW DELHI: India finally relaxed its highly-controlled duty rates on imported cars with the UK trade deal paving the way for customs charges to come down from the highs of 100%+ to as low as 10%, benefitting ultra-luxury car brands such as Jaguar and Land Rover, Rolls-Royce, Bentley and Aston Martin.However, the government has delayed the import duty concessions when it comes to electrics and other green cars, the measure being initiated to protect the domestic players who are looking to produce high-value clean cars. “There are no concessions given to electrics, hybrids, and hydrogen-powered vehicles in the first five years,” an official said.In petrol and diesel categories, the lower tariffs can be enjoyed for a limited number of vehicles as the government has imposed quotas and limits to protect the domestic makers and also curb mass-scale shipments.For large-engine petrol cars above 3000 cc and diesel cars over 2500 cc — traditionally luxury imports — India has committed to lowering the current 100%+ customs duty to 10% over 15 years, within a quota starting at 10,000 units and rising to 19,000 in year five, according to a review document of Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI).For mid-sized cars (1500–2500 cc diesel / up to 3000 cc petrol), a 50% in-quota duty applies initially, falling to 10% by year five.Small cars under 1500 cc follow a similar tariff reduction path with a growing quota. “These in-quota vehicles enjoy sharply reduced duties, while out-of-quota imports still face tariffs ranging from 95% to 50%, depending on vehicle size and year,” GTRI said.In electrics, market access has been given mostly in the high price segment of vehicles priced above £80,000 (around Rs 94 lakh). “For vehicles priced below £40,000, no market access provided, ensuring complete protection for the mass-market EV segment in which India seeks global leadership,” the official said.While the duty cuts will happen only once the UK Parliament approves the agreement (possibly by the middle of next year), analysts believe that the duty reduction with the UK may pave the way for similar measures with other countries and trading blocs as well. “This is India’s first-ever auto tariff concession in any FTA, and it’s likely to trigger similar demands from Japan, the EU, South Korea, and the U.S.,” GTRI said.“By year five, up to 37,000 UK-built ICE vehicles could enter India annually at just 10% duty — far below the current base rate of 110%. This creates a preferential entry path for high-end British brands… but also for other UK-based exports. While the measure is capped in volume and spread over 15 years, the policy sets a precedent in opening India’s tightly controlled automobile market to bilateral trade partners—potentially triggering similar demands in future FTAs. ”",India finally relaxed its highly-controlled duty rates on imported cars.

The launch, powered by water pressure, shows the rocket soaring into the sky, separating mid-air, and deploying a parachute for a safe landing. A video of the launch has gone viral, drawing widespread admiration for the students’ creativity, teamwork, and technical skills.The video was shared on X by user Tansu Yegen with the caption, “In China, students made a two-stage rocket using a cola bottle and water pressure.Since being posted, the clip has garnered over 1.2 million views.Using basic materials like plastic bottles and water, the students engineered a rocket based on air and water pressure principles. In the launch, the first stage propelled the rocket upward using pressurized water.At a certain altitude, the second stage separated and continued its ascent using stored pressure. A parachute then deployed, allowing the rocket to descend safely, demonstrating complex physics concepts such as Newton’s laws of motion, air resistance, and pressure.Social media users, particularly from India, flooded the comments with praise and introspection.One user wrote, “And we are still struggling with basic education and basic necessities for our citizens,” while another said, “Aur hamare yaha ke bacche..”A retired engineering teacher added to the discussion, saying, “I’ve probably seen 5,000 water rocket launches in the past 25 years.
