MV tax only for use in public area: SC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mv-tax-only-for-use-in-public-area-sc/articleshow/123608381.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court has held that the motor vehicles tax, which is imposed for use of public places and infrastructure, cannot be levied if a vehicle does not use the same.""Motor vehicle tax is compensatory in nature. It has a direct nexus with the end use. The rationale for levy of motor vehicle tax is that a person who is using public infrastructure, such as roads, highways etc. has to pay for such usage. Legislature has consciously used the expression 'public place' in Section 3. If a motor vehicle is not used in a 'public place' or not kept for use in a 'public place' then the person concerned is not deriving benefit from the public infrastructure; therefore, he should not be burdened with the motor vehicle tax for such period,"" a bench of Justices Manoj Misra and Ujjal Bhuyan said. The bench passed the order while interpreting the Andhra Pradesh Motor Vehicle Taxation Act, whose section 3 says govt may from time to time direct that a tax shall be levied on every motor vehicle used or kept for use in a public place in the State.It thereby allowed the plea of a company which had pleaded that it was not liable to pay tax as its vehicles were used in the central dispatch yard premises belonging to Visakhapatnam Steel Plant of Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL) and were not plying on public roads.The state had taken the stand that actual use or non-use of public roads cannot be a ground for escaping tax liability. The bench said the taxable event under Section 3 arises when a vehicle is used or kept for use in a public place in the State.""Therefore, the tax is on the user or intendment for use of motor vehicle in a 'public place'. Thus, if a vehicle is actually used in a 'public place' or kept in such a way that it is intended to be used in a 'public place' then the tax liability accrues.... Requirement of law is that the motor vehicle should be used or kept for use in a 'public place'. When admittedly the motor vehicles of the appellant were confined for use within the RINL premises which is a closed area then the question of vehicles being used or kept for being used in a 'public place' does not arise,"" it said.The court said the motor vehicles in question were used or kept for use only within the restricted premises of RINL, which was not a public place. ""Therefore, the said vehicles are not liable to be taxed for the period the said vehicles were used or kept for use within the restricted premises of RINL. Argument of the respondent that appellant had not intimated non-use of the motor vehicles in terms of Rule 12A does not carry much persuasion in view of what we have discussed supra. Thus, even in the absence of any intimation in terms of Rule 12A, motor vehicles of the appellant cannot be subjected to motor vehicle tax for the period those were used or kept confined within restricted premises of RINL"".",Justices: motor vehicle tax is compensatory in nature. It has a direct nexus with the end use. A company had pleaded that it was not liable to pay tax as its vehicles were used in the central dispatch yard premises belonging to visakhapatnam steel plant.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123608382,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1532675,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
"Indian visitors to US in June dip over previous yr's numbers for 1st time since 2001, except in Covid period",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-visitors-to-us-in-june-dip-over-previous-yrs-numbers-for-1st-time-since-2001-except-in-covid-period/articleshow/123608362.cms,"Indians With Valid US Visas Can Now Easily Travel To Argentina Without Needing Any Additional Visa

NEW DELHI: India's peak outbound travel month of June saw a decline in the number of Indian visitors to the US in 2025 over the previous year for the first time this millennium, barring the Covid period.With 2.1 lakh Indians headed to America in June, the number was 8% lower than 2.3 lakh in same month last year, according to data from the US commerce deptartmen's National Travel and Tourism Office (NTTO). The provisional figure for this July shows a 5.5% fall over the same month last year.Overall, the US has been seeing a decline in international visitors - and not just from India - in recent months. NTTO says the total non-US resident international visitor volume to the US decreased 6.2% in June 2025 over June 2024, 7% in May, 8% in March, and 1.9% in Feb. This Jan saw a 4.7% increase over same period last year, and April was up 1.3%.India is the fourth-largest source market for international visitors for the US. Since the two biggest source markets - Mexico and Canada - share a land border, India is the second-biggest overseas source market, with the UK being the largest. ""Combined, these top five source markets (Brazil being the fifth) accounted for 59.4% of total international arrivals"" this June, says NTTO.While travel industry biggies here say it is too early to pin the blame for the fall in Indian visitor numbers on the stricter visa regime adopted by Donald Trump in his second presidency, the impact could be more pronounced going ahead if the same continues. The reason: the US mostly issues 10-year-validity multiple entry visitor and business visas (B1/B2) so people who already have them can keep travelling. But if new visas get impacted for reasons like long appointment times or stricter issuance norms, then with a time lag impact will be visible.""We are seeing a visible impact on the student segment this year due to delay in visa issuance even after people securing college admissions. Historically, the biggest categories of visitors headed from India to the US have been visiting friends and relatives, business and students. The US was never a top leisure destination for Indians. That space has been led by Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Europe. North America came after that. Right now, apart from students, we are not seeing a dramatic impact on the other segments. But if new visa issuances are affected, they will also be hit with a certain time lag,"" said a travel agent.With Indian diaspora of over 50 lakh, the US sees great demand for travel from the US.","India's peak outbound travel month of june saw a decline in the number of indian visitors to the us in 2025 over the previous year for the first time this millennium.

NEW DELHI: The country’s first barrier-free tolling system (Multi-Lane Free Flow or MLFF) will be rolled out at Gharaunda toll plaza on Delhi-Chandigarh highway and at Choryasi plaza on NH-48 in Gujarat, with the Indian Highway Management Company Ltd (IHMCL) under NHAI signing agreements with ICICI Bank for the purpose.Six more toll plazas, including five in Delhi and the National Capital Region (NCR), are likely to see the rollout of MLFF in the next two months. The five plazas in NCR set to introduce MLFF – at UER-II, Dwarka E-way and Pachgaon, Shahajahanpur, Manoharpur and Daulatpur on NH-48 – in the next two months will make travel from Haryana and Delhi to Jaipur seamless.Sources said the toll rates for UER-II and Dwarka E-way are being finalised.MLFF aims to provide highway users a seamless and barrier-free tolling experience. The system works through a combination of high-performance RFID readers and automatic number plate recognition (ANPR) cameras, which scan FASTags and vehicle registration numbers to enable electronic transactions. Thus, vehicles won’t need to stop at toll plazas, easing congestion and saving time.NHAI officials said the new tolling mechanism will be introduced at 25 NH plazas during this year and the process to identify them has started.

Taco Bell CTO admits AI cannot work everywhere; says company now reconsidering where and where not to use the AI going forward,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/taco-bell-cto-admits-ai-cannot-work-everywhere-says-company-now-reconsidering-where-and-where-not-to-use-the-ai-going-forward/articleshow/123605121.cms,"Representative Image

What Taco Bell CTO said about using AI in the company’s operations



“Like many people, sometimes it falls short, but other times it really impresses me,”

“For our teams, we’ll help coach them: at your restaurant, at these times, we recommend you use voice AI or recommend that you actually really monitor voice AI and jump in as necessary,”

“I can tell you it’s a very active conversation inside Taco Bell in partnership with our franchisees. I think at the end of the day, it’s really, really early. And we feel that. And I think other brands feel that, too,”

Taco Bell is reconsidering its use of artificial intelligence (AI) for food ordering. This decision from the American fast food chain came after its new voice AI system, which has been installed at over 500 drive-thru locations across the US, received mixed reviews. The company's Chief Digital and Technology Officer, Dane Mathews , admitted they are ""learning a lot"" from the experience. The voice AI has been met with social media complaints about glitches, delays, and general customer discomfort. Some users have also been intentionally ""trolling"" the system with unusual orders, such as asking for “18,000 cups of water.”In an interview with the Wall Street Journal, Mathews described his experience with the technology as inconsistent.he said.He added that he is now considering more carefully when it makes sense to rely on the technology. Using AI at every drive-through may not always be practical, he noted. Matthews also pointed out that in busy locations with long lines, a human staff member could manage the situation more effectively.Mathews added that he plans to work with restaurants to help them navigate the decision.he explained.However, Taco Bell is still refining its plans while reviewing data from over two million customer orders handled by AI.Matthews highlighted.Nearly three years into the generative AI wave, companies are still testing and revising their strategies, unsure of where the technology fits best. However, drive-through voice AI remains a challenge.McDonald’s dropped its IBM trial and is now working with Google Cloud, while Wendy’s is also expanding its FreshAi system built on Google tech. On the other hand, Taco Bell’s parent, Yum Brands, has partnered with Nvidia to explore potential AI applicattions.","Taco bell is reconsidering its use of artificial intelligence (ai) for food ordering.

Ellison once offered an interesting tribute to Bill Gates and praised his unmatched business drive, while candidly acknowledging that Gates may not be the smartest person in tech, but he is the most relentless. In a 2011 interview with TellTaleStory, Larry Ellison said, “Bill, forgive me, there are a lot of people in the world smarter than Bill Gates.

Ellison added that he completely impressed with his unwavering stamina and ambition. He also went ahead and linked Gates with industrial titan John D. Rockefeller , saying, “If he were Edison, he’d be less dangerous. He is utterly relentless… he wants it all.”The remarks by Oracle founder underscores Bill Gates reputation as a powerhouse.

The WhatsApp Scam That Gives Hackers Your Phone!

WhatsApp has said that it uncovered a cyberespionage , or hacking, operation that exploited multiple security vulnerabilities across its platform and Apple devices to conduct targeted surveillance of users, with reportedly civil society activists appearing to be among the primary targets. In a statement issued, the Meta-owned company said that it has plugged the loop holes that hackers used to attack specific users.“Incomplete authorization of linked device synchronization messages in WhatsApp for iOS prior to v2.25.21.73, WhatsApp Business for iOS v2.25.21.78, and WhatsApp for Mac v2.25.21.78 could have allowed an unrelated user to trigger processing of content from an arbitrary URL on a target’s device,” WhatsApp said in a statement.The Meta-owned messaging service disclosed the security breach in a brief statement, revealing that hackers had discovered and weaponised a chain of vulnerabilities that allowed them to compromise both the WhatsApp application and Apple devices in coordinated attacks.“We assess that this vulnerability, in combination with an OS-level vulnerability on Apple platforms (CVE-2025-43300), may have been exploited in a sophisticated attack against specific targeted users,” the company added, without revealing much about the cyber attack.However, a report by news agency Reuters said that an estimated 200 users worldwide have potentially been compromised during the espionage campaign.Donncha O Cearbhaill, who heads Amnesty International's Security Lab, said that members of civic organisations appear to be among those affected by the surveillance operation.“WhatsApp has just sent out a round of threat notifications to individuals they believe where targeted by an advanced spyware campaign in past 90 days. Seek out expert help if you have received this alert,” he said.“Early indications are that the WhatsApp attack is impacting both iPhone and Android users, civil society individuals among them. Government spyware continues to pose a threat to journalists and human rights defenders,” O Cearbhaill wrote in a post on social media platform X.He noted that the Apple vulnerability was in a core image library, advising people that they should update their devices and enable iOS Lockdown Mode or Android‘s Advanced Protection Mode to help protect against attacks like this.","Amnesty international's security lab says civic organisations may be a target of the cyber attack.

Former GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke had defended Microsoft 's controversial internal memo requiring managers to evaluate employees based on their AI tool usage , arguing that measuring artificial intelligence adoption should focus on cultural alignment rather than quantifiable metrics like code generation. Speaking on the ""Decoder"" podcast that aired August 7, Dohmke explained that simply counting AI-generated lines of code would be ""easily gamified"" and miss the broader point of fostering an AI-forward organizational mindset. Instead, he emphasized that evaluation should center on whether employees demonstrate willingness to learn and integrate AI tools into their workflow.The former GitHub executive backed a June memo from Julia Liuson, president of Microsoft's developer tools division, which stated that ""using AI is no longer optional"" and should be part of managers' performance evaluations. Business Insider first reported on the internal directive earlier this year.Cultural transformation over metricsDohmke characterized the Microsoft memo as ""totally fair game"" for 2025, suggesting that companies should expect employees to reflect on their AI learning and usage of tools like GitHub Copilot, Microsoft Copilot, and Teams Copilot for meeting summaries.The former CEO drew parallels to GitHub's company culture during his tenure, where every employee across all departments—from HR to sales to legal—was required to use GitHub's platform. He made clear that employees uncomfortable with this requirement could find opportunities at ""tens of thousands of other tech companies.""Dohmke described the evaluation process as ""more nuanced"" than simple usage tracking, focusing instead on meaningful conversations between managers and employees about AI learning and adoption. This approach, he argued, aligned with Microsoft's growth-oriented culture that prioritizes continuous learning and adaptation during his time leading GitHub.The stance reflects broader industry shifts toward mandatory AI integration, with companies increasingly viewing artificial intelligence proficiency as essential for competitive advantage rather than optional technological enhancement.","Github ceo thomas dohmke defended microsoft's controversial internal memo.

Apple iPhone 17 series will launch on September 9. The Cupertino-based company has scheduled an ‘Awe Dropping’ event for 10:30pm next month where it will unveil 2025 iPhone lineup that may include four models, namely iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro, iPhone 17 Pro Max and a slim model rumoured to be called iPhone 17 Plus. ahead of the launch, a new leak has appeared online which says that Apple is also planning to bring a new accessory this year. Tipster Majin Bu says that the company may bring Crossbody Strap, designed primarily for iPhone 17 cases.The upcoming Crossbody Strap is said to feature a flexible metal core to make it fully magnetic along its entire length. Rings at the ends will be polarized opposite to the strap, locking the system firmly for a strong grip. This design makes attaching and removing easy without using hooks or loops, offering a practical option for iPhone 17 cases.The leakster adds that the strap could also be compatible with AirPods Pro 3, expanding its range of uses. The report also shares samples of the upcoming strap which shows a woven nylon body, similar to that used in Sport Loop Bands. Apple may introduce a silicone variant as well. The upcoming iPhone accessory is rumoured to be offered in multiple colour options.Apple’s upcoming iPhone 17 series is expected to feature display sizes similar to the current lineup, with the iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max retaining their 6.3-inch and 6.9-inch screens. The new iPhone 17 Air is likely to sit between these two in size. The screen size of the standard iPhone 17 may grow to 6.3 inches, matching the Pro model.Early reports hinted that the slimmer iPhone 17 Air might be a premium device priced higher than the Pro Max. However, sources now indicate it will be a mid-range model, cheaper than both the Pro and Pro Max but more expensive than the standard iPhone 17. This positions it as a direct replacement for the “Plus” model, offering a middle ground in size and price.All four iPhone 17 models are expected to get ProMotion display technology with a 120Hz refresh rate for smoother scrolling and video playback, a feature that was earlier exclusive to Pro models. This upgrade will be made possible by LTPO OLED panels. While LTPO displays also allow for an always-on screen, it is not yet confirmed if this feature will come to all models or remain Pro-only.For the Pro versions, Apple may replace titanium with aluminum for part of the frame, while keeping glass for MagSafe charging. This could result in a half-glass, half-aluminum build that improves durability. A new horizontal pill-shaped camera bump may replace the current square design, with the iPhone 17 Air also tipped to adopt this layout.Powering the iPhone 17 lineup is expected to be Apple’s new A19 Pro chip, built using TSMC’s latest 3nm process for improved speed and power efficiency. For the first time, iPhones could come with 12GB of RAM, allowing smoother multitasking and enabling advanced Apple Intelligence AI features.All iPhone models set to launch in 2025 are rumored to get a major front camera upgrade, moving from the 12-megapixel lens in the iPhone 16 series to a new 24-megapixel sensor. This improvement is expected to deliver sharper photos and allow users to crop images without losing detail.The iPhone 17 Pro Max is tipped to be the first iPhone with three 48-megapixel rear cameras — a Wide, an Ultra Wide, and a Tetraprism Telephoto lens — and may also support 8K video recording for the first time. The iPhone 17 Air is expected to come with a single 48-megapixel rear camera, while the standard iPhone 17 will likely feature a dual-lens setup with Wide and Ultra Wide cameras.The Pro models could introduce a mechanical aperture, allowing users to adjust how much light enters the camera for better control over depth-of-field — a first for iPhones, which currently use fixed apertures. They might also add dual video recording, letting users film with both the front and rear cameras at the same time, a feature popular with content creators but currently limited to some third-party apps.The iPhone 17 Pro and Pro Max will continue to offer a 5x Telephoto optical zoom, which will remain exclusive to the Pro lineup. The standard iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Air will not include Telephoto lenses or 5x zoom capabilities.Apple is also said to be working on a 3-year iPhone overhaul strategy with a foldable iPhone coming in 2026.",Apple's iphone 17 series is expected to launch on september 9.

Teen prodigy Kairan Quazi is trading rocket science for Wall Street , leaving SpaceX to join billionaire Ken Griffin 's Citadel Securities as a quantitative developer at just 16 years old. The move marks a significant career pivot for the engineering wunderkind who became the youngest SpaceX employee in company history.""After two years at SpaceX, I felt ready to take on new challenges and expand my skill set into a different high-performance environment,"" Kairan Quazi told Business Insider. ""Citadel Securities offered a similarly ambitious culture, but also a completely new domain, which is very exciting for me.""Kairan Quazi starts this week at the systematic trading giant's New York City office, where he'll work on global trading infrastructure at the intersection of engineering and quantitative problem-solving, according to Business Insider.Despite receiving offers from leading AI laboratories and major tech companies, Kairan Quazi chose quantitative finance for its unique combination of intellectual challenge and immediate feedback. ""Quant finance offers a pretty rare combination: the complexity and intellectual challenge that AI research also provides, but with a much faster pace,"" he explained to Business Insider.At Citadel Securities, Kairan Quazi expects to see measurable impact in days rather than the months or years typical in research environments. The decision represents a notable recruiting win for the trading firm, which competes intensely with AI companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI for top talent.Kairan Quazi's journey began when he skipped from third grade directly to college at age 9. By 10, he was interning at Intel Labs , and at 11, he transferred to Santa Clara University, eventually becoming their youngest graduate in 172 years.SpaceX hired Kairan Quazi at 14 to work on production-critical Starlink satellite systems, where he designed software determining satellite beam targeting for millions of customers. ""I had a very broad scope and a lot of responsibility, especially for a junior engineer,"" Kairan Quazi told Business Insider.The Bangladeshi-American teenager will live within walking distance of Citadel Securities' Manhattan office, eliminating his previous need for his mother to drive him to work in Washington state. His mother's background as an investment banker provided early exposure to finance, making the transition feel natural despite his engineering roots, the report said.",Kairan quazi was the youngest spacex employee in company history.

Nvidia on 15% US government ‘cut’

Nvidia reported a revenue of $46.7 billion during the second quarter of its fiscal year 2026. This marked a 6% increase from the previous quarter and a 56% jump year-over-year. In an interview with Yahoo Finance following the company’s earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that the US tech companies can’t be left out of the Chinese market adding that they need to serve as a worldwide standard similar to the US dollar. Jensen Huang said “[President Trump] understands that the American tech stack should be the world standard. Just as the American dollar is the world standard that economies are built on, we want the American tech stack for the world’s technology and industries to be built on, and that includes China.”Speaking about the restoration of sales to China, the CEO of the world's most valuable company said that Nvidia is getting the engine “fired back up” and already has licenses from the US government. “We’ve been approved and licensed to be able to ship to China, and now we’re looking for orders in China,” Jensen Huang added.Explaining further, Huang said “We have every opportunity to succeed in the China market, if they would allow for American technology companies to be able to play there. And so I’m hoping things will get sorted out”.During the interview, Huang also touched upon the opportunity in the networking space. “Just our ethernet product line grew to an annualized rate of $10 billion, and that’s just gotten started. Networking is going to be a very big part of our business. That’s fundamentally recognizing the fusion of computing, networking, and software,” Huang said.During the company’s earnings call, Nvidia CFO Colette Kress said the company is still waiting for the Trump administration to finalize an agreement under which Nvidia will pay the US government a 15% share of its sales in China.CEO Jensen Huang added that while Nvidia is in talks with the administration on China, it is not considering the kind of deal Intel made with Washington. “Nor has that come up in discussions,” Huang said.In a Fox Business Network interview, Huang said: ""I don't know that it's 'forced to say yes,' but ultimately, it's in the best interest of the world, of our country, for us to be able to sell in China"" .""So whatever it takes to get it approved for us to be able to sell in China is fine with us,"" he added.",N nvidia reported a revenue of $46.7 billion during the second quarter of its fiscal year 2026.

Why was Princess Diana’s time capsule sealed

Public and historical significance





A rare glimpse into the world of the early 1990s has been unlocked with the opening of a time capsule once linked to Princess Diana. Sealed more than three decades ago, the capsule has unveiled a fascinating collection of cultural artefacts and personal memorabilia that vividly capture the spirit of the era. From music and fashion to everyday consumer objects, the discoveries offer an intimate reflection of the time Diana lived through and the broader cultural landscape of the early ‘90s. The opening of the capsule has not only sparked renewed public curiosity about her life and legacy but also rekindled interest in the social history of a decade still fondly remembered today.The capsule’s contents painted a vivid picture of the early 1990s. Among the most striking discoveries was a Kylie Minogue CD, reflecting Diana’s well-known interest in contemporary music and her connection with pop culture. A small pocket-sized television symbolised the rapid shift in consumer technology at the time, when portable gadgets were becoming increasingly popular. Old newspapers preserved inside offered insights into the political and social debates of 1991, while glossy magazines highlighted the fashion trends that Diana herself helped popularise.Each artefact collectively recreated a snapshot of an era when Diana stood at the centre of both royal life and international celebrity culture.The creation of the time capsule was intended to preserve the essence of the moment for posterity. By capturing artefacts from 1991, the capsule became a curated window into Diana’s world—a year that marked both personal challenges and public triumphs for her. Historians suggest it was designed to reflect not only her personal interests but also the broader social and cultural context that defined the early 1990s. At a time when Diana was reshaping the image of the monarchy through her openness and relatability, the capsule stands as a symbolic act of remembrance, preserving tangible fragments of a rapidly changing world.The opening of the capsule has generated fascination far beyond royal enthusiasts. For the public, the contents stir nostalgia for a decade often remembered with fondness and curiosity. For historians, the capsule provides a rare cultural archive, bridging the gap between Diana’s personal story and broader historical currents. Newspapers and magazines inside the capsule act as valuable primary sources, allowing future generations to study not only Diana’s era but also the everyday concerns, entertainment, and technology of the time. It highlights how deeply Diana was embedded in the cultural fabric, not as a distant royal figure but as someone closely tied to global popular culture.The capsule has once again brought Diana’s enduring influence to the forefront. While the items inside may appear ordinary at first glance, their rediscovery has reminded the world of how extraordinary Diana’s presence was during her lifetime. The findings continue to inspire both nostalgia and admiration, proving that Diana’s legacy transcends time and generations.",The capsule’s contents painted a vivid picture of the early 1990s.

A video from Birmingham has gone viral after capturing a woman, identified online as an Indian student, demanding £20 (about Rs 2,300) from a car owner after wiping his window.The clip shows the student approaching a parked vehicle, cleaning the glass, and insisting on payment. Surprised by the demand, the car owner recorded the incident and uploaded it to social media, where it has now crossed two million views.In the footage, the owner is heard asking, “for what?” when the student demands £20. She replies, “I just cleaned your window,” prompting him to respond, “you just did a quick wipe. Look, I’m confused – £20?” To this, she insists, “yeah, I mean that is the cost of living.”The exchange escalates as the student blocks the car, warning, “You will have to knock me if you want to leave,” and refusing to let him go without paying. The owner then calls her a “robber,” saying, “this is what robbers look like nowadays apparently.”The video has triggered sharp reactions online, with many users labeling it as “scripted” or “staged” for social media engagement. One user wrote, “Isn’t she the same girl who hit a parked car for insurance, just realised even that was staged.” Another commented, “Staged, this girl appeared in so many videos like this. But it’s not cool as she is damaging the image of India and many people don’t know that it’s just an act. ”Such staged “street encounter” clips, according to users, have become a rising trend on social media, blurring the line between authentic incidents and content created purely for clout.","A video from birmingham has gone viral after capturing a woman, identified online as an indian student, demanding £20.
