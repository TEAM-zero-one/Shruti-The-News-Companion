‘Aviation emissions controlneeds strong action by govt’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/aviation-emissions-controlneeds-strong-action-by-govt/articleshow/121604852.cms,"The success of the global aviation carbon offsetting scheme hinges on govts stepping up to the challenge, said International Air Transport Association (IATA) director general Willie Walsh on Wednesday. As airlines brace for the mandatory offsetting of a portion of international flight emissions from Jan 2027, the big question is whether govts will be able to provide enough carbon credits for airlines to purchase and offset the emissions. Offsetting will put a financial burden on airlines, including those from India. However, the current problem for the airline industry is the dearth of purchase options.""If CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) doesn't work the way it should, it won't be because of a lack of action on the part of airlines; it will be because of a lack of action on the part of govts to make credits available,"" said Walsh.""We've been talking to govts and we have realised that many of them do not understand their obligation under the ICAO-CORSIA agreement to make eligible units available to us. (ICAO stands for International Civil Aviation Organization.) We're seeing more and more countries now acknowledge that there is a need to play their part, but also acknowledge that this is an opportunity. There are some credits available, but the volume that is required is going to ramp up significantly.We've highlighted this to ICAO. Our obligation is to buy and redeem carbon credits; their obligation is to make it available. We can't fulfil our obligation on this if govts in the first place don't fulfil theirs,"" he said.While Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) production will double to 2 million tons in 2025, it will only meet 0.7% of airline fuel needs, said IATA. ""CORSIA must be successful. It is a credible and verifiable system that requires carbon credits of only the highest standard, making its positive impact on climate unquestionable. But, more govts need to join Guyana, which, to date, is the only state to certify credits for airlines to purchase,"" said Walsh. ""These actions must be accompanied by ringing the alarm bells on SAF production. We need more effective leadership. For govts, that means delivering policy actions and certainty, preferably production incentives, that have a track record of success. Meanwhile, companies that can produce SAF must stop procrastinating and get to work at ramping up production capacity.""","The success of the global aviation carbon offsetting scheme hinges on govts stepping up to the challenge, says iata director general willie walsh.

2.5 crore 'bogus' IDs solve case of vanishing tickets on IRCTC site,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/2-5cr-bogus-ids-solve-case-of-vanishing-tickets-on-irctc-site/articleshow/121606882.cms,"NEW DELHI: If you have been baffled by how and why railway tickets in certain trains disappear within minutes of the booking window opening even 60 days before the scheduled journey, IRCTC has detected those behind creating this artificial crisis. Only in the past five months, it detected 2.9 lakh suspicious PNRs while analysing ticket purchases done within just five minutes after booking commenced for both general and Tatkal tickets.Top railway officials said between Janand May, they have deactivated 2.5 crore suspected user IDs for booking tickets and put 20 lakh user IDs under revalidation as a part of a special drive. ""A total of 134 complaints have been registered with the national cyber crime portal and over 6,800 disposal email domains have been blocked. This drive will be intensified further,"" said an official.Disposable email addressing refers to an approach that involves using a unique email address for each contact or entity, or using it for a limited number of times or uses. The fraudsters have been resorting to these tactics to book tickets and charge more from unwary passengers.Sources said the problem of all tickets getting booked quickly is confined to certain routes and trains.""So, the focus is on weeding out users who are beating the system. Passengers can't be blamed as there is a genuine shortage of confirmed tickets. So, the effort has been to increase capacity and to run more trains, particularly during peak travel seasons,"" said an official.Officials claimed that IRCTC has taken ""systemic measures"" including engagement of leading content delivering network and anti-BOT applications - security techniques used to distinguish between genuine human users and automated bots or scripts - with cutting edge technology to ensure a smooth booking process for genuine travellers.The officials added that the railways' ticketing and catering arm achieved its highest ever per minute booking of 31,814 tickets on May 22, 2025 at 10am.""Attempt versus booking ratio has increased from 43.1% to 62.2% between Oct 2024 and May 2025,"" said an official. He added that none of the travel platforms can guarantee confirmed ticket bookings and hence people should not fall prey to them.However, certain B2C (business to consumer) sites charge a premium and offer 3X refund in specific cases.","Irctc detected 2.9 lakh suspicious pnrs while analysing ticket purchases done within just five minutes after booking commenced for both general and tatkal tickets.

"‘For every seat we sell, there are probably 10 takers,’ says Emirates president as Dubai bilaterals not revised for years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/for-every-seat-we-sell-there-are-probably-10-takers-says-emirates-president-as-dubai-bilaterals-not-revived-for-years/articleshow/121549276.cms,"NEW DELHI: Emirates does not see the huge transit business the mega carrier gets at its Dubai hub from flights to and from India getting impacted by the expansion of Air India and with IndiGo launching long hauls to Europe from next month. The reason: India has so far not acceded to Dubai’s request for increasing the long-exhausted bilaterals or flying rights. As a result, airlines of both India and Dubai are operating the maximum possible flights under the current air service agreement (ASA), with no room to add services till the bilaterals are revised.“We’ve been stuck with 65,000 seats in each direction (Dubai-India and vice-versa) for just over 11 years now (during which period the demand for travel has grown exponentially). For every seat we sell, there are probably 10 takers. So I don’t see getting impacted by IndiGo and Air India expansion plans. In fact, there probably be a major relief valve for the pent up demand that has been in India for decades. Frankly, good luck to AI and IndiGo with getting airplanes at the pace they need,” Emirates Airlines president Tim Clark said Sunday in Delhi, where he is among the global aviation leaders attending the IATA AGM.Stressing the need for more bilaterals, he said: “Fifteen years ago, the population to Dubai was about 25 lakh. This is over 80 lakh. Dubai is one of the fastest growing cities in the world and 40% of the ethnic mix is of Indian origin. If you look at the way the Indian community has moved to and from Dubai over the last 10 or 11 years, you can see the scale of what is not happening by not giving seats to Emirates or wherever else it may be. The Indian government has a policy at the moment of restricting capacity of foreign carriers into India, and they have their own reasons for that.”Clark said he hopes “this will change when (India) realises the significance, the criticality of air transport as a wealth multiplier for their own economy. After all, it's been a it's been a catalyst for so many economies in the last 20-30 years,” he said.India is planning to have aviation hubs at its airports like Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru. “You have to have open access. We (Dubai) have got 80 lakh and we can make a hub out of it. So you have every opportunity on the planet to make a hub and make it very good with your 1.4 billion population. But if you have these sorts of restrictive practices (bilaterals), it doesn't make much sense when you look at the other aspects of Indian economy which are expanding,” he said.He said since the existing bilaterals have been exhausted, there is no possibility of Emirates starting flights to the upcoming airports in India like Navi Mumbai and Greater Noida.",Emirates does not see the huge transit business the mega carrier gets at its dubai hub from flights to and from india getting impacted by the expansion of air india and indigo.

NEW DELHI: The launch of the Axiom mission, which will carry Indian astronaut-designate Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla to the International Space Station, has been postponed to June 10, it was announced on Tuesday.“The Ax4 crew is scheduled to launch to the International Space Station on June 10 at 8:22 AM EDT from Launch Complex 39A at NASAKennedy,” Axiom Space posted on X.The mission, part of Axiom Space's Ax-4 programme, was originally slated for take-off on May 29 and then rescheduled for June 8, but operational adjustments and quarantine protocols have now led to the launch date being pushed to June 10.During a virtual press conference, Shukla said the Ax-4 crew will interact with school students, educators and members of the Indian space industry. “For the people of India, this mission is a milestone and I request India to pray for its success. Even stars are attainable, Jai Hind,” he said, adding that he would be carrying Indian delicacies such as mango nectar, moong dal halwa and carrot halwa on the space flight.PM Narendra Modi is expected to interact with the Ax-4 crew during their 14-day stay at the ISS. “We will have one with an Indian VVIP,” Shukla said to a question on interaction with the PM from space.Shukla, who will serve as the mission’s pilot, is set to make history as the first Indian to visit the ISS and only the second Indian in space—following Rakesh Sharma’s iconic 1984 mission. The Ax-4 crew includes mission commander Peggy Whitson, a veteran Nasa astronaut, and specialists Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski from Poland and Tibor Kapu from Hungary.Shukla will be the second Indian to travel to space four decades after Rakesh Sharma's iconic spaceflight onboard Russia's Soyuz spacecraft in 1984.On Tuesday, space minister Jitendra Singh announced that Group Capt Shukla will study physical, cognitive and physiological responses in space, as well as the impact of utilising continuous electronic displays in microgravity, an important issue for future long-duration space missions. Further, Shukla’s research will focus on skeletal muscle dysfunction in space and the evaluation of therapeutic strategies to counter these effects.The minister shared that the astronaut-designate will also carry out experiments on the revival, survival, and reproduction of extremophiles such as Tardigrades. These micro-organisms, known for their resilience in extreme conditions, will help advance scientific understanding of the sustainability of life beyond Earth.Speaking on India’s first human spaceflight mission, Gaganyaan, Singh said its trial phases are currently under way, and the mission is scheduled for early 2027. Such ventures will be game-changers for India's space ecosystem, allowing the country to become truly Atmanirbhar in the domain.

Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen’s post-divorce realities couldn’t be more different

Gisele Bündchen’s motherhood confession offers a rare, unfiltered look at life behind the camera





Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen, once one of the most iconic power couples in the world, are now living vastly different post-divorce lives. While Brady seems to be embracing a laid-back, adventure-filled chapter with his daughter Vivian, Gisele is navigating the demanding early stages of motherhood once again — and she’s not sugarcoating it.Tom Brady, who retired from the NFL in 2023, has been making the most of his time off the gridiron. Currently touring Europe, he appears to be diving into different cultures with a humorous twist. On a recent trip to the Netherlands, Brady took to Instagram with a playful confession: “American by birth, Dutch by appetite.” Sharing a photo while indulging in local cuisine, the football legend joked about his temporary shift in loyalty — at least when it comes to food.He also shared a sweet photo with Vivian on a cruise, captioned: “Cruising through life with my favorite co-pilot.” These moments reflect the essence of Brady’s post-retirement priority: quality time with his children. Erin Andrews, Fox Sports anchor and longtime NFL reporter, echoed that sentiment: “Tom always said he wanted to spend more time with his kids once he stepped away from football. He’s really living that now.While Brady travels through Europe, Gisele is living a different reality — one marked by night feeds, exhaustion, and the emotional toll of caring for a newborn. In a candid interview with HOLA! USA and during a photoshoot with Vogue France, the Brazilian supermodel opened up about the difficult balancing act of motherhood and career.“Getting my hair and makeup done feels like I’m on vacation,” she admitted. “With a baby, the nights are so short that I’ve barely brushed my hair in the last few months!” These raw insights struck a chord with many, including parenting expert Dr. Shefali Tsabary, who said, “When someone like Gisele opens up about the physical and emotional toll of parenting a newborn, it humanizes the experience for mothers everywhere. ”Fashion designer Stella McCartney also praised Gisele’s vulnerability, saying, “Motherhood is messy and beautiful—and she’s embracing both.”Also Read: Did Tom Brady regret letting iShowSpeed near his daughter?

Kirk Cousins presents a longer-term, yet expensive, solution for Pittsburgh

Aaron Rodgers could be a short-term fix with less financial risk





As the Pittsburgh Steelers continue to face uncertainty under center, a new twist in the quarterback carousel has analysts and fans buzzing. With Russell Wilson and Justin Fields no longer seen as long-term options, attention is now zeroing in on two aging but high-profile quarterbacks: Kirk Cousins and Aaron Rodgers.On ESPN’s Get Up, analysts Bart Scott, Mike Tannenbaum, and Peter Schrager debated who would be the better fit for the Steelers—and their perspectives couldn’t be more divided.Cousins, who inked a massive $180 million deal with the Falcons last offseason, has become a financial headache for Atlanta after being benched midseason. He’s missed OTAs, and his hefty contract may be too much for the Falcons to carry.Bart Scott believes Cousins may provide stability, saying, “Kirk Cousins offers you multiple years of a solution, but with his injury history and also his salary demands, what kind of deal does that mean going forward?” Scott also pointed to Pittsburgh’s lingering QB void after Kenny Pickett didn’t pan out: “The reason why there’s an opening there is Kenny Pickett was a bust… I believe so.”Mike Tannenbaum, former Jets GM, agreed—especially if Pittsburgh can negotiate down Cousins’ salary: “I’d much rather have Kirk Cousins than Aaron Rodgers.”Rodgers, meanwhile, is still undecided about playing in 2025 after missing most of last season with an Achilles injury. Scott acknowledged Rodgers’ potential value, saying, “I don’t think he’s a better play. I think Aaron Rodgers had a sneaky solid season coming back from the Achilles.”But he argued that Cousins offers more continuity for the team.Peter Schrager pushed back, calling a Cousins trade a “panic move”: “They could have traded for Kirk Cousins in March… To me, this seems like a desperate move.”Scott flipped the desperation narrative, saying it’s Atlanta that needs to act: “Desperate for who? Because last I checked the Atlanta Falcons were $13 million over the salary cap.”Also Read: Aaron Rodgers leaves Steelers hanging as potential signing remains shrouded in silence and speculation In the end, Pittsburgh's quarterback drama remains unresolved as the franchise waits for Rodgers to decide—and possibly eyes Cousins as a strategic backup plan. Either way, it’s clear the Steelers’ 2025 season hinges on solving this puzzle.","Pittsburgh steelers' quarterback situation remains uncertain.

'H1-B scam decoded': X post slams Costco for their bias for foreign labor,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/h1-b-scam-decoded-x-post-slams-costco-for-their-bias-for-foreign-labor/articleshow/121601035.cms,"A post on X slammed Costco for its obvious bias for H-1B workers.





A job posting for Costco, the retail chain, has gone viral as social media users pointed that US companies are now not even hiding that they want H-1Bs over Americans, as that is cheaper for them. ""If hired, you will be required to provide proof of authorization to work in the United States. In some cases, applicants and employees for selected positions will not be sponsored for work authorization, including, but not limited to H1-B visas,"" the job posting said.A social media user decoded the post and said it clearly wants foreign workers who already have work authorization like a green card which allows the company to avoid visa sponsorship costs. But the company is pretending that Americans can also apply, conforming to the corporate America's playbook that they posted jobs publicly, rejected Americans by offering 30 per cent below market rate to import cheap labor.The post comes as US tech workers are crying foul over job losses that they claim are going to Indians and Chinese. The H-1B visa program allows US companies to hire foreign labor at a cheaper price.President Donald Trump earlier said he was not against the H-1B visa program as many H-1Bs work at Mar-a-Lago. But MAGA activists have been pushing the administration to stop importing foreign labors while the administration is already cracking down on foreign students, illegal immigrants.The USCIS revealed that 120, 141 H-1B visa applications have been selected for 2026. This is the lowest number since 2021 but MAGA supporters are campaigning for H-1B to be completely removed.""Another greedy company @Costco want Amercian Money and profits but do not want Americans to work for them in corporate. They want slave wages and those who will break all morality clauses and guidelines for the master of their money and employment in America,"" one wrote, replying to the Costco post.","A job posting for costco, the retail chain, has gone viral as social media users pointed that us companies are now not even hiding that they want h-1bs over americans.

What to expect at WWDC 2025

Swift Assist Updates – Enhancements to Apple’s developer tools.

Rich Text Editor for SwiftUI – A new feature aimed at improving app development workflows.

On-Device AI Models for Developers – Apple may allow third-party developers to embed its AI models into apps, though these models are smaller and less powerful than OpenAI’s or Google’s offerings.

Apple is all set to host its annual developer conference — WWDC 2025 next week. At the event the company is expected to unveil the latest versions of its iOS, iPadOS and macOS operating systems. Now a new report suggests that Apple may name the upcoming version of macOS as macOS Tahoe . As reported by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple’s upcoming macOS 26 is said to be named macOS Tahoe. The name follows Apple’s tradition of using California landmarks for macOS branding, with Lake Tahoe chosen to represent the new design overhaul expected in this release.Apple traditionally names its macOS operating systems after iconic California landmarks, a practice that has led to names like macOS Ventura, Monterey, Big Sur, and Catalina in recent years. Lake Tahoe, known for its clear waters and mountain reflections, aligns with Apple’s rumoured glass-like, translucent UI redesign. The update is expected to bring more fluid animations, redesigned icons, and a refreshed interface across Apple’s ecosystem.
