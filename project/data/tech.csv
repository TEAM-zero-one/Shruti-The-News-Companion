"Niti withdraws paper on GM crops import from US, signals govt stand",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/niti-withdraws-paper-on-gm-crops-import-from-us-signals-govt-stand/articleshow/123196591.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Niti Aayog's recent withdrawal of its working paper, which had suggested opening up import of genetically modified (GM) soybean and corn from the US, has given a peek into India's red-line on transgenic food items.Though the US, during its trade negotiations with India, considered the stand as one of the non-tariff trade barriers, India preferred not to open up its market for GM food items over biosafety concerns, notwithstanding its primary think tank arguing in favour of import of transgenic soybean and corn without harming domestic production.The working paper on 'promoting India-US agricultural trade under the new US trade regime', released in May, had suggested that GM corn may be imported for ethanol blending and its by-products, like Distiller's Dried Grains with Solubles. ""US corn is cheaper and can be used to meet India's biofuel targets without disrupting local food and feed markets,"" said the authors - Raka Saxena and Ramesh Chand - of the working paper. Chand is member, Niti Aayog, while Saxena is senior adviser at the think tank.Although the paper used a disclaimer terming the content as personal views of authors, its recent withdrawal from the think tank's website reflects govt's thinking on the issue of GM products.India currently allows commercial cultivation of only transgenic cotton, a non-food farm item.Govt's stand is in sync with RSS-affiliate Swadeshi Jagaran Manch's opposition to the cultivation and import of GM farm products. In its opposition to transgenic food items, the SJM has even joined hands with several left-leaning farm groups in the past.The working paper had pitched for a ""dual-track"" approach while negotiating the trade deal on agricultural items with the US and appeared keen on opening the country's market to specific non-sensitive imports of farm products that do not face direct competition from local producers, such as almonds, pistachios, and walnuts.India has maintained a surplus in agriculture trade with the US and it has increased over time. India's agricultural exports to the US grew nearly fivefold between 2004 and 2024, from $1.18 billion to $5.75 billion, while imports however, grew faster - from $291 million in 2004 to $2,218 million in 2024.","Niti aayog's recent withdrawal of its working paper has given a peek into india's red-line on transgenic food items.

No approvals needed for MSMEs up to Rs 125 Cr: Kejriwal

From ‘exploitative’ past to participatory governance

Industrial bodies asked to submit draft policies by October 2

NEW DELHI: AAP national convener Arvind Kejriwal and Punjab chief minister Bhagwant Mann on Friday launched 24 sectoral committees aimed at transforming Punjab’s industrial governance model. The committees will be responsible for drafting policies for each sector, shifting decision-making power from the bureaucracy to business owners, both large and small.“Policies will now be made by small and large business owners themselves; the government will implement them,” Kejriwal said at the launch event in Chandigarh. “True politics of AAP is handing power back to the people — it’s about participation, not control.”Each committee will include MSME representatives, larger businesses, and officials from the Punjab Bureau of Industrial Investment and District Industry Centres. According to CM Bhagwant Mann, the idea was proposed during government-industry consultations held in September 2023.Kejriwal highlighted new measures to ease regulatory hurdles for industries in the state. “Now, deemed approvals are being granted in 45 days in Punjab, and investments up to Rs 125 crore by MSMEs need no approval at all,” he said.He claimed that this model represented a break from previous regimes.“Earlier, the system in Punjab punished entrepreneurs for their growth — they were threatened and extorted,” he added.Describing the transition in phases, Kejriwal said, “Before 2022 – A corrupt, exploitative system inherited by AAP. 2022–2025 – The reform phase under an honest government. Now – A revolutionary model of governance led by industry.”“We don’t know how to run a textile unit or manufacture sports equipment. Nor do the officers. But still, politicians take all decisions, and people run around us,” he said. “That system is now gone.”Kejriwal urged industry stakeholders not to focus on subsidies. “Subsidies aren’t sustainable. If profit depends on them, the day subsidies stop, so does profit,” he said, calling for innovation and ease of doing business instead.The sectoral committees are expected to study national and international policies and submit their sector-specific drafts by October 2. “Make Punjab the most attractive state for investment in each sector. This is a new governance model — the government is stepping back to let people lead,” Kejriwal said.Mann echoed the sentiment, stating that the AAP government was committed to reversing Punjab’s economic decline. “Previous governments looted Punjab, but the AAP government will realize the dream of making Punjab vibrant again,” he said.Kejriwal, responding to criticism around delayed approvals, added: “Some say if you delay approvals, people will come back with bribes, and that’s how party funds are raised. But we don’t want that. Our only goal is Punjab’s development.”","Arvind kejriwal and punjab chief minister bhagwant mann launch 24 sectoral committees aimed at transforming punjab’s industrial governance model.

Elon Musk’s xAI has introduced Grok Imagine , a powerful new feature in its Grok AI platform that allows users to generate images and short video clips from simple text prompts. What’s making headlines, however, is its controversial “Spicy Mode” — a setting that reportedly enables the creation of NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content, sparking concerns about potential misuse, content moderation, and digital safety.This bold move places xAI in direct competition with major players, intensifying the race to dominate the multimedia generative AI space. As AI tools rapidly evolve from text to rich visual and video generation, Grok Imagine signals not just innovation, but a growing debate over the boundaries of creativity, ethics, digital consent, and AI responsibility.Grok Imagine is a generative AI tool that transforms text prompts into images and further enhances them into video clips with sound. By integrating multi-modal AI capabilities into a single user-friendly interface, Grok Imagine streamlines the creative process for users looking to produce custom visuals — from standard artwork to more experimental outputs.This mirrors recent industry developments like Midjourney’s new video-generation feature, showing that AI content generation is expanding rapidly beyond static imagery.The app generates a short video with audio.Grok Imagine is currently accessible through the Grok iOS app for Heavy and Premium+ subscribers, and for Heavy tier users on Android. The rollout aligns with xAI’s strategy to reserve advanced features for paid tiers, mirroring the premium access model used by other generative platforms.One of the most talked-about additions to Grok Imagine is its “Spicy Mode”, which, according to a report by TechCrunch, enables users to generate content that includes partial nudity and sexually suggestive visuals.Despite this, the app enforces content moderation. Users trying to push boundaries often receive blurred or blocked results. However, some semi-nude imagery has reportedly been generated during tests — raising questions about ethical AI boundaries and content safety.Grok Imagine competes directly with top AI tools like:Each platform has its strengths, but Grok Imagine’s inclusion of voice mode, video synthesis, and “Spicy Mode” sets it apart in terms of versatility and boldness.With Grok Imagine, xAI has added another innovative tool to the fast-growing AI ecosystem. The introduction of video generation from text, voice inputs, and visual prompts, combined with the controversial “Spicy Mode,” reflects a larger trend of merging entertainment, creativity, and technology in uncharted ways.Yet, the inclusion of NSFW capabilities — even with moderation — brings ethical and legal considerations into play, especially around AI-generated adult content.","Elon musk’s xai launches ‘grok imagine’ with nsfw mode. ‘spicy mode’ reportedly enables the creation of nsfw (not safe for work) content, sparking concerns about potential misuse, content moderation, and digital safety.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123166551,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-11122,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Newlyweds Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez were recently spotted hosting Leonardo DiCaprio and his model girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti aboard their $485 million superyacht Koru . The high-profile outing took place off the coast of Ibiza, a popular celebrity hotspot and luxury summer getaway destination. Leonardo DiCaprio, known for his understated style, wore a plain white T-shirt, shorts, and his trademark baseball cap and sunglasses. Vittoria Ceretti showcased her model figure in a strapless blue top and black yoga pants. Bezos opted for tropical-printed swim trunks paired with a navy T-shirt, while Sánchez layered a printed kimono over a bikini. Their casual vacation looks perfectly captured the relaxed yet exclusive atmosphere aboard one of the world’s most extravagant and expensive private yachts, making headlines among luxury lifestyle and celebrity news followers worldwide.Bezos’s superyacht Koru, meaning “new beginnings” in Māori, represents the couple’s extravagant lifestyle and new chapter together. Built by Dutch shipbuilder Oceanco, Koru stands as the world’s tallest sailing yacht, measuring 250 feet tall with three masts exceeding 230 feet each.At 416 feet wide, the yacht features three luxury decks, multiple lounges, and ultra-modern amenities. Its construction spanned five years, costing an estimated $485 million. The yacht previously sparked controversy when plans to dismantle a historic Rotterdam bridge emerged to allow Koru’s passage, leading to widespread public protests and alternative solutions by the builders.Leonardo DiCaprio’s attendance at Bezos and Sánchez’s Venetian wedding drew backlash, with critics calling him a “hypocrite” due to his outspoken environmental activism. Social media users highlighted the contradiction between DiCaprio’s climate advocacy and the carbon-heavy nature of celebrity private jet travel, pointing out that over 90 jets reportedly flew into Venice for the wedding.Despite the criticism, DiCaprio’s friendship with Bezos remains strong, as evidenced by their repeat vacations together including last year’s luxury yacht trip in Sardinia. One of the wedding’s most surprising attendees was Sydney Sweeney, who reportedly had no close personal connection to Bezos or Sánchez. Later reports revealed that Bezos and Sánchez are investing in Sweeney’s upcoming lingerie line, explaining her presence at the event. This move demonstrates how the Bezos-Sánchez social circle extends beyond personal relationships to professional collaborations, further solidifying their influence in both business and Hollywood circles.The Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases a blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances. Whether it’s a $40 million Venetian wedding, a $485 million yacht, or investments in rising Hollywood talent, the couple has firmly positioned themselves at the center of celebrity culture and high society.Just weeks before their Ibiza yacht trip, Bezos and Sánchez tied the knot in an opulent $40 million wedding in Venice. The three-day celebration attracted global headlines not just for its extravagance but also for the massive celebrity turnout, including Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom, and Sydney Sweeney.Despite public protests in Venice over the event’s scale, insiders revealed that the wedding was surprisingly intimate. No non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) were required for guests, allowing attendees to freely share their experiences. The bride’s $5 million diamond ring became a symbol of the wedding’s lavishness and continues to be a topic of discussion among jewelers and fans alike.","Jeff bezos and lauren sánchez hosted leonardo dicaprio and his model girlfriend vittoria ceretti aboard their $485 million superyacht koru.

Matt Deitke’s rise and how Mark Zuckerberg stepped in with a historic offer

Building Molmo and earning global recognition at the Allen Institute for AI



Vercept and Deitke’s vision for autonomous AI agents





In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, few names have made waves quite like Matt Deitke. At just 24, Deitke turned heads by rejecting a $125 million offer from Meta to join its elite AI division. What followed was even more astonishing: Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg personally met with him and doubled the offer to an eye-popping $250 million. Deitke’s decision to finally accept showcases the extraordinary lengths Big Tech is now going to in order to secure top AI talent. But who is Matt Deitke, and why is he considered one of the brightest minds in artificial intelligence today?Matt Deitke began his academic career in a PhD programme in computer science at the University of Washington. Despite his early academic promise, he left the programme to pursue more hands-on work in artificial intelligence. This move surprised many but proved instrumental in shaping his career. Deitke joined the Allen Institute for AI (AI2) in Seattle, where he quickly made a name for himself.At AI2, Deitke led the development of Molmo, a state-of-the-art multimodal chatbot capable of understanding and reasoning through a combination of text, images, and audio.His groundbreaking work earned him an Outstanding Paper Award at NeurIPS 2022, one of the most prestigious AI conferences in the world. With his rising reputation, it was not long before top tech companies began to notice.In 2024, Meta approached Deitke with a $125 million compensation package spread over four years to join its Superintelligence Lab. Surprisingly, he declined the offer, choosing to stay focused on independent research and his entrepreneurial ventures. Deitke reportedly felt that joining too early would limit his freedom to experiment—a value he deeply prioritizes in his research philosophy. Refusing to give up, Mark Zuckerberg personally met with Deitke to discuss Meta’s vision for the future of AI. Following their conversation, the offer was doubled to approximately $250 million, with up to $100 million front-loaded in the first year. It was one of the most generous recruitment packages in AI history. This time, Deitke accepted. The story of Deitke’s recruitment has since become symbolic of the escalating talent wars within the AI sector. Zuckerberg’s direct involvement also underscores how central AI has become to Meta’s long-term strategy.Before joining Meta, Deitke had already made significant contributions to AI research. At the Allen Institute for AI, he helped pioneer work on Molmo (Multimodal Language Model), a system designed to move beyond traditional text-based interaction by integrating visual and auditory data. Unlike chatbots that rely solely on language models, Molmo could respond with images, reason through spatial information, and interpret sensory input in real time. His work on Molmo was widely praised across the AI community. It was seen as a major leap toward more human-like machine interaction.Deitke’s work positioned him at the forefront of the next generation of AI tools—intelligent systems that combine perception and reasoning. His NeurIPS 2022 paper, which won an Outstanding Paper Award, drew attention for its bold approach to human-like AI reasoning. Molmo was even cited by OpenAI researchers as a benchmark system for cross-modal alignment testing, a rare recognition from rivals in the space. His contributions helped advance embodied and multimodal AI platforms that continue to support reproducible research and shared benchmarks. The achievement made Deitke not just a standout engineer but a thought leader in the AI space, someone capable of redefining how humans and machines interact.In late 2023, while still outside the Big Tech ecosystem, Deitke co-founded Vercept, a startup aimed at building AI agents that can autonomously perform complex tasks on the internet. Unlike conventional AI tools that rely on human prompts, Vercept’s agents are designed to understand goals, search the web, execute sequences of tasks, and adapt to new contexts. They essentially act like intelligent assistants with real-world functionality.Vercept began with just 10 employees but quickly attracted the attention of major investors. The company secured $16.5 million in early-stage funding, with notable backing from former Google CEO Eric Schmidt. Its early prototypes demonstrated impressive capabilities in task automation, sparking interest from enterprise clients and researchers alike. The vision behind Vercept was simple but powerful: to create AI agents that don’t just talk, but act.Matt Deitke’s work at Vercept, combined with his academic and research accomplishments, painted a clear picture of his potential. As Big Tech continues its billion-dollar race to dominate AI, it is clear why Meta was willing to go to such extraordinary lengths to bring Deitke into the fold.","Matt deitke is considered one of the brightest minds in artificial intelligence today.

"China push: In Nepal, EVs now account for 76% of all vehicles sold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/china-push-in-nepal-evs-now-account-for-76-of-all-vehicles-sold/articleshow/122960428.cms,"



KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Ev market share in nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including norway, singapore and ethiopia.

What are EV chargers and what makes them “fast”?

AC chargers (Level 1 & 2) supply alternating current which is converted within the vehicle’s onboard charger before entering the battery, these are slower and typically used at homes or offices.





DC fast chargers bypass the vehicle’s converter and feed direct current straight to the battery—offering power outputs ranging from 50 kW to over 350 kW and enabling rapid charging.





Level 1 (trickle charging): Adds about 2–5 miles of range per hour.





Level 2: Delivers 10–30 miles of range per hour, suitable for overnight residential charging.





Level 3 (DC fast charging): Adds 20–60+ miles in just 15–30 minutes; ultra-fast chargers can deliver over 150 kW for even quicker fill-ups.









Why this expansion is important for Qatar

Supporting National Vision 2030

Enhancing Convenience and Reliability

Smart Infrastructure and User Engagement





Broader context: EV charging explained

EVSE devices support various connector standards: CCS (Combined Charging System), CHAdeMO, Type 2, and Tesla’s proprietary plugs, which differ regionally.





Smart chargers can optimise grid load, schedule charging during lower-tariff hours, and monitor performance, all of which are essential for modern EV networks).





The global EV charging landscape still navigates challenges like standardizing connectors and ensuring equitable access—a concern highlighted by users in Qatar living in apartments where charging access remains sparse.









Future outlook for Qatar’s EV ecosystem

Continued rollout of fast chargers in high-density and public zones to keep pace with rising EV adoption.





Broader integration of smart payment and scheduling tools, possibly incorporating Plug & Charge features like ISO 15118 for automatic billing and authentication.





Strategic planning to avoid grid strain as ultra-fast chargers proliferate, balancing speed and sustainability goals.
