Paywall: UPI outage hits users across the country,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/paywall-upi-outage-hits-users-across-the-country/articleshow/120241983.cms,"(With inputs from our state bureau)

MUMBAI: India experienced the flip side of going cashless when Unified Payments Interface (UPI), the platform that accounts for more than four-fifths of all digital transactions in the country, suffered a major outage Saturday, leaving users struggling to make payments across malls, parking lots and shops.Users across India reported failed payments. Some got debit alerts despite failed transactions. National Payments Corporation of India, which operates UPI, reported ""intermittent technical issues leading to partial transaction declines"" which ""stabilised by late afternoon"". TNNNPCI said they regretted the outage and were ""working to resolve the issue"". The impact was pan-India, with complaints from people in Bengal, Delhi, Maharashtra, UP, Gujarat, Uttarakhand, Assam and the southern states. A woman in the national capital said the outage inconvenienced people at a specialty hospital as it led to a long queue at the payments desk. In Lucknow, Ahad Arshad, operator of the popular food chain Red Dragon, said around 50 customers were unable to pay their bills. ""We had to note down their contact numbers for payment later. It was chaotic for about 25 minutes but eventually all dues were cleared,"" he said.Payment providers said they started facing increased failures just before 10am. There was no shutdown of services but a sharp rise in failed transactions. Success rates improved later in the afternoon. NPCI did not give any details of the cause of the failures nor about the increase in failure rate.Sources said that it was not a capacity issue as NPCI was used to higher volumes. The corporation was doing a ""root cause analysis"" and did not disclose the reasons behind the disruption.An Ahmedabad-based petrol pump owner, requesting anonymity, said they switched to precautionary payment methods during the disruption. ""We took UPI payments before filling fuel or requested customers to use other options."" In UP, from restaurants to retailers, users across the state reported that popular third-party payment platforms like Google Pay, PhonePe and Paytm were unresponsive between 11.20am and 11.45am.The disruption was the fourth in 30 days - an unusual frequency for a platform that has a highly reliable track record. Since its launch in 2016, UPI has scaled rapidly without major hiccups. Its ease of use - allowing peer-to-peer transfers at no cost - has made it ubiquitous, from roadside vendors to high-value transactions of up to Rs 1 lakh. Many consumers, now accustomed to its dependability, no longer carry cash.For small merchants, the outage meant missed sales. Larger retailerssaw customers switch to more expensive card-based payments, raising transaction costs.The impact ranged from a few rupees in rickshaw fares to larger purchases at petrol stations and shops. Earlier, disruptions on March 26 were also attributed to a technical issue. Banks said the outages on March 31 and April 2 were largely due to heavy traffic at the close of the financial year.The last time UPI faced a systemic vulnerability was in 2020 when Yes Bank, then a key service provider for apps such as PhonePe, was placed under a moratorium by RBI. The fallout led NPCI to propose market-share caps to mitigate single-point-of-failure risks. Despite these efforts, Google Pay and PhonePe continue to dominate the UPI ecosystem. Though transactions feel instantaneous to users, the process involves nearly 10 rapid-fire digital handshakes among third-party apps, their banks, customers and recipient banks, and recipient payment processors and their banks.","Users across india reported failed payments. National payments corporation of india, which operates upi, reported ""intermittent technical issues leading to partial transaction declines"" the impact was pan-india, with complaints from people in bengal, delhi, maharashtra, up, gujarat, uttarakhand, assam.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120242069,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-20908,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Kayla Nicole’s journey from being judged to being empowered

Welcome to The Pre-Game

Kayla Nicole has been candid about her emotional journey post-breakup with Travis Kelce , shedding light on how not just he but other past partners treated her harshly. In the debut episode of her new podcast The Pre-Game, Kayla reflected on how dating high-profile men led to toxic dynamics and emotional pain, ultimately pushing her to change how she approaches love and relationships.Kayle Nicole admitted that the experience of dating someone in the public eye came with a price constant scrutiny, unsolicited opinions, and being dragged into media storms she never asked for. After her split from Kelce in 2022, the situation escalated when Travis Kelce began dating Taylor Swift. The online harassment Kayla faced intensified, with people comparing her to Swift, questioning her worth, and making cruel comments. She confessed that this hate still affects her to this day, despite having done nothing to deserve it.Kayla Nicole, who once interned at TMZ and the Oprah Winfrey Network before launching her own media brand, is now opening up on her podcast The Pre-Game about the struggles behind her success. In a recent episode, she recalled a college relationship with a then-NBA hopeful a man she supported, only to have him dim her own ambitions in return. It was a painful chapter that shaped her resilience and drive.""It's not that simple. It's not going to happen,"" she explained.Kayla Nicole shared that these experiences left her feeling broken and deeply self-conscious, saying she spent a long time trying to heal. She was often forced to explain herself or stay silent while the world judged her unfairly. It made her realize that even though her past relationships brought temporary highs, the emotional toll was far too great.In a heartfelt moment, Kayla Nicole said, ""I’ve been harshly treated by more than one man. Travis wasn’t only one. But the aftermath of that relationship taught me to put myself first.""Now, she’s taking a different path, one that prioritizes privacy, peace, and emotional safety. Kayla Nicole stated she’s no longer interested in making her romantic life public, joking that she's now “dating and hiding.” She won’t reveal who she’s with unless she’s married and has a family. For Kayla, this boundary isn't about secrecy, it's about protection.Kayla Nicole's story is resonating with many who’ve faced similar situations, and she’s using her voice to advocate for healing, setting boundaries, and choosing self-love over public validations.Also Read: Kayla Nicole and the ‘gold digger’ myth: Debunking outdated stereotypes about women dating athletes","Kayla nicole has been candid about her emotional journey post-breakup with travis kelce.

This step-by-step guide will walk you through the process, including the best prompts to achieve that iconic Barbie aesthetic -- think vibrant colors, glamorous outfits, and a polished, doll-like vibe.AI Barbie trend involves social media users uploading a photo of themselves to ChatGPT, which then designs a packaged Barbie doll based on their appearance. Users also request the bot to add personal touches, like coffee mugs or pets, reflecting items from their daily lives. The outcome is a strikingly realistic custom Barbie doll that seems ready for purchase.Choose a clear, well-lit image of yourself, a friend, or even a pet you want to transform.Use ChatGPT to refine promptsTools like DALL·E, Midjourney, or Stable Diffusion to create the final image.Select a high-quality photo with good lighting and a visible subject (face or full body works best). The clearer the image, the easier it is for AI tools to interpret details. If you’re uploading the photo to an AI tool, ensure it’s in a common format like JPEG or PNG.ChatGPT can help you write detailed, specific prompts for image generators. Describe your goal: Turning your photo into a Barbie-style doll. Here’s how to interact with ChatGPT:Example Input to ChatGPT: “I want to turn a photo of a person into a Barbie-style doll using an AI image generator. Can you help me create a detailed prompt that captures the Barbie aesthetic—glossy hair, vibrant outfits, and a plastic-like doll finish?”Below are some ready-to-use prompts optimized for AI image generators. Adjust them based on your photo’s subject (e.g., swap “woman” for “man” or “pet” if needed).“A hyper-realistic Barbie doll based on a [describe subject, e.g., young woman with long brown hair], with smooth, glossy skin, large sparkling eyes, and a bright smile. She wears a vibrant pink ball gown with glittery accents, high heels, and a tiara. Her hair is styled in voluminous waves, with a plastic-like sheen. The background is a dreamy pastel pink studio with soft lighting, giving a toy-box aesthetic. Ultra-detailed, 4K resolution.”“A Barbie-style doll version of [describe subject, e.g., a person with short blonde hair], with flawless, porcelain-like skin and bold makeup (pink lipstick, dramatic eyelashes). Dressed in a trendy, colorful jumpsuit with statement jewelry and stiletto boots. The pose is confident, hands on hips, with a glossy, plastic-like texture. Set against a chic city skyline backdrop at sunset, vibrant and polished, cinematic lighting, 8K quality.”“A magical Barbie doll inspired by [describe subject, e.g., a woman with curly red hair], with an ethereal glow, sparkling blue eyes, and a doll-like finish. She wears a flowing, iridescent mermaid-style dress with gemstone details and a crown. Her hair cascades in shiny, toy-like curls. The background is a whimsical fantasy forest with glowing flowers, rendered in a vibrant, hyper-detailed style, 4K resolution.”“A cute Barbie-style doll version of [describe pet, e.g., a fluffy white dog], transformed into an anthropomorphic toy with big, shiny eyes and a plastic-like sheen. Dressed in a tiny pink tutu and bow, with a sparkly collar. The pose is playful, standing upright like a doll. Background is a colorful toy store shelf with pastel props, ultra-realistic, 4K quality.”Pro Tip: Add “inspired by a photo of [subject]” to the prompt if the AI tool allows photo uploads for reference. For example, “A Barbie doll inspired by a photo of a woman with long black hair…”Sign into your chosen AI image tool (e.g., Midjourney via Discord, Stable Diffusion’s web interface, or DALL·E through OpenAI’s platform). Follow these steps:Some tools allow you to upload a reference image. Check the tool’s guidelines for how to integrate it.Copy your ChatGPT-crafted or provided prompt into the text field.Set the resolution to high (e.g., 4K or 8K if available) and choose a style like “hyper-realistic” or “cinematic” for that polished Barbie look.Run the prompt and wait for the output. It may take a few seconds to minutes.For extra polish, you can use editing software to enhance your Barbie doll images. Apply a slight blur or airbrush effect for that plastic-doll finish. You can use Canva or Photoshop to add glittery effects to outfits or backgrounds.","Chatgpt can help you write detailed, specific prompts for image generators.

Verdict

The Galaxy S series phones have always been the best of what Samsung has to offer in the bar form factor and while the lineup includes three models - the vanilla, the Plus and the Ultra, the Plus has always been the one doing the balancing act between the two. The tale is no different this time around. Galaxy S25 Plus – the middle man of the Galaxy S25 series still carries that weight targeting a specific segment who want a bigger phone but without that extra cost or added bells and whistles of Galaxy S25 Ultra.The Rs 99,990 starting price tag --well– is a bit more than the Galaxy S24+. But it now has a bigger role to play in the series too.For instance, it packs all the Galaxy AI features, comes with the same – Snapdragon 8 Elite for Galaxy – chip as the Ultra and even has a good camera setup.The idea here is to prioritise function over fiction. The question to be asked is: Can Galaxy S25+ live up to that expectation? Or, it falls short and leaves a little too much room for improvement.We have been testing the phone over the past few weeks and this is what we think about it. Samsung Galaxy S25+ retains the familiar design language of its predecessor, the S24+, with subtle refinements that enhance its premium appeal. The flat back, floating camera lenses, and aluminum frame exude sophistication, while the addition of thicker rings around the camera lenses adds a bold aesthetic touch. Same as its predecessor, the Samsung Galaxy S25+ also comes with IP68 rating which makes the smartphone resistant to dust and water. Available in s colours like Navy, Icy Blue, Silver Shadow, and Icy Mint, the device stands out, especially in the Navy Blue variant. The slim form factor makes it comfortable to hold, though it can feel slippery, necessitating a protective case.The front of the smartphone is dominated by a 6.7-inch QHD+ AMOLED display which is protected with a layer of Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2 on top. The screen is surrounded by thin bezels on all sides and the 12MP selfie camera is placed in the centre. Despite a large display, the smartphone comes with a compact form factor and it is easy to hold and use with one hand.The smartphone's rear panel boasts a sleek, frosty finish that resists fingerprints, ensuring a clean and polished look. The Samsung branding is subtly positioned near the bottom, while the triple rear camera setup is neatly aligned vertically in the top-left corner. The power button and volume rockers are placed on the right side while the bottom part houses the USB Type C charging port and the SIM card tray. The Samsung Galaxy S25+ boasts a sleek and minimalistic design, perfect for those who appreciate simplicity while still making a bold impression.Samsung Galaxy S25+ houses a 6.7-inch QHD+ display with 1440x3120 pixel resolution. The Infinity-O display comes with adaptive refresh rate from 1 to 120Hz. The screen is made scratch-resistant with the help of the Corning Gorilla Glass Victus 2. The display is undoubtedly one of the standout features of the Samsung Galaxy S25+. Its bright and vibrant screen offers excellent visibility, even in direct sunlight, while accurately reproducing colors for a lifelike viewing experience. The variable refresh rate ensures smooth scrolling and transitions, with the option to lower it to conserve battery life. By default, the display settings provide a visually comfortable experience, but users can personalise the colour profiles to suit their individual preferences. The smartphone also allows you to select from three different screen resolutions — HD+, FHD+ and QHD+. Samsung Galaxy S25+ users have access to additional display controls, including night mode and blue light levels, which allow them to optimise and maximise their display experience. Apart from this, we also liked the Easy mode of the display which makes the text and on-screen items appear larger. It also increases touch-and-hold delay to prevent accidental actions and provides a high contrast keyboard for better readability. Also, the display's high resolution and HDR10+ support make it ideal for watching movies and videos, providing an immersive viewing experience.Powered by the Snapdragon 8 Elite chipset, the Galaxy S25+ delivers top-tier performance. The smartphone comes in two variants – 12GB RAM and 256GB internal storage and 12GB RAM and 512GB internal storage. Samsung Galaxy S25+ is designed to handle every task smoothly. Whether multitasking, gaming, or running resource-intensive applications, the device handles everything with ease. The chipset's efficiency ensures minimal heating, even during prolonged usage. The smartphone's powerful Qualcomm processor handles graphic-intensive games with ease, and the touch sampling rate of 240Hz via the Game Launcher enhances the gaming experience. Moving on to audio performance, the Samsung Galaxy S25+ excels in this area as well. While many smartphones struggle to deliver a satisfying audio experience, the S25+ stands out. Its stereo speakers provide loud and crystal-clear sound, even at higher volume levels, without any noticeable distortion. Whether using headphones or speakers, the audio quality was thoroughly enjoyable. Additionally, the smartphone impressed us with its consistent and reliable performance during calls, ensuring clear communication.Samsung Galaxy S25+ runs Android 15 operating system topped with the company's own layer of One UI 7. The company has promised that the smartphone will get seven years of OS and security patch updates.One UI 7 is the biggest update – One UI --has received since the inception. The entire design language of the user interface has changed. While it is still unmistakably Samsung with clean and futuristic design, there are design changes that makes it one of the best Android interfaces out there.One more thing to note is that Samsung has designed it keeping the AI integration in mind and that can be seen with the deep integration Galaxy AI has thought the interface. We will get to that later.Before that, the interface is clean, customisable, and packed with features that enhance usability. The inclusion of features like split-screen multitasking and enhanced privacy controls further elevates the software experience. With One UI 7, the Samsung has divided the notification and quick toggles into two distinct planes. You can access the notification panel by swiping down from the top left corner of the screen, while the expanded quick toggles panel is accessible by swiping down from the top right corner. All the Google suite apps come pre-installed on the smartphone along with some Samsung apps which include Gallery, My Files, Internet, Health, Calculator, Calendar, Wallet and more. Powered by Google Gemini, the device offers a versatile AI experience. Users can engage in extensive conversations, generate creative ideas, such as recipes from fridge contents or artistic concepts, and even create images.We really liked the AI Summarise feature on the Samsung Galaxy S25+ which is designed to enhance productivity and efficiency. This feature allows users to generate concise summaries of various types of content, such as documents, articles, or even videos, directly on their device. By leveraging advanced natural language processing, the AI can extract key points and present them in an easy-to-digest format, saving users time and effort.Another interesting feature of Samsung Galaxy S25+ is the Cross-app Action feature which simplifies multitasking by enabling seamless interactions across multiple apps. For example, you can perform complex tasks like searching for a restaurant and sharing its location with a friend in one step, without manually switching between apps. By simply using voice commands, such as ""Find a restaurant on some street and send it to your friends and family,"" the feature handles the entire process efficiently.The Galaxy Generative Edit is another useful feature of Samsung Galaxy S25+. The tool is designed to enhance photo editing capabilities. This feature allows users to move or delete objects within their photos seamlessly. Once an object is removed or repositioned, the AI intelligently fills in the background, ensuring a natural and cohesive look. To use this feature, users can simply outline the object they wish to edit using their finger. They can then drag the object to a new location or remove it entirely. The AI processes the changes and generates a refined image with the adjustments applied. This tool is particularly useful for removing unwanted elements or distractions from photos, making it easier to create polished and professional-looking images directly on the device.To read more about the AI features you can click here. These AI enhancements not only improve usability but also set the S25+ apart from its competitors.Samsung Galaxy S25+ features a triple rear camera setup which consists of 50MP main camera with LED flash, 12MP 120° Ultra Wide sensor and 10MP Telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom. The front is home to a 12MP selfie camera. The camera system on the Galaxy S25+ is versatile and reliable. Samsung’s One UI 7 introduces a refreshed camera app interface. The mode carousel has been repositioned below the shutter button for easier access. Additionally, the Pro mode has been reworked to ensure controls remain unobtrusive.The 50MP primary sensor captures detailed and vibrant photos. The main camera captures clean and clear images with the right amount of detailing and impressive dynamic range. The Samsung Galaxy S25+ main camera also excels with rapid subject focusing, nearly flawless white balance and exposure, and delivers images with vivid colour accuracy and impressive detail. While colours may occasionally appear slightly oversaturated – and that's just Samsung's way – the camera maintains excellent image quality even in low-light settings, with minimal noise. The main camera can also capture images in 50MP resolution and you will love the results. The 10MP telephoto lens with 3x optical zoom delivers sharp images, though it feels slightly outdated compared to competitors offering higher zoom capabilities. Additionally, the telephoto lens captures images with ample detail and minimal noise, although occasional colour and sharpness inconsistencies may arise. The 12MP ultra-wide lens on the Samsung Galaxy S25+ excels in landscape and group shots. The 12MP ultra-wide-angle lens delivers precise colour reproduction, exceptional detail, and a versatile focal length, making it ideal for creative photography.The Samsung Galaxy S25+ boasts remarkable video capabilities, effortlessly recording 8K videos and FHD videos at 120fps. The footage showcases exceptional clarity, balanced exposure, and a wide dynamic range. Even in low-light conditions, the videos remain sharp, bright, and richly detailed.The Samsung Galaxy S25+ 12MP front camera delivers impressive performance, featuring autofocus and excellent overall quality. It captures sharp, vibrant selfies with accurate colors and performs well even in challenging lighting conditions, making it a reliable choice for photography enthusiasts.The Samsung Galaxy S25+ is bound to impress you with its exceptional battery performance. The smartphone is backed by a 4,900 mAh battery which comes with 45W fast charging, Qi wireless charging and Wireless PowerShare functionality. In our testing, the smartphone lasted 24 hours on a single charge with mixed usage. Battery backup can vary depending on usage patterns. For instance, avid gamers engaging in intense gaming sessions may find the battery depletes faster. The smartphone, however, compensates with robust charging options, including 45W fast charging, Qi wireless charging, and wireless PowerShare. While the device doesn't come with a charging adapter, the company asserts that it can charge from 0% to 50% in just 15 minutes.The smartphone comes with a Battery protection feature which is designed to adjust the charging behaviour to extend the battery life. The mode comes with three options — Basic (when your battery is charged 100%, charging will stop until the battery level drops to 95% and then the charging will start again), Adaptive (Stop charging at 80% while you are asleep and switch to Basic before you wake up. Sleep time is estimated based on your phone usage patterns) and Maximum (your battery will stop charging when it reaches 80%). The smartphone also comes with a power saving mode which enables users to toggle multiple settings in order to increase the battery life.Despite a slightly smaller battery capacity, the phone's performance remains dependable and unlikely to disappoint users.It's time to answer the question that we asked: Can Galaxy S25+ live up to that expectation? Or, it falls short and leaves a little too much room for improvement. In one line – it does live up to the expectations. But also falls short at places where it perhaps won't matter to users much. And, this is why the ‘Ultra’ is there.It has a functional design, reliable performance, and a practical camera setup. The battery is big enough with multiple charging options, that delivers solid battery life. AI features add to its functionality and are practical too which makes everyday tasks easier. Everything about the phone is built from a practical and functional aspect, offering a well-rounded, no-nonsense experience.Is there room for improvement – yes there are places, but most of them aren't deal breakers. And this is exactly what we discussed – the idea is to offer function over fiction and that's exactly what Galaxy S25+ is all about.","Samsung galaxy s25+ houses a 6.7-inch qhd+ display with 1440x3120 pixel resolution.

A woman in Australia gave birth to a stranger’s baby after her IVF clinic accidentally implanted the wrong embryo.Australia's IVF provider Monash IVF , attributed “human error” responsible for the accidental mix-up, as reported by the Australian media. The incident came to light in February, after the birth parents asked for their remaining embryos to be transferred to another fertility clinic.“Instead of finding the expected number of embryos, an additional embryo remained in storage for the birth parents,” the company said in a statement.The statement put out by the company said, an initial investigation was launched immediately, which confirmed an embryo from another patient had been mistakenly thawed and transferred to the birth mother, and had not uncovered any other such errors.Its statement didn’t identify the patients involved or divulge details about the child's custody. The birth parents were informed about the mistake within a week of finding it.“All of us at Monash IVF are devastated and we apologise to everyone involved,” said CEO Michael Knaap. “We will continue to support the patients through this extremely distressing time,"" he added.The incident has been reported to the relevant regulators, including the Reproductive Technology Accreditation Committee, and also voluntarily reported the incident to the new Queensland assisted reproductive technology regulator.This isn’t the first time Monash IVF has faced trouble.

What is a digital journey pass?



The International Civil Aviation Organization, the UN body responsible for global flying policies, is mulling to do away with existing rules for flyers to do check-ins, show boarding passes etc, in a major digital step-up. The Times reported that passengers will upload their passports to their phones and pass through airports using only their face for verification. The major policy overhaul will be effective within two to three years.Passengers will be able to download a digital journey pass to their phone when they book a flight. It will be automatically updated if any changes are made to the booking. There will be no check-in, and airlines will be alerted to a passenger's intention to fly when they arrive at the airport and once their face is scanned.The journey pass will contain all the booking details and biometric passport details. Passengers will not have to take their phone or passport out of their pockets as their face will open all the doors.Passengers with luggage will drop them at bag drop and those with just hand luggage will first be scanned at the pre-security gates, which permit passengers access to the airports's central search area, the report said.According to the existing rules, passengers must check-in online or at the airport after they arrive where they are issued a boarding pass with a barcode that's scanned as a passenger proceeds through the airport.But the new system would require the airports to have facial recognition technology and to read a passport from a mobile device.“These changes are the biggest in 50 years,” said Valérie Viale, director of product management at Amadeus, the world’s largest travel technology company. “Many airline systems haven’t changed for more than 50 years because everything has to be consistent across the industry and interoperable.“The last upgrade of great scale was the adoption of e-ticketing in the early 2000s. The industry has now decided it’s time to upgrade to modern systems that are more like what Amazon would use.”","Passengers will be able to download a digital journey pass to their phone.

"Doctors said he’d never move again, then Elon Musk’s brain chip changed everything",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/doctors-said-hed-never-move-again-then-elon-musks-brain-chip-changed-everything/articleshow/120236834.cms,"Noland Arbaugh (Picture credit: X)

A groundbreaking moment in neurotechnology has taken centre stage in the life of Noland Arbaugh , a 30-year-old man from Arizona, US, who became the first person to receive a brain chip implant from Elon Musk ’s Neuralink .Arbaugh, who was paralysed below the shoulders following a diving accident in 2016, received the chip in January 2024 and the results have already been nothing short of extraordinary, reported BBC.The device, a brain-computer interface (BCI), enables Arbaugh to control a computer using only his thoughts. “You just have no control, no privacy, and it's hard,” he said, recalling his early struggles with paralysis. But after the surgery, he could move a computer cursor by merely thinking about moving his fingers. “Honestly I didn’t know what to expect, it sounds so sci-fi,” BBC quoted him.Now, he can play video games and even beat his friends at chess, a feat he never imagined after his injury. “Now I'm beating my friends at games, which really shouldn't be possible, but it is”.While not the first BCI ever developed, Neuralink’s chip has attracted significant attention due to Musk’s involvement. Still, Arbaugh insists the focus should be on the science, not the celebrity. “If everything worked out, then I could help being a participant of Neuralink. If something terrible happened, I knew they would learn from it,” he said.The chip works by detecting brain signals linked to movement and translating them into digital commands. It’s part of a field that has developed over decades, but Musk’s entrance has brought heightened attention and scrutiny. Experts have hailed the procedure as a “significant milestone,” though caution remains due to the chip’s invasive nature.There have been challenges. Arbaugh temporarily lost control of the device when it partially disconnected from his brain, causing significant distress. The issue was later resolved through software adjustments.Privacy concerns also loom large. Professor Anil Seth from the University of Sussex warned that such technology could grant access to “what we think, what we believe and what we feel,” suggesting it could mark the end of personal privacy. But Arbaugh remains optimistic, hoping to one day use the chip to control a wheelchair or even a robot.Neuralink isn’t alone in this space. Competitor Synchron, for example, uses a less invasive method by implanting its device through a blood vessel. One user, identified only as Mark, can now explore the world virtually using the chip in combination with Apple’s Vision Pro headset.For Arbaugh, who joined a six-year study for the Neuralink device, the future is uncertain but full of possibility. “We know so little about the brain and this is allowing us to learn so much more,” he said.Whether for restoring movement, enabling communication, or even transforming how humans interact with machines, Arbaugh’s experience may represent only the beginning of a revolution.","Noland arbaugh, 30, was paralysed below the shoulders following a diving accident in 2016.

Pumping up production

Chinese electronics component makers are offering price reductions of up to 5% to Indian companies as part of new sourcing contract negotiations, driven by concerns over the US trade conflict. US President Donald Trump has slapped a whopping 125% tariff on Chinese goods after China announced retaliatory tariffs.The US-China trade dispute has considerably reduced new orders to Chinese manufacturers, as global supply networks adjust to reciprocal tariffs, with the US imposing the highest rate of 125% on Chinese goods. The decreased American demand for Chinese electronics will also affect component requirements.The discounts being offered by Chinese companies are a substantial concession in an industry with slim 4-7% profit margins, according to an ET report. This could potentially allow Indian manufacturers to increase their profits by 2-3%, according to television, refrigerator and smartphone producers. Indian companies might transfer some cost benefits to customers to enhance sales.Chinese imports constitute approximately 75% of all electronics components used in Indian manufacturing.""Component manufacturers in China are under pressure,"" said Kamal Nandi, head of the appliance business at Godrej Enterprises Group. ""Prices will be renegotiated as export orders from the US slow down.""The electronics sector typically maintains raw material stocks for two to three months. Companies will initiate new orders from May-June onwards. According to a recent GTRI report, India's electronics component imports in FY24 increased by 36.7% to $34.4 billion compared to the previous year. Over five years, imports grew by 118.2% from $15.8 billion in FY19.Also Read | Apple looks to manufacture more iPhones in India as Trump’s tariffs hit China harder: Report Chinese manufacturers are experiencing surplus issues, according to Avneet Singh Marwah, chief executive of television contract manufacturer Super Plastronics.""There is panic.

""However, since domestic demand in India is not robust, companies may pass some as discounts."" In 2024, electrical and electronic equipment represented the largest segment of US imports from China, amounting to $127.06 billion.Chinese suppliers are encountering reduced demand in India due to production-linked incentives, quality control orders (QCOs) requiring Bureau of Indian Standards approval for overseas sourcing, and increasing import duties on components, which have promoted local manufacturing. The India Cellular and Electronics Association projects domestic components and sub-assembly manufacturing to reach $145-155 billion by 2030, following the government's announcement of the Electronics Component Manufacturing Scheme on Tuesday.

This growth pace, driven by India’s young population, increasing use of advanced chips by businesses, and supportive government policies, is faster than the global average.The UBS report , quoted by ANI, also highlighted that localisation efforts will play a key role, contributing around $13 billion in revenues by 2030.At present, India holds just 0.1 per cent of global wafer capacity, spends about 1 per cent on semiconductor equipment annually, and accounts for 6.5 per cent of global semiconductor demand . Despite these modest figures, India is becoming a crucial end market with strong future potential.The report further pointed out that multinational companies are rethinking their supply chains due to tariff uncertainties, with some already moving final assembly operations out of China under a “China plus one” strategy.While China leads in tech manufacturing, India’s strength lies in its large pool of software and services talent. In semiconductors too, India stands out with almost 20 per cent of the world’s chip designers work in India for global firms.Although the US and China remain the biggest markets for semiconductors, India’s $54 billion demand in 2025 reflected its growing importance in the global semiconductor ecosystem.","India’s semiconductor industry is set to undergo rapid growth, with end-demand revenues expected to double from $54 billion in 2025 to $108 billion by 2030. At present, india holds just 0.1 per cent of global wafer capacity, spends about 1 per cent on semiconductor equipment annually.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120231057,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-69890,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
UPI outage in cripples transactions in UP; businesses reel under disruption,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/upi-outage-in-cripples-transactions-in-up-businesses-reel-under-disruption/articleshow/120238843.cms,"LUCKNOW: India’s most widely used digital payments platform, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI), faced its second major outage this month on Saturday, throwing business operations and personal transactions into disarray for thousands of users across Uttar Pradesh.From restaurants to retailers, users across the state reported that popular third-party payment platforms like Google Pay, PhonePe, and Paytm were unresponsive between 11.20 am and 11.45 am, triggering widespread inconvenience.In Lucknow, Ahad Arshad, operator of the popular Chinese food chain Red Dragon, said around 50 customers were unable to pay their bills. “We had to note down their contact numbers for payment later. It was chaotic for about 25 minutes but eventually all dues were cleared,” he said.The ripple effect was visible in Sitapur, where chemist and wholesaler Gopal Tandon said, “Weekends are busy for us as many pharmacists collect supplies. Since we now rely almost entirely on UPI, the glitch stalled transactions and deliveries for over half an hour.”In Sultanpur’s Amhat area, car showroom owner Mohammed Siraj told TOI that two to three bookings had to be deferred due to failed UPI transactions “Customers were frustrated and left, promising to return later,” he said.Vinod Kumar Singh, a jewellery trader in Gorakhpur, said the glitch significantly impacted his Saturday sales. “Customers who had come for purchases returned without buying anything. We lost potential high-value sales.”Kanpur-based cafe owner Radhika Srivastava said she faced a full café with customers unable to pay. “We had to keep tabs on 20 plus orders and offer alternatives like cash and cards—many left without completing transactions.”In Unnao, electronic appliance dealer Rahul Verma said three out of five customers were unable to complete their EMIs or down payments. “Even our point-of-sale machine that links with UPI failed temporarily.”The glitch, though short-lived, left a big impact, particularly on small and medium businesses that have grown dependent on real-time digital payments. Outage monitoring platforms showed a spike in complaints during the window, while social media saw users venting their frustration.The National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ), which manages UPI, late Saturday night in a post on X stated, “UPI services have been stable since late afternoon, and NPCI continues to monitor the situation closely. We regret the inconvenience caused and thank you for your patience.”","India's most widely used digital payments platform, the unified payments interface (upi), faced its second major outage this month on saturday.

"Markets in India safe, people shouldn’t panic: Sebi chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/markets-in-india-safe-people-shouldnt-panic-sebi-chairman-tuhin-kanta-pandey/articleshow/120221632.cms,"Will bring in four elements of trust, transparency, technology and teamwork under triple mandate of investment protection, development of markets and regulation of markets: Tuhin Kanta Pandey

Sebi chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey

TOI’s Surojit Gupta & Sidhartha, Pandey

What are your priority areas?

In a sense, you are promoting ease of doing business?

Markets are very volatile now. How do you assure the investor community that Indian markets are safe?

Have you increased surveillance in

the market, amid what’s happening around the globe?

What is the state of play on IPOs? Do you see some slowing down because of the volatility?

What is the progress on a common KYC across the financial sector?

What is the position on allowing foreign individuals to invest directly in Indian stock markets?

What is your view on overseas listing of Indian companies?

Does Sebi need to do more on communication with the market?

There is also a lot of misinformation. Are you planning a fact check?

Are you looking at promoting new kinds of futures such as energy futures? Agricultural futures have been a no-go area. Will you review that?

India has moved forward and

introduced a T+0 for a select number of stocks. What is the roadmap?

How much of a challenge do you think the new technology, such AI, is for capital markets?

One of the irritants for people is the IEPF (Investor Education and Protection Fund) guidelines. There are a lot of complaints that people are not able to get their genuine claims settled…

What are the other measures that the regulator is contemplating to make the market more secure for a new retrail investor?

is a little over a month into his job and has undertaken several measures to ensure more trust in the stock market regulator. In an interview totalks about a range of issues and assures investors that the Indian markets are safe against the backdrop of volatility triggered by global events. Excerpts...We have got three mandates, which are investment protection, development of markets and regulation of markets. Four elements that we will bring in are trust, transparency, technology and teamwork. On trust, it will be people’s trust in Sebi and Sebi’s trust of its ecosystem, both need to be promoted. Conflict of interest norms also need to be updated, for which we have set up a committee and that will give us a lot of guidance on how we put our framework. Another issue on trust is how we are going to make our regulations.Regulations should be optimum, which are risk-based. If you have a higher amount of risk, there should be a higher scrutiny, if there is low amount of risk or something which need not be micromanaged, in that case, we should not get into that.So that balancing is required. We also need to look at some of the past regulations. Whether in a particular context they may have been necessary, but now context may have changed, or technology has worked out, or the system has improved and therefore that kind of micromanagement may not be contextually necessary. In that case, we should eliminate them. Every department is being asked to look at their regulations and work with stakeholders to identify what are the points that can be simplified.Yes, ease of doing business combined with ensuring that market integrity is maintained at all times, and investors are duly protected. With the development of the market, there are new products, the Indian capital market is growing rapidly. It has to have all elements. It has to have different types of risks. There are different diversifications, which are already there. There are different possibilities in the futures market, such as energy futures.Our payment and settlement systems are very robust. The possibil ity of any default is not there. The contracts will be honoured. People can enter and exit without difficulty. When we are interacting with other market participants, FIIs and other investors, they have a lot of trust in our institutions, in our ability to handle. Indian systems are some of the most modern in the world, most secure in the world. From 2019 to 2024, the CAGR in India was 8.5% in dollar terms. In this period it was zero for emerging market and minus 3% for China.From the 1990s, when FIIs were allowed, the markets have consistently given double-digit returns in dollar terms. These markets have developed over a period of time. We are estimating 6.5% GDP growth and the fundamentals are strong. The budget has offered incentives, which will boost domestic consumption and RBI ’s policy has been supportive and accommodative. Headwinds are there, no doubt. But India may offer some opportunities too, relatively speaking.We are always on 24x7 surveillance. Sebi in coordination with exchanges is constantly watching the situation. And, we had, even the worst days when you had a sharp fall, we did have an impact. Relative to the rest of the world, India was much less affected.There were some concerns around some of the small IPOs seeing massive subscriptions.On the SME IPO issue, there have been changes by Sebi and certain regulatory measures have been brought in. On the main board, IPOs have gone up. India had the largest number of IPOs. In contrast, there are markets where IPOs have not been possible for the whole year.There is good progress there. Both Sebi and RBI have to work together and there are certain points that need to be ironed out, which we should be able to do soon.There is some discussion happening. The department of economic affairs is undertaking a review of Fema rules. One of them relates to NRIs and there is a limit of 5% that they are thinking of raising it to 10% and the overall to 24%. Then, there is the idea that investors could be directly asked to do that. But we still have to examine and deliberate. There is discussion on how the KYC will be done, what the implications will be and so on. Right now, individuals can come, but they have to come through FIIs or through a fund.On the contrary, there are a lot of companies that want to list in India and we should welcome that. We will facilitate it. We are here to develop our capital market. Reverse flipping is taking place.We have been communicating. We put a lot of things on the website and Sebi has very good practices. We must appreciate that they have been developed over a period of time and successive leadership in Sebi has honed up this place, they have nurtured it. The institution has come up, faced many challenges and also improved. Obviously, we have to constantly be on the move because no complacency is acceptable. One piece which was missing, we didn’t have a very active social media presence and we have recently unveiled it.We immediately get into areas where some false online platform is there and there are attempts to swindle the money in the name of investment, including through cyber frauds. Then, there is also the issue of fin-fluencers. We have taken down something like 70,000 fin-fluencers from YouTube with the help of Meta and Google. At the same time, we also want more of the industry to develop and have registered entities.We will be making progress around that (energy futures) because a lot of things have been developed and a lot of regulatory hurdles have been crossed. Soon you should be seeing that. About agriculture, some of the important products are not available. That is something which is hampering the industry. But that’s a policy call, which has to be taken by govt.If you ask me, T+1 is good enough.AI has to be looked at from both sides. It has enormous potential. For example, Sebi itself uses a lot of AI tools and going forward, we would like to use this in all areas of our work. But AI also has certain other points, which are risks. So, we also need to evolve a risk mitigation strategy.Proactive efforts should be made so that it doesn’t have to go to IEPF. Sebi will really explore. We will facilitate use of registered transfer agents by IEPF for processing. We will help them to process any claim. Then in next two months we will conduct Niveshak Shivirs in Mumbai and Gujarat jointly with ministry of corporate affairs, where we will get top corporate RTAs where we have a large IEPF outstanding. They have ledgers and the companies are making efforts.We need to increase investor awareness. People coming to the stock market is a welcome thing. After all, you have to deploy your savings. The most important thing is that people should not be borrowing to invest. This is an issue where sometimes you do learn by some sagacious advice from your friends and relatives. Sometimes, you get lured into some riskier ventures on the advice of some of your sagacious peers. Then sometimes you lose money.The point is that it’s like a behavioural issue. And in behaviour, you can have an awareness element. We would like to up that awareness element. Mutual fund industry is doing its own awareness drives. So, everybody doesn’t get into very risky things. Because some of the people can get attracted to very abnormal gains, which some listed companies might show. On the awareness part, we would like to upscale our efforts more together as an ecosystem. Ideally, we should also collaborate with other regulators and work together for financial awareness of a higher order.","Will bring in four elements of trust, transparency, technology and teamwork under triple mandate of investment protection, development of markets and regulation of markets.

RBI proposes new route for offloading bad loans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/rbi-proposes-new-route-for-offloading-bad-loans/articleshow/120217704.cms,"MUMBAI: RBI has proposed a new route for banks and NBFCs to offload bad loans, allowing them to bundle and sell stressed assets directly to investors through special purpose entities set up by regulated financial firms. Until now, only asset reconstruction companies handled such assets. The move, announced with the April monetary policy, is intended to broaden the market for distressed debt and reduce dependence on ARCs.A key feature is the appointment of resolution managers, tasked with recovering value from the underlying assets. These must be independent of the originating lender. For such loans, RBI-regulated entities can act as resolution managers. For others, insolvency professionals and regulated institutions may qualify. Lenders must gradually provision for the securitised notes over five years. Capital requirements vary with recovery ratings, favoring senior tranches. Any exposure left after five years is to be marked down to Re 1.With the new dispensation, ARCs may lose some of their market. Larger cases are presently going to the NARCL, and the new framework will now allow lenders to bypass ARCs for mid-sized and retail loans. RBI has also mandated that ARCs must raise their net owned fund to Rs 300 crore by FY26, a threshold many have yet to meet. The new framework retains a key principle of RBI's regulations on bad loans that are aimed at preventing defaulters getting control of their assets through the back door.","Until now, only asset reconstruction companies handled such assets.
