Bill Belichick’s power play with 24-year-old girlfriend Jordon Hudson raises eyebrows over her growing football influence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/bill-belichicks-power-play-with-24-year-old-girlfriend-jordon-hudson-raises-eyebrows-over-her-growing-football-influence/articleshow/120326869.cms,"Credit: Getty Images

How much influence does Jordon Hudson have on Bill Belichick’s future?



As Bill Belichick starts his collegiate chapter at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill , his transition has sparked considerable attention—not just for his legendary resume, but for the growing presence of his girlfriend, Jordon Hudson , in his professional sphere. From sideline appearances to being copied in administrative emails, Hudson’s involvement has ignited a flurry of questions about her role in shaping Belichick’s new tenure.At 72, Bill Belichick accepted a five-year, $10 million-per-season deal in December to coach the Tar Heels. While fans celebrated the historic hire, viral videos—like the TikTok clip showing Jordon Hudson strolling the sidelines during spring practice—have pushed public curiosity into overdrive. Viewed over 400,000 times, the clip has many questioning, not just her presence, but her influence within Belichick’s evolving operations at UNC.This intrigue deepened after it was revealed that Belichick had requested Hudson be CC'd on communications related to his coaching activities. “Robbi, Thank you for the e-mail. I am including Jordon on this email so she can also keep up with our postings. Can you include her on anything you send to me? Thank you. BB,” he wrote to Robbi Pickeral Evans, the Senior Associate Athletic Director at UNC. The move was interpreted by some as signaling a larger advisory role for Hudson—one extending far beyond personal companionship.Documents obtained by The Athletic via an open records request show a deeper connection between Hudson and Belichick’s strategic decisions. Despite having no formal employment agreement with the university, Hudson’s input was sought—or at least acknowledged—on matters ranging from media strategy to staff announcements. Most notably, she advised UNC on how to present the hiring of Stephen Belichick, urging them to highlight his qualifications independently of his father's legacy. “Though Steve Belichick is in fact Bill’s son, he should be depicted and represented as his own established, credible entity… Steve was fortunate to have learned defensive football strategy from the ‘greatest defensive mind’ of all-time,” she wrote.Beyond emails, Hudson appears to be integrated into Belichick’s broader branding efforts. Her email signature identifies her as the Chief Operating Officer of “Belichick Productions,” a company without publicly available records. She also manages TCE Rights Management, which has filed for 14 trademarks, including “Chapel Bill” and “The Belichick Way.” These trademarks suggest an intent to shape Belichick's identity in the college football space as more than just a coach—perhaps a brand unto himself.Hudson’s involvement also extends into public image management. She questioned whether UNC was monitoring social media for negative commentary about Belichick. “Is there anyone monitoring the UNC Football page for slanderous commentary and subsequently deleting it / blocking users that are harassing BB in the comments?” she asked. The next day, Belichick expressed dismay: “I cannot believe that UNC would support my being called a ‘predator.’” Though the university found no such reference, they assured both parties that inappropriate comments would be addressed.What remains clear is that Jordon Hudson’s role, though unofficial, is increasingly influential in shaping Bill Belichick’s narrative off the field. As North Carolina looks to turn a new page with one of the most successful NFL minds at the helm, eyes will remain not only on Belichick’s playbook—but also on the woman who might just be helping to write it.Also Read: Why is Josh Allen's fiance Hailee Steinfeld missing from the Avengers: Doomsday cast reveal?

No, it's a sign of weakness. Yes, it will help them refocus.

Intel has agreed to sell a 51% stake in its Altera programmable chip business to private equity firm Silver Lake for $4.46 billion, marking the first significant move by new CEO Lip-Bu Tan to revitalize the struggling chipmaker.The deal, announced Monday, values Altera at $8.75 billion—nearly half the $17 billion Intel paid when acquiring the company in 2015. Despite the significant write-down, the transaction provides Intel with crucial cash as it works to strengthen its financial position following costly manufacturing investments made under former CEO Pat Gelsinger.Asset divestiture forms a central component of Tan's strategy to streamline Intel's operations after years of unsuccessful diversification attempts beyond its core PC and server chip business. These missteps have left Intel struggling to compete in the AI market dominated by Nvidia, while simultaneously facing increased pressure from AMD in its traditional central processor stronghold.""Today's announcement reflects our commitment to sharpening our focus, lowering our expense structure and strengthening our balance sheet,"" said Tan, who replaced Gelsinger in December following his ouster.The transaction is expected to close in the second half of 2025, after which Intel will deconsolidate Altera's financial results. Raghib Hussain, previously an executive at custom AI chipmaker Marvell, will take over as Altera's CEO beginning May 5.Altera generated $1.54 billion in revenue in 2024—representing just 3% of Intel's total sales—while posting an operating loss of $615 million. Intel's attempt to shift Altera's production in-house from TSMC proved costly and resulted in market share losses to rival Xilinx, now owned by AMD.Industry analysts expect further asset sales as Intel continues to refocus on its core businesses, with the company's majority stake in self-driving technology firm Mobileye Global considered another potential divestiture candidate.","Intel has agreed to sell a 51% stake in its altera programmable chip business to private equity firm silver lake for $4.46 billion.

Below is the available information to provide a comprehensive and up-to-date overview of what fans can expect from GTA 6 .According to multiple industry insiders and leaks, Rockstar Games is aiming for a release of GTA 6 on September 17, 2025.

Melinda Gates responds to Bill Gates statement that their divorce was biggest regret of his life: He's got his ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/melinda-gates-responds-to-bill-gates-statement-that-their-divorce-was-biggest-regret-of-his-life-hes-got-his-/articleshow/120290194.cms,"Melinda Gates says she suffered panic attacks

Melinda French Gates has opened up about her 2021 divorce from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, calling the split “necessary” despite her ex-husband recently describing it as the biggest regret of his life. In a January interview, Bill Gates said ending their 27-year marriage was ""at the top of the list"" when it came to personal failures. The couple, who married in 1994, officially parted ways in August 2021.Recently, in a candid interview with The Times, French Gates addressed those comments, saying: “If you can’t live your values out inside your most intimate relationship, it was necessary.” While she chose not to directly respond to her ex-husband’s remarks, she noted: “I don’t even quite know what to make of that statement, so I’m not going to comment on what he says. He’s got his own life. I have my life now. I am very happy.”French Gates also spoke about the emotional toll of the divorce, revealing she suffered panic attacks during the separation. “When you’re leaving a marriage, it’s very, very hard. And the negotiations were tough,” she said.She shared that her first panic attack occurred in 2014 while having lunch with Gates, prompting her to begin therapy. “I’d heard of people having panic attacks and I didn’t know if it was a real thing,” she said.Initially skeptical of therapy, French Gates admitted she later came to understand its value. “It doesn’t mean I’m damaged,” she explained. “It means I’ve been through some difficult things that I need to figure out.”The former couple share three adult children—Jennifer, 28, Rory, 25, and Phoebe, 22—and are now grandparents to two. While Bill Gates has been dating Paula Hurd, widow of former Oracle CEO Mark Hurd, since 2022, French Gates confirmed she is currently single and enjoying the dating scene.","Melinda french gates has opened up about her 2021 divorce from bill gates.

Donald Trump: I helped Apple CEO Tim Cook recently and that whole ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/donald-trump-i-helped-apple-ceo-tim-cook-recently-and-that-whole-/articleshow/120308353.cms,"Donald Trump exempts phones, computers, and chips from newly imposed tariffs

Apple again surpasses Microsoft as most valuable company

US President Donald Trump has asserted his direct involvement in securing a relief for Apple as the tech giant’s stock experienced a surge of over 2%, propelling its market capitalisation back above the $3 trillion mark. The iPhone maker experienced this surge after the Trump administration announced temporary tariff exemptions on phones, computers and chips.“I speak to Tim Cook. I helped Tim Cook , recently, and that whole business,” Trump said on Monday (April 14) in a briefing with reporters in the Oval Office, referring to Apple’s CEO.“I don’t want to hurt anybody, but the end result is we’re going to get to the position of greatness for our country,” he added.Trump's comment underscored his administration’s decision to exempt phones, computers and chips (semiconductors) from newly-imposed tariffs, a move crucial for Apple, which manufactures the majority of its iPhones, iPads and MacBooks in China, India and other Asian countries. The President has urged Apple to shift its production locally.However, administration officials have cautioned that these exemptions are temporary, leaving Apple's future tariff burden uncertain.As per CNBC, analysts at Morgan Stanley indicated that the latest developments have reduced Apple's “annualised tariff cost burden” from $44 billion to $7 billion.Nevertheless, Apple has reclaimed its position as the most valuable publicly traded US company, surpassing Microsoft. This followed a dip below the $3 trillion threshold on April 4, triggered by Trump's announcement of “reciprocal tariffs” that would significantly impact China and other manufacturing hubs.Reports said that Apple transported over 1.5 million iPhones aboard six cargo planes from India to minimise the impact of tariffs. Projections indicated that the iPhones that cost $1,599 (top-end iPhone 16 Pro Max in the US) could have surged to $2,300 under the high tariff rate that had been in effect, if Apple imported the phones from China.","Donald trump exempts phones, computers, and chips from newly imposed tariffs.

On Monday, April 14, an all-female crew including NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, astronaut Amanda Nguyen, filmmaker Kerianne Flynn, and celebrities Lauren Sánchez, Katy Perry , and Kelly King will launch on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos-owned Blue Origin ’s first all-female space mission. The historic flight, departing around 9:30 a.m. ET, marks a milestone for Jeff Bezos ’ company, with the crew wearing custom-designed astronaut suits by Monse.The suits, crafted from flame-resistant stretch neoprene, were tailored to each woman’s body using 3-D scans for a precise fit. Sanchez, 55, collaborated with Monse co-founders Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim starting in late 2024 to design suits that balance function with style. “Usually, these suits are made for a man,” Sánchez told The New York Times, explaining that previous suits were merely tailored for women. The new designs include features like calf zippers for flared legs, aiming to be both flattering and functional.Sánchez described the suits as “elegant” with “a little spice,” while Garcia cited motocross outfits and ski suits as inspirations, emphasizing simplicity with a “dangerous” edge. “I almost put a corset in your suit,” Garcia teased Sánchez, who said she would have embraced it. Sánchez stressed the importance of functionality, recalling prototype tests where she stretched and bent to ensure durability, saying, “Let’s make sure it doesn’t split up the back in space.”The crew also shared their pre-flight glam plans with Elle. “Who would not get glam before the flight?!” Sánchez said, noting they’ll wear lash extensions in the capsule. Perry, 40, added, “Space is going to finally be glam. We are going to put the ‘ass’ in astronaut.” King, 70, joined in the excitement for their stylish space debut.Announced in February 2025, the mission highlights a shift toward inclusivity in space exploration, with the crew’s custom suits symbolizing both innovation as well as empowerment.","An all-female crew including nasa rocket scientist aisha bowe, astronaut amanda nguyen, filmmaker kerianne flynn, and celebrities lauren sánchez, katy perry, and kelly king will launch on amazon founder jeff bezos-owned blue origin ’s first all- female space mission.

Gensol promoters banned from market for fund diversion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/gensol-promoters-banned-from-market-for-fund-diversion/articleshow/120329094.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: Markets regulator Sebi on Tuesday barred the two promoters of Gensol Engineering , Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi, from the securities markets until further notice due to fund misappropriation and governance issues Additionally, both the promoters have been barred from serving as directors or in any key managerial position in Gensol. The regulator also ordered the company to suspend its recently announced stock split. Sebi has also said that a forensic auditor will be appointed to scrutinise the accounts of Gensol and its associated parties.The orders by Sebi came after it investigated the company and its promoters. The investigation was started after the regulator received complaints in June 2024 regarding share price manipulation and fund diversion from Gensol.A29-page interim order by Ashwani Bhatia, whole time member, Sebi said that prima facie findings had shown “misutilisation and diversion of funds of the company in a fraudulent manner by its promoter directors…who are also the direct beneficiaries of the di verted funds”. The report also noted that the company had attempted to mislead Sebi, the credit rating agencies, the lenders and the investors “by submitting forged conduct letters purportedly issued by its lenders”.This is an interim order and a detailed investigation into the matter is going on. Sebi’s investigation revealed that Anmol and Puneet Singh Jaggi had used part of the funds that were raised through loans for buying electric cars for ride-hailing business under the BluSmart brand to purchase a luxury flat in Delhi.

Millions tune in for 24-hour live coverage of Sweden's epic moose migration,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/millions-tune-in-for-24-hour-live-coverage-of-swedens-epic-moose-migration/articleshow/120308747.cms,"File Photo (AP)

Before Swedish slow TV hit "" The Great Moose Migration "" began airing Tuesday, Ulla Malmgren stocked up on coffee and prepared meals so she doesn't miss a moment of the 20-day, 24-hour event.""Sleep? Forget it. I don't sleep,"" she said.Malmgren, 62, isn't alone. The show, called "" Den stora algvandringen "" in Swedish, and sometimes translated as ""The Great Elk Trek"" in English, began in 2019 with nearly a million people watching. In 2024, the production hit 9 million viewers on SVT Play , the streaming platform for national broadcaster SVT.The livestream kicked off a week ahead of schedule due to warm weather and early moose movement. Malmgren was ready.From now until May 4, the livestream's remote cameras will capture dozens of moose as they swim across the Angerman River, some 300 kilometers (187 miles) northwest of Stockholm, in the annual spring migration toward summer grazing pastures.Not much happens for hours at a time, and fans say that's the beauty of it.""I feel relaxed, but at the same time I'm like, 'Oh, there's a moose. Oh, what if there's a moose? I can't go to the toilet!'"" said William Garp Liljefors, 20, who has collected more than 150 moose plush toys since 2020.Slow TV success ""The Great Moose Migration "" is part of a trend that began in 2009 with Norwegian public broadcaster NRK's minute-by-minute airing of a seven-hour train trip across the southern part of the country.The slow TV style of programming has spread, with productions in the United Kingdom, China and elsewhere. The central Dutch city of Utrecht, for example, installed a "" fish doorbell "" on a river lock that lets livestream viewers alert authorities to fish being held up as they migrate to spawning grounds.Annette Hill, a professor of media and communications at Jonkoping University in Sweden, said slow TV has roots in reality television but lacks the staging and therefore feels more authentic for viewers. The productions allow the audience to relax and watch the journey unfold.""It became, in a strange way, gripping because nothing catastrophic is happening, nothing spectacular is happening,"" she said. ""But something very beautiful is happening in that minute-by-minute moment.""As an expert and a fan of ""The Great Moose Migration,"" Hill said the livestream helps her slow down her day by following the natural rhythms of spring.""This is definitely a moment to have a calm, atmospheric setting in my own home, and I really appreciate it,"" she said.Nature in your living room The calming effect extends to the crew, according to Johan Erhag, SVT's project manager for ""The Great Moose Migration.""""Everyone who works with it goes down in their normal stress,"" he said.The moose have walked the route for thousands of years, making it easy for the crew to know where to lay some 20,000 meters (almost 12 miles) of cable and position 26 remote cameras and seven night cameras. A drone is also used.The crew of up to 15 people works out of SVT's control room in Umea, producing the show at a distance to avoid interfering with the migration.SVT won't say how much the production costs, but Erhag said it's chewhen accounting for the 506 hours of footage aired last year.Erhag said Swedes have always been fascinated by the roughly 300,000 moose roaming in their woods. The Scandinavian country's largest animal is known as ""King of the Forest."" A bull moose can reach 210 centimeters (6 feet 10 inches) at shoulder height and weigh 450 kilograms (992 pounds).Despite their size, the herbivores are typically shy and solitary.""We actually don't see it very often. You often see it when you're out driving maybe once or twice in your life,"" Erhag said. ""I think that's one thing why it has been so, so popular. And then you bring in the nature to everyone's living room.""Hanna Sandberg, 36, first began watching the show in 2019, though she didn't spot any moose. She tuned in the following year, finally saw some and got hooked.""You can watch them and be a part of their natural habitat in a way that you could never be otherwise,"" she said.Moose mega-fans After hours of showing an empty forest, a camera captures footage of a moose approaching the riverbank. Suddenly, slow TV turns urgent.The push alert hits SVT's app - ""Forsta algarna i bild!"" which translates to ""First moose on camera!"" - as viewers worldwide tune in. The livestream's chat explodes as commenters type encouragement for the animal, now making its way into the water.""I would actually like to be a little fly on the wall in every household that watches the moose migration. Because I think there is about a million people saying about the same thing: 'Go on! Yes, you can do it!'"" Malmgren said.Mega-fans like Malmgren, who is in a Facebook group of 76,000-plus viewers, are committed to watching as many hours as possible.""I was late to school because I saw moose and my teacher was like, 'What, you saw moose in the city?' And I was like, 'No, it's on the TV,'"" Garp Liljefors said.Malmgren said friends and family have learned not to bother her when the moose are on the move.""When someone asks me, 'What are you doing? Oh, never mind, it's the great migration,'"" she said. ""They know.""","The 20-day, 24-hour event kicks off a week ahead of schedule due to warm weather and early moose movement.

Ms Fixit: TCS's Aarthi Subramanian becomes Indian IT's first woman COO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tcss-new-coo-aarthi-breaks-it-glass-ceiling/articleshow/120294128.cms,"Aarthi Subramanian

BENGALURU/MUBAI: TCS has appointed Aarthi Subramanian as its president and COO, overseeing operations of the $30 billion IT firm. This appointment marks a significant milestone as she becomes the first woman COO in the Indian IT sector, where gender diversity at the top is woefully skewed.She started as a graduate trainee in TCS in 1989 and rose in ranks to earn the moniker ""Ms Fixit"". She became a dependable troubleshooter to rely upon due to her expertise in delivery excellence, account stewardship, and large-scale programme management. Subramanian later took charge as the head of governance, compliance, and risk management in 2014 and oversaw HR and legal compliances and internal controls at TCS. Before her role as the global head of delivery excellence, she served as the head of delivery for seven years within the TCS retail and consumer packaged goods business unit, where she oversaw many strategic accounts. She was instrumental in setting up the SAP Centre of Excellence in Chennai and drove business excellence, front-ending many customer visits along with the CTO's office.TCS has expanded its executive framework by bringing in Subramanian from Tata Sons, where she was the group chief digital officer for eight years, driving digital technology, innovation, and AI at the group.“The firm is implementing a contextual reset to remain relevant and connected with customers in an AI-driven world, and Aarthi is the right candidate,” said an industry source. A Tata Group insider described Subramanian as a ""very good professional"" who commands significant respect within the Tata Group’s ecosystem. She is also a confidante of Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran—both having worked together in TCS and later at Tata Sons—and has his ear, the source told TOI.In 2017, she was appointed chief digital officer of Tata Sons, transitioning from an executive director of TCS to a non-executive director of the software services company. She also represented Tata Sons—the principal investment company and promoter of Tata enterprises—on the boards of Tata Capital, Tata AIA Life Insurance, Infiniti Retail (Croma), and Tata Electronics. From May 1, the 58-year-old leader will assume the COO position at TCS, moving from non-executive to executive director. This role change requires her to step down from her board positions at Tata Capital, Tata AIA Life Insurance, Infiniti Retail, and Tata Electronics, giving her more time to concentrate on improving TCS' delivery capabilities.Indian IT firms have had few women executives as presidents of business divisions. Subramanian is the pioneering executive to assume this leadership role. In fact, the role was vacant after its former COO N Ganapathy Subramaniam retired from the firm last year after being with the firm for four decades. “I think it’s a very astute appointment and a powerful statement across the Indian tech industry to elevate more women into leadership roles. My view on succession is that she is now on a platform to demonstrate her leadership qualities,” said Phil Fersht, CEO of US-based IT advisory HfS Research. “Indian-heritage IT services firms have been paying lip service to gender diversity, so this is the first major step in the right direction for the industry and a real example for the other firms to follow.”TCS CEO K Krithivasan, in the earnings presser, said, “She knows TCS quite well. She was part of the TCS board while also serves as the chief digital officer of Tata Group. She brings extensive experience regarding how the business has performed and how it has adopted technology.” Her COO tenure concludes in 2030 when she reaches 63. The incumbent CEO Krithivasan will retire in 2029 when he turns 65, adhering to the company's retirement policy for managing directors and executive directors.It's premature to predict what the board of TCS will determine in 2029—whether to elevate Subramanian to the managing director's position or designate a new candidate to succeed Krithivasan. Subramanian is an alumnus of the National Institute of Technology, Warangal, and holds a master’s degree in engineering management from the University of Kansas.",Tcs has appointed aarthi subramanian as its president and coo.
