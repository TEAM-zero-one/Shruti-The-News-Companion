Shilo Sanders' net worth in 2025: From bankruptcy to NFL success with the Buccaneers

The bankruptcy filing: Legal woes impacting his net worth



Endorsement deals: NIL success before the NFL



Asset management and legal scrutiny: A closer look



Shilo Sanders, son of NFL Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, has always been in the spotlight, and in 2025, he's making headlines again. After going undrafted in the 2025 NFL Draft, he managed to secure a three-year, $2.965 million contract with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers . But Shilo's financial journey isn't a simple success story, it’s layered with legal battles, financial hurdles, and a major comeback that’s still unfolding.Here’s a detailed look at his financial journey, net worth, and future outlook.Shilo Sanders' signing with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers is a big deal, not just for his football career but also for his finances. As an undrafted free agent, he secured a three-year, $2.965 million contract. While this deal doesn’t make him an instant millionaire, it opens doors to long-term success, if he can make the roster. His contract breaks down to an average annual salary of about $988,333, which is a solid start for an undrafted player.However, the real financial opportunity comes in securing a spot on the team’s 53-man roster, which could unlock performance bonuses, incentives, and sponsorships, allowing Shilo to significantly boost his net worth in the coming years.Despite the recent NFL signing, Shilo Sanders has faced significant financial challenges. In October 2023, he filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, citing liabilities totaling a staggering $11.3 million. The debt primarily stems from a legal judgment against him, following a 2015 incident when he allegedly assaulted a security guard. The court ruled that Sanders owed $11.89 million in damages.At the time of the filing, Sanders listed his assets as being worth around $320,000. These assets included personal property and a 2023 Mercedes-Benz, which reportedly faced repossession efforts due to missed payments. Sanders' bankruptcy case has complicated his financial standing, and the resolution of his legal and debt issues will play a significant role in shaping his net worth moving forward.While Sanders’ financial situation has been strained by his bankruptcy, he also capitalized on Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) deals during his time at the University of Colorado. Before making the leap to the NFL, Shilo secured several lucrative endorsement deals. Brands like Porsche of Jackson, Actively Black, Google, Tint My Ride, EA Sports, and Starz signed him to promote their products and services.His NIL valuation was estimated to be around $539,000, and he ranked among the top 100 college athletes in terms of NIL earnings. These deals not only contributed to his earnings but also boosted his public profile, paving the way for his NFL contract.Shilo’s financial journey is not without controversy. During his bankruptcy proceedings, several financial discrepancies came to light. For example, Sanders had failed to disclose certain NIL deals and other income streams. Additionally, he owned companies like Big 21 LLC and SS21 LLC, which were purportedly used to manage his endorsement income.While Shilo Sanders is undoubtedly facing financial challenges, his NFL contract gives him a chance to turn things around. His three-year, $2.965 million deal with the Buccaneers provides a substantial base salary, but his real financial growth depends on his performance on the field and his ability to make the final roster.Also read - “I ain’t got no code yet”: Shilo Sanders cracks jokes on Day 1 with Bucs after surprise $2.9M NFL deal","Shilo sanders, son of nfl hall of famer deion sanders, went undrafted in the 2025 nfl draft.

So, guess what? Shilo Sanders—yep, Deion’s son and Colorado’s hard-hitting safety just pulled a major comeback flex. After going undrafted in the 2025 NFL Draft, the Tampa Bay Buccaneers signed him to a 3-year, $2.965 million deal. That’s right, Shilo is officially heading to the league, and he’s not just walking in quietly, he’s strutting in with something to prove.From the buzz on Twitter to his dad personally thanking the Bucs , this signing has already become one of the most talked-about post-draft moments.Shilo might’ve been snubbed, but now he’s got a shot to make the roster and silence the doubters for good.Let’s talk numbers. Shilo’s deal with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers is a standard undrafted free agent contract, three years for $2.965 million. It’s not headline-grabbing money, but it’s a major door-opening moment.Tampa Bay signed 15 undrafted rookies after the draft, and Shilo was one of the standout additions. While some thought he might land elsewhere or not at all, the Bucs clearly see the potential in the 24-year-old safety. Now, it’s all about training camp and showing he belongs in that pewter and red.On his first day at the Tampa Bay Buccaneers' rookie minicamp , Shilo arrived at the facility and cracked everyone up,The Buccaneers shared this moment on social media, highlighting his humor as he joined the team.Leave it to Deion to turn a free agent signing into a headline. After the deal was announced, Coach Prime reportedly called Bucs head coach Todd Bowles personally to thank him for giving Shilo a shot. You know he had that proud dad energy going.Deion’s been vocal all year about wanting NFL teams to take his kids seriously and this move shows the respect is finally coming. Whether you love or hate the Sanders clan, you can’t deny they move as a unit. And now, that unit just got an NFL contract added to the family group chat.Shilo isn’t just celebrating, he’s locked in. In true Sanders fashion, he’s already talking about proving people wrong. He’s got that underdog energy and a point to make.This signing might not have broken the internet, but it just might break open a new era for Shilo Sanders.

Apple plans to add AI Search in Safari browser; Senior VP Eddy Cue points to 3 Google rivals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-plans-to-add-ai-search-in-safari-browser-senior-vp-eddy-cue-points-to-3-google-rivals/articleshow/120993178.cms,"Apple in discussions with OpenAI, Perplexity and others

Apple is planning to add AI-powered search options in the Safari browser . According to a Bloomberg report, Apple’s senior vice president of services, Eddy Cue said during his testimony with the US Justice Department that the company is “actively looking at” reshaping Safari. During the testimony, he revealed that searches on Safari dipped for the first time last month.“That has never happened in 22 years,” he said, adding this is due to people using AI. Cue said he believes that AI tools like OpenAI , Perplexity AI and Anthropic’s Claude AI, will eventually replace search engines like Google Chrome, further adding that Apple will bring these options to Safari in the future.“We will add them to the list — they probably won’t be the default,” he said.Currently, Google is the default search engine on Apple’s Safari browser for which the company pays around $20 billion a year to keep. Analysts estimate this accounts for about 36% of the search advertising revenue Google earns through Safari.Cue said that Apple is in discussions with AI search providers like OpenAI, Perplexity and Anthropic to add their AI tools as an option to Safari.“Prior to AI, my feeling around this was, none of the others were valid choices,” he said. “I think today there is much greater potential because there are new entrants attacking the problem in a different way.”Apple currently integrates OpenAI’s ChatGPT into its Siri digital assistant and plans to add Google’s AI tool Gemini later this year. Cue said the company also considered other AI options, including Anthropic, Perplexity, China-based DeepSeek, and Grok from Elon Musk’s xAI.He added that the deal with OpenAI gives Apple the flexibility to bring in other AI providers to its operating system, including Apple’s own AI models.Google-parent company Alphabet’s shares dipped about 8% on Wednesday (May 7), wiping out $160 billion from the company’s market capitalisation following Eddy Cue’s testimony.","Apple in discussions with openai, perplexity and others to add their ai tools as an option to safari.

Jensen Huang's warning to US leaders: ‘Get American AI out in front’ or risk losing China AI market,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/jensen-huangs-warning-to-us-leaders-get-american-ai-out-in-front-or-risk-losing-china-ai-market/articleshow/120992439.cms,"Jensen Huang's warning to US leaders

Nvidia targets $50 billion in China's AI boom – why it can't afford to miss out

Impact of US export restrictions on Nvidia

Broader economic implications for the US

China’s rapid AI advancements and competitive threats

Financial performance and market outlook

The path forward: Balancing growth and national security

“The world is right now hungry, anxious to engage AI,”

“Let us get the American AI out in front of everybody right now.”

Nvidia , the world’s leading producer of graphics processing units (GPUs) and a dominant force in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry, is facing a critical challenge as US-China trade tensions continue to escalate. CEO Jensen Huang recently emphasized the significance of the Chinese AI market , which he estimates could reach $50 billion in the next two to three years.Speaking at ServiceNow’s Knowledge 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Huang described the potential loss of access to this market as ahighlighting the broader economic impact on US jobs, revenue, and technological leadership. This concern comes amid tighter US export restrictions that have significantly affected Nvidia’s business prospects in China, one of its largest international markets.China has long been a vital market for Nvidia, not only as a major consumer of its advanced AI chips but also as a hub for cutting-edge AI research and development. Nvidia’s GPUs, known for their unmatched parallel processing capabilities, are essential for training and deploying sophisticated AI models, making them indispensable for industries ranging from autonomous vehicles to cloud computing.Huang noted in his interview that China’s AI market could grow to $50 billion within the next two to three years, presenting a massive revenue opportunity. Given that Nvidia’s GPUs have become the backbone of the global AI industry, securing a share of this rapidly expanding market is critical for the company’s long-term growth.However, Nvidia’s ability to access this lucrative market has been increasingly constrained by US export controls aimed at limiting China’s technological advancements. Last month, the Trump administration further tightened these restrictions, requiring special licenses for Nvidia to ship its H20 chips to China. These chips, part of the Hopper architecture, were specifically designed to comply with earlier export regulations but are now caught in the latest wave of trade restrictions.As a result, Nvidia announced a staggering $5.5 billion quarterly charge, reflecting the financial blow of losing a critical revenue stream. This move marks one of the most significant financial impacts on the company since it became a trillion-dollar tech giant, raising concerns about the sustainability of its rapid growth.Huang highlighted the broader economic consequences of these export restrictions, emphasizing the potential loss of US jobs and tax revenue. During the interview, he argued that maintaining access to the Chinese market is not just about Nvidia’s bottom line but also about the long-term competitiveness of the US tech sector.“We just have to stay agile,” Huang said, stressing the importance of balancing national security concerns with the need for economic growth and technological leadership. He added that the ongoing restrictions could force Chinese companies to develop domestic alternatives, potentially reducing US influence in the global AI industry over the long term.Huang’s comments come amid growing concerns about China’s rapid progress in AI technology. At a separate tech conference in Washington, D.C., in April, Huang warned that China is “not behind” in AI and described Huawei as “one of the most formidable technology companies in the world.”This assessment aligns with recent reports indicating that Chinese firms like Huawei and DeepSeek have made significant strides in developing their own AI chips, potentially challenging Nvidia’s dominance in this critical sector. Huang’s remarks underscore the competitive pressure Nvidia faces as it navigates a complex geopolitical landscape.Despite these challenges, Nvidia remains a dominant force in the global AI market. The company’s market capitalization has approached $3 trillion, making it one of the most valuable tech companies in the world. However, its stock has experienced significant volatility in recent months, with shares down about 15% so far this year after nearly tripling in 2023.Nvidia is set to report its next quarterly earnings on May 28, with analysts expecting a 65% year-over-year revenue increase to $43.1 billion, according to data from LSEG. This projected growth reflects the ongoing demand for AI hardware, even as the company grapples with geopolitical uncertainties and supply chain challenges.Huang’s recent comments highlight the delicate balance Nvidia must strike as it seeks to maintain its leadership in the AI industry while navigating complex geopolitical challenges. As US policymakers weigh the risks and benefits of restricting high-tech exports to China, companies like Nvidia face tough decisions about how to adapt to an increasingly fragmented global market.Huang said during his Las Vegas appearance.With AI becoming a critical driver of economic growth and technological innovation, the stakes for Nvidia and the broader US tech sector have never been higher.","Jensen huang recently emphasized the significance of the chinese ai market, which he estimates could reach $50 billion in the next two to three years.

Addressing privacy concerns and ethical challenges

The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and digital technologies has brought both unprecedented opportunities and significant challenges, particularly in verifying online identities. In response to this, Sam Altman , the visionary co-founder of OpenAI, has introduced his latest ambitious endeavor, the World Project , in the United States. Previously known as Worldcoin, this initiative aims to revolutionize digital identity verification using biometric data, specifically through eye-scanning technology .The project, co-developed by Tools for Humanity, seeks to create a global, secure, and decentralized identity system that can differentiate humans from AI bots in an increasingly digital world. As the World Project officially launched in six US cities on May 1, 2025, it marked a significant step toward transforming online authentication and digital trust.The World Project is driven by a bold vision: to establish a universally accessible digital identity system that safeguards individual privacy while ensuring secure interactions online. The core technology behind this initiative is the Orb, a sleek, silver sphere designed to scan and encode a user’s unique iris pattern into an encrypted IrisCode. Unlike traditional username and password systems, which are vulnerable to hacking and phishing, the World ID offers a more secure alternative by using biometric data that cannot be easily replicated.Tools for Humanity, the company behind the World Project, was co-founded by Sam Altman and CEO Alex Blania. Their mission is to build a decentralized identity platform that can serve as a foundational layer for the digital economy, reducing fraud and restoring trust in online interactions. The World ID system promises to be a critical tool in combating the rise of deepfakes, AI-generated content, and bot-driven misinformation.The Orb is a key component of the World Project’s identity verification system. It captures a user’s iris pattern, transforming it into a unique IrisCode that is encrypted and stored on a blockchain. This approach offers significant security advantages:In the US, the initial rollout includes 7,500 Orbs deployed across six major cities: Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, and San Francisco. The company plans to quadruple its global hardware footprint by the end of 2025, further expanding the availability of World IDs.To encourage early adoption, the World Project offers users 14 WLD cryptocurrency tokens in exchange for participating in the iris-scanning process. These tokens, part of the broader World ecosystem, can be used for online transactions, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and digital identity verification.In addition to the Orb, the World Project is set to launch the World Card, a crypto-linked debit card developed in partnership with Visa. This card will allow users to spend their WLD tokens at any location that accepts Visa, bridging the gap between the digital and physical economies. This integration marks a significant step toward making digital currencies more practical and widely accepted.The US launch of the World Project comes with several high-profile partnerships aimed at integrating World ID into mainstream applications. Notably, Match Group, the parent company of Tinder, Hinge, and other dating platforms, is piloting World ID for identity verification on Tinder in Japan. This move is intended to reduce catfishing and online fraud by ensuring that users are verified humans. If successful, this technology could extend to other dating platforms, enhancing user trust and safety.Despite its ambitious goals, the World Project faces significant challenges, particularly around privacy and data security. Critics have raised concerns about the ethical implications of incentivizing biometric data collection with cryptocurrency rewards. Reports of coercion by Orb operators in some regions and the emergence of a black market for iris data have further complicated the project’s public perception.To address these concerns, the World Project has emphasized its commitment to transparency and data protection. The company claims that it does not store actual iris images and that its blockchain-based approach ensures that no single entity can control or misuse the data. Nevertheless, building public trust will be a critical factor in the project’s long-term success.","Openai's sam altman launched the world project in the us on may 1, 2025.

X has received executive orders from the Indian government requiring X to block over 8,000 accounts in India, subject to potential penalties including significant fines and imprisonment of the company’s local employees. The orders include demands to block access in India to accounts belonging to international news organizations and prominent X users.

Poll Do you think blocking accounts is an effective way to enforce local laws? No, it stifles communication Yes, it can deter illegal activity

In most cases, the Indian government has not specified which posts from an account have violated India's local laws. For a significant number of accounts, we did not receive any evidence or justification to block the accounts.

To comply with the orders, we will withhold the specified accounts in India alone. We have begun that process. However, we disagree with the Indian government’s demands. Blocking entire accounts is not only unnecessary, it amounts to censorship of existing and future content, and is contrary to the fundamental right of free speech.

This is not an easy decision, however keeping the platform accessible in India is vital to Indians’ ability to access information.

Lumio Vision 7 QLED TV review: More than what meets the eye,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tv-television/lumio-vision-7-qled-tv-review-more-than-what-meets-the-eye/articleshow/120795344.cms,"I feel the need… the need for speed!

Colour, clarity, and almost no misses

Sound is half of the picture

There. Quality construction.

Go-go-gadget remote!

Simple is better

TLDR for the Lumio Vision 7

Our rating: 4/5

The thing with modern, or should I just simply say smart, TVs is that performance has never been their strongest suite. They might boast the classiest designs, vibrant displays with perfect blacks and billions of colours, even sound that fills your living room with theatre-like quality, but somehow, inevitably, they all turn painfully slow. Whether it be a Rs 20,000 TV or Rs 5,00,000 one, the experience eventually deteriorates, and both are just going to stutter and lag through simple tasks like opening Netflix or switching between apps.This universal performance degradation represents one of the most frustrating paradoxes of modern technology.We've accepted as normal that our TVs, despite being ""smart,"" will inevitably grow slower and less responsive with each passing month. Unlike our phones or laptops where performance drives purchasing decisions, televisions have somehow escaped this scrutiny, with manufacturers focusing on picture quality and leaving the software experience as an afterthought.Now, there's whole debate on whom to blame. But, for now, let's just accept the fact that smart TVs are slow, and that's what piqued a small group of AV enthusiasts at Circuit House , who pondered the question: what if a TV doesn't have to slow down with age? What if the software and hardware could be designed from the ground up to maintain performance over years, not months? Their frustration with the status quo led to the creation of Lumio , tackling what the group believes is the ""slow TV epidemic."" To end that, they have created Vision TVs, calling it the ""India's fastest smart TV,” with ""BOSS processor"" and ""OMG RAM.”Well, the claim is bold, and something that definitely needs to be put to the test. But performance is just one piece of the puzzle. A TV's primary function remains visual — the quality of the panel, color accuracy, and brightness all matter tremendously when you're settling in for a movie night or binge-watching your favourite series. Lumio has even bolder claims here with what it's calling ""DOPE display"" and ""Damn Good Sound” (full marks to people at Circuit House for gen-Zfying the boring marketing jargons).So, could the Vision be the TV that most people need but don't know about? Or is it just another case of marketing jargon and overhyped specs? Or has Lumio actually addressed the core issues that plague our everyday viewing experience while excelling at everything that's fundamental to bingeing, making it the ""Flagship killer of smart TVs""? I put my regular TV on the side, and gave its place to Vision, for two straight weeks, and this is how it went.It's rare you see people talk about a television's performance chops, but with claims so bold, it's important we first get to it. So, just minutes after unboxing and setting up the TV, which was quite a task (thanks to Google), I was eager to see if the Lumio 7 truly delivered on speed. Well, I would just say that I'm genuinely surprised to discover a smart TV could be this fluid. Because over the dozen TVs that I've tried in the past half-decade or so, each one has inevitably lagged immediately after setup. This one, so far, has shown no lags or stutters.But how so? The Lumio 7 runs Google TV, the same OS found on several other TVs, yet they don't show this characteristic, so what makes the Lumio 7 so quick? The speed can be credited to the faster BOSS processor, which basically is 2x ARM Cortex A55 and 2x Cortex A75. Plus, 3 gigs of RAM, that’s one extra gigabyte than what's typically found on TVs and all the behind the scenes work that Lumio says it has done with Google. So, for a change, Google TV runs smoother. Not just the OS user interface, but the apps also open much quicker and run smoother than what I've experienced on TVs before. While there isn't an exact way to demonstrate this smoothness in a written piece, I can only tell you in words: it's so responsive that Google Assistant works without any hiccups. It listens to what I'm saying, and I get what I'm asking for, every single time, and it happens in a snap, which again, isn't the case on most TVs. Oh, and also, the TV powers on and off, in one click of power button.The Lumio Vision 7 's so-called ""DOPE display"" had me skeptical at first, marketing jargon rarely translates to real-world performance, yet the 55-inch QLED panel genuinely impresses with its out-of-box calibration. Firing up Dune: Part Two, the desert landscapes rendered with a surprising level of detail and dimensionality I hadn't expected at this price point.The claimed 114% DCI-P3 colour gamut coverage isn't just numbers on a spec sheet; it manifests in how the spice fields of Arrakis glow with an almost hypnotic orange-blue contrast that remains remarkably balanced rather than cartoonishly oversaturated. Where the panel does falter is during extremely dark scenes, the limitations of direct-lit QLED without local dimming zones become apparent as blacks shift to dark grey, particularly noticeable during the night attack sequences where shadow detail occasionally gets crushed.Moving beyond cinematic content, the Vision 7 handles everyday viewing with surprising competence. News channels and YouTube content appear crisp and clean, benefiting from what Lumio calls its ""Clarity Engine"" upscaling, a feature that, unlike competitors that seem to merely sharpen edges to fake detail, actually reconstructs lower resolution content intelligently.During IPL matches, grass textures and player jerseys maintain their vibrancy without the over saturation that plagues many budget QLEDs, though fast-moving cricket balls occasionally betray the panel's 60Hz limitation with slight motion blur. The anti-reflective coating deserves special mention—while not eliminating reflections entirely (no TV truly does), it diffuses light sources effectively enough that I could comfortably watch midday programming with sunlight streaming through nearby windows, a genuine quality-of-life improvement over similarly priced alternatives.HDR performance delivers mixed but mostly positive results. The panel's 400 nit peak brightness won't dazzle like premium offerings, yet Lumio's tone mapping demonstrates surprising sophistication. Streaming The Mandalorian in Dolby Vision, helmet reflections and lightsaber effects retain highlight detail rather than blowing out to featureless white blobs, suggesting thoughtful implementation rather than merely checking an HDR compatibility box.Colour volume in HDR content particularly impresses; the Vision 7 may not reach the retina-searing intensities of high-end displays, but what it does deliver feels accurately mapped to the panel’s capabilities. The compromises become evident primarily during extreme contrast scenes; while watching 1917, the night-time sequence where Schofield navigates the ruins under the harsh, flickering light of flares reveals the panel’s inability to simultaneously deliver deep blacks and bright highlights, resulting in a somewhat flattened visual experience compared to higher-end technologies.For gamers, the Vision 7's display brings both pleasant surprises and predictable limitations. Input lag measures an impressive 11.7ms in Game Mode—responsive enough for all but the most competitive players—while colour accuracy remains intact rather than sacrificed for speed as often happens with budget gaming displays. God of War Ragnarok showcases the panel's strengths with Atreus' red tunic popping against snowy landscapes without looking artificially enhanced, and environmental details maintaining clarity even during fast camera pans. The absence of 120Hz support will disappoint serious gamers, though at this price point such expectations would be unrealistic.The Vision 7's sound capabilities challenge the notion that TV speakers serve merely as stopgaps until soundbar acquisition. Its 30W quad-driver setup, two tweeters partnered with two full-range units, delivers audio that makes external systems feel less urgently needed.As I was rewatching The Crown,every hushed royal conversation cut through with startling clarity while maintaining perfect harmony with the show's orchestral score. The system hits its ceiling with truly bombastic scenes, though; during the climactic battle in Avengers: Endgame, the cosmic clashes lacked that gut-punching rumble only dedicated subwoofers provide, a reminder that physics remains undefeated when squeezing bass from slim enclosures.Spatial processing via Dolby Atmos creates a convincing illusion of sound extending beyond physical boundaries, though naturally falling short of what ceiling-mounted speakers would achieve. Volume capabilities impressed equally, rarely needing to push beyond 25-30% in my medium-sized living room.What stands out most is the Vision 7's ability to maintain clarity during acoustically challenging moments. The tunnel chase sequence in No Time to Die, a sonic battleground of gunfire, screeching tires, and crucial dialogue, somehow keeps conversations intelligible without reaching for remote adjustments.Live concert footage of Hans Zimmer Live revealed the system's limitations, however, with midrange congestion during complex orchestral passages and that missing octave of bass leaving dramatic crescendos feeling somewhat incomplete. Thankfully, when you eventually crave that absent low-end extension, eARC support via HDMI 1 ensures seamless integration with external audio systems, providing a surprisingly capable interim solution that doesn't demand immediate upgrading, a rarity at this price point.The Lumio Vision 7 brings a clean, practical design that manages to avoid most budget TV pitfalls without trying too hard to impress. This 55-inch panel employs near-invisible bezels on three sides that effectively disappear during viewing, creating a more immersive experience than you might expect at this price point. What's notable is how the Vision 7 achieves its streamlined look while maintaining decent build quality. The all-plastic construction is standard for the category, but Lumio has used materials with sufficient heft to prevent the flimsy feel that plagues many competitors.Wall-mounted installation requires purchasing a separate bracket (a common omission in this segment), while the included tabletop stands provide adequate stability despite their simple design—though their 99cm spacing demands considerable furniture width that smaller entertainment units might struggle to accommodate.Turn the Vision 7 around and you'll find thoughtful touches in port placement and accessibility. Unlike many TVs that seem determined to make connection access unnecessarily difficult, Lumio positions all interfaces on the left side with a reflective backing that actually helps you see what you're connecting without requiring a flashlight. The three HDMI 2.1 ports (one with eARC) provide solid connectivity options, though the clustered USB ports create an awkward situation when multiple peripherals need connecting simultaneously. The detachable power cable offers practical flexibility during installation, though the absence of dedicated cable routing means your entertainment center might still suffer from visible wire clutter depending on placement.The Vision 7 handles surprisingly well during setup and positioning. At 13.5kg (with stands), it strikes a reasonable balance between substance and manageable weight, allowing for solo installation without excessive struggle. The chassis shows minimal flexing when handled—a small but telling indicator of decent build quality that separates it from the flimsiest budget options.Often overlooked as mere accessories, remote controls frequently reveal a manufacturer's true attention to detail—and the aptly named ""Minion"" remote accompanying the Vision 7 speaks volumes about Lumio's priorities. This gunmetal grey controller eschews the plastic fantastic approach of budget competitors for something that feels genuinely considered. Its compact profile nestles naturally in the hand.The remote has a thoughtful tactile experience, certain buttons feature subtly elevated rubber textures that create intuitive navigation without requiring visual confirmation. This tactile way finding helps you avoid the typical mindless button-hunting experience into something almost pleasurable. While the absence of a customisable macro button proves occasionally limiting, especially for accessing region-specific streaming services lacking dedicated shortcuts, the inclusion of both IR and Bluetooth connectivity ensures responsive operation regardless of pointing angle.The dedicated TLDR button feels like a curious commitment of prime remote real estate to a single app, but there’s a purpose to it.While Lumio has been hyping up its television performance chops, the TLDR app has to be one of its most ambitious attempts to differentiate itself in the crowded smart TV ecosystem. This proprietary content discovery platform takes a fundamentally different approach from the algorithmic recommendations that dominate most streaming interfaces. Rather than overwhelming users with endless rows of content suggestions, TLDR presents a refreshingly focused vertical-scrolling interface with horizontal content cards that emphasise quality over quantity.The current implementation primarily highlights Sports and Music categories, with clean typography and intuitive navigation that feels purposeful rather than cluttered. Sports fans will appreciate how match schedules, live scores, and highlights are seamlessly integrated, though the current limitation to just IPL, EPL and a handful of other leagues reveals the platform's early stage development. The music discovery section shows similar promise with curated playlists and trending tracks, though navigation between these different content verticals occasionally requires more taps than ideal, especially when searching for specific teams or artists.The integration feels substantially more polished than the half-baked proprietary apps that often ship with budget TVs, suggesting genuine investment rather than box-checking. That said, TLDR's long-term utility remains somewhat questionable until Lumio expands beyond its initial content categories. The dedicated remote button offers convenient access but feels premature for an app still building its feature set, especially when that space could have been used for a customisable shortcut to compensate for missing streaming service buttons.The Lumio Vision 7 shatters the resigned acceptance we've developed toward sluggish smart TVs. Starting at Rs 29,999 a, this QLED offering delivers what countless other manufacturers have somehow deemed impossible: a wholesome user experience. It feels like someone finally bothered to ask what people actually want from their TVs. Yes, flashy marketing terms like ""BOSS processor"" and ""DOPE display"" initially raised my skepticism, but after spending two weeks with this TV, they do live up to their names, and it isn't just fancy specs but the Lumio is playing on how the whole package comes together.The QLED panel delivers vibrant colours and sharp details that hold up well for movies and sports alike, though sit too far off-center and you'll notice colours washing out—a reminder you're not playing with OLED money here. Dark scenes reveal another limitation: blacks look more dark grey than true black, especially noticeable during night scenes where shadow details sometimes get lost in the murk. Still, the display handles visual content with surprising competence, preserving highlights without the blinding overexposure cheaper TVs often default to.The interface doesn't make you wait, apps open when you click them, and Google Assistant actually responds when called, small victories that shouldn't feel revolutionary but somehow do. The sound system delivers unexpectedly clear dialogue and decent spatial effects, though action scenes remind you there's only so much bass tiny speakers can muster. The remote deserves special mention, its textured buttons and solid feel make the daily ritual of finding something to watch less irritating, even if that dedicated TLDR button seems like an odd choice for prime real estate when the app itself still needs more content.Practical touches like side-mounted ports you can actually see without a flashlight and a clean design with minimal bezels show attention to what matters, though those wide-set stands (99cm apart) might not fit narrower TV cabinets.For too long, we've judged TVs almost exclusively on panel technology while accepting compromises in other areas. The Lumio Vision 7 presents a more balanced package without sacrificing picture quality, offering a viewing experience enhanced by software — sounds exactly like what smart TVs should have been.The Vision 7 isn't trying to reinvent television, it simply refuses to accept that affordable TVs must inevitably lag and stutter through basic tasks. In a market flooded with alternatives from Xiaomi , TCL, and Hisense all battling over spec sheets, Lumio's focus on the complete user experience creates a TV that just works, perhaps the most refreshing feature of all. With exclusive availability through Amazon and warranty coverage across 19,000+ pin codes, Lumio addresses the typical new-brand service concerns head-on. This thoughtful approach to both product and support makes the Lumio Vision 7 a compelling for anyone seeking a genuinely well-rounded viewing experience without breaking the bank.","The lumio vision 7 runs google tv, the same os found on several other tvs. The speed can be credited to the faster boss processor, which basically is 2x arm cortex a55 and 2x cortex a75.

AUSTIN: Google will pay $1.4 billion to Texas to settle claims the company collected users' data without permission, the state's attorney general announced Friday.

Batey won (NYT photo)





Walking into the crowded hotel conference room, Andrew Batey looked like any other tech guy attending ETHDenver, an annual cryptocurrency conference. A venture capital investor based in Florida, Batey, however, was at the conference not to network but to fight one of them - live on YouTube. At the hotel, a short drive from the conference convention center, under the watchful eye of a representative from the Colorado Combative Sports Commission, Batey, 40, stripped down to his boxers.He weighed in at just under 195 pounds, on target for the fight. The bare-chested venture capitalist raised his biceps and flexed for cameras.America's tech elite, not content with unfathomable wealth and rising political influence in Washington, have recently developed a new obsession - fighting. Across the United States, men like Batey are learning to punch, kick, knee, elbow and, in some cases, hammer an opponent over the head with their fists. The figurehead of the movement is Mark Zuckerberg, the billionaire CEO of Meta , who has charted his impressive physical transformation from skinny computer nerd to martial arts fighter on Instagram, one of the apps he owns.The tech industry's newfound devotion to martial arts is one facet of a broader cultural shift that has upended US politics. Many of these tech founders-turned-fighters are chasing a testosterone-heavy ideal of masculinity that is ascendant on social media and embraced by President Donald Trump. An enthusiastic practitioner of Brazilian jujitsu, Zuckerberg, 40, lamented this year that corporate culture was getting ""neutered"" and was devoid of ""masculine energy."" In 2023, Zuckerberg's fellow billionaire Elon Musk, a longtime corporate rival, challenged him to a televised cage match. But that fight never took place.Most of the tech world's aspiring fighters have a crucial thing in common: Before they started pursuing their extravagant new hobby, they made a lot of money.In 2018, Batey founded Beatdapp, a company that develops software to eliminate fraud in music streaming. He also runs a venture capital firm, Side Door Ventures, that invests in crypto startups.Two years ago, Batey's venture fund invested $500,000 in Karate Combat , a would-be competitor to the Ultimate Fighting Championship. The league operates as a hybrid between an athletic competition and a tech startup. Rather than offering traditional shares, Karate Combat gave Batey's firm Karate tokens - a cryptocurrency that fans can wager on Karate Combat fights, which stream on YouTube as well as TV channels like ESPN Deportes. Karate Combat's primary business is professional fighting - mixed martial arts contests featuring seasoned athletes, some of whom also fight in UFC. (A representative for Karate Combat declined to reveal how much money the league generates.)Last year, the company created a new competition for amateurs and started offering it as the undercard at pro events, which are sometimes held at crypto conferences. The competition was called Influencer Fight Club , and its premise was simple: Put a couple of tech guys in the ring and see what happens.Over the past 18 months, the competition has featured some big names in the crypto world, including Nic Carter, a venture investor known for his combative posts on the social site X. At a crypto conference in Nashville, Tennessee, last summer, Carter, boasting an impressive physique, knocked out a tattooed crypto marketer in one round. On social media, he was hailed as ""kingly"" and adopted the nickname ""Tungsten Daddy. ""","Venture capitalist andrew batey, 40, fought a crypto entrepreneur in denver in february.

The Indian pharmaceutical market continued rising in April 2025, achieving a strong annual growth of 7.8%, with total sales reaching a remarkable Rs 19,711 crore.According to a report by Pharmatrack, the sector recorded an impressive Rs 1,424 crore in additional sales this month, highlighting its continued resilience and strong demand.The report attributed the growth primarily to price-led expansion, as well as the impact of new product introductions (NIS). On a moving annual total (MAT) basis, the industry surged to Rs 2,27,361 crore, reflecting an 8.3 per cent increase year-on-year and a healthy 10.3 per cent Compound annual growth rate (CAGR). These figures highlight the sector’s long-term growth potential and strong position in the market.Therapeutic segments such as cardiac, neuro/CNS, blood-related, anti-neoplastics, ophthalmology/otology, and urology were major contributors to the momentum in April, as the importance of speciality and chronic therapies continues to grow, driving the market's expansion.Despite modest volume growth of just 0.4 per cent, the industry’s effective pricing strategies enabled it to manage cost pressures and maintain topline growth.Among the therapy areas, cardiac and anti-Infectives saw major volume boosts in April because of sustained demand in chronic disease management and acute care needs, respectively.The cardiac therapy segment, in particular, showed strong performance, driven by continuous demand for anti-hypertensives, lipid lowering agents, and heart failure therapies. Meanwhile, the anti-infectives sector rose from seasonal infections and localised outbreaks, leading to a noticeable volume surge.From a pricing perspective, Respiratory therapy led the charge with a 6.6 per cent price increase, followed by Cardiac and Gastrointestinal therapies, reflecting pricing dynamics in high-demand categories.The report also highlighted the success of stomatologicals, which emerged as a standout in new product performance, registering a 7.7 per cent growth. This growth was largely driven by launches in specialised care areas where competition remains relatively low and demand is evolving.","The indian pharmaceutical market continued rising in april 2025, achieving a strong annual growth of 7.8%.

Amazon revamps pay structure: What it means for 'high-performing' tech employees,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/amazon-revamps-pay-structure-what-it-means-for-high-performing-tech-employees/articleshow/121055652.cms,"Amazon's new pay model for 'high-performing' employees:

Amazon's new pay model for first-time achievers include:

First-time Highly Valued 3 (HV3) performers will get 40% of their pay range instead of 50%.

Employees moving up to Highly Valued 2 (HV2) will get 10%, down from 20%.

Those dropping from HV3 to HV2 will still receive 20%.

Employees with three straight years of Top Tier will receive 105% of their pay band.

Amazon is changing how it pays employees, focusing more on consistent top performance over time rather than one-time achievements.The new pay structure aims to reward employees who consistently perform at a high level and to reduce bonuses for those with less consistent records.According to an Amazon spokesperson, the new framework ""better distinguishes between newer high performers and those who have consistently exceeded expectations for their role and level.""Starting in 2025, employees who have received the company's highest performance rating, ""Top Tier,"" for four straight years will get 110% of their pay band, up from the previous maximum of 100%, according to internal reports obtained by the Business Insider.However, first-time Top Tier performers will see a drop in their bonus from 80% of their pay range to 70%. Those with two consecutive Top Tier ratings will now receive 90%, slightly down from 100%.According to the internal pay guideline, Amazon wants to create a ""steadier compensation progression.""The changes reflect a broader trend among tech companies like Google and Meta, which are also placing more emphasis on similar performance-based compensation strategies, with stricter review policies and reduced rewards for underperformers.Amazon says it will continue to offer the option for employees to take 25% of their new stock awards as cash, helping those who prefer immediate payouts over long-term stock value.Despite the changes, Amazon claims most employees who improved their performance still saw pay raises this year.Managers are not allowed to share individual Overall Value (OV) ratings with employees, so staff often have to guess their standing based on compensation outcomes. Amazon also said it has “multiple channels” for employees to raise concerns about their pay.","Amazon is changing how it pays employees, focusing more on consistent top performance over time rather than one-time achievements.

India-UK trade deal: Why the new FTA in the series of bilateral FTAs is a joint success of trade & foreign policy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-uk-trade-deal-why-the-new-fta-in-the-series-of-bilateral-ftas-is-a-joint-success-of-trade-foreign-policy/articleshow/121056370.cms,"India-UK FTA: It’s the joint success story of India’s Trade & Foreign Policy. (AI image)

By Himanshu Tewari

(The author is Himanshu Tewari, Partner, Trade and Customs, KPMG in India)

The recent announcement of India UK FTA is new in the series of bilateral FTAs negotiated in the recent past – starting with Australia, followed by UAE and EFTA countries (Norway, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Iceland). It demonstrates a very deliberate and sure-footed approach of expanding India’s FTA footprint for gaining market access for goods of Indian origin and opening new avenues of growth and international cooperation. It’s the joint success story of India’s Trade & Foreign Policy Successful negotiation of the FTA with the UK – till most recently being part of the EU, also bodes well for the progress that India will be able to make with EU FTA negotiations which have been waiting for a decisive push after the past thirteen years of negotiations.India EU FTA has been held back on issues like unconditional market access to European luxury car manufacturers at concessional rate of duty, better access to alco-beverage sector and need for data secure status for India.As is evident from the PIB press release issued on May 6, some of the long standing, contentious issues, which have been holding back the India EU negotiations have been successfully addressed in the India UK FTA.Illustratively progressive reduction in duty rates on import of completely built-up cars from the UK over a period of ten years, subject to the upper limit on the number of cars that can be imported in a year.This quota-based access to luxury or fully built up cars under the FTA is a unique solution which balances out the opposite policy pull of granting market access but without adversely impacting the domestic industry. Simultaneous reduction in duty on cars and implementing annual limits to complete built-up cars is a balanced solution.We have seen this position playing out even in case of reduction in basic customs duty rate on import of superbikes about 1600 cc of engine capacity, or in case of EV policy allowing access to a certain number of complete built up EVs subject to an investment commitment.Also, reduction in duty rates on import of whiskey was another long-standing issue which seems to be resolved not only under India UK FTA but also when India unilaterally announced reduction in the duty rate on Bourbon whiskey of US origin.All these developments are a good omen for a positive outcome in India EU FTA. EU is India’s second largest trading partner and FTA with EU would be a powerful foreign policy win for the government.The initial sound bites on the impact of India UK FTA are very encouraging but fine prints of the agreement are yet to be analyzed. Open questions are how many cars are to be allowed to be imported annually; how will the origin of such cars be established; how would the licensing and control be put in place; whether DGFT will be the nodal agency for granting and monitoring of annual quota; whether the quota will be issued on the name of company. There are many such questions which would require an answer.This newfound flexibility and decisiveness demonstrated by the government in finding win-win solutions to long pending issues is a welcome development which would open the doors of fresh economic activity which could continue to drive growth in GDP and better relationships with partner countries. And the timing of the India UK FTA can’t be better when India is also expecting to close the bilateral trade discussions with the US government. Signing of a series of new FTAs underline the success of India’s foreign policy and trade policy working together.",India uk fta is new in the series of bilateral ftas negotiated in the recent past. It demonstrates a very deliberate and sure-footed approach of expanding india’s fta footprint for gaining market access for goods of indian origin.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New york-based air company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol. Carbon capture and utilization, or ccu, could be an important tool in the fight against climate change. But the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-633411,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
