What a significant growth it is,” he noted.Narayanan, who is also the secretary of the department of space, was conferred the honorary Doctor of Science degree by Maharashtra governor C P Radhakrishnan during the 21st Convocation of the SRM Institute of Science and Technology at Kattankulathur, near Chennai.Recalling Isro’s beginnings, he said the agency was set up in 1963 when India lagged six to seven years behind advanced nations. That year, the United States donated a small rocket to India, marking the start of the country’s space programme.“It was on November 21, 1963,” he said.Narayanan also pointed to 1975, when Isro demonstrated ‘mass communication’ with the help of US satellite data by installing 2,400 television sets across 2,400 villages in six Indian states.Reflecting on recent achievements, he called July 30 “a historical day for Indian space programme” when Isro launched the world’s costliest satellite, NISAR, carrying the L Band SAR payload from the US and the S Band payload from Isro.“The satellite was placed in orbit precisely by Indian launcher (GSLV). And today, we are shoulder to shoulder with advanced countries,” he said.He added that Nasa’s team had praised Isro for the precision of the GSLV-F16/NISAR mission. Highlighting India’s rise in the global space sector, Narayanan said that from having no satellite technology 50 years ago, Isro has now launched 433 satellites for 34 countries using its own launch vehicles.","In the next couple of months, isro will be launching a 6,500 kg communication satellite built by the us.

The satellite will provide direct-to-smartphone broadband connectivity, eliminating the need for specialised terminals.The next-generation American satellite is expected to reach India in Sept and will be launched aboard LVM-3-M5, Isro's heaviest rocket, from the Sriharikota spaceport. BlueBird satellite uses AST & Science's patented technologies for connecting to cellphones in a space environment for their SpaceMobile constellation.The satellite has a communications array measuring 64.38 sq m to establish direct connectivity with cellphones via 3GPP-standard frequencies, in partnership with leading cellular service providers around the world. After NISAR, the Block-2 BlueBird launch will further boost Indo-US space collaboration.Narayanan, who was presented with an honorary Doctor of Science degree by Maharashtra governor C.P.

'Global-first' Indian-origin AI startups rake in moolah,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/global-first-indian-origin-ai-startups-rake-in-moolah/articleshow/123223486.cms,"Representative AI image

BENGALURU: A clutch of India-origin AI startups secured significant early-stage funding, attracting marquee global investors. With a global-first approach, these homegrown startups demonstrated early monetisation potential and commanded premium valuations, reflecting growing confidence in their scalability and global relevance. These AI-native startup deals that TOI learnt about include Y Combinator-backed GigaML, which offers secure on-premise deployment of large language models for enterprise use cases. At a stage of $1-3 million annual recurring revenue (ARR), it raised $40 million led by US-based Redpoint Ventures at a $350 million post-money valuation. Atomicwork, an AI-native alternative to traditional enterprise service desks, secured $25 million in a round that saw participation from Khosla Ventures at a $120 million valuation, while it was operating at $1.2 million ARR.Both Redpoint Ventures and Khosla Ventures have a track record of backing some of the most prominent technology companies globally. Other transactions TOI learnt about include Y Combinator-backed Emergent, which raised $20 million led by Lightspeed India at a $90 million valuation. It was operating at $2.5 million ARR. Operating at an ARR of $4-5 million, UnifyApps secured $50 million from WestBridge Capital at a $250 million valuation.Operating at an ARR of $1 million, Confido Health raised $9.3 million from investors such as Blume Ventures and DeVc at a $35 million valuation. At a scale of $400,000 ARR, Composio raised $25 million in a round led by Lightspeed India at a $120 million valuation. Metaforms, at a scale of $1 million, raised $10 million led by Peak XV Partners at a valuation of $50 million. Meanwhile, Weaver AI, at a pre-revenue stage and founded by serial entrepreneur Kushagra Sinha, raised $10-12 million led by First Round Capital at a $70 million valuation. First Round Capital's global portfolio comprises the likes of Notion, Roblox, Square and Uber. All these native AI deals are India-origin businesses adopting a global-first go-to-market approach.Many already have paying customers despite their early stage, a critical factor in the sector currently. Manav Garg, co-founder and managing partner at Together Fund, an early investor in some of these native AI startups, declined to comment on deal specifics but said valuations in Indian AI startups are starting to mirror global enthusiasm. “Revenue multiples globally for AI-first startups can range from 10X to 50X ARR, especially for frontier tech or infra players. Indian valuations are now catching up,” he said. According to Garg, multiples are driven by factors such as “narrative premium” when a startup aligns with global AI tailwinds, differentiated intellectual property, and revenue quality. Beyond ARR, he said investors look for indicators like quality of usage, proprietary data loops, and speed to productisation.Global AI-native startups in more mature ecosystems have shown a pattern of rapid growth, attracting substantial capital with high valuations, strong revenue traction and distinct product positioning in the AI ecosystem. Thinking Machines Lab, founded by former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati, recently raised about $2 billion in a seed funding round led by Andreessen Horowitz, reaching a valuation of $12 billion. Cursor, developed by Anysphere, is another high-profile AI startup listed among the fastest-growing SaaS companies. It generated $100 million in revenue in 2024 and is on track to double that to $200 million in 2025. It was valued at $2.6 billion following a $105 million Series B round led by Thrive Capital. Native AI founders are leveraging a targeted vertical strategy to create defensible positions. Akshay Tyagi, founder and CEO of Metaforms, said the company is using the $10 million raised to set up an engineering and sales office in New York and transition from a point solution to a full-stack operating system for market research agencies. “We compete in a blue ocean. This targeted vertical has helped us build AI automation from first principles in an industry that typically doesn’t buy software. We’ve been able to crack access to this traditional market, creating a virtual monopoly as a tech provider to research firms,” he said.Garg expects “a Cambrian explosion” in the sector over the next 3-5 years, with startup formation tripling as Gen Z founders build AI-native workflows, more deeptech ventures targeting infrastructure and agentic AI, and India producing globally competitive AI products. But he cautioned that after valuation spikes, challenges such as converting early usage into paid adoption, maintaining differentiation as large language models commoditise and hiring specialised talent remain significant.","Gigaml raised $40 million led by us-based redpoint ventures at $350 million post-money valuation. Atomicwork, an ai-native alternative to traditional enterprise service desks, secured $25 million in a round that saw participation from khosla ventures at a $120 million valuation.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123223509,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-196523,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

From Taylor Swift's inner circle to ghosted contact

Where Travis Kelce fits into the buzz

For years, Taylor Swift and Blake Lively were one of Hollywood’s most unexpected yet adored celebrity friendships — from cozy holiday hangouts to glitzy red carpet moments. But according to new reports, things may have turned sour between the pop superstar and the Gossip Girl alum, and insiders claim Lively is bracing herself for the ultimate Swiftian fallout: becoming the subject of a song.Per Rob Shuter’s #ShuterScoop, a source alleges, “Taylor’s been distancing herself since the legal stuff started blowing up.” Lively, who has been involved in a legal dispute with her It Ends with Us co-star Justin Baldoni, is reportedly “terrified she’ll be the subject of a song… and not the flattering kind.”Another insider painted a starker picture, claiming the actress “went from being Taylor’s inner-circle icon to a ghosted contact” — adding the ominous warning, “And with Taylor, when you’re out… you’re a verse away from being dragged.”A mutual friend reportedly quipped that Lively is “smart enough to know the lyrics before they drop” and fears “they might rhyme with betrayal.” While neither Swift nor Lively has addressed the speculation publicly, their absence from each other’s recent public appearances hasn’t gone unnoticed by fans.As Swift’s romance with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce continues to dominate headlines, some fans have connected the dots between her personal relationships and her songwriting.Swift has a long history of drawing on her real-life experiences in music, and with Kelce now a major part of her public image, even her platonic friendships are getting pulled into the narrative.Social media debates suggest that Swift’s fiercely protective fanbase — and her high-profile romance — could intensify the fallout if Lively does end up in a lyric. Kelce, though uninvolved in the alleged rift, is seen by some as part of the “Taylor bubble” that defines who’s in or out of her close-knit world.Also Read: “Karma is a relaxing thought”: Swifties celebrate C.J.

Elon Musk’s xAI has introduced Grok Imagine , a powerful new feature in its Grok AI platform that allows users to generate images and short video clips from simple text prompts. What’s making headlines, however, is its controversial “Spicy Mode” — a setting that reportedly enables the creation of NSFW (Not Safe For Work) content, sparking concerns about potential misuse, content moderation, and digital safety.This bold move places xAI in direct competition with major players, intensifying the race to dominate the multimedia generative AI space.

By integrating multi-modal AI capabilities into a single user-friendly interface, Grok Imagine streamlines the creative process for users looking to produce custom visuals — from standard artwork to more experimental outputs.This mirrors recent industry developments like Midjourney’s new video-generation feature, showing that AI content generation is expanding rapidly beyond static imagery.The app generates a short video with audio.Grok Imagine is currently accessible through the Grok iOS app for Heavy and Premium+ subscribers, and for Heavy tier users on Android. The rollout aligns with xAI’s strategy to reserve advanced features for paid tiers, mirroring the premium access model used by other generative platforms.One of the most talked-about additions to Grok Imagine is its “Spicy Mode”, which, according to a report by TechCrunch, enables users to generate content that includes partial nudity and sexually suggestive visuals.Despite this, the app enforces content moderation. Users trying to push boundaries often receive blurred or blocked results. However, some semi-nude imagery has reportedly been generated during tests — raising questions about ethical AI boundaries and content safety.Grok Imagine competes directly with top AI tools like:Each platform has its strengths, but Grok Imagine’s inclusion of voice mode, video synthesis, and “Spicy Mode” sets it apart in terms of versatility and boldness.With Grok Imagine, xAI has added another innovative tool to the fast-growing AI ecosystem.

This downtime is expected to end before the release of the Shock 'N Awesome update, which has rendered the game unplayable for players across the world. The upcoming update will focus on a mechanical insectoid bug invasion and will even feature a collaboration with the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers. The new season's narrative centres around a bug invasion originating from the Kraken, which was summoned by the character Daigo.Players are waiting to jump into the latest content as soon as the scheduled downtime concludes.

Once a Fortnite season concludes, servers usually remain offline for about two to five hours before the next season becomes accessible.However, it can take much longer, like the 18-hour downtime before Chapter 5, Season 2. If things go smoothly, the servers will be back within the next few hours.Epic Games has announced that Fortnite’s v37.00 update is one of the most substantial seasonal updates so far, potentially requiring longer-than-usual downtime.

New mobility-focused gameplay mechanics and Power Rangers-inspired Battle Pass items are expected. Technical upgrades and quality-of-life improvements will also roll out gradually after the v37.00 update.The patch also brings various bug fixes across Fortnite modes, including Battle Royale, LEGO Fortnite, Rocket Racing, and Save the World. Notable fixes include locker UI glitches, mobile control issues, and model display problems. These changes are based on player feedback and aim to improve performance and usability.","When will fortnite servers come back in us, uk, europe and other countries?

Bezos-Sánchez wedding draws criticism over DiCaprio’s jet travel



Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez’s $40 Venetian wedding

Newlyweds Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez were recently spotted hosting Leonardo DiCaprio and his model girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti aboard their $485 million superyacht Koru . The high-profile outing took place off the coast of Ibiza, a popular celebrity hotspot and luxury summer getaway destination. Leonardo DiCaprio, known for his understated style, wore a plain white T-shirt, shorts, and his trademark baseball cap and sunglasses. Vittoria Ceretti showcased her model figure in a strapless blue top and black yoga pants. Bezos opted for tropical-printed swim trunks paired with a navy T-shirt, while Sánchez layered a printed kimono over a bikini. Their casual vacation looks perfectly captured the relaxed yet exclusive atmosphere aboard one of the world’s most extravagant and expensive private yachts, making headlines among luxury lifestyle and celebrity news followers worldwide.Bezos’s superyacht Koru, meaning “new beginnings” in Māori, represents the couple’s extravagant lifestyle and new chapter together. Built by Dutch shipbuilder Oceanco, Koru stands as the world’s tallest sailing yacht, measuring 250 feet tall with three masts exceeding 230 feet each.At 416 feet wide, the yacht features three luxury decks, multiple lounges, and ultra-modern amenities. Its construction spanned five years, costing an estimated $485 million. The yacht previously sparked controversy when plans to dismantle a historic Rotterdam bridge emerged to allow Koru’s passage, leading to widespread public protests and alternative solutions by the builders.Leonardo DiCaprio’s attendance at Bezos and Sánchez’s Venetian wedding drew backlash, with critics calling him a “hypocrite” due to his outspoken environmental activism. Social media users highlighted the contradiction between DiCaprio’s climate advocacy and the carbon-heavy nature of celebrity private jet travel, pointing out that over 90 jets reportedly flew into Venice for the wedding.Despite the criticism, DiCaprio’s friendship with Bezos remains strong, as evidenced by their repeat vacations together including last year’s luxury yacht trip in Sardinia. One of the wedding’s most surprising attendees was Sydney Sweeney, who reportedly had no close personal connection to Bezos or Sánchez. Later reports revealed that Bezos and Sánchez are investing in Sweeney’s upcoming lingerie line, explaining her presence at the event. This move demonstrates how the Bezos-Sánchez social circle extends beyond personal relationships to professional collaborations, further solidifying their influence in both business and Hollywood circles.The Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases a blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances. Whether it’s a $40 million Venetian wedding, a $485 million yacht, or investments in rising Hollywood talent, the couple has firmly positioned themselves at the center of celebrity culture and high society.Just weeks before their Ibiza yacht trip, Bezos and Sánchez tied the knot in an opulent $40 million wedding in Venice. The three-day celebration attracted global headlines not just for its extravagance but also for the massive celebrity turnout, including Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom, and Sydney Sweeney.Despite public protests in Venice over the event’s scale, insiders revealed that the wedding was surprisingly intimate. No non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) were required for guests, allowing attendees to freely share their experiences. The bride’s $5 million diamond ring became a symbol of the wedding’s lavishness and continues to be a topic of discussion among jewelers and fans alike.","Jeff bezos and lauren sánchez hosted leonardo dicaprio and his model girlfriend vittoria ceretti aboard their $485 million superyacht koru.

WASHINGTON: From holding back investments to considering moving abroad, businesses in the United States are bracing for more economic turbulence as the presidential campaign kicks into high gear -- with fresh tariffs rolled out and promises of more.Republican candidate Donald Trump has proposed at least a 10 percent tariff on imports and up to 60 percent on Chinese goods, intensifying levies he previously imposed on Beijing and others.Democratic nominee Kamala Harris , meanwhile, serves an administration that largely maintained Trump's tariffs and last month finalized further hikes on $18 billion of Chinese products.For Robert Actis, whose manufacturing business has been caught in the tariff maelstrom, the future has looked ""clouded"" over the past five years.Under Trump, he faced tariffs on steel and aluminum and has struggled to find alternative suppliers for raw materials not produced in the country.Fresh measures on the materials by the Biden-Harris administration have added to his woes.""I would be very happy to buy from a US producer,"" said Actis, who imports wires to make stucco netting used in construction, ""but there's no one willing to do it.""He has previously been granted tariff exemptions, but the annual applications are not always successful.Additional costs are gradually being passed to homebuilders, he said.- Millions in costs -US tariffs weigh on many industries. The American Apparel & Footwear Association (AAFA) estimates retail prices have risen five percent to 10 percent annually since 2020.""Initially, our members tried to eat some of those costs by eating into their profits,"" said Nate Herman, AAFA's senior vice president for policy.But this has been tough.It is unclear that tariffs on China have returned production to the United States, as Trump argues, and at least 14 US textile mills have closed in recent years, Herman told AFP.Products like certain acrylic sweaters are not produced domestically either, requiring new machinery and trained workers, he said.""The average age in domestic factories has gone into the 50s because we just can't find workers willing to work in those factories,"" Herman added.""For a small company like us, it's millions of dollars"" in added costs, said Ray Sharrah, CEO of lighting products maker Streamlight.""We pay for it, our exporter helps, and ultimately the consumer (pays),"" he said. ""This is the problem with any tariff.""- 'Dampening effect' -Uncertainty looms as November's election approaches, but businesses prefer predicability.A September survey involving the Richmond and Atlanta Federal Reserve banks found that 30 percent of firms reported postponing, scaling down, delaying or canceling investment plans due to election uncertainty.""It stops you from action. It stops you from investment, and it just generally creates a dampening effect on all economic development,"" Sharrah said.With business partners, he has been trying to bring production of a major component back into the country -- but to no avail.""When we spend time reshuffling the supply chain deck, that's time we don't spend growing our business,"" he said.AAFA's Herman added that companies have been trying to find alternative sources but ""with mixed results.""He believes businesses will ramp up imports ahead of expected tariff hikes, as happened in 2018 when Trump engaged in a trade war with Beijing.""But again, if there's a global tariff imposed, then where do you go?"" Herman said.- Rhetoric or reality? -Businesses expect tariffs to stay no matter who wins the election.""If anything, it's probably going to go up,"" Actis said, adding that he has considered moving his business abroad.But he believes it is hard to predict what a candidate like Trump might do, saying, ""A lot of it is bombast.""Will Thomas of Colonial Metal Products said there is little businesses can do besides importing from diverse sources.""It seems that the presidential candidates want to say things that invoke emotion,"" he said.""However, if all these products aren't there, and you keep increasing the cost of the products, what happens? The costs go up, it's inflation.""At auto accessories importer Trim Illusion, President Colby McLaughlin is considering scaling up his business to boost margins.As a voter, he is torn between perspectives as a business owner and a citizen.""I'm not against a tariff, as long as there is a plan or support to help these companies bring the manufacturing back,"" he said.""For me, that's the piece that I haven't heard.""",Us firms brace for more tariffs as election approaches and promises of more. Donald trump has proposed at least a 10 percent tariff on imports and up to 60 percent on chinese goods.

Demis Hassabis , Britain’s recent Nobel Prize winner in Chemistry, has a remarkable background that bridges the worlds of video games and artificial intelligence . Unlike most teenagers, who typically spend their time playing video games, Hassabis spent his formative years developing them. His big break came in 1994 when he co-designed the hit game Theme Park , a simulation where players manage amusement parks.Born in London to a Greek Cypriot father and a Singaporean mother, Hassabis excelled academically. He earned a double first in computer science from Cambridge University, later launching his own video game company. His intellectual curiosity led him to pursue a PhD in cognitive neuroscience , which became a stepping stone to co-founding the AI startup DeepMind . This venture was eventually acquired by Google for £400 million in 2014.Now 48 years old, Hassabis holds the position of Chief Executive at Google DeepMind, the company’s advanced AI unit. He was knighted in 2023 for his services to artificial intelligence, and his work has culminated in the Nobel Prize, which he shares with colleague John Jumper and US academic David Baker. Their award stems from groundbreaking work in using AI to predict and design the structure of proteins, a significant achievement in both the scientific and AI communities.Hassabis has long emphasised the connection between gaming and artificial intelligence, describing games as an entryway to the world of AI. His early passion for chess, coupled with a fascination for chess computers, sparked ideas about how machines learn, which would later influence his pioneering work in AI. His startup, DeepMind, achieved global recognition by building AI systems that outperformed humans in complex games like Go, chess, and Starcraft II.Beyond gaming and research, Hassabis’s expertise is highly valued by governments and thought leaders. In 2020, he was called upon to provide advice to the UK government’s Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies during the Covid-19 pandemic. His reputation as a forward-thinking AI expert led figures like Dominic Cummings and Tony Blair to seek his counsel on national and global matters.As a leader in Google’s AI research, Hassabis is at the forefront of the global AI race, with major US tech companies such as Google, Meta, OpenAI, and Microsoft competing for breakthroughs. While deeply involved in advancing AI technologies, Hassabis is acutely aware of the risks. In recent years, he has voiced concern over the potential dangers of AI, likening its risks to those of pandemics and nuclear war. In 2023, he signed a statement urging global leaders to treat the threat of uncontrolled AI systems as seriously as they treat other existential challenges, such as climate change.However, Hassabis remains optimistic about AI’s potential for good. The Nobel Prize itself is a testament to this, particularly his work with AlphaFold, an AI system that accurately predicts protein structures . This development has far-reaching implications for medical research and drug development, showcasing the profound ways in which AI can benefit society.Despite his caution regarding AI's dangers, Hassabis continues to champion its capacity to address complex global problems. His leadership in both AI innovation and ethical considerations ensures that he will remain a key figure in the future of technology.","Demis hassabis was knighted in 2023 for his services to artificial intelligence.

Chinese hackers breached US court wiretap systems: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinese-hackers-breached-us-court-wiretap-systems-report/articleshow/113996372.cms,"Chinese hackers accessed the networks of US broadband providers and obtained information from systems the federal govt uses for court-authorised wiretapping, the Wall Street Journal reported on Saturday. Verizon Communications , AT&T and Lumen Technologies are among the telecoms companies whose networks were breached by the recently discovered intrusion, the newspaper said, citing people familiar with the matter.The hackers might have held access for months to network infrastructure used by the companies to cooperate with court-authorised US requests for communications data, the Journal said. It said the hackers had also accessed other tranches of internet traffic.China's foreign ministry responded on Sunday that it was not aware of the attack described in the report but said the US had ""concocted a false narrative"" to ""frame"" China in the past. ""At a time when cybersecurity has become a common challenge for all countries around the world, this erroneous approach will only hinder the efforts of the international community to jointly address the challenge through dialogue and cooperation,"" the ministry said in a statement to Reuters.Beijing has previously denied claims by the US govt and others that it has used hackers to break into foreign computer systems.Lumen Technologies declined to comment, while Verizon and AT&T did not immediately respond to requests for comment. The Journal said the attack was carried out by a Chinese hacking group with the aim of collecting intelligence.

Here's how much ransom amount Star Health hacker demanded,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/heres-how-much-ransom-amount-star-health-hacker-demanded/articleshow/114178127.cms,"How the hacker stole Star Health’s data



Star Health , the largest health insurer in the country, was hit with a data breach that exposed sensitive customer information, including medical records and tax details. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the company has now revealed that the hacker responsible for the leak demanded a $68,000 (nearly 57.21 lakhs) ransom in August. The company noted that ""the threat actor demanded a ransom of $68,000 in an email"" addressed to its managing director and chief executive.The breach, which was first reported in September, has led to a reputational and business crisis for the company. Star Health’s shares have since declined by 11%. The company launched internal investigations and has also taken legal action against the messaging app Telegram and the hacker. The report claims that the hacker’s website continues to share samples of Star customers' data.This statement comes after stock exchanges asked Star Health for clarification over another Reuters report which claimed that the company was investigating allegations about its chief security officer being involved in the data leak.Later on, the company announced that it had found no wrongdoing by the official, Amarjeet Khanuja. However, the internal investigation stays open.The hacker exploited Telegram chatbots and a dedicated website to disseminate the stolen data and continues to share samples of customer information. In response to the breach, Star Health launched internal investigations and initiated legal action against Telegram and the hacker. The company is also collaborating with Indian cyber security authorities to address the situation.Despite receiving multiple notices from the insurance company, Telegram has refused to share information about the hacker's accounts or permanently ban them from the platform, Star Health said. The company also identified the hacker as ""xenZen"" in their latest statement.However, earlier, the Dubai-based messenger app said that it removed the chatbots as soon as it was flagged to the platform.","Star health was hit with a data breach that exposed sensitive customer information.

"Roblox dismisses claims made by Hindenburg report: ""...don't support their agenda""",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/gaming/roblox-dismisses-claims-made-by-hindenburg-report-dont-support-their-agenda/articleshow/114178326.cms,"Read Roblox’s statement here



“Roblox rejects the claims made in the Hindenburg Report.

Safety and civility have been foundational to Roblox since the company’s inception nearly two decades ago, and the company has invested heavily throughout its history in its Trust & Safety efforts. Every day, tens of millions of users of all ages have safe and positive experiences on Roblox, abiding by the company’s Community Standards. Roblox takes any content or behaviour on the platform that doesn’t abide by its standards extremely seriously, and Roblox has a robust set of proactive and preventative safety measures designed to catch and prevent malicious or harmful activity on the platform. For more information about Roblox’s safety efforts, see this most recent blog post.

The financial claims made by Hindenburg are misleading. The authors are short sellers and have an agenda irrespective of the substance of Roblox’s business model and results. Roblox’s topline is growing quickly. Bookings grew over 22% to $955.2 million in Q2 2024 (the most recent publicly reported quarter) up from $780.7 million in Q2 2023. Over the last four quarters, cash provided by operating activities has totaled $646.3 million and free cash flow was $440.3 million. An examination of Roblox's GAAP balance sheet and GAAP cash flow statement makes that clear. The focus on cash bookings and cash flow are themes that the company has focused on consistently with investors dating back to when it was a private company. The authors made no attempt to highlight any of that because the positive facts simply don’t support their agenda.

The authors neglected to accurately report on the company’s public disclosures. Roblox takes its reporting obligations seriously. Since Roblox’s initial public filing, the company has included a Special Note Regarding Operating Metrics that explains how the company’s key operating metrics (including DAUs, hours, and bookings) are calculated. As an example, below is selected language from the company’s most recent 10-K regarding Daily Active Users (emphasis added):

‘We define a DAU as a user who has logged in and visited Roblox through our website or application on a unique registered account on a given calendar day. If a registered, logged-in user visits Roblox more than once within a 24-hour period that spans two calendar days, that user is counted as a DAU only for the first calendar day. We believe this method better reflects global engagement on the platform compared to a method based purely on a calendar-day cutoff. DAUs for a specified period are the average of the DAUs for each day during that period. As an example, DAUs for the month of September would be an average of DAUs during that 30-day period.

Because DAUs measure account activity and an individual user may actively use our platform within a particular day on multiple accounts for which that individual registered, our DAUs are not a measure of unique individuals accessing Roblox. Additionally, if undetected, fraud and unauthorized access to our platform may contribute, from time to time, to an overstatement of DAUs. In many cases, fraudulent accounts are created by bots to inflate user activity for a particular developer’s content on our platform, thus making the developer’s experience (which refer to the titles that have been created by developers) or other content appear more popular than it really is. We strive to detect and minimize fraud and unauthorized access to our platform.’

There is additional detail in the company’s filings on hours, bookings and other metrics that provide abundant clarity on the company’s approaches to measuring and reporting these critical metrics. Roblox looks forward to discussing its most recent financial results and answering any questions on the company’s third-quarter earnings call on October 31, 2024.”

Roblox, the popular online gaming platform, has dismissed the allegations presented in a recent report by Hindenburg Research , a firm known for its activist short-selling. In a statement, Roblox rejected the claims outright, accusing Hindenburg of misrepresenting key aspects of its business and having a vested interest in driving the company's stock price down. The gaming platform specifically addressed the report's financial claims, labelling them ""misleading"" and emphasising its strong revenue growth and positive cash flow. Roblox also highlighted its commitment to user safety, a point of contention in the Hindenburg report , and reiterated its dedication to providing a secure and positive experience for its users.Earlier this week, a Hindenburg report accused Roblox of inflating its user count by as much as 42% and misleading investors. The report claimed that the game intentionally includes alternate accounts and bots in its user metrics, despite having the ability to distinguish them. Hindenburg also raised concerns about child safety on the platform, citing examples of young users being exposed to explicit content.In an official statement, Roblox wrote:","Roblox has a robust set of proactive and. Prevent malicious or harmful on the platform. Every day, tens of millions of users of all ages have safe and positive experiences on roblox. The authors neglected to highlight any of that because the positive facts simply don't support their agenda.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-114178319,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-31336,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

'Europe has lot of opportunities',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/europe-has-lot-of-opportunities/articleshow/123223547.cms,"How will the tariffs impact your business?

How do you address this challenge?

What is the demand

outlook?

What happens if the trade talks with the US don't yield results?

Bharat Forge has a large US exposure and is in talks with American buyers after import duties were slapped on Indian exports. While it is hopeful of the issue getting resolved, it will eye opportunities in Europe if there is no resolution, the company's vice-chairman and joint MD Amit Kalyani tells TOI. Excerpts:The US auto sector accounts for about 35-40% of our sales. Over the years, because of our defence businesses and other businesses in the EU, we have reduced our share of the US and reduced the risk, but it still remains a very important market. We have very strong and entrenched relations with our customers in the US as we have been supplying them for 30 years. We need to work with the customers on how we navigate this challenge. Everyone understands the push & pull and we will work jointly with customers.In the near term, there will be some demand issues due to the overhang of tariffs but we don't know if it will exacerbate or get resolved; no one knows the impact on profit and demand. When it comes to Indian exports to the US, the larger sectors in the non-IT and non-pharma space, such as textiles and garments, shoes, gems & jewellery-which are extremely fragmented-and large employers will have bigger and faster impact.These are also sectors which are very price sensitive.The challenge can also be a growth opportunity. After all, India has the ambition to grow and create opportunities for the 1.4 billion citizens of the country. We need to accelerate the pace of employment in the long run. There is a risk in the short to medium term.But India and the US are not enemies and issues should get resolved, otherwise India has to look at other opportunities, which may take time. The greatest opportunity would be to look at building infrastructure at a faster pace and speed up large capital expenditure, which will also create jobs and make India more competitive.As a business, we always deal with issues that are within our control and as a country too we need to do that.The first quarter has been weak and the second quarter will be similar. It will also depend on the impact (of tariffs) and how things play out over the next 10-15 days. We expect the second half to be better.There are a lot of opportunities in Europe... FTAs are a good starting point for engagement.","Bharat forge has a large us exposure and is in talks with american buyers.
