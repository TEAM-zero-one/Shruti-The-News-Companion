You have spent a year with the current portfolios in the current Modi dispensation. There was focus on the North-East. How do you view the progress during your tenure in the ministry?

How far have you expanded the 5G coverage?

BSNL is seen as the next Air India. What is being done to ensure that it remains financially viable and a relevant player in the market?

You spoke about avoiding duopolies…

Vodafone Idea is very fragile. Is there a plan for fresh support?

You have a plan to make the postal department a profit centre. Is it really possible?

How do you take on competition from couriers?

Is there a plan to monetise prime real estate?

What is the department doing to improve the telecom services?

■ PM has identified the North-East as the area with maximum focus. Since Independence, it was consistently neglected. PM has changed the paradigm and decided to make the North-East the growth engine of our development paradigm. Over the last 11 years, he has himself visited the North-East more than 70 times, which is more than all PMs together in the previous 65 years. He has ensured that the Cabinet continuously keeps in touch with the grassroots of the NorthEast. Cabinet ministers have visited the NorthEast over 700 times. Around Rs 5 lakh crore is being invested in plug and play infrastructure. There is a massive build-up in road, railway and airport infrastructure. Private companies are putting in investment. At the NorthEast Investment Summit, they committed to invest Rs 4.2 lakh crore, and I am not counting investments such as the Rs 27,000 crore for a semiconductor facility being set up by the Tata Group in Assam.■ There has been a phenomenal change. PM had the foresight and capability to not only assess the revolution that was coming but also ensure that India leads it. It is evident from the rise in subscribers, the cost has come down for consumers.India can become the data capital of the world. We have the fastest 5G rollout with 99.6% of the districts now covered and 82% population. We have built our own 4G stack. BSNL has installed 94,500 towers and 80-85% are commissioned. We are working towards leading the world on 6G.■ After 18 years BSNL has done a turnaround, posting a quarterly profit for the first time since 2007. In the Dec quarter, it posted a profit of Rs 262 crore and in the March quarter, the profit was Rs 280 crore. For the full year, losses have come down 55% to Rs 2,415 crores; operating profit has more than doubled to Rs 5,395 crore. It has done the largest capex, of Rs 25,000 crore in FY25, which will be amortized over 10 years. It has rolled out 4G. We have grown our customer base, focusing on all areas and all segments.■ India is not a duopoly. We are the only few markets in the world with four players. My responsibility as the minister is to ensure that customers have choice, whether it’s internet or telecom.■ There will be no more conversion of equity. It’s the company’s management to look at their business strategy, profitability, just as the BSNL management.■ We have undertaken a business process reengineering and converted the department into six verticals and four horizontals looking at mail, international mail, parcels, Postal Life Insurance, post office savings bank and citizen centric services. Every transaction now has a cost structure and we are mapping the revenue. We are looking at six strategic business units with profit and loss for each. We are then determining the path to profitability for each of them. We are working on IT 2.0 and for the first time we have hired a chief technology officer with deputy CTOs for each vertical. I look at it turning into a logistics organization with a huge reach of 1.6 lakh crore post offices. The restructuring and capex by govt will hopefully turn it into a profit centre in five years. Today, our cost structure is Rs 27,000 crore and revenue is around Rs 12,000 crore.■ No one has the breadth and depth of India Post, even internationally. The point is how much can you push through this pipe and increase different products. We are now providing governmental services such as Aadhaar and passport. We are bringing new mail and parcel products; we will deliver within 24 hours. We are approaching mutual funds to distribute their products. There must be a mindset change and for that I am meeting the ground level staff.■ Whether it’s telecom or department of posts, we must sweat our assets. Therefore, if you have a large piece of land, you can have the post office on the ground floor and build the whole building and lease out space. First thing we are doing is understanding how many properties do we have, we are checking where are the title papers, the mutation details and identifying the major potential properties before we get a developer.■ Improving the quality of service (QoS) is one of my top priorities. Trai monitors performance, issues showcause notices, and imposes penalties for non-compliance. New regulations introduced in Aug mandate Six Sigma practices and graded penalties for repeated lapses. In coordination with service providers, new sites are being added and existing infrastructure upgraded to boost internet speed and reduce congestion.","Jyotiraditya scindia has spent a year with the current portfolios in the current modi dispensation.

"Amid import fears, govt to review protection for homegrown apples",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/amid-import-fears-govt-to-review-protection-for-homegrown-apples/articleshow/122284319.cms,"SRINAGAR: Amid fears of rising imports, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal on Sunday said govt will review protection for homegrown apples, while underlining the need to strike a balance between the interests of growers and the needs of consumers.The minister's comment at a meeting with trade and industry here came amid demands from the US to lower tariffs on apples and other farm goods as part of the early tranche of a bilateral trade deal. India has expressed its reluctance to lower import duty on agricultural products while controlling the entry of genetically modified maize and soybean.Goyal said govt has prescribed a minimum import price of Rs 50 a kg and there is also a 25% import duty, translating into a protection of around Rs 75 a kg and a selling price of at least Rs 125-150 a kg. With domestic prices linked to the cost of imported goods, Goyal argued that a sharp increase in protection will raise retail prices further, making them unattractive to consumers and hurting overall demand.""To give the taste of Kashmir apples to the country, price has to be affordable. We need to balance between the interests of producers and consumers. We will see if MIP and other protection can be increased,"" he said.With production not keeping pace with growing demand, India imports 4.5-5 lakh tonne of apple, with Turkiye being among the largest sources. The US is seeking to topple Turkiye by seeking preferential duty access.Goyal told local businessmen govt was making efforts to step up exports of Indian goods through free trade agreements. While asserting that the Modi govt kept the country's interests paramount, he also said trade liberalisation cannot be a one-way street and as part of trade deals, both countries needed to open markets.He said the new rail link from Kashmir will help move goods faster to the rest of the country and assured businesses that development work will be pushed by the Centre.Noting that the Pahalgam terror attack was meant to hurt tourism and the economy in Kashmir, the minister said that business is returning to normal and tourist flow has also increased.",Commerce and industry minister piyush goyal said govt will review protection for homegrown apples.

The New Balance moment that made fans think he’s done with Nike



“Nike letting just anybody slip away… New Balance it is 💰😮‍💨”

“Wondering how many in Bills Mafia will switch to New Balance.”

So why New Balance? Fans have theories and jokes

Josh Allen just stepped into something new, literally. The Buffalo Bills’ golden boy was spotted rocking New Balance sneakers, and the internet instantly lost its grip. No flashy Nike logo. No loud rollout. Just Josh, a chilled-out tee, black shorts, and dad shoes that scream, “Yeah, I’m comfy—and what about it?”Now, people are scrambling to figure out what it means. Is he officially leaving Nike? Is New Balance gearing up to sign their biggest NFL name yet? Or did Josh Allen just decide that 2025 is the year of orthopedic drip?The viral photo, showed Allen walking away from his car wearing New Balance sneakers. The caption said it all:And that’s not just a throwaway comment, Josh Allen was previously signed to Nike in a multi-year endorsement deal starting back in 2021. But now? There’s no Swoosh in sight.Another fan chimed in with the realest question of them all:While there’s no official New Balance endorsement announcement (yet), fans are already piecing it together. New Balance has been on a hot streak lately, lacing up stars like Kawhi Leonard and Coco Gauff. Now, if Josh Allen joins that club? It’s a major flex for the brand that used to scream suburban dad energy and now screams elite athlete with chill confidence.This isn’t just a sneaker swap. It’s a full-on vibe shift. While some QBs go all-in on flashy fits and loud branding, Allen is taking the low-key route: subtle flexes, casual power moves, and now, New Balance.It’s the same energy we’re seeing from guys like Joe Burrow (with his Midwest monotone drip) and Jalen Hurts (who walks into pressers like it’s business class). Josh Allen isn’t out here chasing clout, he’s building a brand of his own. And it starts with walking away from Nike like it was no big deal.If this is a breakup with Nike, it’s the quietest mic drop of the offseason. Josh Allen didn’t need a flashy announcement. He just wore what he wanted and let the internet do the talking. Whether it turns into an official endorsement or not, one thing is clear: New Balance just got a major upgrade. And Josh? He’s clearly in his “I do what I want” era and the shoes match perfectly.Also read - Was Yung Miami warning Cardi B the whole time?

Pirate Software claims being made “the villain” boosted petition’s momentum as Stop Killing Games hits 1 million signatures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/news/pirate-software-claims-being-made-the-villain-boosted-petitions-momentum-as-stop-killing-games-hits-1-million-signatures/articleshow/122247174.cms,"(Image via YouTube/Pirate Software)

Pirate Software claims the villain narrative ignited support in the Stop Killing Games favour



""My videos do not seem to have had any impact on the movement at all.” “Making me the villain did, though,""

How did fans react to Pirate Software not being a villain narrative?



""We need pple like you pirate,”

“speaking about it as a dev from a dev PoV and simply almost no gamer could relate…”

“Sure…”

“Just stop man , just stop killing games.”

“People love drama and they love having a villain to hate.”

“People just look for a scapegoat when their stupid things start failing.”

Stop Killing Games is not an easy fight.



The Stop Killing Games petition has now surged past a million signatures, but there’s an unexpected twist. It’s not just about the milestone. Jason “Thor” Hall, popularly known as Pirate Software, the vocal critic of this moment, claims that social media backlash against him painted him as an antagonist, but truly, that turbocharged the momentum of the SKG movement. Such a counter-intuitive argument added a dramatic layer to the fight to preserve access to the purchased games.Pirate Software has directly countered the claims that his critical analysis video damaged the SKG petition. He presented some data and suggested that interest was already waning before he commented on the issue. He further made a striking assertion, saying the campaign gained crucial traction, as supporters rallied against him.Hall bluntly stated on social media,he further added, suggesting that the controversy which surrounded his stance and all subsequent online firestorm that labelled him an opposition, quite seemingly unified SKG supporters. The common enemy effect, in a manner, injected fresh energy and helped propel the petition to reach its landmark of a million signatures.The online response to Hall’s claim was a whirlwind. The fans, as usual, remain divided. While some accused him of muddying up the waters, the supporters did defend him and his perspective, with a user noting that Louis disapproved of the pile-on that’s against him.The others even acknowledged Pirate Software’s value to developers and urged collaborations. Echoing on it, a comment on X read, “You brought up some good points, and you should work with the movement instead of against it IMO. Developers like you should have a voice in this.” It further added,showing support to Hall.A user even said that they saw many creator videos, and he was surprised how people were not able to relate to what Hall was trying to say through his. For him, it was an unbelievable side to this entire ongoing drama. As per the user, he wasWhile some followers felt that Pirate Software’s impact on the movement was undeniable, despite his denial, others just ignored everything with a one-word,Not all stood with Pirate Software, though, and skepticism did kick in. There were direct attacks made on Pirate Software. A user on his post commented,Many X users even saw a broader human tendency here at play. As per their observation,While the other added,The idea that Pirate Software became an unintentional catalyst resonated with many and they didn't stay behind to express their words. Some even theorized that he was just a convenient target who got in the middle of the drama, due to his firm stand. As per them, people needed a bogey man and they latched on to him.Beyond all drama, there is the core aspect that was in the middle of the discussion. It’s about the petition’s core challenge- European Union copyright law. While many legal experts and Pirate Software pointed out that the goal of SKG is to force publishers to release tools that allow games to work offline indefinitely, their stance clashes fundamentally with the EU directives, which protect Digital Rights Management (DRM).The Information Society Direction of the EU mandates a strong legal shield against circumventing DRM, the action needed to preserve many games after they are shut down. Also, the existing EU consumer laws are focused on upfront information and product conformity at the purchase, and not perpetual service obligations.To grant SKG’s demand would need a radical and legally complex overhaul of all established intellectual property and contract law hierarchies in the EU, which is far beyond what the petition could achieve alone. The reality presents many hurdles, irrespective of the signature count. It shows and proves that the fight is just far from over, especially as the Stop Killing Games petition deadline is still far away.","The stop killing games petition has now surged past a million signatures.

Networks block top talent from Netflix 's holiday NFL takeover

Tom Brady's off-field life remains under the spotlight

Tom Brady may have found his stride as a broadcaster, but his second season in the Fox Sports booth is already facing serious turbulence. The seven-time Super Bowl champ, who signed a massive $375 million, 10-year deal to join Fox’s top NFL commentary team, is reportedly being sidelined from one of the biggest TV moments of the year — the NFL’s Christmas Day games.According to sources cited by Michael McCarthy and Ryan Glasspiegel, Fox Sports plans to withhold its biggest stars — including Tom Brady, Kevin Burkhardt, Michael Strahan, and Terry Bradshaw — from participating in Netflix’s Christmas coverage of two high-profile games. That’s a serious blow to the streaming platform, which is investing heavily in building its sports footprint by airing marquee NFL matchups like Cowboys vs. Commanders and Lions vs. Vikings.The move reflects escalating turf wars between traditional TV powerhouses and streaming giants as the NFL expands into digital broadcasting. “Some rival networks are bristling at the idea of lending their on-air talents to the streaming behemoth,” the report states, revealing that ESPN is also barring its talent from appearing on Netflix’s coverage.Last year, CBS and NBC made exceptions by letting their announcers cross over.But this season, both Fox and ESPN appear to be drawing a hard line. It leaves Netflix scrambling to fill high-caliber commentary slots while fans are left wondering what voices will guide them through some of the year’s most-watched games.While Brady may be benched from Netflix’s NFL broadcasts, he's still grabbing headlines. The former Patriots and Buccaneers star made waves at Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez’s opulent Venice wedding, where he was reportedly spotted “chatting up” actress Sydney Sweeney, fresh off her own breakup. TMZ reported that the pair closed down the bar and danced the night away.Romantic rumors aside, Brady seems to be focusing on his broadcasting journey — but the tension between Fox’s broadcasting priorities and the NFL’s shifting media landscape could put him in a complicated position.Also Read: Tom Brady flaunts beach body in Ibiza as romance rumors with Sydney Sweeney heat up post-Bezos wedding Fox’s refusal to let Brady take the mic on Christmas raises an uncomfortable question: Is the network protecting its star—or holding him back to fight a streaming war he didn’t sign up for?",Networks block top talent from netflix's holiday nfl takeover.

‘Tesla gave me a future’: Ex-employee on how the company transformed his life

Ex-Tesla employee quits due to Musk’s politics

An emotional exit after 7 years



Respect for the company, not the leadership

After seven years of working at Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada, former engineering technician Trae Cervantes has made the difficult decision to step away from the company, citing moral discomfort with CEO Elon Musk ’s recent actions. Cervantes, who began his career as a production associate in 2018, steadily advanced to an engineering technician role before formally resigning in March 2025. His departure was not spurred by workplace conditions or job dissatisfaction, but rather by a growing unease over Musk’s political involvement and public conduct.In an interview with Business Insider, Cervantes reflected on both the opportunities and challenges he experienced at Tesla. He joined the company during the high-demand ramp-up of the Model 3 production line and described his early days as physically taxing but professionally rewarding.“I started out on their production line for the Model 3 and I moved up from there,” Cervantes said. “When I started out, it was gruelling work. It was pushing heavy things up and down aisles. I was on my feet for 12 hours a day, but they also give you three to four days off a week to recover.”Tesla supported Cervantes' growth over the years, offering him access to professional development programs, including certifications in advanced manufacturing and Lean Six Sigma through local college partnerships.Cervantes credits Tesla with helping him build a career despite having no formal education or technical training before joining the company.“I was getting paid the most I'd ever gotten in my adult life,” he said. “No education, no real skills to speak of, and Tesla offered me opportunities to take charge of my life and grow my career.”He highlighted how the work culture at Tesla—particularly among peers and supervisors—was largely positive and focused on efficiency, learning, and advancement.“I stayed because they kept treating me well. I didn’t have a reason to leave for a long time,” Cervantes noted.However, Cervantes' sentiment toward the company began to shift as Musk became more active politically and made several high-profile public moves, including acquiring Twitter and engaging in voter-related controversies.“What I took issue with the most was the giveaway for prospective voters,” he said, referring to a public campaign Musk promoted. “It seemed so morally wrong. I didn't want to be associated with that.”The turning point for Cervantes came when Musk's public image, behaviour, and political commentary became more prominent in association with Tesla’s identity.“Last year, I started to be ashamed to tell people where I work,” he admitted.While Cervantes did not go into detail about every incident that caused concern, he made it clear that the cumulative effect of Musk’s public actions led him to feel ethically conflicted about remaining with the company.Cervantes decided to leave Tesla without securing another job. He described his final conversation with his supervisor as emotional and honest.“I have to leave. I can't do this anymore. It's getting to a point where I feel like I'm compromising myself morally by walking through those doors every day,” he recalled telling his manager.The decision was not taken lightly. “I’m not going to lie, I cried a little. Seven years is a long time, and Tesla wasn’t always a bad thing for me,” Cervantes shared.While Cervantes walked away from his position at Tesla, he was careful to clarify that his issue was not with the company’s workforce or its mission, but with its leadership.“There are plenty of good people at Tesla. I didn’t leave the place because of the company. I left because of the face of the company,” he stated, referring directly to Elon Musk.","Trae cervantes worked as an engineering technician at tesla's gigafactory in nevada for seven years.

Romantic getaway to a French castle makes headlines before social media shake-up

It seems Cardi B ’s whirlwind romance with New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs might be hitting a rocky patch — at least online. Barely a month after confirming their relationship through a series of intimate Instagram posts, fans were quick to notice that the Grammy-winning rapper has now scrubbed her page of all traces of Diggs.In early June, Cardi B had made her love public, posting affectionate clips of the couple and even joining Stefon Diggs at his fourth annual ""Diggs Day Camp"" at the University of Maryland. However, her sudden Instagram purge has sparked speculation that trouble may be brewing behind the scenes. Diggs, on the other hand, still has photos of Cardi up on his profile, adding further mystery to the sudden social media move.The timing of the Instagram deletion is curious, especially after reports that Diggs recently pulled out all the stops for a luxurious romantic retreat with Cardi. According to The Cut, the four-time Pro Bowl wide receiver rented the Château de Farcheville — a lavish medieval castle just outside Paris — for their private escape. The $12,000-per-night venue features everything from a music room to a wine cellar and spa, making it a fairytale getaway for the high-profile pair.The couple’s romance had been gradually going public since they were first linked back in October 2024. They were spotted celebrating Valentine’s Day together, and again at Madison Square Garden for the NBA Playoffs on May 25. But it wasn’t until Cardi B’s June Instagram posts that fans got official confirmation.While his offseason escapades have grabbed headlines, Diggs will soon need to turn his attention to football. After signing a $69 million, three-year deal with the Patriots in March, all eyes are on his upcoming partnership with rookie quarterback Drake Maye. Training camp opens July 23, and with expectations high, Stefon Diggs’ performance will be crucial in shaping the team’s 2025 season.Also Read: Tom Brady’s surprise wedding date isn’t a new flame—and Gisele Bündchen gives her full approval As for his relationship with Cardi B, it's still unclear whether the Instagram wipe signals a breakup or just a pause on public sharing.

Microsoft’s middle management is the target in its second largest ever round of layoffs



Microsoft laid off approximately 9,000 employees Wednesday, marking the company's second major workforce reduction this year. The cuts, affecting less than 4% of Microsoft's global workforce, hit the Xbox gaming division particularly hard, with several high-profile game cancellations and studio closures announced alongside the layoffs.The job cuts span multiple teams across geographies and tenure levels as Microsoft seeks to streamline operations and reduce management layers. The company cited ""organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace"" as the primary driver for the workforce reduction.The layoffs eliminated hundreds of positions across Microsoft's gaming subsidiaries, including King (makers of Candy Crush), ZeniMax, Raven Software, Sledgehammer Games, Halo Studios, and Turn 10 Studios. Microsoft also shuttered The Initiative studio and canceled the highly anticipated Perfect Dark reboot and fantasy game Everwild after years of development.Microsoft's Stockholm-based King division is cutting 10% of its workforce, eliminating approximately 200 positions. The Initiative, a premium Xbox studio established to develop AAA exclusives, will close entirely following the Perfect Dark cancellation . Rare Studio's Everwild, in development for several years, was also terminated alongside ZeniMax Online Studios' unannounced project.""To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business,"" Xbox CEO Phil Spencer told employees in an internal memo. The gaming division employed about 20,000 people as of January 2024.The latest cuts represent Microsoft's fourth mass layoff in the gaming division within 18 months, following the company's $69 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition in October 2023. Microsoft previously eliminated 6,000 positions in May, targeting product and engineering roles, plus an additional 300 workers in June.The company cited the need to ""remove layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness"" while redirecting resources toward artificial intelligence development. Microsoft's AI-related expenses reached approximately $80 billion in the last fiscal year as it competes in the generative AI market.“We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,” the spokesperson said.Affected employees will receive severance packages including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources, with priority consideration for other positions within Microsoft's broader organization.","Microsoft laid off approximately 9,000 employees wednesday, marking the company's second major workforce reduction this year.

Whether one likes it or not, America was built by immigrants, the wretched masses that the Statue of Liberty inscription asks to welcome with open arms. From Albert Einstein to Elon Musk, immigrants made America a great country, and now it looks like they are making America great again (MAGA, as the slogan goes), and this time in artificial intelligence. America’s edge isn’t just its innovation, it's the global brainpower who has been giving an edge to the country for centuries. And nothing makes that clearer than the news out of Meta’s new Superintelligence Lab: 11 top AI researchers hired, and every single one of them is an immigrant.That’s right, not one US undergrad among them. These are elite engineers, model architects, and machine learning pioneers who began their academic journeys in India, China, South Africa, the UK, and Australia. They trained in America’s best labs, built some of the most advanced AI systems at OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic, and now they’ve been snapped up by Zuckerberg to build the next wave of intelligence. If you want to understand why the US leads the world in AI, you don’t need to look at GPUs or model benchmarks. Just look at the passports of the people writing the code.Immigrants have long been the silent engine of Silicon Valley.

Intel CEO Lip Bu Tan may be planning this 'big change' in company's chip manufacturing business,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-ceo-lip-bu-tan-may-be-planning-this-big-change-in-companys-chip-manufacturing-business/articleshow/122214957.cms,"Why Intel’s new CEO may not be ‘happy’ with chipmaking process promoted by ex-chief



Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is reportedly planning a ‘big change’ to the company's chip manufacturing business to attract major customers. This potential shift deviates from his predecessor's plans and could involve substantial investment. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, two sources familiar with the matter revealed that this new strategy for Intel's foundry business would involve offering outside customers a newer generation of technology. Analysts also reportedly believe that this next-generation chipmaking process would position Intel more competitively against Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) in securing large clients like Apple or Nvidia.After taking over as the company’s new CEO in March, Tan has been reassessing the company's investment in its 18A chip manufacturing process, which was promoted by former CEO Pat Gelsinger .The Reuters report cited sources to claim that Tan has expressed concerns that 18A is not attracting enough external clients and may result in a major financial write-off if Intel stops marketing it to new customers. Intel has already spent billions on developing 18A and its variant, 18A-P.While Intel continues using 18A for in-house chips and select commitments to companies like Amazon and Microsoft , Tan may be shifting focus to the 14A process, the Reuters report claims.Intel believes 14A could offer a stronger competitive position against Taiwan-based rival TSMC, whose N2 and N3 technologies are already in production or close to it, the report adds.As per the Reuters report, Tan is expected to present strategic options to Intel’s board, potentially by this month. However, a final decision may not come until later in the year due to the high stakes involved.Meanwhile, Intel continues restructuring under Tan’s leadership, with steps including new engineering hires and streamlined management. Last year, Intel posted a net loss of $18.8 billion, which was its first unprofitable year since 1986, as it works to regain ground lost in past tech transitions.","Intel ceo lip-bu tan is reportedly planning a ‘big change’ to the company's chip manufacturing business to attract major customers.

"UK’s largest fact-checking firm, with India-born founder, folds up",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uks-largest-fact-checking-firm-with-india-born-founder-folds-up/articleshow/122287992.cms,"Lyric Jain, Founder & CEO, Logically.





Logically, Britain’s largest fact-checking company started by an India-born entrepreneur that once had assignments from Indian, UK and US govts as well as social media giants, has gone into “administration” -- a legal process where a debt-defaulting firm seeks court protection to restructure and avoid liquidation.One of the key reasons why Logically, founded by Lyric Jain in 2017, folded up was social media giants moving away from AI-enabled fact checking. Meta and TikTok did not renew their contracts this year. Pressure on social media giants to fact-check has eased since US President Donald Trump took charge the second time early this year. Logically’s assets have been transferred to another company called Kreatur as part of the “administration” process.Jain had founded Logically with backing from private investors. He had moved to the UK from Mysore at age 12. The company’s clients included US federal agencies, India’s Election Commission, Mumbai police, Karnataka, J&K and Assam govts. It also worked for Britain’s counter-disinformation unit during the pandemic and on debunking disinformation ahead of 2020 US elections.Having won lucrative fact-checking contracts with TikTok and Meta earlier, Logically once boasted over 100 staff in the UK, India and US.“The cost of doing fact-checking was getting increasingly expensive. When TikTok’s contract came up for renewal they offered a paltry amount not sufficient for running the technology. So, they went their separate ways. Meta did not renew because it was moving towards community-led fact checkers,” a source close to Logically told TOI.Around the same time, the firm lost certification from International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), allegedly because the industry body does not allow fact-checkers to work for govts.UK’s The Times newspaper claimed Logically being hired by Karnataka govt in early 2024 to set up a fact-checking unit to parse misinformation ahead of the Lok Sabha elections last summer led to the firm losing its certification. However, a source contested that version. “Karnataka govt did a proof of concept contract with Logically but nothing has happened ever since. IFCN does not have a monopoly on fact-checking,” the source said.The same source disputed claims about Logically “losing” certification. “We didn’t renew it. Fact-checking with platforms was not an attractive business. Logically was gradually winding up that side of business to focus on corporate and govt customers for information advantage and providing competitive intelligence,” the source said.A spokesperson for Kreatur, to which Logically’s assets have been channelled, confirmed the move. “Kreatur Ltd has acquired Logically’s core technology, brand, and key assets as part of a pre-pack administration process. The transaction ensures continuity for all customers and has preserved over 50 full-time roles,” the spokesperson said.","Logically, britain’s largest fact-checking company started by an india-born entrepreneur, has gone into “administration’ logically once had assignments from indian, uk and us govts as well as social media giants.

French finance minister Eric Lombard said Europe must shore up its tariff barriers to counter Chinese imports that risk harming the continent's industrial economy. Europe has already taken action on steel and automobiles, but rules must be changed to allow the wider use of measures against imports from China, Lombard said.""In the world we are in today, we must protect our industry,"" Lombard said Saturday at a conference in Aix-en-Provence, France. ""We must do it on all industrial segments, otherwise the Chinese policy that consists of having a production capacity of more than 50% global market share in each sector will kill our industry.""China announced anti-dumping duties on European brandy on Friday while exempting major cognac makers that agreed to minimum price levels.

Could the electric hydrofoil ferry change the way we commute?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/could-the-electric-hydrofoil-ferry-change-the-way-we-commute/articleshow/122259280.cms,"



During the golden age for ferries in the 1800s, steamboats dotted the shorelines of coastal cities to transport passengers. Then cars and trains took over. Now, driven by congestion and the revitalisation of urban waterfronts, ferries are making a comeback. But, what operators struggle to offer is a fast, sustainable mode of transit. ""Commuters want speed,"" said Jakob Kuttenkeuler, a professor of naval architecture at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.Over the last few months, however, Stockholm has been testing a vessel that may solve that problem: the world's first electric hydrofoil ferry.Developed by a Swedish start-up, Candela, a 30-seat, battery-driven vessel known as the P-12 has almost halved the commute time of a conventional diesel ferry - to 30 minutes - across an 11-mile stretch between the island of Ekero and City Hall in the centre of Stockholm. At the same time, the P-12 emits 95% less emissions than the diesel ferry and uses 80% less energy, according to SL, the Stockholm public transport authority.Gustav Hasselskog, Candela's founder and chief executive, said the realisation, 11 years ago, that his speedboat guzzled 15 times as much fuel as his car had set him on a course to develop an energy-efficient maritime solution. ""High-speed passenger ferries and boats are the least fuel-efficient mode of transit in the world because almost all energy is used to push away the water,"" he said.""If you convert to electric, you need massive amounts of batteries, which are expensive and have limited range. The only way to go far and fast on the same battery is when you hydrofoil."" Hydrofoils are the winglike structures mounted under a boat's hull to lift the craft above the water as it gains speed, much as airplane wings do through the air. The technique drastically reduces drag from water friction and allows for faster, more energy-efficient travel.Kuttenkeuler, who invented the Efoil, an electric hydrofoil board that glides above the water's surface, said hydrofoil technology was a common marine transport system in the 1980s but was phased out because of the high operational costs. Advancements in digitalization, composite materials and sensor technology have contributed to its comeback, he added.In addition to the environmental benefits, the electric hydrofoil has several other advantages. The batteries are relatively small, so they do not require massive charging infrastructure. They do not generate waves that erode the shoreline or wreak havoc for windsurfers and moored boats in their wake. And because they are kept level by a computer and soar over the waves, they do not cause seasickness.So far, Mumbai, India, has the most ambitious plans for the P-12. JalVimana, the local shuttle operator, will begin with 11 ferries on popular tourist routes from the Gateway of India to Alibag and Elephanta Island. A third route will connect the airport with the centre of Mumbai, cutting travel time from 90 minutes by car to less than 30 minutes on the water.","Swedish start-up candela has developed the world's first electric hydrofoil ferry.

"Liangzhu, the coder 'village' at the heart of China's AI frenzy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/liangzhu-the-coder-village-at-the-heart-of-chinas-ai-frenzy/articleshow/122286767.cms,"



HANGZHOU: It was a sunny Saturday afternoon, and dozens of people sat in the grass around a backyard stage where aspiring founders of tech startups talked about their ideas. People in the crowd slouched over laptops, vaping and drinking strawberry Frappuccinos. A drone buzzed overhead. Inside the house, investors took pitches in the kitchen.It looked like Silicon Valley, but it was Liangzhu, a quiet suburb of the southern Chinese city of Hangzhou, which is a hot spot for entrepreneurs and tech talent lured by low rents and proximity to tech companies like Alibaba and DeepSeek.""People come here to explore their own possibilities,"" said Felix Tao, 36, a former Facebook and Alibaba employee who hosted the event.Virtually all of those possibilities involve artificial intelligence. As China faces off with the United States over tech primacy, Hangzhou has become the center of China's AI frenzy.A decade ago, the provincial and local governments started offering subsidies and tax breaks to new companies in Hangzhou, a policy that has helped incubate hundreds of startups. On weekends, people fly in from Beijing, Shanghai and Shenzhen to hire programmers.Lately, many of them have ended up in Tao's backyard. He helped found an AI research lab at Alibaba before leaving to start his own company, Mindverse, in 2022. Now Tao's home is a hub for coders who have settled in Liangzhu, many in their 20s and 30s. They call themselves ""villagers,"" writing code in coffee shops during the day and gaming together at night, hoping to harness AI to create their own companies.Hangzhou has already birthed tech powerhouses, not only Alibaba and DeepSeek but also NetEase and Hikvision.In January, DeepSeek shook the tech world when it released an AI system that it said it had made for a small fraction of the cost that Silicon Valley companies had spent on their own. Since then, systems made by DeepSeek and Alibaba have ranked among the top-performing open source AI models in the world, meaning they are available for anyone to build on. Graduates from Hangzhou's Zhejiang University, where DeepSeek's founder studied, have become sought-after employees at Chinese tech companies.Chinese media closely followed the poaching of a core member of DeepSeek's team by the electronics company Xiaomi. In Liangzhu, many engineers said they were killing time until they could create their own startups, waiting out noncompete agreements they had signed at bigger companies like ByteDance.DeepSeek is one of six AI and robotics startups from the city that Chinese media calls the ""six tigers of Hangzhou.""Last year, one of the six, Game Science, released China's first big-budget video game to become a global hit, Black Myth: Wukong. Another firm, Unitree, grabbed public attention in January when its robots danced onstage during the Chinese state broadcaster's televised annual spring gala.This spring, Mingming Zhu, the founder of Rokid, a Hangzhou startup that makes AI-enabled eyeglasses, invited the six founders to his home for dinner.It was the first time they had all met in person, Zhu said. Like him, most of the six had studied at Zhejiang University or worked at Alibaba.""When we started, we were small fish,"" Zhu said. ""But even then, the government helped out."" He said government officials had helped him connect with Rokid's earliest investors, including Jack Ma, the founder of Alibaba.But some said the government support for Hangzhou's tech scene had scared off some investors. Several company founders, who asked not to be named so they could discuss sensitive topics, said it was difficult for them to attract funds from foreign venture capital firms, frustrating their ambitions to grow outside China.The nightmare situation, they said, would be to end up like ByteDance, the Chinese parent of TikTok, whose executives have been questioned before Congress about the company's ties to the Chinese government.Founders described choosing between two paths for their companies' growth: Take government funding and tailor their product to the Chinese market, or raise enough money on their own to set up offices in a country like Singapore to pitch foreign investors. For most, the first was the only feasible option.Another uncertainty is access to the advanced computer chips that power artificial intelligence systems. Washington has spent years trying to prevent Chinese companies from buying these chips, and Chinese companies like Huawei and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. are racing to produce their own.So far, the Chinese-made chips work well enough to help companies like ByteDance provide some of their AI services in China. Many Chinese companies have created stockpiles of Nvidia chips despite Washington's controls. But it is not clear how long that supply will last, or how quickly China's chipmakers can catch up to their American counterparts.A seemingly inescapable concept in Hangzhou is ""agentic AI,"" the idea that an artificial intelligence system could be directed to act on its own.Qian Roy, another Hangzhou entrepreneur, has developed an AI-enabled digital companion for young people that responds to their moods based on information from the Myers-Briggs personality test, which is popular among young people in China. His team programmed his app, All Time, using publicly available AI systems, including those made by DeepSeek, Alibaba and Anthropic, an American startup.Mindverse, the company cofounded by Tao, who hosted the backyard event, is working on a product that would use AI to help people manage their lives. It can send supportive daily emails to colleagues, for example, or regular text messages to parents reminiscing about family vacations.""I don't want the AI to just handle tasks, but to actually give you more mental space so you can unplug,"" Tao said.Many in the crowd in Tao's backyard said the atmosphere in Hangzhou, set on the banks of a lake that was muse to generations of Chinese poets and painters, fueled their creativity.Lin Yuanlin started his company, Zeabur, while studying at Zhejiang University. His company provides back-end systems to people who are making apps and websites by ""vibecoding,"" or using AI tools to program without deep software knowledge.Liangzhu is the perfect testing ground for his product, Lin said. He can lean over to someone in a coffee shop or wander into a neighbor's living room and learn what kind of support they need for their startups. Lin found himself going to Liangzhu so often that he moved there.Liangzhu villagers have been hosting film nights. They had recently gathered to watch ""The Matrix."" Afterward, they decided the movie should be required viewing, Lin said.
