NEW DELHI: Supreme Court appears set to allow the sale and bursting of green firecrackers in Delhi and National Capital Region for Diwali , Gurupurav and Christmas celebrations.While reserving orders on multiple pleas of firecracker manufacturers for allowing manufacture and sale of green crackers, which was supported by Centre and Haryana government, a bench of Chief Justice B R Gavai and Justice K Vinod Chandran said Friday it will pass a detailed order on Monday permitting manufacture and sale of only green crackers, which conform to standards set by NEERI and PESO.""Did the levels of pollution in 2018 (when the SC had permitted bursting of green crackers within the stipulated time window in the evening) worsen as compared to 2024 to warrant imposing a complete ban?"" the bench asked. Solicitor general Tushar Mehta asserted there was no scientific data to support the view that crackers contributed significantly to increase in pollution levels in Delhi and NCR.Presenting an elaborate mechanism to ensure that only green crackers, which have 40-80% less noxious emission, are sold in Delhi and NCR states, Mehta also appealed to the CJI-led bench not to put any time restriction for bursting of crackers during four-five days of Diwali as many celebrate 'Narak Chaturdasi' on the morning of Diwali day with fireworks.""Let children enjoy the festival without time restrictions. Two hours is too little. The child in me is appealing to the child in the CJI,"" Mehta said. While the CJI said it would be difficult for the court to change its earlier order stipulating the time-limits but agreed to consider the request.The SG with additional solicitor general Aishwarya Bhati said that apart from strict implementation of green cracker norms, the govts of Delhi and NCR states will ensure that no series-crackers (ladis) are sold in market and no online sale of crackers is permitted.The Centre said, ""The sale shall only be through licenced traders, and it shall be ensured that these licenced traders are selling permitted firecrackers only. It shall be ensured by NCR states and GNCTD and PESO that no ecommerce websites, including Flipkart, Amazon etc, shall accept any online orders and effect online sales.""","Supreme court appears set to allow the sale and bursting of green firecrackers in delhi and national capital region for diwali, gurupurav and christmas celebrations.

Poll Do you think the new H-1B visa changes will make it harder for companies to hire foreign talent? Yes, it will be tougher No, companies will adapt

Cap exemptions



Scrutiny of third-party placements



Employer compliance



Restrict employment-based green cards







The Donald Trump administration is pushing for a major overhaul of the H-1B visa program, going beyond the initial shock of the $100,000 fee that is now mandatory for all companies that want to file H-1B petition to hire staff from foreign countries. The proposals, formally listed in the Federal Register under the title of 'Reforming the H-1B Nonimmigrant Visa Classification Program' include several technical aspects which will impact the hiring of Indians.Department of Homeland Security, in its proposed draft, said: “The specialty occupation definition also clarifies that although the position may allow for a range of qualifying degree fields, each of the fields must be directly related to the duties of the position.”This modifies the softening that was done by the Biden administration to mean that there must be a logical connection between the degree and job duties. The Trump administration emphasizes direct relation, instead of mere logical connection. This would restrict who can be hired for which role.DHS plans to review and potentially narrow which employers and positions are exempt from the annual cap, affecting nonprofit research organizations, universities, and health care institutions that currently benefit from exemptions, Newsweek reported.Companies that place H-1B workers at other firms’ worksites, a common practice in the technology and consulting sectors, will come under more scrutiny.More scrutiny of companies that previously violated wage or labor condition rules.This may stop employers use the O-1A visas and national interest waivers to hire high-skilled foreign nationals. O-1A visas are for individuals with an extraordinary ability in the sciences, education, business, or athletics (not including the arts, motion pictures or television industry).The visa fee hike threw the IT companies into disarray initially, as companies rushed to call back all H-1Bs to the US. But the administration later clarified that it was for new petitions and now the fee has got legally challenged. Tech startups will have to hire American graduates as they cannot possibly pay $100,000 for foreign hirings but companies like Nvidia will not have much difficulty. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said his company will keep sponsoring H-1Bs and bear all related costs.","Trump administration is working on new immigration restriction rules.

Features and challenges





Zoho’s homegrown messaging app Arattai recently gained immense popularity. Rival to WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal the app surged to the top spot in India’s app stores. The app has now received attention from Mahindra Group chairman Anand Mahindra . Recently, Mahindra took to social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to reveal that he has downloaded the Arattai app, prompting a response from Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu. Launched in 2021, Arattai—meaning “chat” in Tamil—was initially seen as a niche side project. But in the wake of AI anxieties, spyware scandals, and scrutiny of Big Tech, its pitch as a “spyware-free, made-in-India messenger” has struck a chord with users. The app’s rise was fueled by endorsements from government officials, including Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who urged Indians to adopt indigenous platforms under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative.Mahindra Group chairman and industrialist Anand Mahindra recently gave a public shoutout to Zoho’s messaging app Arattai. Mahindra revealed that he has downloaded the app ‘with pride’. His post on X (formerly Twitter) read: “Downloaded @Arattai today… With pride.”The post shared by Mahindra quickly went viral as many praised him for endorsing an Indian-made tech solution.Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu warmly responded to Mahindra’s gesture and also expressed gratitude.Along with this, he also reaffirmed his firm’s commitment to improve the app. “I was in a meeting in our Tenkasi office with our Arattai engineers, working out refinements to the app and a team member showed this tweet. Thank you @anandmahindrathis gives us even more determination,” wrote Vembu.Arattai offers familiar features such as:* One-to-one and group chats with text, voice notes, and media sharing* Audio and video calls with end-to-end encryption* Multi-device support, including desktop and Android TV apps* Stories and channels for broadcasting updatesHowever, the app is still ironing out issues. Users have reported OTP delays, slower contact sync, and call glitches due to server overload.

Real-world lessons over instant gratification







Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has an important and surprising piece of advice for young people who are dreaming of entrepreneurial success. Bezos said ‘Go work at McDonald’s.’ As reported by Fortune, in a recent interview, Bezos stressed on the importance of early work experience especially in the fast-paced, customer-facing environment. “I always advise young people: Go work at McDonald’s,” Bezos said. “You learn responsibility. You learn how to show up. You learn how to deal with people. You learn how to hustle.”For those unaware, Bezos started Amazon out of his garage in 1994. He believes that entry-level jobs such as those at McDonald’s tech foundational skills which are important for long term success. He emphasised that such small roles are necessary as they instill skill like discipline, resilience and the ability to handle pressure. These are the traits that many Gen Z entrepreneurs may overlook in their rush to build startups.The comments by Bezos come at a time when debate is growing over the value of traditional work experience versus the allure of instant digital success. With platforms like TikTok and YouTube offering rapid fame and monetization, Bezos’ advice serves as a reminder that grit and consistency still matter.Jeff Bezos also stressed that the working environments like McDonald’s exposes Gratification. He noted that the working environment such as McDonald’s expose young people to real world challenges such as managing time, dealing with customers and working as part of a team. Bezos argue that these experiences are more valuable than any theoretical knowledge or online hustle. “You don’t need to start a company at 20,” he added. “You need to learn how the world works first.”",Amazon founder jeff bezos has an important and surprising piece of advice for young people who are dreaming of entrepreneurial success.

In the rapidly evolving world of AI-powered content, Elon Musk has taken a bold step forward. On October 5, 2025, he unveiled Grok Imagine Version 0.9, a major update to his AI platform designed to generate text, images, and videos with unprecedented speed, accuracy, and realism across multiple creative formats, including virtual reality environments and interactive storytelling. This launch comes just days after OpenAI’s Sora 2 release on September 30, intensifying the competition in AI video generation, creative technology, and immersive digital experiences.Musk’s announcement underscores his ambition to transform both the entertainment and gaming industries through generative AI, while also sparking debate about the potential limitations, job displacement, societal impact, and ethical considerations of AI-generated content.Grok Imagine 0.9 introduces several cutting-edge improvements that make AI content generation faster and more versatile than ever. Musk detailed these features on X (formerly Twitter):These upgrades highlight Musk’s goal of creating a multi-functional AI platform capable of producing movies, short videos, and interactive media at scale.Musk’s vision extends beyond video and image creation. In a recent X post, he revealed that his xAI game studio plans to release a “great” AI-generated video game before the end of 2026.A shared clip demonstrated a rudimentary first-person shooter, reminiscent of popular titles like Call of Duty, showcasing the potential of AI in gaming.To further this initiative, xAI is actively hiring a Video Games Tutor, offering $45–$100 per hour to train Grok to produce “engaging, fun, and innovative video games.” The role emphasises AI-assisted game design, including accurate annotations, iterative testing, and fostering interactive entertainment. This development aligns with industry trends. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney predicts that AI prompts will allow small development teams to create games on the scale of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, unlocking entirely new genres and gameplay experiences previously impossible without AI.Despite the excitement, many industry experts remain cautious about AI’s creative capabilities. Michael “Cromwelp” Douse, publishing director at Larian Studios, emphasized that AI cannot replace human leadership, vision, or storytelling. According to Douse, AI-generated content may lack the emotional resonance and artistry required to truly engage audiences.Critics also point to the challenge of maintaining cultural and creative authenticity in both video games and movies. While AI can produce technically perfect results, the human touch—the skill, imagination, and cultural insight—remains central to crafting meaningful experiences.Musk’s ambitions are equally significant in the film industry. He recently predicted that Grok will produce a movie that is “at least watchable before the end of next year” and will deliver high-quality films by 2027. A six-second video clip of generic Hollywood-style action accompanied the tweet, illustrating the AI’s growing cinematic capabilities.However, generative AI in movies has sparked controversy. The emergence of AI-generated actors, such as Tilly Norwood, has elicited backlash from Hollywood. Furthermore, concerns about copyright infringement persist, as AI platforms—including Grok—have faced legal challenges for generating content using copyrighted characters. For instance, Grok-generated images of Nintendo’s mascot were removed from Twitter due to takedown notices. Disney and Universal have also taken legal action against AI companies for unauthorized use of their characters. Grok Imagine 0.9 represents a pivotal moment in AI content generation, bridging the worlds of video, film, and gaming. Musk’s predictions indicate a future where AI can create movies, games, and interactive experiences with unprecedented speed, while also raising questions about ethics, creativity, and copyright.Industry experts argue that while AI is a powerful tool, human creativity and oversight remain essential. The future of AI-driven filmmaking and gaming will likely involve a hybrid approach, combining AI’s technical efficiency with the artistry and vision of human creators.","Elon musk’s grok imagine 0.9 boosts ai video, text, and image creation.

Google expands AI infrastructure and data centres

Strengthening Belgium’s digital future

AI’s potential for economic growth





US tech giant Google has announced plans to invest €5 billion ($5.8 billion) in Belgium to expand its AI infrastructure and data centre network, creating hundreds of new jobs and supporting local economic growth. The investment will focus on the company’s existing Saint-Ghislain site and the new Farciennes campus, with construction already underway. Google said the expansion will strengthen Belgium’s role in Europe’s cloud and AI sector, provide large-scale computing capacity powered by carbon-free energy, and create opportunities for local suppliers and contractors. Officials highlighted the move as a vote of confidence in Belgium’s tech ecosystem and workforce.The investment will modernise and expand Google’s network of data centres in Saint-Ghislain and Farciennes, enabling the company to handle large volumes of digital data and support advanced AI systems. These facilities are designed to operate entirely on clean energy, aligning with Google’s global goal to achieve carbon-free operations by 2030. The expansion will also support the development of new onshore wind farms in Belgium to power the centres sustainably.The project is expected to create around 300 new full-time jobs directly, while indirectly supporting approximately 15,000 additional roles through local contractors and partners. Google already works with about 150 Belgian suppliers, including 80 in Wallonia, and the expansion will further boost construction, technology, and service sector employment. Prime Minister Bart De Wever emphasized that the investment underscores Belgium’s growing importance as a digital and green technology hub.Belgium has become a key location for technology growth thanks to its reliable internet networks, stable power supply, and skilled workforce. Google Cloud already serves Belgian companies and organizations such as Odoo and UZ Leuven, helping them scale AI-based tools for healthcare, research, and business. The new investment will enhance Belgium’s competitiveness in the European cloud and AI market, attracting further international investment and innovation.A 2024 study commissioned by Google estimated that artificial intelligence could increase Belgium’s GDP by €45 to €50 billion over the next decade. Most jobs are expected to be supported or improved by AI, with only a small portion at risk of automation. By expanding AI infrastructure, Google aims to equip Belgian companies and the workforce with advanced digital tools while fostering sustainable and inclusive growth. The investment positions Belgium as a hub for next-generation AI innovation in Europe. It also signals Google’s commitment to combining technological advancement with environmental responsibility, shaping the future of digital and green growth.","Google plans to invest €5 billion ($5.8 billion) in belgium to expand its ai infrastructure and data centre network.

“Intel has unfortunately been punished on a few areas.”

What Arm CEO Rene Haas said about Intel’s missed opportunities



“There are long product cycles. It takes a long time to develop chips.

It takes a long time to invest in fabs. It takes a long time to define architectures and ecosystems. If you miss a few time is very…you will be punished for that. I think Intel has unfortunately been punished on a few areas. They were punished on mobile, obviously, they missed that completely. They were also punished in terms of manufacturing of going to EUV, an advanced methodology for building the smallest chips on the planet.

They decided not to invest in that probably a decade ago at the rate that TSMC did, and they fell behind.”

“Once you fall behind in chips, it's very difficult to catch up because the cycle gets on top of you. TSMC now has the best fabs in the world. The leading-edge companies, Apple, NVIDIA, AMD, they all build at TSMC. TSMC gets better at what they're building. An Intel, a Samsung, they don't get the opportunities. It just compounds. And that flywheel once it compounds and it compounds, it's very hard to catch up in a series of position,”

Rene Haas on cultural divide in semiconductor industry



“I mean, we may have had it a generation or so ago. I don't know that we have it now. And we certainly haven't trained a generation of folks to look at manufacturing jobs as being something that is as lucrative and prestigious. They're sort of thinking, ‘Oh, it's a blue collar job. I don't want to go into that way.’ It's not viewed that way in Taiwan, right? And in Taiwan, if you say you're working for TSMC or studying to go off and do that, it's a highly prestigious kind of thing,”





Arm CEO Rene Haas suggested that Intel could face challenges in matching TSMC’s position as a major chip foundry. The chief executive of the UK-based semiconductor and software design company stated that once a company falls behind in the semiconductor industry, recovery is an uphill climb. In a recent All-in Podcast, Haas, while commenting on the debate about whether Intel could serve as a viable US-based alternative to the Taiwanese chip manufacturer, said thatHe also pointed out the opportunities that the US-based chip maker missed, explaining why all the leading companies like Apple and Nvidia are flocking to build from TSMC.At the podcast, Haas said:Haas explained.In addition, Haas noted cultural differences in how manufacturing is viewed, stating that while such jobs are respected in Taiwan, they are often perceived as less appealing in the West, which could impact the long-term stability of US manufacturing.he noted.","Arm ceo rene haas suggested that intel could face challenges in matching tsmc’s position as a major chip foundry.

A Redditor claimed that the Indian-hatred in the US over the H-1B issue is not absolutely baseless.





An Indian Redditor who claimed to be an ex-Amazon employee took to Reddit to share his rant against Indian managers in US workplaces. The post went viral with anti-H-1Bs reveling in the fact that Indians are exposing the toxicity they create in American companies. The Redditor said Indian managers do not hire Americans because they know they can't push them to work 24/7; and Americans won't hesitate to push back if they are made to work extra.Citing the toxic behavior of the Indian managers for leaving Amazon, the person claimed that the real hiring criteria in Walmart is one question: 'Are you Telugu?'""Same with Gujaratis at Intel, where they prefer only hiring Gujaratis. My classmates from uni used to go to play cricket with intel employees to secure internships,"" the Rediitor posted.""Obviously American will be pissed if they see this kind of favouritism they’re not stupid.

I'm happy at least everyone saw how fragile H1b situation is this weekend and it's not as glorious as it seems from outside,"" the Redditor wrote.The post added that there are exceptions, and America definitely offers a good first-world country experience.""I used to work at Amazon USA and returned last month and one of the reasons was toxic behavior of my Indian managers. They exploit employees on visas, knowing how complicated and vulnerable the situation is since they themselves went through it. Honestly, I don't think DJT's reasoning is entirely wrong there are so many Indians in higher positions who mainly hire other Indians, only to abuse them and their visa status. They avoid hiring Americans because they know they can't push them to work 24/7, and Americans won't hesitate to sue if boundaries are crossed,"" the post said.""Another example is Walmart, which is filled with Telugu managers and employees-the only real hiring criteria seems to be ""are you Telugu?"" and you'll get the job,"" it said.In the comment section, people shared their experience of how they came to know of people who game the system for a green card through marriage.",An indian redditor who claimed to be an ex-amazon employee took to reddit to share his rant against indian managers in us workplaces.

Saudi Arabia imposes fines up to SR2 million in new municipal violation rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/saudi-arabia-imposes-fines-up-to-sr2-million-in-new-municipal-violation-rules/articleshow/124445912.cms,"The new rules classify municipal violations into serious and non-serious categories, with fines up to SR2 million for offenders/Representative Image

The Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs and Housing (MoMRAH)







Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Municipalities and Housing has introduced updated executive rules to tighten control over municipal violations. The new regulations establish clear classifications for offenses, implement substantial fines, and introduce stronger enforcement mechanisms aimed at improving compliance and supporting the country’s Vision 2030 objectives.The Ministry of Municipalities and Housing has approved comprehensive updates to the executive rules governing municipal violations across the Kingdom. These changes introduce a sharper framework designed to classify violations into two categories: serious and non-serious. Each category carries specific penalties that range from financial fines to temporary closures and, in some cases, revocation of licenses. Notably, repeat offenders will face automatic escalation of penalties, ensuring a progressively tougher response to ongoing non-compliance.Financial penalties under the new system can be substantial. For serious violations, fines can reach up to SR2 million, while other violations may incur fines of up to SR1 million. The exact fine imposed depends on several factors, including the nature of the violation, the classification of the municipality where the violation occurred, and the size of the facility involved.For less severe breaches, a grace period is provided, allowing offenders time to rectify the issues before any fines or penalties are enforced.To enhance enforcement capabilities, municipalities have been granted the authority to seize and auction abandoned vehicles and equipment left in public spaces. Additionally, they can disconnect electricity services at locations that fail to address serious violations within the prescribed timeframe. These measures are aimed at preventing the misuse of public spaces and ensuring swift compliance with regulations.The updated rules also introduce a modernized monitoring and documentation system, employing electronic platforms known as ‘Momtathl’ and ‘Efaa’. These digital tools will allow for faster processing of violations, accurate record-keeping, and greater transparency in handling penalties. This move toward digital oversight is expected to streamline regulatory processes and improve accountability.The ministry emphasized that these updates form part of a broader strategy to strengthen municipal regulatory oversight, enhance the efficiency of compliance mechanisms, and safeguard public facilities. These efforts align with the goals of Saudi Vision 2030, which seeks to elevate the quality of life and promote sustainable development throughout the Kingdom. Through these revised executive rules, the ministry aims to foster a more disciplined municipal environment that supports the long-term vision of modernization and improved governance.The Ministry of Municipal and Rural Affairs and Housing (MoMRAH), established in 1975, plays a central role in urban planning, housing development, and environmental management across Saudi Arabia. It regulates the construction sector through the Saudi Building Code, ensuring compliance with safety and sustainability standards. Key initiatives include the Modern Construction Initiative, which promotes sustainable building practices and decarbonization, and the Mostadam program, certifying buildings for environmental performance. MoMRAH also enforces the Saudi Green Building Code, focusing on energy, water efficiency, and resource conservation. These efforts align with Saudi Arabia's Vision 2030 goals for sustainable and livable urban development.","The new rules classify municipal violations into serious and non-serious categories, with fines up to sr2 million for offenders.

The US-China big power competition is the defining geopolitical issue of our times. Undergirding this dynamic is the race for tech, especially AI. Ininvestigates whether US’s Silicon Valley still retains near-monopoly over cutting-edge tech, or have other global locations such as China’s Shenzhen and even the greater London area taken over that mantle. Plus, what’s truly conducive for creating a hot tech eco-system? Is there a secret sauce that America has and China appears to have replicated? The answers are complex.At first glance, China’s breakneck development in tech over the last decade appears to be eclipsing Silicon Valley. But closer inspection reveals a nuanced picture. True, Silicon Valley is undergoing change – described in the book as a vibrant rainforest being converted into controlled farmlands. But that necessarily doesn’t translate into US tech decline, the author says. New American tech hubs are coming up in New York, Miami and Austin that are taking the flame of Silicon Valley forward.China, on the other hand, has created its own tech champions like Tencent, Baidu and ByteDance in record time. It certainly has speed on its side, and its quality and volume of research has also improved tremendously. But it’s still not doing pathbreaking research like US.Why? A combination of factors that includes strict guardrails of the Communist Party – exemplified by the 2021 crackdown on Chinese tech firms – a Chinese university system that is not quite yet at par with American universities, and an environment where govt policy guides the direction of innovation.But to settle the debate, one statistic is enough to confirm US’s continued tech dominance: Apple became the first American tech company to cross a trillion-dollar valuation in 2018 with seven other American companies joining it since, but the rest of the whole world, including China, doesn’t even have one.What then is the secret to successful tech eco-systems? The author interviews scores of tech entrepreneurs and stalwarts across geographies and comes to a somewhat underwhelming answer: there is no set formula. Almost all successful tech companies look the same. But they can come up in very different circumstances. In UK, the greater London area is where all the action is. But that has come at the cost of increasing regional disparity that not only puts London at risk but also undermines the dynamism of UK’s tech story. This disparity was also a reason for Brexit.Switzerland and Germany have great education and no shortage of talent or infra, but their local cultural preference for stability over risk means they are just not able to realise the same tech innovation potential as US or China. South Korea and Singapore created their miracles through huge govt support. But there are also limitations to this approach as seen by calls to reform Korea’s chaebols.But one thing appears clear, according to the author; societies that are more receptive to change appear to have a better chance of fostering tech successes. That means openness to talent, openness to innovation, and openness to risks. In the Indian context, we may have Bengaluru. But we need many more Bengalurus that incentivise tech entrepreneurship and risk taking. That means a policy framework that fosters innovation and a culture shift that normalises failure. India has lots of catching up to do.","Us-china big power competition is the defining geopolitical issue of our times. Undergirding this dynamic is the race for tech, especially ai.

GST rate cut

played a part as well?





CHENNAI: With a host of favourable factors driving demand, tractor volumes hit a historic high this September, and total domestic sales surpassed the half-a-million mark in the first half of the fiscal year for the first time.Domestic tractor sales stood at 1,46,180 units in September, compared with 1,00,542 units in Sept 2024, marking an increase of 45%. On a sequential basis, Sept sales more than doubled from 64,322 units in Aug 2025, according to data from the Tractor and Mechanisation Association.""Sept's record sales of over 1.5 lakh tractors were driven by a combination of factors - a good monsoon, increased kharif crop sowing, and higher minimum support prices for key crops, resulting in higher farm incomes. Sales following the GST 2.0 implementation, which took effect on September 22, and festive buying during Navaratri further boosted volumes,"" said Poonam Upadhyay, director, Crisil Ratings. Overall, rural demand is trending upward, although it varies by region due to local flooding and changes in crop patterns.""Yes, it served as a catalyst rather than a fundamental driver,"" she said, adding, ""Tractors, excluding those with an engine capacity over 1,800cc, are now subject to a 5% GST rate, down from the previous 12%, and the GST rate on parts has also been reduced from 18% to 5%.As most models fall within this category, affordability has seen a modest improvement, leading to some pre-purchase activity.""However, industry representatives point out that the impact of the GST rate cut is largely a short-term boost rather than a sustained improvement.For the half-year ended September 30, 2025, total domestic tractor volumes stood at 5.61 lakh units, compared with 4.72 lakh units in H1 of FY25, registering a growth of 19%.Top tractor maker Mahindra & Mahindra reported a 50% and 20% increase in its domestic volumes for Sept and the H1 period, respectively.
