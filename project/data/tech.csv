The wishlist: What comes next for India?

“Ecstatic! Hell yeah, I’ve been waiting for this all my life.” Linkin Park fan Joel’s words almost encapsulate the emotions of all the Indian millennials and Gen Zs who have been waiting to see the iconic rock band live.“They've been with me from my tiny MP3 player to my current smartphone,” he adds.“They have ruled all my yearly music wraps. Seeing them perform live is a dream come true for all nu metal fans,” says Saurav Kumar, who has been a fan since 2007.The year 2026 is packed with events and shows that bring the musical soul of fans to life. The rock septet is also set to perform at Lollapalooza 2026, which is also supercharged with other headliners like Playboi Carti, Fuji Kaze, and many more artists on the lineup.Legendary performers like The Lumineers and John Mayer will be setting their solo stages for the Indian fans this year too.What’s exciting is that these events talk about the musical schedule for just two months into the year.Keeping 2025 in hindsight, the year that set the stage for global superstars like Coldplay, Ed Sheeran, Travis Scott, Akon and many more in the Indian soil, it is only left to our imagination what the rest of 2026 holds.This only goes to show that India is no longer an afterthought for the global artist tour venues, but a very significant stop.Or as Naman Pugalia, the chief business officer for live events at BookMyShow, puts it, “India is no longer a wildcard on the touring circuit but a permanent hotspot.”India has rapidly moved to become a primary market for major international music artists when weighing their tour route. In 2017, when Justin Bieber announced India as his stop, the Beliebers had a meltdown.Hosting international stars has not been a new thing for India.In 1996, the King of Pop, Michael Jackson, performed in Mumbai. However, the event was very much driven by novelty or an elite audience. But the landscape is shifting swiftly, and the change is driven by both the global promoters and a homegrown audience ready to show up for the live experience in sizable numbers.Naman Pugalia says, “India has become one of the fastest-growing live entertainment markets globally, with a population of 1.4 billion and a rapidly expanding base of global music fans.”And the excitement is palpable, putting in perspective the enthusiasm and active participation of the audience who are ready to cross borders, quite literally, just to see their favourite artists live.Swadha Shankar, who travelled all the way to Ahmedabad from Delhi, shares, “Watching the artists, who filled the silence of your early life with ambition and music that shaped your personality, keeps the flame of passion burning within you.”“Concerts offer collective energy. Music creates a shared experience beyond cities and cultures,” says Gursshheen Gahllen, who most recently attended the Akon concert in Delhi.However, it is not only passion driving the genre, but India has also rapidly developed its infrastructure and management capabilities, which have strengthened the logistical backbone of these live experiences promised to the crowd and have gained more credibility in the eyes of international headliners.Pugalia shares the importance of ever-evolving production standards, which ultimately shape the entertainment ecosystem for these events.“As a rapidly growing economy, India has been a prime hotspot for international artists to connect with an abundantly populous fan community. With the ever-evolving infrastructure for concerts, festivals and live entertainment shows in the country, artists are now joining the bandwagon to woo passionate Indian fans.”India stood the test of quality in front of major touring acts.Coldplay, during their India stop in 2025, added more dates to accommodate the high demand, with each show being a sell-out. Ed Sheeran’s revisit to India also reaffirmed the stance that India can move tickets at global scale.The buzz in India today is unignorable — and it’s not just audiences feeling it. It’s drawing artists to embrace their roots.Tyla’s Mumbai show was a case in point. With Indian lineage in her family, she stepped out not only as a global artist but as someone reclaiming a piece of heritage. She wore a bindi, spoke to the crowd, and the arena erupted.It is not only the passion that is driving the young crowd to these musical gatherings. Logistically, accessibility and awareness have shaped the fulfilment of their interests on a great scale.Affluent millennials, typically aged between 25 and 40 with rising disposable incomes, form the core audience for these concerts. They are willing to stay updated, buy tickets and get onboard with the firsthand experience of witnessing it all live.“When my friends first asked me to join them for a concert in 2022, I got very curious. ‘What could be the difference between streaming on a phone and seeing them live?’” says Mohammad Sarim, “And since then, I have attended more than 15 concerts by different artists.”Music fans are no longer passive consumers through online platforms; they are very inclined to follow artist journeys and travel to cities for shows. This contributes significantly towards boosting an economy that can cater to the quality demands of hosting these global stars.“35% of Coldplay’s audience in Ahmedabad came from non-metro cities, underlining the fact that demand extends far beyond traditional urban hubs,” said Naman Pugalia when asked about the shift in Indian audience towards the live experience.This is not only driving ticket sales, but the travel pattern is shaping a new “concert tourism” market.“We travelled in a luxury sleeper bus from Delhi to Ahmedabad. A friend joining from Mumbai through his connections was able to arrange lavish rooms when Ahmedabad was out of rooms,” Swadha shares about her travel and accommodation.This movement of fans across states has turned concerts into economic events that extend beyond ticket sales, benefiting airlines, hotels, transport services, food outlets and local vendors.According to the EY–Parthenon and BookMyShow report, India’s Rising Concert Economy, India’s organised live events segment crossed Rs 12,000 crore in 2024 and is projected to grow at around 18–19% annually over the next few years.The broader media and entertainment sector crossed Rs 2.5 trillion in 2024, with live events among its fastest-growing segments, according to the FICCI–EY Media & Entertainment Report.Ticketing data also shows Tier-II cities now contribute close to 35–38% of demand, reflecting a sharp expansion beyond metros.For global artists, India’s scale compensates for relatively lower ticket pricing. Volume over price has become the Indian formula, making the market commercially viable while culturally powerful.While international stars have been creating a frenzy, the Indian superstars are not falling behind. 2025 not only saw a big gathering for the foreign names, but the household names also sent waves of wonder during their Indian and international stages.Diljit Dosanjh’s high-voltage “Dil-Luminati” tour powered through North America, Europe, and the Middle East, with sell-out arena dates across cities such as Vancouver, Toronto, Houston, Los Angeles, London, and Dubai.AR Rahman continued to draw packed houses with his “Harmony of Hearts” shows across India and major overseas markets, including the US, Canada, the UK, and the Gulf. Sunidhi Chauhan’s “I Am Home” tour kept venues buzzing from Mumbai to Melbourne.Arijit Singh sold out arena nights in Dubai, London, Birmingham, Sydney, and Toronto, underlining his unmatched global pull. And the world took notes. His international footprint most recently showed up with his Ed Sheeran collaboration on the superhit “Sapphire.”And this is only part of the story: Shreya Ghoshal, Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy, and several others continue to command international stages with ease.Historically, India was not a default stop on world tours.While Indian fans resonated deeply with global music, logistical challenges, visa delays, security concerns and weak event management often deterred artists.Metallica’s cancelled 2011 India show remains a cautionary tale. The event was postponed and later called off entirely, triggering riots and arrests, and damaging India’s reputation among global promoters.But stakeholders have gradually worked to flip that script.“We’ve spent years working closely with global promoters, agents and artist teams, ensuring India is not just a stop but a destination that matches global benchmarks,” Pugalia says.Audience management has also improved.“There were clear signboards, route guides and transport information shared with tickets,” Gursshheen notes. “There was a large team managing queues and seating.”Yet challenges remain.“Parking, public washrooms and security are still issues,” Sarim says. “I’ve lost two phones at concerts.”Recent incidents, including physical altercations at concerts like Karan Aujla’s Gurgaon show, highlight the need for better civic sense and crowd discipline.As demand continues to outpace infrastructure, experts stress that long-term success will depend not just on fan passion, but on governance, public conduct and sustained investment in large-capacity venues.For many touring artists, India has evolved from a novelty stop to a meaningful fan engagement market. Several trends illustrate this shift. From global streams to live public reception clearl reflect the massive shift in people’s reception.Brands and sponsors are also walking the extra mile to elevate the experience by extending the space to a shared experience with merchandise, interactive spaces, photobooths and other amenities designed for the fans to not just attend the shows but an extension of it.Among all this, for an economy like India, affordability plays a huge role. However, population scale compensates for that gap, placing India in a competitive space.Dua Lipa's Mumbai concert in November 2024 drew 35,000 fans, generating crores despite the discounted tiers. Enrique Iglesias' Oct 2025 MMRDA show was also sold out in hours to lakhs of millennials, turning volume into viable economics where Western acts once saw losses.“With the introduction of the variable pricing model, we have been able to drive a shift in the ‘late-buying’ pattern, where customers have begun making the most of early bird offers or introductory prices,” said Pugalia.This positions India as a market with both cultural influence and commercial viability.India is transitioning from a wildcard destination to a stable touring market.Fans of artists like BTS and Khalid have been waiting to find India on their tour lists. While BTS shared Mumbai being one of the venues for their cancelled Map of the Soul ON:E concert due to the pandemic, their 2026 tour calendar still does not list India as one of their stops.The wishlist for the Indian fans, however, is long.“Charlie Puth!” Sarim speaks up in a heartbeat when asked about who he wishes to see live in India. “Artists like Taylor Swift , Jennifer Lopez, Beyoncé, and Shakira would find an audience here that is ready and enthusiastic,” Gursshheen shares her list of favourites she awaits.When asked about what drives the artist's plan and how the pitch is prepared, Naman Pugalia shares a meticulous list: “The curation of an artist roster has numerous moving parts and is a fruit of long months of labour. Global touring routes of artists, discovery of new sounds and performers for a landscape, research and matching of potential artist names with the Indian consumer palate and appetite, streaming popularity in a market and deducing from it as also significant diversity across the roster are key factors of consideration. ”Development and repurposing of venues are consistently underway. The touring frequency for concerts in India is seeing a new rise. The long-term seems promising to witness India positioned as a permanent stop on the world touring maps of major artists.Venues are being upgraded, touring frequency is rising, and the momentum is undeniable.But the journey is far from complete. Infrastructure gaps, crowd management challenges and civic behaviour remain critical hurdles. India’s rise as a global concert hotspot will ultimately depend on whether scale is matched with responsibility.","The year 2026 is packed with events and shows that bring the musical soul of fans to life. India is no longer an afterthought for the global artist tour venues, but a very significant stop. Tyla’s mumbai show was a case in point. With indian lineage in her family, she stepped out not only as a global artist but as someone reclaiming a piece of heritage.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126819023,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1156523,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
Power ministry's draft policy moots automatic revisions of tariff,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/power-ministrys-draft-policy-moots-automatic-revisions-of-tariff/articleshow/127055685.cms,"Draft power policy proposes end to distribution monopoly

NEW DELHI: The power ministry's draft National Electricity Policy (NEP) 2026, released Wednesday, has proposed an annual reset of tariffs, including an index-linked automatic revision in case the regulator fails to act to ensure sound financial health of power utilities, while seeking to limit cross-subsidies for manufacturing units and railways, in an attempt to make tariffs reasonable.While underlining that coal-based generation will remain critical, it has backed nuclear capacity addition with the involvement of the private sector and suggested that atomic energy could emerge as a source for captive plants, replacing thermal.The draft has retained focus on renewable energy capacity addition and also laid emphasis on storage, apart from drawing up a robust cybersecurity blueprint to guard critical infrastructure from rising threats, especially from overseas actors.The overall focus of the draft National Electricity Policy 2026, is on enhanced power availability, with annual per capita consumption projected at 2,000 kWh by 2030 and at over 4,000 kWh by 2047, compared with the current 1,460 kWh.It also aligns with India’s climate commitments, including reducing emissions intensity by 45% from 2005 levels over the next five years and achieving net-zero emissions by 2070, which will require a shift to low-carbon energy.Although the 40-page draft has performed lip service to “consumer-centricity”, it has underlined the need to provide competition in distribution areas. “In line with the intent of the (Electricity) Act, monopoly in distribution will be phased out by allowing multiple players. Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) and the listing of utilities shall be promoted. The central govt shall extend necessary support to facilitate the implementation,” the power ministry said, while recognising its limitations and urging state electricity commissions to act.There is significant emphasis on ensuring timely tariff orders by regulatory bodies, cost recovery and reduction in losses. “From FY2026-27, state commissions must ensure that tariffs fully reflect costs without creating regulatory assets. Tariffs must be linked to a suitable index for automatic annual revision which operates if no tariff order is passed by the state commission… Free power supply should be avoided and subsidies should be paid in advance,” it said.According to the ministry, the first NEP, issued in Feb 2005, had addressed core challenges such as demand-supply gaps, limited electricity access and inadequate infrastructure. Since then, the sector has seen transformational change, with installed generation capacity rising four-fold alongside significant private sector participation, while per capita electricity consumption reached 1,460 units in 2024–25. Officials said that despite these achievements, the power sector continues to face challenges, with distribution companies accumulating losses of nearly Rs 6.9 lakh crore and outstanding debt nearing Rs 7.2 lakh crore. They added that cross-subsidisation has resulted in high industrial tariffs.The policy further focuses on cybersecurity, technology adoption and skill development, and proposes the introduction of a distribution system operator to facilitate network sharing and the integration of distributed renewables, storage and vehicle-to-grid systems. It also suggests a utilisation-based framework for the allocation of transmission connectivity, along with appropriate regulatory mechanisms to ensure optimal use and prevent the speculative holding of connectivity. The draft adds that a strong regulatory framework must be in place to support market monitoring and surveillance and prevent collusion, gaming, or market dominance. “It provides a robust framework for industry, investors and the govt to collaborate in building a resilient, consumer-centric and globally competitive power sector,” said Sambitosh Mohapatra, partner and leader, climate and energy, PwC India.","Draft power policy proposes end to distribution monopoly in india.

"Vaishnaw: India in 1st league of AI nations, not a follower",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vaishnaw-india-in-1st-league-of-ai-nations-not-a-follower/articleshow/127060699.cms,"NEW DELHI: IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw has pushed back on IMF's comment of the country being a secondary AI power, positioning itself as a front-rank AI nation by focusing less on headline-grabbing large models and more on large-scale deployment.At a panel discussion at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Vaishnaw challenged the view that India sits in a secondary tier of AI powers. ""Actually, clearly in the first group,"" he said, arguing that the country is simultaneously building capability across all five layers of the AI stack - applications, models, chips, infrastructure and energy.The minister said the real economic value of AI did not lie in building ever-larger models but in enterprise-level deployment. ""ROI (return on investment) doesn't come from creating a very large model; 95% of the work can happen with models which are 20 billion or 50 billion parameters,"" he said, adding that India has a bouquet of such models deployed across sectors to improve productivity and efficiency.He also questioned the assumption that ownership of large frontier models translates into geopolitical leverage. ""Does creating a large model give you geopolitical power? I don't think so,"" he said, noting that such models can be switched off and may even become financially unsustainable.""The economics of this fifth industrial revolution is going to come from ROI - deploying the lowest cost solution to get the highest possible return. ""A key constraint, he said, is access to compute. To address this, India has empanelled around 38,000 GPUs under a public-private partnership model to create a common national compute facility. The system is govt-enabled and subsidised, allowing students, researchers and startups to access compute at roughly one-third of global costs.Outlining India's broader approach, the minister said the focus is on four pillars: a shared compute facility, a free bouquet of practical AI models, large-scale skilling with a target of training 10 million people, and helping the IT services industry pivot towards AI-driven productivity.On regulation, he stressed the need for a techno-legal framework rather than laws alone. ""Detecting deep fakes with the accuracy which can be taken to a court and be properly judicially checked"" is essential, he said, adding that India is developing tools to mitigate bias and ensure proper unlearning before enterprise deployment.",It minister ashwini vaishnaw challenged view that india sits in a secondary tier of ai powers.

"Eyeing net zero future, Niti Aayog releases roadmaps for decarbonisation of aluminium, cement, MSME sectors",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/eyeing-net-zero-future-niti-aayog-releases-roadmaps-for-decarbonisation-of-aluminium-cement-msme-sectors/articleshow/127019307.cms,"NEW DELHI: Govt think tank, Niti Aayog , on Wednesday released roadmaps for decarbonisation of aluminium, cement and micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSME) sectors, aimed at guiding the country towards a net-zero emission future through sustainable processes.The move comes in the backdrop of the country's climate action commitments under the Paris Agreement and the govt's recent decision to set greenhouse gas (GHG) emission intensity reduction targets of traditionally high-emitting sectors including aluminium, cement, petrochemical and textile to meet specific reduction goals by 2026-27 compared to a 2023-24 baseline.“These roadmaps will not only help these sectors reach their emission intensity reduction targets but also contribute immensely towards achieving India's net-zero goal (carbon neutrality) of 2070,” said an official in the environment ministry.B V R Subrahmanyam, CEO, NITI Aayog, while releasing these roadmaps, emphasized that these roadmaps would serve as reference manuals for India to achieve its unique goal of becoming a developed country as well as decarbonising the industry simultaneously.Globally, cement production is a significant source of carbon emissions. In 2023, cement manufacturing contributed roughly 2.4 GtCO2e emissions worldwide.India’s production of cement resulted in roughly 246 MtCO2e of emissions which was around 6% of national GHG emissions.Similarly, production of aluminium accounted for about 2.8% of India's total GHG emissions in 2023. The country's domestic demand for aluminium is projected to increase sharply from 4 million tonnes in 2023 to over 37 million tonnes by 2070, almost three times the projected global growth rate.MSMEs, which have over 36% share in manufacturing, too rely heavily on fossil fuels to meet their energy and process requirements, resulting in approximately 135 million tonnes of carbon emissions (MtCO2e) in 2022 alone.Keeping this in view, the roadmaps for the cement, aluminium and MSMEs sectors are intended as practical planning tools, outlining how each sector can move step by step toward more sustainable, lower-carbon modes of production. It carries various recommendations and solutions which help decarbonise these sectors.“The move will also help India navigate through the European Union’s carbon border tax on GHG intensive (emission generated during production) goods such as aluminium and cement by reducing carbon footprints in the manufacturing processes of these sectors,” said the official.EU’s carbon border tax - Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) - is a tool to put a price through imposing border tax on such goods that are entering the 27 EU nations. If India does not take steps to decarbonise these sectors, they will attract a tariff burden on such products and impact the country’s exports.Under the decarbonisation strategy, the cement sector will reduce its carbon intensity from 0.63 tCO₂e per tonne of cement to approximately 0.09-0.13 tCO₂e per tonne by 2070. The roadmap for the sector proposes to prioritize the use of refuse-derived fuels, clinker substitution, scaling up of Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) and effective implementation of carbon credit trading scheme to enable deep decarbonisation in this sector.The decarbonisation roadmap for aluminium sector identifies three phased solutions - transition to renewable energy-round the clock (RE-RTC) power and enhanced grid connectivity in the short term, adoption of nuclear power in the medium term, and long-term integration of CCUS.The roadmap for green transition of MSMEs focuses on three key levers: deployment of energy-efficient equipment, adoption of alternative fuels, and integration of green electricity.Observing that MSMEs are important members of domestic and international supply chains, Suman Bery, vice chairperson, NITI Aayog, urged prioritizing technology adoption, access to affordable finance, skilling & regulatory reforms, and increased participation of female workforce to achieve overall competitiveness of the sector.","Govt think tank, niti aayog released roadmaps for decarbonisation of aluminium, cement and micro, small, and medium enterprises (msme) sectors.

Final agreement for India’s first PPP Earth imaging project inked,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/final-agreement-for-indias-first-ppp-earth-imaging-project-inked/articleshow/126955945.cms,"Representative image

BENGALURU: The country’s first Earth Observation Satellite System (EOSS) under PPP saw a key milestone Tuesday with the signing of a concession agreement that allows the winning consortium to finally begin work on the ground, four months after it won the project from the Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe)The agreement was between IN-SPACe and Allied Orbits — the special purpose vehicle (SPV) created by the consortium of Pixxel Space, Piersight Space, Satsure Analytics India, and Dhruva Space — at the former’s office in Bengaluru.TOI reported first that the agreement was expected to be signed this week in its Jan 19 edition. Also, as reported in Aug 2025, the consortium had won the project through a “zero-bid”. While the concession agreement was to be signed within three months, a delay in processes saw it signed on Tuesday.The project will create a constellation of 12 satellites, data from which will be used for applications ranging from climate change monitoring and disaster response to agriculture, infrastructure planning, maritime operations, and national security, where there are huge gaps so far as having eyes in the sky is concerned.The consortium will implement the project through Allied Orbits. “As part of the project, PierSight will build synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites, Pixxel will build hyperspectral & high resolution optical satellite, Satsure will make multispectral satellites, and Dhruva will develop ground stations,” Gaurav Seth, PierSight CEO and co-founder, told TOI.Over the next four to five years, the consortium is expected to invest more than Rs 1,200 crore to create the 12-satellite constellation in low-Earth orbit.The project is designed to enhance India’s data sovereignty and reduce dependence on foreign imagery. All satellites will be manufactured in India, launched on Indian rockets, and controlled from ground infrastructure within the country.IN-SPACe described the programme as a paradigm shift in India’s space policy – one that places private enterprise at the heart of building national capability. In addition to meeting India’s own needs, the consortium is expected to be allowed to sell analysis-ready data and value-added services commercially.","The agreement was between in-space and allied orbits — the special purpose vehicle (spv) created by the consortium of pixxel space, piersight space, satsure analytics india, and dhruva space.

In vitro fertilisation (IVF) has revolutionised the dream of parenthood for countless couples. The advent of this miraculous technology has allowed families who once struggled with infertility to experience the joy of becoming parents, turning hope into reality. Along with joy, IVF also brings some questions and anxieties. One of the most common concerns that couples can have is whether IVF babies are the same as naturally conceived babies, and if they face any challenges while growing up.“The first baby born through IVF was in 1978, and since then, millions of children worldwide have been born using this technology. In IVF, fertilisation of the egg takes place outside the body under carefully controlled laboratory conditions. Once formed, the embryo is transferred to the uterus, where it grows and develops naturally just like any other pregnancy. Over the years, assisted reproductive technologies have advanced tremendously, making IVF simpler and safer than ever before,” explains Dr Sreevani Kotha, Director and Head of 9M Fertility by Ankura Hospital.Babies born through IVF are no different from those conceived naturally, and most grow and develop just like any other child. While studies have reported a higher incidence of preterm birth, low birth weight, and multiple pregnancies with IVF, it is important to understand that these risks do not apply to every pregnancy. Dr. Sreevani also emphasises that such outcomes are not always caused by the IVF procedure itself and may be influenced by other factors. “In many cases, factors such as advanced maternal age or underlying health conditions like high blood pressure or thyroid disorders play a significant role. Apart from these, the reason some women undergo IVF in the first place may be due to conditions like polycystic ovarian syndrome or structural abnormalities of the uterus. These underlying factors, rather than the IVF procedure itself, can also contribute to an increased risk of preterm birth and other risks,” Dr Sreevani explains.With good preconception care, thorough monitoring by experienced experts, and technological advancements, the risks of IVF have been minimised. Single embryo transfer technology allows the selection of only the healthiest embryo to be implanted, minimising multiple pregnancies like twins and triplets. Thorough care of high-risk pregnancy with timely scans and checkups, and identification of individual risks has led most parents to deliver healthy full-term babies through IVF. Moreover, with the advent of technologies like preimplantation genetic testing, chromosomal abnormalities can be detected before transferring the embryo to the womb, thereby reducing the incidence of conditions like Down syndrome, Turner’s syndrome, etc., in IVF babies.“Improved laboratory techniques, more precise embryo selection, and refined ovarian stimulation protocols have made IVF both safer and more effective over the years,” Dr Sreevani assures. Advances in stimulation now allow doctors to tailor medications for each woman based on her specific hormonal profile and overall health, helping obtain good-quality eggs while reducing risks. The increased use of technologies such as the ERA test to determine the optimal timing of embryo transfer, along with single-embryo transfer, has further improved implantation rates while reducing the risk of multiple pregnancies. Together, these developments have reduced complications and improved pregnancy outcomes more than ever before.Choosing a good centre for IVF is paramount. Apart from offering technological advancements, it also ensures close monitoring throughout pregnancy, helping women attain optimal health and enabling early identification of complications.“IVF today is not just about achieving pregnancy, but about ensuring a safe and healthy journey to motherhood. With the right care and close medical supervision, most couples can look forward to positive outcomes and healthy babies,” Dr Sreevani concludes.","The first baby born through ivf was in 1978, and since then, millions of children worldwide have been born using this technology.

Ahead of listing, the company was valued at around Rs 10,711 crore.The IPO, which was open for subscription from January 9 to January 13, was entirely an offer for sale by promoter Coal India Limited and did not involve any fresh capital raise. Proceeds from the issue went to the promoter, while public shareholding increased following the listing.Investor interest in the issue was exceptionally strong, with the IPO subscribed 147 times overall. Demand was high across all categories, led by non-institutional investors, while qualified institutional buyers also oversubscribed their portion multiple times. Retail participation was also strong.Market participants had widely expected a strong listing, supported by high grey market premiums and the company’s strategic role in India’s steel value chain.Analysts said that the debut reflected confidence in Bharat Coking Coal’s dominant position in the domestic coking coal segment.Gaurav Garg, research analyst at Lemon Markets Desk, said the response to the issue highlighted investor belief in the company’s long-term prospects.“The strong response to the Bharat Coking Coal IPO underscores investor confidence in the company’s monopolistic position in India’s coking coal segment and its long-term demand visibility,” he said.Garg added that the anchor book provided early validation, while heavy non-institutional participation signalled expectations of listing gains.Bharat Coking Coal is India’s largest producer of coking coal and the only significant domestic supplier of prime coking coal, a key raw material for steel production.Incorporated in 1972, the company operates 34 mines across the Jharia coalfields in Jharkhand and the Raniganj coalfields in West Bengal, comprising both underground and opencast operations. Its key customers include steel producers and power companies.As of April 2024, the company’s estimated coking coal reserves stood at about 7.91 billion tonnes, accounting for nearly 21.5% of India’s total coking coal resources. In FY25, Bharat Coking Coal produced around 58.5% of the country’s domestic coking coal output.The company has steadily ramped up production in recent years. Coal output increased from 30.5 million tonnes in FY22 to about 40.5 million tonnes in FY25, supported by mine expansions, the reopening of discontinued underground mines and efficiency improvements at coal washeries.On the financial front, Bharat Coking Coal reported revenue of Rs 14,401–14,402 crore and a profit after tax of Rs 1,240 crore in FY25. While earnings have seen some volatility due to fluctuations in coal prices and costs, the company remains debt-free and cash-generative. As of September 2025, it had total assets of Rs 18,711 crore and a net worth of Rs 5,831 crore.Following the listing, Coal India’s shareholding in Bharat Coking Coal has reduced to about 90% from 100%, improving the public float while retaining government control.As a wholly owned subsidiary earlier, BCCL has benefited from Coal India’s technical expertise, financial strength and operational scale.Analysts see the stock as a long-term play linked to India’s infrastructure push and growth in steel demand, though they caution that near-term performance will depend on broader market conditions and trends in coal pricing.“The scarcity value of a pure-play coking coal producer and steady demand from the steel sector support favourable secondary market sentiment,” Garg said. He added that investors should track earnings consistency over time.","Shares of bharat coking coal limited (bccl) made a strong debut on the stock exchanges on monday, nearly doubling from their issue price.

Samantha’s Instagram story reflects Kyle Tucker’s new beginning in Los Angeles



(Image via: Samantha Tucker's IG Story)

The Los Angeles Dodgers have just concluded their high profile acquisition of Kyle Tucker last week, and this move immediately changed the conversation surrounding the future of the team. Although the contract terms took over the headlines then, there was a more intimate feeling that emerged a few days later. It was an Instagram story posted by his wife Samantha, and it kind of indicated what this new chapter actually means to the family.Her post did not repeat the announcement or the figures. Rather, it embodied the spirit of change and provided fans with a glimpse of what was outside the baseball business.Samantha Tucker’s Instagram story featured Kyle from behind in his new Dodgers jersey, his name stretched across the back alongside his number. The caption read, “New number, new team! Let’s do this 💙🤍.” In just a few words, the message conveyed optimism, encouragement, and belief. It felt natural and unforced, echoing the excitement of starting fresh rather than the pressure that often follows a major contract.The post resonated because of its timing. The Dodgers deal was already done and the first buzz had subsided. Samantha’s message was received as a personal follow up and it indicated that the reality of the move was setting in. It contextualized the transition as something to experience, not act in front of the crowd.The role of family during times of professional change was also noted in the post. When Tucker is putting things together to accept the expectations in Los Angeles, the backing at home seems to be solid and assured. That balance is not always obvious but can prove to be very important in stressful seasons.In a bigger approach the post gave some warmth to what was otherwise a story of numbers and estimates. The four year contract worth $240 million, as reported by Associated Press has an extensive signing bonus structure, which highlights how the Dodgers had long term confidence in him. But the message posted by Samantha was a reminder to the fans that there is a personal story behind each deal, which is nurtured through encouragement and mutual understanding.As the season approaches, her simple post has already helped define the tone of Tucker’s Dodgers chapter, grounded, hopeful, and ready for what comes next.",Kyle tucker signed a four year deal with the los angeles dodgers last week.

“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work”

Who was Thomas Alva Edison



What this Thomas Edison quote means



“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.”

Why this quote still matters



How people relate to it today







People remember Thomas A. Edison as one of the most important inventors. He worked on a lot of ideas and had thousands of patents over the course of his life. Many of his inventions are now a part of daily life, like the electric light bulb and sound recording devices. But Edison was known for more than just what he made. People also knew how he thought about work, hard work, and success., is one of the most popular things he has said. Edison talks about a simple habit that a lot of people have. People often look for opportunities in things that seem fun, easy, or rewarding right away. It's easier to ignore something when it looks hard or requires a lot of work. Edison thought this was where a lot of people went wrong. He says that opportunities don't usually come in a polished or attractive way. Instead, it often comes in a quiet way that looks like work that needs to be done.Thomas Alva Edison was born in 1847 in the US. He was curious about how things worked from a young age. As he got older, this curiosity turned into a habit of trying new things and making old ones better. Edison worked on many projects at once and thought that progress came from working hard over and over again instead of getting quick results.Some of the most important things he invented were the electric light bulb, phonograph, and the motion picture camera. He also built labs where groups of people could work together on long-term experiments. Edison thought that being patient, testing things out, and working hard every day were all important parts of coming up with new ideas. A lot of historical records say that he saw innovation as a normal part of his job, not a flash of genius.Edison said,He was using a simple picture to explain a common reaction. Overalls are clothes that people wear to do physical or practical work. Edison used this picture to show that opportunities often seem normal and hard to get.A lot of people think that success will come quickly or with little work. They might want results right away, without having to learn, practice, or fail along the way. Edison said that real opportunities usually require work first and pay off later. Because of this, people sometimes miss out on chances that could have helped them grow.This idea is still important because it shows how people make choices every day. Students might not want to study subjects that need more practice. Workers might not want to do tasks that seem hard. People may put off their personal goals if they seem hard or uncertain. Edison's words remind readers that trying hard doesn't mean you've failed; it usually means that something important is possible.The quote tells people to think about work in a new way. Instead of viewing work as a hindrance, it proposes perceiving it as an integral component of the opportunity.This quote is often used in classrooms, offices, and talks about how to grow as a person. Teachers use it to show how important it is to be consistent. Employers share it to show that hard work pays off in the long run. People think about it when they are deciding whether or not to take on tasks that need a lot of patience.Edison's words still ring true because they describe a reality that many people know. At first, opportunities may not seem appealing, but those who are willing to put in the work often reap the benefits in the end.","Thomas alva edison was born in 1847 in the us.

Deepinder Goyal has tendered his resignation as Director, Managing Director and Chief Executive Officer of the company, effective close of business on February 1, 2026.

Albinder Singh Dhindsa has been appointed as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company with effect from February 1, 2026. Further, the Board of Directors (“Board”) recommended the appointment of Deepinder Goyal as the Director and Vice Chairman of the Board, effective upon shareholders' approval.

”

Of late, I have found myself drawn to a set of new ideas that involve significantly higher-risk exploration and experimentation.

These are the kinds of ideas that are better pursued outside a public company like Eternal. If these ideas belonged inside Eternal's strategic scope, I would have pursued them within the company. They do not. Eternal deserves to remain focused, and disciplined, while exploring new areas of growth that are relevant to its current line of business.

Read Deepinder Goyal's full letter that he sent to shareholders

“Dear Shareholders,

Today, I am going to step away from the Group CEO role, and subject to shareholders' approval, will remain on the board of directors as Vice Chairman.

Albinder Dhindsa

(Albi) will be Eternal's new Group CEO.

Why this change

Of late, I have found myself drawn to a set of new ideas that involve significantly higher-risk exploration and experimentation.

These are the kinds of ideas that are better pursued outside a public company like Eternal. If these ideas belonged inside Eternal's strategic scope, I would have pursued them within the company. They do not. Eternal deserves to remain focused, and disciplined, while exploring new areas of growth that are relevant to its current line of business.

While I believe I personally have the bandwidth to continue what I am doing at Eternal, and also explore new ideas outside of it, the expectations, legal and otherwise, of a public company CEO in India demand singular focus.

This transition allows Eternal to remain sharply focused, while giving me the space to explore ideas that do not fit Eternal's risk profile.

What doesn't change

I have spent eighteen years, almost half my life, building this company. I will continue doing that.

Albi, Akshant, and I will continue to work closely together, as we always have. Our partnership, shared context, and trust remain unchanged. All our business CEOs will continue operating with the autonomy they have always had.

My involvement in long-term strategy, culture, leadership development, and ethics and governance, continues. This is where I have increasingly focused lately anyway.

What changes

The centre of gravity for operating decisions moves to Albi.

As Group CEO, he will own day-to-day execution, operating priorities, and business decisions.

Blinkit's journey from acquisition to breakeven happened under his leadership.

He built the team, the culture, the supply chain, the operating rhythm. He has the DNA of a battle-hardened founder and his ability to execute far exceeds mine. He is more than capable of leading Eternal as Group CEO.

Blinkit remains our largest growth opportunity and will remain as Albi's top priority. Our decentralized structure, where each business has a CEO with full ownership, continues unchanged - and will help Albi execute this well.

On alignment and ESOPs

My financial future remains meaningfully tied to Eternal, and my incentives remain aligned with long-term shareholder value creation.

As part of this transition, all of my unvested ESOPs will revert to the ESOP pool. This ensures that Eternal continues to have meaningful wealth-creation opportunities for its next generation of leaders, while strengthening long-term retention without incremental shareholder dilution.

Looking ahead

Eighteen years ago, the idea that a menu scanning company could be worth tens of billions of dollars, provide livelihoods to hundreds of thousands of people, and serve millions of families daily would have seemed absurd. We helped prove it was possible. And there's a lot in store for Eternal to do over the next few decades.

I believe Eternal is not going to lose focus or momentum through this change. Rather, it is reinforcing its institutional strength.

And personally, I gain the flexibility to explore ideas that sit outside Eternal's scope, without compromising the company's priorities.

I want Eternal to become India's most valuable company. I want us to serve a billion customers. I want us to create the most positive impact on society. I want us to be the source of livelihoods for millions of Indians. None of that changes.

This is a change in title, not in commitment towards outcomes. Eternal remains my life's work.

Thank you for your continued trust and support.

Deepinder Goyal”

(Gian Ehrenzeller/Keystone via AP)





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has a message for everyone on AI Bubble. In a conversation with BlackRock CEO Larry Fink at World Economic Forum’s annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Nadella talked about the fears that has been troubling Wall Street for past many months: whether AI is a bubble. Speaking at a session, Nadella said that it will be a ""tell-tale"" sign of a bubble if all the AI talk focused only on the supply side or the technology companies.“A telltale sign of if it’s a bubble would be if all we are talking about are the tech firms,” Nadella said. “If all we talk about is what’s happening to the technology side then it’s just purely supply side.” Nadella said the benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) need to be ""much more evenly distributed"" to avoid it from becoming a ""bubble"".He spoke about how AI and other advanced technologies are increasing productivity and changing the way we work. Nadella offered a fix to what is called productivity dilemma. According to him, business leaders need to adopt a new approach to knowledge work by shifting workflows to match the structural design of AI. “The mindset we as leaders should have is, we need to think about changing the work—the workflow—with the technology.Nadella argues that AI creates a “complete inversion” of how information moves through a business, replacing slow, hierarchical processes with a view that forces leaders to rethink their organizational structures. “We have an organization, we have departments, we have these specializations, and the information trickles up,” Nadella said. “For large organizations,” Nadella told Fink, “there’s a fundamental challenge: Unless and until your rate of change keeps up with what is possible, you’re going to get schooled by someone small being able to achieve scale because of these tools. ”Microsoft CEO said that the role of AI needs to be examined across all aspects of life, such as how it is helping pharma companies bring critical drugs faster to the market or accelerate trials. He called for AI-driven economic growth rather than just increasing spending. ""We as a global community have to get to a point where we are using AI to do something useful that changes the outcomes of people and communities and countries and industries,"" Nadella said.","Microsoft ceo satya nadella spoke at world economic forum's annual meeting in davos, switzerland.

Merge Labs vs Neuralink





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has announced an investment in Merge Labs, a brain-computer interface (BCI) startup which was founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Rival to Elon Musk ’s Neuralink, the mission of Merge Labs is to develop safe and scaleable brain-computer interfaces. “We are excited to support and collaborate with Merge Labs as they turn an ambitious idea into reality and ultimately products that are useful for people,” said the company.OpenAI revealed that funding made by the company will support Merge Labs’ mission of creating safe, scalable brain-computer interfaces that could one day allow humans to interact with artificial intelligence directly through neural signals. The company has not yet disclosed the size of the investment, but the partnership underscores OpenAI’s growing interest in technologies that extend beyond software into hardware and human augmentation.Merge Labs is a research lab with the long-term mission of bridging biological and artificial intelligence to maximize human ability, agency, and experience. It is developing fundamentally new approaches⁠ (opens in a new window) to BCIs that are safe and interface with the brain at much higher bandwidth by combining biology, devices, and AI.The company is focused on creating non-invasive neural interfaces that can translate brain activity into digital commands. Unlike more invasive approaches that require surgical implants, Merge Labs aims to build consumer-ready devices that are both accessible and ethically designed.The company’s early prototypes reportedly use advanced sensors and machine learning models to interpret neural signals, with potential applications ranging from medical rehabilitation to enhanced productivity tools.Elon Musk founded Neuralink in 2016 and till now the company has made significant progress in developing brain implants which enable people with paralysis to control devices with the help of their thoughts. The Elon Musk-owned company recently raised $600 million at a $9 billion valuation and is conducting human trials.Merge Labs on the other hand, is reportedly working on less invasive brain interfaces with a strong emphasis on AI-powered enhancements. The focus of the startup is not just medical rehabilitation but broader human-AI integration.“I believe the merge has already started,” Altman wrote in a 2017 blog post. “We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants”.","Merge labs is a brain-computer interface (bci) startup founded by openai ceo sam altman.

Artificial intelligence is no longer something people only argue about in tech conferences or future forecasts. It is already quietly shaping daily life in profound and often unexpected ways. From customer support chats to recommendation engines, from coding tools to medical research, AI is now part of how work gets done efficiently. And according to Bill Gates , the pace of change is about to speed up even more dramatically.In his latest annual letter, The Year Ahead, the Microsoft co-founder lays out a clear message. AI will reshape society, economies, and jobs faster than most people expect. Gates says he remains optimistic about technology, but this time his optimism comes with serious warnings. The benefits are real. So are the risks. And ignoring either would be a grave mistake.Gates has spent decades watching technology alter economies and daily life. In his letter, he says AI is different from past waves of innovation. Not just faster, but broader. He argues that artificial intelligence could affect more parts of society than any previous human-made tool.He points to progress already happening. AI is accelerating disease research, improving climate modelling, and expanding access to digital education.Tasks that once took years can now be completed in months, sometimes weeks. For Gates, this is proof that AI can solve hard problems if used well.But he also stresses that hope alone is not a strategy. Institutions, governments, and workers are not fully prepared for how quickly these changes are arriving. Without planning, the speed of AI adoption could leave many people behind.One of Gates’ biggest concerns is how AI could be misused. As advanced tools become more accessible, the barrier to harmful use drops. He has warned that open-source AI systems could be exploited by bad actors, including non-state groups.In particular, Gates has raised alarms about biological threats. He suggests that AI-assisted misuse could pose risks even greater than naturally occurring pandemics. That is not a casual statement. It reflects a growing fear among researchers that powerful tools, in the wrong hands, could scale harm faster than ever before.Gates argues that global cooperation is essential. Clear rules, oversight, and governance structures are needed. At the same time, he acknowledges the tension. Too many restrictions could slow beneficial innovation. Too little could invite danger. Finding the balance will not be easy.Jobs sit at the centre of Gates’ warning. He says AI makes it possible to produce more goods and services with less human labour. That reality will change how companies hire and how work is valued.Some of this is already visible. In software development, AI tools help programmers write, test, and maintain code faster. Gates notes that developers can now be significantly more productive, which lowers costs and reshapes team structures.He also points to sectors like warehouse operations and phone-based customer service. As AI systems improve, these roles are likely to face pressure. Automation will not arrive all at once, but it will arrive steadily.Gates does not frame this as doom. He frames it as a disruption that needs preparation.Beyond job losses, Bill Gates talks about how work itself might change. If AI boosts productivity enough, shorter workweeks could become possible. The same output, fewer hours. It sounds appealing. But he is careful not to present it as automatic.Whether these gains benefit most people depends on policy choices. Who owns the productivity gains. How companies share them. Without thoughtful decisions, Gates warns that efficiency could concentrate wealth instead of spreading it.This is where governments and institutions matter. AI alone will not deliver fairness. People have to decide what to do with the gains it creates.","Gates says he remains optimistic about technology, but this time his optimism comes with serious warnings.

Grok AI restricts image editing features to paid X users

Elon Musk warns, ‘Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will …’





Grok the AI chatbot of Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence firm xAI will no longer be able to generate sexualised or revealing images of real people. The company took this decision after the mounting criticism and regulatory scrutiny. In a post blog post share on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), the company company confirmed that it has implemented technological measures in to order to prevent Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people. This move of the company comes after Grok users were exploiting the tool to create AI deepfakes of women and minors, undressing them in manipulated images.California Attorney General Rob Bonta revealed he had launched an investigation into Grok’s role in producing sexualized deepfakes, citing a flood of complaints in recent weeks. Meanwhile, Indonesia and Malaysia suspended Grok entirely, becoming the first countries to ban the tool. Lawmakers in the UK have also publicly considered a suspension.In a statement posted on X’s safety account the company wrote:Recently, Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok, integrated into his social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), has now announced that its image generation and editing tools will now be restricted to paying subscribers. Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers. You can subscribe to unlock these features,” Grok posted late January 8, linking to X’s premium membership page.Elon Musk said that anyone using AI chatbot Grok to make illegal content on his platform X (formerly known as Twitter) will be punished. Musk’s comments came after the chatbot – hardwired into X came under fire for producing obscene/ non-consensual images, including women and children. In an online post, the tech billionaire wrote “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content”. The Tesla CEO was responding to a post on “inappropriate images” generated by grok.DogeDesigner, followed by Elon Musk wrote in the post: “Some people are saying Grok is creating inappropriate images. But that’s like blaming a pen for writing something bad. A pen doesn’t decide what gets written. The person holding it does. Grok works the same way. What you get depends a lot on what you put in. Think about it!”.","Elon musk’s ai chatbot grok, integrated into his social media platform x (formerly known as twitter), has now announced that its image generation and editing tools will now be restricted to paying subscribers.

All is not well between Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and Meta's highest-paid employee as the company's new reporting structure shows,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/all-is-not-well-between-meta-ceo-mark-zuckerberg-and-metas-highest-paid-employee-as-the-companys-new-reporting-structure-shows/articleshow/126526041.cms,"Meta's new reporting structure reveals friction between Mark Zuckerberg and Alexandr Wang, his $14 billion hire. Wang finds Zuckerberg's micromanagement suffocating, while staff question his leadership of Meta's AI ambitions. A recent restructuring centralizes infrastructure decisions above Wang, indicating Zuckerberg's desire for tighter control over the company's significant AI investments.

Wang's inexperience becomes liability for Mark Zuckerberg as AI race intensifies

Meta reorganizes infrastructure chain of command above Wang





Meta's newest reporting structure is exposing something leadership has tried to hide—friction between CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his highest-paid employee, Alexandr Wang. Multiple sources close to the company reveal that Wang, the 28-year-old founder Zuckerberg recruited for $14 billion, finds the CEO's hands-on management suffocating. At the same time, current staff question whether Wang has the chops to lead Meta's $600 billion AI bet.The tension surfaced this fall during a crucial meeting. Wang's TBD Lab team and longtime executives Chris Cox and Andrew Bosworth clashed over strategy. Cox and Bosworth wanted Wang's new AI model trained on Instagram and Facebook data to boost the company's core advertising business. Wang pushed back hard. He argued the goal should be catching up to OpenAI and Google's models first, worrying that customizing training for product tasks would slow progress.It's an us-versus-them mentality that's become impossible to ignore inside Meta. Wang's researchers view the old guard as mere product managers stuck in the social media era. They're chasing superintelligence while everyone else cares about feeds and ads. Some staff even questioned whether $2 billion was quietly shifted from Bosworth's Reality Labs budget to Wang's team—though Meta's spokesperson denied the figure, the whispers persist.The cracks widened when Yann LeCun, Meta's legendary AI scientist and a Turing Award winner, bolted in November rather than report to Wang. Sources say LeCun bristled at serving under someone whose background was data labeling, not cutting-edge AI research. Before that, Nat Friedman, another big hire, faced pressure to move faster. The rushed launch of Vibes, Meta's AI video feed, frustrated his team who felt forced to compete with OpenAI's Sora before they were ready.Wang told associates that Zuckerberg's micromanagement feels suffocating. Yet here's the irony—Zuckerberg hired him specifically because he needed someone he could control, someone young and ambitious enough to execute his vision of ""personal superintelligence."" The CEO's reputation for obsessing over chosen projects means TBD Lab gets his undivided attention. That laser focus looks less like support and more like surveillance, the report said.This week, Zuckerberg announced Meta Compute, a new top-level initiative reporting directly to him. He's putting Santosh Janardhan and Daniel Gross in charge, with Dina Powell McCormick handling government relations. The move effectively centralizes infrastructure decisions above Wang, suggesting Zuckerberg wants tighter control as Meta burns through billions. If Wang thought he had autonomy, this announcement proved otherwise. The company's trajectory suggests Zuckerberg's betting everything on AI—and he's not delegating that to a 28-year-old anymore.The restructuring carries real risks. Wang's TBD Lab only lost two researchers during their first vesting period in November, suggesting the team still has some loyalty. But the organizational shuffle sends a message that nobody—not even the $14 billion hire—operates without Zuckerberg's constant oversight. Scale AI, the startup Zuckerberg invested in to poach Wang, is already losing credibility in the market. Private investors have slashed its valuation from $29 billion to as low as $7.3 billion. If Wang's leadership at Meta falters, it raises uncomfortable questions: did Zuckerberg overpay for the wrong person, or is he simply incapable of trusting anyone with real power?","Alexandr wang, meta's highest-paid employee, finds mark zuckerberg's hands-on management suffocating.
