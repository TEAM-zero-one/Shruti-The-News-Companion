Rookie Tory Horton makes an early impact on offense and special teams

Why Tory Horton’s rise matters for Seattle’s offensive identity

The Seattle Seahawks took a bold step this offseason by parting ways with veterans Tyler Lockett and DK Metcalf, signaling a new era for their passing game. While many expected Jaxon Smith-Njigba and Cooper Kupp to dominate early on, it’s rookie wide receiver Tory Horton who is stealing headlines with his dynamic play.Through his first games in the NFL , Horton has been making the most of his opportunities. He has converted eight targets into five receptions for 64 yards and two touchdowns, proving himself to be a reliable red-zone weapon. Beyond his contributions as a receiver, he has also impressed on special teams with six punt returns totaling 156 yards.That dual-threat ability has not gone unnoticed by Seahawks offensive coordinator Klint Kubiak. Having worked closely with Justin Jefferson during his time with the Minnesota Vikings, Kubiak drew a direct comparison between the rookie and the All-Pro wideout, saying Horton’s skill set reminds him of Jefferson’s early career flashes. For a young player, such praise speaks volumes about his ceiling.Cooper Kupp’s underwhelming start, with just 136 yards and no touchdowns so far, has created an opening for Horton to carve out a bigger role.Smith-Njigba has lived up to expectations with solid production, but Horton’s versatility and explosiveness bring a new wrinkle to the offense.With Kubiak’s history of developing Jefferson into one of the league’s best receivers, Horton is in a prime situation to grow into a legitimate star. If his early performances are a sign of what’s ahead, the Seahawks may have found their next franchise wideout.Also Read: Kenneth Walker trade prediction: Why the Patriots could make a bold move for the Seahawks running back Tory Horton’s emergence adds excitement to Seattle’s future and raises the possibility that fans could be watching the beginning of another Justin Jefferson–like rise, only this time in a Seahawks uniform.",Rookie wide receiver tory horton is stealing headlines with his dynamic play.

Mark Zuckerberg’s failed bid for TikTok





Shou Zi Chew, the Singapore-born CEO of TikTok, today leads one of the biggest competitors to Mark Zuckerberg ’s Meta. But few know that at the start of his career, Chew actually worked for Zuckerberg. After earning an economics degree from University College London and later pursuing an MBA at Harvard Business School, Chew spent a summer internship at Facebook (now Meta), then an up-and-coming social media startup.After his brief stint in California, Chew moved through major financial and tech hubs including London, Singapore, and Hong Kong. In 2015, he joined Chinese smartphone giant Xiaomi , playing a key role in the company’s public listing three years later as its chief financial officer. His work at Xiaomi positioned him as a rising executive in Asia’s fast-growing technology sector.Shou Zi Chew’s career took a sharp turn in 2021, when he joined ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok. Initially appointed as CFO, he was later named CEO of TikTok the same year, while briefly holding both roles. Under his leadership, TikTok surged past 1 billion users globally, including an estimated 150 million in the United States, making it one of the few major platforms outside Zuckerberg’s reach.TikTok’s rise has long frustrated Meta. According to reports, Mark Zuckerberg tried to acquire Musical.ly in 2016, a lip-syncing app that later merged into TikTok after ByteDance bought it for $800 million. Meta’s own rival app, Lasso, failed to gain traction and was shut down in 2020.As TikTok’s influence grew in the US, so did the scrutiny in Washington over the app’s Chinese ties. Chew has appeared before US lawmakers to defend the platform from allegations of being a national security risk due to its Chinese ownership. During a 2023 hearing, he drew contrasts with Facebook’s own track record, saying: “American social companies don’t have a good track record with data privacy and user security. ”Zuckerberg has also voiced concerns about TikTok’s control by a foreign government but has also warned that banning the app could set a precedent for restricting online platforms.","Shou zi chew, the singapore-born ceo of tiktok, worked for mark zuckerberg.

"Tech layoffs: Microsoft, Salesforce, Oracle and Intel among companies that have cut jobs in 2025",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-salesforce-oracle-and-intel-among-tech-giants-that-have-cut-jobs-in-2025/articleshow/124085478.cms,"Microsoft 's plan to layoff 9,000 employees



Intel may cut over 5,000 jobs



Salesforce staff headcount reduces to 5,000



Google lays off contract workers

Oracle is cutting jobs across US, India, Canada and Europe

Donald Trump announces H-1B visa fee hike







The tech industry continues to be impacted by a wave of layoffs in 2025, following a significant number of job cuts last year. According to the independent tracker Layoffs.fyi, more than 150,000 jobs were eliminated across 549 companies in 2024. This trend has carried into the new year, with over 22,000 workers already facing job reductions across the tech sector. According to a report by TechCrunch, 16,084 of these cuts occurred in February alone.As companies increasingly adopt AI and automation, this ongoing series of layoffs highlights the human impact of rapid technological change and the potential consequences for innovation across the industry. Here are some of the tech giants that have cut the maximum number of jobs this year.Earlier this year, Microsoft announced a plan to cut 9,000 employees, which represents under 4% of its global workforce. This is the latest in a series of reductions for the company this year, following cuts of less than 1% in January, more than 6,000 in May, and at least 300 in June.Chipmaker Intel is reportedly firing more than 5,500 employees across various US states, according to company filings.The tech giant had previously estimated a lower number of cuts, but has now stated the reduction is part of a plan to eliminate 24,000 to 25,000 jobs by the end of 2025. Intel stated the move is ""designed to create a faster-moving, flatter and more agile organization.""Salesforce has laid off another 4,000 employees from its customer support division, reducing its headcount in that department from 9,000 to 5,000. This reduction comes as the company focuses on artificial intelligence (AI), with AI agents now reportedly handling about one million customer conversations. The layoffs occurred despite the company reporting strong financial results.Google has also been affected by the layoff wave, with more than 200 contract workers laid off by GlobalLogic, a firm specialising in handling Google's AI rating projects. These contract workers reportedly believe they were used to train AI models that could eventually make their jobs redundant.US cloud service provider Oracle is continuing its large-scale job-cut drive across its global workforce. The latest round affected at least 254 employees in the San Francisco Bay Area, according to a company filing. Reports also indicate that workers in India, Canada, and parts of Europe have been impacted, including 101 employees in Seattle.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump signed a new executive order that significantly increases the fees for H-1B visas, a move that can shake up hirings in the tech industry. The fee for new H-1B visas has been hiked by to $100,000, a measure aimed at discouraging major tech companies like Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Meta from hiring foreign workers.For Indian IT professionals, who have long relied on H-1B sponsorships for US jobs, this new policy presents a dual crisis: fewer available positions and substantially higher barriers to entry. According to the new order, the increased fees and rules will not apply to current H-1B visa holders or those seeking to renew their visas; they will only impact future applicants.","Microsoft's plan to layoff 9,000 employees is the latest in a series of reductions.

Germany's bid to lead in autonomous driving faces roadblocks,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/germanys-bid-to-lead-in-autonomous-driving-faces-roadblocks/articleshow/124106097.cms,"AI-Generated Image

The energy-efficient swarm



Rural mobility reimagined



From pilots to mainstream







On the grounds of Paderborn Airport, engineer Michael Spengler demonstrates how far self-driving technology has come in Germany. He enters a route into his smartphone, taps a button and rests his hands in his lap. The small car begins to roll, navigating at a leisurely 7 kilometers per hour (4 mph) between buildings and parked vehicles.""It can go faster — 20 to 25 kilometers per hour is no problem,"" the researcher from Augsburg University of Applied Sciences said while sitting in the driver's seat, only as a safeguard, he explained, ready to take over if something goes wrong.Cameras, radar, so-called Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) sensors and a high-performance computer keep the car on course. After a short loop, the vehicle brakes on its own at the destination, where a crowd waits to also get a first taste of autonomous driving.The event was organised by NeMo (New Mobility) Paderborn, a coalition of 75 partners from academia and industry. Like several other consortia across the country, it hopes to help Germany claim a leadership role in the technology.But the challenges are steep in Germany. High car ownership, a strong taxi lobby and a well-developed public transit network leave little room for newcomers to the mobility market.Many projects have fizzled out once government funding dried up.Germany has authorised Level 4 autonomy, which allows passengers to sleep, work or watch movies while traveling, provided vehicles operate on preapproved routes or under remote supervision.But according to the German motorists' association ADAC, progress is slow partly because it is absolutely unthinkable for German manufacturers to go into series production with an immature system.And so, while driverless taxis are already a common sight in parts of the United States and China, German deployments remain limited to shuttles and minibuses on fixed, local routes.Several German towns and cities like Munich and Monheim are testing autonomous driving, and even though not a single accident has happened with such a car, conventional car drivers have reportedly been annoyed by their overly cautious driving style.NeMo wants to change that. Its concept involves a ""swarm"" of lightweight autonomous cabs handling short trips and first-and-last-mile connections. For longer distances, the cars can couple automatically to an autonomous tractor unit, forming a convoy before separating near their destinations.In late August, the first cabs were allowed to drive autonomously on airport grounds. The larger tractor vehicle is still under development, with the first commercial rollout expected in Paderborn by 2026.Energy efficiency is the project's calling card. The cabs, designed for up to four passengers, are half the weight of a conventional car and carry only small batteries, limiting their range.To compensate, the tractor unit will ""recharge them on the move, powered by its own battery, hydrogen tank and fuel cell,"" said Thomas Tröster of Paderborn University, adding that traveling in the tractor unit's slipstream also reduces the cabs' energy consumption.""We're not retrofitting existing cars for autonomy; we're building entirely new vehicles,"" Tröster told DW.Munich startup INYO is supplying the autonomous cars, while HOLON — a spinoff of German auto supplier Benteler — is developing the tractor units.The service is designed to be cheaper than a taxi but not much more expensive than going by bus. ""It depends on whether passengers are willing to accept waiting times, have luggage and whether they accept others joining during the ride,"" said Tröster. For example, a woman might want to book a vehicle for herself alone at night for an extra fee.NeMo describes the model as ""individualised public transit"", especially suited to rural areas where buses are infrequent.Etteln, a village near Paderborn, is among them. In 2024, it was named the ""world's smartest"" by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, the world's largest professional association for technical professionals in electrical and electronic engineering.Speaking with DW, Etteln's mayor, Ulrich Ahle, said the community has been running a so-called e-village car service for five years, in which people can book rides via smartphone. A service for residents without a driver's license would be the ""next logical step,"" he said, adding that the Etteln had already created a 3D digital twin of the village, where the autonomous cabs have begun driving virtually.Elsewhere, Germany's biggest city experiments are moving faster. In Hamburg, transit operator Hochbahn is deploying about 20 autonomous vehicles in partnership with HOLON and Volkswagen subsidiary MOIA. The fleet will include minibuses for up to 15 passengers and Volkswagen (VW) electric cars for smaller groups.Initially, safety drivers will be present, but the vehicles will operate without fixed routes or schedules. Test users will be able to book rides via an app within a densely populated 37-square-kilometer zone.The Association of German Transport Companies (VDV) predicts the first regular Level 4 services could launch within five years. The vehicles are technically mature and legally permitted.But it cautions that autonomous driving won't solve Germany's traffic and land-use problems if it simply replaces the country's 48 million private cars one-for-one. Instead, driverless fleets must be integrated into the public transit system, and scaling up will not come cheap.So, rather than continuing to finance temporary pilot projects, the industry group wants the German government to support a nationwide rollout. Only then, it argues, can the government live up to its pledge to become a global leader in autonomous mobility.","Germany has authorised level 4 autonomy, which allows passengers to sleep, work or watch movies while traveling.

'Real scenario...no job'



German envoy's open call to Indians got questioned by social media users who claimed that the real scenario in Germany is that there are no jobs for Indians.





Amid the H-1B row in the US which will make it harder for Indians to get a job in the US as companies will have to pay a hiked fee of $100,000 to hire foreign talent, Germany has now extended a red carpet for Indians after the UK and China. The video of Germany's ambassador to India Dr Philipp Ackermann has gone viral as he not only invite Indians but also took a dig at the US for its overnight change.""Indians are among the top earners in Germany. The average Indian working in Germany earns more than the average German working in Germany. And that's pretty good news. Because a high salary means Indians are contributing big time to our society and our welfare. We believe in hard work and giving the best jobs to the best people,"" he said.""Our migration policy works a bit like a German car. It's reliable, it is modern, it is predictable. It will go in a straight line with no zigzags. And you don't have to fear a full brake at the top speed,"" Ackermann said, adding that Germany does not change its rules fundamentally overnight.The video sparked off a major debate on social media platforms as many commented that the real scenario is that there is no job even with C1 proficiency in the language. ""Real scenario -- No job until and unless you r experienced and in IT or AI, Fresher jobs need language, language also plays a very significant job in Non IT jobs, currently the market is in mess and the most important of all you said we Indians earn more than Germans in average but do Germans themselves know that we pay that much amount of tax? Because they literally make us feel like we live on their money and tax!"" one commented on Instagram.""As an Indian living in Germany since a decade. Time has changed and job market is really bad.

'Rat people': What people are posting

How government is responding

What experts say





China on Monday said it is censoring 'negative' content online, adding to decades of surveillance and blocking of criticism against the Communist Party.Cyberspace administration of China announced a two-month campaign targeting content on social media, short-video apps, and live-streaming platforms, which are “maliciously misinterpret social phenomena, selectively exaggerates negative cases, and use them as an opportunity to promote nihilistic or otherwise negative worldviews. ”State-run media praised the campaign as a necessary step to restore order online, warning that negative content can cause panic and damage public trust.“The harm of such maliciously divisive content is significant. It can trigger collective misunderstandings and social panic, marginalise reason and facts, and even spark offline conflicts causing long-term damage to public order and social trust,” it wrote.The campaign comes at a time when China’s economic slowdown has hit young people the hardest. Growth in factory output and retail sales recently dropped to their lowest in months. Youth unemployment, excluding students, climbed to 18.9% in August, a two-year high.A long-running property crisis has weakened consumer confidence, reduced spending, and pushed youth unemployment higher.Many young Chinese have responded with lifestyles such as “lying flat,” a term that describes opting for a stress-free, simple life.Bloggers who shared this way of living online recently saw their accounts banned and videos deleted.New expressions of discontent continue to appear online, such as “rat people,” a trend where young people describe themselves as avoiding the outside world by staying in bed and relying on food delivery.Popular platforms like Weibo, Kuaishou and Xiaohongshu have also been punished for allowing “harmful” content, including celebrity gossip, to dominate trending lists.The regulator said it will also act against posts that spread fear, encourage hostility between groups, or promote “defeatist” ideas, such as “effort is useless.”It also warned against businesses that “sell anxiety” by exploiting people’s worries about jobs, education, or relationships.The regulator asked the public to “actively report such cases” in order to “stop the spread of negative sentiment.”Ja Ian Chong, a political science professor at the National University of Singapore, told CNN that many Chinese people feel pessimistic about their future.He said the government may be trying to boost confidence and spending by controlling public sentiment online. But he added that without real improvements in jobs and opportunities, changing online chatter may not change how people actually feel.“The state will try to clamp down on these new terms and expressions as they emerge, but they will simply continue to evolve,” Chong said.","China said it is censoring 'negative' content online, adding to decades of surveillance and blocking of criticism against the communist party.
