Currently, Aadhaar authentication is required only for Tatkal bookings.

Who is Carlie Irsay-Gordon? Colts’ new owner fully involved on game day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/who-is-carlie-irsay-gordon-colts-new-owner-fully-involved-on-game-day/articleshow/123896787.cms,"Carlie Irsay-Gordon on field

Carlie Irsay-Gordon takes charge

A new type of NFL owner

Also:

For Indianapolis Colts fans, seeing a team owner wearing a headset and jotting down notes on the sideline isn’t exactly an everyday sight. Yet that’s exactly what unfolded during a recent preseason game, when co-owner and CEO Carlie Irsay-Gordon caught attention for her active game-day involvement.Her approach signals a new era for the Colts, one shaped by a mix of family tradition and fresh leadership. Following the passing of her father, longtime Colts owner Jim Irsay, in May 2025, Carlie has stepped into the lead role, becoming the face of a new chapter in the franchise’s story.Ownership of the Colts has now transitioned into a true family affair. Carlie serves as principal owner and CEO, while her sisters Casey Foyt and Kalen Jackson hold key roles as executive vice president and chief brand officer.Together, they represent the next generation of leadership. But it’s Carlie who has stepped into the spotlight, and her actions already suggest she wants to run things in a far more engaged style than many NFL owners.Her game-day presence has been the clearest sign yet. During the Colts’ second preseason contest against the Packers, Carlie joined the broadcast team in the third quarter, headset on, notepad in hand.She wasn’t just there for show.By listening to play calls and jotting notes, she has made it clear she is serious about understanding the technical and strategic details of the game. It’s a continuation of the tradition set by her father, who was famous for his visible, passionate presence with the team.Carlie has been equally vocal off the field about her approach to leadership. In recent interviews, she’s stressed the need for owners to truly understand every aspect of their organization. That means being involved, asking hard questions, and ensuring executives are held accountable for their choices.She believes this kind of hands-on leadership helps avoid costly mistakes, and her direct, no-nonsense style has already struck a chord with both fans and players. Safety Cam Bynum, for example, praised her commitment and energy, a reflection of how her involvement is being received inside the locker room.Of course, not everyone agrees on her style. Some fans online have debated whether her sideline presence veers into micromanagement, while others see it as refreshing and forward-thinking. What’s clear is that Carlie isn’t content to simply sit in the luxury box and let others do the work. She wants to learn, participate, and shape the Colts’ future firsthand.As the Colts move forward under her guidance, Carlie Irsay-Gordon is redefining what it means to own an NFL franchise. By blending passion, accountability, and presence, she has positioned herself not just as the heir to her father’s legacy but as a leader determined to leave her own.","Carlie irsay-gordon caught attention for her active game-day involvement.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has told employees that the company needs to “do better” in rebuilding trust with its workforce. The remarks come after months of layoffs and a new return-to-office rule that the company announced recently. When an employee asked Nadella to speak about a perceived lack of empathy in the company’s culture, the Microsoft CEO said “I deeply appreciate that, the question and the sentiment behind it,” as per an audio obtained by CNBC. “I take it as feedback for me and everyone in the leadership team, because at the end of the day, I think we can do better, and we will do better.""According to audio obtained by CNBC, HR chief Amy Coleman acknowledged mixed reactions to the return-to-office mandate during the session. Some employees fear a loss of autonomy, though data shows staff around Seattle already average 2.4 days in the office each week.Nadella acknowledged that remote work can make mentorship harder for new employees and interns. “Management is just mostly all remote, but the interns are all, you know, in one location. And so those are things that just will break a social contract,” he said.Still, Satya Nadella cautioned staff about long-term challenges. “Some of the biggest businesses we built may not be as relevant going forward,” he warned. “Some of the margin that we love today may not be there tomorrow, and that means you have to be way ahead of all of those going away, right?”“We have some very, very hard work ahead of us and that hard process of renewal is essentially what we have to do,” Nadella said.“You have to be hardcore in terms of an intellectual honesty about what really needs to happen.”The meeting also touched on fallout from a Guardian report alleging that Israel’s military used Microsoft’s Azure cloud to store Palestinians’ phone calls during the Gaza conflict. Microsoft has since fired five employees who protested against the company’s involvement.President Brad Smith addressed the issue, saying Microsoft will support Jewish employees who have faced harassment. “We don’t get to control what happens outside Microsoft, but we need to be clear about one thing,” Smith said.“There is no room for antisemitism at Microsoft, and as a company and as a community, we will protect this group and defend them from that,” the executive added.",Microsoft ceo satya nadella has told employees that the company needs to “do better” in rebuilding trust with its workforce.

Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff recently poked fun at rival Palantir’s steep prices, calling its software “the most expensive enterprise software I’ve ever seen” before joking, “Maybe I’m not charging enough. ” Benioff made the remark during an interview with CNBC’s Morgan Brennan at Goldman Sachs’ Communacopia+Technology conference in San Francisco last week. His comments come as Palantir, known for its data management tools used by companies and government agencies, enjoys surging investor enthusiasm.“I am so inspired by that company,” Benioff said. “Not just because they have 100 times multiple on their revenue, which I would love to have that too. Maybe it’ll have 1000 times soon.”Despite the praise, Benioff’s jab underscored the growing rivalry. Salesforce generated more than $10 billion in revenue in its latest quarter, ten times Palantir’s size, but Palantir’s revenue growth rate of 48% far outpaces Salesforce’s 10%.It wasn’t the first time Benioff raised Palantir’s pricing. Just last week, he told CNBC’s Jim Cramer that Salesforce offers “a very competitive product at a much lower cost.”Palantir CEO Alex Karp responded on the TBPN podcast, saying the company is “very focused on value creation” and asks to be “modestly compensated for that value.”The two companies also compete for government contracts. Marc Benioff recently touted Salesforce’s win over Palantir in a US Army deal, highlighting the direct competition between the tech firms.Founded in 1999, Salesforce went public in 2004, years before Palantir’s 2020 stock market debut.

ESPN’s Molly Qerim eyeing exit from ‘First Take’ by year’s end



Molly Qerim has a strong passion for journalism



Molly Qerim, one of the faces of ESPN’s First Take for nearly a decade, is reportedly preparing to leave the network at the end of 2025. According to Sports Business Journal’s Austin Karp, ESPN offered Qerim a new contract to stay on, but she chose to move forward with the next phase of her career. The decision marks the end of a run that began in 2015 when she became the permanent moderator of the popular debate show.Molly Qerim has been a central figure on First Take, working alongside Stephen A. Smith and a rotating cast of analysts who have helped make the program one of ESPN’s signature offerings. She originally joined ESPN in 2006, starting in digital and mobile roles before shifting to the news team two years later. Her early work included serving as an interactive host on College Football Live and a reporter for Fantasy Football Now, which earned her an Emmy. However, per reports, she is looking to leave the network for reasons unknown.Before her full-time return to ESPN, Qerim spent several years at CBS Sports and the NFL Network, where she hosted NFL AM and NFL Fantasy Live. In 2015, she stepped in as a fill-in moderator for First Take during the summer, eventually replacing Cari Champion later that year.Her tenure has been defined by her ability to balance Smith’s strong personality with thoughtful, measured hosting that keeps the program engaging and fast-paced.Throughout her career, Qerim has been open about the drive that led her to sports broadcasting. “I always knew I wanted to be a journalist or television host from a very young age,” she told New Era earlier this year. “Probably about 12 years old, I remember buying magazines, and I would rip out profiles on different journalists and TV hosts and study them and their path. I knew that’s what I always wanted to do. The goal was to build a platform and help as many people as I can, and that’s still the goal today. ”She also spoke about the joy she finds off-camera. “My favorite time at work is either when I’m on set with the guys, cracking jokes with each other and having a good time,” Qerim said. “And also interviewing – I’m really fascinated by people when I can connect and learn from them and hear their story. In terms of athletes, you want to convey the truth and their story. You want to inform the viewer and also entertain them – sports are hopefully a respite. ”Also Read: Phil Mickelson explodes at sick online support for Tyler Robinson after Charlie Kirk assassination in Utah With her departure looming, ESPN must look for a new moderator for one of its most-watched daily programs, while Qerim closes a defining chapter in her broadcasting journey.

Broader visa reforms in 2025





In a country best known for attracting high-net-worth investors, entrepreneurs, skilled professionals, and tech innovators, the UAE’s residency landscape has steadily grown to include one often-overlooked group: retirees. Through a dedicated 5-year renewable retirement visa, the UAE offers financially stable expatriates aged 55 and above a pathway to long-term residency, without the need for employment or active business activity.While most of the country’s residency categories continue to focus on sectors like investment, talent, and workforce development, including Golden Visas for specialists, the Blue Visa for sustainability experts, and expanded permits for digital creators and healthcare professionals, this program stands apart in its simplicity and purpose. It’s a quiet but strategic effort to welcome global citizens looking not just to build, but to settle, offering them a tax-friendly, secure environment for retirement. Here's a complete breakdown of the retirement visa: who can apply, what’s required, the costs involved, and how Dubai’s variant adds even more flexibility to the national framework.The UAE’s retirement visa program provides a 5-year renewable residency option for foreign retirees who wish to settle in the country after their working years.The policy is applicable across all emirates, with Dubai offering an additional customized version of the program. It was officially introduced by the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs, and Port Security (ICP) in December 2024, as part of a broader federal update to residency and ID regulations aimed at creating more flexible long-term visa pathways.Applicants must meet all of the following base criteria:In addition, applicants must fulfill at least one of the following financial conditions:Special Case (Dubai Only): Dubai residents are eligible with a lower income threshold of AED 15,000 ($4,050) per month.Applicants are also required to submit a bank statement from the past six months to confirm financial eligibility.The ICP (Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs, and Port Security) manages the retirement visa application process through its digital platforms, namely the official ICP website and the UAEICP smart application.The process involves four primary steps through the UAEICP smart application or official website:In addition to federal guidelines, Dubai offers its own retirement visa initiative, tailored to attract global retirees, their spouses, and dependents. It comes with a choice of four financial qualification options, any one of which would make the applicant eligible:This flexibility allows applicants to tailor their approach based on income, assets, or a mix of both. Foreign applicants can apply through the GDRFAD website under the section titled ‘Issuing a residence permit for the retired foreigner’.To complete the application for the UAE Retirement Visa, applicants must provide documents specific to the financial route they are applying under. The documentation ensures the applicant meets eligibility criteria and supports the processing of the visa.Applicants applying through a financial deposit must submit:Applicants applying through regular income must submit:Note: All documents must be valid and clearly support the financial eligibility route chosen by the applicant. Failure to provide complete documentation may result in delays or rejection.While referred to by some as a “free” visa in media reports, the UAE retirement visa does involve multiple fees for processing, medical testing, and administrative services.Total Estimated Range: AED 2,300 to AED 3,800 ($621 to $1,026)These figures highlight that, while the visa is employment-independent, it is not fee-exempt, and applicants should budget accordingly.The retirement visa is more than just a residency document, it’s a cornerstone of the UAE’s broader strategy for global competitiveness and population diversification.The program aligns with the UAE’s Vision 2031, aimed at diversifying national income sources, increasing global talent retention, and transforming the Emirates into a full-spectrum destination — not just for careers but also for retirement, investment, and quality of life.The retirement visa is part of the UAE’s broader 2025 residency reforms aimed at attracting long-term residents across diverse sectors. Recent additions include the Blue Visa for environmental experts, expanded Golden Visas for teachers, nurses, digital content creators, and luxury yacht owners, and an enhanced Golden Visa for e-sports and gaming professionals. The rollout also features AI-driven processing for faster approvals, reflecting the UAE’s push for a more inclusive and efficient residency framework.","The uae retirement visa is issued for a five-year period. Applicants must be 55 or older, with property worth aed 1 million, or a monthly income of aed 20,000. The visa offers a pathway for long-term stability in the uae.

'Lasting change'

High demand





KALIAKRA: Faced with rising Black Sea temperatures that suffocate his mussels, Bulgarian farmer Nayden Stanev has been forced to change his ways -- shifting his seeding schedule and harvesting at cooler depths.Yet Stanev, a 56-year-old former marine commando, sees the fallout from climate change as both a threat and opportunity for his business.As bad as it is for Bulgaria's mussel farmers, their peers in the Mediterranean Sea have had to deal with even higher water temperatures.""We are better off,"" Stanev told AFP.Though the Balkan EU member still trails far behind major Mediterranean mussel producers such as Spain and Italy, it has taken the lead in the Black Sea.And it is less affected by marine heat waves, which have led to a sharp decline in Europe's mussel crop, according to experts.But the warmer waters are still a threat to Black Sea mussel farmers.""About 20 percent of the mussels didn't survive"" this year, Stanev said gravely, as empty shells piled up on deck of his old diesel boat.""Last year, it was a massacre -- 80 percent wiped out. The mussels literally suffocate in a sea that warms too fast,"" he added.Scientists say climate change is making marine heatwaves more frequent and powerful, and the Mediterranean region is warming faster than the global average.In July, the average surface temperature of the Mediterranean Sea was 26.79C, the hottest ever for that month, according to research centre Mercator Ocean International.During the same period, the average surface temperature in the Black Sea was 25.46C -- less than in the Mediterranean, though it is also warming.""When temperatures approach or exceed about 26C -- a threshold associated with mass mussel mortalities -- for extended periods during peak market seasons, it creates disruptions in the supply chain,"" John Theodorou, an expert at the University of Patras in Greece, told AFP.In the Black Sea, the surface temperature has risen by nearly two degrees in two years, according to Radoslava Bekova from the Institute of Oceanology at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences.""The sea is undergoing lasting changes,"" she told AFP.She added prolonged warming periods, when the sea doesn't have time to cool down, weaken the mussels, making them more vulnerable to diseases.Together with his six employees, Bulgaria pioneer Stanev is on deck at dawn to harvest and deliver his mussels, with the season reaching its peak at the end of August.He set up his business more than 20 years ago in the bay of Cape Kaliakra, a prime location protected from currents.His phone ringing incessantly, Stanev jots down the orders on a small notebook.On this day, he has to deliver no fewer than 10 tonnes of mussels to cater to the demand of hundreds of restaurants and vendors in Bulgaria and neighbouring Romania.After a short trip from shore, the crew reaches the 200-hectare mussel farm.Black buoys float on the surface, with long tubular nets holding the shells attached to them.The men work in silence with synchronised gestures: one pulls the nets out of the water, another cleans them and a third sorts the shells.Mussel bags pile up, each containing about 800 kilogrammes, as cormorants scout for leftovers.When the boat returns to the quay in the early afternoon, several refrigerated trucks are already waiting, along with villagers with empty buckets, eager to buy fresh mussels for their families.While global production has continued to grow, it has been declining in the EU since 2018, according to data from the European Market Observatory for Fisheries and Aquaculture Products (EUMOFA).About 356,500 tonnes of mussels were harvested in the EU in 2023 -- about 21 percent fewer than in 2018, according to EUMOFA data.Spain led with 155,700 tonnes followed by Italy with 57,279 tonnes -- by comparison, Bulgaria accounted for about 1,100 tonnes.While European production fell over that period, their value increased almost 50 percent, standing at roughly 463 million euros in 2023.""This value gap has created opportunities for Black Sea mussel production,"" Theodorou said.","Bulgarian farmer nayden stanev has had to adjust the seeding schedule and work at greater depths.

Indonesia mining: Government reopens nickel project in dive hotspot; environmentalists warn of damage,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/indonesia-mining-government-reopens-nickel-project-in-dive-hotspot-environmentalists-warn-of-damage/articleshow/123882992.cms,"



Jakarta: Indonesia has allowed a nickel mining company to resume operations in a pristine marine zone despite protests from activists and residents, according to AFP. The decision covers Gag island in the Raja Ampat archipelago of Southwest Papua Province, a world-renowned diving site located within the Coral Triangle.PT Gag Nikel, a subsidiary of state-owned Aneka Tambang, restarted operations on September 3 after the government lifted a suspension imposed earlier this year, the agency reported. The Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources confirmed the resumption, saying environmental audits had been carried out.Environment Minister Hanif Faisol Nurofiq said the firm had received a “green” rating from the government, signalling compliance with environmental standards. “We have once again reviewed all our data related to mining operations at Gag Nikel... An environmental audit was conducted to ensure that the impact caused by Gag Nikel can be properly mitigated,” he told reporters in Bali.Hanif added that authorities would continue to monitor and supervise operations. “Of course... there will always be concerns. That is why we must balance development and environmental protection,” he said.The government had in June revoked permits for four of five nickel mining companies in Raja Ampat after strong local opposition. Gag Nikel was initially exempted but was later suspended while environmental studies were undertaken, according to AFP.Environmental groups remain critical. Greenpeace Indonesia warned that nickel mining threatens the region’s biodiversity, home to three-quarters of the world’s known hard-coral species. “The environmental impact will be irreversible, potentially causing the island to sink due to the rising climate crisis. Eventually, we risk losing the island itself,” Greenpeace campaigner Arie Rompas was quoted as saying.According to Greenpeace, mining on Gag, Kawe and Manuran islands has already destroyed more than 500 hectares (1,200 acres) of forest and vegetation.Indonesia holds the world’s largest reserves of nickel and is the biggest producer of the mineral used in stainless steel and electric vehicle batteries. Following a 2020 export ban, the sector has become central to the government’s industrial growth strategy.",Indonesia has allowed a nickel mining company to resume operations in a pristine marine zone.

The road ahead







In the aftermath of June's tragic Air India crash , two young engineers believe they may have found a way to make the skies safer with outside airbags for aeroplanes.The futuristic safety concept, called Project REBIRTH, has been shortlisted for the prestigious James Dyson Award, which honours groundbreaking inventions that can change the world.Designed by Eshel Wasim and Dharsan Srinivasan of the Birla Institute of Technology and Science's Dubai campus, the system uses artificial intelligence to predict imminent crashes and deploy protective airbags around the aircraft's fuselage, according to the James Dyson Award's official website. The idea, however unconventional, is simple: cushion the plane like a giant inflatable cocoon to turn otherwise fatal impacts into survivable landings.""Project REBIRTH is the first AI-powered crash survival system,"" the inventors explained. ""It deploys smart airbags, impact-absorbing fluids, and reverse thrust mid-air — turning fatal crashes into survivable landings.""The two engineers said the idea came after the Air India Flight 171 disaster in Ahmedabad in June, when a 787-8 Dreamliner crashed just seconds after takeoff, killing 241 of the 242 people on board.""After the June 2025 crash, my mother couldn't sleep,"" one of the creators recalled. ""She kept thinking about the fear the passengers and pilots must have felt, knowing there was no way out. That helplessness haunted us. Why isn't there a system for survival after failure?""The REBIRTH system continuously monitors altitude, speed, engine performance, fire, direction, and pilot response.If a crash below 3,000 feet is deemed unavoidable, the airbags deploy within two seconds from the nose, belly, and tail, wrapping the fuselage in padded layers, according to the official website.The designers hope to partner with aerospace labs for crash sledge and wind tunnel testing. While no timeline has been set for real-world trials, they say their goal is clear: to make REBIRTH ""tested, approved, and used in real flights.""If they win the James Dyson Award on November 5, they'll receive more than $40,000 and support to launch their own company. But Wasim and Srinivasan insist their mission goes beyond money or recognition.""This competition is our first step in bringing our vision forward — not for fame, but with the hope that one day, it may help save lives when all else fails,"" they said.","Ai-powered plane airbags detects failure, deploys airbags, forms protective cocoon, absorbs impact- passengers survive.

AI startup Krutrim faces reality check,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ai-startup-krutrim-faces-reality-check/articleshow/123908669.cms,"



BENGALURU: What was once billed as India's challenger to global giants in artificial intelligence and semiconductors has quietly dwindled into a shadow of those ambitions. Krutrim, the AI venture founded by Ola's Bhavish Aggarwal, is now largely sustained by his personal wealth and loans tied to his Ola Electric stake, with most of its marquee projects abandoned.""The money that was raised from Z47 (formerly Matrix Partners India) is long gone,"" said a senior executive familiar with the company's finances. ""At its peak, Krutrim was burning through at least $4-5 million every month. None of it is backed by new investors anymore. It's Bhavish's own money that has been going out.""Launched in Dec 2023, Krutrim swiftly reached unicorn status with sweeping ambitions: design semiconductor chips, build an Indian cloud alternative, and develop AI models from scratch. Aggarwal even acquired Bodhi, a startup founded by former Intel veterans, to turbocharge chip design. Insiders, however, said the simultaneous bets on compute, cloud, and chips proved unsustainable. The company never raised external capital after its $50 million round from Z47 in Jan 2024. With no new funding, Aggarwal began leveraging his personal holdings in Ola Electric. According to a regulatory filing on Sept 10, he pledged 10.7 crore Ola Electric shares, about 2.4% of the company's equity, to raise debt for Krutrim.This latest disclosure, as others in recent times, underlines the direct linkage between Aggarwal's Ola Electric stake and Krutrim's survival. As Ola Electric's share price fell, Aggarwal reportedly added Rs 20 crores ($2.3 million) in cash to maintain collateral coverage. Krutrim, however, pushed back. In a statement to TOI, a spokesperson said, ""Krutrim remains well funded by the promoter and select investors as we execute on our AI strategy. In line with our focus on efficient capital deployment, we are building a leaner, more agile team that aligns with our evolving business priorities. ""The promoter has leveraged a fraction of his holdings to meet Krutrim's funding needs. Any attempt to link this to Ola Electric's share price is factually incorrect and a plain distortion."" Krutrim had about 250 R&D staffers across chip design, AI research, and cloud engineering. Today, most of that has unravelled.The chip team has been disbanded, with only a handful of engineers retained alongside Bodhi cofounder Sambit Sahu. AI head Chandra Khatri is set to leave this month, marking the exit of one of the last senior leaders.""A few months after Ola Electric's IPO, there was small trimming, about 40-50 layoffs,"" said another insider. ""By the time Kruti launched, most of the trouble resurfaced. Bhavish realised Krutrim doesn't have either the compute or the money to train AI models."" The company's consumer AI app, Kruti, was deemed ""a massive failure"" internally. With chips shelved and AI models beyond reach, only the cloud division remains, and even that is propped up by Ola. Ola Electric workloads have been migrated to Krutrim Cloud, with Ola Mobility expected to follow. ""The cloud business has no significant external client,"" one person said. ""It's become more of an ego project than a company.""Insiders described Aggarwal's commitment as relentless but increasingly personal. ""Money is directly going out of his pocket because there is no investor money at this point,"" said a former senior member. ""It's sad, given the opportunity in AI, that it has come to this.""The unravelling of Krutrim is also linked to the rising demands of Ola Electric, which listed in late 2024 in one of India's most closely watched IPOs. The EV business has since consumed Aggarwal's focus. Today, outside of the 150-person cloud team that serves Ola, Krutrim is a shell of its original form with AI research hollowed out, and semiconductors abandoned. For Aggarwal, the gamble to build India's homegrown AI-and-chips giant has collapsed into a cautionary tale of spreading too thin.","Krutrim, the ai venture founded by ola's bhavish aggarwal, is now largely sustained by his personal wealth and loans tied to his ola electric stake. ""the money that was raised from z47 (formerly matrix partners india) is long gone,"" said a senior executive familiar with the company's finances.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123908678,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-5736,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
