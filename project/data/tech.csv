US manufacturing remains unlikely

A big Wall Street analyst predicts Apple could manufacture up to 65% of its iPhones in India by fall 2025, as the tech giant navigates mounting pressure from President Trump to shift production away from the the country. Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives, who maintains a $270 price target and Outperform rating on Apple stock, called the Trump administration's 90-day tariff pause ""a dream scenario"" for the company. By this fall, Ives believes Apple ""could manufacture 60% to 65% of its smartphones in India,"" citing his ""high level of confidence"" that the iPhone maker is accelerating its manufacturing transfer to the South Asian country.The prediction comes amid escalating tensions between Apple and the Trump administration over the company's India operations. During a business event in Qatar, Trump revealed he confronted Apple CEO Tim Cook, stating: ""I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday. I said to him... I don't want you building in India.""Despite presidential pressure, Ives suggests Apple retains strategic options. The company ""could easily pivot back to a China driven iPhone strategy,"" he noted, with actions dependent ""on the tariff situation and deal negotiations.""Apple has reportedly reassured the Indian government there will be ""no change"" in its investment plans, even as Trump publicly urged the company to increase US. production. The tech giant manufactured approximately $22 billion worth of iPhones in India in the year ending March 2025, representing a 60% increase from the previous year.However, Ives dismisses the possibility of significant American iPhone production, stating there is ""no chance that iPhone production starts to happen in the US. in the near term.""

The Indian-American engineer Vaniya Agrawal who disrupted Microsoft's 50th anniversary celebrations in April this year again created disorder at another high-profile Microsoft event. In the latest incident, she disrupted Microsoft's ongoing developer event, Build 2025. Microsoft Build is the company’s annual developers conference. Vaniya Agrawal, along with another fired Microsoft employee Hossam Nasr, shouted at Microsoft’s head of security for AI, Neta Haiby.Haiby was co-hosting a Build session on best security practices for AI, alongside Sarah Bird, Microsoft’s head of responsible AI, when these two former Microsoft employees disrupted the talk to protest against the company’s cloud contracts with the Israeli government. This is the third day in a row that the Microsoft Build 2025 conference has been disrupted by Pro-Palestine protests.On Monday (May 19), shortly after Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella took the stage for his keynote address at the Build 2025 conference, an employee interrupted the speech. He started shouting “Free Palestine” and demanded accountability from the CEO for the company’s work with the Israeli government.Next day, on May 20, a Palestinian tech worker interrupted Microsoft executive Jay Parikh's keynote presentation, marking the second consecutive day of pro-Palestine protests at the event. ""Jay! My people are suffering!"" the protester shouted at Parikh, Microsoft's Executive Vice President of CoreAI, during his presentation on Azure AI technology. ""Cut ties! No Azure for apartheid! Free, free Palestine!"" Security personnel quickly escorted the demonstrator from the venue as he continued calling for Microsoft to end its contracts with the Israeli government.Earlier this year, Agrawal disrupted Microsoft’s 50th anniversary celebrations. As Microsoft current CEO Satya Nadella; and former CEOs Steve Ballmer and co-founder Bill Gates sat on stage talking about the company, Vaniya Agrawal stood up and started shouting. “Shame on you all. You’re all hypocrites,” she said. “50,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been murdered with Microsoft technology. How dare you. Shame on all of you for celebrating in their blood. Cut ties with Israel.” Vaniya was escorted out by the security.Microsoft has reportedly Blocked emails with certain words. According to a report in The Verge, ""Microsoft employees have discovered that any emails they send with the terms “Palestine” or “Gaza” are getting temporarily blocked from being sent to recipients inside and outside the company.""A software engineer in the company’s artificial intelligence division, Vaniya Agrawal publicly shared her resignation email last month. She sent the email to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and thousands of Microsoft employees following her protest at the company's 50th anniversary celebration on April 4. In the company-wide email, she wrote that she has been working with the company for over one-and-a-half years.Agrawal was fired shortly after the event. She was asked to go with immediate effect, without completing her two-week notice. The other protester, Ibtihal Aboussad, too was terminated for ""acts of misconduct"" following similar disruptions at the Microsoft Anniversary event.Vaniya Agrawal has been constantly sharing photos of protests around Microsoft Build 2025 venues.

MrBeast’s early life and how his career started

YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson , also known as MrBeast, has reportedly joined the ranks of billionaires, with Celebrity Net Worth estimating his net worth at $1 billion. This makes the 27-year-old content creator the eighth youngest billionaire globally, and the only one under 30 who built his wealth without inheritance. MrBeast began his YouTube career as a teenager, posting videos from his North Carolina home. His initial viral success came in 2017 with ""I Counted to 100,000,"" a video that took 44 hours to film and has since accumulated over 31 million views. Since then, he has gained recognition on the platform for his challenges, large-scale giveaways, and philanthropic content.In 2024, MrBeast was identified as a leading creator on the Forbes Top Creators list. While Forbes had previously estimated his net worth at $85 million, court documents from a 2024 lawsuit related to his food brand revealed his earnings were $223 million in 2023 and were projected to reach $700 million in 2024.His business ventures include Beast Burger , a delivery-only fast-food chain launched in 2020 that reportedly earned $2.3 million per month, though he later sued due to quality concerns. MrBeast also founded Feastables , a chocolate bar company that generated over $10 million in its initial months.Additionally, he co-created Juice Funds, a $2 million initiative with Creative Juice that invests up to $250,000 in emerging creators. In the crypto and tech space, MrBeast holds Bitcoin and several CryptoPunks NFTs and is involved with platforms like Coinbase, Refinable, and the XCAD Network, which helps creators monetise videos with NFTs.His philanthropic efforts are equally extensive, as he established Beast Philanthropy, a nonprofit supporting large-scale charitable projects. MrBeast has donated over 100 cars, given away $1 million in a single video, and helped raise $20 million to plant trees through Team Trees.In 2023, he faced criticism for funding cataract surgeries for 1,000 blind individuals. In response, MrBeast reiterated his commitment, stating, “I promise to give away all my money before I die. Every single penny.”He made a similar pledge in 2019, outlining his life’s goal as ""make a bunch of money, and then give it all away while doing as much good as possible.""MrBeast's achievements have earned him various industry accolades, including a nomination for Vlogger of the Year at the Shorty Awards in 2019 and wins for Breakout Creator and 2020 YouTuber of the Year.His journey from counting to 100,000 on camera to building a multi-billion-dollar empire showcases a blend of creativity and generosity. MrBeast's career trajectory began in 2012 when, at just 13 years old, he started uploading videos under the username ""MrBeast6000.""His early content included gaming videos, often featuring Minecraft and Call of Duty, as well as videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers. He also created reaction videos and funny compilations, showcasing his willingness to experiment with different formats.By mid-2016, his main channel on YouTube had fewer than 30,000 subscribers, but his persistence led him to drop out of college later that year to pursue YouTube full-time.His growth accelerated through diverse real-world formats, including challenges, vlogs, and absurd tasks like watching paint dry for an hour or attempting to break glass with a hundred megaphones. He gained initial popularity with his ""Worst Intros on YouTube"" series.MrBeast is known for reinvesting nearly all his video earnings back into creating new content, allowing for increasingly ambitious productions. In 2021, he was the fastest-growing creator on YouTube, adding 37 million subscribers in one year.He has also expanded his content globally by launching separate channels for dubbed videos in over 10 languages, including Spanish, French, and Arabic, leading to substantial international viewership. His main channel became the most-subscribed on YouTube in June 2024.In related news, MrBeast shared an invitation to Indian cricketer Virat Kohli. Shared on X during the Indian Premier League (IPL), the post rapidly went viral, accumulating nearly 600K views, a testament to Kohli's universal recognition. “@imVkohli Hey! Anyway I could get you in a video? 👀” he said in a post on X.","Jimmy donaldson, also known as mrbeast, has reportedly joined the ranks of billionaires, with celebrity net worth estimating his net worth at $1 billion.

As the tech giant pushes deeper into artificial intelligence, industry experts question the decision. Find out why even AI leaders weren’t safe from Microsoft’s sudden cuts.

To those also affected—you're not alone, we're at least 6,000, says Microsoft's fired AI director

Microsoft's second biggest layoffs ever hits over 6,000 employees



Microsoft announced last week that it is laying off approximately 6,000 employees, nearly 3% of its global workforce—in what marks the company's second-largest job reduction in its history. Among those affected was Gabriela de Queiroz , Director of Artificial Intelligence for Microsoft for Startups , who shared the ""bittersweet news"" of her departure on social media.""I was impacted by Microsoft's latest round of layoffs. Am I sad? Absolutely. I'm heartbroken to see so many talented people I've had the honor of working with being let go. These are people who cared deeply, went above and beyond, and truly made a difference,"" Gabriela de Queiroz wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter), alongside a picture of herself smiling.The layoffs come as Microsoft aggressively pushes into artificial intelligence, with CEO Satya Nadella revealing in April that AI now writes up to 30% of code in some Microsoft projects. Software engineers bore the brunt of the cuts, representing over 40% of the approximately 2,000 positions eliminated in Washington state alone, according to Bloomberg analysis.Despite being asked to stop work immediately and set an out-of-office message, Gabriela de Queiroz chose to stay longer. ""I chose to stay a little longer—showing up for meetings, saying goodbye, wrapping up what I could. That felt right to me,"" she explained in her social media posts.The irony of laying off an AI director while the company invests heavily in AI technology wasn't lost on industry observers. One Microsoft vice president recently told his team to use AI chatbots to generate half their computer code, up from the current 20-30%, before more than a dozen engineers on his team were subsequently laid off.""But if you know me, you know I always look at the bright side. I'm an optimist at heart. That hasn't changed. My smile, my gratitude, my belief that each day is a gift—that's all still here,"" Gabriela de Queiroz wrote, maintaining her positive outlook despite the circumstances.The cuts affect all levels, teams, and geographies as Microsoft streamlines operations and reduces management layers. ""What's next? I don't know yet. It's too soon to say. But I trust that something good will come out of this,"" Gabriela de Queiroz concluded, addressing fellow impacted employees: ""To those also affected—you're not alone. We are at least 6,000.""In another news, a Microsoft employee disrupted the company’s annual developer conference, Build 2025, in Seattle on May 19. The employee protested against the company’s Cloud and AI work with the Israeli government.Microsoft recently announced it will lay off 3% of its global workforce, affecting thousands of employees across all levels, teams, and geographies, amounting to over 6,000 employees. The cuts at the Redmond giant, which employed 228,000 people as of last June, aim to reduce management layers and streamline operations.In a related news, Microsoft's Build 2025 event faced disruption as an employee, Joe Lopez, protested against the company's contracts with the Israeli government, shouting slogans like 'Free Palestine'. This follows similar protests at Microsoft's 50th-anniversary celebrations. Lopez, a Microsoft Azure veteran, claims the company's technology aids in harming Palestinian civilians, a claim Microsoft denies.According to reports, the protesting employee was also joined by a fired Google employee who was part of last year’s sit-in protests against Google’s cloud contract with Israel.

"Tech layoffs 2025: Over 61,000 jobs cut as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and CrowdStrike reshape workforce",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tech-layoffs-2025-over-61000-jobs-cut-as-microsoft-google-amazon-and-crowdstrike-reshape-workforce/articleshow/121359700.cms,"Tech layoffs 2025: Over 61,000 jobs cut as Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and CrowdStrike reshape workforce

Tech Layoffs 2025: Over 61,000 jobs cut across more than 130 companies



Key stats (as of May 2025):

Total layoffs: 61,300+ employees

Companies involved: 130+

Sectors affected: Cloud computing, advertising, HR, devices, software engineering, sales

Microsoft: Streamlining leadership, prioritising engineers

Why Microsoft made the cuts:

Restructuring leadership layers to promote a flatter hierarchy

Investing more in engineering and product development

Optimizing global workforce by reducing duplication of roles

Google: Quiet workforce shifts behind the scenes

Strategic workforce realignment:

Focused layoffs across revenue-generating units

Elimination of redundant roles tied to aging product lines

A shift towards automation and generative AI technologies in advertising and consumer search

Amazon: Scaling back devices and emerging tech divisions

Behind Amazon’s cuts:

A realignment of priorities in consumer devices

Slower growth and usage rates of Alexa and Kindle platforms

Budget reallocation to cloud computing (AWS) and logistics optimization

CrowdStrike: Cutting 5% to focus on profitability

CrowdStrike’s layoff strategy:

Streamlining customer success and non-core support roles

Enhancing operating efficiency with AI-based threat detection tools

Reinvesting in international market expansion and enterprise sales

IBM: AI replaces jobs, but also creates new ones

IBM’s AI-driven workforce transition:

Use of AI automation in HR, reducing the need for traditional roles

Reinvestment in high-growth areas like quantum computing and hybrid cloud

Emphasis on reskilling and upskilling internal employees

Why are these layoffs happening? The 3 core reasons



1. Macroeconomic volatility

Global economic conditions remain unstable. Geopolitical tensions, high interest rates, and inflationary pressures have compelled tech companies to cut costs and bolster margins.

2. Post-pandemic growth corrections

During the COVID-19 pandemic, tech companies saw unprecedented growth and scaled their teams rapidly. As demand normalizes, many are right-sizing their workforces to match slower, more sustainable growth trajectories.

3. The AI revolution

Perhaps the most transformative factor is the rise of artificial intelligence. Tools like ChatGPT, Bard, and Copilot have already replaced or reduced the need for certain roles in coding, content creation, customer service, and HR. Companies are now prioritizing automation over expansion, leading to widespread redundancy across job functions that once required large teams.

What it means for the future of tech work

Emerging trends:

Fewer administrative layers, more direct reporting structures

Higher demand for AI literacy, even in non-technical roles

Greater reliance on contractors and fractional talent

Emphasis on remote and flexible work, with fewer full-time hires

Tech layoffs are defining the trajectory of the technology sector in 2025 — not solely due to innovation, but because of the sweeping workforce restructuring taking place across the industry. From global giants like Microsoft , Google , and Amazon to specialized cybersecurity firms such as CrowdStrike , companies are reducing headcounts in significant numbers. As of mid-May, more than 61,000 tech jobs have been cut across over 130 companies, according to data from Layoffs.fyi. Unlike previous downturns driven by financial collapses or market crashes, this wave is propelled by three powerful forces: slowing post-pandemic revenue growth, persistent global economic uncertainty, and, most notably, the rapid deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in core business operations.These layoffs signal a broader transformation in how tech firms are responding to modern pressures. Rather than merely cutting costs, many are strategically reorganizing their internal structures, accelerating AI-driven automation, and reallocating resources toward long-term innovation and profitability.According to the data from Layoffs.fri, as of May 2025, over 61,000 workers have been laid off in the tech industry — a continuation of a trend that began in 2022 and escalated dramatically in 2023. Companies are now more strategic in their announcements, often avoiding large headlines by issuing smaller, staggered job cuts throughout the year. Still, the cumulative effect has created deep uncertainty among tech professionals worldwide.The layoffs are not restricted to startups or mid-size firms; the biggest names in tech — Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and CrowdStrike — are among the most significant contributors to this tally. Let’s examine how each is navigating this reshuffling of talent and operations.In one of the largest individual cuts of the year, Microsoft laid off 6,000 employees, with nearly 2,000 roles eliminated in Washington state alone. This marked the company’s most substantial layoff since 2023. The job reductions span several business units, including support, administration, and middle management.According to an internal memo, the company is making these changes to “improve clarity of decision-making and better align teams with strategic priorities.” The layoff announcement also came with news of increased investment in AI-powered enterprise solutions and cloud infrastructure.While Google hasn't made a single large-scale layoff announcement in 2025, it has been silently trimming its workforce across multiple departments. In May alone, 200 employees were laid off from its Global Business Organization (GBO) — a team that handles advertising sales and partner engagement. These cuts follow earlier reductions in the Pixel hardware team, Android division, Chrome operations, and Google Cloud.Google’s restructuring is part of a broader initiative to recalibrate its business model in the face of AI-led disruption in search and advertising, two of its most lucrative verticals. Rather than hiring aggressively, the company is being more selective, favoring AI talent over traditional business development roles.Amazon announced in April that it would cut around 100 jobs in its Devices and Services division, which includes Alexa, Kindle, and Zoox — its autonomous vehicle subsidiary.Amazon has long treated its devices division as an innovation lab. However, as pressure mounts to deliver profitability in every business line, the company is scaling back on experimental divisions and concentrating on proven revenue drivers like AWS and Prime logistics.Even high-growth cybersecurity companies aren’t immune. CrowdStrike announced layoffs impacting 5% of its global workforce, citing a shift towards long-term profitability amid rising costs and market volatility.CrowdStrike's decision is especially noteworthy as cybersecurity remains one of the fastest-growing segments of the tech industry. Yet even here, automation and AI are allowing firms to do more with fewer people, reducing the need for large support teams.IBM represents a hybrid approach to workforce management in the age of AI. While the company laid off several hundred employees, mostly from HR and administrative roles, it also announced new hiring plans focused on engineering, programming, and enterprise sales.IBM CEO Arvind Krishna has been vocal about the company’s “AI-first” strategy, noting that while automation will eliminate certain roles, it will also create new demand for technical talent, especially in sectors where human insight remains essential.While the specifics vary by company, the underlying causes of the 2025 tech layoffs can be traced to three interwoven trends:The 2025 layoff wave is more than just a cost-cutting exercise — it is a strategic rebalancing of what work looks like in the digital economy. The shift isn’t just about reducing headcount; it’s about reshaping the types of roles that matter most.","Tech layoffs 2025: over 61,000 jobs cut as microsoft, google, amazon, and crowdstrike reshape workforce. Cloud computing, advertising, hr, devices, software engineering, sales affected. As of mid-may, more than 61,00 tech jobs have been cut across over 130 companies.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121360366,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-148498,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Xbox and PlayStation Price Hikes Explained

Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently highlighted a cost-cutting measure that suggests that the US federal government may be wasting about $100 million annually on inactive phone lines. Musk quoted a post by DOGE aka the Department of Government Efficiency which revealed that nearly 20% of the phone lines at a federal agency were unused. DOGE shared a post on X that reads “Unused phone lines! Of the 1048 @USOPM phone lines, 198 (19%) were either unused or duplicated.”It further added: “OPM (Office of Personnel Management) cancelled these lines (took 1 hour), resulting in ~$100k/yr in savings. Since OPM is ~0.1% of the federal government, this suggests that ~$100M/yr is wasted on unused lines”.The tech billionaire responded to the post, statingThe revelation could have broader implications for telecom providers supplying services to federal agencies. According to a 2023 Washington Post report, only 2% of U.S. adults use landlines exclusively. As legacy landline usage continues to decline—the cost and necessity of maintaining unused infrastructure is under increasing scrutiny.In 2019, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) repealed regulations that had previously required telecom providers to run copper landline connections to every home. The move marked a significant shift toward modernizing telecommunications infrastructure in favor of wireless and fiber-optic networks.According to a report, Verizon Communications Inc. remains the dominant landline service provider in the Northeastern United States, maintaining a strong regional presence even as overall landline use continues to decline nationwide.In a related news, Musk shared a 15-second clip of the US Vice President in conversation with Joe Rogan, where Vance said “You can say a lot of things about Elon Musk, but you can't say he's a dumb**s”. The two burst into laughter, as Rogan quipped, “You get dunked on by one of the smartest guys alive.”Musk shared the clip on his X timeline, responding with, ""Lmao,"" short for (Laughing My A** Off).",Tesla ceo elon musk recently highlighted a cost-cutting measure that suggests that the us federal government may be wasting about $100 million annually on inactive phone lines.

"CBS ordered to pay nearly $10 million to fired executive who called anchor 'too gay', blames ‘woke mob’ pressure",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/cbs-ordered-to-pay-nearly-10-million-to-fired-executive-who-called-anchor-too-gay-blames-woke-mob-pressure/articleshow/121369388.cms,"



CBS has been ordered to pay almost $10 million to a former top executive it dismissed before completing an internal investigation into allegations that he made racist and sexist remarks, reports New York Post.The remarks, according to court documents and his lawyer, included calling a Black anchor “a jive guy” and labelling another “too gay.” CBS allegedly acted under pressure from what the executive’s legal team called a “woke mob.”Peter Dunn, who served as president of CBS Television Stations, was removed in 2021 after the Los Angeles Times published a report accusing him of fostering a hostile work environment. The broadcaster suspended Dunn and another executive and began an internal review. However, Dunn was fired before the investigation was completed. At the time, CBS said the termination would be treated “as though without cause” but that the company could revisit the matter once the probe concluded.Months later, after completing its review, CBS attempted to reclassify Dunn’s dismissal as “for cause,” which would have allowed the company to withhold back pay and stock awards. That move led Dunn to pursue arbitration, where a panel of retired judges found the company had violated his employment contract.The appeals panel ruled CBS had no right to delay its decision on whether the firing was for cause. The contract required the company to make that determination at the time of dismissal, not retroactively. Arbitrators said the broadcaster could not invent a “new and nebulous third option” to defer its choice.CBS must now pay Dunn more than $7 million in compensation, plus interest, bringing the total to approximately $9.78 million.“This was never about Peter’s conduct. It was to appease the woke mob,” Dunn’s lawyer, Larry Hutcher, told The New York Post. “It was like the Red Scare, and it was very shortsighted and unfair.”CBS responded to the ruling by citing a procedural issue and insisted it disagrees with the outcome. “Four years ago, we removed Peter Dunn as head of the CBS Television Stations for reasons that have been well documented and reported publicly,” a spokesperson said. “This decision was not based on the substance of the allegations against Mr. Dunn.”Hutcher argued that CBS should have simply suspended Dunn and waited for the investigation to finish before making any decision about his employment. “The proper and prudent response would have been to suspend him, continue to pay him, wait for the investigation to be completed, and then fire him,” he said.He also noted that Dunn had spent more than 20 years at CBS and was focused on restoring his reputation. “We are grateful that the original arbitrator and the appeals panel agreed with Mr. Dunn that he had been wrongfully terminated,” Hutcher said. “We look forward to the award being confirmed in the Supreme Court so that we can enforce this judgment.”CBS maintains it stands by the findings of its investigation and the resulting decisions. “We’re grateful for the many voices who spoke up in a process that led to significant cultural change at our television stations,” the company added.","Peter dunn, who served as president of cbs television stations, was removed in 2021 after the los angeles times published a report accusing him of fostering a hostile work environment.

Walmart's standoff with Trump



Is Walmart firing linked with H-1B?







The H-1B row and India hatred on social media got fresh fuel after Walmart announced that it is set to lay off approximately 1,500 employees. The affected departments will be Walmart's technology unit, e-commerce fulfilment center and the advertising segment named Walmart Connect.US tech workers fuming over H-1B programs linked the firing with the H-1B and said it was strategically done to hire foreign nationals in those posts. ""Oh, guess what? The large layoffs today at Walmart are from its technology team. You know, the kind of US worker who's replaced by H1B,"" one wrote. Another user questioned, ""1500. Wow, that's a bloodbath. How many H-1Bs are they bringing in next year?""Some social media users suggested the move came a few weeks after Walmart was granted 3800 H-1B visas, though there is no evidence for the claim.One viral post shared the photo of Suresh Kumar, the Global Chief Technology Officer of Walmart and said that it's no coincidence that over 40 per cent of Walmart's IT department is H-1B hiring from India.A debate started whether Indians were also laid off as one Indian took to LinkedIn claiming that she had been impacted in the recent Walmart Global Tech restructuring. Social media users claimed that there must be a few Indians among the 1500 losing their jobs.The job cuts at Walmart come at a time when the retail major is locked in a battle with Trump over tariffs. Trump accused Walmart of taking advantage of customers and rebuked the for passing on the tariff to shoppers. ""Eat the tariff,"" Trump told Walmart asking them to absorb the impact of the tariffs.Walmart employs 1.6 million people in the country and more than 2.1 million globally. According to experts, H-1B could be one of the factors but AI is another. Walmart said it is cutting jobs in a bid to reduce expenses and streamline decision making. H-1B allows companies to hire foreign nationals for some skilled roles but they get less wages.","Us tech workers claim walmart is firing 1500 people to accommodate fresh h-1b hirings.

Donald Trump threatens 25% tariff on Apple — will other tech companies face the heat? Here’s what the US President said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/donald-trump-threatens-25-tariff-on-apple-will-other-tech-companies-face-the-heat-heres-what-the-us-president-said/articleshow/121369560.cms,"Donald Trump

In a fresh attack on overseas manufacturing, US President Donald Trump has warned Apple that iPhones not made in the United States could face a 25% tariff, and other smartphone makers like Samsung may not be spared either.Speaking on Truth Social and later to reporters at the White House, Trump said he expects Apple and its CEO Tim Cook to move production from countries like India back to the United States. “I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhone ’s that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,” he posted Friday. “If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the US.”He added in person, “It would be more. It would be also Samsung and anybody that makes that product. Otherwise it wouldn’t be fair.”Trump’s comments follow reports that Apple is planning to produce most of its US-sold iPhones in India. Cook had told investors during an earnings call earlier this month that “the majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin.”The warning comes after Trump met Cook in Riyadh last week and again at the White House on Tuesday.“I had a little problem with Tim Cook,” Trump said during a stop in Qatar. “I said to him, ‘Tim, you’re my friend. I treated you very good. You’re coming in with $500 billion.’ But now I hear you’re building all over India. I don’t want you building in India.”The move could have serious consequences for Apple and US consumers. Analyst Dan Ives from Wedbush Securities said it would cost the company roughly $30 billion and up to 10 years to fully move iPhone production to America. “The concept of Apple producing iPhones in the US is a fairy tale that is not feasible,” Ives said. He added that the cost of US-made iPhones could reach $3,500 if Apple replicated its Asian supply chain locally.Gene Munster from Deepwater Asset Management said Apple may not be able to absorb the cost of tariffs forever. “Anything below 30, they will probably carry the vast majority of that increase,” he explained. “But I think at some point they’re going to have to start to share it.”Apple has announced a $500 billion US investment plan to ease tensions, which includes building server facilities in Houston and expanding data centres in 20 states.Despite Apple’s efforts, Trump appears firm. “When they build their plant here, there’s no tariffs. So they’re going to be building plants here,” he said.Samsung, which mostly manufactures in South Korea, Vietnam, India, and Brazil, could also be hit. Although it moved out of China years ago, Trump insisted that all non-US phone production would face the same treatment. “It would be also Samsung and anybody that makes that product,” he said.Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent supported Trump’s call, saying the goal is to “bring back precision manufacturing to the US.” He also flagged concerns about the security of Apple’s semiconductor supply chain.","Us president donald trump has warned apple that iphones not made in the united states could face a 25% tariff.

TCS probes possible link to M&S cyber breach,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tcs-probes-possible-link-to-ms-cyber-breach/articleshow/121371467.cms,"TCS

MUMBAI: Tata Group's flagship software services company, TCS, is investigating whether it was the entry point for a cyberattack on UK retailer Marks and Spencer, the Financial Times reported on Friday. The breach occurred during the Easter weekend. TCS, which has worked with M&S for over ten years, aims to finish the probe by the end of the month. TCS did not comment on the report.The attack caused serious problems for M&S. The company was forced to shut down its online store for more than three weeks. This disruption reduced its market value by over 750 million pounds, or about Rs 8,295 crore. It could lead to a loss of up to 300 million pounds, around Rs 3,318 crore, in operating profit. Online services are expected to remain affected until July. UK police are also investigating the incident, the FT report said.&S CEO Stuart Machin stated that the problem was caused by human error, not a flaw in their systems or cyber defences. He mentioned that staff at a third-party contractor were tricked. He did not disclose if a ransom was paid or if TCS, which employs more than 6 lakh people, was the entry point.M&S began working with TCS in the early 2010s. In 2018, the retailer moved half of its tech work to TCS, designating it as its main tech partner. In 2023, they expanded their partnership to update all of M&S's tech systems. During the attack, at least two TCS employees' M&S login details were used in the breach. This attack is the latest to be linked to India's IT industry, increasing concerns about risks from outsourcing IT work to third parties.M&S is a key store on the UK high street and is trying to attract younger shoppers worldwide. It announced plans to strengthen its business and focus on good quality products. In India, M&S works with Reliance Retail. India is its biggest market outside the UK, with over 100 stores opened in the last 15 years. At M&S Reliance, a 51:49 joint venture between M&S and Reliance Retail, sales rose by 5% in FY24, reaching Rs 1,742 crore.","Tcs is investigating whether it was the entry point for a cyberattack on uk retailer marks and spencer.

The rejection rate stood at nearly 15%.In total, Indian applicants spent nearly Rs 916 crore on Schengen visa applications in 2024.Globally, more than 17 lakh applications were rejected across Schengen countries, generating a revenue of €145 million (Rs 1,410 crore) in fees from unsuccessful applicants. Indian applicants alone contributed €14 million (Rs 136.6 crore) to this amount.The high rejection rate and financial impact have raised concerns among Indian travelers, travel agents, and businesses, with many calling for more transparent and applicant-friendly visa procedures.Travel industry experts warn that these rejections not only affect individual plans but also hurt tourism, business travel, and academic mobility between India and the Schengen region.With the demand for Schengen visas from India at an all-time high, applicants are advised to plan well in advance, ensure complete documentation, and be mindful of stricter scrutiny, especially as appointment availability and processing times continue to tighten.","In 2024, more than 1.65 lakh schengen visa applications from india were denied.
