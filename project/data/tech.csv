NEW DELHI: With inflation at a record low of 0.3%, the food ministry has proposed lifting of export restrictions on wheat products such as aata, maida and sooji after a gap of nearly three-and-a-half years. In a letter to the commerce department, it has suggested considering allowing such exports of up to one million tonne (MT).Referring to the representation of Roller Flour Millers’ Federation of India to allow export of wheat products based on the “prevailing surplus and strong production outlook”, the ministry has sought “necessary action”.Sources said the Food Corporation of India (FCI) commenced the open market sale scheme (OMSS) of wheat for bulk buyers such as flour millers and this got a lukewarm response with around 70,000 tonne sold through e-action against the offer 2 lakh tonnes at Rs 2,550 per quintal. They added that this indicates enough wheat availability in the market and even the wholesale prices have dropped by around 12% compared to last year.At present, FCI has around 30.5 MT of wheat stock against the buffer requirement of 20.5 MT for Jan 1, 2026.Navneet Chitlangia, president of Roller Flour Millers’ Federation, said India has witnessed a bumper wheat harvest this season, and with a favourable monsoon, they anticipate yet another excellent harvest in the coming season.“In view of the robust domestic production, we have requested govt to lift the restrictions on wheat product exports so that India may reclaim its traditional markets across the globe,” he said.Before the export ban of wheat products, India used to send shipments of flour, maida and sooji and other products to Africa, Gulf and south Asian countries. In May, a ban was imposed on exports of wheat and its products due to concerns over domestic food security, drop in production, and rising inflation.","With inflation at a record low of 0.3%, the food ministry has proposed lifting of export restrictions on wheat products.

NEW DELHI: Millions of citizens going online will have guaranteed control over their digital data while social media companies such as Facebook and Instagram will need verifiable parental consent before onboarding children, or those under 18 years, with the govt finally notifying rules to operationalise the digital personal data protection (DPDP) law that was originally passed by Parliament in Aug 2023.The much-awaited rules promise a consent-based regime to safeguard the data of users who go online for social media, e-commerce, gaming, banking, payments and for availing of govt services.Companies and organisations violating the rules will face penalties, up to ₹250cr for serious failures to protect data, and breaches.The rules also require companies to quickly inform users and the new data protection board about any data breach. However, these rules will be implemented gradually.The govt has given companies an 18-month window for transition, considering the big back-end changes they will need to undertake. Any breach must be promptly informed in ""plain language, explaining the nature and possible consequences of the breach, the steps taken to address it, and contact details for assistance"", the govt said.It also said the law is guided by ""seven core principles"" - consent and transparency, purpose limitation, data minimisation, accuracy, storage limitation, security safeguards, and accountability.Regarding online data of children, where Big Tech and other major companies had been lobbying for a ""liberal"" approach, the new law mandates that companies must obtain verifiable consent before processing their personal data, with limited exemptions for essential purposes such as healthcare, education and real-time safety. ""For persons with disabilities who cannot make legal decisions even with support, consent must come from a lawful guardian. ""To obtain verifiable parental consent for processing a child's personal data, companies must adopt appropriate technical and organisational measures "".","The much-awaited rules promise a consent-based regime to safeguard the data of users who go online for social media, e-commerce, gaming, banking, payments and for availing of govt services.

Zoho Corporation founder and CEO Sridhar Vembu has responded to his company's messaging app Arattai falling out of the top 100 apps list, calling it a normal part of business development and dismissing critics as wasting their time. In an interview with ANI, Vembu addressed questions about WhatsApp testing a feature that would allow users to message people on other platforms.“There's nothing going wrong. I think, first of all, the idea that something went wrong is what is wrong. It is a normal course of events. Nothing goes straight to the moon. You have to go through these ups and downs,” Vembu was quoted as saying.He emphasised that companies that survive maintain a long-term perspective.“The trick to companies that survive is they have a long-term view on this. In fact, I never thought The number one is anything big. In fact, I literally told our employees, this is a particular moment, it won't last,” he added.“That's why I simply don't pay attention. And the people who pay attention and making fun of this, they are wasting their time. That's all I'll say. We are not wasting time. I am sitting and we are sitting and focused on code.So I said, don't worry about it,” Vembu noted, pointing out that Zoho views Arattai as a five to 15-year project rather than a short-term venture.Vembu revealed that Zoho has worked on messaging technology for 10 years, making the recent ranking drop insignificant.“Our strategy in all this, the messaging is very core. And we have been working on it for 10 years. So this one month is nothing for us. We will continue this and we have a really strong app. It's getting stronger,” the cofounder was quoted as saying.The company plans frequent updates to improve Arattai. Vembu argued that credible competition is necessary to prevent monopolistic practices in the messaging app market.“If we don't have competition, you can't keep the monopolist honest. The only thing that keeps a monopolist honest is competition,” he said.While talking about end-to-end encryption of chats on Arattai, Vembu noted that the encryption feature has been implemented, however, it will take some more time for the updates to take effect.","Vembu: zoho has long-term strategy for messaging app arattai.

The discussion started with Zuckerberg praising Huang’s role in powering the AI revolution. “It’s all you—you kind of made this happen,” Zuckerberg said, referring to Nvidia’s dominance in AI infrastructure.Responding to Zuckerberg, Jensen Huang said, “Why thank you… CEOs, we're delicate flowers,” poking fun at the need for appreciation even at the top.Along with this, the two tech leaders also joked about aging and appearances.“We’re pretty grizzled at this point,” Zuckerberg said. “I think we’re the two longest-standing founders in the industry.” Huang agreed, noting his gray hair while Zuckerberg commented on his curls.Huang founded Nvidia in 1993 with just the investment of $200. He launched the company on his 30th birthday which was later joined by co-founders Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. Nvidia started with a mission to advance 3D graphics. The breakthrough came in 1999 with the invention of the GPU, a technology that transformed computing.Fast forward to October 2025, Nvidia has entered the $5 trillion club. The chip maker managed to reach the market valuation of $5 trillion in just three months after crossing $ 4 trillion. This growth in Nvidia's market value suggest the escalating momentum in AI adoption across industries. Shares of Nvidia rose more than 4%, pushing its market capitalisation. Nvidia ranks ahead of Microsoft ($4 trillion) and Apple ($3.9 trillion), as well as Google parent Alphabet ($3.2 trillion), Amazon ($2.4 trillion) and Meta ($1.8 trillion).Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s journey started from his dorm room in Harvard in 2004, from where he started Facebook . He famously dropped out in 2005 to focus on the company, turning down his father’s offer to invest in a McDonald’s franchise. Today, Meta is valued at $1.6 trillion.","Nvidia ceo jensen huang and meta ceo mark zuckerberg took the stage for a candid and humours conversation.

Scale AI CFO pushes back: “We are alive and well”





Mark Zuckerberg unveils three new Meta AI smart glasses

Business is still booming





Moving ahead without Alexandr Wang





Facebook-parent Meta stunned the Silicon Valley in June this year by announcing a $14.3 billion investment in AI startup — Scale AI. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made this investment to primarily onboard Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang and other top executives of the company. This move by Meta trigged an immediate speculation about the Scale AI’s viability, with major clients like OpenAI, Google, and Elon Musk’s xAI reportedly pausing work with the startup. The industry insiders also felt that the company had been effectively acquired, leaving its future uncertain. However, after almost five months after the investment made by Meta, Scale AI CFO Dennis Cinelli has pushed back this speculation. Speaking to CNBC in an interview, Cinelli said that ‘We are a company that signed some of the best deals we have had in the history of our company, just in the last two or three months. We are not a Zombie.”Emphasising on the fact that Scale AI has signed some of its best deals in recent months, Cinelli told CNBC, “We’re not a zombie company,”. Along with this, he also dismissed the claims that the investment made by Meta was a licensing or acquihire deal.He emphasised that Scale AI is still an independent and completely operational.Founded in 2016, ScaleAI is known for its data-labelling services and custom AI applications for governments and enterprises. Cinelli told CNBC that both the divisions of the company are growing with revenue “well into the nine figures.” He also revealed that Scale AI recently secured two major contracts with the US Department of Defense which value $99 million and $100 million in August and September, respectively.Scale AI fired about 14% of its workforce in July, soon after Meta made the investment of $14.3 billion, but the company started the process of hiring and has hired 200 new employees. Along with this, the AI company is also working on expansion and is opening new offices in New York, Washington D.C., St. Louis, and London. Despite alls this, the San Francisco still remains the largest hub of the company where it is occupying 180,000 square feet of former Airbnb space.The departure of Alexandr Wang from the company was considered to a major loss. He was the world’s youngest self-made billionaire until October but Cinelli insists the “vast majority” of employees remain. Facebook-parent Meta now owns 49% stake in ScaleAIwhich is valued around $29 billion, but the company has no voting power or product integration. “Scale’s data business has grown every month since the Meta deal, and its applications business has doubled in the second half of 2025 compared with the first half. Scale expects the applications unit to be the primary revenue driver for the company in the future,” Cenelli told CNBC.",Scale ai cfo pushes back: “we are alive and well” facebook-parent meta made a $14.3 billion investment in ai startup scale ai.

SEBI’s advisory in digital gold



Read SEBI’s advisory here:



SEBI has enabled investments in gold and gold related instruments through various SEBI regulated gold products. These are exchange traded commodity derivative contracts, Gold Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) offered by Mutual Funds and Electronic Gold Receipts (EGRs) tradeable on stock exchanges. Investments in these SEBI regulated gold products can be made through SEBI registered intermediaries and are governed by the regulatory framework prescribed by SEBI.

It has come to the notice of SEBI that some digital/online platforms are offering investors to invest in ""Digital Gold/E-Gold Products'. Digital Gold is being marketed as an alternative for investment in physical gold.

In this context, it is informed that such digital gold products are different from SEBI regulated gold products as they are neither notified as securities nor regulated as commodity derivatives. They operate entirely outside the purview of SEBI. Such digital gold products may entail significant risks for investors and may expose investors to counterparty and operational risks.

Investors/ participants are made aware that none of the investor protection mechaims under securities market purview shall be available for investments in such Digital Gold/ E-Gold products.





Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath has now issued a cautionary note for the investors following SEBI’s recent advisory on digital gold. For those unaware, earlier this week SEBI issued a an advisory on digital gold calling it an unregulated and inefficient way to gain exposureto the precious metal. Now Kamath shared a post of social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) advising the users to not to go after digital gold and instead opt for the one of the safest and easiest ways — gold ETFs if they want to inset in gold. “Most people don’t realize that nobody regulates digital gold, and if something were to happen to the platforms or companies selling it, there’s not much you can do,” wrote Kamath.In a post shared on X, Kamath emphasised that digital gold is not regulated by any financial authority, which means that investors have limited recourse if the platforms selling it collapse or default. He noted that most buyers are unaware of this regulatory gap. “Most people don’t realize that nobody regulates digital gold, and if something were to happen to the platforms or companies selling it, there’s not much you can do,” Kamath wrote.Along with this, Kamath also pointed out the high upfront costs associated with digital gold purchases such as a 3% GST, plus 2–3% in spreads, which in tern means that the investors will lose another 6% immediately after buying digital gold, even before the regulatory risks kick in.Kamath also said that with Sovereign Gold Bonds going away, the only safest and easiest way to invest in gold is through gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “Now that Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) have stopped, gold ETFs remain one of the safest and easiest ways to get exposure to gold,’ Kamath.The remarks made by Kamath align with the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (SEBI) recent warning about the risks of investing in digital gold. SEBI cautioned that these products are not covered under its regulatory framework and urged investors to exercise due diligence.","Zerodha ceo nithin kamath has issued a cautionary note for the investors following sebi’s recent advisory on digital gold. ‘most people don’t realize that nobody regulates digital gold, and if something were to happen to the platforms or companies selling it, there's not much you can do,’ wrote kamath.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125291255,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-40120,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

How Apple positions iPhone Pocket in its product ecosystem





Retail experience and purchase process at launch









Apple and Japanese fashion house ISSEY MIYAKE have jointly introduced iPhone Pocket, a 3D-knitted textile accessory designed to be worn or carried and to hold an iPhone plus other small everyday items. The product is described as a “piece of cloth” reimagined as a flexible pocket: its ribbed, open-knit fabric expands to enclose a device and lets users glimpse the display when stretched. iPhone Pocket is available in two strap lengths and multiple colours, and Apple frames it as a special-edition accessory that complements iPhone design and personal style. The launch is positioned as both a fashion collaboration and a product engineered for universal fit and everyday utility.iPhone Pocket is a singular, 3D-knitted construction developed by ISSEY MIYAKE in close collaboration with Apple Design Studio. Crafted in Japan, the textile draws inspiration from the brand’s iconic pleats and is intended to function as an additional, wearable pocket for iPhone and other “pocketable items” such as AirPods. The knit’s ribbed open structure allows the textile to expand and subtly reveal contents when stretched, while fully enclosing items when relaxed.Apple and ISSEY MIYAKE describe the material as engineered for both look and function, combining traditional craft with modern textile R&D.iPhone Pocket is a singular, 3D-knitted construction developed by ISSEY MIYAKE in close collaboration with Apple Design Studio.

The knit’s ribbed open structure allows the textile to expand and subtly reveal contents when stretched, while fully enclosing items when relaxed. Apple and ISSEY MIYAKE describe the material as engineered for both look and function, combining traditional craft with modern textile R&D.According to Apple, the iPhone Pocket is sized and structured to fit any iPhone model as well as small everyday items. The open knit expands to accommodate slightly bulkier contents and lets users peek at the iPhone display without removing the phone fully. Apple highlights multiple ways to use the accessory: handheld, attached to a bag, or worn on the body. The product is positioned as a fashion accessory as much as a utility item, emphasising styling and personal expression alongside practical carrying.Apple’s Newsroom states the iPhone Pocket was crafted in Japan and that its development and design unfolded through collaboration between ISSEY MIYAKE’s research and development teams and Apple Design Studio. The piece references ISSEY MIYAKE’s longstanding practice of pleating and textile innovation as the inspiration for the accessory’s knit structure. Apple quotes design leads from both organisations to underline the shared approach to simplicity, craftsmanship and adaptability.Apple positions iPhone Pocket as both fashion and function: the open knit and colour palette were explicitly selected to mix and match with iPhone finishes and to let users create personal combinations. Apple images show Pocket paired with iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone Air models in complementary colours. Practical use cases emphasised by Apple include carrying the iPhone and small items together, wearing the Pocket across the body for hands-free use, and tying it to other bags or accessories. Retail staff will assist customers in stores in selecting strap length and colour combinations.Apple’s announcement emphasises the crafted textile quality and the 3D-knitted construction, but does not publish a formal care guide in the Newsroom piece. Because iPhone Pocket is a textile accessory made in Japan using ISSEY MIYAKE’s knit techniques, consumers should expect typical fabric care considerations gentle handling, avoiding sharp objects, and following any care instructions included in product packaging or on Apple’s online product pages after purchase. For definitive care and warranty details, customers should consult Apple’s product page or in-store specialists at launch.Apple frames iPhone Pocket as a special-edition accessory that complements iPhone design language and expands how users carry and style their devices. The product is intended to sit alongside Apple’s existing accessory portfolio rather than replace protective cases: it emphasises wearability, textile design, and aesthetic pairing. Apple highlights the accessory’s ability to carry other small items (for example, AirPods) and to visually coordinate with iPhone finishes.Apple’s announcement lists the specific Apple Store locations where iPhone Pocket will be available at launch and notes that both online and in-store purchase options will be offered beginning November 14, 2025. Apple Specialists will help customers mix and match lengths and colours with their iPhone and demonstrate styling options. Customers outside the initial launch markets should monitor apple.com for availability updates.","Iphone pocket is a 3d-knitted textile accessory designed to be worn or carried and to hold an iphone plus other small everyday items.

Google has announced a $40 billion investment in Texas through 2027, marking one of its largest US infrastructure commitments to date. The funds, the company said will go toward building new cloud and AI infrastructure, including new data center campuses in Armstrong County and Haskell County. Google CEO shared an online post, announcing the investment. “Today, we're announcing a new $40B investment in Texas through 2027 to build Cloud & AI infrastructure and support thousands of new jobs,” he wrote in the post.“This includes new data centers in Armstrong and Haskell Counties and a major investment to strengthen energy resilience and abundance. We're also providing funding to more than double the projected pipeline of new Texan electricians to power the AI era,” he added.“We've proudly called Texas home for 15 years. Thank you @GregAbbott_TX for your continued support,” Pichai continued.As part of the $40 billion investment, Google said it will continue its approach of growing infrastructure responsibly, which includes adding new clean energy resources to the Texas grid and covering the costs tied to its operations. The company also announced a new $30 million Energy Impact Fund to help scale community energy-efficiency projects across the state.Google also confirmed it has secured more than 6,200 megawatts of new energy generation and capacity through power-purchase agreements with energy developers. One of the new Haskell County data centers will be built alongside a solar and battery storage plant, reinforcing the company’s push toward cleaner, more reliable energy resources.In order to support construction of the new facilities, Google will help expand Texas’ pool of skilled electrical workers.
