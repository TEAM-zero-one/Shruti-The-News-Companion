Why Shaq needed a custom-built car

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu may have just told techies how AI cannot take away all their jobs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zoho-founder-sridhar-vembu-may-have-just-told-techies-how-ai-cannot-take-away-all-their-jobs/articleshow/119411425.cms,"90% of coding tasks

Read Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu’s complete post here

When people say ""AI will write 90% of the code"" I readily agree because 90% of what programmers write is ""boiler plate"".

There is ""essential complexity"" in programming and then there is a lot of ""accidental complexity"" (that is the boiler plate stuff) and this is very old wisdom from the Mythical Man Month.

AI is doing a great job eliminating the accidental complexity. Humans still needed to deal with the essential complexity.

In essence, AI can make mincemeat of patterns already discovered (by humans). Can it find totally new patterns? As with humans, that is much rarer and a quality known as ""taste"" or ""knowing where to dig"" or ""follow a hunch or conviction all the way"" is needed to discover new patterns. I don't know if AI can do this. I don't know if that can be brute forced.

50% of code

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has shared his insights on the impact of artificial intelligence (AI) on the software industry, emphasising that while AI can automate repetitive coding tasks, it cannot entirely replace human expertise. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Vembu addressed the growing concerns about AI taking over jobs, offering a balanced perspective on the capabilities and limitations of AI.Vembu acknowledged that AI is capable of handling up to, particularly those involving ""boilerplate"" or repetitive code. However, he stressed the importance of human involvement in addressing ""essential complexity""—the core engineering challenges that require creativity, intuition, and problem-solving skills.""AI can make mincemeat of patterns already discovered by humans. Can it find totally new patterns? That is much rarer and requires qualities like 'taste' or 'knowing where to dig,'"" Vembu wrote, highlighting the unique abilities of humans in discovering new solutions.Vembu's remarks come at a time when AI is reshaping the software development landscape, with industry leaders like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicting a reduction in demand for software engineers. Altman has noted that AI is already responsible for generating overin many companies, and the trend is expected to grow.Despite these advancements, Vembu believes that human expertise will remain indispensable for tackling complex challenges and driving innovation. Vembu's comments underscore the need for a balanced approach to AI integration, where automation complements human creativity rather than replacing it.","Zoho founder sridhar vembu has shared his insights on the impact of artificial intelligence (ai) on the software industry.

Hyundai announces record $20 billion investment in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/hyundai-announces-record-20-billion-investment-in-us/articleshow/119452125.cms,"Trump: 'Tariffs very strongly work'

'More investments, more jobs, and more money'

South Korea’s Hyundai has unveiled a massive $20 billion investment in US manufacturing , including a $5 billion steel plant in Louisiana, marking the company’s first steel production facility in the country. The announcement was made on Monday at the White House, alongside US President Donald Trump, Hyundai chairman Euisun Chung, and Louisiana governor Jeff Landry.The $5.8 billion Louisiana plant, which will produce over 2.7 million metric tonnes of steel annually, is expected to create more than 1,400 jobs and supply steel to Hyundai’s auto plants in Alabama and Georgia.Chairman Chung called it the auto giant’s largest US investment ever.Hyundai's announcement comes as more global firms ramp up US investments amid tariff concerns. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, Japan’s SoftBank, and Apple have all announced major expansion plans in the country. Apple recently pledged $500 billion to boost manufacturing and infrastructure across the US.Speaking at the White House, Trump linked the investment to his trade policies, saying, ""This investment is a clear demonstration that tariffs very strongly work."" His administration had previously introduced 25% tariffs on steel and aluminium imports and planned new levies on Asian and European car imports, set to take effect next month.Hyundai’s Euisun Chung acknowledged Trump’s role in the company’s decision, revealing that discussions about the US steel plant began in 2019 during a meeting in Seoul. He added that the announcement coinciding with Trump's second term made the moment ""even more special,"" CNN reported.White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt praised the development on social media, writing, ""More investments, more jobs, and more money in the pockets of hardworking Americans – all thanks to President Trump’s economic policies.""While such investment pledges are common during new presidential terms, their success varies. Trump’s 2017 announcement of a $10 billion Foxconn factory in Wisconsin, expected to create 13,000 jobs, ultimately resulted in a scaled-down investment of $672 million, producing fewer than 1,500 jobs.Despite Trump's push to ""save"" the US auto industry, American factories already produce the majority of North American auto production. In 2023, US assembly plants built 10.2 million vehicles, compared to 4 million in Mexico and 1.3 million in Canada.With Trump’s next wave of tariffs set for 2 April, more companies are expected to shift production to the US to avoid trade penalties.","South korea's hyundai unveils $20 billion investment in us manufacturing, including a $5 billion steel plant in louisiana.

"Payments body writes to PM Modi, seeks MDR on UPI for large merchants and RuPay debit cards",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/payments-body-writes-to-pm-modi-seeks-mdr-on-upi-for-large-merchants-and-rupay-debit-cards/articleshow/119452183.cms,"MUMBAI: The Payments Council of India (PCI) which represents digital payments companies has written to Prime Minister Narendra Modi, seeking introduction of merchant discount rate (MDR) on UPI transactions and RuPay debit cards. The industry body has sought an MDR of 0.3% on UPI transactions only for large merchants and a nominal MDR on RuPay debit cards for all merchants. “This approach aligns with existing MDR structures for other digital payments instruments such as credit cards and non RuPay debit cards,” PCI said in a statement on Monday.MDR is a fee charged by banks to merchants for providing digital payment services. The government last week approved a lower Rs 1,500 crore incentive scheme for the current financial year to promote low-value BHIM-UPI transactions, focusing on payments made to merchants. The allocation was half of the over Rs 3,000 crore subsidy in FY24. PCI in the letter said that the Rs 1,500 crore allocation covers only a fraction of the estimated Rs 10,000 crore annual cost required to maintain and expand UPI services. “MDR is the lifeline of the digital payments ecosystem. Without it, the sustainability of the entire infrastructure is at risk. The introduction of a reasonable MDR for large merchant transactions will allow the industry to continue investing in innovation, cybersecurity, grievance redressal, and merchant support, ultimately ensuring that UPI continues to thrive,” PCI said in its submission. About six crore merchants in India currently accept digital payments of which 90% are categorised as small merchants with around 50 lakh merchants categorised as large enterprises.Introduction of MDR on UPI merchant transactions has been a long pending demand of the fintech and broader payments industry which said that a zero MDR regime would render the system unsustainable.

When should you exit an investment? Top things to keep in mind,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/investing/when-should-you-exit-an-investment-top-things-to-keep-in-mind/articleshow/119410980.cms,"Here are key scenarios where exiting an investment may be advisable. (AI image)

By Sandeep Walunj

""If the job has been correctly done when a common stock is purchased, the time to sell it is – almost never."" – Philip Fisher

""You may not know when to start but must know when to stop!""

Here are key scenarios where exiting an investment may be advisable:

1. Achievement of Goals

Did you invest with a clear goal—retirement, buying a house, or funding education? If so, exit when the goal nears.

Shift to less volatile asset classes as the exit date approaches to minimize risks.

2. Profit Booking

Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio – If significantly above historical or sector averages, it may indicate overvaluation. Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio – A high ratio may signal overvaluation relative to intrinsic worth. Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis – If the stock price has reached its fair value based on future cash flows, exiting may be prudent.

Reinvest proceeds wisely and consider tax implications.

During a market rally, sell in tranches to secure gains while retaining exposure.

3.

Stop-Loss Strategy

A stop-loss order sets a predetermined exit point to limit losses.

Example: If a stock is bought at ₹100 with a 10% stop-loss, sell it at ₹90, preventing larger losses.

Set stop-loss levels based on investment type—example 5-15% for volatile stocks, 15-25% for stable blue-chip stocks—aligned with your risk tolerance.

4. Underperformance

Mutual Funds – If it lags behind category peers and benchmarks persistently.

Stocks – Red flags include:

Declining revenues and profits. Rising debt levels. Loss of market leadership. Governance issues (e.g., fraud, regulatory troubles).



5. Portfolio Rebalancing

A well-diversified portfolio needs periodic rebalancing.

If an asset class grows disproportionately large, reduce exposure and reinvest in underweighted assets.

Example: If equities surge, selling some stocks and reallocating to bonds can maintain balance.

6. Market and Economic Conditions

Rising Interest Rates – Sectors like real estate and capital-intensive industries may underperform in this scenario.

Recession Indicators – An inverted yield curve or declining consumer spending may warrant exiting cyclical stocks.

Regulatory Changes – New laws, tax policies, or sectoral regulations can impact profitability.

Behavioural Biases That Delay Exit Decisions

Loss Aversion – Refusing to sell at a loss, hoping for recovery instead of reallocating capital.

Confirmation Bias – Ignoring negative signals and focusing only on positive news.

Anchoring Bias – Fixating on past high prices and resisting selling below that level.

"Gratuity eligibility, payout and formula: Leaving job before 5 years? Here’s how you can still get gratuity",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/financial-literacy/savings/gratuity-eligibility-payout-and-formula-leaving-job-before-5-years-heres-how-you-can-still-get-gratuity/articleshow/119248440.cms,"Gratuity payment calculations are governed by specific guidelines outlined in the Payment of Gratuity Act. (AI image)

How is gratuity payment calculated? Formula explained

The calculation method is: (15X Final drawn salary X Service duration)/26

The computation would be: (15X40,000X5)/26.

The gratuity amount due to Mis X is Rs 1,15,384.61, rounded to Rs 1,15,385.

For staff not under the Payment of Gratuity Act's purview:

The computation for his gratuity proceeds as: (15X40,000X6)/30.

The final gratuity amount that Mr X shall receive is Rs 1,20,000.

Salaried employees quite often have gratuity as a component of their CTC (cost to company). The Payment of Gratuity Rules, 1972, stipulates that staff members become entitled to gratuity after completing five years of uninterrupted service with an organisation. But, did you know that you can qualify for gratuity payout before completing five years, provided they serve beyond a particular duration.According to an ET report, experts say that employees qualify for gratuity upon completing 4 years and 240 days with an organisation. For example, if someone began working at an organisation on January 1, 2021, they would be eligible for gratuity upon leaving after August 29, 2025. This eligibility occurs because they would have served 4 years and 240 days by then, although their five-year milestone would only be completed by January 1, 2026.This provision exists because of how continuous service is defined in the Payment of Gratuity Act Puneet Gupta, Tax Partner, EY India, told ET, ""Section 4(1) of the Payment of Gratuity Act says that gratuity will be payable if an employee has rendered a minimum continuous service of five years. Section 2A of the Payment of Gratuity Act defines continuous service. Section 2A(2) of the Gratuity Act defines the deemed-to-be in continuous service. An employee is deemed to be in continuous service for one year if an employee during the 12 preceding calendar months has worked under the employer for not less than 190 days or 240 days, as the case may be.""Also Read | Tax planning before March 31 deadline? Tax saving fixed deposits with high interest rates - check list According to the Payment of Gratuity Act, employees working in underground mines or establishments operating fewer than six days weekly must complete 190 days, whilst others need 240 days. When an employee completes more than 240 days in the fifth year, they are considered to have completed an additional year of service, totalling five years, thus becoming eligible for gratuity.Saraswathi Kasturirangan, Partner at Deloitte India explains that an employee on payroll becomes eligible for gratuity payment upon completing 4 years and 240 days of service when leaving the organisation. The 240-day period is equivalent to 7.89 months. Therefore, workers should ensure their tenure extends to 4 years and 8 months to qualify for gratuity benefits upon resignation or retirement, she says. Consequently, staff members whose continuous service falls short of 4 years and 240 days, for instance, those departing after 4 years and 6 months or 4 years, 6 months and 1 day, cannot claim gratuity benefits, she notes.The requirement of five years' continuous service is waived if the employee's service ends due to death or disablement.Gratuity payment calculations are governed by specific guidelines outlined in the Payment of Gratuity Act. The calculation method varies depending on whether employees fall under the Act's purview or not.Also Read | Gold prices at record high! Have yellow metal prices peaked? Check these 5 charts before putting more money in gold The Act's applicability is determined by the organisation's workforce size. If an organisation has employed 10 or more people on any single day within the previous 12 calendar months, it comes under the Act's jurisdiction. Once covered, the organisation remains subject to the Act even if staff numbers subsequently decrease below 10.For staff members covered by the Payment of Gratuity Act, the payment is calculated using 15 days of their final drawn salary for each full year of service, including any period exceeding six months.The final drawn salary encompasses basic pay, dearness allowance and sales commission, as stipulated in the Act.Consider Miss X who has served an organisation (with a six-day work week) for 4 years and 300 days. Her eligibility for gratuity payment is confirmed as her service exceeds 4 years and 240 days. With a final basic salary of Rs 40,000, the 300 days convert to 9.863 months. For gratuity calculations, when excess months exceed 6 (9 months here), it counts as one complete year.Also Read | New TDS rules from April 1, 2025: Check new tax deduction limits for FD interest, MFs and lottery wins Gratuity remains payable even when organisations aren't covered by the Payment of Gratuity Act. In such instances, the gratuity is calculated as half a month's salary per completed service year, disregarding any incomplete year (months less than a year) in the calculation.The gratuity calculation follows this equation: (15 X Last drawn salary X Number of years of completed service)/30.Consider a scenario where Mr X has served an organisation (not under the Act's purview) for 6 years and 7 months. His final basic salary stands at Rs 40,000, and the organisation opts to provide him with gratuity.",Gratuity payment calculations are governed by specific guidelines outlined in the payment of gratuity act.

Ben & Jerry’s argued this decision violated the terms of its merger agreement, which requires consultation with an advisory committee from its board before any CEO can be removed.Unilever, headquartered in London, responded on Wednesday, expressing disappointment over the public nature of the dispute.“Regrettably, despite repeated attempts to engage the board and follow the correct process, we are disappointed that the confidentiality of an employee career conversation has been made public,” the company said in a statement.Unilever acquired Ben & Jerry’s in 2000 for $326 million, with the ice cream brand hoping the partnership would strengthen its social mission. However, tensions between the two companies have escalated in recent years.In 2021, Ben & Jerry’s announced it would no longer sell its products in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. The following year, Unilever sold its Israeli operations to a local company, which continued selling Ben & Jerry’s under its Hebrew and Arabic branding across Israel and the West Bank.Unilever has since revealed plans to spin off its entire ice cream division, including Ben & Jerry’s, by the end of 2025 as part of a wider restructuring. The consumer goods giant also owns brands such as Dove soap and Hellmann’s mayonnaise.The strained relationship took another hit last November when Ben & Jerry’s sued Unilever in a New York federal court, accusing it of attempting to silence the company’s statements supporting Palestinians in the Gaza war.The complaint also alleged that Unilever blocked Ben & Jerry’s from posting about issues it expected to be challenged in a potential second term for Donald Trump, including minimum wage policies, universal healthcare, abortion rights, and climate change.Tuesday’s filing marked an amendment to that ongoing lawsuit, further expanding the gap between the ice cream brand and its parent company.","Ben & jerry's accuses its parent company, unilever, of unlawfully removing its ceo.

Indian airline IndiGo announced plans on Wednesday to increase its international flight capacity by fiscal year 2030 in an effort to capture a larger market share.The no-frills carrier intends to raise its international capacity share—measured as the proportion of total available seat kilometres dedicated to international routes—from the current 28% to 40%, news agency Reuters reported. This shift marks a significant growth from just 14% in fiscal year 2018, achieved in a span of seven years.IndiGo currently flies to 40 international destinations and holds a 19% share of India’s international flight market, according to the latest data from the country’s aviation regulator. Following the announcement, shares of the airline rose by 4.2%.This international expansion comes as IndiGo seeks to diversify beyond its dominant domestic market, where it holds nearly 60% of the share. The move aligns with the broader trend of Indian carriers working to meet the growing demand for both domestic and international air travel, despite challenges related to aircraft supply.Earlier this year, IndiGo revealed plans to strengthen its international presence, which currently generates around 10% of its revenue. The airline also announced plans to lease a Boeing 787-9 Dreamliner from Norse Atlantic Airways to expand its long-haul operations.IndiGo is looking to add business class seats to its Airbus A321XLR and A350 aircraft to further increase revenue, as business class tickets are priced roughly three times higher than economy class.The airline began offering business class seats on select domestic routes late last year, marking its first move away from an all-economy cabin model, and is positioning itself to capitalize on the growing demand for premium travel among Indian passengers.IndiGo also reaffirmed its goal of expanding its fleet to over 600 aircraft by 2030, up from approximately 437 currently.","Indian airline indigo plans to increase its international flight capacity by fiscal year 2030.

Santander UK's announcement on Wednesday that it plans to shut a fifth of its branch network has raised concerns about the bank's future in the UK. The move, which could result in around 750 job losses consist of the closure of 95 out of 444 branches by June.The bank which has faced speculation over its long-term presence in the UK, will retain 349 branches, including 290 full-service locations and 36 branches with reduced hours. Like many other UK banks, Santander has been scaling back its physical presence as customers increasingly turn to digital banking, reported news agency Reuters.Since 2019, the bank has reported a 63% rise in digital transactions, while in-branch financial transactions have declined by 61% over the same period. Despite this, the closures have sparked criticism from UK lawmakers, who argue that they harm local businesses and make it more difficult for vulnerable customers in rural areas to access banking services.In response to these concerns, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) introduced new rules in September to make it more difficult for banks to close branches without ensuring that customers have free access to cash alternatives.Santander UK explained that the decision to close branches was part of its strategy to align with customer behaviour. ""As a business, we must move with customers and balance our investment across all the places where we interact with them,"" said the bank. ""Closing a branch is always a very difficult decision, and we spend a great deal of time assessing where and when we do this and how to minimize the impact on our customers.""The bank added that it is consulting with employee unions and will provide support to affected staff, including assistance with finding alternative roles within the bank.In its most recent financial report, Santander UK posted a 38% drop in annual pre-tax profit, totalling £1.33 billion ($1.73 billion) in 2024. The bank employs approximately 18,000 people.Despite reports in January suggesting that Barclays had explored a potential offer for Santander UK's operations, the parent company reiterated last month that its UK unit remains a key part of its globally diversified business strategy and is not for sale.","Santander uk plans to close 95 out of 444 branches by june.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New york-based air company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol. Carbon capture and utilization, or ccu, could be an important tool in the fight against climate change. But the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-633411,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
