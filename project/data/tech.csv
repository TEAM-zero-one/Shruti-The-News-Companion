New Delhi: IIM Ahmedabad’s move to establish its first international campus in Dubai marks a bold step toward global leadership in management education. Director Professor Bharat Bhasker speaks exclusively with the TOI on tailored programmes, strategic partnerships, and cutting-edge pedagogy, and the institute's aim to serve regional needs while reinforcing its vision of shaping future-ready leaders through a globally competitive curriculum.As the first programme, the IIMA Dubai Campus will offer a full-time One-year MBA that is designed to cater to the advanced management learning and upskilling needs of global working professionals and entrepreneurs. As we grow our Dubai Campus, we plan to offer more programmes, including Open Enrolment and Customised Executive Education Programmes.Dubai and surrounding regions has nurtured not only regional but several international industry leaders, multinational corporations, and high-growth startups as well. The ambitious executives officers in these organisations look for quality management education which can add value to their careers and help their organisations grow. By establishing our presence there we aim to provide world-class management education to these aspiring business leaders from the region and help them build their professional career. With the UAE's ambitious economic development goals, we believe that IIMA's programmes will further enhance the supply of managerial talent pool essential for accelerating growth in the region.With its ambitious economic agenda and a supportive ecosystem for innovation and prosperity, Dubai serves as a valuable source of talent and resources for IIM Ahmedabad to enhance the regional economy. IIMA has a well-established alumni network in the area and has been offering certificate executive education programmes in Dubai for over 15 years. Our international expansion is driven by the robust bilateral ties between the Indian and UAE governments. IIMA's presence will enable India to extend its strong institutions globally, contributing to the economic prosperity of our partner nations.Case-based pedagogy is one of the cornerstones of learning and research at IIMA. In fact, we were the pioneer to introduce it in India. Our newly formed Madan Mohanka Centre of Excellence in Case Method of Learning shall promote research, teaching, training, knowledge building and related activities in the area of case method of learning. In particular, it will coach faculty and others for excelling as case instructors, support for developing cases, do research on case pedagogy, propagate case methodology through conferences, workshops, short-term Faculty Development Programmes, and other related activities.IIMA strives to uphold its academic rigour and exceptional training practices that transform young minds into an industry-ready talent pool that can not only enrich businesses but also actively contribute to the economic growth of the country and the world. We aim to make our curriculum and educational practices contemporary and global. Keeping the dynamic nature of the industry in mind, we continuously revise our curriculum to include contemporary business practices. With digital technology coming to the centre stage of businesses and industries, our curriculum is also keeping pace with current trends of emerging technologies for managing successful businesses.We have been working closely with the industry, government bodies, and policy think tanks, which allows us to take a closer look at their requirements. This makes a huge difference as we integrate these learnings into our courses and teaching-learning methodologies to ensure that our students are trained as per current and future industry demands.The Centres of Excellence established at our Institute play a crucial role in enhancing our curriculum through research initiatives. These Centres provide valuable insights into industry trends, challenges, opportunities, and requirements, enriching the learning experience. Additionally, they serve as a bridge between our students and the industry, offering them the chance to engage in immersive projects that significantly contribute to their development as industry-ready leaders. For example, our Brij Disa Centre for Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (CDSA) had worked on a report titled “Labour-force Perception about AI - A Study on Indian White-collar Workers”, studied the awareness and usage of AI among white-collar workers, their perception of its implications on the future of jobs and careers, and their readiness to adopt AI technology. This report is amongst the earliest studies of the topic and provides critical input for informed policymaking, strategic planning, and effective workforce development initiatives. The results of the Business Inflation Expectations Survey ( BIES ) published by our Misra Centre for Financial Markets and Economy are frequently referred by the RBI and the Finance Ministry in policy-making.IIMA’s signature Case Study Method enables students to step into the shoes of company leaders and come up with strategies and solutions that are best suited to a particular scenario. This experiential way of knowledge and learning better prepares students in managerial skills.","Iima director bharat bhasker speaks exclusively with the toi on tailored programmes, strategic partnerships, and cutting-edge pedagogy.

In the debut episode of her new podcast The Pre-Game, Kayla reflected on how dating high-profile men led to toxic dynamics and emotional pain, ultimately pushing her to change how she approaches love and relationships.Kayle Nicole admitted that the experience of dating someone in the public eye came with a price constant scrutiny, unsolicited opinions, and being dragged into media storms she never asked for. After her split from Kelce in 2022, the situation escalated when Travis Kelce began dating Taylor Swift.

Travis wasn’t only one. But the aftermath of that relationship taught me to put myself first.""Now, she’s taking a different path, one that prioritizes privacy, peace, and emotional safety. She stated she’s no longer interested in making her romantic life public, joking that she's now “dating and hiding.” She won’t reveal who she’s with unless she’s married and has a family.

Similarly, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt acquired a $15 million Georgetown home once occupied by Jacqueline Kennedy.

Former eBay executive Jeff Skoll spent $17 million on Virginia properties reportedly planned for a compound.

Mark Zuckerberg has become the latest tech billionaire to establish a presence in Washington DC, purchasing a $23 million mansion in the upscale Woodland Normanstone neighborhood, a report has said. The acquisition, confirmed by Facebook parent company Meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.Politico reports that for weeks, the identity of the buyer remained shrouded in mystery as real estate agents were bound by non-disclosure agreements. Shortly after the cash transaction closed in early March, images of the 15,000-square-foot property became pixelated on Google Maps, the report added.Neighborhood residents noted increased activity at the previously vacant home, coinciding with reports that Zuckerberg’s private jet had landed at Dulles Airport.The publication says that a Meta spokesperson confirmed the purchase, explaining: “Mark and Priscilla have purchased a home in DC, which will allow Mark to spend more time there as Meta continues the work on policy issues related to American technology leadership.”The official explanation cites convenience and safety during increased Washington visits. Notably, Zuckerberg also has properties in Palo Alto, Lake Tahoe and Hawaii, among other places.Although tech titans have acquired Washington properties even before Trump's return to office, the pace has reportedly accelerated significantly in the past year.","The acquisition, confirmed by facebook parent company meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.

"$70m saved, 108 deals axed: Musk's watchdog DOGE torches bloated government contract",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/70m-saved-108-deals-axed-musks-watchdog-doge-torches-bloated-government-contract/articleshow/120142236.cms,"<p>Elon Musk (File photo)<br></p>

The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk , is once again making headlines with its aggressive push to cut what it sees as unnecessary federal spending. On Wednesday, the watchdog group revealed that it had canceled 108 contracts it labeled “wasteful,” boasting a ceiling value of $250 million and projected savings of $70 million.Among the nixed agreements was a $14,000 commitment by the Department of Health and Human Services , earmarked for an “executive transformational leadership training program.” Another controversial item was a $5.2 million contract involving the US Office of Personnel Management , the federal government’s HR department, to “provide strategic advisory and assistance to improve and transform current processes and organizational systems.”DOGE’s efforts haven’t gone unnoticed on the street. Fox News Digital recently interviewed Americans across several cities—Washington, DC; Detroit, Michigan; Houston, Texas; and Knoxville, Tennessee—to gather public opinion. Reactions were split. While some applauded the initiative to rein in bloated expenditures, others criticized the group for “trying to do their job with a sledgehammer.”One of the group’s earlier moves included aiding the US Coast Guard in scrapping an “ineffective IT program” known as the Logistics Information Management System , resulting in a savings of $32.7 million.DOGE has also taken aim at overseas development spending. A recent crackdown on the US African Development Foundation led to $51 million in cuts. That included funds previously used to market products like shea butter and pineapple juice, as well as facilities for mango drying.The group says its mission is to increase accountability and shed light on excessive or redundant federal expenditures. In a post shared on X, DOGE said it remains committed to removing what it deems financial inefficiencies in government operations.","Department of government efficiency (doge), led by elon musk, is once again making headlines with its aggressive push to cut what it sees as unnecessary federal spending.

"'Shame on you!': Indian-origin Microsoft techie confronts Nadella, Gates over Gaza ties",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/shame-on-you-indian-origin-microsoft-techie-confronts-nadella-gates-over-gaza-ties/articleshow/120059001.cms,"Photo: Screengrab

Poll Is it ethical for tech companies to collaborate with military organizations? No, it promotes violence. Yes, it's part of national defense.

A former Microsoft employee ignited controversy during the company’s 50th anniversary celebration, confronting top executives including CEO Satya Nadella and former heads Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. The employee, Vaniya Agrawal, an Indian-American software engineer, accused the tech giant of aiding violence in Gaza through its technologies.“Fifty thousand Palestinians in Gaza have been murdered with Microsoft technology. How dare you. Shame on all of you for celebrating on their blood,” she declared before being escorted out of the event. Neither Gates nor Nadella nor Ballmer responded to the outburst, choosing instead to continue their panel discussion.Agrawal, who has since resigned from the company, described Microsoft as a “digital weapons manufacturer” and condemned its alleged collaboration with the Israeli military. In a pointed critique, she called on Microsoft to end its ties with Israel, highlighting what she claimed was a $133 million agreement with Israel’s Ministry of Defense involving AI and Azure tools.In her resignation letter, Agrawal wrote, “I cannot, in good conscience, be part of a company that participates in this violent injustice,” and added, “If you must continue to work at Microsoft, I urge you to use your position, power, and privilege to hold Microsoft accountable to its own values and mission.”This isn’t the first time Microsoft employees have spoken out against the company's partnerships. Earlier, Ibtihal Aboussad, another staffer who also resigned, disrupted a session led by Mustafa Suleyman, Microsoft's AI CEO. She called him a “war profiteer,” accusing him and the company of enabling violence. “Microsoft technologies are being used to commit acts of genocide,” she alleged. Suleyman responded, “Thank you for your protest. I hear you.”Back in February, Nadella faced similar internal dissent when five employees were removed from a meeting after protesting Microsoft’s contracts with Israeli defense entities. The backlash has intensified in recent months as violence surged in Gaza following the breakdown of a ceasefire agreement with Hamas.","Vaniya agrawal, an indian-american software engineer, accused the tech giant of aiding violence in gaza through its technologies.

Trump Media & Technology Group ( TMTG ), the company behind US President Donald Trump’s Truth Social platform, has officially launched its mobile and streaming services, Truth Social and Truth+ TV, in Canada and Mexico , marking its first major international expansion.According to Forbes, TMTG CEO Devin Nunes announced on Wednesday that the apps are now available for download across iOS and Android devices, as well as streaming services like Roku, Apple TV, Android TV and Amazon Fire.“Truth Social and Truth+ are now fully open for business in Canada and Mexico,” Nunes said in a statement, adding that the platforms offer “a refuge from Big Tech corporations, monotonous news channels, and woke TV shows and movies”, reported Baystreet.ca.This move comes as Trump pushes ahead with sweeping tariffs on more than 60 countries, part of what he branded the “Liberation Day” trade agenda. Although Canada and Mexico were not on that initial list, both neighbours had already been hit in February with a 25% tariff on goods not protected under the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement (USMCA).Despite the economic uncertainty sparked by his tariff policy, which triggered a global sell-off in markets and warnings of recession, Trump Media’s stock (DJT) jumped 15% on Wednesday afternoon after the US President announced a 90-day pause on tariffs for some countries willing to negotiate.The stock ended the day up 3.2%, closing at $17.20, as per Baystreet.ca.TMTG, formed in 2021 after Trump was banned from major social media platforms following the January 6 Capitol riot, is now Trump’s most valuable asset.

Is Tata Trusts chair Noel moving into Ratan's Colaba house?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/is-tata-trusts-chair-noel-moving-into-ratans-colaba-house/articleshow/120144915.cms,"MUMBAI: Even as Ratan Tata 's will makes headlines, speculation has begun about the future of the sea-facing bungalow in Colaba where he lived in his later years. Will Halekai suffer the same fate as JRD Tata 's bungalow, The Cairn, or will his younger half-brother and Tata Trusts chairman, Noel Tata , choose to make it his new home?There are indications that Noel and his family may consider moving from Windmere in Cuffe Parade to the more spacious Halekai - even if not in the immediate future. Some, however, dismiss the possibility.Halekai is a four-storey, 13,350 sq ft property, owned by Ewart Investments, a 100% subsidiary of Tata Sons, and was provided to Ratan Tata. After retiring from Tata Sons in 2012, he made Halekai his home and shifted his focus primarily to his role as chairman of Tata Trusts.RNT - who studied architecture at Cornell University and briefly worked as an architect before joining the Tata Group - designed Halekai with the assistance of architect Ratan Batliboi and lived there with his German shepherds and house staff.With the chhamsi prayer ceremony - which according to Zoroastrian culture is performed six months after a person's death - concluding on Sunday, Noel, who was in Dubai for the Tata Group CEO annual conclave during the weekend, may be open to exploring the option of a shift, sources said. Instead of remaining vacant, as it has been since RNT passed away in Oct 2024, it would be better for the Colaba bungalow to be occupied, they added.The Mumbai residences of some former chairmen/deputy chairmen of the Tata Group have fallen into disuse after their demise. The Cairn on Altamount Road, where JRD Tata lived (the two-storey Scottish-style house was purchased by Tata Sons for Rs 50 crore), and the beach-facing bungalow in Juhu (near JW Marriott Hotel) owned by Naval Tata, who was deputy chairman and father of Noel and RNT, remain unoccupied. Both properties have from time to time been occupied by top Tata Group executives and friends of the Tata family, sources said.Noel, his wife Aloo Mistry, and their family have been residing in Windmere, a six-storey building in Cuffe Parade, for a considerable period. It was inherited by Aloo and her sister Laila Jehangir from their father Pallonji Mistry , the former chairman of Shapoorji Pallonji Group. Pallonji lived in Windmere until the 1980s before moving to Sterling Bay in Walkeshwar. Aloo owns six apartments (each floor has an area of 6,000 sq ft) in Windmere while Laila, an NRI, owns the remaining six. An email inquiry sent to Noel Tata regarding Halekai on April 2 did not elicit a response.","Halekai is a four-storey, 13,350 sq ft property, owned by ewart investments, a 100% subsidiary of tata sons.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New york-based air company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol. Carbon capture and utilization, or ccu, could be an important tool in the fight against climate change. But the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-633411,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
