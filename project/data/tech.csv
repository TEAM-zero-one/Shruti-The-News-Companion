Bluebird Lift-Off Shows ISRO Commercial Power As Nambi Narayanan Calls LVM-3 Game Changer Move

NEW DELHI: Isro has started the process to develop a third launchpad at the Sriharikota spaceport as it gears up for future launches of heavy satellites.The agency is currently identifying right vendors for it, a senior scientist said. To move ahead with its plan of placing bigger satellites, weighing over 12,000-14,000 kg, in various orbits in space, Isro requires bigger launch vehicles, Padmakumar ES, director and distinguished scientist of Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, said. To serve this purpose, Isro is planning a third launchpad, he said. “We plan to develop, install and commission a third launchpad in four years. Activities are going on for that,” he recently told the media.On Jan 16, 2025, the Union cabinet had approved the establishment of the third launchpad (TLP) at the Sriharikota launch complex, spread over about 175 sq km and located around 135 km east of Chennai. Worth Rs 3,984.8 crore, the launchpad project is targeted for completion within four years, with full operational readiness projected by March 2029. Critical milestones include civil works by May 2028, fluid and propellant systems by July 2028, and launch facility integration by Sept 2028.The TLP will cater to Next Generation Launch Vehicles and will support as standby launchpad for the existing two launchpads — first launchpad (serving PSLV and SSLV missions since 1993) and second launchpad (operational since 2003 for GSLV and LVM3 missions), significantly expanding launch frequency and redundancy.The TLP will be realised with maximum industry participation fully utilising Isro’s experience in establishing earlier launchpads and maximally sharing existing launch complex facilities. It will position India among leading spacefaring nations with advanced infrastructure capable of supporting next-generation rockets. This has far-reaching implications for commercial launch services, space exploration and international partnerships.","Isro has started the process to develop a third launchpad at the sriharikota spaceport.

The PNGRB on Dec 16 announced a rationalised tariff structure for pipelines that move natural gas — the feedstock for generating electricity, producing fertiliser, making CNG, and used as fuel in household kitchens.The revised tariffs, which are effective January 1, make natural gas transportation simpler, fairer, and more cost-effective for consumers and the city gas distribution sector.",The domestic piped natural gas (png) in delhi and its surrounding ncr areas became cheaper by 70 paise per unit from jan 1.

NEW DELHI: Soon all private vehicles like cars and bikes will have to get their fitness and pollution tests done at automated test stations (ATS) for renewal of registration as it is in the case of commercial vehicles. The ATS or the inspecting officer will also need to upload at least a 10 seconds geotagged video of the vehicle at the time of fitness test before issuing any certificate.The road transport ministry has proposed key changes in the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, including this, through a draft notification to prevent the malpractice of vehicle owners managing to get fitness certificates even without visiting ATS or other testing centres. This also gains significance in the light of increasing concern over air pollution and fitness of vehicles.Fitness certificate is mandatory for renewal of registration of private vehicles after attaining 15 years, and subsequently, in every five years.As per the draft notification, private vehicles, like commercial ones, will need to visit ATS, where these are established, for fitness tests. At present, there are over 160 ATS operational across the country.To ensure that the certificates are issued after carrying out genuine tests, the draft notification says that “the renewal of a certificate of fitness shall be made only after uploading at least a 10 seconds geotagged video of the vehicle at the time of fitness test, capturing the vehicle from front, rear, right side and left side ensuring clear visibility of the registration number plate, chassis number, engine number and features of the vehicle” by an authorised testing station or inspecting officer after carrying out the specified tests.In a bid to avoid vehicle owners using legal provisions to apply for multiple re-tests after vehicles fail to pass the fitness test, the proposed norms say that if a vehicle is not declared as ‘fit’ within 180 days from the first date of vehicle declared as ‘unfit’ the vehicle shall be categorised as ‘End of Life Vehicle (ELV)’ and flagged in the Vahan database as ‘ELV’.Officials said till now people used to get the timeline extended by simply submitting fees just days before the expiry of 180 days. “That won’t be possible any more. They need to get the fitness certificate within 180 days from the day the first test found the vehicle as unfit. Enough safeguards have been put in place to ensure that any ATS doesn’t give incorrect test result,” said an official.",The road transport ministry has proposed key changes in the central motor vehicles rules.

The combined net worth of Trea and Kristen Turner in 2025





There is not a group of shortstops of the modern world who have combined the concepts of speed, reliability and market longevity in the same manner that Trea Turner has done. In 2025, the Philadelphia Phillies star has become one of the best in baseball, not only because of his offering on the field but also due to the financial framework that he has undertaken over the last 11 years in the league.Timing has been one of the major factors that have led to the success of Turner, as the company has managed to capitalize on its short-term prospects to create long-term stability through consistent production. With him is his wife, Kristen Turner, whose own athletic background and long time history have tampered insidiously at the personal front of his career. Their joint net worth is a sign of patience, planning and longevity.By 2025, the MLB salaries have made Trea Turner have a net worth of about $40 million, which is virtually all the net worth. His financial zenith came in December 2022, when he opened a deal with the Philadelphia Phillies of 11 years and a total of 300 million dollars, driving his yearly income to 27 million dollars.Turner had negotiated his way through the arbitration years before that deal, with his market value steadily increasing with a series of one-year contracts.That, along with a signing bonus of $2.9 million at the start of his career and a one-year contract with the Dodgers in 2022 worth $21 million, contributed to him making approximately $45 million in salary alone in the first 6 seasons in his career in the MLB. The Phillies contract subsequently made security long-term.Kristen Turner, who used to be known as Kristen Harebedian, has not yet publicly disclosed her net worth. She was a native of Flemington, New Jersey, and a starred gymnast, with state and national competitions in high school, and a competitive career at North Carolina State University. She had a high level of discipline and competitive experience as she had numerous EAGL All-Tournament and All-Conference awards in her collegiate career.Despite no longer being an active professional, her sports experience and constant presence have been one of the components of the off-field support system of Turner since they met in college and got married in 2018.As of 2025, Trea and Kristen Turner have an estimated net worth of about $40 to $41 million in common. Although the number is motivated, first of all, by the MLB contracts of Turner, it also represents a career of a patient and stable man outside the subsidiary. The combination of their financial profile is a story of a modern successful MLB which is based on an established consistency and is not about a one-time fortune.","The combined net worth of trea and kristen turner in 2025 is estimated at $40 to $41 million.

Fans are divided on Dallas Cowboys wide receiver CeeDee Lamb; while many fans think he’s had one truly elite season and could be a one-season wonder, others believe that he has great potential and is only having a few bad weeks.It was reported early this year that CeeDee Lamb finalised a four-year, $136 million contract extension with the Cowboys shortly before the start of the regular season. Later, the deal was reworked to free up an additional $20 million in cap space for Dallas this offseason. However, Lamb isn't one to splurge on random things; he knows how to use his money well, at least that's what his luxury purchases suggestEven during his rookie contract, Lamb showed a taste for high-end automobiles and purchased a customised Lamborghini Urus. The unique super-SUV was created in collaboration with Road Show International. The customised Lamborghini Urus boasts a stylised wide-body design with carbon fibre detailing throughout the interior and exterior, finished in a striking orange paint job that immediately stands out.The super-SUV was significantly enhanced under the hood as well. The Urus is powered by a 4.0-litre twin-turbo V8 that was tuned to produce an additional 260 horsepower, pushing its total output to an incredible 901 horsepower and 750 lb-ft of torque.With that setup, the vehicle can sprint from 0 to 62 mph in just 2.8 seconds and reach a top speed of 210 mph. It also rides on Gloss Black Forgiato wheels with Hermès accents.Inside, the Lamborghini comfortably seats five and features a custom wide-grip steering wheel along with a fully upgraded sound system.This isn’t the only vehicle Lamb has personalised. He has previously partnered with Road Show International to customise a black Jeep Trackhawk and a Chevrolet Camaro ZL1 as well. While the exact cost of the modified Urus hasn’t been revealed, a standard, non-custom version starts at $225,500, according to TrueCar.Dallas secured him through the 2028 season with a massive deal that includes a record-setting $38 million signing bonus for a wide receiver and $100 million in guaranteed money.","Cowboys star ceedee lamb has a taste for luxury cars.

NBA’s tunnel fashion game is evolving at a tremendous rate and has cemented itself as one of the major pre-game events, giving the players the feeling of walking down the red carpet. It features not just casual wear but also high-end luxury items from various labels. This opportunity provides the players to leverage their looks for personal branding and generate online buzz. From wearing clothes from different brands to promoting their own, the pre-game corridor is a social media phenomenon with incredible marketing force.Here are five active stars who have successfully traded the jersey for the designer’s sketchpad.Westbrook’s Honor the Gift is one of the best player-owned brands. Founded in 2016, this brand offers premium men’s and women’s apparel and accessories inspired by LA culture. The label has moved far beyond athlete merch and has become a staple in high-end boutiques, known for its heavy knits, vintage aesthetics, premium streetwear cuts, and high-quality material. It’s a brand built on self-belief and reflects Westbrook’s journey from the inner-city to global success.Kyle Kuzma launched Childhood Dream in collaboration with Puma with a motto that “dream works too.” Kuzma’s fashion taste from his tunnel outfits could be seen as bold, unapologetic, and loud. Be it the extremely oversized pink sweater or the rainbow knitted cardigan and face mask, he owns what he wears.Through Childhood Dreams, the brand has leaned more into nostalgia, utilizing retro color palettes and 90s-inspired silhouettes reflecting Kuzama’s personal style while focusing significantly on sustainable fashion.During the 2020 NBA season, Jimmy Butler found the coffee lacking, so he bought his own espresso machine and sold a cup for around $20. He filed for the trademark and launched BIGFACE in 2021. The brand opened its Miami flagship in 2024 and has since expanded its apparel line into high-end off-duty uniforms. The clothing mirrors Butler’s personality: focused, premium, and intentionally unique.While LeBron has a lifetime deal with Nike, his creative heart lives in UNKNWN. He co-founded this brand with his childhood friends, Jason Kanfer and Frankie Walker Jr. The brand’s physical store was opened in Miami’s Aventura Mall in 2011, offering various external labels and and in 2019, it introduced its first private “001 collection.”UNKNWN remains a massive influence in the streetwear scene, frequently collaborating with titans like Thom Browne.Taking a page from the Michael Jordan playbook, Stephen Curry launched Curry Brand under the Under Armour umbrella. While it focuses on performance, it also saw a massive push into lifestyle apparel this year. The line reflects Curry's understated but precise style, offering everything from technical golf gear to minimalist street pieces. As of late 2025, Stephen Curry and Under Armour parted ways after 12 years of partnership, making the Curry Brand fully independent.Also read: From Seoul to courtside: how many NBA games has BTS star Suga attended?","Nba's tunnel fashion game is evolving at a tremendous rate.

Micah Parsons vs CeeDee Lamb: Who is richer right now and what’s next





Micah Parsons and CeeDee Lamb are two of the biggest stars on the Dallas Cowboys roster. Both are young, famous, and earning serious money in the NFL. Fans often ask the same thing when their names come up together. Who is richer right now? The answer comes down to contracts, endorsements, and how far each career has gone so far.Micah Parsons entered the NFL in 2021 as a first-round pick by the Dallas Cowboys. He signed a four-year rookie contract worth about $17 million, fully guaranteed.The Cowboys also picked up his fifth-year option, which keeps him under contract through the 2025 season. As of now, Micah Parsons has earned most of his money from NFL salary and bonuses.He has not yet signed a massive long-term extension, but league insiders expect one soon because he is one of the best defensive players in football.CeeDee Lamb took a big financial leap in August 2024 when he signed a four-year, $136 million extension with the Dallas Cowboys.That deal included a record signing bonus for a wide receiver at the time and made him one of the highest-paid non-quarterbacks in the league.Before that extension, CeeDee Lamb played on his rookie contract after being drafted in 2020.Because of this new deal, his career earnings already sit higher than Micah Parsons at this stage.Both players make money away from the field.

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon musk has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

Ex-Rockstar developer has a GTA 6 warning: ‘If the game is delayed again…',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/gaming/ex-rockstar-developer-has-a-gta-6-warning-if-the-game-is-delayed-again/articleshow/126189019.cms,"Former Rockstar developer Mike York warns that further delays to Grand Theft Auto 6 could significantly diminish public interest. He believes Rockstar is prioritizing polish to meet high expectations, but prolonged waits risk alienating fans. York anticipates a November 2026 release, citing it as an optimal period for sales.

“We’ve been waiting so long for

GTA 6

already that if there was to be another delay, people will probably stop caring about its release even more. If

Rockstar

Games delay GTA 6 again then the hype around the game will die down almost completely. Right now, nobody is searching for GTA 6. Everyone knows there’s no news, there’s nothing to talk about… There’s a point to where you delay something so much that you start to make people angry.”

“People aren’t itching to find new details or a latest leak anymore, they’re over it. They are thinking, ‘it will come out when it comes out’, as they’re so burnt out from thinking it will come out soon and then it doesn’t… And then they’re like, ‘OK, whatever…’”

Why Ex-Rockstar developer thinks Rockstar has been delaying the game

“If I know Rockstar Games, and I know the guys over there, one of the reasons for the delay in releasing GTA 6 is because they’re trying to make it look as best as it can possibly be. They’re polishing stuff.

I don’t think they’re completely finished with the game, given how much is on the line and how big everyone’s expectations are for it.”

“I think the game will be released in November 2026 as it’s a good time for the game to come out for Rockstar for multiple reasons to sell video games. If you want to sell a big amount of video games then that’s the perfect time for GTA 6 to come out with it being a month before Christmas. Usually companies only delay these things once or twice when they need to, so I think it will come out around that time,”





Former Rockstar Games developer Mike York has a critical warning for the Take-Two-owned gaming studio. He has warned that the hype and public interest around Grand Theft Auto 6 will “die down” almost completely if the game faces any more delays. In an interview with Esports Insider (as seen by Dexerto), York said:York cited fan reactions showing growing frustration, with some saying they “don’t even care anymore” because repeated delays keep letting them down.he added.The game’s delay from May to November 2026 even caused anger in Poland’s parliament, with an opposition lawmaker calling the postponement “a huge scandal” during a session.Explaining Rockstar’s reason behind GTA 6 delay, York said:York believes Rockstar is aiming to meet very high internal standards and may not feel it has reached that level yet.York noted.Till date, Rockstar has released two official trailers of the highly anticiapted game which have confirmed that GTA 6 is set in a modern Vice City. The game will feature dual protagonists, deeper RPG systems, realistic physics, new heist tools and a more evolving open world.Rockstar has not announced the official price for India. However, early industry estimates suggest the standard edition may be priced around ₹9,000, which is much higher than GTA V’s console launch price of ₹3,499.","Former rockstar developer mike york warns that further delays to grand theft auto 6 could significantly diminish public interest.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him. The IIT rejection redirected his life towards a path only few could have imagined and which eventually led him to become the CEO of Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable companies. Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software. Nadella further added that like many of friends he also viewed IIT as the pinnacle of academic achievement. But when he failed to secure admission, Nadella faced a setback that could have easily defined his future. Instead, it became the catalyst for a different journey.Nadella described IIT as “the holy grail” for middle-class students, acknowledging the weight of expectations. Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there. However, all these experiences helped him in building adaptability which later went ahead and defined his leadership style.Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992, after working at Sun Microsystems. Over, the next two decade he rose steadily through the ranks and the became the Microsoft CEO in 2014. When Nadella became the CEO, the company was facing a lot competition from Apple, Google and Amazon. However, under his leadership, Microsoft reinvented itself and it now a market valuation of $3.54 trillion.Nadella has often said that “only in America would someone like me get the chance to prove himself rather than be typecast based on the school I attended.”","Microsoft ceo satya nadella once shared his experience of how not going to iit which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him.

Alexandr Wang is reportedly clashing with Meta’s old guard

Meta’s Secret AI Army: Top Talent Hired from OpenAI, Google & More

Alexandr Wang memo on Meta's massive AI restructure





In June this year, Facebook-parent Meta Platforms agreed to take a 49% stake in artificial intelligence (AI) startup Scale AI for $14.8 billion. As part of the deal, Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang took top position inside Meta, leading the company's new “superintelligence” lab, , Meta Superintelligence Labs, or MSL. The 28-year-old founder of Scale AI, Wang has been installed as the public face of Zuckerberg’s AI reboot. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly paid billions to bring billionaire AI prodigy Alexandr Wang on board. However, it reportedly seems that all is not well between the AI wunderkind and his Boss, Mark Zuckerberg. The 41-year-old Zuckerberg is said to have backed his new hires with nine-figure compensation packages to lure top researchers from rivals, igniting a Silicon Valley poaching war.According to a report in Financial Times, Wang privately believes that CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s micromanagement of the company’s AI push is ""suffocating"". Wang is said to have complained to associates that Zuckerberg’s tight grip on the effort is stifling progress, the report said, citing multiple people familiar with the situation. Report adds that cracks have begun to emerge at an executive level and that tensions have been bubbling between Wang and Zuckerberg for sometime now.As per the report, internally, some staff question whether Wang is out of his depth, given his lack of experience managing teams in a large corporation but also his expertise in AI data services rather than as an AI researcher pushing technical breakthroughs.Incidentally, Alexander Wang’s arrival at Meta has created friction over the company's fundamental approach to AI development, with his superintelligence team pushing to make the company’s next model “closed” — keeping its technology secret. This is said to mark a major departure from Meta’s longtime philosophy of open-sourcing its models for other developers to build upon, causing some old guard members to chafe at the change, the Times reported.The new leadership has chosen to abandon Meta’s previous frontier model called Behemoth, which saw its release delayed last spring after disappointing performance tests. Meta’s AI division faces a dramatic four-way split as Meta reorganizes into groups focused on research, superintelligence development, products, and infrastructure, according to the report.As the new vision and leadership have crystallised, some top names have left. Among them, in recent weeks, Meta’s longtime chief legal officer Jennifer Newstead was poached by arch-rival Apple, while chief revenue officer John Hegeman announced he too was leaving to launch a start-up.Similarly, chief AI scientist and Turing Award winner Yann LeCun is departing Meta to launch a new AI initiative. He had reportedly taken exception at having to report to Wang. Another reason cited for his resignation is that his longer-term research was reportedly hit hard by the recent cuts announced at Meta.Meta reorganized its AI teams in June this year. The memo said that most team leaders will report directly to 28-year-old Wang. This included investor and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, who heads MSL's product team and was announced as an MSL leader alongside Wang in June. In the email sent to employees, Wang wrote that ""superintelligence is coming,"" and to ""take it seriously,"" Meta needs to make major changes. This includes establishing four distinct teams that focus on research, training, products, and infrastructure.The reorganisation is the latest in a series of AI reorgs for Meta. Incidentally, Meta had already dissolved two major AI teams in the past six months.",Alexandr wang is reportedly clashing with meta’s old guard. Mark zuckerberg reportedly paid billions to bring billionaire ai prodigy alexandr wang on board. Wang is said to have complained to associates that zuckerberg's tight grip on the effort is stifling progress.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126064464,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-16686,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
