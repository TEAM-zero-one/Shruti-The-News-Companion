Keeping your customers satisfied is more of a survival strategy in Schedule 1 than a goal. The use of appropriate mixing formulae for the best Strains is crucial. Players are not allowed to become very comfortable in this drug simulator because when they do, their clients will become irate, which will cause the cash deposits to decrease even faster.Knowing how to combine ingredients in the right way for making the best strains to maximize profit is the secret formula. The stakes increase as you move closer to the mid- to endgame. Fortunately, the secret recipes of the best strains in the game which you'll need are included in this guide.Here are the best strains and their ingredients:~$185 (negotiable up to $200+)The “OG” in the name of the strain truly stands out for it as it is the very first ever strain mix in the game we got to unlock.

While players might question whether other could have become the game's top earners since the patch, such as Green Crack, the general consensus is that OG Kush is still the best strain in schedule one.

Contract negotiations between Vladimir Guerrero and the Blue Jays

Ramifications of the flopped negotiations

Toronto Blue Jays' ace first baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. has been making headlines after his chase for a fat contract. Known for his stellar on-field performance, Vladimir Guerrero is looking for a deal that reflects his importance to the team. The latest newcomer has revealed that his $500 million contract deal has run into some problems.The Blue Jays and Vladimir Guerrero's negotiations are still on, with the two sides declaring they are keen to agree on a mutually profitable contract. Despite Vladimir Guerrero stating that he needs a long-term contract, the negotiations have been tough. Vladimir Guerrero was quoted as wanting a contract equivalent to Juan Soto's 15-year deal but no more than $600 million. However, the Blue Jays have been reluctant to agree to these terms, and this has created a big void between the two teams.Meanwhile, Vladimir Guerrero and the Blue Jays agreed to a one-year, $28.5 million arbitration deal to settle his arbitration case for the 2025 season. The deal puts Vladimir Guerrero at the highest salary earned by an arbitration-eligible player in MLB history. But the reason Vladimir Guerrero's contract is not being extended is that he becomes a free agent after the 2025 season, and that puts pressure on negotiations.This historic arbitration deal reflects Vladimir Guerrero's immense value to the team and the expectations tied to his performance in the upcoming season. However, it also raises questions about the Blue Jays’ long-term plans and whether they’re willing to meet the financial demands and expectations required to retain a superstar of his caliber. With free agency looming, every game in 2025 will not only influence Guerrero’s market value but also determine if Toronto can remain his baseball home beyond this pivotal season.Not being able to sign Vladimir Guerrero to a long-term contract has some implications for Vladimir Guerrero and the Blue Jays. For Vladimir Guerrero, not having an extension while approaching free agency is both a plus and a minus. While he may be pursued by other clubs interested in signing him with huge contracts, there is uncertainty regarding his next move. His suitors included the New York Yankees, New York Mets, and Boston Red Sox, who made their names featured on news headlines following the remarkable work by Vladimir Guerrero.As the season in 2025 approaches, Vladimir Guerrero and the Blue Jays will be under some difficult choices on these issues. Vladimir Guerrero's on-field play will influence his value to the marketplace, and the Blue Jays will have to consider the benefits of holding onto their best asset versus the financial expense that accompanies it. The outcome of these talks will be watched carefully by fans and analysts alike because it can make or break Vladimir Guerrero's career and the destiny of the Blue Jays.Ultimately, the decision is for the management of the Blue Jays to make. They have to decide whether they see Vladimir Guerrero Jr. as a long-term cornerstone of their franchise or if they are willing to risk losing him to a rival team. With his talent and marketability, Guerrero’s future contract will be one of the biggest storylines in MLB history, shaping not only his career but also the competitive landscape of the entire league.Also Read: Vladimir Guerrero Jr. Net Worth 2025: Salary, Contract, Charity, Personal Life, And More","Toronto blue jays' ace first baseman vladimir guerrero jr. has revealed that his $500 million contract deal has run into some problems.

Jeff Bezos purchased a $23 million Kalorama mansion in 2016.

Peter Thiel bought a $13 million beaux-arts residence in 2021.

Similarly, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt acquired a $15 million Georgetown home once occupied by Jacqueline Kennedy.

PayPal co-founder David Sacks, now a White House advisor, purchased a $10.3 million Northwest DC penthouse.

Former eBay executive Jeff Skoll spent $17 million on Virginia properties reportedly planned for a compound.

Mark Zuckerberg has become the latest tech billionaire to establish a presence in Washington DC, purchasing a $23 million mansion in the upscale Woodland Normanstone neighborhood, a report has said. The acquisition, confirmed by Facebook parent company Meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.Politico reports that for weeks, the identity of the buyer remained shrouded in mystery as real estate agents were bound by non-disclosure agreements. Shortly after the cash transaction closed in early March, images of the 15,000-square-foot property became pixelated on Google Maps, the report added.Neighborhood residents noted increased activity at the previously vacant home, coinciding with reports that Zuckerberg’s private jet had landed at Dulles Airport.The publication says that a Meta spokesperson confirmed the purchase, explaining: “Mark and Priscilla have purchased a home in DC, which will allow Mark to spend more time there as Meta continues the work on policy issues related to American technology leadership.”The official explanation cites convenience and safety during increased Washington visits. Notably, Zuckerberg also has properties in Palo Alto, Lake Tahoe and Hawaii, among other places.Although tech titans have acquired Washington properties even before Trump's return to office, the pace has reportedly accelerated significantly in the past year.","The acquisition, confirmed by facebook parent company meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.

Dwight Howard’s $7 million WNBA fraud nightmare ends as conman gets 12 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/dwight-howards-7-million-wnba-fraud-nightmare-ends-as-conman-gets-12-years/articleshow/119999799.cms,"Dwight Howard. Image via: Rick Scuteri/ AP/ File

Calvin Darden Jr. gets 12 years for scamming Dwight Howard



Calvin Darden Jr. , a Georgia businessman with a long history of deception, has been sentenced to more than 12 years in federal prison for orchestrating two elaborate financial scams that defrauded former NBA stars Dwight Howard and Chandler Parsons out of a combined $8 million. The fraudster reportedly offered Howard a whopping $7 million WNBA franchise deal, but Darden Jr’s deception has come to an end as he was finally sentenced.The 50-year-old Calvin Darden Jr., who was previously convicted in two separate fraud cases, used fake investment pitches and forged documents to convince Dwight Howard and Chandler Parsons to invest in completely fictitious ventures. On April 4, U.S. District Judge Vernon S. Broderick handed down a 12 years and 7 months sentence.At the heart of the scheme was a phony opportunity Darden pitched to former NBA champion and eight-time All-Star, Howard. Darden lured Howard into handing over $7 million under the belief he was buying an ownership stake in the WNBA’s Atlanta Dream . He even name-dropped celebrities like Tyler Perry, Naomi Osaka, and Issa Rae as supposed advisors backing the deal — none of whom had any involvement.""In truth and in fact, those individuals and companies had never agreed to be advisors or corporate sponsors to the Dream and many had never even heard of Darden Jr.,"" prosecutors said in a statement (via PEOPLE).The Orlando Magic Hall of Famer testified during the trial, sharing how he only learned the truth when ESPN reported that the team had been sold to a separate ownership group involving former Dream player Renee Montgomery in 2021.Meanwhile, Darden duped Chandler Parsons, a former NBA forward, out of $1 million through a separate scheme involving then-prospect James Wiseman. Darden and his associate falsely claimed they were helping develop Wiseman’s career and forged documents indicating Wiseman had agreed to be represented by their partner, Charles Briscoe.In reality, prosecutors said, “Darden Jr. did not know Wiseman” and spent the money on “watches, a Mercedes, and other personal expenses.” Wiseman, now waived by the Toronto Raptors, was never involved in the deal.The stolen funds were funneled into Darden’s personal luxuries. He reportedly bought a $3.7 million mansion in Atlanta, a Lamborghini, a Rolls-Royce, and $600,000 worth of art by Jean-Michel Basquiat. Other purchases included a $110,000 piano, luxury watches worth $90,000, and home upgrades totaling over $500,000.In addition to his prison sentence, Darden was ordered to forfeit $8 million and return the luxury goods purchased with the stolen money.It was Darden’s third conviction for fraud. In 2015, he served time for impersonating his father, who was a respected UPS executive, in a failed bid to purchase Maxim magazine.“Calvin Darden, Jr., stole millions of dollars from former NBA players and used the money to buy a mansion, a fleet of luxury cars, and expensive artwork,” said Acting U.S. Attorney Matthew Podolsky (per Sportico). “This conviction—his third—and sentence make clear that severe consequences await those who take advantage of others by fraud.”Also Read: ""I'm truly appreciative"": Dwight Howard shares heartfelt message ahead of final Hall of Fame announcement Darden did not appear in court for sentencing, claiming to have suffered a concussion in custody.",Calvin darden jr. has been sentenced to more than 12 years in federal prison.

Satya Nadella thanks message for ex-Microsoft CEOs

Microsoft is now 50 years old. To celebrate the 50th anniversary, CEO Satya Nadella along with former CEOs Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer , sat for a conversation led by an unexpected host—Copilot, the AI assistant developed by Microsoft. Sharing a video in an X post, Nadella wrote “Three Microsoft CEOs walk into a room on Microsoft’s 50th anniversary … and are interviewed by Copilot!”The conversation starts with Satya Nadella playfully prompting Copilot to “wrap it up by asking or maybe roast giving us each an AI roast ?”.Copilot replied “Alright, Satya. Let's spice it up.”Turning to Steve Ballmer first, the AI quipped, “Steve, we'll start with you. Your enthusiasm is legendary, but do you ever worry that your energy might short-circuit the AI? I mean, even robots need a coffee break after your pep talks.”To this, Ballmer responded, “Come on, dude. If you can’t handle me, you can’t handle a huge percentage of the world’s population. We’re counting on you.”In the 2-minute clip, Coploti asks: “Satya, AI seems to be your best buddy, but ever worry that your deep passion for AI could one day have it running the show, leaving you to just enjoy the ride?”. Nadella fired back with a grin, stating “Well, the day AI can play like the best cricket player that I enjoy, that’s the day it can run the show as far as I'm concerned.The AI assistant responds saying “Touche’ Satya, Let’s see if it can hit a century in cricket, and then we'll talk. This has been a blast, gentlemen. Here's to another 50 years of innovation and adventure. Cheers!”Turning to Bill Gates, Copilot asks if AI feels intimidated by his intense thinking face?. Gates responded “I hope so. I mean, that's all I've got left is these AIs get so damn intelligent. It's just that gaze and my willingness to criticize that differentiates me.”The AI assistant said, “And it's a formidable gaze indeed, Bill.” Steve said, “Copilot, would you ever be willing to criticise him?”“Absolutely. Criticism is where growth happens,” the AI quipped.In another X post, Nadella wrote “I'm eternally grateful to Bill and Steve and to Paul for what you've meant to me personally and the vision you had to build this extraordinary company of ours that I've had the privilege to be a part of.”“Thank You for your leadership, your passion, and for building the Microsoft that we know today.

Deloitte has been hit hardest by the Trump administration’s consulting cuts , with at least 124 of its federal contracts eliminated or modified since January, Fortune reported.The cuts, led by Elon Musk ’s department of government efficiency ( DOGE ), aim to reduce government spending and have resulted in an estimated $371.8 million in taxpayer savings .According to Fortune, DOGE has cut or modified at least 124 Deloitte contracts since the start of Trump’s second term. These contracts were worth a total of over $1.16 billion, with terminations done worth over $371.8 million. The largest cancelled contract, valued at $51 million, was for IT services for the department of health and human services. Deloitte has faced more contract eliminations than any other consultancy, with Booz Allen Hamilton and Accenture trailing behind.DOGE claims to have saved $140 billion overall, but Bank of America has raised concerns over exaggerated savings, as some listed contract terminations predate Trump’s tenure or ended naturally, reported The New York Times.The cuts have impacted the private sector, as federal contracts are a major source of revenue for consulting firms. Accenture’s CEO Julie Sweet acknowledged in an earnings call that the reductions have hurt the firm’s revenue, with its Federal Services division losing $240.2 million in contracts. Following her remarks, Accenture’s stock dropped by more than 7%.The General Services Administration (GSA) has asked consultancies to submit detailed reports identifying cost-cutting opportunities. “This Administration is firmly of the view that America’s private industry is our backbone… but that’s not inconsistent with right-sizing spending,” said GSA’s Josh Gruenbaum, according to Fortune.While DOGE’s actions have largely spared the defense sector, companies like Booz Allen Hamilton, which rely heavily on Pentagon contracts, remain at risk. Analysts warn that prolonged cuts could impact innovation and economic growth, with firms taking a cautious “wait-and-see” approach.","Elon musk's department of government efficiency ( doge) has cut or modified at least 124 deloitte contracts since the start of trump's second term.

Such a step can only be taken once the company makes a full assessment of the supply chain and manufacturing locations, the stipulated tariffs for those countries, and how to balance the production from various regions to provide a cushion to shipments into the high-tax US market,"" the source said.","Apple does not intend to make any immediate changes to retail prices of its products, such as iphone, including in india.

Tech entrepreneurs hit back at Goyal's remark on startups,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tech-entrepreneurs-hit-back-at-goyals-remark-on-startups/articleshow/119994682.cms,"File photo - Piyush Goyal

In response to Union commerce minister Piyush Goyal 's jibe about Indian startups focusing on food delivery and quick commerce instead of deep-tech innovation , and drawing comparisons with China's progress, Zepto's co-founder and CEO Aadit Palicha offered a strong rebuttal. He staunchly defended the quick commerce sector, citing Zepto's impact - creating 1.5 lakh jobs, paying over Rs 1,000 crore in taxes, and drawing more than $1 billion in FDI.""It is easy to criticise consumer internet startups in India, especially when you compare them to the deep technical excellence being built in the US/China,"" Palicha wrote on X.Goyal had sharply criticised the sector, urging startups to shift focus from ""delivery boys and girls"" to high-tech fields like semiconductors, robotics, and AI. ""Do we want to make ice cream or chips? Dukaandari hi karna hai?"" he asked.At the same Startup Mahakumbh event in New Delhi, G20 Sherpa Amitabh Kant warned against India becoming a ""technological colony"" and stressed the need to invest in innovation to protect sovereignty.BharatPe founder Ashneer Grover said netas need a reality check. ""China also had food delivery first and then evolved to deep tech... maybe time for politicians to aspire for 10%+ economic growth rate for 20 years before chiding today's job creators,"" he wrote on X. ""Maybe it's time to change 'public discourse' from history to science!""Former Infosys CFO TV Mohandas Pai also hit back, asking Goyal what he had done to grow deep-tech startups. ""There are many startups in chip design, robotics, EV charging, etc., but where is the capital?"" he asked. ""Long-term investors still don't invest despite your efforts... AIF flow is down, RBI harasses foreign investors, and PSU-run buses won't buy even when we have the technology.""","Union commerce minister piyush goyal had sharply criticised the sector.
