'All Indians from India': NYU graduation video triggers major row; 'too much brown',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/all-indians-from-india-nyu-graduation-video-triggers-major-row-too-much-brown/articleshow/123312786.cms,"A video of NYU graduates went viral as social media users hinted that there were hardly any Americans.

Poll Do you think diversity among graduates entering the workforce is a strength? Yes, it brings fresh perspectives No, it affects local opportunities





A video of NYU students sharing their joy of joining jobs straight after their graduation turned into a controversial one as social media users pointed out that almost none of the students interviewed in the video were American. While many users complained that all of them were Indians, all of them were not Indian but mostly all of them were Asians. The video did not reveal their names and all assumptions were based on the appearance and the accent of the graduates.""NYU just posted a video of where their graduates are heading to work after college. Anyone notice anything in this video?"" the video meant for rage-bait was captioned. Many users did not take the bait and said they all looked like America-born immigrants and there was nothing wrong about it. Some, in fact, pointed out the lack of diversity in their jobs, showing they are not interested in other fields.""Nice dog whistle. The reason the US is an economic powerhouse is because of it’s cognitively elite immigrants. But yeah, keep being mad at them,"" one wrote. ""All of them must be sent back. We must reclaim our universities for Americans,"" another wrote.""Can someone please explain how these foreigners get into this school, the how can they afford it? After they got here to this country and got into this school and all that good stuff , how do they get jobs in the biggest companies on earth? I was born in Brooklyn , I can’t even get a job at Burger King.Asking for a friend thanks,"" one wrote.""Why is America educating its enemies? I’ve heard that they also get scholarships and aid. What are we doing here?"" one comment read.""All the Indians are from India with accents not American born and they’re taking jobs away from American born graduates,"" a user wrote.""Too much brown. And a lot of purple,"" one wrote, purple being the color of their graduation robe.With the big tech companies announcing major layoffs this year, all eyes are on the hirings and how much of it actually goes to American graduates. The comments point to a larger surge of anti-immigrant feeling, directed mainly at South Asians, amid disputes surrounding skilled immigration and H-1B visa policies.","A video of nyu graduates went viral as social media users hinted that there were hardly any americans.

India gets its first privately funded institute for maths research,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-gets-its-first-privately-funded-institute-for-maths-research/articleshow/123352435.cms,"Representational Image

MUMBAI: India, said Fields medallist Manjul Bhargava, must fall in love with mathematics again. Not as a ""drudgery of formulae"" but as an act of ""exploration"".Bhargava, Canadian by nationality but of Indian origin, believes classrooms need an overhaul-""experimental, playful,"" he said, with teachers ""trained"" to spark curiosity. Speaking to TOI on the sidelines of the launch of the Lodha Mathematical Sciences Institute (LMSI), he added: ""I'm happy with the new textbooks and the changes brought in them. But they will only show impact in a few years.""On the scientific advisory council of LMSI, Bhargava will lead sessions on arithmetic statistics, its new developments, and future directions. State cabinet minister Mangal Prabhat Lodha called it a school ""not for an individual, not for a business, but for the nation that always prioritised knowledge over all and for India that gave so much math to the world.""Entirely devoted to post-doctoral research, LMSI is India's first privately funded mathematics institute, backed by Lodha Foundation with a Rs 20,000 crore endowment. ""We realised that for any nation to become strong, we ought to have original thinking and promote innovation,"" said Abhishek Lodha, CEO and MD of Lodha Developers. The privately funded mathematics research institute in the country is completely free, he added.Founding director V Kumar Murthy-who earlier led Toronto's Fields Institute-described math as the hidden scaffolding of modern life: the foundation for finance, engineering, and technology. Economist Nachiket Mor, also on the advisory panel, noted that models built in the West often collapse in India because they rarely account for ""unique characteristics"" like limited liquidity and higher viscosity of adjustment. ""This reality makes it all the more urgent for us to build deep capacity mathematics,"" he said.Murthy explained that LMSI would begin not with students but with teachers. Ten senior number theorists have been chosen to seed the effort. As president, Murthy said he plans to travel across the country, meeting mathematicians firsthand and mapping who is doing what. The aim is to build a network where the ""brightest minds"" are spotted early, handpicked, and nurtured.By Dec 2026, LMSI will host the first Indian Congress of Mathematicians, showcasing contributions of Indian-origin mathematicians worldwide.","Fields medallist manjul bhargava says india must fall in love with mathematics again.

“She sells her soul to the devil”: Tom Brady's ex-wife Gisele Bündchen accused of promoting satanic worship,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/she-sells-her-soul-to-the-devil-tom-bradys-ex-wife-gisele-bndchen-accused-of-promoting-satanic-worship/articleshow/123345593.cms,"Gisele Bündchen's Vogue cover in March 2023 sparked a social media frenzy (Getty Images)

How Gisele Bündchen's Vogue cover sparked conspiracy chatter

Why the backlash didn’t derail Gisele Bündchen's career

When Gisele Bündchen appeared on an Italian Vogue cover in March 2023, the photograph immediately ignited a storm of social media reaction — not for fashion praise, but for conspiracy chatter. What began as a striking editorial image quickly ballooned into accusations and viral comparisons that linked the pose to occult imagery, turning a routine magazine moment into a short-lived culture war.The image, shot by Brazilian photographer Rafael Pavarotti, showed Gisele Bündchen in a stylized, dramatic pose that some viewers compared to historical depictions of Baphomet. Online users pointed to hand gestures, wardrobe choices and color palettes as “evidence,” and within hours the post that circulated on Twitter and other platforms was filled with speculation.A handful of commentators even dove into etymology and symbolism — linking her name and the photograph to more sensational claims — which amplified the controversy beyond any editorial intent.Two things stopped the story from sticking. First, there was no credible evidence tying Bündchen to anything beyond a fashion shoot; the claims were conjecture dressed up as proof. Second, the episode came amid intense public interest in her personal life following her high-profile split from Tom Brady, which primed audiences to read extra meaning into ordinary moments.Bündchen remained publicly silent, a common choice for established figures facing internet storms — and continued to book campaigns and covers, demonstrating the resilience of a long-standing career.Looking back, the Vogue kerfuffle is a textbook example of how images travel differently in the social media age: editorial art can be reframed into controversy within hours. As a throwback, it’s a reminder that viral outrage often tells us more about the platform dynamics and cultural moment than about the subject herself.Also Read: “Tom is acting bitter”: Tom Brady’s reflections on work and parenting allegedly reopened rift with ex-wife Gisele Bündchen In Bündchen’s case, the controversy faded quickly, leaving her professional momentum intact and the photo as an odd footnote in an otherwise illustrious modeling legacy.","Gisele bündchen's vogue cover in march 2023 sparked a social media frenzy.

“They’re pressuring these creators to donate money”: Nick Eh 30 claims MrBeast gets all the credit for Team Water donations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/news/theyre-pressuring-these-creators-to-donate-money-nick-eh-30-claims-mrbeast-gets-all-the-credit-for-team-water-donations/articleshow/123344895.cms,"Image via: Instagram/Nick Eh 30

Nick Eh 30 On The Pressure Talk

The Recognition Dilemma

Big Synergy for a Big Cause



In the era of livestreaming and viral online challenges, giving has found its digital manifestation. MrBeast, who ranks among one of the biggest names on YouTube, started TeamWater on August 1, 2025, a massive movement to raise millions for clean-water access worldwide. In a little over two weeks, the efforts passed the $30 million mark, thanks to donations from fans, corporations, and other creators. Yet recognition for the extremely worthy cause has been an issue of contention within the creator community, with the debate spilling over into alleged pressuring tactics.Nick Eh 30, a Twitch streamer and Fortnite athlete, expressed his feelings during a recent broadcast, in which he basically said that while the cause was worthy, the somewhat forced participation from some creators put people on the fence about it.He mentioned, “So, MrBeast gets all the credit. So, you know when he's, you know, asking people to donate on a stream and stuff and pressuring them. I just think it's kind of a little weird. Bro, when they're pressuring these creators to donate money and everything for that. I can see why some creators don't want to do it because it's MrBeast's name that gets all the recognition.""Nick's question, which goes into the whole ownership theme, somehow lies at the heart of the entire critique.MrBeast has basically branded himself as an online philanthropist through TeamTrees and TeamSeas, two extraordinarily popular campaigns. TeamWater is in line with this legacy, but according to Nick, it could be to the detriment of much smaller creators.For some, the issue is not that they would refuse to donate for a worthwhile cause-it is in being pressured to do so in public spaces where refraining from it could be deemed socially frowned upon. In an environment where image and branding are everything, creators often weigh not only the financial cost of donation but also the optics of being a part of-or in some instances refusing to be-a well-publicized call to action.In spite of the uneasy feelings, TeamWater this time received massive support. Top influencers such as Sophie Rain pledged seven figures in donations. At the same time, streaming behemoths such as Felix ""xQc"" and Adin Ross teamed with MrBeast for a marathon fundraising stream.Their initial ambition was continuous streaming to collect $12 million, but the campaign has more than doubled that target. For the supporters, the huge response has proved that the end justifies the means.","Mrbeast started teamwater on august 1, 2025, a massive movement to raise millions for clean-water access worldwide.

GPT-5 Unlocked: From College Student to PhD Expert!

Parag Agrawal , former CEO of Twitter, has embarked on a new chapter in his tech journey, after the public dismantling of Twitter and its transformation into X under Elon Musk . He’s now at the helm of Parallel Web Systems , an AI startup that aims to change how AI agents perform real-world tasks for humans on a computer, acting much like a digital assistant. According to a report by Bloomberg, following his unceremonious firing by Tesla CEO, his friends and former colleagues urged him to take a much-needed break from the intense Twitter saga, but Agrawal chose a different path.“I’m not a person that can enjoy the beach in that moment,” Agrawal shared, showing his immediate drive to build anew. He immersed himself in intense meetings at a Palo Alto coffee shop, delving into research papers, writing code and creating the startup from his laptop.Agrawal said that he received numerous job offers but most were uninspiring, asking him to “clean up shit,” as he put it. With his extensive background in building machine learning systems at Twitter, Agrawal was convinced his next venture had to be in AI.He said that just a month after his departure from Twitter, OpenAI launched ChatGPT , opening opportunities for artificial intelligence startups, with companies like Anthropic PBC rapidly expanding.Parallel Web Systems is developing infrastructure that empowers AI agents—think of them as smart tools capable of handling complex computer tasks on your behalf. The core of Parallel's innovation lies in helping these AI agents efficiently search the web for the most accurate information.This capability is often the critical difference between an AI agent successfully completing a task and failing altogether, ensuring the tools can deliver on their promise.Agrawal's new endeavor has already garnered significant attention, successfully raising $30 million in funding. Notable investors include billionaire Vinod Khosla through his firm, Khosla Ventures . Agrawal now leads a 25-person team from a Palo Alto office, not far from where he first incorporated the company on his laptop.“I don’t think Twitter defines me. If I do a good job, I’m hoping this company will define me,” Agrawal says of his new role. Agrawal – a former International Physics Olympiad gold medalist with a doctorate in computer science from Stanford University – steadily climbed the ranks at Twitter over more than a decade.Starting as an engineer on the advertising team, he eventually rose to become Chief Technology Officer under then-CEO Jack Dorsey. His contributions included work on core products like Twitter’s initial advertising technology and its algorithmic timeline. He was appointed Dorsey's successor in late 2021.","Parag agrawal, former ceo of twitter, has embarked on a new chapter in his tech journey.

Sridhar Vembu , the co-founder and chief scientist of Zoho Corporation , has provided valuable insights into the evolving role of artificial intelligence (AI) in modern workplaces and business processes. He acknowledges AI’s immense potential to accelerate learning, streamline workflows, and enhance overall product and service experiences, making operations more efficient and data-driven. However, Vembu cautions that over-reliance on AI, misuse, or unmonitored implementation can reduce, or even reverse, the expected productivity gains, creating unforeseen challenges.His perspective underscores the critical importance of responsible AI adoption , emphasising human oversight, ethical considerations, and continuous evaluation of AI systems. By balancing technology with careful management, businesses can harness AI’s advantages while mitigating risks and ensuring sustainable growth.Vembu revealed his personal AI habits in a post on X (formerly Twitter) in August 2025, describing himself as a “moderate to heavy” user.A unique approach he follows is having multiple AI systems debate and critique each other’s outputs, which he believes enhances understanding and critical thinking.Vembu highlighted that AI can significantly enhance product experiences and improve customer service efficiency:Tools like Grok in X show how AI can streamline user interaction and provide quicker solutions.AI can support customer service agents, enabling faster responses and more efficient handling of queries.However, he warns against allowing AI to fully replace human agents. Passing off AI-generated responses as human without disclosure is unethical and risks damaging trust.Vembu emphasised that AI should assist rather than replace human creativity:He advises against using AI to create original content independently.Copying and pasting AI-generated responses without human review or disclosure is considered unprofessional.AI is a tool to augment human intelligence, not a substitute for critical thinking, creativity, or decision-making.Vembu also discussed AI in software development, pointing out potential risks and limitations:AI-generated code must undergo comprehensive compliance, privacy, and security reviews. Skipping these processes can undermine software quality, compromise security, and violate professional standards.In some instances, these verification steps may eliminate much of AI’s time-saving advantage, and improper use could even slow development.Zoho programmers are encouraged to use AI for learning and problem-solving, but not as a complete replacement for human coding judgement.Vembu’s philosophy focuses on moderation, experimentation, and evaluation:Use AI to enhance productivity, learning, and problem-solving, not as a full substitute for human expertise.Conduct experiments, gather real-world data, and refine AI practices based on outcomes.Ensure human oversight and ethical responsibility in all AI-driven processes.This approach ensures AI serves as a complement to human skill, fostering innovation while maintaining accountability.","Sridhar vembu is the co-founder and chief scientist of zoho corporation.

Speaking in a recent ‘Decoder’ podcast, the GitHub CEO said that it is clear that GitHub is non-negotiable for employees at the company. “There is no world where I would allow employees to say, ‘Well, sorry, I don’t want to use GitHub.’ If that is the case, you can go work somewhere else.” This rule of the company highlights GitHub’s commitment to its own platform which hosts more than 1 billion repositories and also serve more than 150 million developers globally.According to a report by Business Insider, during the recent podcast interview, Thomas Dohmke said that it is a rule at GitHub that all the employees will use the platform. The rule applies to everyone from developers to HR professionals. “There is no world where I would allow for somebody to say, 'Well, sorry, I don't want to use GitHub.'

Nvidia’s China crisis

Lava Blaze AMOLED 2: Budget Smartphone with Mid-Range Vibes

The ongoing dispute surrounding Nvidia’s H20 AI chip sales to China has now intensified discussions about US-China technology arms race . A recent online report revealed that China is pursuing its major tech companies like Alibaba and ByteDance to reconsider their orders for Nvidia’s H20 AI chips even as Chinese regulators have asked tech firms to explain why they are purchasing Nvidia’s chips – which US President Donald Trump called ‘obsolete’ – instead of using domestic alternatives, suggesting that they want the Chinese tech companies to downsize their orders of H20 chips.Following this ongoing controversy, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a blunt warning about America’s vulnerability in the global tech arms race. As reported by Financial Review, speaking at the Reagan National Economic Forum, Dimon called it “a little embarrassing” that the U.S. allowed 100% of its penicillin supply and critical tech components to come from China. “It’s a little embarrassing that we as a nation allowed 100% of our penicillin to come from China, and all of our rare earths, and all of our advanced chipmaking tools,” Dimon said. “We need to get our act together.”On being asked about the technology arms race between US and China, Jamie Dimon mentioned that it was an important miliarty issue as US cannot allow the sale of a chip to China which is designed to make powerful AI systems.Dimon also talked about the dependence of America on foreign nations for essential goods and technology. ""It’s a little embarrassing that we as a nation allowed 100 per cent of our Penicillin to come from China, and all of the rare earth [metals],"" Dimon said.Talking about the ongoing chip dispute, Dimon added that “You don’t want to give them the chips which will make their supersonic missiles better.”Dimon also emphasised that America cannot stop China but can definitely slow them down. “we should be specific about the things that protect us, and technology is a big piece of that,” said Dimon.Dimon’s remarks come as a Nvidia’s H20 chips, designed specifically for the Chinese market, face mounting scrutiny from Beijing. Recently, Chinese regulators summoned Nvidia representatives over alleged security risks related to Nvidia H20 AI chips . However, later Nvidia publicly asserted that its chips contain ""no backdoors, no kill switches, and no spyware.""In a blog post shared, Nvidia’s chief security officer David Reber has vehemently denied the accusations of Chinese government alleging security risks in H20. “There is no such thing as a ‘good’ secret backdoor — only dangerous vulnerabilities that need to be eliminated,” wrote Reber in the blog post. He argued that it would ""undermine global digital infrastructure and fracture trust in US technology.Now the China is asking its tech companies to reconsider their orders for Nvidia’s H20 AI chips. According to a report by Financial Times, the development comes as various Chinese companies have been told to avoid using these AI chips, particularly for government-related projects.This move complicates the recent export arrangement Nvidia made with the Trump administration, which allowed the chips to be sold in China under the condition of a revenue-sharing agreement. According to White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, the Trump administration is still finalising the details of its agreement to collect a 15% export tax on revenue from Nvidia and AMD's chip sales to China.","Jpmorgan chase ceo jamie dimon has issued a blunt warning about america’s vulnerability in the global tech arms race.

"‘One language, one voice’: Trump admin enforces English-only policy; Housing Dept removes translated material from website",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/one-language-one-voice-trump-admin-enforces-english-only-policy-housing-dept-removes-translated-material-from-website/articleshow/123350095.cms,"Department of Housing and Urban Development (Image: X/@HUDgov)





The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) is moving to make English the sole language for nearly all of its services and operations, New York Post reported quoting an internal memo.HUD Deputy Secretary Andrew Hughes wrote that the policy shift follows President Trump’s March executive order declaring English the official language of the United States. The memo, to be sent Monday, instructs HUD leadership to begin implementing the changes immediately.“We are one people, united, and we will speak with one voice and one language to deliver on our mission of expanding housing that is affordable, helping those in need, caring for our most vulnerable Americans, and revitalizing rural, tribal, and urban communities,” the memo read.The policy does include limited exceptions. HUD will still provide translation services in cases required by law, such as under the Americans with Disabilities Act or the Violence Against Women Act. The department will also continue to provide accommodations for people who are hearing- or vision-impaired.“HUD will continue to ensure that all persons have meaningful access to HUD programs and services,” Hughes stressed, adding that the department also “will continue to provide communication services to the hearing and seeing impaired, and persons with related disabilities.”Until now, HUD supported translation into more than 200 languages and even operated a dedicated interpretation line for immigrants with limited English proficiency. That approach began under President Bill Clinton in 2001, who signed an executive order to expand language access to federal services.Trump’s executive order revoked Clinton’s directive and HUD officials say rolling back translation services will cut costs. It noted that “nothing in this order, however, requires or directs any change in the services provided by any agency.”Hughes directed that all non-English materials be removed from HUD offices and websites and replaced with English-only versions. The new changes at department are set to be “effective immediately”.“All HUD communications, correspondence, and physical and digital published materials will be produced exclusively in English and that we will no longer offer non-English translation services,” Hughes’ memo states.“Additionally, please immediately remove all printed or digital collateral about non-English translation services currently displayed in HUD offices or HUD-funded facilities. Printed or digital collateral not in English can be replaced with an English-only version.”The justice department issued guidance to all federal agencies last month on implementing Trump’s executive order. It plans to release updated instructions in about six months, along with a public comment period to consider possible revisions.",Department of housing and urban development is moving to make english the sole language for nearly all of its services and operations.

"China push: In Nepal, EVs now account for 76% of all vehicles sold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/china-push-in-nepal-evs-now-account-for-76-of-all-vehicles-sold/articleshow/122960428.cms,"



KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Ev market share in nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including norway, singapore and ethiopia.

Four men in Northampton, England, raced away from an Indian restaurant without paying their 200-pound (about Rs 21,000) bill, which led to a spectacular chase by the staff. According to a Daily Mail article, the event took place in the Saffron restaurant at around 10.11 pm on August 4.Men can be seen entering the restaurant in the widely circulated CCTV footage posted on Instagram. Later in the video, they can be seen rushing out of the restaurant's door after leaving their table. When they reveal their intent, a staff member may be seen pursuing them. According to the complaint by the eatery, those men ordered and consumed 197.30 pounds of food, which included lamb chops, several curries, and other dishes.The company later posted the bill on Facebook. The bill breakdown included four plain poppadoms for £5.60, one chutney tray for £2.20, two chargrilled lamb chops for £24.00, three chicken chat dishes for £30.00, two chicken tikka mains for £28.00, two chicken tikka masalas for £32.00, two boiled rice portions for £11.00, two garlic naans for £12.00, three chapatis for £12.00, one serving of chips for £4.50, and nine 330 ml glass bottles of Coke for £36.00.Police in Northamptonshire acknowledged that they are looking into the event as a possible theft.""This kind of behavior isn't just theft; it affects hardworking small businesses and our local community,"" they wrote in a Facebook post.Online, the post generated a range of responses. ""Eat at home if you can't afford it! One user asked, ""Why are people these days so lazy to cook?""“This is why you swipe a card before they’re seated.

National strategy







The world's inaugural humanoid robot games commenced Friday in Beijing, featuring over 500 androids competing in events ranging from the 100-metre hurdles to kung fu. Hundreds of robotics teams from 16 countries vied for gold at the Chinese capital's National Speed Skating Oval, constructed for the 2022 Winter Olympics.The games encompassed traditional sports such as athletics and basketball, alongside practical tasks including medicine categorisation and cleaning. ""I believe in the next 10 years or so, robots will be basically at the same level as humans,"" enthusiastic 18-year-old spectator Chen Ruiyuan told AFP.Human athletes may not be intimidated at this stage. During one of the initial events on Friday morning, five-aside football saw ten robots the size of seven-year-olds maneuver around the pitch, frequently becoming entangled in scrums or toppling over en masse.However, in a 1500-metre race, domestic champion Unitree's humanoids maintained an impressive pace, easily surpassing their competitors. The fastest robot AFP observed completed the race in 6:29:37, considerably slower than the human men's world record of 3:26:00. In one incident, a mechanical racer crashed into a human operator. The robot remained upright, while the human was knocked to the ground but did not appear to be injured.Robot competitions have been held for decades, but the 2025 World Humanoid Robot Games marks the first to concentrate specifically on robots that resemble human bodies, organisers stated.The Chinese govt has invested heavily in robotics with the aim of leading the industry. Beijing has placed humanoids at the ""centre of their national strategy,"" the International Federation of Robotics stated in a paper on Thursday.""The govt wants to showcase its competence and global competitiveness in this field of technology,"" it added. Authorities are endeavouring to raise awareness of the sector across society.Cui Han, accompanying her 10-year-old son, told AFP that her son's school had organised and funded the trip to the Games. ""I hope it will encourage him to learn more about these new technologies,"" she said. In March, China announced plans for a one-trillion-yuan (approx Rs 1,22,000 crore) fund to support technology startups, including those in robotics and AI. The country is already the world's largest market for industrial robots, official statistics indicate, and in April, Beijing held what organisers described as the world's first humanoid robot half-marathon.","World's inaugural humanoid robot games commenced friday in beijing, featuring over 500 androids.

UAE: What are Certificates of Origin and how Abu Dhabi’s 10.3% rise proves a shift from oil dependence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-what-are-certificates-of-origin-and-how-abu-dhabis-10-3-rise-proves-a-shift-from-oil-dependence/articleshow/123344112.cms,"Certificates of Origin certify that goods are produced in a specific country, essential for customs, tariffs, and export compliance/ Image: File

Certificates of Origin: Their role and relevance

Growth in COO issuance reflects rising export momentum





Strategic implications for Abu Dhabi’s economy

Institutional role of the Abu Dhabi Chamber





The Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce and Industry has reported a significant increase in the issuance of Certificates of Origin over the past year. This development highlights the emirate’s growing industrial base, increased trade activity, and a steadily advancing economic diversification strategy aimed at reducing dependence on oil exports.A Certificate of Origin (COO) serves as an official document confirming that the goods in a shipment are wholly obtained, produced, manufactured, or processed in a specific country. These certificates are vital tools in international trade, helping businesses clear customs, determine applicable tariffs, and comply with import regulations in target markets.In Saudi Arabia and across the GCC, a valid COO is often mandatory for both exports and imports. Without it, companies risk facing shipment delays, regulatory penalties, or outright rejection of goods. In this context, chambers of commerce, such as the one in Abu Dhabi, play a central role, acting as accredited bodies authorised to issue these certificates.Between June 2024 and June 2025, the Abu Dhabi Chamber recorded a 10.3 percent increase in the number of COOs issued. This growth signals a wider and more active base of local exporters, as well as heightened economic activity across non-oil sectors.The Chamber attributes this uptick to Abu Dhabi’s expanding industrial capacity and its growing reputation as a key regional player in trade and investment.Sectorally, the bulk of these COOs were issued to businesses involved in chemicals, metals, and engineering — all areas that point to a robust and diversified manufacturing ecosystem. Notably, small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) have shown increased participation in export activities, driven by support mechanisms provided by the Chamber. These include specialised training programs, business matchmaking efforts, and collaboration with regional and international trade entities.The broader export landscape also aligns with these trends. During the first half of 2025, Abu Dhabi’s non-oil foreign trade surged by 34.7 percent. Within that, non-oil exports leapt by 64 percent, re-exports grew by 35 percent, and imports rose by 15 percent. These figures build on the previous year’s performance, which also saw strong growth: non-oil trade rose by 9 percent, exports increased by 16 percent, and imports by 3 percent.The increasing number of Certificates of Origin being issued by the Abu Dhabi Chamber is seen by its leadership as a strong indicator of export sector vitality and a reflection of the emirate’s deepening integration with global trade networks. Shamis Al Dhaheri, Second Vice Chairman and Managing Director of the Chamber, considers this sustained rise as clear proof of the competitiveness of Abu Dhabi-based companies and their growing capacity to enter and thrive in international markets.Al Dhaheri has attributed this momentum not only to market confidence in locally produced goods but also to the Chamber’s continued investment in supporting export-ready businesses. He noted that Abu Dhabi companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, are increasingly leveraging the Chamber’s services, including export training, market access programs, and strategic trade partnerships, to expand their global footprint.He also emphasized that the Chamber is focused on enabling exporters to benefit from customs advantages provided by bilateral and multilateral agreements. With COOs validating the national origin of goods, UAE products are better positioned to benefit from preferential trade terms, giving them a more competitive edge in international markets.According to him, the Chamber views Certificates of Origin as more than just administrative tools; they are gateways to new economic opportunities. He pointed to the Chamber’s ongoing efforts to enhance its digital infrastructure and to advocate for the private sector as part of a broader strategy to make Abu Dhabi’s economy more resilient and globally connected.Al Dhaheri underlined that the current indicators affirm not just the strength of the Chamber’s services, but also the private sector’s rising contribution to national economic goals. The increase in export activity, particularly among SMEs, is seen as a tangible outcome of the emirate’s diversification agenda and its efforts to reduce dependency on oil revenues.Founded in 1969 by an Emiri decree issued by the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the Abu Dhabi Chamber of Commerce and Industry was established to promote and protect the interests of businesses operating in the emirate. Over the decades, it has evolved into a central platform for dialogue between the private sector and the government, supporting enterprise development across sectors.The Chamber hosts frequent trade delegations, policy discussions, and cross-border business forums. These activities help reinforce Abu Dhabi’s global standing and attract foreign direct investment. Recognised by the leadership and business community alike, the Chamber’s programs serve as key enablers of the emirate’s economic ambitions.In line with this mission, the Chamber continues to invest in improving its digital infrastructure and expanding its export-related services. It views the recent growth in COOs not just as a positive trade indicator, but as a sign of resilience, adaptability, and growing maturity within Abu Dhabi’s private sector.","A certificate of origin (coo) serves as an official document confirming that the goods in a shipment are wholly obtained, produced, manufactured, or processed in a specific country.

The Ministry of Justice in Saudi Arabia has formally launched a centralized translation service through its e-Litigation platform, streamlining all judicial translation processes to support efficient legal communication and case handling.The Unified Translation Center is now operational on the e-Litigation platform, enabling centralized management of judicial translation requests. The service encompasses the entire translation process, from the initial request by a beneficiary to completion, within a single digital workflow.The platform automates the receipt of translation requests, which can originate from lawsuits or judicial departments, and coordinates their assignment to translators. It also provides tools for monitoring and supervision, ensuring the status of each request can be tracked throughout its lifecycle.The integration allows beneficiaries, such as litigants, legal representatives, and courts, to follow the progress of their translation requests step-by-step, aiming to improve the quality, speed, and efficiency of translation services within judicial procedures.The Unified Translation Center, under the Ministry of Justice, offers remote interpretation services for non-Arabic speakers during court hearings.By utilizing videoconferencing and the e-Litigation system, interpreters, including those specializing in sign language, can assist in real time, ensuring accurate understanding between judicial panels and individuals involved in legal proceedings who do not speak Arabic.This initiative was launched with a clear goal: to eliminate communication barriers in courtrooms and legal environments, providing transparent interpretation to safeguard due process and individual rights. It emphasizes accuracy and ensures that non-Arabic speakers are given full clarity and participation during legal procedures.The Najiz platform, which serves as the Ministry of Justice’s unified digital services portal, hosts the translation functionality. In August 2023, the Ministry introduced a dedicated feature on Najiz titled “Request for an Interpreter”. This allows non-Arabic speaking users to request translation services directly online.Najiz is part of a broader effort by the Ministry to provide comprehensive judicial services digitally, aimed at improving user experience and service accessibility.The Ministry of Justice is one of the most longstanding government entities in Saudi Arabia. Established by Royal Order in 1962, the Ministry was tasked with overseeing all courts and fulfilling their administrative and financial needs. Although it was founded in 1962, the Ministry began executing its formal duties in 1970 under the leadership of the first appointed Minister of Justice, Mohammed Bin Ali al-Harkhan, who served until 1975.Among all ministries under the Council of Ministers, the Ministry of Justice is one of only three that has never undergone a name change, merger, or dissolution, the others being the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Health. The Ministry is headquartered in Riyadh and is managed by a Minister appointed via Royal Order, who also holds membership in the Council of Ministers.The broader modernization of judicial services, including digital translation and litigation processes, is aligned with the national transformation program Saudi Vision 2030. The Ministry’s active reform phase began after the first meeting of the Council of Economic and Development Affairs in 2016, where His Royal Highness Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, Crown Prince and Prime Minister, launched the Vision.As part of this alignment, the Ministry of Justice adopted thirteen strategic goals, all contributing to systemic improvements across its various sectors.These sectors include:Each plays a role in transforming legal services to be more efficient, accessible, and aligned with global standards.","The unified translation center is now operational on the e-litigation platform, enabling centralized management of judicial translation requests.
