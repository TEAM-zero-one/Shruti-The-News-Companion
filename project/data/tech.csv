Debut debacle: It’s raining startup IPOs but stock prices are in slump,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/debut-debacle-its-raining-startup-ipos-but-stock-prices-are-in-slump/articleshow/126446165.cms,".

MUMBAI: Even as startups are increasingly rushing to Dalal Street, buoyed by a booming primary market, many of the large, listed companies are trading below their IPO offer price, raising concerns over the long-term value they can generate for investors.Stock prices of close to 10 startups including Swiggy, FirstCry, Paytm, Ola Electric and Delhivery are trading below their offer price, data sourced from the exchanges and Prime Database showed (see graphic) . While market volatility and a broader correction have somewhat had a bearing, a bigger overhang has been the tepid growth of the companies which failed to keep pace with the expectations of the street, said analysts tracking the space.“The realisation (on part of investors) that performance is not meeting expectations is resulting in disappointment and value correction,” said Nikunj Doshi, of Bay Capital. For many startups, acquisitions have been the way of reporting topline growth but whether they are getting reflected in the bottom line remains to be seen, said Doshi.Since 2021, over 30 startups have debuted on the exchanges, ditching larger private fundraises as regulatory easing and higher valuations in public markets made it smoother for firms to go for an IPO.Following a clutch of billiondollar startup listings floated by players such as Lenskart, Groww and Meesho last year, PhonePe, Zepto, Oyo and Flipkart, among others are gearing up for a debut in 2026.To be fair, most of the recently listed startups are trading above their offer price, but analysts said that the performance of digital companies should be weighed after six months of listing. “These companies are largely funded by VC, PE/HNI investors whose lock in expires after six months of listing and the floodgates of supply open. Some startups saw correction in their prices after six months,” said Doshi. A lock-in expiry is the time when restrictions on selling share ends, allowing shareholders to sell their stakes, increasing supply in secondary market which can be difficult to absorb.Public market valuations for tech-led businesses have meaningfully reset from the peak cycle. For instance, in the case of high-quality SaaS companies, which were earlier trading at mid-teens revenue multiples, current market benchmarks are materially lower, reflecting both multiple compression and a moderation in growth rate versus earlier expectations, said Mehekka Oberoi, fund manager at IIFL Fintech Fund. The next batch of startups may have to list at lower valuations compared to their last private fundings.","Stock prices of close to 10 startups including swiggy, firstcry, paytm, ola electric and delhivery are trading below their offer price.

My Two Cents On This Mock Trade

The Philadelphia Phillies are preparing for the possibility that J.T. Realmuto will not return for 2026. Contract talks have not moved, and pitchers and catchers are close to reporting. With no clear answer yet, the team is looking at alternatives.One name that keeps coming up is Ryan Jeffers of the Minnesota Twins. The Phillies see him as a realistic option if Realmuto leaves in free agency. His age, contract status, and recent production make him a practical target rather than a splash move.JT Realmuto is 35 and coming off a quieter season at the plate. Even so, his track record means other teams are interested, and his next contract is expected to be expensive. That has pushed the Philadelphia Phillies to explore the trade market rather than wait and react late.Jeffers fits what the Phillies are looking for. He is younger, costs far less, and is under team control for 2026 through arbitration. At $6.7 million, he would give the team stability behind the plate without locking them into a long-term deal.Ryan Jeffers brings power that plays well at catcher and steady defense.In 2025, he produced a strong OPS and handled his defensive duties cleanly. While he does not match Realmuto’s arm or speed, he offers reliable all-around play and is entering his prime years.For the Phillies, he would be a bridge option. They stay competitive now while keeping future flexibility.A possible deal would send outfielder Justin Crawford and pitcher Gage Wood to Minnesota. Crawford is one of the Philadelphia Phillies’ top prospects, and Wood adds pitching depth. The Twins are looking to restock with young talent after recent roster changes, and this type of return fits that goal.The deal would not require Philadelphia to move a big-league contract, keeping the payroll clean.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Chicago Cubs predicted to pursue $33 million Toronto Blue Jays star infielder post blockbuster Edward Cabrera deal Philadelphia would get a younger, cheaper catcher who can start right away. Minnesota would turn a player nearing free agency into long-term pieces. If Realmuto moves on, Jeffers is a sensible next step rather than a risky gamble.","The philadelphia phillies are preparing for the possibility that j.t. Realmuto will not return for 2026.

Investor concerns beyond Jeff Bezos







Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’, even he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society. Recently, speaking at the Italian Tech Week alongside Exor CEO John Elkann, Bezos said that the excitement around AI has led to unusual investor behaviour, with billions of dollars flowing into companies regardless strong fundamentals.Bezos explained that bubbles are characterised by inflated stock prices and a rush of funding into both good and bad ideas. This makes it difficult for the investor to distinguish.Bezos further outlined the hallmarks of bubbles. He said that the current AI climate as one where “every experiment or idea gets funded,” even if the fundamentals are weak. He pointed to unusual behavior such as small companies with only a handful of employees receiving billions of dollars in investment. This, he said, is a hallmark of industrial bubbles, where excitement drives capital into ventures indiscriminately.Despite this caution, Bezos feels that the technology itself is genuine and transformative. “AI is real, and it is going to change every industry,” he told the audience. He further compared the situation to the biotech bubble of the 1990s, which witnessed many companies fail but ultimately produced some life-saving drugs. Industrial bubbles, he argued, are not necessarily harmful; when the dust settles, society benefits from the inventions that survive.Bezos’ remarks echo a growing chorus of warnings from business leaders. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has previously said the AI market is in a bubble. At the same event in Turin, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon cautioned that investor excitement often overlooks risks, predicting a “reset” or “drawdown” in valuations. Similarly, Karim Moussalem, chief investment officer at Selwood Asset Management, recently said the AI trade is beginning to resemble “one of the great speculative manias of market history. ”","Amazon founder jeff bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’ however, even he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society.

He argues current models are commoditized and true value lies in securely accessing and reasoning over sensitive company information. Oracle is investing heavily, leveraging its vast database presence to become the enterprise AI backbone, facing competition from cloud rivals.

Oracle bets big on becoming the enterprise AI backbone

The race for private data access heats up





Oracle founder and CTO Larry Ellison has identified what he calls the critical limitation holding back AI models from Gemini to ChatGPT: they're all trained on the same publicly available internet data, making them increasingly commoditized with little real differentiation between them.Speaking during Oracle's fiscal Q2 2026 earnings call in December, Ellison argued that while training foundational models on public data has created ""the largest and fastest-growing business in human history,"" the real value lies ahead in a second phase: enabling these models to securely reason over private enterprise data without compromising security.""For these models to reach their peak value, you need to train them not just on publicly available data, but make privately owned data available for those models as well,"" Ellison said. He estimates this next phase will prove ""even larger and more valuable"" than the current GPU and data center boom.Oracle is positioning itself as uniquely equipped for this shift. The company points out that most of the world's high-value private data already lives in Oracle databases. Its AI Data Platform uses techniques like Retrieval-Augmented Generation to let any major AI model query private data in real-time while maintaining security.The company is backing this vision with aggressive spending, projecting roughly $50 billion in capital expenditures for the full year, up from $35 billion estimated in September. At Oracle AI World in October, the company announced partnerships including a 50,000-GPU AI supercluster with AMD MI450 chips launching in Q3 2026, and the OCI Zettascale10 supercomputer connecting hundreds of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs.Ellison's thesis faces challenges from multiple angles. Synthetic data generation could reduce dependence on exclusive proprietary data sets; real-time user interaction data from consumer apps could turn out to be more valuable than static enterprise records. At the same time, rivals like Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are racing to develop comparable enterprise AI capabilities, though Oracle argues its established grip on enterprise databases gives it a strategic advantage. By late 2025, the company's cloud backlog had topped $500 billion, driven mostly by demand for AI.","Oracle's larry ellison believes ai's next frontier is private enterprise data.

Nvidia’s Alpamayo to debut with Mercedes CLA





At the ongoing Consumer Electronics Show (CES), Nvidia launched Alpamayo – an open source AI model for autonomous vehicles. Announcing the new AI model, CEO Jensen Huang said that it is the world’s first thinking, reasoning autonomous vehicle AI. He further revealed that the Alpamayo is launching on US roads later this year, starting with the Mercedes CLA. “Alpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments, and explain their driving decisions,” he further added. Responding to one such posts about the autonomous vehicle AI, Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote:“Well that’s just exactly what Tesla is doing 😂 What they will find is that it’s easy to get to 99% and then super hard to solve the long tail of the distribution.”Alpamayo introduces Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models designed for self-driving systems. The models will allow autonomous vehicles to understand visual inputs, assess driving situations and decide on driving actions. The platform also includes large reasoning models, simulation tools to test rare or unusual driving situations, and open datasets that can be used for training and validation.Talking about Alpamayo, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement that “The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is here – when machines begin to understand, reason, and act in the real world”.“It's trained end-to-end. Literally from camera in to actuation out; It reasons what action it is about to take, the reason by which it came about that action, and the trajectory”, he added.""With a 10-billion-parameter architecture, Alpamayo 1 uses video input to generate trajectories alongside reasoning traces, showing the logic behind each decision. Developers can adapt Alpamayo 1 into smaller runtime models for vehicle development, or use it as a foundation for AV development tools such as reasoning-based evaluators and auto-labeling systems. Alpamayo 1 provides open model weights and open-source inferencing scripts. Future models in the family will feature larger parameter counts, more detailed reasoning capabilities, more input and output flexibility, and options for commercial usage,"" he continued.As mentioned above, Nvidia has partnered with Mercedes to bring its autonomous vehicle AI. Announcing the partnership, the chip maker said “NVIDIA is enabling a new era of AI-defined driving, bringing its NVIDIA DRIVE AV software with enhanced level 2 point-to-point driver assistance capabilities to U.S. roads, expected by end of this year — starting with Mercedes-Benz, a long-standing partner in advancing safe, intelligent mobility. ”“The all-new Mercedes-Benz CLA — the brand’s first vehicle featuring the MB.OS platform — introduces advanced driver-assistance features powered by NVIDIA’s full-stack DRIVE AV software, AI infrastructure and accelerated compute.This design may enable over-the-air updates of future upgrades and new features, including planned enhancements to MB.DRIVE ASSIST PRO, which may be available ex-factory and through the Mercedes-Benz store.”","Nvidia’s alpamayo to debut with mercedes cla later this year.

EXPOSED: Mark Zuckerberg Embarrassed on Hot Mic Admitting Total Confusion During Trump Dinner





Ever since Mark Zuckerberg announced the creation of Meta Superintelligence Labs in first half of 2025, Meta CEO has been on an AI hiring blitz. A Twitter user who goes by the moniker @HinataMotivates, said to be a tech-motivation account, shared a podcast clip (going back to 2022) where Zuckerberg talks about Meta hiring rule and his advice for college students. Mark Zuckerberg has a hiring rule that he says is cardinal for him while hiring anyone and the one that he says is also an important tip for any college student. In an episode of the “Lex Fridman Podcast,” hosted by MIT computer scientist Lex Fridman, Zuckerberg said that most people know Facebook ’s dorm-room origin story and that many have learned the wrong lesson from it. He said that his initial ability to launch Facebook wasn’t because he dropped out of college. According to Zuckerberg, it was due to the personal connections he made while he was still in school.Who you spend time with in college, Zuckerberg said, is “the most important decision” any student can make in college. He advised college students that choosing their social circle is the most pivotal decision, as people tend to emulate those around them. “You become the people you surround yourself with,” he said in the podcast.“I think probably people are too, in general, objective focused, and maybe not focused enough on the connections and the people who they’re basically building relationships [with]. ” Meta CEO Zuckerberg is said to have met his Facebook co-founders ⁠— Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes and Andrew McCollum ⁠— while the five were students at Harvard University.While the group split up in a not-so-happy manner, Zuckerberg said on the podcast that he tries to prioritize relationships over objectives. This applies especially to hiring. Zuckerberg said that he extends the idea to his Meta hiring philosophy: He only employs candidates he did hypothetically work for, underscoring reciprocity and alignment in professional networks. When evaluating a job candidate, he imagines what it would be like to work for that person. “I will only hire someone to work for me if I can see myself working for them,” he said.Mark Zuckerberg said that the strategy creates a work environment that’s both more cohesive and more productive: If you work with people who share your values on a human level, you’ll be more likely to smoothly achieve your work goals together. It’s all about finding personal compatibility, he said, not unlike “choosing friends or a partner.”","Mark zuckerberg has a hiring rule that he says is cardinal for him while hiring anyone.

Zoho senior engineer ships three-week projects in one day





Zoho founder and Chief Scientist Sridhar Vembu has revealed that one of his engineers recently built a sophisticated assembly and machine code security tool alone in just one month—work that would typically require a team of three to four developers an entire year. The breakthrough, Vembu disclosed on X, came after the engineer discovered Anthropic's Claude Opus 4.5 model, which he called a ""game changer"" that finally convinced him AI-generated code was worth using.""I did not know he was building it. I was blown away by the depth and breadth of the tool,"" Vembu wrote, describing how the experienced developer from his R&D team created the project in his spare time. The Zoho founder characterized the moment as the arrival of ""powerful machine looms for software development,"" comparing the disruption to how mechanized weaving once challenged traditional handloom workers.The productivity gains extend across Zoho's engineering organization. Vembu shared that one of the company's most productive engineers—a veteran with two decades of experience handling performance-critical UI work—is now completing in a single day what previously took three weeks. ""AI needed him to provide the structure, it fleshed out the details and that required him to draw on his experience,"" Vembu explained.The Indian SaaS giant has rolled out AI coding tools company-wide but with strict guardrails. Engineers must review and approve all AI-generated code and take full responsibility for it, Vembu emphasized. Zoho doesn't mandate AI usage, instead leaving implementation decisions to experienced developers who can assess when the technology adds value.Even junior developers are seeing breakthroughs. Vembu noted that a less experienced team member built an internal tool with AI assistance that's now being used across multiple teams—work that wouldn't have been possible without the technology. For UI development specifically, Vembu's team is ""very bullish on AI.""""As Chief Scientist, I am under pressure,"" Vembu admitted, acknowledging the technology's transformative impact.

Lower cost and faster AI processing

Elon Musk on Nvidia’s Rubin AI chip





Nvidia has unveiled its next-generation AI computing platform, called Vera Rubin, at the ongoing Consumer Electronics Show (CES) 2026 in Las Vegas. The announcement was made by Nvidia founder and CEO Jensen Huang, who said the new platform is now in full production. Rubin is designed to support large-scale artificial intelligence workloads and is aimed at data centres, cloud providers and enterprises building advanced AI systems. Nvidia said the platform is built to lower the cost of AI computing and support faster training and deployment of AI models. Rubin succeeds Nvidia’s Blackwell architecture and is part of the company’s broader push to expand AI use across industries.Vera Rubin is Nvidia’s first six-chip AI platform developed using an “extreme codesign” approach, where multiple components are designed together. The platform includes Rubin GPUs, Vera CPUs, NVLink 6 networking, Spectrum-X Ethernet Photonics, ConnectX-9 networking cards and BlueField-4 data processing units. Nvidia said this design helps reduce bottlenecks and improve performance for large AI workloads.The Rubin GPU delivers up to 50 petaflops of inference performance using NVFP4 precision. The Vera CPU is designed to handle data movement and AI agent processing tasks. Nvidia said the platform is built to support large-scale AI training and inference more efficiently.According to Nvidia, the Rubin platform can reduce the cost of generating AI tokens to about one-tenth of previous platforms. The company also introduced an AI-focused storage system called Inference Context Memory Storage, which is designed to improve long-context AI processing by increasing speed and efficiency.Nvidia said the Rubin platform will be used alongside its open AI models and software tools to support applications in areas such as autonomous driving, robotics, healthcare and climate research.The announcement was shared by an X user Sawyer Merritt who also shared a video of the chip maker’s next-generation Rubin chips. Responding to the post, Musk said “It will take another 9 months or so before the hardware is operational at scale and the software works well”, highlighting deployment realities beyond raw power claims.","Vera rubin is nvidia’s first six-chip ai platform developed using an ‘extreme codesign’ approach, where multiple components are designed together.

Vivek Ramaswamy’s old take on caste surfaces on Twitter after he quits social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/vivek-ramaswamys-old-take-on-caste-surfaces-on-twitter-after-he-quits-social-media/articleshow/126443298.cms,"Usha Vance J**t Slur Sparks Firestorm: Vivek Ramaswamy’s Outburst Splits MAGA | ‘You Have No Place…’

How social media takes things out of context

America's evolving caste debate





Current Ohio gubernatorial candidate and former Republican presidential candidate, Vivek Ramaswamy recently went into a social media exile, announcing his decision to quit his personal social media accounts on X (Formerly Twitter) and Instagram. Citing the reasons that modern social media is becoming ""increasingly disconnected from the electorate"" and the messages being ""negative and bombastic,"" he shared the decision in an op-ed published in The Wall Street Journal on Monday.At the same time, an excerpt from his 2021 book 'Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam' has resurfaced on Twitter and has been circulating all over the social media app. A post on the app, shared a photo of the excerpt written back in the day, highlighting Ramaswamy's description of Indian caste society and his experience with it. What followed was a familiar social media cycle: selective emphasis, rising outrage, and a narrative that quickly hardened into accusation.""Did you know that @VivekGRamaswamy was born into the highest caste of Indian, so special even royalty is below him? That his childhood servants can't walk through the same doors as him? That he wears a magic rope ""Poonal"" so he can be special even when naked?,"" called out the post, inciting numerous X users into criticising the politician.The post, which has received 94.3K views on the social media app, had parts of the excerpt strategically underlined to create a narrative where Ramaswamy boasted of himself being Brahmin, the highest caste in the Hindu society and that the people who provided service to his family were of the lower caste and entered the house through different gates. That every person who was a part of the society understood its values and principles. It portrays Ramaswamy as an extremely proud casteist, thus leading to comments such as: ""talking about discrimination with zero knowledge"" and "" Vivek is quite literally the worst type of human.""The book which the excerpt belongs to was published back in 2021 and was Ramaswamy's debut as an author. What the post described as a casteist lens is actually an attempt to explain a larger subject through a more comprehensible and personal anecdote.'Woke, Inc.' is a book about American corporate identity politics and caste is used as an illustrative example, not the subject. In the writing, Ramaswamy clearly explains how hierarchy does not always align with wealth or power across societies.He gives the example of an Indian society, mentioning the four castes, Brahmins the priests, Kshatriyas the kings, Vaishyas the commercial class and Shudras the service caste.He added that caste was a description of social and occupational hierarchy. Brahmins were obligated to pursue knowledge, which didn't come with money or political power. Thus, his grandfather worked as a farm manager, his father as an engineer and his uncle as a doctor. Social customs required the caste to wear a sacred string, Poonal, which was a cultural marker of caste, not a symbol of power.He shared the anecdote of his domestic help who lived with them like relatives and was respected just like family members, unbeknownst as a child that they belonged to a said lower caste. The distinction, he argues, was social rather than economic, a legacy of inherited norms rather than personal animus.It was these social values that led to the formation of rules. They were unfair, but for the people at the time they were associated with a 'proper understanding of the world'.Higher social rank did not mean an escape from the economic troubles for anyone who was a part of the society. The excerpt was a description, not the norm. But reading only the underlined parts of it could have anyone carrying a brick and walking towards the political leader.Numerous times social media screenshots are taken out of context, especially when they are targeted at non-Indian audiences who lack the social context. Explanations are reduced to screenshots, writings to advocacy and context disappears.Caste has become politicised in parts of the US, especially California. Back in 2023, Senate Bill 403 or SB403 was passed by the state legislature to explicitly ban caste discrimination. Although the bill was vetoed by Governor Gavin Newsom, it reflected growing concern about caste dynamics within South Asian immigrant communities, by adding caste as a protected class to the state's existing anti-discrimination laws.The same year Seattle became the first US city to outlaw caste discrimination with followed by Fresno. As per activists, the issue is more prominent in Americans of Indian descent and Hindus. Since most of them move to Silicon Valley and California, these places confront the issue of caste discrimination.But is it true? A 2018 report from Equality Labs, a California-based non-profit, stated that 25% of Dalit respondents said they had faced verbal or physical assault based on their caste; 50% of Dalits live in fear of their caste being outed; 67% reported being treated unfairly at their workplace.However, the survey was web-based, self-reported, and conducted among respondents already engaged with anti-caste advocacy.By contrast, a report by the Carnegie Foundation and YouGov, found only 1% of Hindu Indian Americans who identified themselves with a caste were Dalit. 80% of Hindus in America who identified with a caste, are upper caste. Of those Indian Americans who are Hindu, 50% have almost no friends from the same caste as themselves. Thus, caste is not how they self-segregate or identify each other.It is acts like these which substantiate Ramaswamy's quitting of social media. Circulating an old excerpt without proper clarification attempts to feed into the ""caste war"" narratives and makes social media a negative and bombastic place, as he described.This is not about the current situation of India or about Ramaswamy's current views and opinions. It is about how context can be distorted to manufacture conflict—particularly between cultures—through selective framing.","Ohio gubernatorial candidate and former republican presidential candidate, vivek ramaswamy recently went into a social media exile.

Opening in the year 2026, the world is confronted with economic instability, record inflation levels, and a cost-of-living crisis. But for the elite few, it all just seems much less important to their bank accounts. Today, the combined fortune of the world's 14 richest men tops over $3 trillion across technology, luxury, fashion, AI, and investments. Elon Musk stays ahead in this league for the fifth consecutive year, with a mind-numbing $717.9 billion fortune that has almost doubled within the past couple of years. In contrast, newcomers join this league as a result of AI and semiconductor storms and planned investments. The symbolic wealth levels of these influential few stand in contrast to the increasing difference between the problems within the world and the super-rich.As of 2026, the world’s wealthiest men continue to amass staggering fortunes despite global economic challenges. According to Forbes, the top 10 richest men, led by Elon Musk, now hold combined wealth exceeding $3 trillion, dominating sectors from technology and AI to luxury, fashion, and global investments, reshaping markets, influencing policy, driving innovation, and redefining modern economic power.Elon Musk, Tesla, SpaceX, and X’s CEO, sustains his dominance in the list of global billionaires.The value of Musk's net worth escalated from 2021’s $300 billion to 2026's $717.9 billion because of the phenomenal performance of electric cars, space exploration, and social media reach. Musk's entry and eventual support or endorsement of Donald Trump in politics made news but made no tangible contribution to or subtraction from his net worth. Tesla is leading in global electric cars, while SpaceX is working towards making rocket technology reusable. Musk's projects also cover energy storage, AI, and neural tech, providing him with multiple income streams. Musk's increases in net worth despite controversies, disagreements with authorities, or unpleasant encounters with influential persons in social media like Twitter make him the richest person in planet Earth.Co-founder of Google, Larry Page, has leaped to the second position in the worldwide list. There has been a remarkable increase in his wealth from 133.1 billion to 258.3 billion dollars in one year alone. Though Larry has kept himself away from the limelight, he has been pursuing long-term ventures such as the “moonshot” projects of Alphabet, which comprises self-driving automobiles and AI-based health care. Though he is no longer actively involved with Google, his impact on the company’s planning has ensured an increase in his wealth. He is the epitome of success for innovators who firmly believe that innovations related to the tech infrastructure of data enterprises will result in massive returns.Oracle founder Larry Ellison, who holds 98% ownership of Lāna‘i in Hawaii, has moved up to the third position for 2026. This follows his net worth rising from $199.5 billion. He has also served as a technology advisor for Artificial Intelligence policy and strategy with expertise gleaned from his years at Oracle. He has diversified his portfolio, including involvement with ‘real estate, sailing, and life sciences. Ellison has demonstrated his capacity to engage with entrepreneurship and diversify his reach globally, keeping him relevant as one of the most significant stakeholders among the wealthy across the world.Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has slipped to the fourth position, down from $248.1 billion last year. Bezos is a visibly successful person due to his dominance in online e-commerce, cloud computing through AWS, and media ventures like Prime Video. Bezos has had enormous success due to decades of expansion, acquisitions, and reach, but he still invests in space technology through Blue Origin, along with philanthropic work in climate change and healthcare.Sergey Brin, Google co-founder, is at number five with a net worth of $238.4 billion. The position is an improvement from last year, when he ranked fifth with a net worth of $155.4 billion. Sergey Brin's net worth has been strengthened by Alphabet’s success in AI, cloud computing technology, and autonomous driving technology. Sergey Brin is still engaged in innovation and is a major beneficiary of Alphabet's long-term initiatives.Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has also minutely slid out from the top five richest people, with a wealth ranking of $223 billion from the previous year’s assessment of $219.9 billion. Mark Zuckerberg keeps pushing the initiatives for the “metaverse,” AI, and social networking. Zuckerberg’s presence in shaping technology policies and trends around the world has not changed, even though there are certain fluctuations.France's luxury leader, Bernard Arnault, has fallen to the sixth spot from the first position in 2024, but the value of his net worth, which is sourced from the success of LVMH as well as brands such as Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Sephora, is still a remarkable $192.4 billion, slightly lower from the previous year's $195.1 billion, thus symbolizing the timeless use value of exclusive luxury products.A Taiwanese national, Nvidia's co-founder, Jensen Huang, has experienced tremendous growth because of the AI and silicon revolution. His net worth increased from 128.4 billion to 163.9 billion dollars. Huang's vision to develop chips for the gaming, AI, and data center markets has made him one of the leading tech billionaires globally.The 95-year-old investment guru and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway has an estimated net worth of $146.8 billion, a marginal improvement from $143.4 billion. The key to Mr. Buffett’s achievement is his long period of value investing and his knack for investing in businesses during favorable times and diversifying his investment portfolios across various sectors.Amancio Ortega, the Spanish fashion tycoon behind Zara, is still a giant in the industry with an estimated wealth of 145 billion dollars. His success in the fast-fashion industry has been fueled by expansion and supply chain management. Amancio Ortega proves that the success in the affordable fashion industry translates to the accumulation of unimaginable wealth.","Elon musk, tesla, spacex, and x’s ceo, sustains his dominance in the list of global billionaires.

Clavicular calls out alleged PR pitch from Candace Owens ’ manager after podcast appearance





A viral video that is spreading across social media has sparked a heated argument on authenticity, influence and the business of public image. In a digital age where unedited personas tend to establish the largest following, the concept of refining the voice of someone can be a misstep with the establishment of creators in the first place.That tension came into focus after online personality Clavicular shared an unexpected behind-the-scenes encounter. His account quickly gained traction, not because of spectacle, but because it tapped into a growing frustration among creators who believe raw honesty matters more than curated talking points.Clavicular revealed that the encounter happened after an appearance on the Fresh and Fit podcast, where he says he was approached privately by someone claiming to represent Candace Owens. According to Clavicular, the pitch was blunt and expensive, and it completely missed the point of why his audience follows him.Here is his full statement, shared without alteration: “All right, so anyway, I went on Fresh and Fit and there was some guy there lurking in the shadows. He's like, comes up to me, he's like, yo, I'm Candace Owens' manager. He's like, you need PR. And I'm like, wait, what? You want me to have a PR trainer? A handler, essentially, is what they're trying to get me to do.And I'm like, I literally blew up for doing the most anti-PR shit. Like, why would he think that's a good idea? Bro, 100%. And he charged me 30K a month.”The comment struck a nerve because it reflects a wider shift in media power. Independent creators are no longer chasing approval from traditional gatekeepers. Many see PR training as a filter that dulls their edge and distances them from their audience.The alleged $30,000 monthly fee only intensified the backlash. For critics, it symbolized an industry that monetizes control rather than creativity. Supporters of PR argue it protects careers. Detractors see it as reputation management disguised as guidance.Clavicular’s story has now become part of a larger conversation about who really benefits from media polish. In a space built on direct connection, the demand for handlers may be losing its grip.Also Read: Clavicular rejects MrBeast’s 10% offer, refuses to “go PR” and fake his personality for fame",Clavicular claims he was approached after appearing on fresh and fit by someone identifying himself as candace owens’ manager.

Darren “IShowSpeed” and Lyshanda Moyas moment during Zimbabwe livestream sparks debate





Darren “IShowSpeed” found himself in the middle of an online debate after his Zimbabwe livestream went viral. The popular YouTube streamer was visiting the country as part of his Africa tour when viewers noticed a short moment near the end of his stream. During that moment, Miss Universe Zimbabwe 2025 Lyshanda Moyas was seen sitting next to him at a club. Many people online felt that IShowSpeed ignored her, and the clip quickly spread across social media.The livestream took place on January 8, 2026, and ran for a little over five hours. It later crossed three million views. The issue started when users on X pointed out that Lyshanda Moyas appeared briefly but did not interact with the streamer. Some blamed IShowSpeed, while others felt the situation was handled poorly by Moyas’s team.Lyshanda Moyas appeared around the 5:00:04 timestamp of IShowSpeed’s stream. The setting was a club or party scene. She was wearing a red jersey and sat beside him for about five minutes. During that time, there was no clear conversation or introduction on camera. Many viewers felt IShowSpeed did not notice who she was.One X user, @freddyMM93, wrote in full:“Lyshanda our Queen, not everyone knows you. On occasions like these, put on your sash & crown and make it easy for guests to identify you.Speed ‘snubbed’ you cause he saw you in club & perhaps thought you were one of those. Dont take it to heart, fix that next time.”Another user, @MikelaWacho, shared a similar view and said:“Yes, iShowSpeed ignored Lyshanda, Miss Universe Zimbabwe, but honestly she could have handled it better. Her brand is massive and should never be left to chance. This is where management matters. Instead, she was positioned like one of those random club chicks waiting for Speed to buy her a drink, which for someone of her calibre was misguided.”Others felt Moyas should have spoken up. @kayzywizzzy said:“She just stood there, what was she expecting? he definitely doesn’t know her.”Another comment from @Optimus_Dracula added:“He clearly didnt know her and she couldn’t even introduce herself to his team or him being she was in front of him.”Later, entertainment account @richo reported that IShowSpeed only realized who Moyas was after the stream ended. The post also claimed she shared her feelings on Instagram. According to the report, she was upset at first but still thankful for his visit. The post read:“iShowSpeed realises after his Zimbabwe stream ends that he accidentally ignored Miss Universe Zimbabwe 2025, who had come out to greet him. She later posted on Instagram saying she was upset at first, but still happy to see him exploring and celebrating her beautiful country.”The same report also showed a clip of IShowSpeed walking past Moyas earlier during a go-karting visit, adding more context to the situation.Also Read: IShowSpeed says “never again” after weight loss drink sends him running to washroom during South Africa livestream","Youtube streamer ishowspeed was visiting zimbabwe as part of his africa tour.
