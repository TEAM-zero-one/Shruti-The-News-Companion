The digital age has brought about laptops and smartphones, as a reason for which there is a great decline in handwriting. A practice that was once considered an inseparable part of life, is now more often ignored in preference for typing and digital communication. As a result , beautiful handwriting has become a rarity.It's a change with implications for education and personal expression, because there is a very intimate relationship between thoughts and words when one hand writes the former and the latter. Despite this change of trends, there are people who are living examples of the beauty of penmanship .Handwriting is essential to the process of beautifying life through education. Students who write well not only advance academically but also receive praise from teachers who view it as a talent. Consistent practice is essential for mastery of any task, including handwriting.Prakriti Malla of Nepal is an individual whose distinctive handwriting has amazed people all over the world. Her beautiful handwriting is often regarded as the ""world's most beautiful handwriting""..‚Äù Prakriti gained considerable popularity at the age of 16 when she was in the eighth grade.

However, experts in handwriting worldwide have been left stunned by the penmanship of Prakriti. Netizens have many times commented that her handwriting on paper is so good that it seems to be typed on a computer.Prakriti's talent extends beyond mere aesthetics. She wrote a congratulatory letter to the leadership and citizens of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) on the occasion of the 51st Spirit of the Union. She personally handed over the letter to the embassy. Additionally, Prakriti was honored by the Nepalese armed forces for her remarkable penmanship.The story of Prakriti Malla is an example about how important handwriting is to living in an increasingly digital world. She inspires others to appreciate this timeless beauty and significance in the art of putting pen to paper. As we go ahead into this digital age, let us not forget the value in putting pen to paper and the direct connection that is built between our thoughts and our words.Improving handwriting involves consistent practice and attention to detail. Start by choosing the right pen or pencil that you find comfortable. Practice writing slowly and focus on forming each letter correctly. Use lined paper to maintain uniformity in size and spacing of letters.Regularly practice with exercises like writing the alphabet and short sentences. Pay attention to the grip of your writing instrument and maintain proper posture. Gradually increase your writing speed while maintaining neatness. Finally, review your work, identify areas for improvement, and keep practicing consistently to see noticeable progress.Prakriti Malla‚Äôs story reminds us of the timeless beauty and importance of handwriting , even in a digital world.

"""Just turn the page"": Gleyber Torres calls out Yankees for shocking update on facial hair policy",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/just-turn-the-page-gleyber-torres-calls-out-yankees-for-shocking-update-on-facial-hair-policy/articleshow/118461303.cms,"Image via: AP

Gleyber Torres Ditches the Yankees for Beard: Team Finally Lets Players ‚ÄòGrow‚Äô Up!



üö® BREAKING üö® Yankees trim tradition, allow facial hair after 49 years üíà | Get Up

Yankees Remove the Facial Hair Policy INSTANT REACTION | 1172

Well, Gleyber Torres has officially left the Bronx for Motor City, trading in his Yankees pinstripes for a shiny new Tigers uniform. But while his exit may have caused some tears among the fans, perhaps the real news is in his beard ‚Äî and the loser, finally, with the new management ‚Äî Yankees policy on facial hair.Torres apparently signed a one-year $15 million contract with the Detroit Tigers and was one of the first to announce the Yankees' sudden and shockingly open-minded move regarding their long-held famous hair policy. GM Brian Cashman having his opinions on positional changes, Torres just stood there, shrugged his shoulders, and had that magnificent ""I'm not mad, just disappointed"" look. ""To be honest, I don't know what's going on over there,"" he said, dissolving any chance of lingering animosity. ""I was believing everything was good, but I think not. I don't want to give any comments, just turn the page. Whatever they have, they have.""And here comes the funny part: as soon as Torres posted a fresh picture of himself with a luscious beard ‚Äî his personal ""team spirit"" ‚Äî in the most shocking of coups, the Yankees announced they were reversing their infamous facial hair policy. Beard rules, baby!In case you have been living under a rock (or maybe, a clean-shaven rock), for quite some time now, Yankees' rules have long been relegated to legend: no facial hair below the upper lip. Mustache? Sure. Any resemblance to a full beard? Not a chance. Well, now? It's 2025, and there are winds of change...or rather, beard style.On Friday, Yankees owner Hal Steinbrenner dispensed some wisdom about the matter ""allow well-groomed beards."" Yes, you read it right. Not a stray hair from the chin, not even two days of growth ‚Äî they are talking about a well-groomed beard.""I've spoken to a large number of former and current Yankees... and ultimately, the decision rests with me,"" Steinbrenner said. ""We have decided to allow well-groomed beards moving forward. It is appropriate to break from the familiar comfort of our former policy.""So, as Gleyber Torres ventures into a new era in Detroit with his new beard, it looks like the Yankees are becoming accustomed to letting some hair down. Perhaps, Torres wasn't just moving on from the team ‚Äî he was helping them 'turn the page' in every way possible. Cheers to a bearded future for the Bronx Bombers... who'd have known?","Gleyber torres signed a one-year $15 million contract with the detroit tigers.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has some advice for new Microsoft employees. Nadella emphasised the importance of viewing the company as a platform for both economic growth and personal fulfillment.While sharing his perspective during a recent podcast with Indian YouTuber Dwarkesh Patel, he described this as a ‚Äúcontract‚Äù where employees benefit not only financially but also by achieving a sense of purpose and mission.‚ÄúEven for anybody joining Microsoft‚Ä¶ as long as they feel that they can use this as a platform for their both economic return, but also a sense of purpose and a sense of mission that they can accomplish, by using us as a platform. So, therefore, that's the contract,‚Äù he said.Replying to a question on what he is doing to retain the future Satya Nadellas, the CEO said ‚Äúthe way to think about it is, longevity is not a goal; relevance is.‚Äù‚ÄúThe thing that I have to do and all 200,000 of us have to do every day is: Are we doing things that are useful and relevant for the world as we see it evolving, not just today, but tomorrow?,‚Äù he said.Nadella also touched upon the ideal employee-employer relationship and what it means to be a ‚Äúcompany person‚Äù. He stressed the importance of fostering a work culture that allows employees to become integral to the company, highlighting Microsoft's success in cultivating such an environment.‚ÄúSo I think companies have to create a culture that allows people to come in and become company people like me. And Microsoft got it more right than wrong, at least in my case. I hope that remains the case,‚Äù Nadella stated.Reflecting on his own 34-year tenure at Microsoft, Nadella expressed his enduring enthusiasm for the company.‚ÄúThrough my 34 years now of Microsoft, it has basically been, each year, I felt more excited about being at Microsoft versus thinking that 'I'm a company person',‚Äù he explained.Nadella also discussed topics such as artificial general intelligence (AGI) and quantum computing breakthroughs during the podcast interview.",Nadella on his 34 years at microsoft: 'longevity is not a goal; relevance is' he stressed the importance of fostering a work culture that allows employees to become integral to the company.

How people are exposing themselves to scams

Signs of a romance scam

Asking for money or gifts (64%)



Using urgent or emotional language (49%)



Avoiding video calls or in-person meetings (41%)



Telling a sob story to gain sympathy (31%)



Giving inconsistent answers (24%)



Evading personal questions (20%)



Making grand promises or boasting excessively (12%)



Asking overly personal questions (11%)



UK mobile network operator EE has issued an urgent warning about the dangers of sharing personal details online, particularly when dating. The mobile network provider found that many users are giving away sensitive information too easily, putting themselves at risk of scams and impersonation fraud.According to EE‚Äôs survey of 2,000 UK phone users, an alarming 93% admitted to sharing personal details over text, messaging apps, or social media. A significant number do so while chatting with new acquaintances or online dating. With Valentine's Day heightening social interactions, EE is urging people to remain cautious.""Online dating has opened exciting new options for singles, but also a novel channel for criminals hunting for new ways to defraud their victims,"" EE stated.Research shows that one in ten (11%) people currently dating have been targeted by romance scams . Even more concerning, one in five victims lost an average of ¬£2,500 due to these fraudulent schemes.According to The Mirror, EE‚Äôs findings revealed that 65% of users shared their phone number, 51% disclosed their location and 35% provided access to their social media profile.Additionally, 345 respondents said they had noticed suspicious behaviour from someone they were messaging, while 15% had been directly asked for money.The main danger lies in trusting people who may not be who they claim to be. Fraudsters can use personal information to impersonate victims, potentially leading to identity theft and financial loss.Even non-EE customers should stay alert. Last year, during the Valentine‚Äôs period, EE recorded a sharp rise in scam texts. In February 2024 alone, the company blocked 12 million malicious messages‚Äîwell above the usual monthly average of 8.9 million. The network expects similar activity this year.""Scammers are experts at preying on the vulnerable,"" warns Richard Wainer, EE‚Äôs regulatory affairs director. ""At this time of year, when social media is full of public displays of affection, it can be tempting to turn a blind eye to the red flags, but spotting them is more important than ever"", Wainer added.To help users stay safe, EE has identified key red flags to watch out for when chatting online:EE urges users to remain cautious when communicating with people they don‚Äôt know well, especially when emotions are involved. Scammers often take advantage of trust and vulnerability, making it crucial to recognise the warning signs before it‚Äôs too late.","Uk mobile network operator ee has issued an urgent warning about the dangers of sharing personal details online, particularly when dating.

Potential

spillover risk

Monitoring and

pandemic preparedness

A new bat coronavirus with the potential for animal-to-human transmission has been discovered by a team of Chinese researchers, raising concerns about possible future spillover events. The virus, named HKU5-CoV-2 , was found to use the same human receptor as SARS-CoV-2 , the virus responsible for Covid-19.According to the South China Morning Post, the study was led by Shi Zhengli , a renowned virologist known as ""batwoman"" due to her extensive research on bat coronaviruses.The research involved scientists from the Guangzhou Laboratory, Guangzhou Academy of Sciences, Wuhan University, and the Wuhan Institute of Virology . Their findings were published in the peer-reviewed journal Cell on Tuesday.The newly discovered virus belongs to the merbecovirus subgenus, which includes the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus. It is a new lineage of the HKU5 coronavirus, initially identified in Japanese pipistrelle bats in Hong Kong.The research found that HKU5-CoV-2 can bind to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor, the same receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to infect human cells. ""We report the discovery and isolation of a distinct lineage (lineage 2) of HKU5-CoV, which can utilise not only bat ACE2 but also human ACE2 and various mammalian ACE2 orthologs,"" the scientists wrote.The study warned that bat merbecoviruses ""pose a high risk of spillover to humans, either through direct transmission or facilitated by intermediate hosts.""According to the researchers, HKU5-CoV-2 can bind to ACE2 receptors in multiple animal species, increasing the likelihood of interspecies transmission.Despite its potential for human infection, the researchers cautioned against exaggerating the threat. They noted that the virus‚Äôs efficiency in binding to human ACE2 is ‚Äúsignificantly lower‚Äù than that of SARS-CoV-2. ""The risk of [HKU5-CoV-2] emergence in human populations should not be exaggerated,"" they said.Earlier this month, Cell published a study by researchers from the University of Washington in Seattle and Wuhan University, which concluded that while the HKU5 strain could bind to bat and other mammalian ACE2 receptors, it did not show ""efficient"" binding to human ACE2.However, Shi‚Äôs team countered that HKU5-CoV-2 appears to be better adapted to human receptors than its predecessor, lineage 1, and ""may have a broader host range and a higher potential for interspecies infection,"" South China Morning Post reported.Given the potential risks, the researchers focused on the need for further monitoring. The World Health Organization has already included merbecoviruses on its list of emerging pathogens for pandemic preparedness.Shi Zhengli, who played a key role in Covid-19 research, has previously denied claims that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was responsible for the pandemic.While the origins of Covid-19 remain debated, some studies suggest the virus originated in bats and jumped to humans through an intermediate host.","A new bat coronavirus with the potential for animal-to-human transmission has been discovered by a team of chinese researchers.

BEIJING: Chinese technology giant Tencent on Monday said it had started trialling its own artificial intelligence reasoning model after integrating DeepSeek into some of its products, saying the move would make responses ""more 'human'"".Insurgent Chinese AI startup DeepSeek made global headlines last month when it unveiled its R1 chatbot that can seemingly match American competitors at a fraction of the cost.Since then, a series of major Chinese companies have said they will integrate DeepSeek's technology into their products.On Monday, Tencent said in a post on WeChat, the social media platform it owns, that selected users of its Yuanbao chatbot may address queries to either DeepSeek or its homegrown AI reasoning model "" Hunyuan Thinker "".""With the support of two deep reasoning models, the question-answering is more professional, the reasoning is more powerful, and the writing is more 'human',"" Tencent said of the beta testing rollout.Tencent, which also operates the QQ messaging app and is a major player in online gaming, has sought to capture a larger share of the burgeoning AI market in China.The Shenzhen-based company is understood to have started exploring the integration of DeepSeek into multiple products, with some users of the domestic version of WeChat noting the addition of an AI search function on Sunday.A Tencent spokesperson confirmed to AFP that the domestic app, which has over a billion monthly active users, had ""recently started beta testing access to DeepSeek"".The move intensifies competition in China's internet search sector after tech titan Baidu said Sunday it would weave DeepSeek into its market-leading search engine to ""enrich a more diversified search experience"".Last week, Chinese electric-vehicle giant BYD said it would integrate DeepSeek's software into its cars, following other domestic automakers like Geely, Great Wall Motors and Leapmotor.Despite its rise to prominence at home, DeepSeek has drawn scrutiny in some countries over its collection and handling of users' personal data.South Korea became the latest jurisdiction to remove the chatbot from app stores on Monday pending a security review, following similar moves in Italy, Taiwan, Australia and some US states.","Chinese technology giant tencent has started trialling its own artificial intelligence reasoning model.

Takeaways: Tesla has sued Chinese customers and journalists and won almost every time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/takeaways-tesla-has-sued-chinese-customers-and-journalists-and-won-almost-every-time/articleshow/118180992.cms,"In this photo, Zhang Yazhou sits on the roof of her damaged Tesla Model 3 with a bullhorn outside a Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou (Image credits: AP)

Tesla did not return requests for comment. Here are some key things to know about Tesla's success in China:

Media coverage of Tesla in China is constrained

BEIJING: Tesla has embraced an aggressive legal strategy in China to stifle its critics suing its own customers.That's left some Tesla owners desperate. Zhang Yazhou protested publicly that her Model 3's brakes had failed and caused an accident in 2021 that sent her parents to the hospital. Tesla said that wasn't true and sued her for defamation. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay the $1.1-trillion company more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize for her criticism.""I refuse to accept it,"" said Zhang, who appealed the verdict. ""As a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.""As concerns mount about eroding checks and balances in the US, Tesla's record in China shows how it has thrived in a system where regulators, the courts and media all answer to the ruling Communist Party.It's not common for automakers in China or elsewhere to sue their own customers. But Tesla has done so successfully in China, where Elon Musk 's company has used the courts and the patronage of a powerful leader to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.Musk has a powerful patron in China Tesla's commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China's premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping . Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China's financial capital under his watch in 2019.With Li's support, Tesla was the first foreign automaker allowed to retain complete control over its China venture. Tesla got low-interest loans, tax breaks, favorable regulatory changes and other benefits.In January 2020, Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. That year, Tesla turned an annual profit for the first time in its history and Musk was soon declared the world's richest person.Musk's ""greater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,"" said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd, an advisory firm based in Shanghai. ""He's done a good job of it in China, and he's done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.""Requests for comment to the state council, which is run by Li Qiang, went unanswered.Tesla has had an impressive winning streak in Chinese courts Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures.The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review of public court documents and Chinese media reports by The Associated Press.Tesla won all eleven cases for which AP could determine the verdicts. Two judgments are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it has also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgments in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.While some industry experts say it's generally difficult for customers to win such cases, others say it's remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.""For Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,"" said Russo, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. ""The odds are stacked against you. It's like going to the casino and winning every hand.""In a statement to AP, the Shanghai high people's court said that judgements are the result of a ""fair trial.""""It cannot be assumed that the party has received 'special protection' or 'special treatment' because of their victory,"" the court wrote.Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.""We were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,"" a tech reporter told AP.Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk's company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. PingWest had to apologize for a report that claimed Tesla's Shanghai factory was a ""sweatshop"" and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). The AP could not determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com, which drew Tesla's ire after writing about the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla.Electric vehicle giant BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors in going after car owners who suffered crashes.""Tesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,"" said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,000) after he wrote about Tesla's alleged brake failures. ""Tesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.""","Tesla's success in china has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: li qiang, the former party boss of shanghai who is now china's premier.

Reducing errors is the big challenge



Anyone who has sat through a third-grade science class knows there are three primary states of matter: solid, liquid and gas.Microsoft now says it has created a new state of matter in its quest to make a powerful machine, called a quantum computer, that could accelerate the development of everything from batteries to medicines to artificial intelligence.On Wednesday, Microsoft's scientists said they had built what is known as a ""topological qubit"" based on this new phase of physical existence, which could be harnessed to solve mathematical, scientific and technological problems.With the development, Microsoft is raising the stakes in what is set to be the next big technological contest, beyond today's race over artificial intelligence. Scientists have chased the dream of a quantum computer -- a machine that could exploit the strange and exceedingly powerful behavior of subatomic particles or very cold objects -- since the 1980s.The push heated up in December when Google unveiled an experimental quantum computer that needed just five minutes to complete a calculation that most supercomputers could not finish in 10 septillion years -- longer than the age of the known universe.Microsoft's quantum technology could leapfrog the methods under development at Google. As part of its research, the company built multiple topological qubits inside a new kind of computer chip that combines the strengths of the semiconductors that power classical computers with the superconductors that are typically used to build a quantum computer.When such a chip is cooled to extremely low temperatures, it behaves in unusual and powerful ways that Microsoft believes will allow it to solve technological, mathematical and scientific problems that classical machines never could. The technology is not as volatile as other quantum technologies, the company said, making it easier to exploit its power.Some question whether Microsoft has achieved this milestone, and many leading academics said quantum computers would not be fully realized for decades. But Microsoft's scientists said their methods would help them reach the finish line sooner.""We view this as something that is years away, not decades away,"" said Chetan Nayak , a Microsoft technical fellow who led the team that built the technology.Microsoft's technology, which was detailed in a research paper published in the science journal Nature on Wednesday, adds new impetus to a race that could reshape the technological landscape. In addition to accelerating progress across many technological and scientific fields, a quantum computer could be powerful enough to break the encryption that protects national secrets.Any advances are set to have geopolitical implications. Even as the United States explores quantum computing primarily through corporations like Microsoft and a wave of startups, the Chinese government has said it is investing $15.2 billion in the technology. The European Union has committed $7.2 billion.Quantum computing, which builds on decades of research into a type of physics called quantum mechanics, is still an experimental technology. But after recent strides by Microsoft, Google and others, scientists are confident that the technology will eventually live up to its promise.""Quantum computing is a thrilling prospect for physics, and for the world,"" said Frank Wilczek, a theoretical physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.To understand quantum computing, it helps to know how a traditional computer works. A smartphone, laptop or desktop PC relies on tiny chips made from semiconductors, which are materials that conduct electricity in some but not all situations. These chips store and process numbers, adding them, multiplying them and so on. They perform these calculations by manipulating ""bits"" of information. Each bit holds either a 1 or a 0.A quantum computer operates differently. A quantum bit, or qubit, relies on the curious behavior of subatomic particles or exotic materials cooled to extremely low temperatures.When it is either extremely small or extremely cold, a single object can behave like two separate objects at the same time. By harnessing that behavior, scientists can build a qubit that holds a combination of 1 and 0. This means that two qubits can hold four values at once. And as the number of qubits grows, a quantum computer becomes exponentially more powerful.Companies use a variety of techniques to build these machines. In the United States, most, including Google, build qubits using superconductors, which are materials that conduct electricity without losing the energy they are transmitting. They create these superconductors by cooling metals to extremely low temperatures.Microsoft has bet on an approach that few others are taking: combining semiconductors with superconductors. The basic principle -- along with the name topological qubit -- was first proposed in 1997 by Alexei Kitaev, a Russian American physicist.The company began working on this unusual project in the early 2000s, when many researchers did not think such technology was possible. It is Microsoft's longest-running research project.""This is something that all three CEOs of this company have bet on,"" Satya Nadella , Microsoft's CEO, said in an interview. (The company's previous CEOs were Bill Gates, a founder, and Steve Ballmer , who ran Microsoft in the early 2000s.)The company has now created a single device that is part indium arsenide (a type of semiconductor) and part aluminum (a superconductor at low temperatures). When it is cooled to about 400 degrees below zero, it exhibits a kind of otherworldly behavior that might make quantum computers possible.Philip Kim, a physics professor at Harvard University, said Microsoft's new creation was significant because topological qubits could accelerate the development of quantum computers. ""If everything works out, Microsoft's research could be revolutionary,"" he said.But Jason Alicea, a professor of theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology, questioned whether the company had actually built a topological qubit, saying the behavior of quantum systems is often hard to prove.""A topological qubit is possible in principle, and people agree it is a worthwhile goal,"" Alicea said. ""You have to verify, though, that a device behaves in all the magical ways that theory predicts it should; otherwise, the reality may turn out to be less rosy for quantum computing. Fortunately, Microsoft is now set up to try.""","Microsoft says it has created a new state of matter in its quest to make a quantum computer.

The internet erupted in a meme frenzy after Kash Patel was confirmed as the new FBI Director by the US Senate. While political circles debated his appointment, social media had its own way of celebrating‚Äîthrough viral memes. The standout moment? Donald Trump‚Äôs former aide, Dan Scavino , shared a Bollywood meme featuring Patel in a grand warrior-style entrance, sparking a flood of reactions online.Scavino, known for his social media prowess, took to X (formerly Twitter) to post an edited clip from the Bollywood blockbuster Bajirao Mastani. The original scene features actor Ranveer Singh as the fearless Maratha warrior Bajirao, dancing to the triumphant song Malhari after a victorious battle. However, in this new version, Singh‚Äôs face was replaced with Patel‚Äôs, symbolizing his dramatic entry into the FBI‚Äôs top position.The meme quickly went viral, with users across the political spectrum reacting in amusement, disbelief, and curiosity. Some found it hilarious, others questioned if Americans even understood the Bollywood reference, while many simply enjoyed the unexpected crossover.As the meme circulated, social media users had a field day with their own interpretations:""Kash Patel walking into the FBI office on Day 1 like a Bollywood hero‚Äîthis is GOLD!"" one user wrote.""Malhari means ‚Äòcelebration after victory‚Äô... this meme is actually spot on!"" another pointed out.""I love this meme so much, and I‚Äôve had such a hard time finding a good-quality version of it.

Saving for later.""""Americans using Bollywood memes without knowing the context is my favorite genre of the internet.""""If Patel actually entered his office with this song playing, I‚Äôd pay to see that!""Some users even created their own versions of the meme, adding sound effects and captions like ""Patel cleaning house at the FBI like..."" while using Bollywood action scenes.While the internet was busy with memes, Patel took to X with a serious message about his new role. In his first public statement as FBI Director, he emphasized his commitment to restoring public trust in the agency.‚ÄúI am honored to serve as the ninth Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The American people deserve an agency that operates with integrity and fairness. Alongside the hardworking men and women of the FBI, we will restore the agency‚Äôs reputation. And to those who seek to harm Americans‚Äîtake this as a warning. We will find you, no matter where you hide. Mission First. America Always. Now, let‚Äôs get to work.‚ÄùHis no-nonsense message signaled a tough stance on national security and law enforcement. However, online users couldn‚Äôt help but wonder: would Patel secretly enjoy the Bollywood meme that had turned him into an internet sensation?The use of memes in political discourse has been on the rise, and this incident proves just how powerful they can be. Patel‚Äôs appointment itself is a significant moment‚Äîan Indian-American leading the FBI under a Trump administration, a move that has drawn both praise and criticism.

Rather than being served by it

Hunger and obesity, bumper crops and environmental damage are simultaneous facts of our food system.This incredibly complex global network is hard to describe.How the World Eats: A Global Food Philosophy by Julian Baggini is a panoramic overview of traditional societies, the industrialised world and those in-between. It explores all the debates from the ideal diet to agri systems to global food companies, but shuns binary solutions or single prescriptions.Take the idea of the optimal meal, with large servings of fruit, vegetable and grain. The Maasai in east Africa eat milk, meat and blood, the Inuit eat barely any plant. Yet, transitioning away from these diets has harmed their health outcomes. Instead of going by findings of nutritional science , it may make sense to trust the enduring traditional diets .Meanwhile, while the sustainable foraging lifestyle of the Hadza in Tanzania is the kind romanticised in the paleo diet, they have been known to happily eat other food if it was an option. Humans can eat novel foods and thrive.The book takes on the idea that food can be broken down into nutritional components and engineered for the perfect mix. This mainly works for manufacturers who label their goods and claim to serve public health. In fact, we know little about the chemicals in food (there are 2,306 distinct components in a clove of garlic), let alone their effects on health.Red meat is not inherently bad for you, it depends on what it is eaten with. Celebration of omega-3 fatty acids and damnation of omega-6s was similarly reductive. While there might be a link between some deficiencies and illnesses like scurvy, the link between nutritional excesses and lacks with chronic illnesses is a high jump, not warranted by the evidence.This also goes for the bogey around industrial, or ultra-processed food. Not all of it is equally bad, even if whole food is better for you. It also complicates questions around farming. Tiny Netherlands is one of the world‚Äôs biggest agri exporters, because of its intensive farming with synthetic inputs. While organic, regenerative and no-till farming is often talked up as the ideal answer, different conditions demand different solutions, and the principle is to do no more than what the land can tolerate.The book shows how global food corporations and their shareholders came to be at the centre of the food regime, through the 1980s and 90s and the formation of WTO. Only determined regulation can fix these harms. Food workers are exploited as landowners and traders profit. The answer is to ensure poor people have enough money to eat well, rather than keep them dependent on cheap and unhealthy food.It also explores the historical inequalities behind commodity crops like Belgian chocolate or Italian coffee, where intermediaries and manufacturers profit while countries in Africa provide the beans and labour, and a single chocolate bar costs more than a cacao farmer‚Äôs earnings.On many other contentious topics, from the meat industry to GM crops, the book advises empiricism over purity, while also showing the organised interests behind a particular recommendation. Food should be at the centre of the food world, not commodification or corporate profits. Compassion and equitability are clearly essential, and that can only happen through democratic accountability when we act like ‚Äòfood citizens‚Äô rather than passive consumers.","How the world eats: a global food philosophy by julian baggini is a panoramic overview of traditional societies, the industrialised world and those in-between.

"UPI users take note! Google Pay follows other PhonePe and Paytm, to introduce convenience fee for these transactions",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/upi-users-take-note-google-pay-introduces-convenience-fee-for-these-transactions/articleshow/118407751.cms,"Introduction of platform fees for bill payments by Google Pay indicates a wider movement towards monetising UPI transactions.

Google Pay, a prominent UPI ( Unified Payments Interface ) platform, has begun implementing a convenience fee for utility bill payments , including electricity and cooking gas bills. Previously free for low-value transactions, the service now charges between 0.5% and 1% plus GST for payments made using credit and debit cards. With this, Google Pay now follows some other UPI apps like PhonePe and Paytm that charge similar fee.This development follows the platform's previous implementation of a Rs 3 convenience fee for mobile recharges implemented over a year ago.A review by ET revealed that a customer paid approximately Rs 15 as ""convenience fee"" whilst settling an electricity bill with a credit card. The charge, which included GST, was also described as a ""processing fee for debit and credit card transactions"".An industry insider explained to the financial daily that the introduction of platform fees for bill payments by Google Pay indicates a wider movement towards monetising UPI transactions , as service providers aim to recover payment processing costs. The source added that fintech firms are striving to achieve a balance between expansion and sustainable revenue as UPI usage increases.Also Read | Tesla India entry: Why Donald Trump has said it would be ‚Äòvery unfair‚Äô for Elon Musk‚Äôs Tesla to set up a factory in India Google Pay maintains a significant market presence, handling approximately 37% of UPI transactions, ranking second to Walmart-supported PhonePe. The platform processed UPI transactions worth Rs 8.26 lakh crore as of January.According to an informed source, charging convenience or platform fees is standard practice in the industry. The source indicated that while Google Pay previously covered this expense, it has now opted to transfer the cost to users.Google Pay's website indicates that while convenience fees apply to card payments, UPI transactions linked directly to bank accounts remain fee-free. The timing of when these charges were introduced remains unclear.For specific bill payments including water, piped gas and electricity, PhonePe implements convenience fees on card transactions, as stated on their website. Similarly, Paytm levies platform fees between Rs 1 to Rs 40 for UPI recharges and various utility bill payments, including gas, water and credit card settlements.UPI's widespread adoption hasn't translated into substantial revenue for fintech firms. PwC's study reveals that processing UPI person-to-merchant transactions costs stakeholders approximately 0.25% of transaction value. During FY24, UPI transaction processing expenses reached Rs 12,000 crore, with Rs 4,000 crore spent on transactions under Rs 2,000.Also Read | What‚Äôs in a name?

The Indian government's policy since 2020 has waived MDR for UPI transactions below Rs 2,000 to boost digital payments. From 2021, the government began covering MDR costs for these smaller transactions. Transactions exceeding Rs 2,000 permit a 1.1% merchant fee.""The Indian government has played a crucial role in ensuring UPI's growth, covering the costs associated with low-value transactions to encourage adoption,"" an industry executive said. ""However, the absence of MDR for smaller transactions has left UPI platforms with limited avenues to generate revenue directly from users.""UPI's growth trajectory remains strong, with January 2025 recording 16.99 billion transactions worth Rs 23.48 lakh crore. This shows a 1.55% volume increase and 1% transaction value growth from December 2024, whilst demonstrating 39% year-on-year growth.","Google pay, a prominent upi ( unified payments interface ) platform, has begun implementing a convenience fee for utility bill payments.
