On track to develop locally-made marine engine for Navy by 2028: Kirloskar co CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/on-track-to-develop-locally-made-marine-engine-for-navy-by-2028-kirloskar-co-ceo/articleshow/128796662.cms,"NEW DELHI: Kirloskar Oil Engines, one of the flagship companies of India’s Kirloskar group, has said that the company is “on track” to deliver India's first locally-made marine engine for the Indian Navy.A four-stroke, 6 MW V12 engine will be “delivered to the Navy by April 2028”as per contractually-mandated deadline, Kirloskar Oil Engines' CEO Rahul Sahai recently told the media.A sanction order for the design and development of a 6 MW medium speed marine diesel engine was signed between the Navy and the Kirloskar last April under Make-I category of the procurement procedure. Prototype diesel engine with indigenous content of over 50% is being developed at a cost of Rs 270 crore with 70% funding from the govt.These engines are intended for main propulsion and power generation on Navy and Coast Guard vessels.The Navy has contracted the development of this engine in order to achieve ‘Aatmanirbharta’ (self-reliance) in marine engine manufacturing. The engine development will reduce reliance on foreign original equipment manufacturers from countries like the US, UK, and Ukraine as the critical technology will be available in-house and save foreign exchange.The initiative strengthens indigenous capabilities, supports the “Make in India” initiative, and fosters a domestic defence industrial ecosystem.The development of the engine supports the conversion of older steam-based systems to modern, efficient diesel-based systems, as seen in the upgrade of the INS Beas. Developing indigenous engines will also allow better control over life cycle costs, maintenance, and supply chains for the Navy.","A four-stroke, 6 mw v12 engine will be “delivered to the navy by april 2028” the navy has contracted the development of this engine in order to achieve ‘aatmanirbharta’ (self-reliance) in marine engine manufacturing.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128796712,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-75426,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: It begins innocently. One short video while waiting for a cab. Another before dinner. A few more before sleeping. Somewhere between swipe and scroll, 40 minutes pass.Short-form videos are everywhere - on Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts and similar platforms. But a global review of nearly 98,000 people, published in Psychological Bulletin, suggests that heavy, compulsive use may be affecting how we focus and how we feel.The analysis combined 71 studies across countries and age groups, including teenagers and adults, with the average participant in their early twenties.It does not claim that short videos cause permanent harm. But it finds consistent links between heavier scrolling and weaker attention, poorer impulse control and higher stress and anxiety.In simple terms, the more compulsive the scrolling, the harder it may be to concentrate on slower tasks - reading, studying or finishing work without checking the phone. Researchers suggest when every swipe delivers something new, the brain begins to expect constant stimulation. When that pace slows, boredom may set in faster.Clinicians say the design of these platforms plays a role. Short bursts of novelty, colour and instant reward repeatedly activate the brain's reward pathway, reinforcing the urge to keep watching.Most people can step away with conscious effort, but those predisposed to addictive or obsessive traits may find it harder to disengage, says Dr Paramjeet Singh, consultant psychiatrist at PSRI Hospital, who notes that excessive scrolling is increasingly showing up in clinics as fatigue, reduced focus and even strain in relationships.From a psychological standpoint, the concern is not dramatic harm but gradual shifts in how the brain responds to stimulation. Dr Jyoti Mishra, senior consultant - Psychology at Apollo Spectra Hospital, Delhi, says short-form videos are engineered around novelty and instant gratification. Compulsive watching can slowly erode attention span and impulse control. Prolonged exposure to fast, emotionally charged content keeps neural networks in a heightened state of alert, she explains, which may manifest as restlessness, poor concentration and anxiety, particularly in young adults.The good news, she adds, is that practising digital hygiene - limiting screen time, taking breaks and protecting sleep - can reverse many of these effects.The review found that addictive or hard-to-control use had stronger links with these effects than total screen time alone.Importantly, the research shows association, not proof of cause. People already struggling with attention or anxiety may be more drawn to fast-paced content.Still, when dozens of studies point in the same direction, the pattern deserves attention. The scroll is effortless. Sustained attention takes work. And that balance may be worth preserving.","Global review of nearly 98,000 people suggests that heavy, compulsive use may be affecting how we focus and how we feel.

Nearly 50 officials were to be deployed to attend to Banzal and a chief general manager.Following uproar, the telecom service officer called off the trip, which also included visits to temples and some meetings.According to the BSNL website, Banzal's ""never say rest"" attitude and constant innovation have helped drive growth in the fixed-line business. Since 2016, he has been promoting and managing Bharat Fiber, BSNL IT framework and other services.

Kayla Nicole Linked to Diddy’s ""Villain Lair"" as Travis Kelce Moves On



In the age of the ""stan"" wars, the line between celebrity gossip and a digital witch hunt has become increasingly thin. This week, as the world celebrates Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift’s romantic Olympic watch parties, the internet’s focus has taken a sharp, darker turn toward Kelce’s ex-girlfriend, Kayla Nicole. While Travis and Taylor are enjoying their ""Golden Era,"" Kayla has found herself in the crosshairs of Lipstick Alley (LSA) investigators, who are digging through her past social calendar with a fine-tooth comb.The latest wave of ""tea"" involves unverified claims that Kayla was a ""frequent flyer"" at the infamous parties hosted by Sean ""Diddy"" Combs. In what has become a viral thread on LSA, users are attempting to link the sports journalist and influencer to Diddy’s inner circle, citing her years as a prominent socialite during the height of the ""Bad Boy"" era.The terminology being used describing Diddy’s residences as a ""villain lair"" and Kayla as a regular attendee is part of a broader trend of ""guilt by association"" currently sweeping social media. With Diddy’s 2025 trial resulting in significant legal fallout, the internet has become obsessed with unmasking every celebrity who ever stepped foot in his vicinity.For Kayla Nicole, the timing of these resurfaced rumors feels particularly pointed.Just last week, Kayla sparked outrage among ""Swifties"" for a Super Bowl commercial that seemingly shaded her ex’s high-profile relationship. Since then, the digital retaliation has been swift. ""Lipstick Alley investigators"" have begun posting ""testimonies"" and old tagged photos, attempting to paint her as a regular in a social circle that has since been disgraced.It is important to understand that these proofs are entirely unauthorized. While Kayla was a regular attendee at high-end events and industry parties for years, there is no evidence or legal testimony linking her to the illegal activities that have been the focus of the Diddy federal case. However, in the court of public opinion, especially on forums like LSA, the ""tea"" often matters more than the truth.This whole hunt highlights the toxic side of the internet, when a celebrity moves on, the ""ex"" is often subjected to criticism, or in this case, ""guilty"" social connections.As of February 25, 2026, Kayla Nicole has not responded to the forum threads or the ""frequent flyer"" allegations. For now, the ""investigation"" continues to prove that in the digital age, your past guest lists can be used against you long after the party is over.","Kayla nicole linked to diddy's ""villain lair"" as travis kelce moves on with taylor swift.

"John Cena vs Roman Reigns net worth comparison: Current salaries, WWE earnings, and Hollywood income breakdown",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/wwe/top-stories/john-cena-vs-roman-reigns-net-worth-comparison-current-salaries-wwe-earnings-and-hollywood-income-breakdown/articleshow/128789028.cms,"John Cena vs Roman Reigns (Image Source: WWE)

John Cena’s Hollywood expansion fuels his massive net worth

Roman Reigns’ WWE dominance drives steady multi-million earnings

John Cena and Roman Reigns are two of the biggest names in modern professional wrestling, but their financial journeys have taken markedly different career paths. Cena is a 16-time world champion, but successfully pivoted to mainstream entertainment and carved out an international brand well beyond the scope of WWE. Reigns, whose stranglehold on WWE’s modern era as its dominant force and long-term “Tribal Chief” has been largely about wrestling, is the company’s marquee attraction.Both superstars pocket multi-million dollar advances, but their earnings streams show a marked difference. Cena’s wealth is derived from Hollywood blockbusters, television shows and endorsements. On the other hand, Reigns’s overall wealth is mostly gathered from WWE contracts, merchandise royalties, and select sponsorships.As of February 2026, the estimated net worth of John Cena is close to around $80 million. A lot of that wealth was accrued during his prime WWE era, when he is said to have grossed $10 million-$12 million per year based on his base salary and pay-per-view bonuses as well as a generous percentage of merchandise for sale.Cena remains on WWE's books, with his income continuing through special appearances and merchandise revenue.But the game changer has been Hollywood. Cena secured starring roles in colossal film franchises such as Fast & Furious and headlined the DC series Peacemaker, both of which earned him multi-million dollar per project paydays. On the acting side, he has hosted television shows, appeared in commercials and signed endorsement deals with worldwide brands. Through these ventures, he has diversified his income sources and made the kind of money you can make far away from the wrestling racket. His cross-industry appeal has made him one of the richest alumni in WWE history.Roman Reigns, a.k.a. Leati Joseph Anoaʻi, in 2026, has an estimated net worth of between $14 million and $20 million. Reigns’ wealth comes primarily from wrestling, unlike Cena. He is one of the highest-billed superstars in WWE, earning just over $5 million a year under his contract alone, before bonuses and merchandise royalties.Reigns has been positioned as WWE’s premier attraction for years, headlining premium live events and dominating merchandise sales charts. His income also includes performance bonuses, appearance fees and a few endorsement partnerships. While he has made cameo appearances in Hollywood projects, he hasn’t pursued acting as aggressively as Cena.The comparison ultimately reveals two successful but divergent financial blueprints. Cena parlayed WWE stardom into regular riches in mainstream entertainment, and Reigns has fully taken advantage of his status as the company’s face. Both are still financial titans, but Cena’s diversified empire has placed him well ahead in overall net worth.","John cena and roman reigns are two of the biggest names in modern professional wrestling.

""I would think about tasks that are human-centred, tasks that involve relating to people. I think the stuff like code and software engineering is becoming more and more kind of AI-focused, like things like maths and science.”

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei’s advice to 25-year-olds who are trying to choose a profession



“Anything where you're building on AI, and if AI is the tailwind, you can be part of some other part of the supply chain, something in the semiconductor space, which, I think, is – that's one example. It has an element of the physical world and more traditional engineering, not software engineering. Again, the very kind of human-centred professions.

That is something I would think about. And I think the other thing I always say is that, in a world where AI can kind of generate or create anything, having basic critical thinking skills may be the most important thing for success.

I worry about these AI models that generate images and videos. And we don't make models that generate images and videos for many reasons, but this is one of them. It's really hard to tell what's real from what's not.

So, a significant part of success may be having the street smarts not to get fooled by... I mean, hopefully, we can crack down on and regulate some of this fake content.

But assume we can't; critical thinking skills will be really important, and you don't want to fall for fake things. You don't want to have false beliefs. You don't want to get scammed. That's really advice that I would give to someone.”

Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei has advised students and younger professionals to pivot toward human-centred skills. Speaking at a recent episode of Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath's WTF podcast, the co-founder of the artificial intelligence (AI) company that is behind the Claude chatbot that wiped billions from software, cybersecurity and other stocks has asked students and younger professionals to steer clear of software engineering and math-heavy fields that are rapidly being taken over by machines.Amodei advised that those mapping out their careers should focus onas coding and technical disciplines become increasingly AI-dominated. This comes after he warned last year that AI would eliminate half of all white-collar jobs within the next five years.When asked about the industries that AI will disrupt and what skills college goers and upcoming entrepreneurs should learn, Amodei said,For 25-year-olds who are trying to choose a profession, Amodei said,","Anthropic ceo dario amodei has advised students and younger professionals to pivot toward human-centred skills.

'India Well Positioned To Lead The World In AI': OpenAI CEO Sam Altman At AI Impact Summit

San Francisco entrepreneur startup Ryze big drop after Claude

What is the plan for the future

Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.6 : New updated AI feature

Quick tip: You can’t control the pace of AI development. You can only try to adapt. And Bodnar seems to be doing that.

AI is shaking up marketing and distribution. Tools like Claude and Manus might make basic campaign automation a commodity.Recently, one update in the AI feature has nearly killed her startup. San Francisco entrepreneur Ira Bodnar might have lived every founder’s nightmare. Her startup, Ryze, had hundreds of paying clients and was growing fast. Then, seemingly overnight, a single update to Anthropic’s Claude made her product feel almost useless. Sales that once closed at 70% dropped to 20%. It seems one feature, one connector update, can disrupt months of hard work. Bodnar’s team had built an AI agent to manage advertising across Google and Meta.Clients loved it, but Claude’s new capabilities, combined with Manus’ connectors, suddenly made that offering less special.The story spread quickly online. Some commented they were curious to chat about selling to B2B clients. Others said they wanted to build tools that could outperform Claude or Manus. A few noted that the landscape for ad management was changing so fast that brand, taste, and storytelling might be the last remaining advantages.Ryze automated ad management. That meant you could give it access to all your Google and Meta accounts and let it run campaigns for you. Pretty neat, experts comment, and reportedly, businesses loved it. It saved time, cut mistakes, and made campaigns simpler. For a while, the startup felt unstoppable. Bodnar reportedly watched their growth charts spike and felt that rush founders know all too well. Then major update, Claude came, which dropped her sales by more than half.It still can’t make changes in ad accounts. It only analyses data. No Google Ads access yet. But Bodnar warned that a few months down the line, it probably will. And if Claude or Manus gets full control, that might be a game-changer. One can almost see why Ryze felt obsolete overnight.Bodnar wrote that her team had anticipated shifts in the AI-ad space. Weeks before the big drop, they’d started pivoting. Now, Ryze helps huge ad agencies run complex workflows. Some clients reportedly manage 600 accounts with just six people, with crazy efficiency. The company has also integrated new analytics tools and custom dashboards, allowing teams to track campaigns in real time and adapt instantly. Bodnar’s startup might survive because it’s finding a niche that even AI can’t fully automate yet, giving them a unique edge in an otherwise crowded market.Anthropic has released Claude Sonnet 4.6, its latest and most powerful Sonnet model.It is a full upgrade with better abilities in coding, handling computers, long-text understanding, planning tasks, research work, and design. The model also introduces a 1-million-token context window (beta), meaning it can remember and work with much larger amounts of information. Developers report that Sonnet 4.6 performs far better than Sonnet 4.5 and is sometimes even preferred over the more advanced Opus 4.5 model. Tasks that previously required a high-end model can now be done with Sonnet 4.6, especially office and coding work.The update also improves computer-use abilities and maintains strong safety standards, with researchers describing the model as safe, honest, helpful, and reliable.","Anthropic has released claude sonnet 4.6, its latest and most powerful sonnet model.

Buyers can also opt for Samsung Care+, which covers accidental damage repairs, extended warranty, and expert support both domestically and internationally, Samsung saidThe Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra is the first mobile phone in the world to feature a built-in Privacy Display – a hardware and software achievement that Samsung claims as a big change in how personal data is protected on a smartphone. This tech in the display is integrated at the pixel level, controlling how light is dispersed so that the screen remains clear and comfortable for the user while restricting visibility from side angles.Furthermore, users can decide when the feature activates — such as when entering PINs or opening specific apps — and choose between two modes: Partial Screen Privacy, which limits visibility for notification pop-ups, and Maximum Privacy Protection, which further blackens the screen from side views.The feature works in both portrait and landscape orientation with minimal impact on battery or usability, Samsung claims.Under the hood, the Samsung Galaxy S26 Ultra gets a Snapdragon 8 Elite Gen 5 SoC, which is customised specifically for Galaxy devices. According to the company, the chipset brings gains in CPU performance by 19%, NPU performance by 39% and GPU performance by 24%. To cool the phone, Samsung says it has fitted a redesigned Vapor Chamber with thermal interface material placed along the sides of the processor.Now coming to the camera, the Galaxy S26 Ultra carries a quad-camera setup: a 200MP primary sensor, a 50MP ultra-wide camera, a 50MP telephoto lens with 5x optical zoom, and a 10MP shooter.

“whether they act as important gateways between businesses and consumers”

“effective in addressing practices that limit competitiveness or are unfair in the cloud sector.”

Microsoft’s offices in Japan were recently raided by the country’s antitrust regulator. These raids came as part of an investigation into suspected unfair trade practices linked to the software giant’s cloud business. A Nikkei Asia report cited sources familiar with the matter to claim that the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) is examining whether Microsoft Japan improperly restricted customers of its Azure platform from using competing cloud services.The regulator is probing a potential violation of the Antimonopoly Act and is also expected to seek clarification from Microsoft’s parent company in the United States. The report cited sources to claim that Microsoft Japan is suspected of setting conditions that either made it difficult to use its software on non-Azure cloud platforms or resulted in higher fees for customers choosing alternative services.Azure competes with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud in the global cloud market, and the raid is part of the JFTC’s efforts to ensure fair competition in the growing technology sector. According to the report, Microsoft may have relied on its market position in products such as Windows Server and Microsoft 365, with its Japan subsidiary suspected of steering customers toward Azure by limiting access to these widely used services on rival cloud platforms.Apart from Japan, regulators in Britain, Europe, and the United States have also been examining Microsoft and other companies over their cloud computing practices. Last month, Brazil’s antitrust authority opened an administrative investigation into Microsoft’s local unit in connection with its cloud services.In November 2025, the European Union opened an investigation into Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure to determine whether the two cloud platforms should be subject to rules aimed at limiting the market influence of major technology companies.The European Commission said the companiesand that it would assessunder the Digital Markets Act.The regulator also said it would examine whether the rulebook designed to address anti-competitive conduct isThe EU’s scrutiny of cloud platforms followed several industry outages that disrupted global services and raised concerns about reliance on a limited number of providers.A Microsoft spokesperson at that time said the company stands ready to contribute to the commission’s market inquiry. In contrast, a spokesperson for Amazon’s AWS unit said it is confident regulators will find that the cloud market provides choice and innovation.This came after an outage affecting Amazon’s cloud services in October 2025, which lasted around 15 hours and disrupted operations at hundreds of companies, including Apple, McDonald’s and Epic Games. Microsoft’s Azure also faced issues in October that prevented passengers from checking in for Alaska Airlines flights and interrupted voting activities in the Scottish Parliament.At that time, the European Commission said the investigation into AWS and Azure is expected to conclude within 12 months, with a final decision on the regulatory approach for the cloud sector under the Digital Markets Act likely within 18 months.",Japan fair trade commission (jftc) is examining whether microsoft japan improperly restricted customers of its azure platform from using competing cloud services.

Kylie Kelce on Podcast Fame, Interviewing Michelle Obama, Motherhood & Marriage To Jason Kelce

""I'm annoyed that she was a secret traitor for some reason,""

""So, for some reason, her being a secret traitor has irked me to a degree I can't explain.""

""I wanted her to have her best chance to team up with people... If she were a traitor but not the secret traitor, I think she would have nailed it because she's just too sweet,""

While the Kelce family is no stranger to the spotlight, the drama usually happens on the football field or a concert stage. However, a new kind of tension has surfaced following Donna Kelce’s recent entry into competitive reality television. In a candid appearance on thepodcast this morning, Kylie Kelce revealed her ""honest feelings"" about her mother-in-law's brief but buzzy stint on Season 4 ofDonna Kelce, the beloved mother of Travis and Jason Kelce, shocked viewers when she was revealed as the show’s first-ever ""Secret Traitor."" Unlike the standard villains of the show, Donna’s identity was hidden even from her fellow Traitors, leaving her to navigate the game in complete isolation.Speaking with host Beau Allen, Kylie Kelce didn’t hold back her frustration with how the show’s producers handled ""Mama Kelce."" Despite Donna being eliminated after just two-and-a-half episodes, the fallout is still a hot topic in the Kelce household.Kylie admitted during the podcast.Kylie argued that the twist actually put Donna at a disadvantage, preventing her from forming the ""sneaky"" alliances that typically help Traitors survive.Kylie added.While Kylie expressed her frustration with the game's mechanics, she remained supportive of Donna’s decision to keep the family in the dark while filming. Previously, Kylie toldthat Donna ""did not tell us much at all,"" a move she respected despite her desire for an ""inside scoop.""Even with the early exit, Donna’s time in the Scottish Highlands was far from a failure. She made history as the first contestant to hold the ""Secret Traitor"" title and proved she could hold a poker face with the best of them even if it ""irked"" her daughter-in-law in the process.As for Kylie, don't expect to see her in a hooded cloak anytime soon. During the same conversation, she shut down rumors of her own reality TV future, joking that she'd rather be behind the camera than in front of it. For now, the Kelce family seems happy to leave the ""traitorous"" behavior to the professionals or at least to the next season of Peacock’s hit show.","Donna kelce was revealed as the first-ever ""secret traitor"" on the show.

Shane Bieber continues steady performance while building new chapter with Toronto

A short Instagram story from Kara Maxine Bieber offered fans a quiet look at life beyond baseball. The photo showed a carefully arranged snack board filled with grapes, crackers, cheese, sliced meats, and small bites topped with jalapenos. It felt warm and personal, set up at home rather than at a public outing.Alongside the image, she wrote, “don’t forget to take your man on a date.” The message was simple but meaningful. While her husband Shane Bieber continues his work on the mound, Kara’s post highlighted the importance of making time for each other even during a demanding baseball season.Kara Maxine Bieber, is originally from Northern California. She met Shane Bieber while attending the University of California, Santa Barbara. Before becoming known to baseball fans, she had an athletic background of her own. She played both basketball and volleyball and also competed in rodeo events.Shane and Kara tied the knot on January 21, 2023. In March 2025, they became parents to their son, Kav McClain. Since welcoming him, their social media has featured more family moments mixed in with baseball updates.Her recent post fits into that story. It was not dramatic or flashy. Instead, it showed intention. A simple reminder that relationships need attention, especially when professional schedules are busy.While Kara shared a glimpse of home life, Shane Bieber has remained focused on his performance. In his recent season with Toronto, he has made seven starts, recording a 4 and 2 record with a 3.57 earned run average.Bieber’s career has had strong stretches before. In 2022, he took the mound 31 times and picked up 13 wins with a 2.88 ERA. Back in 2020, he dominated in 12 games with a 1.63 ERA. Even in limited appearances in 2024, he did not allow an earned run.Those numbers show the kind of pitcher he has been over the years. Control and composure have always been part of his game. Now with Toronto, he is focused on staying healthy and building consistency start by start.Kara’s recent post did not mention baseball at all. It did not need to. It simply showed that even during a busy season, small efforts matter. While Bieber handles his work on the mound, life at home continues to move forward too.","Kara maxine bieber’s instagram story showed how she and shane bieber balance life beyond the field.

"Buy or sell: Stock recommendations for February 26, 2026 by brokers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/buy-or-sell-stock-recommendations-for-february-26-2026-by-brokers/articleshow/128800708.cms,"Nomura initiated its coverage of Lloyd Metals with the target price at Rs 1,600. Analysts said that supported by low-cost iron ore assets to 2057, vertical integration into steel, predictable (MDO) earnings, and diversification into copper, LMEL is transitioning from a pure-play miner to a more stable, diversified and less cyclical business model. They estimate LMEL to generate consolidated earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) of Rs 10,900 crore by FY28F from Rs 1,900 crore in FY25, implying a compounded annual growth rate 77%. The risks include a delay in steel capacity, political unrest in the Democratic Republic of the Congo affecting copper business, BHQ beneficiation not yielding the same results as seen in the pilot project, and resurfacing of Naxal activities.BoFA Securities upgraded Vedanta to buy from neutral with the target price raised to Rs 840 from Rs 480. Analysts said they upgraded the stock given a bullish view on aluminium, supportive silver prices, and a healthy dividend yield. Moreover, significant deleveraging at the parent company level minimizes risk of an increase in brand-fee rates or inter-corporate loans. They raised FY26-28 expected EBITDA by 16-21% as they incorporated higher aluminium forecasts, higher fair value of HZ, depreciation of the rupee, and a reduced holding-co discount of 5% (vs 15% earlier).Jefferies has a buy recommendation on Adani Enterprises with the target price at Rs 2,750. Analysts said FY27 as a key ramp-up year for the company, led by scale up at airports (particularly Navi Mumbai Airport), copper (smelter utilization) and roads (Ganga Expressway). New industries will focus on solar manufacturing expansion. And the recent capital raise will strengthen the balance sheet. Analysts also said that the company’s data centre business is targeting 210 MW capacity over the next 18–20 months. And the company’s playbook remains to incubate new businesses to scale using operating leverage.CLSA has an outperform rating on TCS with the target price at Rs 3,593. Analysts said that TCS has partnered with ServiceNow to accelerate large-scale AI adoption for enterprises. ServiceNow has grown strongly, backed by a strong order book implying similar growth for system integrators around SaaS implementation having strong partnerships with these platforms. ServiceNow has partnered with foundation model companies like Anthropic and OpenAI which improves the customer experience on the platform. However, they said that TechM has the strongest ServiceNow capabilities across Indian and global peers.Elara Capital has upgraded Garden Reach Shipbuilders & Engineers (GRSE) to reduce from sell with the target price raised to Rs 2,300 from Rs 2,030. Analysts said the value of the next generation corvette (NGC) order from the Indian Navy has been raised 32% to Rs 33,000 crore and its order book is seen reaching lifetime high of Rs 50,000 crore by March 2026. Analysts see defence order pipeline at Rs 1.5 lakh crore and non-defence at Rs 1 lakh crore over the next 12–18 months. For the company, the revenues would commence in FY28 with the first ship delivery scheduled in FY31, followed by one ship every six months. The company has also announced a Rs 3,000 crore capex for greenfield expansion at Kandla and Bhavnagar. GRSE’s target price is based on 35x Dec 2027 core shipbuilding value plus cash value.","Nomura initiated its coverage of lloyd metals with the target price at rs 1,600.

Megyn Kelly explains why she has not criticized Candace Owens over Erika Kirk series





Megyn Kelly did not stay quiet this time. On February 24, the former Fox News host strongly denied a viral rumor that claimed she secretly helped Candace Owens produce an investigative series about Erika Kirk. The rumor started after Owens released a trailer for her new project titled Bride of Charlie. Soon after, social media users began accusing Kelly of being involved behind the scenes. An X user named Max Twain posted, “Rumors are swirling that Megyn Kelly helped Candace Owens produce her Erika Kirk series… Kelly is said to have screened an early cut of the series and offered legal advice to Owens’ production team to help limit their liability to a defamation suit.”Megyn Kelly quickly fired back. She replied, “Are you a lunatic? Rumors are swirling that you are. Also a filthy liar. That one is actually confirmed.” Her response came as online criticism grew. Many users had already been asking her to publicly condemn Candace Owens for the series.The controversy started after Candace Owens released the trailer for Bride of Charlie, a series focused on Erika Kirk, the widow of Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk . The trailer faced backlash online, with critics saying it showed Erika Kirk in a negative light.Many conservative voices urged Megyn Kelly to speak out against Owens.However, this is not the first time Kelly has addressed questions about Owens. On February 9, Megyn Kelly appeared on Piers Morgan Uncensored. During that episode, Piers Morgan criticized Candace Owens for comments she had made about Erika Kirk and Brigitte Macron. He called Owens’ remarks “a regrettable kind of conspiracy theory.”Morgan directly asked Kelly why she would hesitate to slam Candace Owens. In response, Megyn Kelly said she had criticized Owens “many times” over the years and had engaged in several “public fights” with her. She explained that she does not feel the need to respond to every controversy involving Owens.Now, with the new rumor accusing her of helping produce the series, Megyn Kelly has made her position clear. She denied any involvement and directly attacked the claim as false. There is no confirmed evidence showing that Megyn Kelly screened the project or gave legal advice to Candace Owens’ team.

Hegseth issues ultimatum to Anthropic to let military use co's AI tech as it sees fit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/hegseth-issues-ultimatum-to-anthropic-to-let-military-use-cos-ai-tech-as-it-sees-fit/articleshow/128794899.cms,"



Washington: The Pentagon has delivered an ultimatum to Anthropic, the only AI company currently operating on classified military systems, ordering the firm to bend to its demands by Friday. If the firm fails to agree by 5.01pm Friday (local time), defence secretary Pete Hegseth said that the Trump administration would invoke the Defense Production Act, compelling the use of its model by the military and labelling the company a supply chain risk, according to a senior Pentagon official. That step would put Anthropic's govt contracts at risk.The two threats are fundamentally at odds: one would prevent the govt from using the company's products, while the other would force the company to let the govt use the products.Despite the contradiction, the threats reflect the level of anger in the top ranks of the Pentagon toward Anthropic for resisting its demands and how important the company's model has become to the military.Hegseth summoned Dario Amodei, Anthropic's CEO, to the Pentagon on Tuesday for a meeting. The tone of the discussion was civil, but when Anthropic did not agree to Hegseth's demands, he levelled the threats against it, according to people briefed on the meeting.Anthropic has argued that it was asking for reasonable assurances that its model would not be used for surveillance of Americans or in autonomous weapons, such as drone operations, that did not involve human oversight. Anthropic's supporters have contended that the company is being punished for being first on the classified system and creating a special model, Claude Gov, that does not have the same guardrails and restrictions that their models available to the public have. Pentagon officials have said using software and weapons lawfully is their responsibility, one they take seriously. But the officials say they cannot effectively allow all their contractors to specify how the equipment they sell to the Pentagon will be used.While the Defense Production Act gives the Pentagon wide-ranging powers, it is usually invoked in manufacturing contexts. It would be unusual for the act to be used on a software company, forcing Anthropic to make its product available for free. An Anthropic spokesperson said the company wanted to support the govt but needed to ensure its models were used in line with what they could ""reliably and responsibly do.""","Anthropic is the only ai company currently operating on classified military systems.

An Indian Redditor shared the professional struggles they have to go through in the US unless they are selected in the H-1B visa lottery. The H-1B registration for 2027 opens on March 4 but the Redditor said the company already informed him that he won't be sponsored, even though it won't require a $100,000 fee as the Redditor is already in the US.""I arrived in the US in 2021. I was fortunate to secure an internship, worked extremely hard, and eventually earned a full-time offer.

That moment made me realize that loyalty to an organization does not always guarantee stability. Sometimes, despite your dedication, you can still be left behind,"" the Redditor said adding how his friends suggest marrying a US citizen for getting the visa ""I do not support this idea, as I believe it is both unethical and illegal,"" the Redditor said.Other Redditors commented how the American dream is dead, and H-1B is just a matter of luck. Many social media users commented that they moved to Canada even after having a valid H-1B visa as there is no future of H-1B workers in the US either. ""Literally got an email from HR that they wouldn't be pursuing my H1B this year. I'm in the same boat as you, didn't get selected 3 times but I moved to Canada instead.

The unconscious soundtrack of the doomscroll generation? It's phonk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/the-unconscious-soundtrack-of-the-doomscroll-generation-its-phonk/articleshow/128763387.cms,"



In the last month, the music artist with the largest audience across YouTube platforms wasn't Bad Bunny or Taylor Swift. It was Slxughter, a phonk producer. The term probably doesn't sound familiar, but anyone who's spent any time on social media has almost certainly listened to it.Maybe it's better to say ""heard it,"" since the overwhelming majority of people who consume phonk don't recognise it as a genre, let alone actively choose it. But it's constantly playing in the background during YouTube Shorts, TikTok or Instagram Reels. It can sound like electronic dance music, but also hip-hop, trap, funk or a mix of those. It can accompany dance clips, gaming montages, fan edits, workout content, sports highlights, motivational clips and anything aiming to convey high-energy vibes.Quietly making its way as the most popular music on vertical videos, phonk has become the unconscious soundtrack of a generation that spends hours doomscrolling online. And it has earned a fortune for its producers, often teenagers who can create a viral track from their bedrooms and become millionaires through royalties within a matter of months.""I've been waiting for this conversation for the past, like, five years,"" Kevin Meenan, 43, music trends manager at YouTube, said as an opening statement in a call.The reason someone like Slxughter has such a huge following on YouTube, Meenan explained, is that the monthly audience is calculated by combining ""classic"" YouTube views with the listenership on all YouTube platforms, including Shorts. This month, Slxughter's music reached 981 million unique users, more than twice Taylor Swift's (394 million) and more than six times Bad Bunny's (150 million).""Phonk is a sleeping giant,"" Josh Mateer, 34, head of A&R at SoundOn, TikTok's distribution platform for artists and labels, said in a phone interview. ""There is a huge juxtaposition between the volume of internet traffic around phonk and the sort of culture as an underground musical movement.""The roots of the genre date back to the Memphis, Tennessee, rap scene of the late '80s and '90s, when producers like Tommy Wright III and Three 6 Mafia began defining a raw, sinister sound marked by heavy bass, eerie lyrics, cowbells and hypnotic loops.By the end of the 2010s, Russian and Eastern European producers entered the scene. Tyler Blatchley, 41, co-founder of the phonk label Black 17 Media, was working at Sony at the time. In Dec2020, he heard an obscure track by Russian producer Kaito Shoma on TikTok and recognised some Three 6 Mafia lyrics. He contacted the group's DJ Paul and cleared the song for monetisation. It was the beginning of what is called drift phonk (from its use in clips of drifting cars) and the genre's explosion on social platforms.Today, Blatchley lives in a villa with a pool and basketball court one hour's drive from Miami. ""We don't even know how to pronounce half of them,"" he said. ""These kids are producers that work out of their bedroom from all over the world, and they're watching the algorithm to see what's popular on vertical video, and then they're adjusting the kind of music that they make accordingly.""The latest iteration of phonk is so-called Brazilian phonk. Initially dubbed Automotivo phonk, it got confused with Brazilian ""funk,"" an older genre with authentic Brazilian roots. It is this branch of phonk - more aggressive than drift, but in some cases more danceable - that pushed Slxughter to the top of the charts.","Phonk has become the soundtrack of a generation that spends hours doomscrolling online.

UAE urgently recalls 4 health products: What every consumer must know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-urgently-recalls-4-health-products-what-every-consumer-must-know/articleshow/128794676.cms,"UAE Health Product Recall: 4 Items Pulled for Safety Concerns, Unapproved Ingredients

UAE Authorities Slam Unsafe Health Products: Are You Using These Recalled Items?

Which health products were recalled in the UAE and why



“Super Immune+” (Unauthorised Ingredients): The EDE’s first recall notice flagged a supplement called Super Immune+, which was found to contain unapproved components, including dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE), molybdenum amino acid chelate and boron citrate, substances not authorised for use in food supplements in the UAE and potentially unsafe for consumers. Since it was not registered or approved by the EDE, the product is considered non-compliant and a public health risk. “WoundVite” by ZEN NUTRIENTS (Novel Ingredient Issue): The second supplement, WoundVite marketed by ZEN NUTRIENTS, was withdrawn after regulators identified the presence of a novel food ingredient that is not authorised under existing safety regulations in Europe or the UAE. Novelly formulated ingredients require rigorous scientific evaluation before approval, which this product had not undergone. Rosabella Moringa Capsule (Salmonella Contamination): A third recall concerned the Rosabella Moringa Capsule, which was linked with a salmonella contamination risk based on a safety update from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and coordinated with disease control authorities. Salmonella is a harmful pathogen that can cause serious gastrointestinal illness, particularly in vulnerable populations. Isotonac-4 (Quality Defects): The final product was Isotonac-4, a laboratory-related medical product that was recalled after inspections uncovered quality defects, including foreign particles and abnormal characteristics that could affect its safety and efficacy. The manufacturer and supplier were ordered to immediately withdraw the affected batches from all distribution channels.

Why these recalls of health products matter for consumers in the UAE



Unregulated Online Sales Are a Growing Risk - Many recalled products were being sold on online platforms without proper registration or approval. As digital shopping grows, so does the risk of unvetted supplements and medical items entering the market, sometimes with misleading claims or unsafe ingredients. The EDE has expressly warned consumers not to buy these products online or in stores.

Registration and Approval Are Mandatory - Under UAE law, all dietary supplements, medications and medical devices must be registered and approved by the relevant authority before being marketed or sold. Failure to comply can result in recalls, fines and legal action for distributors and sellers. Experts also remind online sellers and merchants that product registration is not optional, selling unregistered health products can attract regulatory penalties.

Failure to comply can result in recalls, fines and legal action for distributors and sellers. Experts also remind online sellers and merchants that product registration is not optional, selling unregistered health products can attract regulatory penalties. Safety Alerts Often Follow Global Signals - The recall of the Rosabella Moringa capsule illustrates how the UAE’s regulators work in coordination with global safety networks like the US FDA and disease control agencies to track contamination risks and issue recalls when necessary. This helps protect local consumers from hazards identified abroad before widespread use occurs domestically.

What consumers in the UAE should do now



Do not purchase or use any of the products named in the recall.

Check your existing supplies for brand names, batch numbers and expiry dates that match the recalled items.

Dispose of recalled products safely or return them to the point of purchase.

Report any adverse reactions or side effects to your healthcare provider and the EDE.

Avoid buying health supplements and medical products from unauthorised sellers or unregistered online listings.

UAE Recalls 4 Health Products: What You Need to Know About Super Immune+, WoundVite, and More





In a recent consumer safety alert, the Emirates Drug Establishment (EDE) has ordered the urgent recall of four health-related products from the UAE market due to serious safety concerns and regulatory violations. The recall affects three dietary supplements and one medical product and reflects the UAE’s heightened vigilance in protecting public health amid the rise of online sales and unregulated imports. Authorities have warned the public not to buy or use these items and have prohibited their distribution through pharmacies, e-commerce platforms and other sales outlets across the country.The regulator’s action follows safety reviews and inspections that identified unapproved ingredients, potential contamination and quality defects in these products — issues that could pose risks to consumers’ well-being if left unchecked. The EDE’s alerts are part of a broader push by health authorities to ensure that all health and medical products sold in the UAE meet strict quality, safety and regulatory standards.These recalls underscore the UAE’s proactive approach to consumer safety and regulatory enforcement, especially as online marketplaces and social-media–driven commerce have expanded the availability of health-related products that may bypass traditional oversight. Several broader trends and implications are emerging:If you live in or are visiting the UAE, here’s what health authorities recommend:Consumers can also contact the EDE directly for information on the recalls or queries about product safety certification and registration requirements.This recall comes amid a broader regulatory landscape where UAE authorities have been increasing product safety oversight. Last month, for example, various batches of infant formula, including well-known brands, were also voluntarily recalled after potential contamination concerns were identified. These moves reflect enhanced vigilance on both food and pharmaceutical safety fronts to prevent consumer harm.Beyond individual recalls, the Emirates Drug Establishment recently introduced new mechanisms to end monopolies on medical products and boost competition, thereby improving supply resilience while safeguarding quality standards in the pharmaceutical sector. This regulatory overhaul complements safety recalls by strengthening the overall health ecosystem.The UAE has issued an urgent recall of four health products, three supplements and one medical item, due to unapproved ingredients, contamination risk and quality defects. Products affected include Super Immune+, WoundVite, Rosabella Moringa Capsule and Isotonac-4, all of which were either unregistered or flagged for safety issues. Consumers are urged not to buy or use these products and sellers are banned from advertising or stocking them. The action reflects growing global and local coordination on health product safety and the UAE’s strict enforcement of registration rules.","The ede’s first recall notice flagged a supplement called super immune+ which was found to contain unapproved components. The second supplement, woundvite marketed by zen nutrients, was withdrawn after regulators identified the presence of a novel food ingredient.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128795111,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-19832,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
