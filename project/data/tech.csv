Here’s what Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath wrote on X (formerly Twitter)

""Here's something worrying from a recent earnings call of a beverage maker: Indian's are consuming more soft drinks than ever. Even Indian companies have said something similar. Remember, India is at the epicentre of the global diabetes epidemic.""

Diabetes is a ticking time bomb for India. We have the largest number of people with diabetes in the world.

There was a time when people used to call diabetes a rich person's disease. But that's no longer the case. According to a recent study, 21 crore Indians are living with diabetes.

Poll Do you believe increasing soft drink consumption is a significant health risk for India? No, I don't think so Yes, it's a serious concern

The scary part is the rate at which it's affecting young Indians. If you're a 20-year-old woman living in a city today, you have a 64.6% chance of developing diabetes during your lifetime. If you're a young man, your risk is also quite high at 55.5%.

But the sad part is there's a lack of awareness among people. About 27.5% of people with diabetes don't even know they have it. Even if they do know, very few people get treatment.

What makes this a serious crisis is that less than 20% of Indians have health insurance. Most Indians end up spending out of their pocket, which is a huge burden for poor and low-income households.

There's no magic bullet to solve this issue. We need multiple approaches, from public awareness campaigns, insurance coverage for the poor and vulnerable, to introducing early detection programs.

Simple lifestyle changes, like adding a few extra minutes of exercise each day or reducing time spent sitting, can make a big difference. Even small changes, such as walking or cycling for an extra five minutes a day, can lower the risk of diabetes.

We've been supporting founders and startups that are working on helping Indians become healthier, but this is a systemic challenge that needs all people involved—from individuals to the government—to take action.

Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath took to microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter) to raise concerns about increasing soft drink consumption in India. In the post, Kamath cited a worrying trend from a beverage maker’s recent earnings. “Indian's are consuming more soft drinks than ever,” he wrote without naming the beverage company. Kamath linked the increased consumption of soft drinks to a broader health issue, pointing out that “India is at the epicentre of the global diabetes epidemic”. Notably, this is the second time when Kamath has warned against rising cases of diabetes in the country. He previously shared a post in November last year, calling Diabetes 'a ticking time bomb for India.'Kamath quoted his previous post which he shared in November last year. He then wrote:","Zerodha co-founder and ceo nithin kamath took to microblogging platform x (formerly twitter) to raise concerns about increasing soft drink consumption in india.

US woman praises India’s 10 best traits on social media

1. Affordable healthcare

2. Extensive and cost-effective public transportation

3. Rich and diverse food culture

4. Strong community and family bonds



5. Culture of resourcefulness and sustainability

6. Affordable and high-quality education

7. Vibrant festivals and cultural celebrations



8. Hard work and resilience

9. Flexible and adaptive labor market

10. Strong social networks and community support



India, a nation known for its rich cultural heritage and rapid economic growth, often surprises foreigners with its unique blend of tradition and modernity. One such admirer is Kristen Fischer , an American expat living in India, who recently highlighted ten practical aspects of Indian life that she believes the country excels at, compared to other parts of the world. In an Instagram video titled ""Things India Does Better,"" Fischer shared her firsthand observations on why India stands out, praising its affordability, strong community support, and cultural vibrancy. Her insights provide a refreshing perspective on the everyday strengths of Indian society that often go unnoticed.India’s healthcare system stands out for its affordability and accessibility, a factor that Fischer highlighted as one of the country’s biggest strengths. Unlike many Western countries where medical treatments can lead to financial strain, India offers high-quality medical services at a fraction of the cost. This affordability extends to everything from routine check-ups to complex surgeries, making healthcare accessible to a larger section of the population.Additionally, India is known for its world-class hospitals and medical professionals, with cities like Chennai, Mumbai, and Delhi emerging as medical tourism hubs. Patients from around the globe often travel to India for treatments like heart surgeries, joint replacements, and cosmetic procedures, drawn by the combination of advanced technology and cost-effectiveness.India boasts one of the world’s largest and most cost-effective public transportation networks. Fischer praised the country’s extensive rail system, which spans over 68,000 kilometers, connecting even the remotest corners of the nation. This network is complemented by affordable buses, autorickshaws, metros, and app-based ride-sharing services, providing convenient travel options for millions every day.For instance, the Delhi Metro, known for its punctuality and cleanliness, has become a model for other cities, while local trains in Mumbai are the lifeline for the city’s bustling workforce. The affordability of these options makes daily commuting more economical compared to many Western countries, where public transport can be significantly more expensive.Indian cuisine is renowned worldwide for its vibrant flavors, rich spices, and immense variety. Fischer noted that India’s diverse food culture is not only delicious but also remarkably affordable. From street food like samosas and chaat to elaborate regional dishes like Rajasthani thalis and Hyderabadi biryani, India offers a gastronomic experience that caters to every palate and budget.Moreover, the widespread use of fresh, locally sourced ingredients and centuries-old cooking techniques contribute to the health benefits and distinct flavors of Indian dishes. India’s food culture also emphasizes hospitality and sharing, reflecting the country’s deeply rooted community values.One of the most distinctive aspects of Indian society is its emphasis on close-knit family structures and strong community ties. Fischer highlighted this as a key strength, noting that Indian families often live together, providing a robust support system for both emotional and financial well-being.In India, it is common for multiple generations to share a household, creating an environment where family members can rely on each other during tough times. This sense of togetherness extends beyond the family unit to include neighbors and local communities, fostering a deep sense of belonging and mutual support.Fischer also praised India’s culture of resourcefulness, where people often repair, reuse, and recycle items rather than discarding them. This mindset minimizes waste and promotes sustainability, reflecting a practical approach to everyday living.In rural areas, this resourcefulness is evident in the widespread use of traditional farming techniques, reliance on locally sourced food, and innovative approaches to water conservation. Urban households, too, are increasingly embracing sustainable practices, from composting to using solar power, driven by a growing awareness of environmental issues.India’s education system, while facing challenges, also stands out for its affordability and quality. Fischer noted that India is home to some of the world’s most prestigious institutions, like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs), which offer top-tier education at a fraction of the cost compared to their Western counterparts.This affordability extends to primary and secondary education, where many public and private schools provide high-quality instruction at reasonable fees, making education accessible to a broader population.India’s festivals, known for their color, energy, and inclusivity, are among the most vibrant in the world. Fischer appreciated the way these celebrations bring communities together, fostering a sense of unity and shared joy.From the lights of Diwali and the colors of Holi to the spiritual fervor of Eid and the grandeur of Durga Puja , Indian festivals reflect the country’s deep-rooted traditions and diverse cultural heritage. These celebrations often include family gatherings, community feasts, and elaborate rituals, creating lasting memories for participants.Fischer also highlighted the hardworking nature and resilience of Indians, who show remarkable adaptability in the face of challenges. This resilience is evident in the country’s thriving startup ecosystem, its rapid economic growth, and the determination of its people to overcome adversity.India’s labor market is known for its flexibility, which has fueled the growth of industries like information technology, business process outsourcing (BPO), and manufacturing. This adaptability has made India a global outsourcing hub, attracting companies from around the world seeking cost-effective solutions.Finally, Fischer emphasized the importance of strong social networks in India, where communities often come together to support each other during difficult times. This sense of community is reinforced by cultural values that prioritize relationships and collective well-being.","Us woman praises india’s 10 best traits on social media.

Melinda French Gates’ dream which changed her life

Melinda Gates says she suffered panic attacks

Microsoft founder Bill Gates ex-wife Melinda French Gates has revealed that a recurring dream played an important role in her decision to end her 27-year marriage. The divorce, which was finalised in 2021, followed the surfacing of certain information that impacted the couple's relationship. In a recent interview Melinda French Gates revealed that she experienced recurring nightmares in late 2019. She claimed that the dream turned out be a turning point in her journey.In an interview with enterprenuer Jamie Kern Lima, French Gates described her symbolic dream. Melinda French Gates described that in her dream, she saw that she was standing on a cliff along with Bill Gates and their children. As the dream progressed, the portion of the cliff where she stood began to crumble and break away. This imagery had a profound effect on her, which she interpreted as a clear sign that she needed to separate from Bill and move forward on her own.“I was going to have to make a decision—and I was going to have to make it by myself,” she recalled.""Some dreams will take me years to understand, but if they’re recurring, I know I need to pay attention to them,” added Melinda Gates.While the dream served as a catalyst, Melinda's decision was also influenced by other factors. While she did not disclose specific details, Melinda acknowledged that certain things came out publicly, reinforcing her decision to leave the marriage. She referenced Bill Gates’ past meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, which she described as deeply disturbing. Bill has previously admitted that associating with Epstein was a mistake.In a recent candid interview with The Times, French Gates addressed Bill Gates’ remarks about their divorce. She said, “If you can’t live your values out inside your most intimate relationship, it was necessary.”French Gates also opened up about the emotional strain of the divorce, sharing that she experienced panic attacks throughout the separation. “When you’re leaving a marriage, it’s very, very hard. And the negotiations were tough,” she said.She shared that her first panic attack occurred in 2014 while having lunch with Gates, prompting her to begin therapy. “I’d heard of people having panic attacks and I didn’t know if it was a real thing,” she said.Initially skeptical of therapy, French Gates admitted she later came to understand its value. “It doesn’t mean I’m damaged,” she explained. “It means I’ve been through some difficult things that I need to figure out.”Following the divorce, both Bill and Melinda Gates have continued their philanthropic efforts, though they are no longer working together as a couple. Bill Gates has publicly expressed regret about the divorce, acknowledging his role in the dissolution of their marriage.","Melinda french gates has revealed that a recurring dream played an important role in her decision to end her 27-year marriage to bill gates.

“As part of our ongoing work to make our teams and programs operate more efficiently, and to better align with our product roadmap, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles.”

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy’s plan to cut bureaucracy at company

Amazon has reportedly fired 100 employees within its Devices and Services division . According to a report by Reuters, the company said the jobs represented a small number of the total for the unit and were part of its regular business review. The Devices and Services unit is responsible for developing popular hardware products such as the Echo smart speakers, Fire TV devices, and Ring security systems. To recall, Amazon also laid off some employees from Alexa-related jobs in 2023.In a statement given to Reuters, Amazon spokesperson said,While the full scope of the layoffs remains unclear, reports indicate that a variety of teams within the Devices and Services unit have been affected. This suggests a broad restructuring effort rather than targeting a specific product line.The layoffs come as Amazon continues to navigate a challenging economic environment. Like many other tech companies, Amazon has been focused on cost-cutting measures to improve efficiency and profitability. These measures have included workforce reductions across various divisions. Amazon has not yet released an official statement specifying the reasons for this particular round of layoffs.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees that building large teams and personal fiefdoms is not the path to advancement at the company, emphasizing instead that the e-commerce giant rewards those who accomplish more with fewer resources. Jassy's comments came during a recent all-hands meeting as Jassy continues his push to reduce management layers and bureaucracy across the organization.The CEO highlighted Amazon's commitment to operating with the agility of ""the world's largest startup"" despite its size. This initiative includes a recently completed effort to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by 15% across the company. Rather than massive layoffs, Amazon achieved this goal by combining teams and moving some managers into individual contributor roles.Jassy also stressed the importance of meritocracy over bureaucracy in Amazon's corporate culture. He mentioned reviewing more than a thousand employee emails sent to a dedicated ""No Bureaucracy"" alias, which has already resulted in 375 process improvements.",Amazon has reportedly fired 100 employees within its devices and services division.

Why Fortnite is blocked again on iOS

""Apple has blocked our Fortnite submission so we cannot release to the US App Store or to the Epic Games Store for iOS in the European Union.""

Reasons for the latest block

App Store policies : Apple’s strict guidelines on app submissions, including payment methods and security requirements.

: Apple’s strict guidelines on app submissions, including payment methods and security requirements. Legal disputes : Ongoing legal challenges that have not fully resolved the core issues between the two companies.

: Ongoing legal challenges that have not fully resolved the core issues between the two companies. EU Digital Markets Act (DMA): While third-party app stores are allowed in the EU under the DMA, Epic claims that Apple has still blocked its attempt to distribute Fortnite via its own store, raising questions about compliance with EU regulations.

: Players who relied on iPhones and iPads for Fortnite gaming will face interruptions, affecting cross-platform play. Revenue loss for Epic: The block is likely to impact Epic’s revenue from mobile players, who account for a significant share of in-game purchases.

The ongoing battle between Apple and Epic Games has taken a new turn, with Apple recently blocking the reinstatement of the popular game Fortnite on its US and EU App Stores. As per reports, this move has effectively made Fortnite unavailable on iOS devices globally, leaving millions of players without access to the game on their iPhones and iPads. The situation marks a significant escalation in the long-running dispute between the two tech giants over app store policies and digital revenue sharing.Despite a partial legal victory in 2023 that allowed Epic to direct users to its own payment methods, Apple has now blocked a fresh attempt to reinstate Fortnite on its US App Store, according to a statement from the official Fortnite account on X (formerly Twitter). The post read:This new block impacts both US and EU iOS users, effectively making Fortnite inaccessible globally on Apple devices.The conflict between Apple and Epic Games began in August 2020 when Epic introduced a direct payment option in its Fortnite app, bypassing Apple's 30% commission on in-app purchases. This move violated Apple’s App Store guidelines, leading to the immediate removal of Fortnite from the store. Epic responded by filing a lawsuit against Apple, accusing the tech giant of maintaining an illegal monopoly over app distribution and in-app payments.The latest block affects millions of Fortnite players worldwide, as iOS remains one of the largest gaming platforms. Key impacts include:",Apple has blocked fortnite on its us and eu app stores. Epic claims apple has still blocked its attempt to distribute the game via its own store. This move has effectively made fortnle unavailable on ios devices globally. The situation marks a significant escalation in the long-running dispute between the two tech giants.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121210592,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-91392,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

In a world driven by technological advancements, the smartphone stands out as one of the most transformative inventions of the 21st century. It has revolutionised communication, reshaped business, and brought the vastness of the internet into the palms of billions. However, alongside these undeniable benefits, smartphones have also introduced a host of psychological, physical, and social challenges that threaten human well-being.Decades ago, Baba Vanga , the enigmatic Bulgarian mystic known for her eerily accurate prophecies, reportedly warned about a small, addictive device that would dominate human lives, leading to widespread mental distress and social decay. As smartphones become ever more entrenched in daily life, her chilling prediction appears more relevant than ever. This article delves into the profound impacts of smartphone addiction, highlighting the health risks, psychological consequences, and societal challenges that echo Vanga's grim vision.Baba Vanga, often referred to as the "" Nostradamus of the Balkans ,"" is known for her unsettlingly accurate prophecies. Among her many predictions, one stands out in the context of modern technology – a warning about humanity’s growing dependence on small electronic devices. Although Vanga made this prediction long before the smartphone era, her vision seems to perfectly capture the modern phenomenon of mobile addiction. She foresaw a future where these devices, initially celebrated for their convenience, would disrupt human relationships, undermine mental health, and alter the fabric of society.Her prediction aligns eerily with the reality of today, where smartphones have become indispensable but potentially dangerous tools, contributing to anxiety, social isolation, and physical health problems.Smartphone addiction is not just a problem for one generation – it spans all age groups, affecting children, teenagers, adults, and even the elderly. This widespread impact reflects Vanga’s prophecy of a technology that would infiltrate every aspect of human life.Children are among the most vulnerable to the effects of excessive smartphone use, as their developing brains are particularly sensitive to digital stimuli. According to a report by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) in India, nearly 24% of children regularly use smartphones before bed, a habit that disrupts sleep patterns and cognitive development.Adults are not immune to the lure of smartphones. In fact, they often face even more profound consequences due to the high-pressure environments of work and personal life.The physical and psychological effects of smartphone addiction are severe, often leading to long-term health issues that can be difficult to reverse.The impact of smartphone addiction extends beyond individual health, disrupting social dynamics and weakening family relationships.Given the widespread impact of smartphone addiction, it is crucial to adopt strategies to reduce screen time and restore digital balance.","Baba vanga’s chilling warning about smartphones impacts different age groups.

TikTok is back online after suffering a major outage on that left thousands of users unable to access the popular video-sharing platform for approximately 4-5 hours. Users from across the United States complained of server connection issues and reported that their videos, user pages, following feeds, and For You Page displayed zero likes and views.Website Downdetector, which tracks problems reported by users, registered a huge spike in complaints at approximately 4:30 p.m. ET on Thursday, with reports peaking at over 33,000 by 4:45 p.m. Of those reports, 79 percent indicated problems with the app, while another 19 percent reported server connection issues.The social media giant acknowledged the issue in a statement, explaining that the problem occurred due to higher traffic than usual. ""The issues appear to have been caused by higher traffic than normal on our servers in Virginia, causing temporary service disruptions,"" a TikTok spokesperson said.Users reporting outages were initially concentrated in New York, Washington, D.C., Houston, and Seattle, according to Downdetector data.

'Military-linked company'





HONG KONG: Chinese EV battery giant CATL aims to raise $4 billion in its Hong Kong listing scheduled for May 20, said a statement filed to the bourse Monday, making it the largest IPO expected in the city so far this year.A global leader in the sector, CATL produces more than a third of all electric vehicle (EV) batteries sold worldwide, working with major brands including Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen.The company is already listed in Shenzhen, and its plan for a secondary listing in Hong Kong was announced in a December filing with the stock exchange.According to a prospectus filed Monday, CATL will offer approximately 117.9 million units priced at up to HK$263 per share ($33.8) for total expected proceeds of HK$31.01 billion.The listing is set to take place next Tuesday (May 20).Cornerstone investors, including Sinopec and Kuwait Investment Authority, agreed to buy shares worth HK$2.62 billion, the prospectus shows.Founded in 2011 in the eastern Chinese city of Ningde, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (CATL) was initially propelled to success by rapid growth in the domestic market.But the world's largest EV market has more recently begun to show signs of flagging sales amid a broader slowdown in consumption.The trends have fuelled a fierce price war in China's expansive EV sector, putting smaller firms under huge pressure to compete while remaining financially viable.But CATL continues to post solid performances, with its net profit jumping 32.9 percent in the first quarter.Funds raised from a secondary listing could be used to accelerate CATL's overseas expansion, particularly in Europe.The battery giant is building its second factory on the continent in Hungary after launching its first in Germany in January 2023.In December, CATL announced that it would work with automotive giant Stellantis on a $4.3 billion factory to make EV batteries in Spain, with production slated to begin by the end of 2026.Earlier analysts said CATL's float could be a blockbuster initial public offering that could boost Hong Kong's fortunes as a listing hub.Hong Kong's stock exchange is eager for the return of big-name Chinese listings in hopes of regaining its crown as the world's top IPO venue.The Chinese finance hub saw a steady decline in new offerings since Beijing's regulatory crackdown starting in 2020 led some Chinese mega-companies to put their plans on hold.In a list issued in January by the US Defense Department, CATL was designated as a ""Chinese military company"".The United States House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party highlighted this inclusion in letters to two American banks in April, urging them to withdraw from the IPO deal with the ""Chinese military-linked company"".But the two American banks JPMorgan and Bank of America are still on the deal.Beijing has denounced the list as ""suppression"", while CATL denied engaging ""in any military related activities"".According to Bloomberg, CATL plans to make the deal as a ""Reg S"" offering, which doesn't allow sales to US onshore investors, limiting the company's exposure to legal risks in the United States.",Chinese ev battery giant catl aims to raise $4 bn in hong kong ipo.

(AI image)

US President Donald Trump’s dream to have Apple manufacture iPhones in America may end up pushing the smartphone’s price to thrice its current level! Market analysts indicate that manufacturing iPhones in the United States rather than India would result in a threefold increase in costs, raising the price from $1,000 to $3,000 per unit.The comments come on the back of Trump's Thursday announcement regarding his conversation with Apple CEO Tim Cook, wherein he asked Apple to restrict its Indian expansion plans.China currently handles 80% of Apple's manufacturing operations, providing employment to approximately 5 million people. Tim Cook's recent announcement regarding manufacturing in India indicates a strategic shift of operations from China to India to establish a diverse supply chain network.Also Read | Donald Trump warns Apple about ‘Make in India’, will Tim Cook-led iPhone maker listen? A potential relocation of Apple's manufacturing operations from India to the US or other Western nations would result in increased labour expenses, leading to higher production costs. Apple would likely need to accept reduced profit margins to maintain competitiveness, despite the advantages of operating closer to Western consumer bases.In response to Trump's statement, the Director General of MCCIA, Prashant Girbane, told ANI: ""A lot better thought would prevail both in the Apple company and the US administration.” They would realise the following facts. First, if they decide to manufacture in the USA as compared to China, India, or Vietnam, a $1,000 iPhone would cost $3,000. Are American consumers willing to pay $3,000 for that iPhone?""""The manufacturing and jobs are not moving away from the USA to India, they are moving from China to India so that they would have a diversified supply chain, and American companies and consumers are protected right from the hegemony of one country that is not most friendly with them in terms of trade.,""Girbane added.Despite the present controversy surrounding this statement, Girbane said that the situation is expected to normalise eventually.Also Read | Donald Trump says India has offered a trade deal with ‘literally no tariffs’ According to NK Goyal, TEMA Chairman, ""By now, the world and India know that we have to wait for some time before we react to the statements made by the US President. As far as Apple is concerned, they have turned out more than 22 billion dollars worth of iPhones from India in the last one year. Apple has three manufacturing facilities in India and plans for two more.""Goyal further elaborated that Apple had already initiated partial relocation of its manufacturing from China to India.""It will be the commercial judgment of Apple whether to start manufacturing. They partly moved to India from China. If Apple moves out of India, it will be in big losses because the tariff restrictions are coming up globally and are subject to change very often. We firmly believe, as the Telecom Equipment Manufacturing Association, Apple will not go out of India,"" Goyal said.Jaideep Ghosh, who previously served as a partner at KPMG, noted that iPhone production in India reached Rs 1.75 lakh crores in FY 2025, ending March, an increase from Rs 1.2 lakh crores in the previous year. ""Apple ecosystem is quite important for India,"" he stated.He cautioned about potential consequences if Apple withdraws from India in the future, particularly affecting the country's markets and job sector. ""It's not easy to begin manufacturing iPhones in the US,"" he further remarked.","Manufacturing iphones in the united states rather than india would result in a threefold increase in costs, raising the price from $1,000 to $3,000 per unit.
