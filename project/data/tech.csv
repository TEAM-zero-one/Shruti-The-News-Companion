Face it! Men's makeup is a booming beauty business,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/face-it-mens-makeup-is-a-booming-beauty-business/articleshow/118516520.cms,"Face it! Men's makeup is a booming beauty business

For the longest time, men wearing makeup have been used as a comedic trope in Indian films. With plump red lips, unruly wigs, and rosy cheeks, they either impersonated women to fool cops in heist thrillers or were made the butt of 'gay' jokes in scenes with a roaring laugh track. Cut to 2025, however, and the world of men's makeup is on our screens for a different reason.In an episode of popular startup pitching reality show 'Shark Tank India', Ahmedabad's Rahul Shah stood in front of the judges, pitching Yaan Man - India's first makeup brand exclusively for men. Shah, who worked for five years as a cosmetic formulator in the US, returned to India in 2018 to break taboos.""In the US, I saw a lot of heterosexual men from Asia and other parts of the world using makeup to hide their dark circles, acne, and improve their skincare. But in India, most brands who even catered to men were only focusing on beard and hair care,"" Shah says.The path was not that easy, though. When he discussed his idea of selling concealers, foundation, and tinted moisturisers for men suited to Indian skin tones and weather conditions, people around him, including his friends, laughed. Most of them were reluctant to even use a proper face wash or apply sunscreen, forget anything else. Despite the taboos, he knew there was a growing market for it. After all, traditional players like Lakme India and MAC Cosmetics have introduced products for men, while representation has been growing - thanks to the glassy skin of K-drama heartthrobs and the videos of male beauty influencers like Ankush Bahuguna raking in millions of views.In fact, data by consumer research firm Mintel shows that one in every five beauty and personal care products launched in India since July 2022 was targeted at men - the biggest share for the category in the Asia-Pacific markets. Though the Indian market is smaller than that of China and Japan, the report adds, it is growing at a much faster rate, with the Indian male grooming category valued at more than Rs 10,000 crore.Social media has been the main catalyst for this shift, says Mumbai-based makeup artist Karan Chugh. ""For the longest time, heterosexual men associated taking care of their physical appearance to only going with the gym and oiling their beards. However, with access to trends from across the world, they realise now that this need not be the case."" In terms of products, concealers and tinted lip balms have become quite popular in the last year or two, he adds.A number of brands Chugh works with are also hiring male models for campaigns centred around beauty. A recent social media campaign he worked on for Nykaa Cosmetics, for instance, features 28-year-old Hindi film actor Gurfateh Singh Pirzada wearing nothing but an apron (and makeup). Centred around Valentine's Day, Pirzada stars as 'Pookieman', posing with a bunch of gender-neutral lip products, with names like Lip Glaze, Lip Cloud, and Butter Bomb - quite a shift from the matte black 'machoness' that male grooming products have traditionally relied on.This shift is not just limited to the sets of a reality show or the glittery world of Mumbai. Mohammed Maaz Khan, who hails from Rampur village in Uttar Pradesh, says he was more into fashion than all the other boys in his college. During Covid, he started posting grooming content online. A few of them went viral, and he was even featured on Instagram's official account. A chemical engineering graduate, Khan went on to pursue a course in cosmetology. However, the journey wasn't smooth as body butter. ""Initially, I faced a lot of criticism. A number of people asked me if I was transgender and used slurs. They couldn't digest what they were seeing,"" Khan says.His attempt to normalise makeup led him to start posting the beauty routines of Bollywood and TV actors. ""Many men admire actors and aspire to look like them but aren't aware of the products they use to look that way,"" Khan adds. He soon began posting about the benefits of using face serums, BB creams, CC creams and tinted lip balms, along with advice for tackling dark circles and wrinkles.Soon, his inbox was flooded with requests from curious men who wanted to know more. Several grooms-to-be reached out too, to enquire about the right products to look good on their wedding day. ""A lot of them would never have walked up to someone in real life and asked these questions out of fear of being ridiculed. But messaging someone online helped them overcome that,"" points out Khan, who has over 6 lakh followers on Instagram today.Meanwhile, Yaan Man founder Shah says the broader shift in Indian men's mentality will not happen overnight, but the response from users has been far better than expected. ""A lot of men are still hesitant to post public reviews or talk about it. But they're buying more and more products,"" he says. Now, he wants to double down on them, with four more products already in the pipeline scheduled to be launched later this year.","One in every five beauty and personal care products launched in india since july 2022 was targeted at men. Indian male grooming category valued at more than rs 10,000 crore. Social media has been the main catalyst for this shift, says mumbai-based makeup artist karan chugh.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118516555,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-876845,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

On Jan 29, India witnessed Isro's 100th rocket launch when GSLV-F15 rocket launched navigation satellite NVS-02. He urged people to observe National Science Day by spending “One Day as a Scientist”, which he said will foster curiosity among children and youth about science.On the country’s space sector achievements, Modi said, “Champions Trophy is going on these days and there is an atmosphere of cricket for everyone. We all know the thrill of a century in cricket. But today, I am not going to talk about cricket, rather I will talk about the wonderful century that India has made in space. Last month, the country was a witness to Isro's 100th rocket launch. This is not just a number, but it shows our resolve to achieve ever-new heights in space science. Our space journey started in a very normal manner. There were challenges in every step, but our scientists continued moving forward achieving victory over them.”“With time, the list of our achievements in space flights continues to grow longer. Be it building a launch vehicle, success of Chandrayaan, Mangalyaan and Aditya L1 or carrying out the unprecedented mission of sending 104 satellites into space in one go with one rocket. The ambit of Isro's success has been quite large. In the past 10 years, around 460 satellites have been launched, in which many satellites of other countries are also included,"" the PM said.On growing women’s power in the industry, Modi said, “The participation of women power has been continuously rising in the space sector. I feel very happy seeing that today the space sector has become a favourite of the youth. For our youth who want to do something thrilling and exciting in their life, the space sector is becoming an excellent option for them.""Speaking about National Science Day 2025, which will be celebrated on Feb 28, the PM said that the interest and passion of youth in science matters a lot. ""You try to spend one day as a scientist. You must visit places like a research lab, planetarium or space centre that day. This will increase your curiosity about science. Like space and science, India is rapidly making its mark in another field. That is AI (Artificial intelligence). I went to Paris to take part in an AI summit. There, people lauded India's strides in the field of AI,"" PM Modi said.He also mentioned a teacher from Telangana, Thodasam Kailash, who is harnessing AI technology in digital song and music to help preserve the tribal languages, including Kolami. His tracks are being liked a lot by the tribal people. ""People of India are second to none in adopting and using new technologies,"" he said.","Pm narendra modi hailed isro, saying it has hit the century in space.

NEW DELHI: India was implementing seven projects worth $750 million in partnership with the US Agency for International Development (USAID), which has been at the centre of controversy since US President Donald Trump alleged funding for elections in the country.The money - $97 million (around Rs 825 crore) in 2023-24 - was used for seven projects covering agriculture, forest and climate adaptation, water and sanitation, renewable energy, health and disaster management, the finance ministry said in its annual report for the last financial year.In its previous report also the ministry had listed the same set of projects but did not mention the extent of funding for 2022-23. In fact the projects have remained unchanged for the last few years, with around $70 million each provided for FY22 and FY21, the annual reports said.The finance ministry said the US has been providing bilateral development assistance since 1951 and it is largely thorough USAID. Over the last 73 years, USAID has provided economic assistance of $17 billion for 555 projects spread over multiple sectors, the ministry said.","The money - $97 million (around rs 825 crore) in 2023-24 - was used for seven projects.

Ranveer Allahbadia is in the middle of a firestorm. His controversial question on Samay Raina ’s—a disturbing hypothetical about incest—set the internet ablaze.That was the question. It didn’t take long for outrage to follow.Maharashtra Chief Minister Devendra Fadnavis publicly condemned him, and an FIR was filed. The backlash grew fast, with major names weighing in. While figures like Uorfi Javed and Kashish Kapoor argued that he had apologized and people were dragging the issue, the damage was done.

“Inko dekh ke kisi Logan walo ka Prime drink yaad aaya 😂,”

“It looks like Prime’s third copy (not that Prime is good or something). They will def use Ruchika for promoting this chapri brand and getting views. Sasta Prime 😭.”

Fokus hit the market in February 2025, and yes, it’s significantly cheaper than Prime

“It’s like Prime... but for people who think 500 bucks is too much for a drink.”

Fans are already calling Fokus a copy of Prime, but will it actually sell?

Fukra Insaan (Abhishek Malhan) and Triggered Insaan (Nischay Malhan) just entered the hydration drink market, but instead of praise, they’re getting roasted. Their new drink, Fokus, looks eerily similar to Prime, the hydration brand by KSI and WWE Superstar Logan Paul . The colors, the branding, even the bottle design—it’s all too familiar.Social media caught on immediately.One Reddit user didn’t hold back:basically calling Fokus a knockoff. Another user added,People aren’t mad. They’re just having fun with how obvious the similarities are. Fokus seems to be banking on the same influencer-heavy marketing strategy that made Prime popular, except at a much lower price point.Having hit the market in February 2025, Fokus is being marketed as an affordable hydration drink, available in flavors like Mango Pineapple, Kiwi Lemon, and Watermelon Strawberry. The drink contains coconut water, taurine, and ginseng extract, ingredients meant to provide hydration and energy.And the price? A three-pack costs Rs. 450. That’s way cheaper than Prime, which is ridiculously overpriced in India. One Redditor put it best:Fokus is clearly aiming at the younger crowd, the same people who built Fukra Insaan and Triggered Insaan’s careers. The two YouTubers have been posting behind-the-scenes content about the drink’s development, with their managers Mayank Mishra (Fukra Insaan’s manager) and Ankit Madaan (Triggered Insaan’s manager) handling the business side of things.The internet can’t unsee the similarities. From the branding to the influencer-driven promotions, Fokus is walking the same path that made Prime a global hit. But while people love making fun of the “Sasta Prime” branding, they’re still paying attention.Also Read : Amid backlash and threats from ex-WWE star, Ranveer Allahbadia recounts ‘hyper offensive humor’ pitch to Bollywood bigs Fokus launches across India in February 2025.

Aston Martin Unveils the AMR25: A New Era in Formula 1 Racing



Aston Martin has officially unveiled the AMR25, their latest Formula 1 race car, showcasing it online before pre-season promotional filming in Bahrain. After a challenging 2024 season filled with setbacks and missed podium opportunities, the team is gearing up for a comeback in 2025. The introduction of the AMR25 reflects Aston Martin's determination to regain its competitive edge, backed by strategic leadership changes and a fresh design approach.The 2024 season saw Aston Martin struggling to maintain the momentum they had in 2023, finishing fifth in the Constructors' Championship but with a significant drop in points from 280 in 2023 to just 97 in 2024. This decline highlighted the widening gap between Aston Martin and the top four teams. To address these challenges, significant leadership changes were made. In October 2024, Andy Cowell joined the team as Group CEO and later transitioned to Team Principal in January 2025, taking over from Mike Krack, who became Chief Trackside Engineer.Additionally, the recruitment of Adrian Newey from Red Bull marked a major strategic move, although his impact on the AMR25 is not expected this year. His presence is highly anticipated, with hopes that his influence will shape future models, particularly with the regulatory changes coming in 2026. This strategic reshuffle is seen as a clear statement of Aston Martin's ambitions to climb the ranks in Formula 1.The AMR25 features a bold new design, including revamped sidepods with a deeply undercut profile to enhance airflow efficiency. The redesigned floor maximizes aerodynamic performance, while the front wing has been modified to improve low-speed downforce and cornering stability. These changes are aimed at making the car more driveable and competitive from the season opener in Australia.Team Principal Andy Cowell emphasized the team’s commitment to improvement, stating, ""I'm excited to get this season started and see the AMR25 hit the track tomorrow in Bahrain... Our aims are realistic with a view to how we can continually improve in all areas, especially as we, like all teams, approach a vital shake-up of the regulations in 2026.""Veteran driver Fernando Alonso remains optimistic, reflecting on the lessons learned in 2024 and looking forward to the season with the AMR25. He stated, ""We learnt a lot in 2024 and the team have been using that as a driving force as we head into this season... I'm excited to get back on track; I am ready to help this team get stronger and continue this journey with Aston Martin Aramco.""Lance Stroll echoed this enthusiasm, highlighting the hard work put in during the off-season and his eagerness to see how the new car performs on the track.Also Read: Why F1 drivers can’t choose number 17: The legacy behind the ban With the 2025 season set to be fiercely competitive and the team aiming for consistency, Aston Martin is looking to prove that their success in 2023 was no fluke.

As Meghan Markle is launching her product line under a new name As Ever, reports claimed that in October 2022, a Chinese clothing company named ASEVER objected to Meghan's brand. A Daily Mail report claimed that at that time, Meghan was planning to sell aprons and other items of clothing and also her jams and dog biscuits. However, she was barred from selling any clothing item because of the lawsuit from the Chinese brand.ASEVER is a Shenzhen-based company which supplies stores like H&M. Meghan's lawyers filed a revised application for a trademark and removed any mention of clothing and it was approved.This past lawsuit will have no bearing on her present company but she will never be able to sell anything related to clothes and her haters are wondering loud on social media if she can make anything unique.Meghan originally named her brand American Riviera but it was not allowed as it is a geographical location where she lives. The name was rejected as one can't have a patent on a location. Meghan said the name would have limited her products to the area and hence she decided on a new name.One clothing company with the same name 'As Ever' put out a statement that they have been in existence in New York since 2017 but they never applied to trademark the name. ""I'm a very small business. It's a family-run operation. I'm essentially a one-man brand.

How people are exposing themselves to scams

Signs of a romance scam

Asking for money or gifts (64%)



Using urgent or emotional language (49%)



Avoiding video calls or in-person meetings (41%)

Giving inconsistent answers (24%)



Evading personal questions (20%)

Asking overly personal questions (11%)



UK mobile network operator EE has issued an urgent warning about the dangers of sharing personal details online, particularly when dating. The mobile network provider found that many users are giving away sensitive information too easily, putting themselves at risk of scams and impersonation fraud.According to EE’s survey of 2,000 UK phone users, an alarming 93% admitted to sharing personal details over text, messaging apps, or social media. A significant number do so while chatting with new acquaintances or online dating. With Valentine's Day heightening social interactions, EE is urging people to remain cautious.""Online dating has opened exciting new options for singles, but also a novel channel for criminals hunting for new ways to defraud their victims,"" EE stated.Research shows that one in ten (11%) people currently dating have been targeted by romance scams . Even more concerning, one in five victims lost an average of £2,500 due to these fraudulent schemes.According to The Mirror, EE’s findings revealed that 65% of users shared their phone number, 51% disclosed their location and 35% provided access to their social media profile.Additionally, 345 respondents said they had noticed suspicious behaviour from someone they were messaging, while 15% had been directly asked for money.The main danger lies in trusting people who may not be who they claim to be. Fraudsters can use personal information to impersonate victims, potentially leading to identity theft and financial loss.Even non-EE customers should stay alert. Last year, during the Valentine’s period, EE recorded a sharp rise in scam texts. In February 2024 alone, the company blocked 12 million malicious messages—well above the usual monthly average of 8.9 million. The network expects similar activity this year.""Scammers are experts at preying on the vulnerable,"" warns Richard Wainer, EE’s regulatory affairs director. ""At this time of year, when social media is full of public displays of affection, it can be tempting to turn a blind eye to the red flags, but spotting them is more important than ever"", Wainer added.To help users stay safe, EE has identified key red flags to watch out for when chatting online:EE urges users to remain cautious when communicating with people they don’t know well, especially when emotions are involved.

Potential

spillover risk

Monitoring and

pandemic preparedness

A new bat coronavirus with the potential for animal-to-human transmission has been discovered by a team of Chinese researchers, raising concerns about possible future spillover events. The virus, named HKU5-CoV-2 , was found to use the same human receptor as SARS-CoV-2 , the virus responsible for Covid-19.According to the South China Morning Post, the study was led by Shi Zhengli , a renowned virologist known as ""batwoman"" due to her extensive research on bat coronaviruses.The research involved scientists from the Guangzhou Laboratory, Guangzhou Academy of Sciences, Wuhan University, and the Wuhan Institute of Virology . Their findings were published in the peer-reviewed journal Cell on Tuesday.The newly discovered virus belongs to the merbecovirus subgenus, which includes the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus. It is a new lineage of the HKU5 coronavirus, initially identified in Japanese pipistrelle bats in Hong Kong.The research found that HKU5-CoV-2 can bind to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor, the same receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to infect human cells. ""We report the discovery and isolation of a distinct lineage (lineage 2) of HKU5-CoV, which can utilise not only bat ACE2 but also human ACE2 and various mammalian ACE2 orthologs,"" the scientists wrote.The study warned that bat merbecoviruses ""pose a high risk of spillover to humans, either through direct transmission or facilitated by intermediate hosts.""According to the researchers, HKU5-CoV-2 can bind to ACE2 receptors in multiple animal species, increasing the likelihood of interspecies transmission.Despite its potential for human infection, the researchers cautioned against exaggerating the threat. They noted that the virus’s efficiency in binding to human ACE2 is “significantly lower” than that of SARS-CoV-2. ""The risk of [HKU5-CoV-2] emergence in human populations should not be exaggerated,"" they said.Earlier this month, Cell published a study by researchers from the University of Washington in Seattle and Wuhan University, which concluded that while the HKU5 strain could bind to bat and other mammalian ACE2 receptors, it did not show ""efficient"" binding to human ACE2.However, Shi’s team countered that HKU5-CoV-2 appears to be better adapted to human receptors than its predecessor, lineage 1, and ""may have a broader host range and a higher potential for interspecies infection,"" South China Morning Post reported.Given the potential risks, the researchers focused on the need for further monitoring. The World Health Organization has already included merbecoviruses on its list of emerging pathogens for pandemic preparedness.Shi Zhengli, who played a key role in Covid-19 research, has previously denied claims that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was responsible for the pandemic.While the origins of Covid-19 remain debated, some studies suggest the virus originated in bats and jumped to humans through an intermediate host.","A new bat coronavirus with the potential for animal-to-human transmission has been discovered by a team of chinese researchers.

Google Pay, a prominent UPI ( Unified Payments Interface ) platform, has begun implementing a convenience fee for utility bill payments , including electricity and cooking gas bills. Previously free for low-value transactions, the service now charges between 0.5% and 1% plus GST for payments made using credit and debit cards. With this, Google Pay now follows some other UPI apps like PhonePe and Paytm that charge similar fee.This development follows the platform's previous implementation of a Rs 3 convenience fee for mobile recharges implemented over a year ago.A review by ET revealed that a customer paid approximately Rs 15 as ""convenience fee"" whilst settling an electricity bill with a credit card. The charge, which included GST, was also described as a ""processing fee for debit and credit card transactions"".An industry insider explained to the financial daily that the introduction of platform fees for bill payments by Google Pay indicates a wider movement towards monetising UPI transactions , as service providers aim to recover payment processing costs.

The platform processed UPI transactions worth Rs 8.26 lakh crore as of January.According to an informed source, charging convenience or platform fees is standard practice in the industry. The source indicated that while Google Pay previously covered this expense, it has now opted to transfer the cost to users.Google Pay's website indicates that while convenience fees apply to card payments, UPI transactions linked directly to bank accounts remain fee-free. The timing of when these charges were introduced remains unclear.For specific bill payments including water, piped gas and electricity, PhonePe implements convenience fees on card transactions, as stated on their website. Similarly, Paytm levies platform fees between Rs 1 to Rs 40 for UPI recharges and various utility bill payments, including gas, water and credit card settlements.UPI's widespread adoption hasn't translated into substantial revenue for fintech firms. PwC's study reveals that processing UPI person-to-merchant transactions costs stakeholders approximately 0.25% of transaction value.
