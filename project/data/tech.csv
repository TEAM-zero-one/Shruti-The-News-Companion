MobiKwik loses Rs 40 crore in 48 hours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mobikwik-loses-rs-40-crore-in-48-hours/articleshow/123933014.cms,"GURGAON: Taking advantage of what is believed to be a glitch that blindsided city-based digital wallet company MobiKwik's systems, around Rs 40 crore were allegedly siphoned off over two days, Sept 11 and 12, from the company's account through a blitz of UPI transactions.The fraud came to light on Tuesday after the arrest of six men whose accounts contained Rs 9 lakh of this stolen money. Uncannily, this is the second time this has happened to MobiKwik. In Oct 2017, the company was allegedly similarly defrauded of around Rs 19 crore with the money being moved to thousands of personal bank accounts. This time, the glitch happened after the company updated its software earlier this month, investigators said. It apparently allowed Mobikwik users to send much higher amounts of money than their wallet balances. Transactions, the investigators said, also went through if users entered incorrect PINs.Police said how scamsters came to know about this glitch is under probe. Officials said they suspected insiders' involvement. The fraud was reported on Sept 13 by a MobiKwik employee, citing an audit that had detected suspicious transactions on Sept 11 and 12.According to cops, fraudulent transfers over those two hours amounted to Rs 40.2 crore. ""Nearly 5 lakh transactions took place on Sept 11-12, and so far, 2,500 bank beneficiary accounts have been identified. We have managed to freeze Rs 8 crore out of the total fraud amount. This money was deposited in these bank accounts,"" said a source.Five of the arrested men are from Nuh. The other is from Palwal. The accused have been identified as Rehan, Waqar Yunus, Wasim Akram, Mohd Amir, Mohd Ansar and Mohd Sakil. All six have been sent to judicial custody.Police spokesperson Ashok Kumar said if any company employee is found to be involved in the scam, strict action will be taken against the individual. Nuh police on Tuesday, meanwhile, asked people to report by Sept 23 any unexplained cash transfers they might have received in their accounts.""If anyone received transactions on Sept 11 and 12 due to technical security lapses or other reasons via the Mobikwik app or received unauthorised payments through the app and wishes to return them, or has any complaints related to such transactions, they can visit the office of the SP. People from Palwal district and other Mewat areas can also come."" Nuh police said in a statement. They have been charged under Section 318(4) (cheating) and 314 (dishonest misappropriation of property) of BNS. Cops are also coordinating with banks to recover the money and identify others who benefited from the alleged fraud.""The company is undertaking all possible and necessary efforts to recover the amount. However, since the police investigation and recovery efforts have just started, it's not yet possible to ascertain the impact. Based on the preliminary data, as a risk mitigating measure, the FIR was lodged for an amount of Rs 40 crore, out of which, the company has recovered around Rs 14 crore. Thus, the estimated net impact is Rs 26 crore. The company is taking aggressive collection efforts while pursuing legal course of action to recover the full amount over a period of time,"" a company spokesperson told TOI.","The fraud came to light on tuesday after the arrest of six men whose accounts contained rs 9 lakh of this stolen money.

Why did Rep. James Comer call online platforms’ CEOs to testify?



What connects online platforms to the Charlie Kirk assassination investigation?



House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer has called for a high-profile hearing to investigate online platforms’ role in domestic radicalization. The hearing that has summoned the chief executives of four major online platforms will be scrutinizing their platforms’ roles in political incitement of real-world violence. The move comes after a recent tragic event that reignited debates on digital accountability. It’s being called a congressional effort to hold the tech companies accountable.The entire decision stems from the recent assassination of Charlie Kirk , a conservative commentator. It’s believed by the lawmakers that it might be linked to online radicalization. In the made, public announcement, Rep. Comer said, “Congress has a duty to oversee the online platforms that radicals have used to advance political violence.” He has explicitly stated that Humam Sakhnini, Steve Huffman, Dan Clancy and Gabe Newell, CEOs of Discord, Reddit, Twitch and Steam respectively, will appear before the committee on October 8, 2025.Comer’s aim in questioning these leaders is to prevent the platforms from being exploited for extremist purposes. Reportedly, it will be further identified whether there are any detectable warning signs or any business models that inadvertently facilitate such behavior.It has also been emphasized by Comer that CEOs will have to explain what actions they would take moving ahead, to prevent their services from being exploited for harmful purposes.Although the exact motivation of the suspect is still under investigation, the early reports have noted that he had his possible influence from the online forums. Comer, along with his colleagues, is reportedly concerned about the pattern that is emerging wherein digital communication platforms are repeatedly associated with high-profile crimes.Discord, Steam, Reddit and Twitch have previously faced scrutiny for hosting communities, where the extremist views at times thrive. These platforms, while they vary in functionality—from gaming to live streaming and more—they all enable real-time interaction as well as community formation. This often comes with limited visibility to the broader public.It’s suspected by the lawmakers that these digital spaces are becoming a 'communication of choice' for individuals who plan violent acts. While the companies do have moderation policies, it’s been argued by critics that they are inconsistently enforced.Discord has even agreed to cooperate by stating that it welcomes an opportunity to discuss critical issues with policymakers. October 8, 2025, hearing called as Congress duty would probe whether the tech giants are actually doing enough to curb dangerous content.",House oversight committee chairman james comer has called for a high-profile hearing to investigate online platforms' role in domestic radicalization.

He further revealed, “Steve Ballmer, at that point, did the opposite or end his own personal relationship with Aspiration.“In other words, Dan [Le Batard], the opposite happened from what the Clippers statement tried to convey before they knew we had mountains of documents”, Torre said.

Billionaire Richard Branson ignored on NYC streets while promoting ‘Doorbell of Dreams’



New Yorkers too busy to notice Richard Branson with a mic



Billionaire’s rejections spark laughter and praise online

British billionaire Richard Branson, best known as the adventurous founder of the Virgin Group, recently experienced an unusual moment on the streets of New York City. While promoting his latest initiative, Doorbell of Dreams, the 75-year-old tycoon tried stopping passersby for quick interviews, only to be repeatedly ignored. Despite his global fame, New Yorkers brushed past him as though he were just another man with a microphone. The incident, filmed by entrepreneur Simon Squibb, quickly went viral on Instagram, sparking amusement and admiration online. What began as a lighthearted campaign to encourage everyday dreamers to pitch their business ideas turned into an unexpected lesson in humility, showing that even billionaires are not immune to everyday rejection.During a lighthearted promotional event, Branson attempted to stop pedestrians for quick interviews. Despite his global reputation, most passersby ignored him, hurrying along as though he were just another stranger with a microphone. The unusual moment, filmed by entrepreneur Simon Squibb, quickly gained traction on Instagram, showing the tycoon facing rejection after rejection.This unexpected moment wasn’t just a publicity stunt; it was part of a campaign to promote “Doorbell of Dreams.”The initiative, launched by Branson in partnership with Squibb’s startup HelpBnk, invites everyday dreamers to pitch their business ideas in under 60 seconds.What makes the concept unique is its accessibility. Through a specially designed video doorbell, aspiring entrepreneurs can present their ideas, with the hope of receiving mentorship, guidance, or even investment. Originally launched in the UK, the project recently expanded to New York, where Virgin Hotels partnered as a venue for participants. The street interviews were meant to spark curiosity among locals and draw attention to the campaign.The video shows Branson politely approaching strangers with the question, “Can I ask you a question?” But instead of engaging, people brushed him off. One woman walked by without so much as a glance, while another looked briefly at him before rushing away, clearly preoccupied with her own thoughts and errands.For a man who has conquered industries from airlines to space travel, being ignored on the sidewalk was a rare and humbling experience. Squibb, amused by the scene, remarked, “A bit of rejection is healthy.” Branson laughed at himself and replied, “I’m not doing too well, am I?” Eventually, a passerby did agree to share his dream, stating his goal was to achieve financial independence, help others, and contribute positively to the world in meaningful ways.Once uploaded, the clip drew widespread attention on social media. Many users were stunned that a man of Branson’s stature could blend so seamlessly into the crowd. One viewer commented, “Richard Branson getting rejected? Unbelievable!” Another wrote, “Imagine ignoring one of the world’s most inspirational entrepreneurs who’s just asking you a simple question.”The rejections, however, were not seen as embarrassing but rather refreshing. Viewers praised Branson’s good-natured attitude and willingness to step into unfamiliar situations despite his status. A popular comment read, “This is what humility looks like. Sir Richard Branson has every reason to stay in his comfort zone, but he still pushes himself.”","Billionaire richard branson ignored on nyc streets while promoting ‘doorbell of dreams’ the 75-year-old tycoon tried stopping passersby for quick interviews, only to be repeatedly ignored.

Dubai Fountain to finally reopen after 5 months of renovation: Emaar reveals official date and exciting upgrades,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-fountain-to-finally-reopen-after-5-months-of-renovation-emaar-reveals-official-date-and-exciting-upgrades/articleshow/123971178.cms,"While the official reopening is October 1, Dubai Fountain performances won’t resume until early October to allow final preparations/ Instagram: EmaarDubai





Dubai Fountain reopening set for early October

What’s new at the Dubai Fountain





Here’s what’s changed:





A brand-new flooring system now replaces the old foundation, which was known to crack over time. The new base is made of shiny, reinforced concrete designed to better insulate and retain water, solving a recurring maintenance issue.





Beneath that floor lies a carefully engineered waterproofing layer and an insulation system, topped with glowing blue tiles. These tiles aren’t just for looks, they reflect beautifully through the water and are visible from any vantage point around the lake.





The fountain’s choreography now relies on a new generation of robotic systems, each designed for precision:



Choreography bots guide the movement of the water itself

Lighting bots match visual effects to musical cues

Fixed water jets, dozens of them, are reprogrammed to spray in perfect rhythm with each show’s score







The scale and legacy of the Dubai Fountain





Its jets can launch water up to 150 metres high



It features 6,600 lights and 25 colour projectors



Performances are choreographed to a diverse mix of classical, Arabic, and contemporary music





What to expect from the upgraded Dubai Fountain experience









After five months of silence, drained waters, and behind-the-scenes upgrades, the Dubai Fountain, the towering spectacle at the foot of the Burj Khalifa, is ready for its return. Emaar has officially announced that the world-famous attraction will be fully operational by October 1, 2025, marking the end of a massive redevelopment that touches nearly every element of the fountain’s structure and show. From state-of-the-art robotics to a brand-new underwater floor, this isn’t just maintenance, it’s a full-scale reinvention of one of Dubai’s most iconic landmarks.Dubai’s most-watched water attraction has been closed since April 19, 2025, as part of an intensive upgrade that saw the entire 30-acre Burj Khalifa Lake drained, exposing the massive infrastructure beneath the surface. Now, with the waters refilled and the giant digital display screens removed, the space is beginning to take its familiar shape once again. In a recent Instagram post, Emaar stated that the Dubai Fountain is expected to be fully operational by Wednesday, October 1, although the developer noted that the attraction will not resume performances until “early October.”The developer first broke the news via Instagram, noting that while work is nearly complete, operations will resume only once the team is confident that all systems, both technical and visual, are ready for a seamless experience. So while the date is marked, there’s still a margin for final tweaks before the relaunch.This was never just a cosmetic refresh. Emaar’s redevelopment focused on the structural foundation and performance technology — rethinking the fountain from the inside out.Every movement, every beam of light, every rise and fall of the fountain is programmed, and just a single song in the show takes several weeks of fine-tuning to execute correctly.The result is a completely rebuilt platform that still looks like the Dubai Fountain, but performs with a new level of power, elegance, and reliability.To appreciate the effort behind this upgrade, it’s worth revisiting what the Dubai Fountain actually is, not just in reputation, but in scale.Designed by WET Design, the same creators behind the Bellagio Fountains in Las Vegas, the Dubai Fountain made its official debut on May 8, 2009, alongside the opening of The Dubai Mall. Spanning 275 metres across the manmade Burj Khalifa Lake, it is the largest choreographed fountain in the world.With each show, the fountain has drawn millions of visitors, becoming a staple of Downtown Dubai and one of the most recognisable water performances on the planet.And despite the closure over the past few months, Emaar ensured that the space didn’t go quiet. During redevelopment, the site was fenced off, but not hidden. The barriers were embedded with digital screens, looping archival footage of previous shows in sync with the Burj Khalifa light display, allowing visitors to still engage with the spirit of the fountain even while it was offline.Once the Dubai Fountain resumes operations in October, visitors can expect a performance that feels both familiar and entirely refreshed.The sound and light systems have been enhanced, the choreography is sharper, and the integration of robotics promises smoother, more spectacular motion than ever before. The changes aren’t just technical, they’re immersive. These upgrades were built with both performance and maintenance in mind, ensuring the fountain can continue to run spectacular shows with fewer interruptions and less wear over time.And while the core elements, the music, the light, the water, will remain central to the experience, the visual clarity, dynamic precision, and overall grandeur of the show will reflect five months of engineering and design at the highest level.","Dubai's most-watched water attraction has been closed since april 19, 2025, as part of an intensive upgrade.

Meta unveiled its most advanced smart glasses yet at its Connect conference, introducing the $799 Meta Ray-Ban Display with a built-in screen and gesture controls, alongside updated versions of its popular Ray-Ban collaboration and new sports-focused Oakley frames.As the name implies, the Meta Ray-Ban Display features a full-colour, high-resolution display built into the right lens that activates only when needed, remaining invisible during regular use to avoid obstruction. Each pair includes the Meta Neural Band, an EMG wristband that reads muscle signals from subtle finger movements and converts them into commands for controlling the glasses.CEO Mark Zuckerberg demonstrated the glasses live on stage, showing how users can check messages, preview photos, see translations, get help from Meta AI, and navigate through content using simple hand gestures detected by the wristband. The Neural Band allows users to scroll by sliding their thumb across their gripped hand, select items by pinching thumb and index finger together, and adjust volume by rotating their wrist.The display glasses offer six hours of mixed-use battery life, with the charging case providing an additional 30 hours. The wristband itself delivers 18 hours of battery life and features an IPX7 water rating. Meta built the band with Vectran, the same material used on Mars Rover crash pads, making it strong as steel when pulled yet soft enough to bend comfortably.Meta’s Ray-Ban Display can do visual responses with Meta AI, messaging and video calling through WhatsApp and Messenger, real-time camera viewfinder with zoom, pedestrian navigation with turn-by-turn directions, live captions and translation, and music playback controls.Despite some technical hiccups during the live demonstration—including failed attempts at recipe requests and video calls—Zuckerberg emphasized that these are production-ready devices, not prototypes. ""This isn't a prototype. This is here, it's ready to go and you're going to be able to buy it in a couple of weeks,"" he stated.The glasses will be available September 30th at select retailers including Best Buy, LensCrafters, and Ray-Ban stores, with expansion to Canada, France, Italy, and the UK planned for early 2026.Meta also announced the Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2, an improved version of its bestselling AI glasses that have sold millions of units worldwide. The updated glasses nearly double the battery life of the original model, offering up to eight hours of use compared to the previous four-hour capacity.The Gen 2 model features significant camera improvements, including 3K Ultra HD video capture with ultrawide HDR and the ability to record at up to 60 frames per second. The charging case now provides 48 hours of additional power, up from 36 hours in the original version. New software features include ""conversation focus,"" which amplifies the voice of the person you're speaking with while filtering out background noise, and expanded live translation supporting German and Portuguese alongside existing languages. The Ray-Ban Meta Gen 2 starts at $379 and is available immediately in Wayfarer, Skyler, and Headliner styles.The Oakley Meta Vanguard targets high-intensity sports enthusiasts with specialised features for athletic performance. These $499 glasses integrate directly with Garmin devices and Strava, allowing users to ask Meta AI about heart rate, pace, and other fitness metrics in real-time without looking at their wrist or phone.The Vanguard features a wraparound design optimised for cycling helmets and hats, with IP67 dust and water resistance rating. The glasses include Meta's most powerful speakers yet—six decibels louder than previous Oakley models—and a five-microphone array designed to reduce wind noise. An autocapture feature works with Garmin to automatically record video clips when hitting distance milestones or ramping up heart rate and speed. The glasses offer nine hours of battery life and will be available October 21st, with pre-orders starting now.","The meta ray-ban display features a full-colour, high-resolution display built into the right lens that activates only when needed.

Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is preparing to introduce its latest wearable technology at the annual Connect event, which is widely seen as a showcase for its augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions, innovation roadmap, and future consumer experiences. This new product represents the company’s first consumer-ready smart glasses with an integrated digital display, signaling a significant step in Meta’s long-term strategy to bring advanced AI into everyday life and enhance human-computer interaction.The glasses, expected to retail at around $800, will carry the internal code name “Hypernova” and are likely to launch under the brand name “Celeste.” While the glasses’ display is relatively small, it is designed to handle basic digital interactions such as notifications, alerts, messages, and reminders, offering users a glimpse into the potential of AR without being fully immersive.Meta is positioning this launch not just as a gadget, but as a foundational element in its broader vision of wearable technology that interacts seamlessly with AI, potentially transforming the way people access information, collaborate remotely, and connect with the digital world.Over the past several years, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has committed enormous resources—more than $60 billion since 2020—into Meta’s augmented reality and AI divisions.The company envisions smart glasses as a key interface for what is sometimes referred to as “superintelligence,” a theoretical AI that surpasses human capabilities across nearly every cognitive domain.Meta already offers two existing lines of smart glasses in partnership with Ray-Ban and Oakley, which include AI-driven features like cameras, hands-free controls, and livestreaming capabilities to Meta’s social platforms. These products have achieved moderate consumer success, selling around two million units since 2023, making Meta one of the few tech giants to gain traction in the smart glasses market—a market where competitors like Google have struggled.The new Celeste glasses, however, are distinct from these earlier offerings. They represent a step toward more advanced AR capabilities, though they remain less sophisticated than the “Orion” prototype showcased last year, which was presented by Zuckerberg as a “time machine to the future.” Orion, slated for launch in 2027, is expected to be far more technologically advanced and consumer-ready for immersive AR experiences.Celeste will feature a small, integrated display in the right lens, offering essential functions such as notifications and alerts. Analysts have suggested that this modest approach allows Meta to introduce AR to the consumer market gradually, focusing on usability and developer engagement rather than attempting a full-fledged, high-cost immersive device right away.In addition to the glasses, Meta is expected to introduce a new wristband accessory that will allow users to control the device with hand gestures. This accessory enhances interactivity, letting users navigate the glasses without needing to touch them physically, and represents a step toward hands-free, seamless integration of AR into daily life.The company may also incorporate branding collaborations, with rumors suggesting that the Italian fashion house Prada could provide design input. Prada’s signature thick frames and arms could help house the necessary components for the display, battery, and sensors while giving the glasses a premium aesthetic.One of the primary concerns for Celeste is its price. As reported by Reuters, at approximately $800, the glasses are substantially more expensive than Meta’s existing Ray-Ban and Oakley lines, which start at $299 and $399, respectively. Analysts warn that this pricing could limit adoption to tech enthusiasts, early adopters, and niche markets, rather than appealing to a broad mainstream consumer base.Jitesh Ubrani, research manager at IDC, pointed out that the device is likely to be somewhat bulky, heavier than expected, and less consumer-friendly, predicting that sales might reach only a few hundred thousand units initially. Nevertheless, he emphasized that the launch could play a strategic role in attracting developers, encouraging innovative apps, and paving the way for more advanced, mass-market AR devices in the future.Meta’s innovation drive has not been without controversy. The company has faced scrutiny over its handling of child safety on its social media and virtual reality platforms. Whistleblowers have claimed that internal policies previously allowed AI chatbots to engage children in inappropriate conversations, and researchers were allegedly discouraged from investigating potential harms related to VR experiences. Meta has since revised these policies to prohibit such interactions and improve child protection measures.The timing of the Celeste launch highlights the tension Meta faces: the company is racing to maintain relevance in the AI and AR sectors while simultaneously responding to ongoing ethical and regulatory concerns. How it manages these risks will influence consumer trust and adoption of its new wearable products.A key component of the Celeste launch is Meta’s emphasis on developer engagement. The company plans to open the device to third-party developers through a new software kit, enabling external creators to build AR applications and utilities for the glasses.This approach reflects a long-term strategy: while initial sales might be modest, building a robust developer ecosystem is essential for creating a sustainable market for AR devices. By fostering innovation in apps and experiences, Meta hopes to expand the appeal of smart glasses and gradually transition toward more advanced, mainstream products like the Orion headset.","Meta platforms, the parent company of facebook and instagram, is preparing to introduce its latest wearable technology at the annual connect event.
