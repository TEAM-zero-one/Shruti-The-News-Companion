In a big cheer at the start of the festive season, the next generation GST reforms announced by the Modi government come into effect today, on September 22, 2025.From today, a plethora of household items, cars, TVs, bikes will become cheaper for the common man and middle class. Many food items have been moved to the NIL or 0% tax bracket. These include roti, parantha, paneer, khakra etc. Importantly, health and life insurance premiums will be exempt from GST.The new GST rates, first announced by FM Nirmala Sitharaman earlier this month, reduce the tax slabs to two broad rates - 5% and 18%. While most items under GST have seen rate cuts, some limited items will now also be dearer with higher tax rates - such as clothes priced above Rs 2,500 will now attract a higher GST rate of 18% compared to 12% before.Ahead of the GST rate cuts becoming effective, PM Narendra Modi addressed the nation saying, “With sunrise on September 22nd, the first day of Navratri, the Next Generation GST reforms will come into effect.In a way, a GST savings festival is going to begin in the country from tomorrow. This GST Savings Festival will increase your savings, and you'll be able to purchase the things you want more easily. The poor, middle class people, neo middle class, youth, farmers, women, shopkeepers, businessmen, entrepreneurs of our country, everyone will benefit a lot from this savings festival. ”“Due to reduction in GST, it will now be easier for the citizens of the country to fulfill their dreams. Be it building a house, buying a TV, a refrigerator, or buying a scooter, bike, or a car, you'll have to spend less on all of these. Travelling will also become cheaper for you, as GST has been reduced on rooms in most hotels,” he added.","New gst rates 2025: full list of items in 0%, 5%, 18% & 40% tax brackets.

Shipping ministry officials said this marks the most significant reform in the sector since Independence.Announcing the decision, I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said, ""Shipbuilding needs deep capital. Only those countries could save the shipbuilding industry historically that gave substantial support to industry."" The package has a four-pillar approach to strengthen domestic capacity, improve long-term financing, promote greenfield and brownfield shipyard development, and enhance technical capabilities and skilling.The three major schemes - Shipbuilding Assistance Scheme (Rs 24,736 crore), Maritime Development Fund (Rs 25,000 crore) and Shipbuilding Development Scheme (Rs 20,000 crore) - are expected to generate Rs 4.5 lakh crore investment and produce over 2,500 vessels. The move aims not only to attract global investment but also to reduce India's dependence on foreign ships, currently around 95%.PM Narendra Modi called the package a ""transformative push for maritime self-reliance,"" saying it will unlock 4.5 million Gross Tonnage capacity, generate jobs, and attract investment.Shipping minister Sarbananda Sonowal said the initiative is key to strategic independence, building resilient supply chains and enhancing maritime capabilities, reinforcing India's geopolitical resilience, and realising Aatmanirbhar Bharat through a developed maritime sector.Under the package, Shipbuilding Financial Assistance Scheme will be extended until March 2036. Vessels costing less than Rs 100 crore will receive 15% assistance, those over Rs 100 crore 20%, and green or hybrid vessels 25%. At least 30% domestic value addition is required to avail benefits. The scheme includes a ""ship breaking credit note,"" allowing shipowners to claim 40% of a vessel's scrap value when dismantled at an Indian yard toward constructing a new vessel.","The package has a four-pillar approach to strengthen domestic capacity, improve long-term financing, promote greenfield and brownfield shipyard development.

Mondelez adjusts prices across brands



End of ‘Magic’ price points?

Price-point packs still dominate sales





Popular price points of Rs 5 and Rs 10 are disappearing from India’s fast-moving consumer goods (FMCG) shelves. Parle-G, after two decades of selling its smallest biscuit pack at Rs 5, has now priced it at Rs 4.45.Other everyday items are also shifting- the Rs 1 candy now costs 88 paise, while a Rs 2 shampoo sachet is priced at Rs 1.77.The changes come as FMCG makers await clarity on how to pass on benefits under the next-generation GST reforms, which come into effect from Monday.The new GST structure, first announced by finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman earlier this month, reduces tax slabs to two broad rates – 5% and 18% – and moves many food items to the NIL or 0% tax bracket.Ahead of the reforms taking effect, Prime Minister Narendra Modi said Sunday, “With sunrise on September 22nd, the first day of Navratri, the Next Generation GST reforms will come into effect. In a way, a GST savings festival is going to begin in the country from tomorrow. This GST Savings Festival will increase your savings, and you'll be able to purchase the things you want more easily. The poor, middle class people, neo middle class, youth, farmers, women, shopkeepers, businessmen, entrepreneurs of our country, everyone will benefit a lot from this savings festival.Companies said they are waiting for government clarity on whether increasing product weight at the same price can be treated as a price cut under the new GST regime.“There will be an initial impact, but we expect consumers to either use UPI (Unified Payments Interface) for exact payments or opt for larger or multiple packs to round off the difference,” said Mayank Shah, vice president at Parle Products, as quoted by ET.“We are still awaiting clarity and hope to be allowed to pass on the tax cut through grammage increases” he added.Mondelez India, the country’s biggest confectionery maker, has moved all its products to nonstandard price tags.Bournvita now sells for Rs 26.69 instead of Rs 30, Oreo cookies at Rs 8.90 instead of Rs 10, and Gems and 5Star at Rs 17.80 instead of Rs 20.The company said the new maximum retail prices include GST benefits and distributors must pass them on to consumers.For decades, FMCG brands kept Rs 5, Rs 10, and Rs 20 packs as “magic price points” by reducing pack sizes during inflation. But with regulatory ambiguity, companies may move away from these low-cost packs temporarily.“The inconvenience of something in between magic price points is just too much for the larger industry,” said Prashant Peres, managing director at Kellanova India and South Asia.“So, in the short term, there will be some slashing of prices that we will do, or many others will do, because we just can't turn around the supply chain fast enough. But in the long term, it will be grammage, and we will go to those price points,” added Peres, as cited by ET.Despite the changes, small affordable packs remain vital for the industry. They contribute 79% of shampoo sales, 64% in biscuits, 58% in chocolates, 44% in salty snacks, and 29% in toothpaste.“At present, for all our existing stock, we have reduced the prices by 13% to establish a clear calculation that we have passed on all the benefits,” said Sushil Kumar Bajpai, president at RSPL Group, which makes Ghadi detergent and Venus soap. “Hence, all the price tags will reflect obscure numbers and the challenge is now to see how we can take a different and more simplified approach on newer stocks.”","Fmcg drops popular rs 5 & rs 10 packs from india's shelves.

US To Abandon H1-B Visa Lottery System, Trump Floats More Changes To Rules | Detailed Report

In the firing line

Silver lining for laid off tech workers with H-1B visas





Donald Trump’s H-1B visa fee hike may turn out to be a blessing in disguise for techies who have recently been laid off by firms like Oracle, Intel, Microsoft, and AWS. The recent H-1B visa fee hike to $100,000 for new applicants could encourage employers to consider recruiting H-1B holders who have recently been laid off.Since the start of 2025, 533 rounds of layoffs at technology firms have affected 144,926 individuals, according to data from monitoring platform Trueup reported by ET. The platform's data indicates that 2024 saw 1,115 rounds of staff reductions at tech organisations, impacting 238,461 professionals.Individuals on H-1B visas who face layoffs whilst holding an active visa status have a 60-day window to secure alternative employment or depart from the United States.""Some of the ones laid off might be getting a call back,"" said Navneet S Chugh, attorney at US-based immigration law firm Chugh LLC, whilst noting that current H-1B visa workers, renewals, re-entries and employer transfers remain exempt from this fee, as clarified by the White House on Sunday.""For employers that act quickly and navigate compliance effectively, recently laid-off H-1B professionals represent a ready-to-deploy talent pool,"" Sachin Alug, CEO of recruitment company NLB Services, told ET.""Because they already hold H-1B status, they can often transition through a transfer petition without re-entering the lottery, making them highly attractive in terms of speed and cost efficiency. ""Also Read | After $100,000 fee, Trump administration looks to abandon lottery system for H-1B visas; here’s the proposed new selection criteria A product manager in Mountain View, California, whose employment at a consulting organisation ended on September 8, was quoted as saying, ""The moment I heard the news, I thought my days in the US were officially over. But after the clarification, there is a renewed hope. I am aggressively applying and expecting recruitment calls over the next week.""According to Sanketh Chengappa KG, director and business head-professional staffing at Adecco India, many affected professionals might receive opportunities for rehiring or attractive offers from alternative organisations, creating a select pool of readily available talent for crucial positions, particularly in technology, engineering and strategic digital sectors.Major US corporations including Amazon, Meta, and Google are anticipated to benefit primarily from the H-1B visa modifications, as they possess the financial capacity to accommodate increased fees for skilled professionals, according to immigration specialists. The $100,000 fee corresponds to the annual compensation of a standard employee recruited through this programme, they indicated.""The impact on companies remains uncertain at this stage,"" remarked Debarghya Das, partner at US-based Menlo Ventures. ""The expectation is that IT services organisations and employers offering lower wages will bear the brunt, accounting for approximately 40-60% of all H-1B applications.""Also Read | Trump’s H-1B visa fee hike to backfire? Wall Street banks set to rely more on Indian GCCs; may deepen presence in India Technology corporations typically maintain a modest H-1B workforce, with under 15% of staff on these visas, and most applications from major tech firms being renewals, Das noted, adding,""Microsoft, for example, had less than 2,000 net new H-1B last year, which is $200 million in fees, a 0.6% increase in annual R&D (research and development) spend of $30 billion for the company. This may not be enough for them to significantly reduce H-1B hiring.""","Recent h-1b visa fee hike to $100,000 for new applicants could encourage employers to consider recruiting h- 1b holders who have recently been laid off.

Mark Zuckerberg’s failed bid for TikTok





Shou Zi Chew, the Singapore-born CEO of TikTok, today leads one of the biggest competitors to Mark Zuckerberg ’s Meta. But few know that at the start of his career, Chew actually worked for Zuckerberg. After earning an economics degree from University College London and later pursuing an MBA at Harvard Business School, Chew spent a summer internship at Facebook (now Meta), then an up-and-coming social media startup.After his brief stint in California, Chew moved through major financial and tech hubs including London, Singapore, and Hong Kong. In 2015, he joined Chinese smartphone giant Xiaomi , playing a key role in the company’s public listing three years later as its chief financial officer. His work at Xiaomi positioned him as a rising executive in Asia’s fast-growing technology sector.Shou Zi Chew’s career took a sharp turn in 2021, when he joined ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok. Initially appointed as CFO, he was later named CEO of TikTok the same year, while briefly holding both roles. Under his leadership, TikTok surged past 1 billion users globally, including an estimated 150 million in the United States, making it one of the few major platforms outside Zuckerberg’s reach.TikTok’s rise has long frustrated Meta. According to reports, Mark Zuckerberg tried to acquire Musical.ly in 2016, a lip-syncing app that later merged into TikTok after ByteDance bought it for $800 million. Meta’s own rival app, Lasso, failed to gain traction and was shut down in 2020.As TikTok’s influence grew in the US, so did the scrutiny in Washington over the app’s Chinese ties. Chew has appeared before US lawmakers to defend the platform from allegations of being a national security risk due to its Chinese ownership. During a 2023 hearing, he drew contrasts with Facebook’s own track record, saying: “American social companies don’t have a good track record with data privacy and user security. ”Zuckerberg has also voiced concerns about TikTok’s control by a foreign government but has also warned that banning the app could set a precedent for restricting online platforms.","Shou zi chew, the singapore-born ceo of tiktok, worked for mark zuckerberg.

According to the independent tracker Layoffs.fyi, more than 150,000 jobs were eliminated across 549 companies in 2024. This trend has carried into the new year, with over 22,000 workers already facing job reductions across the tech sector. According to a report by TechCrunch, 16,084 of these cuts occurred in February alone.As companies increasingly adopt AI and automation, this ongoing series of layoffs highlights the human impact of rapid technological change and the potential consequences for innovation across the industry. Here are some of the tech giants that have cut the maximum number of jobs this year.Earlier this year, Microsoft announced a plan to cut 9,000 employees, which represents under 4% of its global workforce. This is the latest in a series of reductions for the company this year, following cuts of less than 1% in January, more than 6,000 in May, and at least 300 in June.Chipmaker Intel is reportedly firing more than 5,500 employees across various US states, according to company filings.The tech giant had previously estimated a lower number of cuts, but has now stated the reduction is part of a plan to eliminate 24,000 to 25,000 jobs by the end of 2025. Intel stated the move is ""designed to create a faster-moving, flatter and more agile organization.""Salesforce has laid off another 4,000 employees from its customer support division, reducing its headcount in that department from 9,000 to 5,000. This reduction comes as the company focuses on artificial intelligence (AI), with AI agents now reportedly handling about one million customer conversations. The layoffs occurred despite the company reporting strong financial results.Google has also been affected by the layoff wave, with more than 200 contract workers laid off by GlobalLogic, a firm specialising in handling Google's AI rating projects. These contract workers reportedly believe they were used to train AI models that could eventually make their jobs redundant.US cloud service provider Oracle is continuing its large-scale job-cut drive across its global workforce. The latest round affected at least 254 employees in the San Francisco Bay Area, according to a company filing. Reports also indicate that workers in India, Canada, and parts of Europe have been impacted, including 101 employees in Seattle.Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump signed a new executive order that significantly increases the fees for H-1B visas, a move that can shake up hirings in the tech industry. The fee for new H-1B visas has been hiked by to $100,000, a measure aimed at discouraging major tech companies like Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Meta from hiring foreign workers.For Indian IT professionals, who have long relied on H-1B sponsorships for US jobs, this new policy presents a dual crisis: fewer available positions and substantially higher barriers to entry. According to the new order, the increased fees and rules will not apply to current H-1B visa holders or those seeking to renew their visas; they will only impact future applicants.","Microsoft's plan to layoff 9,000 employees is the latest in a series of reductions.

US To Abandon H1-B Visa Lottery System, Trump Floats More Changes To Rules | Detailed Report

'Real scenario...no job'



German envoy's open call to Indians got questioned by social media users who claimed that the real scenario in Germany is that there are no jobs for Indians.





Amid the H-1B row in the US which will make it harder for Indians to get a job in the US as companies will have to pay a hiked fee of $100,000 to hire foreign talent, Germany has now extended a red carpet for Indians after the UK and China. The video of Germany's ambassador to India Dr Philipp Ackermann has gone viral as he not only invite Indians but also took a dig at the US for its overnight change.""Indians are among the top earners in Germany. The average Indian working in Germany earns more than the average German working in Germany. And that's pretty good news. Because a high salary means Indians are contributing big time to our society and our welfare. We believe in hard work and giving the best jobs to the best people,"" he said.""Our migration policy works a bit like a German car. It's reliable, it is modern, it is predictable. It will go in a straight line with no zigzags. And you don't have to fear a full brake at the top speed,"" Ackermann said, adding that Germany does not change its rules fundamentally overnight.The video sparked off a major debate on social media platforms as many commented that the real scenario is that there is no job even with C1 proficiency in the language. ""Real scenario -- No job until and unless you r experienced and in IT or AI, Fresher jobs need language, language also plays a very significant job in Non IT jobs, currently the market is in mess and the most important of all you said we Indians earn more than Germans in average but do Germans themselves know that we pay that much amount of tax? Because they literally make us feel like we live on their money and tax!"" one commented on Instagram.""As an Indian living in Germany since a decade. Time has changed and job market is really bad. If you come with savings and don't find a job, you'll go back spending on high expenses. Just a ground reality check,"" another wrote.","German ambassador to india, philipp ackermann, took a dig at the h-1b row that the us created and invited skilled indians to germany.

'Rat people': What people are posting

How government is responding

What experts say





China on Monday said it is censoring 'negative' content online, adding to decades of surveillance and blocking of criticism against the Communist Party.Cyberspace administration of China announced a two-month campaign targeting content on social media, short-video apps, and live-streaming platforms, which are “maliciously misinterpret social phenomena, selectively exaggerates negative cases, and use them as an opportunity to promote nihilistic or otherwise negative worldviews. ”State-run media praised the campaign as a necessary step to restore order online, warning that negative content can cause panic and damage public trust.“The harm of such maliciously divisive content is significant. It can trigger collective misunderstandings and social panic, marginalise reason and facts, and even spark offline conflicts causing long-term damage to public order and social trust,” it wrote.The campaign comes at a time when China’s economic slowdown has hit young people the hardest. Growth in factory output and retail sales recently dropped to their lowest in months. Youth unemployment, excluding students, climbed to 18.9% in August, a two-year high.A long-running property crisis has weakened consumer confidence, reduced spending, and pushed youth unemployment higher.Many young Chinese have responded with lifestyles such as “lying flat,” a term that describes opting for a stress-free, simple life.Bloggers who shared this way of living online recently saw their accounts banned and videos deleted.New expressions of discontent continue to appear online, such as “rat people,” a trend where young people describe themselves as avoiding the outside world by staying in bed and relying on food delivery.Popular platforms like Weibo, Kuaishou and Xiaohongshu have also been punished for allowing “harmful” content, including celebrity gossip, to dominate trending lists.The regulator said it will also act against posts that spread fear, encourage hostility between groups, or promote “defeatist” ideas, such as “effort is useless.”It also warned against businesses that “sell anxiety” by exploiting people’s worries about jobs, education, or relationships.The regulator asked the public to “actively report such cases” in order to “stop the spread of negative sentiment.”Ja Ian Chong, a political science professor at the National University of Singapore, told CNN that many Chinese people feel pessimistic about their future.He said the government may be trying to boost confidence and spending by controlling public sentiment online. But he added that without real improvements in jobs and opportunities, changing online chatter may not change how people actually feel.“The state will try to clamp down on these new terms and expressions as they emerge, but they will simply continue to evolve,” Chong said.","China said it is censoring 'negative' content online, adding to decades of surveillance and blocking of criticism against the communist party.

"Dubai just super-sized its taxi game: Nearly 10,000 cabs now a tap away",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/dubai-just-super-sized-its-taxi-game-nearly-10000-cabs-now-a-tap-away/articleshow/124092239.cms,"Dubai just leveled up its ride-hailing game. Nearly 10,000 taxis, all bookable in seconds.

Big move in Dubai mobility: Thousand of taxis get digital liftoff

Meet the companies behind the mega-merge



Why riders and drivers should notice faster pickups, broader coverage, and more bookings

Shorter waiting times & greater availability: By pooling nearly 10,000 vehicles, the supply of taxis visible to riders spikes especially useful during peak hours, events and at busy hubs such as airports and tourist areas. Operators say this should reduce waits and the frequency of “no cars nearby” messages.



Better utilisation for drivers: For drivers it can mean steadier demand (more app options funneling passengers) and fewer idle miles between fares, as the platforms match trips across a larger aggregate fleet. DTC’s recent integrations with e-hailing platforms were explicitly aimed at improving utilisation and revenue per vehicle.



Payment and customer experience: Earlier fleet digitisation moves (such as the large rollout of DTC taxis onto Bolt earlier in 2025) included new payment and promo features consumers may see similar conveniences across the combined fleets.

How this fits Dubai’s smart-mobility roadmap

RTA targets and the bigger policy picture: The consolidation lines up with the Roads & Transport Authority’s goal of shifting 80% of Dubai taxi trips to e-hailing as the emirate digitises urban mobility. The DTC–Kabi tie-up accelerates that transition by putting more regulated taxis into the apps people already use.



Part of DTC’s five-year push: The deal sits inside DTC’s wider 2025–2029 strategy to expand digital services, sustainability and new mobility offerings, a push that already saw thousands of DTC vehicles go live on Bolt earlier this year.



Kabi’s rebrand and market positioning: Kabi (the rebranded Cars Taxi under Al Ghurair) has been rolling out a refreshed look and wider operations across the city, positioning itself as a modern, regulated private operator; joining forces with DTC on platforms gives Kabi immediate scale and digital reach.

What it means for you

we’ve got you covered, wherever you’re heading.





Dubai has done it again and this time it’s on wheels. Dubai Taxi Company (DTC) and Kabi by Al Ghurair just shook hands on a deal that throws nearly 9,880 taxis into the ride-hailing ring. That’s 6,200 from DTC plus 3,680 from Kabi, now united on your phone screens through Bolt and Zed apps. Translation? Whether you’re heading to DXB at 3 AM, zipping to JBR on a Friday night, or catching a ride after Expo events chances are, your cab is closer than ever.Dubai Taxi Company (DTC) and Kabi by Al Ghurair have signed a strategic alliance to integrate their fleets onto major e-hailing platforms - Bolt and Zed - combining DTC’s 6,200 taxis with Kabi’s 3,680 for a combined 9,880-vehicle network. The aim: better coverage, shorter waits and smoother digital access for riders across the emirate.The two fleets will appear together on Bolt (the global e-hailing partner DTC has been integrating with) and Zed (the UAE’s homegrown ride-hailing app tied to Al Ghurair). That means when users open either app they should see a much larger pool of nearby taxis. Any new taxis added to either operator will be automatically incorporated into the integrated platform network, so the pool grows without extra manual steps.DTC’s leadership framed the move as a way to “embed taxis more deeply into the digital ride-hailing experience,” while Kabi’s management called the alliance a “pivotal step” in raising service efficiency across the city.Dubai Taxi Company (DTC) is one of the emirate’s most recognisable brands, operating more than 6,200 taxis under the Roads & Transport Authority’s (RTA) umbrella. Over the years, DTC has been steadily pushing into the digital space, integrating its fleet with e-hailing apps like Bolt and upgrading vehicles with cashless payments, smart meters, and eco-friendly models as part of Dubai’s sustainability targets.On the other side is Kabi, the new face of what was once known as Cars Taxi, now rebranded under the Al Ghurair group. With around 3,680 vehicles, Kabi has been refreshing its operations and brand identity to match Dubai’s modern mobility landscape. Its partnership with the local e-hailing app Zed is a big part of that push, giving the company a more tech-forward edge.For residents and visitors alike, the change is something you’ll feel in everyday life. If you’re part of the nightlife crowd, you won’t need to chase taxis outside City Walk or JBR at midnight, the car will come straight to you with a quick tap. Families benefit too, with bigger taxis and digital payment options now easier to secure through the apps. Tourists arriving during Dubai’s busy peak season will find the experience closer to Uber-level convenience but with the reliability of regulated local services. And for everyday commuters caught in the rush-hour crunch, the expanded fleet means less waiting, fewer booking failures, and more peace of mind. In short, this deal is Dubai’s way of saying:","Dubai taxi company (dtc) and kabi by al ghurair have signed a strategic alliance to integrate their fleets onto major e-hailing platforms. That’s 6,200 from dtc plus 3,680 from kabi for a combined 9,880-vehicle network.

Arc’teryx and Cai Guo-Qiang respond to the controversy

Public backlash and media scrutiny





A recent fireworks display in the Himalayas by renowned artist Cai Guo-Qiang, in collaboration with Canadian outdoor brand Arc’teryx, has sparked widespread criticism from climate activists and social media users. The display, titled “Rising Dragon,” took place on a Tibetan plateau at an altitude of approximately 5,500 meters in Shigatse. Videos of the colourful pyrotechnics quickly circulated online, drawing ire from environmentalists who argued that the stunt disregarded the fragile Himalayan ecosystem. In response, Arc’teryx and Cai Guo-Qiang issued public apologies, while authorities launched an investigation into the ecological impact and regulatory approval of the event.The “Rising Dragon” fireworks display was a collaboration between Cai Guo-Qiang, the acclaimed artist behind the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games pyrotechnics, and Arc’teryx, a Canadian outdoor apparel brand now owned by Chinese sports giant Anta Sports. The event, staged at a high-altitude Tibetan plateau, was intended as a visually striking artistic and marketing spectacle, symbolizing creativity and brand presence in remote and dramatic landscapes.Videos released online showed vibrant, multicolored fireworks forming a winding dragon across the mountain peaks. While designed to captivate audiences and highlight Arc’teryx’s adventurous brand ethos, the display quickly ignited environmental concerns, given the region’s fragile ecosystem and its sensitivity to human activity.Following mounting criticism, Arc’teryx apologised on social media, acknowledging that the event contradicted its commitment to outdoor conservation and responsible practices. The brand announced it would invite a third-party environmental organization to assess any ecological damage and implement corrective measures, emphasizing transparency and accountability in its future projects.Cai Guo-Qiang, known for his elaborate gunpowder artworks and pyrotechnics, issued a public apology on Chinese social media, admitting that several environmental considerations were overlooked. He expressed regret and vowed to cooperate fully with authorities’ investigation while committing to implement stricter safety and environmental measures in future projects.Despite issuing formal apologies, Arc’teryx and artist Cai Guo-Qiang continued to face sharp criticism from both the public and the media. Chinese state outlets, including the Global Times, scrutinized the brand for inconsistencies in its statements across different platforms, highlighting a perceived gap between its commitment to environmental responsibility and the actual execution of the fireworks display. Social media users on Weibo and Douyin called for accountability, not only from the brand and the artist but also from local officials who approved the event, arguing that there should be consequences for actions that risk damaging sensitive ecosystems.Environmentalists emphasized that the Himalayas, home to fragile flora and fauna and crucial water sources, are particularly vulnerable to human interference. Many commentators framed the display as a case study in the tension between corporate marketing ambitions and environmental stewardship, questioning whether extreme artistic stunts should ever be conducted in protected or remote natural areas. The debate extended beyond China, with global audiences engaging on platforms like Instagram and Twitter, reflecting a growing international awareness of the environmental responsibilities brands hold when executing high-visibility campaigns. As the backlash continues, many are calling for stricter global guidelines on artistic and marketing projects in ecologically sensitive regions. The controversy may also serve as a wake-up call for brands to prioritize sustainability over spectacle in future campaigns.","A recent fireworks display in the himalayas by renowned artist cai guo-qiang has sparked widespread criticism from climate activists and social media users.

The recent decision by US President Donald Trump to raise the H1B visa fee to $100,000 has sparked criticism from global education and policy experts. Yale University scholar Gautam Mukunda described the fee increase as “counterproductive” and warned that it could significantly harm America’s ability to attract highly skilled international talent.H1B visas have long been a strategic tool for the United States to bring in top engineers, scientists, and innovators from around the world. However, Mukunda emphasized that such policies risk turning the US into a less attractive destination for the world’s best minds. He specifically highlighted the exceptional value of Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) graduates, calling them a global asset that the US risks losing.Mukunda said. “This H1B visa decision makes no sense at all.”IITs are globally recognized for producing engineers and innovators with high technical skills and problem-solving capabilities. These graduates have historically contributed to the growth of US tech companies, startups, and research institutions.By making it prohibitively expensive for foreign talent to work in the US, the country risks losing this strategic advantage.Mukunda’s criticism underscores a broader concern: in a knowledge-driven economy, the cost of restricting talent mobility far outweighs short-term financial gains from visa fees. Countries that embrace global talent continue to see growth in technology, entrepreneurship, and innovation—areas where the US has traditionally excelled.Amid concerns over the US visa policy, India’s Union Minister for Commerce and Industry, Piyush Goyal, emphasised the country’s ongoing contribution to global talent and innovation. Speaking at the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum, Goyal highlighted India’s ability to provide skilled engineers, graduates, and innovative solutions for companies worldwide, including those in the United States as reported.“We provide a huge pool of skilled engineers and graduates who are internationally recognized for their talent and innovation,” Goyal said. “Indian professionals help global corporations focus on research, development, and new ideas, enabling growth and competitiveness.”India is not only contributing skilled professionals but is also fostering a vibrant startup ecosystem. Many Indian startups are developing innovative solutions that go beyond traditional resources, driving global entrepreneurship. Goyal noted that this ecosystem reflects Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s vision, which he championed since 2010 during his tenure as Chief Minister of Gujarat.The growth of startups in India has positioned the country as a hub for technology, innovation, and global business solutions, providing significant opportunities for collaboration with international corporations.Beyond talent and startups, India is emerging as a major player in clean energy development. Goyal highlighted that the country has the potential to expand its renewable energy capacity significantly over the next five years, creating opportunities for global partnerships and sustainable development.India’s expertise in clean energy, combined with its engineering and technological talent, allows it to contribute solutions that address global challenges, even as countries like the US adopt policies that may limit access to such talent. Experts like Mukunda warn that the $100,000 H1B fee hike could have unintended consequences for the US economy. By discouraging top-tier professionals from moving to the US, the country risks losing its edge in technology, research, and innovation.High-skilled international talent has historically been central to America’s technological leadership. Decisions that make it harder for such talent to work in the US could result in a long-term loss of innovation, economic growth, and competitiveness in the global market.","The recent decision by us president donald trump to raise the h1b visa fee to $100,000 has sparked criticism from global education and policy experts.

H-1B Crackdown! Trump Imposes $100k Fee; Indians & Tech Giants Face Major Hit; Know All About It

H-1B Visas: Wall Street Banks May Increase India Talent Dependence





US President Donald Trump ’s move to steeply hike the H-1B visa fees to $100,000 in a bid to create more jobs for Americans may actually end up backfiring! Major Wall Street banks are actually expected to increase their dependence on business support centres in India after Trump’s fee hike for new H-1B visa applications.Despite Trump's intention to safeguard American employment through immigration restrictions, analysts suggest these new regulations might encourage banks to strengthen their presence in Indian technology centres like Mumbai, Bengaluru and Hyderabad, which currently provide employment to over 1.9 million individuals.H-1B visas, extensively utilised by technology sectors in India and the US for skilled foreign workers, also see significant usage from financial and consulting organisations. During the US fiscal year ending September 2023, Indian nationals constituted 72.3% of total H-1B recipients, which includes both new and renewed employment.Also Read | The $100,000 H-1B gamble: Why Donald Trump’s visa tax won’t save American jobs - winners and losers According to a Bloomberg report, leading American banks, including Citigroup Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., are significant employers at India's global capability centres, which handle various functions from trading assistance and risk assessment to technical support.These centres, employing software engineers, quantitative analysts and accounting professionals, provide cost-effective services whilst offering access to qualified professionals who are scarce in their domestic markets.US banks maintain substantial presence in this sector, enabling potential work relocation to India to navigate new visa regulations. The workforce numbers are significant: Citigroup maintains 33,000 personnel in India, Bank of America Corp. employs over 27,000, whilst JPMorgan has 10,000 staff.""Unless new restrictions are placed on offshoring, foreign banks will lean even more on their Indian capability centers,"" Umesh Chhazzed, founder of recruitment firm Anlage Infotech, who has worked with US lenders for more than two decades was quoted as saying in the Bloomberg report.According to EY data quoted in the report, Global Capability Centres have evolved into a $64 billion industry, showing 9.8% annual growth from 2019 to 2024. These centres are expected to increase from the current 1,700 to approximately 2,500 by 2030, with projected market value reaching $110 billion.""Banks would be calibrating a new strategy for the global capability centers. It appears, there will be onshoring of jobs to India adding new job functions,"" said Abizer Diwanji, founder of NeoStart Advisors LLP, a financial advisory firm. ""However, none will jump the gun amid evolving situations. They will wait for more clarity,” he was quoted as saying.Also Read | Alternatives to H-1B visas: After fee hike by Trump to $100,000, O1 & L1 visas gain traction; check cost, approval rates Research published in the Management Science journal indicates that companies typically respond to skilled immigration restrictions by increasing overseas recruitment.

MUMBAI: GST reforms, coupled with a five-quarter high GDP growth, have positioned the Indian economy for a sustained period of expansion, RBI ’s ‘State of the Economy’ report released on Wednesday showed. The report presents an optimistic outlook for second half (H2) of the fiscal year, suggesting that robust domestic drivers are set to overcome global uncertainties, including new US trade tariffs.According to the report, the stage is set for sustained pick up in consumption demand in H2, and potentially for a virtuous cycle of higher investment and stronger growth impulses, overcoming persistent global uncertainties. The drivers for this virtuous cycle are the ‘robust’ pass through of the 100 basis point rate cut between February and August. This, coupled with cut in income tax and simplification of GST are expected to revive growth impulses.The report highlights that the recently-implemented GST reforms are a key catalyst for future growth. “The landmark GST reforms should progressively result in a sustained positive impact through significant gains in ease of doing business, lower retail prices and strengthening of consumption growth drivers”.This aligns with the report’s overall positive projections for the coming months.According to the report, the Indian economy’s current strength is fundamentally domestic. In Q1 2025-26, the economy achieved a five-quarter high in growth, propelled by strong consumption and fixed investment. The report notes a remarkable resilience in domestic demand, with rural consumption remaining robust and a broad-based expansion across sectors. The manufacturing and services sectors, in particular, saw significant growth, with their respective PMIs reaching an 18-year and a decade high. Going ahead, favourable monsoon conditions and robust kharif sowing are expected to support the agriculture sector and help contain food prices.Despite this internal strength, the report acknowledges significant external risks. “Global uncertainty remained elevated in the wake of imposition of US trade tariffs on major trading partners and renewed concerns over fiscal health of advanced economies”. The imposition of a 50% US import tariff on Indian exports led to a temporary decline in equity markets and contributed to a depreciation of the Indian rupee against the US dollar. However, robust domestic institutional buying successfully offset foreign portfolio investor outflows, showcasing the economy’s ability to absorb external shocks.","Gst reforms, coupled with a five-quarter high gdp growth, have positioned the indian economy for a sustained period of expansion.
