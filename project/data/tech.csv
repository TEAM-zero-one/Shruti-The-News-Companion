Sam Altman just dropped a big AI prediction for 2026; experts are skeptical,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sam-altman-just-dropped-a-big-ai-prediction-for-2026-experts-are-skeptical/articleshow/121811592.cms,"Sam Altman AI prediction for 2026

What Sam Altman really said: AI with ""novel insights"" by 2026

""By 2026, we will likely see the arrival of systems that can figure out novel insights,""

What does ""novel insight"" really mean

An AI race for survival: Other technology giants are not lagging behind

Google DeepMind just released a paper on AlphaEvolve, a coding AI agent that created innovative solutions to challenging math problems, something even accomplished researchers hadn't tried.

Anthropic founder of Claude AI, established a research grant program in May 2025 to support research projects that employ AI to generate scientific hypotheses and conduct experiments.

FutureHouse, founded by ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt, states its AI assisted in an actual scientific breakthrough, though details are kept under wraps.

Lila Sciences, a startup by now-former OpenAI researcher Kenneth Stanley, has raised $200 million to create a lab dedicated to teaching AI models to ask more intelligent scientific questions, a basic prerequisite for insight.

Why 'novel insights' from AI might still be useless, experts say

In a fresh thought-provoking article entitled ""The Gentle Singularity,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has again moved in with a daring prediction: by 2026, artificial intelligence systems will be able to make ""novel insights."" The claim may sound ambiguous in itself, yet in the context of the developing objectives of OpenAI and the wider competitive scene of AI research, it weighs. Altman, who is famous for his futurist vision and bold declarations regarding artificial general intelligence (AGI), presents this forecast as part of an extended evolution of human society, one where AI remakes work, energy, innovation, and even scientific breakthroughs.His essay, released June 10, 2025, is more than prediction; it can be used as an unofficial guide for where OpenAI and its competitors are going next. This race towards AI systems coming up with genuine, new ideas instead of merely recombining present information is becoming the next arms race in technology innovation. With major breakthroughs being achieved by Google DeepMind, Anthropic, and upstart companies such as Lila Sciences and FutureHouse, the stakes are high not just for corporate hegemony but for the future of science itself.Altman's essay describes his vision for the ""gentle singularity,"" an era in which AGI does not destroy or dismantle civilization but rather becomes a productive, evolutionary partner to humans. Perhaps one of the most remarkable things he predicts is this:This matter-of-fact-sounding sentence has huge implications. First of all, it indicates that OpenAI is approaching a level of model capability where artificial intelligence can move past summarization, prediction, or pattern matching and start to think creatively. This is the distinction between an AI that simply reports data and one that adds meaningfully to human knowledge.OpenAI President and co-founder Greg Brockman has recently supported this concept when announcing the o3 and o4-mini models in April 2025. ""These were the first models scientists used to create useful new ideas in their field,"" he declared, suggesting that OpenAI is already developing the kind of AI that Altman described in his essay.The ""novel insight"" in AI is the capability of the AI model to generate new, valuable, and hitherto not thought-provoking ideas or hypotheses. This characteristic stretches much beyond the current realm of capabilities of AI chatbots and big language models that are based on spewing out known facts.Altman's prophetic essay is not isolated. Over the past few months, a host of major players have taken strategic actions in line with the premise of ""novel insight"" creation:Even as the hype sets in, top AI minds remain hesitant. Hugging Face Chief Science Officer Thomas Wolf recently contended that existing models can't pose genuinely new questions, a precondition for any scientific breakthrough. Likewise, Kenneth Stanley himself concedes that the issue is ""fundamentally difficult,"" not merely a matter of computational horsepower but modeling what humans find ""interesting"" or ""meaningful.""Creativity is not just computation, but intuition and judgment areas where AI still lags. This means that even if models can generate new hypotheses, it remains unclear how useful, testable, or correct these insights will be.","Openai ceo sam altman predicts that by 2026, artificial intelligence systems will be able to make ""novel insights"" race towards ai systems coming up with genuine, new ideas is becoming the next arms race in technology innovation.

Steve Jobs was brilliant but don’t copy this 'one habit' of him; warns Pixar's Pete Docter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/steve-jobs-was-brilliant-but-dont-copy-this-one-habit-of-him-warns-pixars-pete-docter/articleshow/121851338.cms,"Steve Jobs was brilliant but don’t copy this 'one habit' of him; warns Pixar's Pete Docter

Why Steve Jobs told Pixar, “This Is Not My Business” - and meant it



Decoding genius: Steve Jobs' ability to distill complexity

Steve Jobs called at 3 AM - Pete Docter says that’s ‘one habit’ you shouldn’t copy



Behind the scenes: Pixar's quiet rise to the top

Leadership lessons for today's visionaries

When Steve Jobs bought Pixar from George Lucas in 1986 for $10 million, few could have imagined the impact this would have - both on animation, but ultimately on the future of creative entrepreneurship. Pixar was then a struggling graphics division with limited numbers and grand aspirations. Jobs’ decision was widely considered risky, especially since the company had yet to prove itself as a viable business in the entertainment space. But what unfolded over the next two decades transformed not only the fate of Pixar, but also Jobs’ legacy beyond Apple Fast forward to 2025, and Pixar is one of the world's most legendary animation houses, with a catalog of Oscar winners and a reputation for storytelling greatness. A lot of that, Chief Creative Officer Pete Docter says, had to do with Jobs' none-too-hands-on approach to creative choices but rather with his skill at stepping back. Speaking at the Fast Company Most Innovative Companies Summit, Docter drew from Jobs' distinctive style of leadership, offering never-before-heard perspectives that highlight how restraint, emotional intelligence, and prioritisation guided Pixar's path.Though he was the executive producer and economic lifeline of Pixar, Steve Jobs never attempted to influence the storytelling direction of the studio. Pete Docter, the company's third animator who is now the brains behind movies such as Up and Inside Out, noted that Jobs kept out of his way. ""Steve was really good at saying, 'This is not my business,'"" Docter recalled.This amount of creative trust is not to be found, particularly from a person who's been stereotyped as a micromanager in his early days at Apple. Yet Jobs at Pixar seemed to know that good storytelling took room. He funded the humans, the technology, and the buildings but he never attempted to ""direct the director."" Rather, he listened. He provided counsel when required. He entered not as a general, but as a partner.This methodology enabled Pixar's artists to experiment freely. It created the foundation for the studio's unprecedented success, beginning with Toy Story in 1995, the first computer-animated full-length feature film, and followed up with Finding Nemo, Ratatouille, Up, Inside Out, and Soul.Jobs wasn't only hands-off, he was laser-sharp when it counted. Jobs, Docter said, had a talent for entering into a complicated conversation and, in a matter of minutes, being able to identify the root of the issue. ""He could sit for about five minutes and review what the conversation was actually about,"" Docter said. ""That's not something anyone's born with. It was the result of years of practice.This ability, cutting through noise to locate the signal is what made Jobs such a good strategist, even beyond his comfort zone. Whether it was a meeting regarding server capacity, distribution logistics, or creative tone, Jobs was able to immediately grasp the crux of the problem and challenge his team to crack it.This ability wasn’t just intellectual, it was emotional. Jobs was able to read the currents in a room, detect underlying tensions, and gently move individuals toward understanding. In a time when numerous leaders are concerned with establishing dominance, Jobs' strength resided in his ability to see what truly counted and to pose the proper questions rather than provide all the solutions.But even visionaries are not perfect and Docter wasn't afraid to call them out. One of Jobs' most infamous tendencies was his lack of respect for boundaries. “He would call — especially the producers — at any time, day or night, 3 in the morning, you’re on vacation, doesn’t matter,” Docter revealed. “He wants to talk to you about it, you’re on.”This intensity, while sometimes idealized, also produced burnout and stress. Jobs' all-consuming urgency was galvanizing but draining. Docter conceded that he's tried not to inherit that specific habit, although he occasionally sends late-night emails himself too. “That’s what my wife is trying to get me to stop doing,” he joked.This story is a cautionary tale: even the greatest leaders need to discover where to set limits. Passion is great but boundaries allow for long-term success.While Pixar's meteoric ascendancy is invariably linked with technical ingenuity and storytelling brilliance, its organizational culture also played a pivotal role. Jobs permitted the studio to forge its own identity even when Disney acquired Pixar for $7.4 billion in 2006, rendering him the largest Disney shareholder at the time.Former Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger once said he expected Jobs to be tough. But instead, he found him to be open-minded and reflective. “Who wouldn’t want Steve Jobs to have influence over how a company is run?” Iger told Vanity Fair in an interview.Jobs' commitment to explaining things until they made sense, not mandating decisions by hierarchy, served to maintain Pixar's creative DNA even within the gigantic edifice of Disney. He did not care to win arguments. He craved alignment and that made him an unusual executive in Silicon Valley and Hollywood.In the modern world of high-pressure startups, midnight Slack messages, and always-on culture, Docter’s reflections offer a timely reminder: the most effective leaders are those who listen more than they talk. Jobs' legacy at Pixar wasn’t about control, it was about clarity.His genius wasn’t just in innovation, but in emotional strategy. He could read rooms, empower people, and know when to step back. Yet, his occasional lack of boundaries reminds current leaders that brilliance without empathy can cost relationships and morale.Pete Docter takes Pixar's helm with a more measured hand these days, blending Jobs' wisdom with his own sense of how creative individuals work best. As Pixar keeps pushing the boundaries of great storytelling, its core continues to be based on the culture Jobs helped foster - not by dictating it, but by believing in it.","Steve jobs was brilliant but don’t copy this 'one habit' of him; warns pixar's pete docter. Jobs was able to read the currents in a room, detect underlying tensions, and gently move individuals toward understanding.

In a significant overhaul of Indian railways' ticketing policy, the Ministry of Railways made it clear that from July 1, 2025, only Aadhaar-verified users will be entitled to reserve tickets under the Tatkal system through the IRCTC portal or mobile application. It is a key step towards stricter digital identity authentication to prevent misuse, bring in more transparency, and ensure the facility of emergency ticketing reaches legitimate passengers.In a sequel to this order, the ministry has also directed an extra OTP-based Aadhaar authentication layer from July 15, 2025, in order to further rationalise the process. The Indian Railways' move, as conveyed to all zonal railway divisions on June 10, 2025, is in light of increasing festival season demand and growing complaints of manipulation of bookings by agents. Here is the entire explanation of the new regulations, implementation schedule, agent restrictions, and booking practical tips all passengers must be aware of.From July 1, Tatkal tickets could only be booked by passengers who have done Aadhaar authentication on IRCTC's website and mobile app.From July 15, 2025, even authenticated users will have to undergo a one-time password (OTP) authentication process associated with their Aadhaar number during every Tatkal booking.With a view to minimizing bulk bookings and ensuring level playing ground for the public:These restrictions will be applied on all zones and directions have been issued to both CRIS (Centre for Railway Information Systems) and IRCTC to enforce these steps by modifying back-end systems and user interfaces.The Railway Ministry has made it clear that the aim is to:The new policy essentially transforms the manner in which emergency train tickets will be secured in India. While Aadhaar verification maximizes transparency and equity, it might also present challenges for those who have not linked their ID with IRCTC or those who are not technologically savvy.

Nothing to prove. Everything to do.

My energy arrives before I do.

Never shrink to fit small minds.

Know your worth—then add tax.

I back myself—that’s the power.

No approval needed.

Comfortable in flaws. Sharp in focus.

Not perfect—just powerful.

I don’t follow. I lead in silence.

Calm under chaos.

I built the game I play.

Quiet wins loud.

I’m the blueprint, not the replica.

I show up different.

My lane. No traffic.

Courage is presence, not noise.

I create standards—not seek them.

No boasts. Just build.

Walk like you’ve won.

I dominate—not compete.

Better than I was—not than others.

Knowing myself is enough.

Steady mind. Heavy grind.

I redefine average.

Cool head. Hot ambition.

Unshaken, not loud.

My walk holds the power.

Rare is my real.

I choose—never chase.

Aligned, not arrogant.

I’m not made to blend.

I walk in like I belong.

Silent steps. Solid path.

Self-belief is my habit.

I make moves—not announcements.

My glow doesn’t scream.

I am my only competition.

Results. No hype.

I believe in me—that’s the edge.

My silence roars success.

Real confidence stays the same.

I stand alone—because I can.

Calm outside. Storm inside.

Natural confidence is king.

My worth doesn’t need proof.

I am the moment.

Certainty leads. Humility follows.

When you're sure, they notice.

Android 16 IS HERE! Live Notifications, Tablet Desktop Mode & MORE!

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that the next decade will be the era of autonomous driving cars, robots and autonomous machines. In an interview with CNBC’s Arjun Kharpal Thursday at the Viva Tech conference in Paris, Huang said “This is going to be the decade of AV [autonomous vehicles], robotics, autonomous machines.”Nvidia is playing an important role in the rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs), supplying both hardware and software to support their development. The US chip giant is a key enabler behind the growing fleet of self-driving cars , especially in the U.S., where Waymo — owned by Google — operates robotaxi services in cities like San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles.China has also seen growing adoption, with companies like Baidu and Pony.ai running their own robotaxi networks.Recently, Huang attended the London Tech Week where he said that AI is a “great equalizer” as it enables anyone to program using everyday language. Admitting that computing was hard historically, he said “We had to learn programming languages. We had to architect it. We had to design these computers that are very complicated”. “Now, all of a sudden ... there’s a new programming language. This new programming language is called ‘human,’” he added. ""Most people don't know C++, very few people know Python, and everybody, as you know, knows human.”He continued: “The way you program a computer today, to ask the computer to do something for you, even write a program, generate images, write a poem — just ask it nicely.”“And the thing that’s really, really quite amazing is the way you program an AI is like the way you program a person.”Explaining further, Huang gave an example saying, “You say, 'You are an incredible poet. You are deeply steeped in Shakespeare, and I would like you to write a poem to describe today's keynote.' Without very much effort, this AI would help you generate such a wonderful poem.”","N nvidia ceo jensen huang said the next decade will be the era of autonomous driving cars, robots and autonomous machines.

HOME: Where I can look ugly and enjoy it.

Today morning when I was driving my Ferrari, the alarm woke me up.

Dear Math, please grow up and solve your problems. I'm tired of answering them for you.

Normal is boring.

I need Google in my brain.

I like to hang out with people that make me forget to look at my phone.

I've found the recipe for happiness. Can someone just send me some money so that I can buy the ingredients?

I love food and sleep. If I give you a bit of food or text you all night, that means something.

Be your own kind of beautiful

Unlike protons I don’t deal with negativity

ME my room music internet connection no study a perfect day

If u can’t do great things then do small and simple things in a great way

Real beauty is to be true to oneself that’s what makes me feel good

Be yourself everyone else is already taken

I don’t have an attitude problem you have a perception problem

Work hard in silence let your success be your noise

Dream without fear love without limits

Keep calm and let karma finish it

I’m not a player I’m the game

Don’t tell people your dreams show them

Success is the best revenge for anything

I’m not special I’m just a limited edition

Be so good they can’t ignore you

I may be wrong but I doubt it

Turn your wounds into wisdom

Live life to the fullest and focus on the positive

Be a voice not an echo

Keep your heels head and standards high

My life my rules my attitude

Make today so awesome that yesterday gets jealous

Life is short make every hair flip fabulous

Be your own kind of beautiful

The best things in life are free The second best are very expensive

Confidence is not they will like me Confidence is I’ll be fine if they don’t

Collect moments not things

You are enough just as you are

Find yourself and be that

Don’t be a prisoner of your past Become the architect of your future

Choose people who choose you

Be fearless in pursuing what sets your soul on fire

Elegance is when the inside is as beautiful as the outside

Don’t stop until you’re proud

I am not a product of my circumstances I am a product of my decisions

Stay real stay loyal or stay away from me

Life is too short to be serious all the time So if you cant laugh at yourself call me Ill laugh at you

Chase your dreams but always know the road that will lead you home again

Be yourself everyone else is already taken

I don't have an attitude problem you have a perception problem

Work hard in silence let your success be your noise

Dream without fear love without limits

Motivational WhatsApp captions



What you lack in talent can be made up with desire, hustle, and giving 110% all the time.

Do what you can with all you have, wherever you are.

Develop an attitude of gratitude. Say thank you to everyone you meet for everything they do for you.

You are never too old to set another goal or dream a new one.

To see what is right and not do it is a lack of courage.

Reading is to the mind as exercise is to the body.

Fake it until you make it. Act as if you had all the required confidence until it becomes your reality.

The future belongs to the competent. Get good, get better, be the best.

For every reason it’s not possible, there are hundreds of people who have faced the same circumstances and succeeded.

Be a fountain, not a drain.

Great things never come from comfort zones.

Life is a journey, not a destination.

Life always offers you a second chance. It’s called tomorrow.

Every new day is another chance to change your life.

Having a soft heart in a cruel world is courage, not weakness.

Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience.

Prove yourself to yourself, not to others.

Work for a cause, not applause. Live life to express, not to impress.

When you can’t change the direction of the wind, adjust your sails.

Why fit in if you’re born to stand out?

Don’t take kindness as a sign of weakness.

Minds are like parachutes — they only function when open.

Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.

Success doesn’t come to you, you go to it.

Hustle in silence, let your results make the noise.

Every day is a fresh start – make it count.

Dream big. Work hard. Stay focused.

Rise above the storm and you’ll find the sunshine.

The grind never lies.

Your only limit is your mindset.

Make it happen. Shock everyone.

Progress over perfection, always.

Don’t wait for an opportunity. Create it.

Fuel your hustle with passion.

You weren’t born to be average.

Prove them wrong – every single day.

Stay hungry, stay humble.

Keep going – your future self will thank you.

Build a life you don’t need a vacation from.

The best views come after the hardest climbs.

If you can dream it, you can do it.

This year is yours – take the shot.

Emotional WhatsApp captions



I wish I could turn back time and make everything right

The saddest thing is feeling alone in a crowd

I’m drowning in memories and there’s no way out

Every heart has a pain only the way of expressing it is different

The hardest part is pretending to be happy

Some days I just want to disappear

It’s hard to find happiness when you feel like nothing

The silence after an argument is the loudest sound

It hurts when you realize you aren’t as important to someone as you thought

Saying goodbye to the one you love is like saying goodbye to your own happiness

Sometimes you have to pretend everything is fine when it’s not

I’m not okay but I’ll pretend to be

Behind every strong person is a story that left them broken

Loving you was my favorite mistake

It’s hard to forget someone who was your entire life

I miss the old us

You left without a goodbye and now I’m left with the pieces

I wish I could stop loving you but my heart refuses to listen

Sometimes the people who are thousands of miles away from you can make you feel better than the ones right beside you

I thought I mattered but I was wrong

I’m tired of fighting for a love that’s already gone

The scars you can’t see are the hardest to heal

Tears speak when the heart can't

Smiling outside, breaking inside

Sometimes silence is the loudest cry

I’m tired of pretending I’m fine

Lost in a world that doesn’t see me

It hurts, but I’ll deal with it

The worst pain is being forgotten

I miss the old me

We were perfect… until we weren’t

Crying isn’t a weakness, it’s a release

The hardest part is acting like it’s okay

Some scars never show, but they’re the deepest

Loved too much, lost too hard

Trust once broken is hard to rebuild

Happiness left and didn’t say goodbye

I’m okay… just tired of everything

When memories hurt more than they heal

Faking smiles is an exhausting job

Some wounds time doesn't heal

I'm not mad, just disappointed

Hope hurts more than letting go

People change, promises break

Missing you is a daily struggle

I wish feelings had an off switch

Loneliness feels louder at night

We said forever, but forever ended early

No more expectations, no more pain

Too broken to be fixed

Love left, emptiness stayed

Heart full of words never said

Simplicity is the keynote of true life

Life is short smile while you still have teeth

The purpose of life is to believe to hope and to strive

Life is about making an impact not making an income

Life is straightforward but we insist on complicating it

Life is a journey that must be traveled no matter how bad the roads and accommodations

Life is like riding a bicycle To keep your balance you must keep moving

Life is 10 percent what happens to us and 90 percent how we react to it

What top tech CEOs say

India’s New AC Rule: Cooling Between 20°C–28°C Explained

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has raised concerns that it could take away jobs, especially entry-level roles. But Reid Hoffman , co-founder of LinkedIn believes that young people should not fear AI. Instead, they should use it to their advantage while job hunting. In a video he published on his YouTube channel this week, Hoffman said “""You are generation AI. You are AI native. So bringing the fact that you have AI in your tool set is one of the things that makes you enormously attractive”.Reid Hoffman was responding to questions from college students, many of whom were worried about their job prospects in the AI age. He admitted those fears are valid, but encouraged students to flip the script.“Yes, it’s changing the workplace and creating confusion for employers,” he said. “But it also gives you a chance to show your unique abilities. In teams with older professionals, you might even be the one helping them understand new tools,” Hoffman stated.Dario Amodei, CEO of AI company Anthropic, recently warned that AI could eliminate up to half of all entry-level office jobs in the next five years. He said this could cause unemployment to rise by 10% to 20%, and added, “Most people don’t realize this is about to happen.”But top tech figures like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and investor Mark Cuban strongly disagreed with Amodei’s view. Speaking at VivaTech 2025, Huang said: “I pretty much disagree with almost everything he says. AI will definitely change jobs — it changed mine — but it will also create new ones.”Cuban echoed the same sentiment in a recent social media post, pointing out that even in the past, roles like secretaries and in-office dictation staff were replaced by technology, but new industries and jobs emerged.“AI will lead to new companies and increase total employment,” he wrote.","Linkedin co-founder reid hoffman believes young people should not fear ai.

New vehicles and gameplay enhancements



Rockstar Games has officially announced ""Money Fronts,"" the next major update for Grand Theft Auto Online, set to arrive on June 17, 2025. The update introduces a sophisticated layer to the criminal underworld of San Andreas, allowing players to establish seemingly legitimate businesses as covers for their illicit activities, reminiscent of the popular series Breaking Bad. At the heart of the ""Money Fronts"" update is the ability for players to acquire and manage a range of storefronts that operate as fronts for money laundering. The entry point into this new venture is the iconic Hands On Car Wash in Strawberry.At the core of the update is the Hands On Car Wash, a low-profile but cash-intensive business that allows players to launder dirty money. With support from Martin Madrazo, players will connect with new advisors who help them manage operations, unlock additional fronts, and expand their laundering empire.Players will be able to expand their legitimate portfolio to include other businesses like the ""Smoke on the Water"" dispensary and ""Higgins Helitours."" These additional fronts will not only help launder ill-gotten gains but also boost the earnings from existing criminal enterprises, such as weed farms and air freight cargo.Owning the car wash will also provide access to other businesses, including the Smoke on the Water dispensary and Higgins Helitours, which enhance earnings from Weed Farms and Air Freight Cargo networks.Illegal activities tied to these operations will generate Heat, attracting unwanted attention.

Mark Cuban faces users backlash, asked to ...

Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban has publicly criticized Bluesky , the decentralized social media platform he once championed, for becoming “ruder and more hateful,” according to a report by the New York Post. Cuban, known for his tech ventures and former ownership of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, warned that the platform’s lack of diverse perspectives is driving users back to Elon Musk ’s X, formerly Twitter.Cuban, who joined Bluesky in late 2024 with an optimistic post -— “Hello Less Hateful World” -- now says the platform has devolved into a hostile echo chamber. “The lack of diversity of thought here is really hurting usage,” he wrote in a series of posts this week, as quoted by the Post. He noted that the platform’s predominantly left-leaning user base often meets dissenting or nuanced opinions with outrage, stifling meaningful discussion. “Engagement went from great convos on many topics, to agree with me or you are a nazi fascist,” Cuban added.The Post reports that Cuban, who supported Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election but did not donate to her campaign, shared a Washington Post opinion piece by Megan McArdle, which argued that Bluesky’s left-leaning user base fosters a political silo. Cuban endorsed the piece, urging users to use the platform’s moderation tools to block rather than attack those they disagree with. “The moderation and block tools on here are so advanced, if you see someone you don’t want to see on here, just block them. Don’t attack them,” he wrote.However, Cuban’s critiques sparked backlash from some Bluesky users , the Post noted. Responses included profane attacks, with one user writing, “Go wipe your crocodile tears with a wad of hundreds you tw-t,” and another stating, “F–kin leave then, p—y.” A third user, whose post Cuban reposted, called him a “despicable bastard” and told him to “just Go Away.”The report highlighted Bluesky’s rapid growth, noting that its user base tripled from 10 million to over 30 million between November 2024 and May 2025, according to Pew Research Center. This surge followed Elon Musk’s endorsement of Donald Trump’s reelection campaign, which prompted many liberal-leaning users to leave X for Bluesky. Yet, Cuban’s recent comments suggest the platform’s ideological slant may now be pushing users back to Twitter.Cuban, whose net worth is approximately $8.35 billion per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, lamented that even minor disagreements on Bluesky often escalate into hostility. “Even if you agree with 95% of what a person is saying on a topic, if there is one point that you might call out as being more of a grey area, they will call you a fascist etc.,” he wrote, per the Post.",Mark cuban slams bluesky for becoming hostile echo chamber.

GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke warned startup founders at VivaTech in Paris that while AI coding assistants can help launch companies, scaling them requires human developers and technical expertise . Speaking at Station F startup campus , Dohmke said bootstrapped startups built predominantly with AI coding tools ""doesn't have much value"" to investors and would struggle to justify funding rounds without complex systems built by skilled developers.The Microsoft-owned platform's CEO explained that non-technical founders increasingly use "" vibe coding ,"" natural language prompts that generate code, to build products with small teams and minimal funding. However, this approach creates a crowded market where investors question why they should choose one AI-built startup over another. ""The investors would ask, 'Why would I invest in you instead of the 10 other people?'"" Dohmke said, emphasizing that startups need deeper understanding of their systems to attract serious investment.Dohmke observed a dramatic shift in AI adoption over the past two years, from companies needing convincing to widespread ""FOMO"" in the market. While AI tools have democratized startup creation, he stressed that successful scaling requires developers who can build sophisticated systems. ""A non-technical founder will find it difficult to build a startup at scale without developers because they can't build a complex system to justify the next round,"" he explained.The GitHub CEO, whose platform serves over 150 million users worldwide, acknowledged the excitement around AI-driven engineering but maintained that coding skills remain essential. He previously stated that ""every kid, every child, should learn coding"" because knowing when to rely on personal coding abilities versus AI assistance is crucial. Dohmke emphasized that software engineers need ""willingness to learn"" about AI prompts while understanding when not to use them, noting that using prompts for tasks you can already do yourself ""is a waste of time.""","Github ceo thomas dohmke warned startup founders at vivatech in paris that while ai coding assistants can help launch companies, scaling them requires human developers and technical expertise.

While the gap up presents immediate profit opportunities, seasoned traders are positioning for strategic buy-on-dips entries.The ₹99,000 level, coinciding with the 21-day EMA, represents the most logical support zone for dip buying in this new bullish environment. This level offers multiple confluence factors:1. EMA 21 Support: The 21-period moving average at ₹99,000 provides dynamic support2. Psychological Level: Round number support with strong psychological significance3. Gap Fill Protection: Sufficient distance from gap opening to avoid immediate fill4.
