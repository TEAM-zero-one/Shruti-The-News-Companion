Restaurants can’t enforce service charge: Delhi HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/restaurants-cant-enforce-service-charge-delhi-hc/articleshow/119676698.cms,"Service charge is nothing but a tip or voluntary contribution: HC

NEW DELHI: Terming it a “double whammy” for the customer and an unfair trade practice, Delhi high court on Friday upheld the Centre’s move to ban the mandatory levy of service charge by hotels and restaurants, ruling that such payment must be discretionary.“Service charge or tip, as it is colloquially referred to, is a voluntary payment by the customer. It cannot be compulsory or mandatory. The practice undertaken by the restaurant establishments of collecting service charge, that too on a mandatory basis, in a coercive manner, would be contrary to consumer interest and is violative of consumer rights,” Justice Prathiba M Singh observed in a landmark pro-consumer ruling.The court said “service charge is being arbitrarily collected and coercively enforced” while dismissing a batch of petitions filed by two restaurant associations challenging the Central Consumer Protection Authority’s guidelines.It also slapped a cost of Rs 1 lakh each on them, payable to the authority. The CCPA had issued the guidelines in July 2022 to prevent unfair trade practices and violation of consumer rights. Agreeing with the CCPA’s stand, the high court said the collection of service charge and the use of different terminologies for the said charge is misleading and deceptive in nature. “The same constitutes an unfair trade practice,” it noted.It underlined that restaurants “by mandatorily collecting service charge are in fact misleading the consumer about the actual price of products on the menu card. In fact, when a large number of food items are ordered, most consumers may not even notice levying of service charge, that too in small print, and may end up paying a much higher amount than what is chargeable. This constitutes an unfair trade practice.”The high court observed that the manner of enforcement of payment of service charge is “also coercive in nature” as it highlighted that often “service charge is being confused with service tax or a mandatory tax imposed by govt. In fact, for the consumers, the collection of service charge is proving to be a double whammy, i.e., they are forced to pay service tax and GST on the service charge as well. This position cannot be ignored by the court.”It said the “camouflaged and coercive manner in which service charge is being collected by the restaurant establishments itself shows the unlawful nature of the charge” and suggested the CCPA consider allowing a change of the term service charge, which is nothing but a ‘tip or a gratuity or a voluntary contribution’. The court emphasized that “mandatory levy of service charge"" is against public interest and imposes an additional financial burden on the customers.",Delhi high court upholds centre's move to ban mandatory levy of service charge by hotels and restaurants. The court said “service charge is being arbitrarily collected and coercively enforced’ it dismissed a batch of petitions filed by two restaurant associations challenging the central consumer protection authority’s guidelines.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119677175,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-495971,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Delhi Restaurant Service Charge: Restaurants can't force customers to pay service charge says Delhi HC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/service-charge-on-food-bills-voluntary-restaurants-cant-mandatorily-levy-delhi-hc/articleshow/119645688.cms,"Hotels and restaurants cannot automatically or by default add a service charge to food bills.

NEW DELHI: The Delhi high court on Friday adjudicated that the imposition of service charge by customers on food bills remained discretionary and establishments could not compel patrons to pay the same.Justice Prathiba M Singh delivered the verdict whilst dismissing petitions filed by restaurant associations challenging the Central Consumer Protection Authority's directives that barred hotels and restaurants from imposing obligatory service charges on food bills.The establishments had sought to invalidate the regulatory guidelines, which explicitly prohibited the mandatory collection of service charges from patrons.According to legal news portal Bar and Bench, the CCPA issued guidelines to curb unfair trade practices and protect consumer rights.The guidelines specify that:",Delhi high court rules that imposition of service charge by customers on food bills remains discretionary.

With ChatGPT maker OpenAI's latest GPT-4o update sparking a viral trend of Studio Ghibli-style portraits , social media is buzzing with ethereal, anime-inspired photos. However, this feature, rolled out on Tuesday, March 25, is currently limited to ChatGPT Plus, Pro, Team, and Select subscription tiers, leaving free-tier users out of the fun—at least for now. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman announced Wednesday that overwhelming demand has delayed the feature's rollout to free users, meaning those on the basic plan can't tap into the native image-generation capabilities of GPT-4o or Sora. But don't worry: you don't need ChatGPT Plus to join the Ghibli fest.AI models like Gemini or Grok can also create Studio Ghibli-style visuals—think lush greenery, soft lighting, and expressive characters—provided you're precise with your prompts, such as ""a serene Ghibli-style girl with flowing hair under a cherry blossom tree.""However, the output might differ from ChatGPT's GPT-4o creations, as each model interprets styles uniquely due to differences in training data and algorithms. While ChatGPT's images lean toward photorealistic finesse, Gemini, Grok, or trial-based platforms might produce a slightly more abstract or varied take on Ghibli's charm, requiring some experimentation to nail the vibe.You can still transform your photos or ideas into Studio Ghibli-inspired art without a ChatGPT subscription. Free platforms like Craiyon, DeepAI, and Playground AI offer AI image generation with varying levels of customization. Simply upload a photo or type a prompt like ""portrait in Studio Ghibli style, lush forest background, soft colors,"" and let the AI work its magic.Again, these tools may not match GPT-4o's photorealistic precision, but they can mimic Ghibli's whimsical aesthetic—think flowing hair, vibrant landscapes, and gentle expressions. For better control, try Artbreeder, which lets you blend images and tweak styles, though some features require a paid upgrade.If you're aiming for higher quality, platforms like Runway ML, Leonardo AI, or Mage.space offer free trials that rival ChatGPT's capabilities. Sign up, upload your image, and use prompts to emulate Ghibli's signature look—dreamy lighting, hand-drawn textures, and nature-infused scenes. These tools often provide more advanced editing options, letting you refine details like Totoro-esque fluffiness or Spirited Away-inspired hues.While ChatGPT Plus users revel in OpenAI's loosened style restrictions, these workarounds prove you don't need a subscription to create Ghibli magic. Experiment, share your results, and join the trend—subscription or not.","Chatgpt maker openai's latest gpt-4o update sparked a viral trend of studio ghibli-style portraits.

Skywatchers and astronomy enthusiasts are in for a spectacular celestial event as a partial solar eclipse is set to occur on March 29, 2025. This breathtaking phenomenon will follow a total lunar eclipse that took place just weeks earlier, adding to the excitement for stargazers. The eclipse will be particularly visible across parts of the northeastern United States and Canada, where observers will witness the moon partially obscuring the sun at sunrise, creating a stunning crescent-like effect.Unlike a total solar eclipse, where the moon completely blocks the sun, a partial eclipse leaves a portion of the sun visible, offering a unique viewing experience. This event will be visible to over 800 million people worldwide, making it one of the most widely observed astronomical occurrences of 2025. With proper precautions and the right viewing locations, this solar eclipse promises to be a memorable spectacle.According to Space.com, the March 29, 2025, solar eclipse will occur between 4:50 a.m. and 8:43 a.m. Eastern Time (ET). The event will be best visible at sunrise across several states in the northeastern U.S. and parts of Canada.The following states will have some of the best views of the partial solar eclipse, as reported by USA Today:Additionally, the eclipse will be visible across Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vermont, West Virginia, and Washington, D.C. However, visibility will depend on local weather conditions, so clear skies will be essential for an optimal viewing experience.A partial solar eclipse occurs when the moon moves between the Earth and the sun, but its alignment is not perfect, causing only a portion of the sun to be obscured. The extent to which the sun is covered depends on the observer's location. During this event, the moon will appear to take a ""bite"" out of the sun, producing a crescent-like visual effect.Although partial eclipses do not create the dramatic darkness of a total eclipse, they remain fascinating astronomical events. Observers will notice shadows appearing sharper, temperature drops, and changes in animal behavior during the peak of the eclipse.The March 29, 2025, eclipse is part of a series of solar eclipses that occur as the Earth, moon, and sun align at specific intervals. The moon’s orbital tilt prevents solar eclipses from occurring every month, making them relatively rare events.During a partial solar eclipse, the sun is never fully covered, and the extent of the obscuration depends on the observer's position on Earth. The phenomenon is a reminder of the intricate mechanics of celestial bodies and their predictable yet mesmerizing movements.At sunrise, when the eclipse reaches its peak in North America, the sun will appear as a thin crescent, giving the impression that a large portion of it has been ""bitten off."" As the moon moves along its orbit, the sun will gradually regain its full shape, marking the end of the event.Unlike lunar eclipses, which are safe to view with the naked eye, solar eclipses require special protective measures. Looking directly at the sun, even during a partial eclipse, can cause severe retinal damage, often referred to as ""eclipse blindness.""To safely observe the eclipse, experts recommend using:Standard sunglasses are not sufficient for protection and should not be used. Organizations such as NASA and the American Astronomical Society provide guidelines on purchasing certified eclipse glasses to ensure safe viewing.The partial solar eclipse will occur on March 29, 2025, between 4:50 a.m. and 8:43 a.m. Eastern Time (ET). It will be best visible at sunrise across the northeastern United States and parts of Canada. Some of the key locations for optimal viewing include New York, Massachusetts, Maine, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Virginia, among others.A partial solar eclipse occurs when the moon moves between the Earth and the sun but does not fully cover it. This results in a portion of the sun remaining visible, creating a crescent-like effect. In contrast, a total solar eclipse occurs when the moon completely obscures the sun, briefly turning day into night.Viewing a solar eclipse requires proper eye protection. Experts recommend using eclipse glasses that meet ISO 12312-2 safety standards, solar viewing filters, or indirect viewing methods such as pinhole projectors. Standard sunglasses are not safe for eclipse viewing, as they do not provide adequate protection against harmful UV rays.Solar eclipses are rare because the moon’s orbit is tilted relative to the Earth's orbit around the sun. This means that the moon, Earth, and sun do not always align perfectly. Eclipses only occur when their orbits intersect at specific points, leading to either partial or total solar eclipses.Yes, during the peak of the eclipse, observers may notice subtle environmental changes such as a slight drop in temperature, sharper shadows, and altered animal behavior. These effects occur because the reduced sunlight affects both the atmosphere and the natural world.","A partial solar eclipse will occur on march 29, 2025, in the northeastern u.s. and parts of canada. The event will be visible to over 800 million people worldwide, making it one of the most widely observed astronomical occurrences of 2025. During this event, the moon will appear to take a ""bite"" out of the sun, producing a crescent-like visual effect.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119586602,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-16398,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

As dawn breaks over Jebel Ali Port , the synchronised movements of cranes and the steady flow of cargo vessels highlight Dubai 's emergence as a global logistics hub. Once a vital transit point between East and West, the city is now actively shaping the future of global supply chains with cutting-edge technology, infrastructure, and government-backed smart trade initiatives.At the heart of this transformation is a flourishing trade relationship with India—one that is not only rooted in history but is now accelerating into the future, powered by AI-driven logistics, automation, and free trade agreements.For centuries, India and Dubai have shared a strong economic relationship, and today, that connection is being redefined by innovation. The UAE-India Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA), signed in 2022, eliminated tariffs on over 10,000 products and set a goal to increase non-oil trade to $100 billion by 2030 But beyond trade figures, Dubai offers Indian logistics firms something even more valuable—a world-class supply chain ecosystem, a thriving free trade environment, and an AI-powered logistics infrastructure that makes global expansion seamless.""India holds great strategic importance for DP World,"" said Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, Group Chairman and CEO of DP World. ""We have invested over $2.5 billion in the country’s logistics ecosystem to enhance domestic and global connectivity.”This commitment to enhancing India-UAE trade routes has positioned Dubai as a springboard for Indian logistics companies seeking global reach.Dubai’s logistics infrastructure is built for speed, scale, and efficiency. The Jebel Ali Port , one of the world's largest and busiest container ports, and Jebel Ali Free Zone ( Jafza ), which houses over 10,700 multinational companies, create a seamless supply chain network, reducing logistics costs and optimising operations.For Indian logistics startups, this presents a strategic advantage—access to a globally connected hub with state-of-the-art AI-driven solutions.“Many enterprises struggle with visibility into their logistics costs. They don’t always know how much they are spending or where inefficiencies lie,” says Deepesh Kuruppath, Founder & CEO of CargoFL, a supply chain AI platform. “In Dubai, we have found the perfect ecosystem to introduce AI-driven optimisations for large enterprises.”CargoFL’s platform identifies inefficiencies in a company’s supply chain and provides automation and digitisation solutions. With advanced AI-driven analytics, companies can save up to 10% on logistics costs, according to Kuruppath.Dubai has transformed to be a logistics and innovation hub. The city’s leadership in AI, automation, and blockchain technology is creating one of the most sophisticated digital supply chain ecosystems in the world.Government initiatives like the Dubai Silk Road strategy and the Dubai AI Strategy have transformed the logistics sector, making it easier for businesses to automate supply chain processes, track shipments in real-time, and optimize freight movements using predictive analytics.""We recognise the critical role the logistics sector plays in enabling the growth of industries globally,"" said Abdulla Bin Damithan, CEO and Managing Director of DP World UAE & Jafza . ""As the UAE continues to grow into a global processing and re-distribution gateway, we have experienced a significant spike in demand for logistics and warehousing space.”For companies like Fero.AI, Dubai is the ideal testing ground for logistics automation. “We operate in one of the most advanced trade ecosystems in the world,” says Abhinav Chaudhary, CEO and Founder of Fero.AI. “Dubai’s logistics infrastructure, combined with government-backed smart trade initiatives, has allowed us to integrate AI-powered solutions efficiently.”Fero.AI specialises in automating freight and supply chain processes and collaborates with DP World to implement AI-driven logistics solutions. The company sees Dubai as a perfect platform to introduce cutting-edge logistics automation technologies.Dubai’s free zones have made the emirate one of the most attractive destinations for Indian logistics firms. Jafza, for instance, offers - 100% foreign ownership, zero import/export duties, unrestricted currency repatriation, and simplified business setup processes.” For an Indian company, setting up in Jafza is almost seamless,"" says Kuruppath of CargoFL. “You don’t face the tax burdens and operational complexities that exist elsewhere. Dubai’s free zones are designed for logistics companies to thrive.”Jafza is expanding its logistics capacity with the development of the Jafza Logistics Park, a multi-tenant warehousing facility in the Jebel Ali Free Zone. Phase 1 of the project, which was scheduled for completion in 2023, was successfully completed as of November 2024.""We are building the Jafza Logistics Park in response to increasing demand and to further boost the development of the UAE’s logistics sector,"" added Damithan of DP World UAE & Jafza.With fast-track business licensing, cutting-edge warehousing facilities, and streamlined customs processes, Jafza has become a magnet for Indian logistics and supply chain companies.As India’s economy expands and Dubai cements its status as a global logistics hub, the partnership between the two regions is set to grow exponentially.“We are at the beginning of a major shift,” says Kuruppath of CargoFL. “Dubai is no longer just a transit hub—it is a technology hub. AI, automation, and smart logistics are redefining how supply chains function, and Indian companies have an opportunity to be at the forefront of this transformation.”For Indian logistics firms looking to scale globally, optimize costs, and tap into AI-driven supply chain solutions, the message is clear:Dubai is not just a bridge between East and West—it is the future of global logistics.Click this link for more on Business in Dubai.This article is a part of a featured content series on Business in Dubai.","Dubai has transformed to be a logistics and innovation hub.

Trump auto tariffs impact: Tata Motors shares declined 6.31% to Rs 663 during early trading hours on Thursday, following the announcement by US President Donald Trump regarding implementation of 25% tariff on imported cars and light trucks starting next week.The United States of America is a significant market for Jaguar Land Rover , contributing 22% of total sales according to JLR's annual report for the 2024 financial year.At 10:54 AM, Tata Motors shares were trading at Rs 675.65, down Rs 32 or 4.56% on the Bombay Stock Exchange. Tata Motors' stock has experienced a decline of 28.18% and lagged behind its sector's performance by 33.35% during the previous year.

The Chief Financial Officer validated the company's trajectory towards achieving the FY25 EBIT margin target of minimum 8.5%, whilst highlighting that JLR's volume performance in FY26 could be affected due to Jaguar models being discontinued.According to the ET report, the company indicated that potential U.S. tariffs on European imports might necessitate price adjustments and efficiency measures to offset the impact. While Trump plans to implement retaliatory tariffs on April 2, the U.S. administration has indicated selective enforcement. However, specific details about exempted countries or sectors remain unclear.This decision by Donald Trump intensifies international trade tensions following his return to the White House this year. Industry analysts suggest this development will lead to increased prices and supply chain disruptions in the automotive sector.“We're going to impose a 25% tariff on all cars not made in the United States,” Trump stated during an event in the Oval Office.Trump considers tariffs as a revenue source to balance his promised tax reductions and strengthen the U.S. industrial sector. He confirmed the tariffs would begin on April 3, following his planned announcement of reciprocal tariffs targeting nations with the largest contributions to the U.S. trade deficit.","Tata motors' stock has experienced a decline of 28.18% and lagged behind its sector's performance by 33.35% during the previous year.

As India looks set to become the world’s fourth largest economy next year, and the third largest in the later part of this decade, we take a look at 7 charts that show the incredible growth story of India and ask experts about what led to the 100% rise in GDP:

India’s Rise in numbers

India’s nominal GDP in 2015 was $2,103.6 billion. Come 2025, the IMF projects that it will reach $4,271.9 billion. That's over 100% growth in just 10 years!

Among the top 10 largest world economies, India has exhibited the highest growth in GDP. Three out of the present top 4 world economies have seen a decent GDP growth in 10 years; 65.8% for the US, 75.8% for China and 43.7% for Germany. Japan’s economy has contracted 1.3% in the last 10 years, as per IMF’s October 2024 World Economic Outlook.

Back in 2014, India was the world’s 10th largest economy in terms of nominal GDP. From there, it has risen through the ranks to become the world’s 5th largest economy - a feat it achieved in 2021.

A recent SBI Research report notes that with the government's efforts to ensure quality of life for all citizens and stopped leakage of benefits through Direct Benefit Transfer, the per capita GDP at current prices stood at Rs 2.35 lakh in FY25, with decadal CAGR growth of 9.1%. “In constant prices too, per capita GDP has increased to Rs 1.33 lakh in FY25. In the last two fiscals, the per capita GDP jumped by more than Rs 40,000 at current prices,” says the SBI Research report.

India’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) has doubled in the last 10 years - a huge feat for an economy that is also set to become the world’s third largest in a few years. India’s economic growth has come despite a major economic setback in the form of the Covid pandemic a few years ago.According to latest International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) data, India’s GDP under the Narendra Modi government has seen 103.1% growth in GDP at current prices or nominal GDP. It has also gone from being the world’s 10th largest economy to the fifth largest.How has India managed to double its GDP in just ten years? What factors have worked to propel the economy, which at one time had been infamously ranked among the ‘Fragile Five’?Suggesting strong economic fundamentals, India will continue to be the fastest growing major economy in the coming years as well, says IMF. It has projected that India’s GDP will grow at 6.5% in both FY 2025 and FY 2026.All other top 10 world economies will grow at much lower rates - with China projected to see the second highest GDP growth rate of 4.5%.With a healthy GDP growth rate, the Indian economy is expected to surpass Japan in 2026 as the world’s 4th largest economy. It is likely to become the third largest economy in the world in nominal GDP terms by 2028, according to IMF projections.India’s GDP is expected to rise to $5723.3 billion by 2028 and $6307.2 billion by 2029. In 2029, the world’s largest economy, the US, is projected to have a GDP of $35458 billion - which is 5.62 times India’s GDP!In the interactive chart above, we take a look at India's rise from 2015 to 2029 (projected). The GDP data for US and China is not highlighted since they will continue to the top two world economies through these years.Economists credit the government policies and reforms with focus on manufacturing sector, exports, digitalization, GST and capital expenditure push for the infrastructure sector as major reasons for the astounding rise in nominal GDP numbers.Madan Sabnavis, chief economist at Bank of Baroda says a number of factors have come together to enable this rather remarkable growth in the Indian economy:Agriculture has been very resilient in this decade notwithstanding erratic climatic conditions. This is something which has kept output ticking as well as rural incomes stable.India Inc has delivered quite well over the years in terms of expansion of business, investment, employment and diversification. This has created a very strong industrial sector. Several industries are a part of global supply chains.The government has provided a very facilitative framework for business through a plethora of policies like Make in India, PLI, tax regime, MSME loans etc, he tells TOI.a. At the same time the upliftment for the lower segments through direct measures has elevated standard of living as comes out from the consumption survey data.b. The widespread use of technology though the digitization process has cut down on cost and ensured transparency in dealings.c. GST has been a major breakthrough which has improved transparency.d. The fiscal deficit has been brought under control with the focus being on prudence which has allowed the government to spend more on capex.Also Read | Trump tariffs impact: Is a US recession likely and does India need to worry about it?

Made the banking system resilient and robust by leaning up balance sheets of banks.b. Brought in pro-active regulation to ensure stability of the system.c. Monetary policy streamlined on global standards with MPC to fight inflation.The large flow of FDI has supplemented domestic capital and enhanced investment in the country.The capital market has enabled raising of both equity and debt which is required for financing investment in the country. Here the regulator SEBI has been proactive all through to ensure there are no mis-steps.“Therefore, the story is one of pragmatic polices, prudent regulation, successful business entrepreneurship which has moulded well in the process of globalization,” he tells TOI.Also Read | Why Jim Walker, man who foresaw 2008 market crash, wants investors to ‘absolutely double down’ on Indian equities According to Dharmakirti Joshi, Chief Economist at Crisil, “The government's emphasis on infrastructure development has contributed to higher-than-expected GDP growth following the pandemic. The introduction of GST enhanced tax compliance and increased government revenues, enabling greater budgetary spending on infrastructure.”DK Joshi also believes that the rapid advancements in digital infrastructure have facilitated efficient payment systems, quicker credit delivery, and fostered innovation. “The healthy balance sheets of banks have also supported faster credit growth,” he tells TOI.Radhika Rao, Senior Economist at DBS Bank notes that in the past decade, there has been a strong focus towards higher capital expenditure from the government as well as households, with the latter reflected in rising contribution to real estate and construction.She credits the successive budgets that have seen a sharp increase in capex outlays, which has positive multipliers for the economy while the stickier revenue expenditure has been gradually rationalised.“Concurrently, the composition of external trade has also undergone a change with rising share of manufactured goods in exports and strong gains in services, led by the contribution of global capability centres. These have not only helped make the net export balance less negative but have also helped to improve the health of the current account balance,” she tells TOI.Also Read | Donald Trump's tariffs: India may be among least vulnerable Asian economies in trade war with US - but there's a catch!

China's Richest Reshuffle

About Zhang Yiming

TikTok owner ByteDance Ltd. 's founder Zhang Yiming has emerged as the wealthiest individual in China, marking his first ascent to this position. On Wednesday, Zhang claimed the top spot by overtaking Zhong Shanshan, known for his bottled water enterprise, and Tencent Holdings' co-founder Ma Huateng, with his wealth valued at $57.5 billion, according to a Bloomberg report.This achievement is particularly noteworthy for the 41-year-old, considering the recent challenges, including potential US restrictions on TikTok, ByteDance's popular application, and a temporary withdrawal of music content from the platform by the world's largest record label.Following a decline in Nongfu Spring Co.'s earnings that affected Zhong's wealth, Zhang secured the premier position. In the Asian wealth hierarchy, he now stands third, following Indian industrialists Mukesh Ambani and Gautam Adani, as per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index .Zhang's net worth increased by over $10 billion after Bloomberg's analysis of valuations from institutional investors BlackRock Inc., Fidelity Investments and T. Rowe Price Group Inc., alongside ByteDance's intention to repurchase employee shares at a $312 billion valuation. The four valuations averaged $365 billion.Also Read | Mukesh Ambani drops out of world’s top 10 richest persons list, retains Asia’s wealthiest person tag - check list The status of TikTok's operations in the United States remains uncertain. US President Donald Trump extended the deadline by 75 days - until April 5 - for ByteDance to secure a purchaser for its US operations or risk prohibition.According to Bloomberg News, Oracle Corp. is considering a proposal to acquire TikTok's US operations that would involve providing security guarantees and acquiring a minor stake in a new US entity, whilst potentially allowing the application's crucial algorithm to remain under Chinese control.On Wednesday, Trump indicated his willingness to consider reducing tariffs on China to obtain Beijing's backing for the sale of TikTok's US operations to an American organisation. He expressed confidence in securing at least a preliminary agreement for TikTok by the following week but stated that if a deal remained incomplete, he would pursue a deadline extension.ByteDance maintains a prominent position in China's artificial intelligence sector. Its AI chatbot Doubao serves 75 million regular active users, whilst the organisation reports that its earlier vision understanding model operates at costs 85% below the industry standard, similar to DeepSeek.Also Read | Elon Musk is world’s richest person on Hurun Rich List with $420 billion net worth - it’s the 'Trump Effect' at work? Zhang stands apart from traditional Chinese billionaires due to his innovative and globally-focused enterprise, according to Hao Gao, who serves as director at Tsinghua University's Research Centre for Global Family Business.Currently residing in Singapore, Zhang, a Chinese citizen, accumulated his fortune solely through his 21% ownership in ByteDance, the parent company of TikTok, which boasts over 1 billion users worldwide.His professional journey began at Kuxun.com, a tourism search website, where he worked as an engineer. He ventured into entrepreneurship in 2009 by establishing 99fang.com, a property search platform, which he departed from after three years.In 2012, he established ByteDance from a modest flat in Beijing, introducing the Toutiao news application, which garnered over 13 million daily users within two years. His vision was to develop an AI-driven platform distinct from Baidu, China's dominant search engine.""The most important thing is that we are not a news business,"" Zhang said in a 2017 interview. ""We are more like a search business or a social media platform. We are doing very innovative work. We are not a copycat of a US company, both in product and technology.""ByteDance introduced TikTok (known as Douyin in China) in 2016, initially attracting a modest following. The application quickly gained popularity amongst younger generations and achieved global success in subsequent years. The company acquired Musical.ly, a Chinese social media platform, for approximately $800 million in 2018, subsequently incorporating it into TikTok. The organisation has since developed into a diverse conglomerate, offering various applications ranging from video content to entertainment platforms featuring humour and celebrity news.Zhang relinquished his position as chief executive in 2021, followed shortly by his resignation as chairman. Similarly, other prominent billionaires, including Jack Ma of Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Colin Huang of PDD Holdings Inc., have also withdrawn from active management roles in their respective organisations.","Zhang yiming has emerged as the wealthiest individual in china, marking his first ascent to this position.

Trump LIVE: ‘You Hang On There…’: US President Gets Upset During Big Announcement | Watch

Why it matters

Tesla manufactures all of the vehicles it sells in the US domestically — primarily at its Fremont, California, and Austin, Texas, plants. That gives the company a major advantage over rivals like GM, Ford, and international brands such as Hyundai, Toyota, and Volkswagen, which rely heavily on imports or cross-border supply chains.

But while Tesla’s final assembly happens on US soil, many parts used in its vehicles come from overseas. That includes everything from electric motors to lithium-ion battery cells and raw materials that are essential for EV production. Those components will now be taxed, raising Tesla’s production costs and, potentially, sticker prices.

The tariffs arrive at a time when Tesla is already grappling with declining market share and rising competition. Musk has warned investors that the company’s growth rate may slow this year. Higher production costs due to tariffs could make it harder to compete on price in an increasingly crowded EV market.

Zoom in

Tesla’s Model Y and Model 3 were the top-selling EVs in the US in 2024.

Competitors like GM’s Chevrolet Equinox EV and Ford’s Mustang Mach-E — both built in Mexico — are now facing much steeper cost increases.

Analysts estimate that tariffs could add as much as $6,000 to the price of a vehicle made in Mexico or Canada, and up to $12,000 for some EVs, depending on component sourcing.

Tesla’s stock dipped about 1.3% following Trump’s announcement — less than other automakers, a sign investors see it as relatively insulated.

Despite that insulation, Musk is pushing back against any idea that Tesla will benefit unilaterally. The company’s complex global supply chain, like those of other automakers, remains vulnerable.

The big picture

Between the lines

Trump insists the tariffs will bring jobs and factories back to the US. But even auto executives warn the sudden change could disrupt a finely tuned supply network built over decades. Industry analysts expect a sharp production drop of up to 30% across North America — translating to as many as 20,000 fewer vehicles produced per day.

Jonathan Smoke, chief economist at Cox Automotive, forecast ""virtually all North American vehicle production"" would be disrupted by mid-April. That includes vehicles assembled in the US using imported parts now subject to tariffs. “Lower production, tighter supply, and higher prices are around the corner,” Smoke told the NYT.

Tesla might avoid some of the worst disruption thanks to its US-based final assembly. But Musk’s comments reflect the reality that even Tesla’s vertically integrated model isn’t immune to global pricing pressures.

Raw materials like lithium, cobalt, and nickel — critical to EV battery production — are still largely sourced and processed overseas. In recent years, Tesla has tried to localize more of its supply chain, but shifting mining and refining operations to the US is a long, capital-intensive process.

What they’re saying

As per a Bloomberg report, here is a summary of all important reactions.

President Donald Trump: “What we’re going to be doing is a 25% tariff on all cars that are not made in the United States. We’re going to charge countries for doing business in our country and taking our jobs, taking our wealth, taking a lot of things that they’ve been taking over the years.”

We’re going to charge countries for doing business in our country and taking our jobs, taking our wealth, taking a lot of things that they’ve been taking over the years.” Trump again, on the broader goal: “That’s the real Liberation Day of America, and that’s going to be in April 2, and I look forward to it.”

“That’s the real Liberation Day of America, and that’s going to be in April 2, and I look forward to it.” Jennifer Safavian, president of Autos Drive America: “The tariffs imposed today will make it more expensive to produce and sell cars in the United States, ultimately leading to higher prices, fewer options for consumers and fewer manufacturing jobs in the US.”

“The tariffs imposed today will make it more expensive to produce and sell cars in the United States, ultimately leading to higher prices, fewer options for consumers and fewer manufacturing jobs in the US.” United Auto Workers President Shawn Fain: “Ending the race to the bottom in the auto industry starts with fixing our broken trade deals, and the Trump administration has made history with today’s actions.”

“Ending the race to the bottom in the auto industry starts with fixing our broken trade deals, and the Trump administration has made history with today’s actions.” Ontario Premier Doug Ford: “We’re going to make sure that we inflict as much pain as possible to the American people without inflicting pain on the Canadian population.”

“We’re going to make sure that we inflict as much pain as possible to the American people without inflicting pain on the Canadian population.” European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen: “We will now assess this announcement, together with other measures the US is envisaging in the next days. The EU will continue to seek negotiated solutions, while safeguarding its economic interests.”

“We will now assess this announcement, together with other measures the US is envisaging in the next days. The EU will continue to seek negotiated solutions, while safeguarding its economic interests.” Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney: “The US tariffs are a direct attack on people who work in the auto industry and violate the US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.”

What’s next

The bottom line

US President Donald Trump on Wednesday signed a sweeping proclamation imposing a 25% tariff on all imported cars, trucks, and key auto parts — a move that could redraw the global auto landscape. While Tesla may be better positioned than many rivals, CEO Elon Musk made it clear his company won’t emerge unscathed.“Important to note that Tesla is NOT unscathed here. The tariff impact on Tesla is still significant,” Musk wrote in a post on X.The new tariffs, which go into effect April 2, will hit not only fully assembled vehicles but also engines, transmissions, electrical systems, and other crucial components sourced from abroad — including from US allies like Mexico and Canada. The Trump administration has signaled the levies are permanent and will not be subject to negotiation.Also read: Donald Trump announces new auto tariffs ahead of April 2 deadline The auto tariffs are part of Trump’s broader trade agenda, aimed at reshaping US manufacturing and reducing reliance on foreign imports. They come on the heels of a similar move targeting imports from Canada and Mexico, which were initially delayed but are now scheduled for full implementation.“What we’re going to be doing is a 25% tariff on all cars that are not made in the United States,” Trump said Wednesday. “We’re going to charge countries for doing business in our country and taking our jobs.”While the White House says cars produced under the USMCA agreement can avoid full tariffs if they meet strict US content thresholds, the process to certify parts and vehicles remains undefined. In the meantime, many vehicles — including those from Detroit’s Big Three — face an immediate financial squeeze.GM, for example, imports key models like the Chevy Trax and Equinox from South Korea and Mexico. Ford builds the entry-level Maverick and Bronco Sport in Mexico. Stellantis (maker of Jeep, Chrysler, Dodge, and Ram) brings in vehicles from Mexico, Canada, and even Italy.Foreign brands face even steeper challenges. Hyundai and Kia imported over a million vehicles to the US last year. Volkswagen, Toyota, Honda, and BMW also rely heavily on international supply chains. Analysts expect new-car prices to rise significantly — in some cases by thousands of dollars — across the board.“There are very few winners,” Sam Fiorani, vice president at AutoForecast Solutions, told Bloomberg. “Consumers will be losers because they will have reduced choice and higher prices.”The US government is expected to begin enforcing tariffs on imported vehicles and components starting April 2. Duties on specific auto parts are scheduled to begin by May 3. A process to assess and certify US content in vehicles assembled in North America under USMCA is still being developed.Trump has hinted at further moves — including a tax deduction for interest on car loans, but only for American-made vehicles. That could further tilt the playing field in Tesla’s favor, especially as it pushes to lower prices and expand EV adoption.“If you borrow money to buy a car, you’re allowed to deduct interest payments... but only if the car is made in America,” Trump said.Tesla may emerge as one of the least affected players in the wake of Trump’s tariffs, but it’s not a free pass. Costs are rising, parts of its supply chain are under threat, and the entire industry is entering a period of volatility and uncertainty.Musk’s warning underscores the reality: even domestic automakers are caught in the storm. Still, with rivals facing steeper cost hikes and supply disruptions, Tesla’s relative advantage could become more pronounced — if it can navigate the new terrain without losing its footing.(With inputs from agencies)","Tesla manufactures all of the vehicles it sells in the us domestically.
