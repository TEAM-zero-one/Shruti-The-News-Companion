Not end of the road for gaming sector: IT secretary,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/not-end-of-the-road-for-gaming-sector-it-secretary/articleshow/123491081.cms,"IT secretary S Krishnan said the ban on money gaming doesn't mean doom and gloom for the sector, with ample growth opportunities existing in the social games and e-sports categories.

In an interview with TOI, Krishnan denied that companies were not given sufficient opportunities to provide their views, adding that action against money games was taken after unanimity across the political spectrum to act against the entities to ensure the welfare of 45 crore users who were addicted to the platforms and even committed suicide after suffering losses. Excerpts:

Gaming companies say that it is all doom and gloom for the sector after the new legislation banned

online money games

. Do you agree?

Companies say you've broken the backbone of the industry by killing the only incredibly large revenue stream...

Companies deny that the larger organised entities were engaged in terror support or for that matter money laundering...

Companies also allege the action signals govt is against entrepreneurship...

I would strongly disagree with the statement. What the bill has done is to give clarity to the entire gaming sector. A number of people from the sector, who met me over time also demanded that there should be clarity in the way the sector is administered, so that the baby doesn't get thrown out with the bathwater, literally. So, this is the clarity which many members of the industry had asked for. There is an institutional framework that has been created, which was another demand of the industry, which said it was not happy or satisfied with the way the self-regulatory bodies were to be created under the April 2023 amendments to the IT rules.They felt that there should be a proper authority, and that has been created now. I see a lot of prospects. We have to recognise that e-sports and social gaming are extremely large segments of the overall gaming industry. We should not make the mistake of assuming that money games are the biggest part of the industry.We have to look at the social distress of crores of families. As many as 45 crore people in India play online money games. Addiction and financial ruin of families is a very crucial factor. So, are we looking at the welfare of crores of families, or are we looking at a few companies which employ probably thousands of employees? I'm sure those employees will find other jobs. What you find in this case is consensus across the political spectrum.I have been in any number of Parliament committee meetings where MPs from across the political spectrum demanded to know what the govt was doing to come down hard on online money gaming. All the options were presented to the political executive and implications of each of the steps were explained in terms of possible job losses, revenue implications, etc. I think it was a very conscious decision that the welfare of crores of families is something which has to be prioritised.I'm not saying that every company is indulging in this activity. However, there are reports from the financial intelligence unit under the department of revenue, which cite a large number of suspicious transactions that have taken place. There are also reports from other agencies involved in national security. I think we have to go by what they say and not by what the companies say.This is an unfair statement. I think there are a number of programmes of govt that support entrepreneurship. Tech entrepreneurship is being supported, we are supporting those building AI models, and those developing AI applications. Is that not support for entrepreneurship? Are only people in the online money gaming industry entrepreneurs?","It secretary s krishnan said the ban on money gaming doesn't mean doom and gloom for the sector, with ample growth opportunities existing in the social games and e-sports categories.

While on orbit I tried to capture pictures and videos so that I can share this journey with you all. This is a timelapse video of Bharat from space. The ISS is moving from south to north from the Indian Ocean, along the east coast of India.”He explained that the purple flashes seen in the video were thunderstorms across the country, followed by the Himalayas fading into view, and then a sunrise over the orbit — all against the backdrop of shimmering stars. “It truly is a mesmerising dance of natural elements turning into one beautiful spectacle,” Shukla wrote, adding that despite heavy monsoon clouds he managed to “steal a few shots of Bharat.”""Unfortunately I was up there during the monsoon season and it was mostly cloudy, yet I managed to steal a few shots of Bharat, one of which you are seeing.

He pointed to recent successes such as the GSLV-F16 launch of the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite and the growth of India’s private space ecosystem from a single startup to more than 300 today.The Axiom-4 mission, he said, underlined India’s rising global stature in space exploration and collaboration.","Astronaut shubhanshu shukla on friday shared a breathtaking timelapse video of india from space.

NEW DELHI: After a delay of more than six months, the Centre has approved negotiations for building six advanced submarines in India with German collaboration under Project 75 India.According to defence officials quoted by ANI, the defence ministry and state-owned Mazagaon Dockyards Limited (MDL) have been given clearance to begin talks with German firm ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems. Negotiations are expected to start by the end of this month, with the contract likely to be finalised within six months.The decision followed a high-level meeting involving top defence and national security officials who reviewed India’s submarine programme and future fleet requirements. The proposed submarines will feature Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) systems, enabling them to remain submerged for up to three weeks, a significant capability boost for the Indian Navy Officials said the project aims not just to expand the submarine fleet but also to strengthen indigenous capability in designing and manufacturing conventional submarines. The move comes as India faces the twin challenge of modernising its fleet and countering rapid naval expansion by China and Pakistan.The Navy plans to replace about 10 ageing submarines over the next decade. In parallel, India is also pursuing nuclear submarine projects, with private sector major Larsen & Toubro working alongside the Submarine Building Centre to develop two nuclear attack submarines.With Project 75 India, the government is looking to accelerate submarine production and ensure the Navy’s operational readiness in the Indian Ocean region.","Centre gives clearance to defence ministry, mdl to begin negotiations for rs 70,000 crore submarine deal.

NEW DELHI: The department of posts on Saturday announced a temporary suspension of most international postal services to the United States, effective August 25, 2025, in response to major regulatory changes introduced by the US government that impact the international shipping of goods.As per the statement issued by the government, this decision follows the issuance of Executive Order No. 14324 by the US administration on July 30, 2025, which withdraws the duty-free de minimis exemption for goods valued up to USD 800, a threshold that previously allowed low-value goods to enter the US without customs duties.Beginning August 29, 2025, all goods sent to the US, regardless of their value, will be subject to customs duties under the International Emergency Economic Power Act (IEEPA) tariff framework.Gift items valued up to USD 100 will remain exempt from these new duties, according to the executive order.The executive order also outlines new responsibilities for transport carriers and “qualified parties” authorized by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). These entities are now required to collect and remit duties on international postal shipments.Although CBP released initial guidelines on August 15, 2025, critical implementation details, such as the process for designating “qualified parties” and systems for collecting and remitting duties, have not yet been finalized.Due to these unresolved issues, air carriers handling US-bound international mail have expressed their inability to accept postal consignments after August 25 citing lack of technical and operational preparedness to comply with the new requirements.As a result, the Department of Posts will suspend the booking of all categories of international postal articles destined for the US with effect from August 25 except for the following:These exempted categories will continue to be accepted and transported to the US, subject to further clarifications from CBP and the United States Postal Service (USPS).The department is in close coordination with all relevant stakeholders and is actively monitoring developments. Efforts are being made to resume full postal operations to the US as soon as possible, as per a PIB release.Customers who have already booked items that are no longer eligible for dispatch under the new conditions may apply for a refund of postage.The department expressed regret for the inconvenience caused and reaffirmed its commitment to restoring full service at the earliest opportunity.",The department of posts on saturday announced a temporary suspension of most international postal services to the united states.

Ethanol-blended petrol push: PIL in Supreme Court challenges nationwide sale of E20; claims 'engines are suffering',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ethanol-blended-petrol-push-pil-in-supreme-court-challenges-nationwide-sale-of-e20-claims-engines-are-suffering/articleshow/123457552.cms,"India's E20 Push



Is all petrol in India now E20?



How is E20 different from E10 or E15?



What impact does E20 have on vehicles?



What Government said?



NEW DELHI: A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has been filed in the Supreme Court against the nationwide rollout of 20% Ethanol Blended Petrol (E20), claiming that millions of motorists are being forced to use fuel their vehicles are not designed for.The plea, filed by advocate Akshay, has sought directions to the ministry of petroleum & natural gas to ensure ethanol-free petrol (E0) is made available at all fuel stations across the country.The PIL argues that cars and two-wheelers manufactured before 2023 and even some newer BS-VI models, are not compatible with high ethanol blends like E20.""Direct the respondents to ensure that consumers are informed about ethanol compatibility of their vehicles at the time of fuel dispensing. Engines are suffering corrosion, fuel efficiency is dropping, and repair bills are mounting, while insurance companies are rejecting claims for damage caused by ethanol fuel,"" the plea stated.The petitioner further sought clear labelling of ethanol content at all petrol pumps and dispensing units so that consumers are fully informed about what they are purchasing.The petition highlighted that global practices differ sharply.In countries like the US and EU, ethanol-free petrol continues to be widely available, and pumps clearly display the ethanol content.In India, however, only ethanol-blended petrol is sold, and there is no disclosure of composition at dispensing units, the plea added.India has accelerated its transition to E20 fuel, a blend of 20% ethanol and 80% petrol, as part of its efforts to cut carbon emissions and reduce dependence on imported crude oil.The nationwide rollout, originally planned for 2030, has now been advanced to 2025. While the government has set ambitious targets, questions remain over the availability of compatible vehicles, supply logistics, and consumer awareness.Not yet. Many petrol pumps are still offering E10 (10% ethanol), while E20 is being gradually introduced in select regions. The government’s aim is to achieve 100% E20 availability across India by 2025.The number indicates the ethanol percentage in the fuel blend. For example, E10 has 10% ethanol, E15 has 15%, and E20 contains 20%. The higher the ethanol content, the lower the reliance on crude oil imports.According to several reports, many motorists have expressed concerns about the impact of E20 fuel, particularly on fuel efficiency.While ethanol has lower energy density than petrol, the mileage impact is relatively small. For E10 vehicles tuned for E20, the drop is just 1-2% .In other vehicles, the reduction could range between 3-6% and even that can be minimised with proper engine tuning, reported ANI.The ministry of petroleum and natural gas issued a statement rejecting all viral social media posts alleging that E20 causes a major fall in fuel efficiency.Calling the claims ""factually incorrect,"" the ministry said they lack any scientific backing or expert validation.","A public interest litigation (pil) has been filed in the supreme court against the rollout of 20% ethanol blended petrol (e20) the plea, filed by advocate akshay, has sought directions to the ministry of petroleum & natural gas to ensure ethanol-free petrol (e0) is made available at all fuel stations across the country.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123458210,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-58496,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Is Roblox really shutting down after backlash and ongoing scrutiny?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/news/is-roblox-really-shutting-down-after-backlash-and-ongoing-scrutiny/articleshow/123382058.cms,"(Image via Getty Images)

Is Roblox shutting down?



""While this was not an easy choice, we believe it is in the best interest of our community. We want to thank everyone who has been part of this journey. Your voices have been heard, and your well-being remains our top priority.""

""Effective September Ist, the platform will no longer be available,""

What can lead to Roblox finally being shut down in 2025?



A viral notice that claims Roblox will shut down on September 1, 2025, permanently has ignited a panic among its players. The message in the notice cited Roblox safety concerns and the popular demand for the platform to shut down, as the reasons behind their step. This notice that now seems to be all over X, and gaining a lot of attention, is coming at a time when Roblox is facing legal scrutiny and international bans. So, is this the end of the popular gaming platform, or is it just a part of the recurring hoax?Here is all we know about the circulating news and whether or not it is officially true.An official-looking announcement, stating Roblox is shutting down, has spread rapidly on X. It states that Roblox made a decision to shut down permanently from September 1, 2025, due to user demand and security concerns. The official announcement further stated,While the announcement that seemed to be official, stated,there is still no news of whether or not it is true. Quite crucially, no official confirmation has been received about this from Roblox. Fans are, therefore, speculating, it is just a hoax, like all the other times before. So, until any confirmation is received, one can relax and continue playing their favorite on the platform.This is not the first time that rumors of Roblox shutting down have surfaced all over social media. In the past, news about Roblox being shut down has spread and repeatedly, those were denied. The claims of Roblox shutdown were called rumors, and a hoax.The platform gave reassurances to the players that the game “isn’t going anywhere.”What’s interesting about the current circulating claims is that Roblox has been under a lot of pressure. From demands for the Roblox CEO resignation to changes in their policies and even the drop in the share price of Roblox, fans speculate that this time, the news can be true. Even the lack of denial or immediate confirmation from the end of Roblox is quite unusual. It has left this situation ambiguous, with players awaiting an official statement soon.While Roblox isn’t any stranger to controversies, the recent lawsuits against the platform by the state of Louisiana, accusing it of failing to protect the young crowd from inappropriate content and predators, have taken a major toll. Games like Public Bathroom Simulator Vibe, Escape to Epstein Island and Diddy Party have also been cited as examples of Roblox explicit content that have been accessible to minors.The lawsuit was not an isolated incident. Many countries, including Turkey, China, and Oman, have banned the platform. Now with Qatar's recent Roblox ban, after social media pushing to take action, over the platform's rising child safety concerns, have brought a lot of Roblox legal troubles. Critics argue that the rapid growth of Roblox has outpaced the platform’s ability to enforce needed moderation. While Roblox did bring in safety measures, including Roblox AI monitoring, there are many who believe all these measures are just reactive and not preventative.In short, with the Roblox international bans, lawsuits, and the player-led boycotts, like #BoycottTheHatch,” Roblox has been facing mounting pressure. The recent viral notice circulating about Roblox shutting down—whether fake or real—shows increased frustration amongst the users, critics and concerned citizens. Moreover, what actions are being taken by the platform that has reportedly earned a lifetime revenue of more than $1 billion and has made over $70 million in the payouts to the creators, for addressing the rising concerns of the authorities, gamers, general audience and others, only time would tell.As of now, the gaming platform remains operational, with millions of gamers aiming for it to be the same. However, the company being silent on the latest rumors is quite concerning. In case the legal actions do succeed, some stricter regulations can force major changes, or worse. It can even make the platform back off by finally shutting it down.","A viral notice that claims roblox will shut down on september 1, 2025, permanently has ignited a panic among its players.

NBA legend Kevin Durant 's old home has been on sale for just $35. After leaving to join the Golden State Warriors, the NBA great reportedly sold the house for $1.15 million,But the current owners were only ready to list it for $35. In order to accommodate him comfortably, he also had it remodeled to incorporate extra-large showers and bathtubs. Nevertheless, it has recently been revealed that listing the home for such a low price was merely a marketing ploy.During his NBA career, Kevin Durant has amassed a substantial real estate holding, acquiring luxurious homes in places like Phoenix, San Francisco, New York, Oklahoma City, and Seattle. However, he later had to sell his Oklahoma City house, which recently hit the market with a shockingly low price.Before the reason for the low price was made public, the property garnered headlines for its low price. Leasha Larkpor of Thunder Team Realty, an agent in Oklahoma City , listed the house. However, she later clarified the reason. In July, she sent an email to the New York Post and revealed that it was just a marketing gimmick. She further stated:""The owner felt like a basketball enthusiast or Kevin Durant fan would be interested in owning a piece of history… The owner is expecting to have offers around $1 million.""The agent's website no longer has the listing. The Paycom Centre, where the OKC Thunders play their home games, is only a short drive from the gorgeous townhouse. It has three levels.According to Realtor.com, the NBA icon purchased the two three-story brownstones and then combined them into a single residence. With six bedrooms and nine bathrooms, the remodeled house had 7,257 square feet.One townhouse was intended for private life, while the other was intended for entertaining guests. The luxurious amenities included a large sauna, a theatre, and a billiard room.He joined the San Francisco Golden State Warriors in 2016 after retiring his OKC Thunder uniform. He offered his renovated residences for $1.5 million before he left town.After being selected by the Seattle Supersonics in the 2007 NBA Draft, Kevin Durant spent a season playing with the Seattle franchise before they moved to Oklahoma City and changed their name to the Thunder.The property in Oklahoma City was owned by the power forward throughout his nine-year tenure with the Thunders, from 2007 to 2016. Before joining the Golden State Warriors , he made his debut with the team.The current owner is anticipating offers that are more in line with the $1.15 million Durant sold the property for, according to Leasha Larkpor. While playing for the team, he used to reside in an opulent townhouse.Meanwhile, during his time in Oklahoma City, he captained the franchise for several seasons. Then, before relocating to Houston, the 36-year-old played with the Brooklyn Nets and Phoenix Suns.Also read: Oklahoma City Thunder guard Alex Caruso marries Haleigh Broucher and celebrates romantic honeymoon in Ravello, Italy","Nba legend kevin durant's old home has been on sale for just $35.

Karnataka Bike Taxi Services: Karnataka’s transport minister orders aggregators to stop bike-taxi services in Bengaluru; but captains and riders happily vroom away,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnatakas-transport-minister-asks-aggregators-to-stop-bike-taxi-services-in-bengaluru/articleshow/123460902.cms,"Waive platform fee: Riders

BENGALURU: The road ahead for bike-taxi services appears to be smooth, at least for now. Crippled by lack of last-mile connectivity and uncertain auto or cab rides, customers are happily hopping on to bikes and reaching their destination without hassle.While Karnataka high court has clarified that it hasn't passed any order allowing the resumption of bike-taxi services and that the state govt is free to act against ride-hailing aggregators in keeping with existing legal provisions, the court also said individual bike owners offering taxi services or the ride captains must not be harassed by the authorities. On Friday, taxi aggregators continued to provide bike taxis on their respective platforms.Transport minister Ramalinga Reddy told TOI that aggregators must comply with the court's directive. ""Aggregators must disable bike-taxi services on their apps. We'll monitor the situation closely. If there are violations, then we'll take appropriate action,"" he said.On Thursday morning, three major ride-hailing apps — Uber, Rapido, and Ola — resumed bike-taxi services after a gap of two months. Waseem Akram K, 25, said it's a huge relief that bike taxis are back in the city.""When the service was stopped, people like me who depended on bikes during emergencies or peak traffic hours really struggled. Bikes are cheaper and far more convenient than autos or cabs. For instance, if I travel alone, paying over Rs 100 for an auto makes no sense, while a bike ride on the same route costs just Rs 49,"" he said, adding he commutes from Mahadevapura to Marathahalli every day.Even thousands of riders are relieved. They had switched to other gigs after the blanket ban on bike-taxi services came into force two months ago. Ashok K, a rider, said, ""For two months, I struggled a lot. I joined two delivery services, but earnings were poor. It took an hour to pick up a parcel and deliver it to the customer. I used to get Rs 40 to Rs 50 per delivery, which is not worth the money spent. Whereas with bike taxis, the returns are higher. I earn up to Rs 1,000 a day.""Another bike-taxi rider claimed they received a message from aggregators on Thursday that the ""high court has allowed"" bike-taxi services. ""I accepted 5-6 bookings on Thursday, and a lot more rides on Friday,"" he added.The Bike Taxi Association has requested taxi aggregators to allow riders to use their application free of cost. A press release from association president Adi Narayan said, ""We request platforms to access technology free of cost so that we can start earning a livelihood once again. For lakhs of us, your platform is our only way to connect with customers.""",Karnataka high court has clarified that it hasn't passed any order allowing the resumption of bike-taxi services.

A billionaire breaking the mold

Judy Faulkner, the 82-year-old CEO of Epic Systems, has built a remarkable $7.8 billion fortune through her 43% stake in the company, yet she has never taken a single share for personal use. Instead, she has committed to giving away nearly all her wealth to philanthropic causes, signing Bill Gates’ Giving Pledge in 2015 to donate 99% of her fortune. Beyond finances, Faulkner has created a corporate culture that values creativity, curiosity, and learning. From whimsical themed office buildings to innovative company-wide gatherings, she proves that leadership and generosity can coexist, while setting an example for other business leaders that success can be measured not only in profits but also in positive impact on employees and society.Faulkner, together with her husband, launched Roots & Wings to provide grants to nonprofits dedicated to improving the health, education, and well-being of children and families. Since its inception, the foundation has grown into a major philanthropic vehicle: in 2020, it granted $15 million to 115 organizations, and by 2024, it projected $67 million in grants to 305 nonprofits nationwide. Faulkner intends to steadily expand giving, aiming to distribute $100 million annually by 2027. To responsibly manage the sale of her non-voting Epic shares without destabilizing the company, she established a trust that governs these transactions. This careful planning ensures that her philanthropic mission can continue without affecting Epic’s stability or long-term growth.Epic Systems’ 1,670-acre campus in Wisconsin is far from a conventional office environment. Its 28 buildings feature fantastical themes ranging from Harry Potter and Alice in Wonderland to The Wizard of Oz, organized into mini-campuses such as Prairie Campus, Wizards Academy, and Storybook Campus. Inside, employees help source artwork and whimsical installations, including chocolate chip trails leading to a mock chocolate factory, hanging bridges to treehouses, and magical sculptures scattered across the grounds. This imaginative setting reflects Faulkner’s philosophy that creativity, play, and aesthetic engagement foster learning and productivity, making the workplace not just a location for tasks but a space for inspiration and collaboration.Once a month, Epic employees gather in the underground auditorium called Deep Space for a mandatory meeting affectionately nicknamed “work church.” These gatherings cover essential business news, company updates, and operational targets. Yet Faulkner adds unique elements that transform standard corporate meetings into engaging learning experiences. For instance, she incorporates grammar lessons, teaching employees proper usage of words such as “who” and “whom,” and emphasizing communication skills alongside company strategy. By blending education with corporate updates, these meetings reinforce a culture of continuous learning, intellectual curiosity, and attention to detail, encouraging employees to grow professionally and personally within the company. Her story demonstrates that visionary leadership can redefine both corporate culture and philanthropy on a global scale.Epic Systems is part of a broader trend of companies reimagining office culture to enhance employee engagement. Wellstar Health System, for example, offers wellness rooms with massage chairs, calming music, and healthy snacks, resulting in a 10% drop in employee turnover in 2024. Nonprofit Understood designs offices specifically for neurodivergent employees, with adjustable lighting, temperature zones, and assistive listening systems to support diverse needs. Even CEOs like Jeff Bezos favor “messy meetings” over rehearsed discussions to stimulate open debate and creativity. These examples show that unconventional setups, when thoughtfully implemented, can increase productivity, employee satisfaction, and innovation across industries.While many billionaires sign high-profile pledges without fully following through, Faulkner stands apart as a rare example of commitment and action. By giving away nearly all her wealth through philanthropy, cultivating a creative and educational workplace, and fostering employee engagement through unconventional office design and corporate rituals, she sets a benchmark for responsible, visionary leadership. Her approach demonstrates that a CEO can combine financial success, ethical responsibility, and innovation to create a lasting impact—not just on a company’s bottom line, but on the lives of employees, communities, and society at large. Faulkner’s legacy shows that generosity and innovation are not mutually exclusive but can reinforce each other. Her model inspires future leaders to pursue business success with purpose, creativity, and a commitment to societal well-being.","Ceo judy faulkner gives away nearly all her wealth through roots & wings.

TikTok may be back in India 5 years after ban: Website opens but app unavailable,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tiktok-may-be-back-in-india-5-years-after-ban-website-opens-but-app-unavailable/articleshow/123458272.cms,"Why India banned TikTok in 2020



Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

TikTok website is live in India. After a five-year absence, the Chinese short video app TikTok has sparked excitement among its former Indian user base. The platform's website has become accessible for some users in India, leading to widespread speculation of a potential comeback. However, the app remains unavailable on Google Play Store and App Store, and there is no statement from the company regarding a return.Notably, the move is not without its caveats. While some users have reported being able to access the website, others on X say it remains blocked. When the members of the Times of India tech team checked, they were able to access the homepage but not any other page.When clicked on “Newsroom” a message flashes saying, “You don't have access to this page Our services aren't available in your country or region.” Additionally, a click on “Careers” returns “503 Service Temporarily Unavailable” message. The 'Contacts' link on the page too is opening. It is taking to a page that shows 'Partners', 'Media Enquiries', 'Legal Enquiries' and 'Privacy'.The development has reignited conversations around the 2020 ban. The government initially blocked TikTok along with 58 other Chinese apps, including Shareit and CamScanner, citing national security concerns. The Ministry of Electronics and IT stated that the apps were “prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order.”Meanwhile, TikTok is also facing a ban in the US. However, President Donald Trump has said that he has American buyers ready to acquire TikTok, and he is open to extending the deadline for its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell the app’s US assets.The company is also laying off several employees in the UK and said that this move is part of a “reorganisation” to centralise its operations and increase its reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) for moderation.","Chinese short video app tiktok's website is now live in india.

Bill Gates reveals his winning answer to ‘why should we hire you’ to crack any interview,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-gates-reveals-his-winning-answer-to-why-should-we-hire-you-to-crack-any-interview/articleshow/123405257.cms,"

Bill Gates answers why should we hire you?

What are your strengths and weaknesses?





Where do you see yourself in five years?



What are your salary expectations?





Bill Gates’ final advice

When it comes to cracking a job interview, even the brightest candidates often stumble on the most common questions. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates , who has not only given interviews in his youth but also conducted countless ones as an employer, recently shared how to approach some of the trickiest questions that appear in almost every interview. Gates believes that while technical skills matter, the way candidates express their motivation, adaptability, and problem-solving abilities makes a lasting impression. His advice offers a mix of honesty, preparation, and strategic thinking that can help job seekers stand out in today’s highly competitive hiring environment.Gates emphasizes that this question isn’t about boasting but about clearly communicating your value in a way that resonates with the employer. He explains that hiring managers are not just looking for a list of accomplishments – they want to see how your skills and mindset directly align with the company’s mission and challenges. Instead of giving vague responses like “I work hard” or “I’m a team player,” Gates suggests tailoring your answer to highlight the exact strengths the employer is seeking. For example, if the role demands innovation, a candidate could describe a time when they creatively solved a difficult problem and how that approach could benefit the company.As an example, Gates himself often pointed to his coding achievements, deep passion for software, teamwork skills, and ambition when answering this question during his early career. By showcasing not only what he had already accomplished but also his enthusiasm and hunger to grow, he left interviewers convinced of his long-term potential. He advises modern candidates to take a similar approach: connect your unique skills directly to the company’s needs, show you are motivated to grow with the role, and position yourself as someone who can contribute to both short-term impact and long-term vision.According to Gates, this question is an opportunity for self-awareness rather than self-promotion. He recommends that candidates choose strengths that are relevant to the job while explaining how those qualities have produced real results in the past. On weaknesses, Gates suggests honesty balanced with growth – admitting areas of improvement while showing the steps you are taking to overcome them. This demonstrates maturity and a willingness to learn, qualities employers value highly.Bill Gates’ own answer: Gates admitted that he was not particularly skilled in marketing or sales, but he excelled in product creation and defining features. By acknowledging weaknesses without trying to disguise them, while doubling down on his true strengths, Gates showed the kind of critical self-awareness employers value.Gates points out that this question is less about predicting the future and more about revealing ambition. Employers want to see that candidates have direction and drive. He suggests aligning your career goals with the company’s growth, showing that you want to grow alongside the organization. Even if the long-term vision evolves, demonstrating that you think ahead and are motivated to build a future leaves a strong impression.On this tricky question, Gates advises candidates to strike a balance between confidence and flexibility. Being too rigid about salary can make you seem difficult to work with, while undervaluing yourself may raise doubts about your worth. Gates recommends doing prior research on industry standards and giving a reasonable range instead of a fixed number. He also stresses framing salary discussions in terms of value – how your skills and contributions justify the compensation – while showing openness to negotiation. This demonstrates professionalism and practicality, traits employers respect. In today’s fast-changing job market, Gates’ timeless advice highlights that authenticity, preparation, and adaptability are key. For candidates, mastering these principles can mean the difference between just attending an interview and truly acing it.For Gates, interviews are not just about answering questions but about telling a story – one that highlights your passion, your potential, and your fit with the company’s culture. He encourages candidates to prepare, practice, and remain authentic, reminding them that the goal is not perfection but connection. By framing common questions as opportunities to reveal character and ambition, Gates believes any candidate can turn a stressful interview into a powerful career breakthrough. According to a 2024 LinkedIn Workplace Learning Report, communication, adaptability, and problem-solving rank among the top three skills employers look for in interviews worldwide. Gates reminds candidates that confidence paired with curiosity often leaves a stronger impression than rehearsed answers. Embracing challenges and demonstrating adaptability can set you apart in any competitive interview. Gates believes that the candidates who succeed are those who combine skills with purpose, showing not just what they can do but why they want to do it.","Microsoft co-founder bill gates recently shared how to approach some of the trickiest questions that appear in almost every interview.

What Take Two said about these job cuts



“While we’re excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we’ve made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a BioShock game, and in doing so are reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development,”

WhatsApp Makes Group Calls Smarter

Take-Two Interactive, the parent company of GTA 6 maker Rockstar Games, has laid off more than 80 employees at its Cloud Chamber studio. The job cuts represent about a third of the staff at the studio, which is developing the next instalment in the popular BioShock series. The layoffs, which took place this week, are reportedly part of a broader reorganisation. As a result, the new BioShock game, which was previously expected to be released in late 2026 or early 2027, will now be delayed, a report claims. The move comes after rumours claimed that Cloud Chamber had replaced its studio head and creative director due to development issues.According to a report by Bloomberg, 2K Games, the Take-Two label behind BioShock has confirmed the job cuts but did not disclose how many employees were affected. When asked for comment, a spokesperson pointed to an internal email sent to the studio's staff by 2K President David Ismailer .Ismailer wrote in his statement.The new BioShock has been in development for over a decade, cycling through multiple studios and leadership teams since 2014. After failed attempts with Certain Affinity, 2K formed Cloud Chamber in 2017, bringing in veterans and shifting development to Unreal Engine 5, which extended the timeline, the report notes.Despite promising demos, the project has faced technical hurdles, leadership departures, and narrative issues. Internal reviews deemed it solid but not exceptional, prompting leadership changes. Following layoffs at Cloud Chamber, 2K has appointed industry veteran Rod Fergusson, known as a project “closer,” to help steer the game to completion, the report adds.","Take-two interactive has laid off more than 80 employees at its cloud chamber studio.

TCS responds to the layoffs



Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), India’s largest IT services is presently facing backlash after announcing its plans to layoff around 12000 employees. Layoffs have reportedly led to protests across some cities outside TCS offices. The protests are organised by Union of IT & ITES Employees (UNITE).UNITE also took to social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to post about the protests. “TCS is retrenching workers not out of necessity, but for profit. Targeting senior employees & pushing illegal layoffs is an attack on job security across IT. Workers are not numbers on a balance sheet — we demand justice!” UNITE wrote on X.UNITE supported by the Centre of Indian Trade Unions (CITU), staged demonstrations this week, demanding that TCS reverse its decision and urging government intervention. “Union of IT And ITES Employees protested tofay in Chennai against the announced TCS layoff of 12000 employees and the government inaction,” wrote the Union association in a post shared on X.The union alleges that the layoffs have disproportionately targeted experienced mid-level and senior level professionals. The union also accuse the company of firing professionals with strong performance record and leadership credentials.UNITE is now planning to escalate its campaign globally if the authorise doesn’t act in time.In an official statement the Indian IT services giant TCS said: ""TCS is on a journey to become a future-ready organisation… As part of this journey, we will also be releasing associates from the organisation whose deployment may not be feasible. This will impact about 2% of our global workforce, primarily in the middle and the senior grades, over the course of the year.""This transition is being planned with due care to ensure there is no impact on service delivery to our clients… We understand that this is a challenging time for our colleagues likely to be affected. We thank them for their service and we will be making all efforts to provide appropriate benefits, outplacement, counselling, and support as they transition to new opportunities,” added the company.TCS has also announced that it will give proper benefits, counselling, outplacement and support to the impacted employees.

"Movement signatures: How we move, gesture, use facial expressions is unique; could be as different as fingerprint",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/movement-signatures-how-we-move-gesture-use-facial-expressions-could-be-as-unique-as-fingerprint/articleshow/123483187.cms,"



MANCHESTER: The way someone walks, talks, smiles, or gestures gives a clue to who they are. Whether through the flick of an eyebrow, the rhythm of our walk, or the tilt of a head, movement speaks volumes.And my recent paper shows that people may have their own movement fingerprint. This is a style of movement that is characteristic of a person's identity. So, someone who uses expressive facial gestures might also speak with animated hand movements or walk with a lively gait. These consistencies could form a motion fingerprint that is unique to the individual.First, let's explore how faces move and why this matters.Everyone has their own style of moving their face, for example, how they raise an eyebrow, purse their lips, or squint when laughing. These patterns of movement help us recognise familiar people even when the visual quality is poor, such as in low lighting or from a distance. And as a person becomes more familiar to us, we become tuned to the way they move, learning their unique patterns of motion, just like we remember their face or voice.Human faces are constantly in motion; they blink, smile, grimace and talk, to name a few movements. Researchers categorise facial motion into rigid movements (such as turning or nodding the head) and non-rigid movements (like expressing emotion or speaking). It's the non-rigid movements that tend to be most personally distinctive.The way we gesture with our hands, shift our posture and tilt our heads all carry identity information. Gestures are often shaped by personal habits or cultural norms; for example, someone might habitually nod three times when agreeing, or use a distinctive hand wave common in their home country.Facial movements are synchronised with the way we sound. When we talk, our face plays a role in shaping the sound of our voice. For example, if you talk with a wide open mouth, your speech sounds deeper and richer. Studies show that people can match other people's voices to moving faces more accurately than to static ones. This suggests that dynamic cues to identity are present in the movement of the face and the sound of the voice.People with face recognition difficulties (those who are ""face blind"" or prosopagnosic) may be better at recognising moving faces than still ones. Typically, people who are face blind can see faces and the differences between them, but struggle to link the face to a specific person. Here, idiosyncratic information from movement can provide an additional clue to identity.Gait, a person's walking style, is one of the most studied body movements. Early research, such as a 2005 study, investigated participants' recognition of identity from gait using point-light displays. In this case, bright spots (lights) were placed on key areas of a person's body. All other visual cues were removed. Participants could only see bright spots against a dark background. The study found participants could tell fairly well who someone was from the way the spots moved.Characteristics such as stride length, limb movement, posture and pace form a consistent motion pattern that is unique and surprisingly difficult to fake, making gait analysis a reliable clue for identifying people.Movement fingerprintsMy review brought together evidence from behavioural and brain imaging studies to consider if such consistencies between different types of motion exist and how we might explore this phenomenon further. The paper proposes that people have an overall style of movement.More work needs to be done to find direct evidence of movement fingerprints. For example, we still aren't sure what part of the brain processes these movement-based identity cues.So far, research shows that the posterior temporal sulcus - an area of the brain located roughly above your ear on each side - responds not just to faces and bodies, but to how someone moves more generally. This area is active when we hear voices or see people speak, suggesting it may help link motion and sound. Also, this region plays a key role in allowing us to understand our social world, interpreting other people's actions, determining where they are looking, and picking up on social cues such as gestures, facial expressions and changes in gaze direction.However, it's probably just one part of a larger brain network involved in recognising others through motion.Real-world applicationsMotion-based identity traits aren't as stable or specific as fingerprints or DNA. They're what researchers call soft biometrics: useful but not always accurate.But as we better understand the link between motion and identity, exciting real-world applications are emerging.Motion analysis could support contactless identity verification from gait-based authentication at airports to gesture-based identification in smart environments, such as homes that respond to a user's unique movement patterns. In clinical settings, movement analysis might help support people with social cognition impairments, face recognition or movement issues. For example, helping a doctor identify changes in the way a patient produces non-verbal cues.But many questions remain. We still aren't sure how consistent motion fingerprints are as someone gets older and in different contexts. Individual differences in people and environmental factors like lighting, clothing or stress could affect them.Researchers also aren't sure how exactly we manage to understand all this movement in everyday life without even thinking about it.Figuring this out could not only help improve technologies like social robots and develop tools for people with recognition and communication difficulties, but also tell us more about how we process and react to other people. (The Conversation) RD RD","The way we gesture with our hands, shift our posture and tilt our heads all carry identity information. Gestures are often shaped by personal habits or cultural norms. People with face recognition difficulties (those who are ""face blind"" or prosopagnosic) may be better at recognising moving faces.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123483213,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1212831,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Britain agrees to drop mandate for Apple to provide 'back door',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/britain-agrees-to-drop-mandate-for-apple-to-provide-back-door/articleshow/123395824.cms,"Representative Image





SAN FRANCISCO: The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Britain to spare Apple from a request that the company create a tool to give British law enforcement organisations access to customers' cloud data.Tulsi Gabbard, US director of national intelligence, said Monday night that Britain had ""agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties.""Britain's decision to back off the policy comes after Apple spent months lobbying officials in Washington and rolled back an encrypted storage feature for British users. In the face of govt pressure around the world, the company has been resolute that it won't create a back door that allows access to phones or encrypted user data because it is afraid such a tool could be abused.Much of Apple's predicament in Britain played out in private after the govt issued a secret order this year. The request came after Britain amended its Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which allows it to compel companies to turn over data and communications to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Apple helped make the secret order public by declaring in Feb that iPhone users in Britain would begin seeing messages on their phones saying the company no longer offered its Advanced Data Protection feature. The capability, which remained available in the US, had allowed British users to encrypt almost all of their iCloud data, including messages,notes, photos and backups.Gabbard said Britain's agreement would ""ensure Americans' private data remains private and our Constitutional rights and civil liberties are protected."" nyt",Britain drops mandate for apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of american citizens.
