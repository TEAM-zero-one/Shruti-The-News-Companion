ISRO Launches Heaviest-Ever Satellite BlueBird Block-2 Onboard LVM3 Rocket

SRIHARIKOTA: India’s heavy-lift rocket LVM3 on Wednesday successfully placed the US communications satellite- BlueBird Block-2 - into low Earth orbit, in an early morning launch mission. At 6100kg, it was the heaviest payload lifted by the rocket which completed its sixth operational flight and third dedicated commercial mission. Isro chairman V Narayanan said LVM3 rocket achieved an orbit of 518.5km against the planned 520km orbit.""This is the heaviest satellite to be launched by an Indian launcher in Indian soil. This is also the first back to back LVM3 launch missions within a period of 52days. With this, Isro has placed 434 satellites for 34 countries.""The 43.5m tall and 640tonne rocket lifted off from the Second Launch Pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota. About 16 minutes after liftoff, BlueBird Block-2 was injected into a circular orbit at an altitude of around 520km with an inclination of 53degrees.The mission, designated LVM3-M6, was undertaken as part of a commercial agreement between NewSpace India Limited (NSIL), the commercial arm of Isro, and US-based AST & Science LLC.BlueBird Block-2 is part of a global low Earth orbit constellation aimed at enabling direct-to-mobile satellite connectivity.According to mission details, the satellite features a 223 square metre phased-array antenna, making it the largest commercial communications satellite deployed in low Earth orbit. The constellation is designed to support 4G and 5G voice and video calls, video streaming, text messaging and data services directly on standard mobile phones, without the need for specialised ground equipment.","At 6100kg, it was the heaviest payload lifted by the rocket.

Kunal Kushwaha, an Indian-origin tech educator and developer advocate, shared a personal account of the limits he says come with holding an Indian passport while working globally. In a viral post on X, Kushwaha described how visa rules and paperwork often disrupt his travel plansAfter a recent trip to Berlin, Kushwaha said he was unable to travel to Ireland to surprise his best friend on his birthday because there was not enough time to apply for another visa. What should have been a simple decision, booking a flight, instead turned into hours spent navigating visa websites. The episode, he wrote, showed how routine travel can become unnecessarily complicated.In his post, Kushwaha described standing in long airport queues while other travellers passed through quickly. He said he often carries folders of documents he has already submitted many times. Schengen visa applications, he added, feel like a full-time job. They require bank statements, cover letters and detailed explanations for ordinary trips.“I’m not angry. I’m tired,” he wrote. Kushwaha stressed that his frustration is practical rather than emotional.He said national pride does not reduce the mental effort needed to deal with constant paperwork.The post also pointed to wider questions about passport strength. India ranks low on global mobility indexes and offers visa-free access to relatively few destinations. Kushwaha argued that these rankings translate into real constraints for professionals who travel frequently for work, conferences and collaboration.Many replies to his post shared similar experiences. Users posted stories of delayed appointments, short visa validity periods and uncertainty even for repeat travellers with established international careers.Kushwaha also touched on issues beyond travel. He said investments made in India had lost value over time because of the rupee’s decline. He also mentioned air pollution and outdated banking and KYC processes as factors that add to everyday friction.","Kunal kushwaha, an indian-origin tech educator and developer advocate, shared a personal account of the limits he says come with holding an indian passport.

Bluebird Lift-Off Shows ISRO Commercial Power As Nambi Narayanan Calls LVM-3 Game Changer Move

The Indian Space Research Organisation ( Isro ) on Wednesday released rare onboard camera footage from its heaviest rocket, LVM3-M6, offering a rocket’s-eye view of the BlueBird Block-2 mission from liftoff to satellite separation.The footage shared by Isro on X features visuals captured by cameras onboard and documents each major phase of the ascent. The footage shows the rocket lifting off from the second launch pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, followed by the separation of the twin S200 solid strap-on boosters. It then captures the separation of the L110 liquid core stage and the jettisoning of the payload fairing, before concluding with the successful separation of the BlueBird Block-2 satellite into Low Earth Orbit.The visuals were recorded during Isro’s successful commercial launch of the next-generation US communication satellite for AST SpaceMobile earlier in the day. The 6,100 kg satellite was placed into its intended orbit at an altitude of about 520 km, approximately 15 minutes after launch.The 43.5-metre-tall LVM3 lifted off at 8.55 am after the completion of a 24-hour countdown. Powered by two S200 solid boosters, a liquid core stage and a cryogenic upper stage, the rocket performed all mission events as planned.The space agency said the mission, designated LVM3-M6, marked the sixth operational flight of the LVM3 launch vehicle, nicknamed ‘Bahubali’ for its heavy-lift capability. The Isro chief, Dr V Narayanan, described the mission’s success as a “season’s gift” to the country.BlueBird Block-2 is part of a Low Earth Orbit constellation being developed by US-based AST SpaceMobile. The satellite is designed to enable direct-to-mobile connectivity, providing 4G and 5G voice and video calls, text messaging, streaming and data services directly to standard mobile smartphones.Developed by Isro, the three-stage LVM3 has a lift-off mass of 640 tonnes and a payload capability of 4,200 kg to Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit.

ISRO’s Heaviest Launch Yet: Five Reasons Why BlueBird-2 Marks India’s Big Leap In Global Space Race

SRIHARIKOTA: Baahubali sent BlueBird to the heavens. India’s space ambitions gained new heights and heft. Isro capped 2025 with a flawless heavy-lift statement Wednesday, as its LVM3 rocket — nicknamed Baahubali — hurled the US communications satellite BlueBird Block-2 into low Earth orbit, the heaviest spacecraft ever launched from Indian soil.The lift-off came from the second launch pad at Sriharikota at 8.55 am, delayed by a minute to sidestep space debris. Fifteen minutes later, precision prevailed. The 6,100kg satellite was injected into a near-perfect circular orbit, marking another clean chapter for India’s human-rated launcher.The mission extended LVM3’s unbroken streak to nine consecutive successes — a milestone that sharpens confidence for the Gaganyaan human spaceflight programme and signals India’s arrival as a serious player in the global LEO communications market.Isro chairman V Narayanan called it a standout flight on multiple fronts. The launcher achieved orbital accuracy of less than 1.5km, placing BlueBird at 518.9km against a target of 520km — the best performance by an Indian rocket to date. “With nine consecutive successful LVM3 launches, our confidence in the Gaganyaan mission has significantly increased,” Narayanan said.Beyond mass and accuracy, the launch carried historical weight.It marked Isro’s 434th satellite deployment for 34 countries across 45 years, and the first back-to-back LVM3 mission, executed with a turnaround of just 52 days.Technological upgrades pushed the rocket further. Payload capability rose by more than 150kg after electro-hydraulic actuators were replaced with electro-mechanical systems to control the massive S200 booster motors. “With additional technologies, we have demonstrated that Isro is in a much better position for future missions, including Gaganyaan,” said mission director T Victor Joseph.The flight underscored rising commercial momentum. P Mohan, acting chairman and MD of Isro’s commercial arm NewSpace India Ltd, said interest in the launcher is accelerating. “There is interest for six to 10 LVM3 missions annually, with several global companies seeking up to six launches per year from 2026–27 onwards,” he said.Wednesday’s mission, designated LVM3-M6, was flown under a commercial agreement between NSIL and US-based AST & Science LLC. BlueBird Block-2 forms part of a global LEO constellation designed to deliver direct-to-mobile 4G and 5G connectivity.Shanti Gupta, chief operating officer of AST SpaceMobile, said the company aims to deploy 45 to 60 satellites by the end of 2026 for worldwide coverage and is in talks with space agencies across the globe, including Isro.Industry voices framed the launch as a strategic inflection point. Space Industry Association of India president Subba Rao said India now stands among a select group capable of reliably deploying heavy-class LEO payloads for next-generation telecom networks.“Its significance lies not just in launch success, but in what it signals about India’s industrial readiness, reliability, and ability to support constellations at scale over time,” he said.Indian Space Association director general Lt Gen (retd) AK Bhatt described the mission as a quantum leap. “It exemplifies Isro’s engineering excellence and operational maturity, enabling heavier payloads for global satellite constellations,” he said.“The mission strengthens India’s self-reliance in launch services and positions Isro as a preferred provider for international missions, while accelerating growth across the domestic space ecosystem.”As Baahubali faded into the morning sky, the message lingered on Earth: India is no longer testing the limits of heavy lift — it is defining them.",Isro delivers its heaviest punch as bahubali puts bluebird into orbit.

'Best Time To Invest, Innovate And Make In India': PM Narendra Modi

NEW DELHI: Rahul Gandhi's praise for ""transformative"" job creation in Karnataka led I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw Wednesday to assert that it was an acknowledgement of the success of PM Narendra Modi's 'Make in India' programme.He said on X, ""Thanks Rahul Gandhi for acknowledging the success of PM Modi's 'Make in India' programme. As you have noted, we are becoming a producer economy as we implement our PM's vision.""In a recent social media post, the LoP in Lok Sabha had cited a news report to highlight the hiring of 30,000 staff in 8-9 months, the fastest factor ramp-up seen in India so far, by Foxconn in the Congress-ruled Karnataka.Rahul had said, ""It is transformative job creation. What makes it even more powerful is that the unit is largely women-led, with around 80% women, most aged 19-24, and for many, this is their first job. Karnataka is setting an example by creating an ecosystem where manufacturing can grow at this scale and speed. This is India we must build: jobs with dignity, and opportunities for all.""Officials pointed out that it was during Covid that the Modi government, tapping into the widespread recognition to diversify supply chains, nudged Apple's vendors, including Foxconn, to shift significant parts of their manufacturing operations from China. The nudge often resembled a covert operation as Beijing sought to block reshoring. At the time, it was a BJP government in Karnataka and Centre's production linked incentives played a major role as it provided sops to mobile manufacturers. The government followed it up with incentives for electronic components.Since then Foxconn has bolstered its operations in the country with a large presence in Tamil Nadu and is also looking at facilities in UP.","Rahul gandhi's praise for ""transformative"" job creation in karnataka led i&b minister ashwini vaishnaw wednesday to assert that it was an acknowledgement of the success of pm narendra modi's 'make in india' programme.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126166489,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-610560,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

ISRO’s Heaviest Launch Yet: Five Reasons Why BlueBird-2 Marks India’s Big Leap In Global Space Race

NEW DELHI: PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday congratulated Isro after its ‘Bahubali’ rocket LVM-M6 successfully placed US’s new-generation BlueBird Block-2 communication satellite, weighing 6,100 kg, into orbit.It was the heaviest payload to be placed into the low earth orbit (LEO) in LVM3’s launch history -- the previous heaviest was the LVM3-M5 communication satellite 03, weighing about 4,400 kg, that was placed into the geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO) on November 2.“A significant stride in India’s space sector. The successful LVM3-M6 launch, placing the heaviest satellite ever launched from Indian soil, the spacecraft of USA, BlueBird Block-2, into its intended orbit, marks a proud milestone in India's space journey,"" PM Modi said in a post on X.The mission marks the 6th operational flight of the LVM3 launch vehicle. It also represents a significant leap in telecommunications technology, as the US payload is designed to provide high-speed 4G and 5G connectivity directly to smartphones.BlueBird Block-2 is the second important US satellite launch from India this year after the Indo-US joint mission’s NISAR, the world’s costliest (around $1.5 billion) and most advanced Earth-imaging satellite.As of late Dec 2025, Isro has launched at least 234 satellites for the US.Since 2015, when India launched the first commercial US satellites on board PSLV-C30, American satellites make up the largest portion of the total 434 foreign satellites launched by Isro, contributing significantly to the nearly $143 million in foreign exchange revenue generated by these launches.Space minister Jitendra Singh also congratulated Isro on the successful launch. ""I think it is the moment of glory for the country. It has been possible because of the progress of the last 10 to 12 years (under the PM Narendra Modi-led government).Even though the American satellites were being launched from Sriharikota earlier as well, today's launch has demonstrated to the world that we have the capacity to launch a satellite as heavy as 6,000 kgs,"" he said.Placing a 6-tonne-class satellite into LEO is significant because payload mass has become a key indicator for constellation efficiency in the direct-to-device and hybrid satellite-terrestrial era. Heavier satellites enable higher payload consolidation, fewer orbital assets, simplified phasing, and lower per-user costs when serving mass-market connectivity.From an operator’s perspective, this reduces both capital intensity and operational complexity. India’s demonstrated ability to support such missions meaningfully alters how global satcom players model constellation architecture, insurance exposure, and launch diversification.Commenting on the broader significance, Subba Rao, president of Space Industry Association India, said: “This mission demonstrates that India is now part of the core commercial LEO deployment landscape. The importance lies not only in launch success, but in what it signals about India’s industrial readiness, reliability, and ability to support constellations at scale over time. That confidence is what global operators ultimately build programmes around. ”Several industrial units from the Indian private industry have contributed significantly to LVM3 rocket success.Ananth Technologies Pvt Ltd (ATL), a long-standing partner of the Indian Space Programme, said, 'It is proud to have contributed to this historic mission"". ""ATL has been closely associated with the LVM3 programme and has delivered critical flight hardware, avionics systems, electronics, and precision subsystems that play a vital role in mission success,"" a company statement said.","Pm narendra modi congratulated isro after its ‘bahubali’ rocket lvm-m6 successfully placed us’s new-generation bluebird block-2 communication satellite.

Shane McMahon’s WWE legacy and wealth creation

Business ventures and Marissa Mazzola-McMahon’s role

Shane McMahon and Marissa Mazzola-McMahon, who both served as WWE Producer/Director, are worth a combined $650 million, the result of decades spent near one of sports entertainment’s most influential families and a carefully curated soon-to-branch portfolio beyond the ring. Shane, as a key McMahon heir, has had his financial profile associated with WWE's ascendance to a worldwide media conglomerate for decades, while Marissa's career has been largely away from the limelight.Their fortune, collectively, is uneven but complementary at best. The vast bulk of the couple's wealth originates from Shane, who owns most of the couple's cash, investments, and property, as Marissa’s professional income and personal assets serve to augment, not scale, the family nest-egg. Rumors in the financial, as well as the gossip and entertainment worlds, have put their collective net gross at around $205 million by the year 2025, but the numbers are tightly held secret from the outside world and media.Even hooks have different weights, and for Shane McMahon, his financial foundation came from WWE, where he served in various capacities as an executive, on-camera talent, and brand representative.He was in charge when WWE became a publicly traded, globally syndicating corporation, a transition that paid senior insiders in the form of salaries, bonuses and equity-linked pay. Shane also became recognized over the years for the insane, risk-taking, high impact, physical matches that elevated his brand and worth.Overall, Shane's net worth is often assumed to be around $200 million in the year 2025 as an individual. That number includes years of WWE and associated earnings, assets from the McMahon family estate, and WWE-affiliated corporate relationships. Although he was never as high on the control totem pole as his old man, Vince, his standing in the company meant he was around some significant cash decisions in WWE's most successful years.Shane McMahon has built up a portfolio of separate business interests away from the world of WWE, with a particular focus on technology, media, and emerging industries in the United States. He has been chairman and advisor to a number of companies, as part of the indication that he might be looking to diversify beyond wrestling-related income. They have not always been runaway headline-grabbers, but all together they build up his overall financial footprint and his long game for the long haul.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Less dramatic is the financial story of Marissa Mazzola-McMahon.

The two most important things in Philip Rivers’ life are family and football preparation

After more than 17 years in the NFL with the San Diego Chargers, Los Angeles Chargers, and Indianapolis Colts, eight-time Pro Bowler and NFL Comeback Player of the Year Philip Rivers has over 63,000 passing yards, 400 touchdowns, and a passer rating of 95.1.At 44, Rivers surprised everyone by coming out of retirement to play for his former team and the late Jim Irsay’s Colts. Now, two games into the 2025 season, he has amassed over 397 passing yards, three touchdowns, and a passer rating of 86.6.Rivers’ drive as a quarterback remains strong on the gridiron. What about his mode of transportation? What about his car collection? Two vehicles reportedly fill his garage: a 2008 Ford F-150 [some reports say F-250] and a Cadillac Escalade SUV. The customized SUV costs about $200,000, while his everyday Ford’s estimated cost is not publicly disclosed. Let’s take a closer look at them.Francisco Cruz of Ford Authority reported in April 2020, that despite earning $215 million as an NFL quarterback, Philip Rivers is driving a 2008 Ford F-150 pickup truck. Rivers drives a heavy-duty truck that is almost 17 years old now. The multi-millionaire star’s primary vehicle boasts a towing capacity over 9,000 pounds and has a 5.4L Triton V8 engine with 300 horsepower and 365 pound-feet of torque.It can easily carry six people. Higher-end model features include powered and heated leather seating, dual-zone automatic climate control, entertainment options such as a CD or DVD system, a large center console, and folding rear seats for cargo flexibility. In September 2017, Kevin Acee of the San Deigo Union-Tribune reported that Rivers’ primary mode of transportation is a 2008 Ford F-250.The second vehicle to catch attention is a Cadillac Escalade SUV. Rivers contacted the makers of high-end vehicles for Hollywood elites like Dr. Dre, Stevie Wonder Jerry Seinfeld , and Barbra Streisand . Reportedly costing close to $200,000, the SUV was customized by Becker Automotive Design in Oxnard, California, in 2017. Amenities include a 40-inch TV, refrigerator, two captain seats with Rivers’ No. 17 on one headrest, satellite TV, wireless internet, a fresh-air ventilation system, a professional quality sound system, and electric leg extensions.Rivers spoke about the SUV with the San Diego Union-Tribune in 2017. “My two biggest things were my family time and my preparation and what I owe this football team,” Rivers said. “I was not going to sacrifice either of them in any big proportion. I can look at all the pluses and minuses and say, ‘Okay, this does it.’This allows me to get home in six to seven hours, which is when I got home the last 11 years, and it allows me to watch all or more of the film I watched before. I don’t want it to be - he’s stuck in a car all day, maybe that’s why he struggled.” The father of ten may be currently using this Cadillac Escalade to prepare for Colts’ matchups.According to Spotrac, Rivers’ career earnings total $244.2 million as of December 2025. He signed a one-year, $1.255 million contract with the Indianapolis Colts for the 2025 season.

How Much Will Lane Hutson Cost the Habs? | Daily Faceoff LIVE

Montreal Canadiens defenseman Lane Hutson’s 2025 net worth explained



Lane Hutson is a defensive player who plays and represents the Montreal Canadiens as an American-Canadian; however, he has swiftly attracted notice in the NHL because of his ability, sight, and assists. Selected 62nd overall in the 2022 NHL Entry Draft, Hutson immediately found his way on the Canadiens roster, with maturity beyond his years. His offensive nature and capability to play on the power play as well as in the normal defense game have made him a key to the future plans of the Montreal team.By 2025, the net worth of Lane Hutson will be based mostly on the hockey earnings. It is the last year of his three-year entry contract with the Canadiens, which has a maximum salary of 950,000 as a cap expenditure in the next 2025-26 season. This contract was small in relation to the experienced NHL players. However, it was the basis of his financial skyrocket as his performance was still astonishing to both the management and the fans.In October 2025, Hutson announced a major eight-year extension to his contract worth up to $70.8 million, beginning in 2026-27. The agreement also has a huge signing bonus of 55 million dollars, which offers the immediate financial security in addition to the confidence of the Canadiens in his value with regard to the long-term.Hutson is playing in the ranks of better-paid defensemen of his age in the NHL, as this contract has an average annual value of $8.85 million.In addition to his contracts, Hutson is likely to have the net worth increased by the possible endorsements and sponsorships, but their numbers are not publicly available. With his increased profile in the league, all these off-ice opportunities will play a key role in his financial portfolio. Upon the expiration of his latest contract extension, Hutson is projected to have made over $73 million in his career; this puts him on the list of the NHL's emerging financial and athletic superstars.Those who are used to news reports and updates of the NHL matches, trade speculations, and news releases are expected to hear a lot of the Hutson name amidst the hockey team as the central figure of the Montreal Canadiens. The year 2025 turns out to be a defining year both in his career and financially, since he is building up on the ice and earning more off the ice.Also Read: Net worth of Auston Matthews in 2025: Details on Toronto Maple Leafs captain's earnings, salary, and contracts","Montreal canadiens defenseman lane hutson’s 2025 net worth explained.

Before returning to WWE, she spent productive years collecting checks from Impact Wrestling plus various independent bookings across the country.Outside the ring, she lands brand partnerships and media spots because her big personality draws companies looking for lively spokespeople.All those pieces working together help Chelsea maintain a healthy and steadily climbing bank account in today's wrestling landscape.Matt Cardona took a bold step, leaving WWE behind and turning himself into one of the most successful independent wrestlers currently active. He collects multiple title belts from promotions like GCW, NWA, and others which drives higher booking fees and bigger crowds to his shows.His merchandise line explodes because supporters love grabbing items that celebrate his ""Indy God"" nickname and unique artwork. On top of that, he earns extra cash through podcast episodes and social media content that fans watch and support regularly.

Torrie Wilson’s WWE legacy and long-term earnings

Justin Tupper’s business career and investment footprint

Torrie Wilson and Justin Tupper are often described as a low-key power couple of WWE, balancing a legacy sports-entertainment career with modern digital media leadership. While Wilson is a well-known name around the world in wrestling circles, Tupper has flown a bit under the radar in the business of sports and content platforms.Uniting as a couple, their 2025 net worth speaks to both prudent career choices, diversified income sources, and a life of relatively low pomp and circumstance. Instead of bombastic and excessive numbers and stories, their financial narrative thrives through longevity, strategy, and continual relevancy.Another notable entry on the list is Torrie Wilson, who racked up her wealth in the early 2000s, which is viewed as the peak of WWE's commercial success. Without a doubt, one of the most recognisable Divas in company history, the television contracts, pay-per-view bonuses, merchandise royalties, modelling opportunities, and other ventures outside of wrestling all accumulated over the years. She also snatched up mainstream magazine covers, including shots in fitness and lifestyle magazines, which only increased her earning power.Wilson continued his earnings through WWE Legends deals as well as convention and Hall of Fame appearances, even after walking away from full-time wrestling.However, in recent years, she has earned an income with social media partnerships and fitness brand collaborations. Her personal net worth by 2025 is estimated to be anywhere around $2 million, a number not so much created by in-ring work at that point but rather from the appropriate use of a well-maintained brand.Yet Justin Tupper’s earning power from a different professional world also adds immensely to the couple’s overall wealth. Tupper took advantage of early trends in direct-to-consumer sports media as the founder of Revolution Golf, a digital golf instruction and commerce platform. His company's being purchased and absorbed into a greater media universe was a seminal financial moment of his professional life.After the success, Tupper had moved into senior management positions in tech firms that serviced sports and entertainment firms, earning a salary and long-term incentives on an ongoing basis. His net worth is probably not public knowledge, but as a benchmark for startup executives at his level with founder exits, the assets are in the low-to-mid seven-figure range. His financial profile consists of business equity rather than salary to be reinvested, rather than being a random celebrity income.Also Read: Trish Stratus and Ron Fisico combined net worth in 2025: WWE legacy, fitness ventures, and family wealth","Torrie wilson and justin tupper are a low-key power couple of wwe.

Drew McIntyre and Kaitlyn Frohnapfel are a fresh and new power couple, the clan moulded by a generation of elite sport, regimented lifestyle, and lifestyle strategy.

Though exact figures are not available to the public, industry estimates and career milestones offer a solid understanding of how championship wrestling, fitness labor, product endorsements, and personal lifestyle decisions create their net worth.WWE's top-earning superstars, Drew McIntyre, are loaded up from a guaranteed contract first as long-time top performers with WWE. Wrestlers of his caliber frequently enjoy a lucrative baseline, then add on additional income from performance bonuses given out at premium live events, television main events, and merchandise. A multi-time world champion, fan favorite in other countries, and frequent television appearances earn McIntyre a spot in the top tier of WWE income earners.In addition to his in-ring salary, McIntyre gets a cut of merchandise sales, royalties from licensing deals, and paid appearances.Annual earnings also get pumped up through likeness rights related to video games and promotional work. Even the most lowball of estimates has McIntyre worth several million dollars, both individually and cumulatively, by 2025, built over time rather than via one-off lottery tickets.Kaitlyn Frohnapfel lives very much under the radar, but definitely contributes to the household in her own way. A former college athlete and kinesiology/fitness trainer by profession, she has always worked in health and wellness arenas concerned with sustainability rather than celebrity. It is assumed that she earns profits from fitness coaching, wellness consulting, and a few brand collaborations instead of endorsing mass brands.Considering Drew McIntyre's WWE income history plus everything Frohnapfel has earned over the years while working as a professional, the most realistic estimates of their combined wealth place it somewhere between roughly $3 million and $10 million.Also Read: Torrie Wilson and Justin Tupper combined net worth in 2025: WWE history, investments, and lifestyle","Wwe's top-earning superstars, drew mcintyre and kaitlyn frohnapfel, are loaded up from a guaranteed contract first as long-time top performers with wwe.

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon musk has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

“probably never have kids,”

“sad”

MrBeast weighs in as Valkyrae discourse takes over social media amid kids and motherhood debate

“who cares, she can do what she wants, it has 0 impact on us.”





Valkyrae recently found herself at the center of online controversy after a short clip from one of her streams went viral on social media. In the clip, the popular streamer said that for the rest of her life she willfocus on playing video games, stay attractive, and continue making money. She framed the comment as a personal preference and a reflection of where she sees her life heading. However, the clip quickly became a talking point across platforms like X, drawing strong reactions from both critics and supporters.As the clip spread, many users began offering opinions on Valkyrae’s choices, with some calling her outlookor predicting she would end up lonely. Others defended her right to choose a career-focused life without marriage or children. The debate soon moved beyond Valkyrae herself and turned into a broader argument about women, motherhood, and what society expects from successful women. This reaction also followed a familiar pattern, as Valkyrae has previously sparked similar debates whenever she has discussed kids or family on stream in past years.Amid the growing discourse, MrBeast reacted to one of the viral posts discussing Valkyrae’s comments.Rather than taking a strong position for or against her lifestyle, he criticized the outrage itself.Responding to the debate, MrBeast wrote that he was tired of seeing posts about it and questioned why it mattered at all. In his words,His response echoed a wider frustration with how personal choices often turn into public arguments online.MrBeast’s response changed the tone of the conversation. Instead of people picking apart Valkyrae’s personal choice, his take made many step back and ask a bigger question, why did her private plans become such a huge public debate in the first place? A lot of users agreed with him, saying that decisions about having children are incredibly personal and not something random strangers online should be weighing in on.What started as a simple comment from Valkyrae about her own life quickly turned into a reminder of how easily the internet can turn private choices into public controversy. MrBeast’s reaction cut through that noise, pointing out that not every viral moment needs a moral judgment and that some decisions truly only matter to the person making them.Also Read: Who was Epic Gamer Grandma?
