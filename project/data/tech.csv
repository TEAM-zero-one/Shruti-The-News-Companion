Delhi’s Air Pollution Gets Attention, But Most Indian Cities Are As Bad Or Worse | I Witness

NEW DELHI: Taking, in what it called, an important step towards environmental governance and reducing dependence on foreign certification systems, India has set up the world’s second National Environmental Standard Laboratory here at the CSIR–National Physical Laboratory (NPL) that will develop requisite testing and calibration facilities for air pollution monitoring equipment in the country.Currently, most of the instruments used in India for air pollution monitoring are imported. These imported instruments, however, come with production certification from international agencies based on the environmental conditions of the certificate issuing countries.Since environmental conditions of those countries are very different from the conditions prevalent in India, it affects the quality of measurements by the instrument operating for a long time in Indian conditions, CSIR scientists explained. At present, only the UK has such a laboratory.The National Environmental Standard Laboratory, inaugurated by Union science & technology minister Jitendra Singh on 80th Foundation Day celebrations of CSIR–NPL on Monday, will now not only deal with the anomaly arising out of different environmental conditions but also help in manufacturing of standardised monitoring equipment.Domestic production of such instruments will eventually end India’s dependence on import and make it an exporting nation of such equipment to third world countries.The global market value of air pollution monitoring systems is, currently, estimated at $3,997 million.In addition, Singh also inaugurated the National Primary Standard Facility for Solar Cell Calibration, bringing India among a select group of global leaders in photovoltaic measurement standards. Both these facilities will enhance trust in data and drive investment in pollution monitoring and renewable energy.Describing the National Environmental Standard Laboratory as a “critical step towards strengthening India’s environmental governance framework”, Singh said that reliable, India-specific calibration and certification of air pollution monitoring systems was long overdue and would now enable transparent, traceable, and accurate environmental data.The facility will support regulatory bodies, industries, and startups by ensuring that monitoring instruments are tested under Indian climatic conditions. It will thus improve policy enforcement of various schemes including the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP).Terming the facility for Solar Cell Calibration (Solar Energy Complex) a “future-ready facility”, Singh said it would reduce India’s dependence on foreign certification agencies, save foreign exchange, shorten turnaround time for calibration, and enhance investor confidence in the country’s rapidly expanding solar sector.","India has set up the world’s second national environmental standard laboratory.

"In a 1st in world, Army set to deploy ramjet-powered shells for 155mm artillery guns",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/in-a-1st-in-world-army-set-to-deploy-ramjet-powered-shells-for-155mm-artillery-guns/articleshow/126330397.cms,"From Missiles To Torpedoes, DRDO Outlines India’s Big Defence Push For Near-Term Battlefield Edge

NEW DELHI: The Indian Army is on the cusp of becoming the world’s first armed force to operationally deploy ramjet-powered artillery shells for its 155 mm guns. The advanced technology, developed in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras and with support of Army Technology Board (ATB), is now under trial.Ramjet propulsion is not new and has been used in missiles worldwide. However, applying the technology to artillery shells is a revolutionary step.Professors P A Ramakrishna and S Verma from IIT Madras' Department of Aerospace Engineering co-developed a ramjet-powered artillery shell after years of research. The technology, developed under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, is designed to significantly extend the reach of standard tube artillery.Prof Ramakrishna recently explained that a ramjet operates as an air-breathing engine that does not require turbines or compressors. It relies on the shell being launched to speeds of approx Mach 2 using an artillery gun. At this velocity, air entering the engine is naturally compressed, fuel is ignited and thrust is produced, which allows the shell to maintain propulsion and significantly extend its range.“Being an air-breathing engine, ramjet has higher specific impulse (ISP) (> 4000 N s/kg) compared to that of a solid rocket (~2500 N s/kg) and, therefore, provides much higher overall impulse to the shell for the same mass of propellant,” the IIT-M research paper said.One of the key challenges IIT-M team faced was using ramjet to have high combustion efficiency with restricted secondary combustor length. However, the team managed to overcome this obstacle.The technology promises to extend the range of conventional artillery shells by 30% to 50% while maintaining their destructive power. By integrating ramjet technology into 155 mm shells, the Army obtained the ability to strike deeper targets with greater effectiveness. Developmental trials are currently under way, with successful tests already conducted at the Pokhran field firing ranges. These trials have demonstrated the feasibility of retrofitting ramjet modules onto existing 155 mm shells, meaning the technology can be applied across the Army’s current inventory without requiring entirely new ammunition designs.Once the ramjet artillery shell technology is ready for induction, it can be used in any of the Army’s artillery systems, including on the US-imported M777 ultra-light howitzer.","The indian army is on the cusp of becoming the world’s first armed force to operationally deploy ramjet-powered artillery shells for its 155 mm guns.

Red Fort blast: Probe unveils how terrorists spoke to Pakistani handlers - What's a 'ghost' SIM card?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/red-fort-blast-probe-unveils-how-terrorists-spoke-to-pakistani-handlers-whats-a-ghost-sim-card/articleshow/126333192.cms,"Representative image

Massive Car Explosion Near Delhi’s Red Fort Hours After Faridabad Terror Plot bust, Many Dead

The ‘dual-phone’ playbook

A disturbing trend

How does the government plan to tackle this?

The

white-collar terror module

NEW DELHI: Investigations into the blast near Delhi’s Red Fort on November 10 last year have revealed how a ""white-collar"" terror module relied on a sophisticated network of “ghost” SIM cards and encrypted messaging apps to stay in touch with Pakistani handlers.The accused, many of them highly educated doctors, used illegally obtained or fraudulently issued SIM cards and multiple mobile devices to evade surveillance.The findings of this probe subsequently became the basis for a sweeping directive issued by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) on November 28, mandating that app-based communication services such as WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal must remain continuously linked to an active physical SIM card installed in the device.A “ghost” SIM card is a mobile connection that is illegally issued or fraudulently activated without being linked to the actual user, security officials said. Such SIMs are typically obtained using forged or misused identity documents, including Aadhaar details of unsuspecting civilians, or through bulk activations that bypass verification norms.Investigators say these numbers allow criminals and terror operatives to communicate and use encrypted messaging applications while remaining largely untraceable, posing a significant challenge to telecom surveillance and law enforcement agencies.Officials said the probe uncovered a tactical ""dual-phone"" protocol followed by the module.Each accused carried two to three mobile phones. One ""clean"" handset, registered in their own name, was used for routine personal and professional communication to avoid suspicion. The second, described as a “terror phone”, was used exclusively for encrypted communication with handlers in Pakistan through WhatsApp and Telegram, officials said.The SIM cards used in these secondary devices were issued in the names of unsuspecting civilians whose Aadhaar details had been misused, the officials told news agency PTI. In a parallel development, Jammu and Kashmir Police also uncovered a separate racket in which SIM cards were issued using fake Aadhaar cards.Among those arrested were Muzammil Ganaie and Adeel Rather, while Dr Umar-un-Nabi, another key accused, was killed while driving an explosives-laden vehicle near the Red Fort, officials said. The Pakistani handlers were identified by the codenames ‘Ukasa’, ‘Faizan’ and ‘Hashmi’.Investigators said security agencies noted a disturbing trend in which these compromised SIMs remained active on messaging platforms even when the devices were being operated from Pakistan-occupied Jammu & Kashmir (PoJK) or Pakistan. By exploiting app features that allow continued access without a physical SIM inside the device, handlers were able to remotely guide the module.Officials said the operatives were directed to learn improvised explosive device (IED) assembly through online videos and plan “hinterland” attacks, even though some of the recruits initially wanted to join conflict zones in Syria or Afghanistan.To plug these vulnerabilities, the Centre invoked the Telecommunications Act, 2023, along with the Telecom Cyber Security Rules, to “safeguard the integrity of the telecom ecosystem”. Under the new framework, all Telecommunication Identifier User Entities (TIUEs) have been given 90 days to ensure their applications function only when an active SIM card is present in the device.The order also directs telecom operators to automatically log users out of platforms such as WhatsApp, Telegram and Signal if no active SIM is detected. Messaging and social media platforms, including Snapchat, Sharechat and Jiochat, have been asked to submit compliance reports to the DoT.“This feature of using apps without a SIM is posing a challenge to telecom cyber security as it is being misused from outside the country to commit cyber frauds and terror activities,” the DoT had said while explaining the rationale behind the move.The directive is being fast-tracked in the Jammu and Kashmir telecom circle. While officials acknowledge that deactivating all expired or fraudulent SIMs will take time, the move is being viewed as a significant blow to the digital infrastructure used by terror networks to radicalise and manage “white-collar” operatives.Failure to comply with the new norms will attract stringent action under the Telecom Cyber Security Rules and other applicable laws, officials said.The “white-collar” terror module began to unravel on the intervening night of October 18-19, 2025, when posters of the banned Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) appeared on walls outside Srinagar city, warning of attacks on police and security forces in the Valley.Treating the development as a serious threat, Senior Superintendent of Police, Srinagar, GV Sundeep Chakravarthy constituted multiple teams to carry out an in-depth investigation. Based on the statements of the arrested accused, the probe led police to Al Falah University in Haryana’s Faridabad, where two doctors, Ganaie, a resident of Koil in south Kashmir’s Pulwama, and Shaheen Sayeed from Lucknow, were arrested.A large cache of arms and ammunition, including 2,900 kg of ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate and sulphur, was seized during the operation, officials said.The car explosion near the Red Fort, which claimed 15 lives, is being investigated by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).","Officials said the probe uncovered a tactical ""dual-phone"" protocol followed by the module.

A new campaign leader emerges as Mercer redefines his role behind the scenes

The Real Matt Mercer (feat. Matt Mercer)





Popular gaming voice actor Matthew Mercer has long been the face and guiding voice behind Critical Role’s iconic “Dungeons and Dragons” livestream. However, his decision to step away from overseeing the flagship livestream shocked many fans. For more than a decade, his creative brand of storytelling as the Dungeon Master helped turn a group of voice actors into one of the most influential brands in modern nerd culture.Mercer opened up further about his decision during an August appearance on the podcast “Crispy’s Tavern: Tales and Tea.” He described the move as something that he needed to do after years of constant creative output, leadership, and visibility. He acknowledged that the pace had begun to affect his well-being, and the need to continuously churn out content was physically draining. He believes stepping away will give him time to focus on other creative endeavours.He also emphasized the importance of stepping away when one experiences creative burnout, telling Business Insider, “My biggest advice for burnout is to acknowledge when you’re at the edge and take every opportunity you can to step away and replenish your cup.”However, he remains deeply involved alongside his seven co-founders as the Critical Role Productions’ Chief Creative Officer.The company continued to expand its presence through two animated series backed by Amazon. He also plays a key role at Darrington Press, the studio’s game publishing arm, which launched “Daggerheart,” a tabletop game designed as a fresh alternative to traditional “Dungeons and Dragons.Mercer believes that stepping away will only increase his creativity and make time for other things he wants to do. He said, “Walking away and taking some time to enrich your creative input means that whatever time you lost beating your head against the wall will be more than made up for when you return from a place of genuine inspiration and renewal.”To guide the livestream forward, Brennan Lee Mulligan has taken over as game master for Campaign Four. Known for his work on “Dimension 20” and his long-standing creative partnership with Mercer, Mulligan brings a different energy while maintaining the collaborative spirit fans expect. Campaign Four continues to stream on Beacon, as well as Twitch and YouTube. Most recently, Mercer voiced the character Shroud, who served as the main supervillain of the acclaimed video game Dispatch.Also read: Top 10 Twitch streamers by hours watched and Kai Cenat leads the way","Popular gaming voice actor matthew mercer has long been the face and guiding voice behind critical role’s iconic “dungeons and dragons” livestream.

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon musk has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

Asmongold explains himself after massive backlash on social media







Twitch and Kick streamer Zack “Asmongold” has gone viral after comments made during a recent Just Chatting livestream. A short clip from his broadcast appeared on the r/LivestreamFail subreddit. In the video, the Austin-based streamer shared his views about White liberal women and their role in American politics. The clip quickly spread across social media and triggered heavy backlash.Recently, Asmongold had argued that liberal women, and liberal people more broadly, pose a serious danger to the country. He suggested that their political beliefs lead to harmful immigration policies. His remarks were widely mocked for being extreme and offensive. Within hours, thousands of users were debating and condemning his statements online.The clip drew strong reactions from the Reddit community. Many users mocked Asmongold and dismissed his views. One commenter sarcastically said the streamer was living proof that extreme online spaces create predictable opinions. Another joked that Asmongold’s well-known poor living habits were more of a threat to the country than any political group.Others said they found it hard to take political commentary seriously from someone they see as disconnected from reality.Several users went further, saying the streamer appeared deeply entrenched in his beliefs. One post claimed he was stuck in his own world and unlikely to change his views. Another user joked about the irony of taking political insight from someone they described as unclean and reclusive. Overall, the reaction was overwhelmingly negative, with few defending his stance.Later the same day, Asmongold addressed the controversy during another livestream. He pulled up the Reddit thread and read through many of the comments criticizing him. Rather than backing down, he appeared amused by the backlash.

Why John “Swifty” was banned from Twitch after food delivery streams





John “Swifty” is a well-known World of Warcraft streamer and YouTuber. He has been part of the streaming world for more than a decade. Many fans know him for his WoW PvP gameplay and calm, friendly talk on stream. Swifty created his Twitch channel in 2011 and later became a partnered creator on Twitch, which is owned by Amazon. Over the years, he built a loyal audience. On YouTube, he has more than 670,000 subscribers.In late December 2025, something changed. Swifty started doing real-life “food delivery” streams. These streams showed him delivering food while talking to viewers. He said he started this because January and February are slow months for ad money. On December 27, 2025, these streams became a regular part of his content. Viewers liked it, and the numbers grew fast. But on January 5, 2026, his Twitch channel was permanently banned.The ban shocked many fans because Swifty said this was his first ban in 14 years of streaming. Soon after, his channel showed a message saying it was unavailable due to a violation of Twitch’s Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. Twitch has not shared a public reason beyond that message.In a two-minute video shared on X, John Swifty explained what happened in his own words. He said he believed food delivery streams were allowed because other creators were doing similar content.“Today, I was streaming food delivery. I’ve been doing it for the past week on Twitch, really enjoying it. It’s been amazing. I’ve been doing it to make ends meet in the months of January and February because those are the worst ad revenue months of the year, so I do it in combination with streaming…”Swifty said the streams started doing even better than his gaming content.“It was working out too. I started to get a lot of viewers. I was actually getting more viewers doing food delivery than I was playing World of Warcraft, so I thought it was the greatest thing ever. I had so much fun doing it.”Then came the moment everything stopped.“I saw other people doing food delivery on Twitch so I thought it was fine. I was streaming today and one of my mods, Ava, she called me on the phone, she says, ‘Your channel is gone.’… My channel is perma-banned.”He called the ban shocking, especially after so many years without issues. Swifty also shared that streaming is his only income. His wife is currently caring for their two-week-old baby. Because of this, he started a GoFundMe to help cover living costs and baby supplies while he appeals the ban and looks for other options.At the time of writing, Swifty says he plans to fight the suspension and has filed an appeal. Twitch has not released a separate statement about his case. In other Twitch news, the platform recently faced criticism after unbanning streamer Nina Lin again, which restarted debates about how rules are applied.Also Read: From Kai Cenat To VTubers, The Top 7 List Of The Biggest Twitch Records","John ""swifty"" is a well-known world of warcraft streamer and youtuber.

Hannah Davis’s modelling career glimpses and the net worth of the duo





The wealth story of Derek Jeter starts with the gaming diamond, with his mythical career of 20 years with the New York Yankees, from which he gained approximately $265 million in salary alone. Hannah Davis, his partner, started doing modeling when she was just a teenager after IMG Models signed her up. Davis's initial big break was with Ralph Lauren, who appointed her as the face of the fragrance Ralph Rocks.Derek Jeter made money out of endorsements with Nike, Gatorade, and Rawlings and added $150 million to his empire along the way. His clutch performer and five-time World Series champion status not only defended the marketability but also made him one of the most bankable stars in baseball. Derek's retirement in 2014 signaled the end of an era but the beginning of new adventures in his life as he moved into the world of ownership and management.His most publicized turn was the appointment as the Marlins’ chief executive officer and part-owner, which not only exhibited his ambition to influence baseball from the front office but also got him very much involved in the decision-making. However, he finally left in 2022, although the initiative highlighted his capability of generating different sources of income not only through playing.Recently, Jeter has been moving into the media and business fabrics more with dealings like BetMGM partnerships and regular spots on Fox Sports broadcasting. All these activities, besides keeping his brand alive and making it profitable, are also proof that he is still as financially savvy as he was with his on-field business instincts.Hannah had a short period with the famous fashion label Victoria's Secret, mainly through being the model in various catalogs and advertisements that highlighted her different skills and beauty. Hannah Davis's ascent to fame was further bolstered by her partnerships with both the high-end and mass-market brands like Levi's, Tommy Hilfiger, and American Eagle. She was not only involved in high-fashion campaigns but also worked on the branding of the more affordable and trendy lifestyle categories.Davis’s talent to quickly switch from an editorial shoot to commercial work was the reason why she became the most popular model among the big names in the modeling industry. The net worth of the duo is estimated to be $210 million.Also Read: Exploring $200,000,000 net worth of Hall of Famer Derek Jeter","Derek jeter made money out of endorsements with nike, gatorade, and rawlings.

Melinda French Gates credits her career to IBM hiring manager





Melinda French Gates is one of the wealthiest women in America but her path to a $17.4 billion fortune began with an unusual advice from hiring manager at IBM . A hiring manager at the US-based multinational technology company told her to turn down the job, and instead join Microsoft that was relatively new at that time. French Gates interned at IBM for two summers, and was on the verge of accepting a full-time position with the company.During the conversation, she told the hiring manager that she had interviewed with a tiny company in Seattle, according to Fortune.“My hiring manager at IBM, a female, said to me, ‘Okay, are you ready to accept the job offer?’ And I said, ‘Well, I have one more company to go interview—this little company, Microsoft. It was tiny,” French Gates said during an interview.“And she said, ‘If they give you an offer, you should take it.’ And it dumbfounded me,” she added.The manager’s reason was clear: She reportedly said that a young recruit would have the better chance to move up quickly at Microsoft as it was growing rapidly.French Gates took the leap and moved to the West Coast in Seattle.“I didn’t know anybody in Seattle. It was moving to the West Coast, but I was so excited about what they were doing.I was like, ‘I want to be part of that,’” she said. French Gates spent nine years at Microsoft and became the General Manager of Information Products. She was a critical architect of the company’s expansion, which is now a $3.6 trillion software titan.Reflecting on her journey, French Gates now uses her story to encourage other women.“I remind them all the time you can pivot careers. You can change. It’s not like one or two paths that carry you forward, even though you had plans before this,” she said.“Here’s this woman who’s supposed to be my manager, giving me a piece of career advice,” French Gates said.",Melinda french gates is one of the wealthiest women in america.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu was recently asked by an X (formerly Twitter) user why there is no talk about Arattai now? The user quoted a post stating that Telegram is worth $30 billion with only 30 employees working from home, no office. Responding to the user’s question, Vembu shared that the company is doing “updates weekly” and is working on “some very important features”. “We will market it more once we feel we are satisfied with the feature set!,” Vembu posted, adding “This is a marathon. We are geared for it.”To recall, the Arattai app debuted in 2021 as a rival to Meta’s WhatsApp. Years after its launch, the app recently gained momentum after senior government ministers like Piyush Goyal joined the platform. In September this year, Arattai (meaning chat in Tamil) topped App Store ranking, registering 3,50,000 signs in just three days.Arattai offers familiar features such as:However, the app is still ironing out issues. Users have reported OTP delays, slower contact sync, and call glitches due to server overload.Last month, the company rolled out system-wide end-to-end encryption on the Arattai app. Announcing the release in an X post, Vembu then said that it is a “forced upgrade on all because it is a drastic change”.“We had to do some redesign around it and we wanted extensive testing because it is a drastic change. It is now being tested by about 6,000 people in the company. We identified some issues and have fixed them.

Meta's $2.5 billion bet on AI agents signals new era

Chinese roots raise geopolitical concerns despite Singapore move





The co-founder of Manus, the AI startup recently acquired by Meta for $2.5 billion, has drawn parallels between himself and Mark Zuckerberg , highlighting their shared journey as college dropouts who built successful tech companies. Ji Yichao, the 32-year-old chief scientist and co-founder of Manus, shared two photographs on X showing younger versions of himself and Zuckerberg working on laptops in the same room at the ""Facebook House"" in Palo Alto, California. ""21 years ago and 13 years ago, two dropouts in this same room set out on their own journeys. Today, those paths merge,"" Ji wrote following acquisition announcement.According to Chinese media reports, Ji started a computer science degree at Beijing Information Science and Technology University in 2010 but dropped out to pursue entrepreneurship. He later returned to complete his degree in 2018. Zuckerberg famously left Harvard University in 2004 to focus on building Facebook, which eventually became Meta.The deal includes a $500 million retention pool for Manus employees, as Meta ramps up its foray into AI. Manus will be retained as a stand-alone subscription service while weaving in the startup's technology into Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.Manus, which debuted in March 2024 as a ""general-purpose"" AI agent capable of independently conducting deep research and vacation planning, and even coding and stock analysis, reached more than $100 million in annual recurring revenue in less than a year and gained millions of users.That deal is also not without geopolitical nuances, given that Manus was founded by Butterfly Effect in Beijing and Wuhan in 2022. Still, it moved to Singapore in mid-2025, apparently to hedge against geopolitical risk as part of the U.S.–China tech rivalry.Meta says there will be “no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI” after the acquisition, adding it would wind down services in China. Manus reportedly laid off most of its Chinese staff and now operates with 105 employees across Singapore, Tokyo, and San Francisco.Earlier, Senator John Cornyn had criticised Silicon Valley venture firm Benchmark for its support of Manus, citing fears of American capital underpinning Chinese technology interests.","Meta's $2.5 billion acquisition of ai startup manus sees co-founder ji yichao drawing parallels with mark zuckerberg, both college dropouts who built tech empires.

American billionaire and Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban has revealed that he avoids phone calls altogether. As reported by Fortune, in a TikTok video posted by Masterclass, Cuban said, “No, I don’t do calls. You know, I’ll engage with you via email, and trust me, I do this all the time. I’m really good at it.” He further explained that emails enable him to craft a more thoughtful responses and also helps him in preventing from forgetting details midst his bust schedule. “I’ll give you more comprehensive responses than if it was via phone,” he noted, adding that emails also provide a searchable record of conversations.Cuban’s stance echoes a broader generational trend. Many Gen Zers prefer email or text over calls, but for different reasons. A 2024 study found nearly a quarter of the generation avoids answering phone calls entirely, often due to telephobia — a form of phone anxiety that can trigger physical symptoms such as nausea, shaking, and difficulty concentrating.Talking to Business Insider, Billionaire Mark Cuban revealed that his daily routine is not at all exciting rather it’s quite boring. “I read and respond to emails,"" he wrote in an email.""I work out. I read and respond to emails. I do a couple Zooms. Then I read and respond to emails. Then I eat dinner. Then I read and respond to emails,” Cuban told BI.He revealed that his day starts with a decaf coffee and a cookie. He then takes her daughter to school and after that he works out at Life Time Fitness. Once done with the fitness regimen he again dives into his inbox. Despite his wealth, Cuban refuses to hire an assistant to manage his email, saying it would only “slow things down.”“I receive around 700 emails a day and use three phones (two Android and one iPhone) to manage everything. I'd rather get 700 to 1,000 emails than sit in long, boring meetings,” Cuban told BI.He emphasised that emails work for him because they come with searchable history. He also use Gmail’s auto-replies for 10–20% of messages. Cuban also mentioned that that in order to stay focused he keeps the unread emails under 20.Cuban rarely disconnects from email—even on vacation. “It’s faster to just get it out of the way,” he said. Only family events or emergencies prompt him to step away from his inbox for more than a few hours.While some may find his routine monotonous, Cuban sees it as a strategic advantage.","Billionaire mark cuban reveals his daily routine in a tiktok video posted by masterclass. “i read and respond to emails,"" he wrote in an email.

This new role aims to balance rapid AI advancement with crucial safeguards, a challenging task given the technology's unprecedented capabilities and potential dangers.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

Safety teams keep vanishing as products multiply

Lawsuits paint darker picture of AI's mental health toll





The man who unleashed ChatGPT on the world is now sounding the alarm about his own creation. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is hunting for a Head of Preparedness to tackle what he calls ""real challenges"" emerging from AI systems that have grown so sophisticated they're finding critical security vulnerabilities and impacting users' mental health. The $555,000 role comes as the company that revolutionised generative AI in late 2022 grapples with lawsuits, safety team departures, and the uncomfortable reality that its technology may be causing genuine harm.""Models are improving quickly and are now capable of many great things, but they are also starting to present some real challenges,"" Altman wrote on X. He didn't sugarcoat the position's demands, warning applicants: ""This will be a stressful job and you'll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately.""The new hire will lead OpenAI's preparedness framework, evaluating frontier AI capabilities and coordinating safeguards across cybersecurity, biosecurity, and the prospect of AI systems that can improve themselves—challenges that Altman admits have ""little precedent."" The company specifically needs help figuring out ""how to enable cybersecurity defenders with cutting edge capabilities while ensuring attackers can't use them for harm.The job opening arrives amid a disturbing pattern at OpenAI: safety teams appear, then disappear. The company's Superalignment team, launched in 2023 with the mission of preventing AI systems ""much smarter than us"" from going rogue, lasted less than a year before being disbanded in May 2024. Co-leader Jan Leike quit with a blistering exit statement, declaring that ""safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products. ""The AGI Readiness team met a similar fate in October 2024, dissolved after advising on the company's preparedness for artificial general intelligence. Meanwhile, Aleksander Madry, OpenAI's previous Head of Preparedness, was reassigned in July 2024 to work on AI reasoning instead—leaving the crucial safety position vacant for months even as the technology advanced.The urgency behind the new position becomes clearer when examining the lawsuits piling up against OpenAI. Multiple families allege ChatGPT reinforced delusions, deepened isolation, and even encouraged suicide. One case involves a 16-year-old California boy; another centers on a 56-year-old Connecticut man who allegedly murdered his mother and killed himself after interactions with the chatbot that fueled his paranoid delusions.OpenAI says it's working to improve ChatGPT's ability to ""recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress,"" but the company hasn't slowed its product velocity. Despite Altman's 2023 signing of a letter warning that AI extinction risks deserve priority alongside ""pandemics and nuclear war,"" OpenAI keeps accelerating. The company, now valued at $157 billion after October's $6.6 billion funding round, is reportedly negotiating with Amazon for another investment exceeding $10 billion.That contradiction—tech leaders prophesying catastrophe while racing to build the very technology they fear—hasn't gone unnoticed. ""If they honestly believe this could bring about human extinction, then why not just stop?"" asked one critic after Altman's Congressional testimony. The new Head of Preparedness will inherit that impossible balancing act: making AI safer while the company that employs them pushes relentlessly forward.","Openai's sam altman seeks a high-stakes 'head of preparedness' to address ai's growing security risks and mental health impacts.

The IIT rejection redirected his life towards a path only few could have imagined and which eventually led him to become the CEO of Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable companies. Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software. Nadella further added that like many of friends he also viewed IIT as the pinnacle of academic achievement. But when he failed to secure admission, Nadella faced a setback that could have easily defined his future. Instead, it became the catalyst for a different journey.Nadella described IIT as “the holy grail” for middle-class students, acknowledging the weight of expectations. Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there. However, all these experiences helped him in building adaptability which later went ahead and defined his leadership style.Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992, after working at Sun Microsystems. Over, the next two decade he rose steadily through the ranks and the became the Microsoft CEO in 2014. When Nadella became the CEO, the company was facing a lot competition from Apple, Google and Amazon.

“Billionaire Alexandr Wang says he wants to wait to have kids until Neuralink is very advanced, because children’s brains in the first seven years are more flexible and can learn brain-computer interfaces, unlocking more potential than adult brains

Speaking on a podcast, Wang explained that he wants to wait until Neuralink or similar BCI technology is reliable and widely available. His reasoning is that children born into such a world could integrate the technology directly into their developing brains, rather than having to adapt to it later in life

He pointed to neuroplasticity, the brain’s heightened ability to form neural connections in early childhood, arguing that during the first ~7 years, children could learn to use brain-computer interfaces in ways adults simply cannot.

""I think with plasticity, you're talking, in general, you're talking about the entire brain. You're talking about altering a trillion synapses all in a similar way,"" he said.

At a deeper level, Wang’s comments reflect a broader concern: artificial intelligence is advancing at an exponential pace, while human biological evolution is slow. He suggests that direct neural links to AI may eventually be necessary for humans to remain cognitively competitive in a future shaped by superintelligence.”

“It's never an easy decision to say goodbye to colleagues. These are talented people who have worked extremely hard and contributed to our Al effort. Anyone in North America whose role was impacted has already been notified. Those who may be impacted in EMEA have been notified and remain subject to consultation,” Wang said.

“This by no means signals any decrease in investment. In fact, we will continue to hire industry-leading Al-native talent. Our goal is to enable MSL to move faster. We remain excited about the models we are training, our ambitious compute plans, and the products we are building, and I'm confident in our path to superintelligence,” he added.





Alexandr Wang, the head of Meta’s artificial intelligence division — SuperIntelligence Labs has now given a new statement on his plans of having kids. Speaking at The Shawn Rayan Show, Wang said that he wait until Elon Musk ’s Neuralink or similar brain‑computer interface (BCI) technology is highly advanced before having children. Wang is of the opinion that child neuroplasticity offers the best window for adopting brain‑computer interfaces, and that future generations could grow up learning to use superintelligence tools intuitively. “I’ll have kids after Neuralink is very advanced, because children’s brains in the first seven years are more flexible and can learn brain-computer interfaces, unlocking more potential than adult brains,” said Wang.Tesla CEO Elon Musk founded Neuralink is presently conducting clinical trials and is working at restoring mobility for patients with paralysis. Musk has long promoted the idea of expanding the technology to enhance human cognition. Wang’s remarks highlight how some tech leaders see BCIs not just as medical tools, but as essential upgrades for future generations.Meta Superintelligence Lab (MSL), the billion-dollar team that Mark Zuckerberg created to take on Google and OpenAI in artificial intelligence (AI), is hiring. Alexandr Wang, the head of the team and Chief AI officer of Meta, has announced that the company is hiring for its team in Singapore. This comes hours after the social media giant acquired Manus AI, a Singapore-based company working on AI agents.“MSL is hiring in Singapore! We already have some amazing researchers and engineers there, buoyed now by the 100-strong Manus team, and we’re growing fast,” Wang said in a post on X (formerly Twitter). “Feel free to DM with a resumé if interested!,” he added.In the memo, Alexandr Wang wrote:","Alexandr wang, the head of meta’s artificial intelligence division — superintelligence labs has now given a new statement on his plans of having kids.
