Read Sridhar Vembu’s complete post here



I have heard so many accounts from Sindhi friends about how their families had to leave everything and come to India during partition. They rebuilt their lives and Sindhis have done well in India.

I am sad to say this, but for Indians on an H1-B visa in America, this may be that time. Come back home. It may take 5 years to rebuild your lives but it will make you stronger.

Do not live in fear. Make the bold move. You will do well.

What it means for India







The entire technology and IT industry is in shock after US President Donald Trump announce massive five hike for H-1B visa. As per the revised regulations the companies that are recruiting foreign professionals will now have to submit $1,00,000 payment for each H-1B application. After the announcement many tech giants such as Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and others have asked their employees to return to US by September 21. Now, Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu has also issued a piece of advice to Indian techies ‘come back to India to rebuild’. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Vemu drew parallel with the Partition of India in order to explain the current H-1B situation. He mentioned the stories of his Sindhi friends whose families were forced to leave everything but they eventually thrived after starting over again.“I am sad to say this, but for Indians on an H1-B visa in America, this may be that time. Come back home. It may take 5 years to rebuild your lives but it will make you stronger. Do not live in fear. Make the bold move. You will do well,” wrote Vembu.Vembu, himself worked in the US and then returned to India to build Zoho into a global SaaS powerhouse.He suggested that the present visa turmoil can be turning point for the Indian talent. He said that India today offer multiple opportunities as compared to that in the past. He also adds that those willing to take this leap will ultimately benefit from it.The hike in the visa fees could lead to reverse migration of skilled professionals, strengthening its domestic tech and startup ecosystem. With a booming digital economy, expanding capital markets, and global companies setting up R&D hubs, India of 2025 offers fertile ground for ambitious graduates who might once have seen the US as their only path to success.","Zoho founder sridhar vembu has issued an advice to indian techies.

ESPN planned a transition before Molly Qerim’s contract expired

Salary expectations and ESPN’s financial focus played a key role

Molly Qerim’s sudden exit from ESPN’s First Take left many fans surprised, given her strong presence and years of consistency as co-host alongside Stephen A. Smith. But new details have shed light on the decision, showing that it was less about controversy and more about timing, business priorities, and financial realities at the network.Burke Magnus, ESPN’s head of content, recently addressed the matter, clarifying that Qerim’s contract was already set to expire by the end of the year. According to him, the company had long been considering a shift. “She was going to come off First Take either way and that was something [where] we had already crossed that bridge,” Magnus explained.He emphasized that the network wanted to expand Qerim’s versatility by getting her involved in other projects, rather than tying her exclusively to one show. Importantly, he praised her character and work ethic, stating, “She’s an awesome person,” while noting, “You know, it’s business.”Behind the scenes, salary dynamics also influenced the decision. With Stephen A. Smith recently signing a $105 million deal averaging $21 million per year, ESPN executives were reluctant to commit major dollars to Qerim’s role. While respected, her co-hosting duties were seen as replaceable by someone who could perform the same function at a lower cost.Reports indicate ESPN is now preparing for a 30- to 45-day casting process to find Molly Qerim’s successor, though no replacement names have been officially revealed.Also Read: ""Early next year"": Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift’s wedding could arrive sooner than fans expecte For loyal viewers, Molly Qerim’s departure marks the end of an era.

Support for skilled immigration

Criticism of the system



The $100,000 visa fee controversy





Elon Musk’s position on the H-1B visa programme reflects a complex interplay of personal experience, corporate imperatives, and public statements that often appear contradictory. Musk himself entered the United States on an H-1B visa, a fact he credits with enabling his entrepreneurial journey and the growth of companies such as Tesla and SpaceX. While he openly praises the programme for attracting critical talent from across the globe, he has also criticised its systemic flaws, calling it “broken” and advocating for reforms such as higher salary thresholds and additional regulatory fees. The recent hike of H-1B visa fees to $100,000 has brought renewed scrutiny to Musk’s nuanced stance, highlighting the tension between supporting skilled immigration and addressing perceived inefficiencies within the system.Elon Musk’s own experience as an H-1B visa holder provides him with a unique perspective on the programme. He has frequently emphasised that the visa enabled him to work legally in the United States and to build his companies with access to top-tier talent.Musk often cites the role of H-1B holders in helping scale Tesla, SpaceX, and other ventures, pointing to engineers and executives who were instrumental in advancing technology, production, and innovation. His personal journey illustrates the potential benefits of skilled immigration, while simultaneously informing his calls for reform. Musk’s dual perspective as a former visa holder and CEO of high-tech enterprises makes his stance particularly influential in ongoing debates about immigration policy.Despite his criticism of certain aspects of the H-1B system, Musk remains a staunch advocate for attracting skilled international talent. He credits the programme with helping to fill critical gaps in sectors such as engineering, software development, and aerospace design, where domestic talent alone may not be sufficient to meet demand. Musk’s companies have relied on H-1B holders to maintain competitiveness in the global market, innovate at pace, and support large-scale production and research projects. His support underscores the broader economic argument that skilled immigration is essential for maintaining the United States’ leadership in high-tech industries and sustaining long-term innovation.At the same time, Musk has repeatedly criticised the H-1B programme for allowing potential misuse and creating incentives that may disadvantage domestic workers. He has argued that low salary thresholds and insufficient regulatory oversight can lead to exploitation of foreign labour and reduced opportunities for American employees. Musk has proposed reforms including significantly higher minimum salaries for visa holders and annual maintenance fees, which he believes would ensure that the programme genuinely serves highly skilled professionals rather than providing a cost-saving mechanism for companies. His critique highlights the tension between maintaining access to critical talent and protecting domestic labour markets.The recent U.S. government decision to increase H-1B visa fees to $100,000 has reignited debate about the programme’s affordability and accessibility. For companies reliant on foreign talent, including many of Musk’s ventures, the fee represents a substantial increase in operational costs. The policy has prompted questions about whether smaller companies and startups might struggle to compete for skilled workers, potentially slowing innovation. Musk’s nuanced stance demonstrates the balancing act between advocating for the continued flow of skilled international talent and supporting regulatory measures designed to address system abuses and ensure fairness.Elon Musk’s approach to the H-1B visa programme illustrates the inherent tension between personal experience, corporate requirements, and systemic reform. As a former H-1B holder, he recognises the immense value of skilled immigration in fostering innovation and economic growth. Simultaneously, his critiques and reform proposals reflect a desire to make the system fairer, more accountable, and sustainable for both foreign talent and domestic labour markets. Musk’s unique position as an entrepreneur, former visa holder, and public commentator places him at the centre of one of the most contentious debates in U.S. immigration policy.","Elon musk’s position on the h-1b visa programme reflects a complex interplay of personal experience, corporate imperatives, and public statements that often appear contradictory.

The recent H-1B visa fees hike announced by US President Donald Trump created an atmosphere of chaos. The massive hike in the H-1B visa fees rattled the tech industry.

With the new $100,000 fee, the economics of hiring foreign talent have been upended, sparking fears of layoffs, relocations, and a potential reverse migration back to India.Musk’s past words — contrasting with his more recent criticisms of the program as “broken” — highlight the tensions between business needs, political rhetoric, and immigration realities.","The recent h-1b visa fees hike announced by us president donald trump created an atmosphere of chaos.

Impact of H-1B fee hike on US tech and economy





The H-1B visa, introduced by the United States in 1990, has long been a pathway for highly skilled professionals from across the globe to contribute to America’s technology sector. Many of today’s tech leaders, including Elon Musk, Sundar Pichai, and Satya Nadella, entered the US through this programme, allowing them to innovate, lead companies, and create global impact. These visas have been instrumental in building Silicon Valley and advancing AI, cloud computing, and consumer technology. With the recent $100,000 fee imposed on new H-1B applicants, it’s more important than ever to recognise the pivotal role these H-1B holders have played in shaping the US tech ecosystem.Musk initially entered the US on a J-1 exchange visa and later obtained an H-1B to pursue academic training and business ventures. He has been central to the success of SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink, and X Corp, employing thousands of engineers and professionals globally. Musk credits the H-1B programme for enabling him and other highly talented individuals to create groundbreaking technologies, from reusable rockets to mass-market electric vehicles.His advocacy for skilled immigration highlights the importance of global talent in driving innovation and maintaining America’s leadership in tech.Pichai came to the US as an international student before transitioning to an H-1B visa, which allowed him to join Google in product management roles. Over the years, he rose to become CEO of Alphabet, overseeing key innovations in AI, Google Cloud, and hardware like Pixel phones and Nest devices. Pichai’s leadership has guided Google through major technological shifts, expanding AI research, cloud services, and consumer applications, positioning Google as a global technology leader.Nadella moved to the US in the early 1990s and obtained an H-1B visa to work at Microsoft. Rising through the ranks, he became CEO in 2014, leading Microsoft’s transformation through cloud computing, AI, and enterprise solutions. Nadella emphasises the critical role of skilled immigrants in fostering innovation and growth, highlighting that many of Microsoft’s most transformative projects have been driven by talent brought to the US through H-1B.Srinivas arrived in the US as a student and leveraged his H-1B visa to work in AI research. He later founded Perplexity AI, a company valued at $9 billion, offering cutting-edge AI solutions globally. His journey highlights the link between skilled immigration and leadership in next-generation technology.Yuan, a Chinese immigrant, faced multiple visa rejections before securing his H-1B to enter the US. He founded Zoom, which became an essential tool for global communication during the COVID-19 pandemic, supporting millions of remote workers, schools, and enterprises. Yuan’s story demonstrates how H-1B visas enable entrepreneurs to build companies that have a global impact.Bansal came to the US on an H-1B visa in 2000 and founded AppDynamics, a software monitoring company. AppDynamics grew rapidly and was acquired for $3.7 billion, creating significant employment opportunities and boosting the tech ecosystem. Bansal’s entrepreneurial success underscores the value H-1B holders bring to innovation and economic growth.H-1B holders have been vital in founding, running, and scaling technology companies, filling high-skilled roles, driving innovation, and creating trillions in market value. Companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple, and Indian-origin firms like TCS rely on these visas to access global talent that fuels growth and competitiveness in the tech industry. These skilled professionals are often the backbone of innovation hubs and help maintain the US’s global leadership in technology. Their contributions extend beyond tech, impacting research, education, and economic growth nationwide.The recent $100,000 fee for new H-1B applications has caused global concern, with tech leaders warning that such measures could limit access to skilled talent and slow innovation. Despite these hurdles, H-1B holders continue to demonstrate their vital role in shaping America’s technology landscape, proving that skilled immigrants remain essential to the country’s innovation and economic strength.","Donald trump's h-1b visa fee hike shocks tech giants and indians, experts call the move 'regressive' many of today’s tech leaders, including elon musk, sundar pichai, and satya nadella, entered the us through this programme, allowing them to innovate, lead companies, and create global impact.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124037298,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-52238,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Billionaire Richard Branson ignored on NYC streets while promoting ‘Doorbell of Dreams’



New Yorkers too busy to notice Richard Branson with a mic



Billionaire’s rejections spark laughter and praise online

British billionaire Richard Branson, best known as the adventurous founder of the Virgin Group, recently experienced an unusual moment on the bustling streets of New York City. While promoting his latest initiative, Doorbell of Dreams, the 75-year-old tycoon tried stopping passersby for quick interviews, only to be repeatedly ignored. Despite his global fame and media presence, New Yorkers brushed past him as though he were just another man with a microphone or a street performer. The incident, filmed by entrepreneur Simon Squibb, quickly went viral on Instagram, sparking amusement, admiration, and lighthearted commentary online. What began as a fun campaign to encourage everyday dreamers to pitch their business ideas turned into an unexpected lesson in humility, showing that even billionaires are not immune to everyday rejection, unpredictability, public scrutiny, or the realities of life outside celebrity circles.During a lighthearted promotional event, Branson attempted to stop pedestrians for quick interviews. Despite his global reputation, most passersby ignored him, hurrying along as though he were just another stranger with a microphone.The unusual moment, filmed by entrepreneur Simon Squibb, quickly gained traction on Instagram, showing the tycoon facing rejection after rejection.This unexpected moment wasn’t just a publicity stunt; it was part of a campaign to promote “Doorbell of Dreams.” The initiative, launched by Branson in partnership with Squibb’s startup HelpBnk, invites everyday dreamers to pitch their business ideas in under 60 seconds.What makes the concept unique is its accessibility. Through a specially designed video doorbell, aspiring entrepreneurs can present their ideas, with the hope of receiving mentorship, guidance, or even investment. Originally launched in the UK, the project recently expanded to New York, where Virgin Hotels partnered as a venue for participants. The street interviews were meant to spark curiosity among locals and draw attention to the campaign.The video shows Branson politely approaching strangers with the question, “Can I ask you a question?” But instead of engaging, most people brushed him off. One woman walked by without so much as a glance, while another looked briefly at him before rushing away, clearly preoccupied with her own thoughts, errands, and smartphone notifications, unaware of the rare opportunity to interact with a global icon.For a man who has conquered industries from airlines to space travel, being ignored on the sidewalk was a rare and humbling experience, highlighting the ordinary challenges everyone faces. Squibb, amused by the scene, remarked, “A bit of rejection is healthy.” Branson laughed at himself and replied, “I’m not doing too well, am I?” Eventually, a passerby did agree to share his dream, stating his goal was to achieve financial independence, help others, and contribute positively to the world in meaningful, impactful ways.Once uploaded, the clip drew widespread attention on social media. Many users were stunned that a man of Branson’s stature could blend so seamlessly into the crowd. One viewer commented, “Richard Branson getting rejected? Unbelievable!” Another wrote, “Imagine ignoring one of the world’s most inspirational entrepreneurs who’s just asking you a simple question.”The rejections, however, were not seen as embarrassing but rather refreshing. Viewers praised Branson’s good-natured attitude and willingness to step into unfamiliar situations despite his status. A popular comment read, “This is what humility looks like. Sir Richard Branson has every reason to stay in his comfort zone, but he still pushes himself.”","Billionaire richard branson ignored on nyc streets while promoting ‘doorbell of dreams’ the video shows branson politely approaching strangers with the question, “can i ask you a question?” but instead of engaging, most people brushed him off.

Did Amazon trick customers into Prime? A court trial begins today in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/did-amazon-trick-customers-into-prime-a-court-trial-begins-today-in-us/articleshow/124059450.cms,"



SEATTLE: A trial in federal court in Seattle set to begin this week will cut to the heart of how Amazon defines itself as a champion for the hundreds of millions of consumers who use its online shopping service.The Federal Trade Commission claims, in a lawsuit filed two years ago, that Amazon tricked tens of millions of people into signing up for its Prime membership program, and then made it hard for customers to cancel when they wanted out. “Amazon was aware for years that it was taking consumers’ money without their consent, yet chose to do nothing about it,” the FTC wrote in a recent court filing.Amazon, which denies those claims, hopes a jury will believe that customers signed up for Prime simply because they thought it was a good deal. “The way Amazon drives Prime subscribers is by making the service useful and valuable,” Mark Blafkin, an Amazon spokesperson, said in a statement. “And our approach works — Prime, with hundreds of millions of members, is among the highest performing subscription programs of any kind, as measured by renewal rates and customer satisfaction. ”Though less sweeping than the FTC’s antitrust case against Amazon, the lawsuit targets the company for the way it runs a popular subscription program central to its business and ubiquitous in the lives of many of its customers.“The TrumpVance FTC intends to secure justice for Americans harmed by Amazon’s practices,” Joe Simonson, an FTC spokesperson, said in a statement. “We’re looking forward to the trial.”Since Prime was introduced two decades ago, it has grown into what the FTC called “the world’s largest subscription service.” Amazon’s founder, Jeff Bezos, has long called it a “pillar” of the company. It costs $139 per year or $14.99 a month, and includes fast shipping, video streaming, discounts at Whole Foods, which Amazon owns, and other perks.“We want Prime to be such a good value, you would be irresponsible not to be a member,” Bezos wrote in 2016.Judge John H Chun of the US District Court for the Western District of Washington ruled last week that at least two senior executives, Neil Lindsay and Jamil Ghani, would be considered personally liable if a jury finds that Amazon violated the law. Amazon said the executives acted properly and put customers first.Jury selection was likely to begin Monday, with opening arguments starting Tuesday. The case is set to last for about a month. An estimated 200 million people in the US use Prime to shop on Amazon.","The federal trade commission claims that amazon tricked tens of millions of people into signing up for its prime membership program.

Why BRIDGE could reshape media in 2026 and beyond





The UAE’s new BRIDGE Summit will bring the global media, content and entertainment industries together in one place: Abu Dhabi’s ADNEC from 8–10 December 2025, with organizers expecting a massive marketplace of ideas, deals and partnerships across three days. The summit promises tens of thousands of visitors, hundreds of speakers and a program designed to map the next era of storytelling, platforms and regulation.BRIDGE is a first-of-its-kind global platform that positions creators, publishers, platforms, policymakers and investors in the same room to speed collaboration, investment and standards for the media age. It’s built to be both a conference and a marketplace not just panels and keynotes, but matchmaking, masterclasses, deal-making zones and policy roundtables aimed at creating long-term value across the creative chain. That mix is what organizers say makes BRIDGE different from traditional trade shows.BRIDGE will draw a wide cross-section: creative founders, streaming and platform executives, ad-tech and games firms, public broadcasters, regulators, investors and academia. Partners and participating companies already referenced in the platform include major media and technology names, signaling heavy industry involvement.Key themes to expect:BRIDGE is deliberately ambitious: it combines scale (tens of thousands of people and 1.65 million sq ft), program depth (scores of panels and hands-on workshops) and a market focus (matchmaking, MOUs, investment) to move the conversation from talk to transactions.
