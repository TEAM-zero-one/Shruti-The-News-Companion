HAL receives 3rd GE engine for Tejas Mk-1A fighter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hal-received-3rd-ge-engine-for-tejas-mk-1a-fighter/articleshow/123829136.cms,"Poll Do you support HAL's efforts to increase the production of LCA-Mk1A despite engine supply constraints? Yes, it's essential for national security. No, I think it will lead to more delays.

BENGALURU: Defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) Thursday said it has received the third GE-404 engine for the LCA-MK1A (Tejas Mk1A).“One more engine is scheduled to be delivered by the end of Sept 2025. Engine supply chain improvement will pave the way for LCA-Mk1A aircraft deliveries,” the PSU said in a statement.In July, HAL CMD DK Sunil, in a one-on-one interview to TOI had said the PSU would roll out the first LCA Tejas Mk1A from its new Nashik production line by the end of July, which is yet to happen.The rollout from Nashik will mark a key milestone in HAL’s efforts to scale up Tejas production, even as the programme works through engine supply constraints and indigenous radar integration delays.While the current year may see three to four aircraft from Nashik, the plant has been built to support an annual output of eight. At present, HAL is operating two production lines in Bengaluru and has initiated the third at Nashik.A parallel private-sector supply chain — comprising VEM Technologies (centre fuselage), Alpha (rear fuselage), and L&T (wings) — is expected to contribute towards an additional six aircraft a year, eventually raising the overall production capacity to 30 aircraft annually.Sunil had said that despite engine supply delays from GE, HAL is pressing ahead with deliveries. “We have already built six aircraft which are ready and flying,” Sunil had told TOI. HAL expects to produce 12 aircraft this year, using available GE engines in rotation to carry out critical test flights. GE, which has now supplied three engines, has assured delivery of 12 engines this financial year.The deliveries are part of an order worth $716 million (Rs 5,375 crore) HAL had placed for 99 engines and support services with GE Aviation.“This is the largest ever deal and purchase order placed by HAL for LCA,” HAL had said in 2021, adding that the orders were placed for the highest thrust variant of the GE-F404 family of engines — the F404-GE-IN20.HAL, which has come under severe criticism from the Indian Air Force (IAF) for delays in the LCA programme had, in early 2021, had got a Rs 46,898-crore order for 83 Tejas Mk-1A fighters, and at the time the promise was to start deliveries 36 months from the date of receiving the order.The order HAL has got is for 73 fighters and 10 trainers and the clearance for this was given by the Cabinet Committee on Security (CCS) in Jan 2021. The Mark-1A will have at least 43 “improvements” over the Tejas Mark-1 jets which the IAF has already placed orders for earlier.","Hal has received the third ge-404 engine for the lca-mk1a (tejas mk1a) one more engine is scheduled to be delivered by the end of sept 2025.

"Ministry proposes Rs 2,600 fitness test fee for private vehicles over 20 years old",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ministry-proposes-rs-2600-fitness-test-fee-for-private-vehicles-over-20-years-old/articleshow/123841326.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Barely weeks after govt increased renewal charges of older vehicles, the road transport ministry has proposed a steep hike in fitness test fee of private vehicles over 20 years and higher for medium and heavy commercial vehicles which are more than 15 years old.While owners of 20-year-old cars would have to cough up Rs 2,600 for the test, for trucks and buses, it would cost Rs 25,000.TOI has learnt that the intent behind this move is to disincentivise people to hold on to their old vehicles. Sources said the govt is also considering having proper fitness tests for private vehicles once they attain 15 years. Currently, RTOs give fitness certificates by just taking a look at the condition of private vehicles rather than putting them through tests.Sources said the ministry is looking into the option of whether mandatory automated technical tests should be rolled out in a staggered manner, such as starting with cars.As per the draft norm published by the ministry, there is a proposal to introduce separate fee slabs for commercial vehicles that are over 10, 13, 15 and 20 years. At present, the testing fee for commercial vehicles above 20 years is the same as that for 15-year-old vehicles.It has proposed to double the testing fee for certification of fitness for vehicles that are more than 20 years old.Under the Motor Vehicle Rules, fitness test for commercial vehicles is mandatory every two years up to eight years and annually thereafter. In case of private vehicles this test is required at the time of registration renewal, which is after 15 years, and then every five years. ""We have been urging the govt to change this regime, and fitness test for private vehicles should also be made mandatory after 10 years. Whether it's a private or commercial vehicle, fitness must be the priority. Any unfit vehicle is a risk for all road users,"" said Anil Chhikara, the former deputy transport commissioner of Delhi.","The intent behind this move is to disincentivise people to hold on to their old vehicles.

Gadkari seeks Sitharaman incentives for scrapping old vehicles,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/gadkari-seeks-sitharaman-incentives-for-scrapping-old-vehicles/articleshow/123841247.cms,"NEW DELHI: Road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari Thursday asked auto companies to give ""reasonably good"" discounts to consumers if they scrap their old, polluting vehicles, and said he has approached Prime Minister Narendra Modi and finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman for fresh GST benefits to those replacing outdated models.Addressing the 65th annual convention of Society of Indian Automobile Manufacturers (Siam), Gadkari said financial incentives for vehicle scrappage will help tackle the growing vehicular pollution across cities, while also helping push sales of new vehicles and enable govt to collect more tax.""Day before yesterday, I requested the FM and also the PM that to encourage scrappage and those replacing older vehicles, they should consider something on GST,"" the minister added.He said that scrappage is a ""win-win"" for both the industry and govt as this could also help companies get access to precious metals from scrapped vehicles, instead of getting them through imports. Gadkari said that at present, an average of 16,830 vehicles are being scrapped monthly, and the private sector has invested Rs 2,700 crore towards this effort.""The steel scrap that we import is 60 lakh tonnes. And apart from this, the very important metals, where there is a shortage and which you have to bring from outside, can also be accessed through scrapping,"" Gadkari said.","Road transport and highways minister nitin gadkari asked auto companies to give ""reasonably good"" discounts to consumers if they scrap their old, polluting vehicles.

5 Key things you missed at Apple iPhone launch event





Following the tragic shooting of President Donald Trump aide Charlie Kirk at a rally in Utah, graphic videos of the incident quickly went viral across major social media platforms, sparking renewed scrutiny over content moderation policies. According to a report by The New York Times, within minutes of the shooting on Wednesday (September 10), videos were posted on Elon Musk 's X and were viewed over 11 million times within two hours. The graphic footage also spread to Meta-owned platforms like Instagram and Threads, as well as YouTube and Telegram, accumulating millions of views.The viral spread of the video has forced major platforms to respond, with varying approaches. Musk-owned X’s official policy prohibits “excessively gory” content but allows it to be posted with a warning label.The company posted online that it “will continue to stand against violence and censorship, ensuring this platform amplifies truth and open dialogue for everyone.”Google-owned YouTube said that the platform is removing some graphic content and applying age restrictions to other videos to prevent them from being seen by users under 18.“Our hearts are with Charlie Kirk’s family following his tragic death. We are closely monitoring our platform and prominently elevating news content on the homepage, in search and in recommendations to help people stay informed,” the spokesman was quoted as saying.Meta – the parent company of Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and Threads – declined to comment but some clips on its platforms were found to have been marked as sensitive, while others were not, the report said.Experts say this event continues a long-standing and troubling trend, adding that the proliferation of violent content has become a grim fixture of the internet.“This is the first time such a widely recognised figure has been murdered in such a public way and spread this way on social media,” said Emerson Brooking, director of strategy at the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council.","Graphic videos of the shooting of president donald trump aide charlie kirk quickly went viral across major social media platforms.

Life and legacy of Larry Ellison

Family and personal interests





“When people start telling you that you’re crazy, you just might be on to the most important innovation in your life,” Larry Ellison said in 2016. Fast forward to 2025, he is at the most important position in the billionaires’ world—the richest man on Earth with a staggering net worth of $393 billion. The 81-year-old Oracle cofounder dethroned Elon Musk after Oracle’s stock soared on the back of massive AI-driven cloud contracts, propelling his wealth by an unprecedented $101 billion overnight. As of September 10, 2025, Ellison’s fortune stands at an astonishing $393 billion, placing him at the top of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Larry Ellison co-founded Oracle Corporation in 1977, then known as Software Development Laboratories. The company quickly rose to prominence with Oracle Version 2 (1979), the first commercially available SQL-based relational database management system (RDBMS). This innovation secured Oracle’s leadership in enterprise database technology through the 1980s and 1990s.Under Ellison’s leadership, Oracle became the world’s largest database management company by 1987 and went public in 1986. The company expanded aggressively, acquiring PeopleSoft in 2005, Sun Microsystems in 2010, and NetSuite in 2016, moves that cemented Oracle’s presence in enterprise applications, hardware, and cloud infrastructure.Ellison’s vision transformed Oracle from a startup into a $40 billion-plus software powerhouse.In the 2020s, Oracle pivoted strongly into artificial intelligence and cloud services, becoming a key provider for AI companies hungry for computing power. As CTO and executive chairman, Ellison drove the development of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), purpose-built for AI workloads with custom networking and chips. In 2025, Oracle unveiled its $500 billion Stargate initiative to build global AI infrastructure and industry-specific platforms, making it a central force in AI inference, a multi-trillion-dollar emerging market.The launch of Oracle’s AI Database, integrating enterprise data with models like ChatGPT, reinforced its dominance. By unifying hardware, software, and cloud services under one roof, Oracle reduced latency and costs, setting itself apart from rivals. These innovations have powered Oracle’s stock to double in 2025, sending Ellison’s fortune soaring.Ellison’s net worth of $393 billion pushed him past Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whose wealth fell to $385 billion as Tesla’s shares slid 13% this year and its U.S. market share dropped to its lowest since 2017. Ellison also overtook Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who previously held the second-richest spot. Musk, who first claimed the title in 2021 before losing it to Jeff Bezos and Bernard Arnault, reclaimed the crown in 2024 and held it for nearly 300 days. Ellison’s ascent marks the first time he has reached the very top, reshaping the billionaire rivalry in Silicon Valley.Beyond Oracle, Ellison has built a diverse portfolio. In August 2025, he acquired nearly 50% of Paramount Skydance, the $28 billion media giant formed through the merger of Paramount and his son David’s Skydance. He also served on Tesla’s board from 2018 to 2022 and was a significant shareholder during his tenure. These ventures highlight Ellison’s strategy of combining core technology investments with cultural influence, extending his impact beyond the enterprise software world.Born in 1944, Ellison dropped out of both the University of Illinois and the University of Chicago before beginning his career building databases for the CIA. He went on to lead Oracle for 37 years as CEO before stepping down in 2014 to become executive chairman and CTO. Known for his bold personality and risk-taking approach, Ellison has left an indelible mark on the software and cloud industry. In 2012, he bought nearly the entire Hawaiian island of Lanai for $300 million, later moving there permanently in 2020. His career reflects both persistence and a willingness to defy convention.Ellison has four children, two of whom—Megan and David—are influential Hollywood producers. Megan Ellison financed critically acclaimed films like Zero Dark Thirty and American Hustle, while David produced mainstream blockbusters such as The Terminator and Mission: Impossible. Outside business, Ellison is a passionate sailor and maintains a relatively private lifestyle despite his immense fortune. His limited philanthropy score contrasts with his reputation as one of Silicon Valley’s most daring entrepreneurs.With Oracle’s AI-powered rise and his net worth surpassing $393 billion, Ellison has proven that vision and persistence can outlast rivals. Today, at 81, he is not only the richest man alive but also one of the most influential figures shaping the future of technology. His journey from a college dropout to the world’s richest man embodies the spirit of relentless innovation. Ellison’s story serves as a reminder that bold risks, when paired with vision, can rewrite history.","Ellison dethroned elon musk after oracle’s stock soared on the back of massive ai-driven cloud contracts.

Uncle Dennis was furious - Aspiration being late in paying Kawhi Leonard led to Los Angeles Clippers minority owner Dennis Wong's investment,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/uncle-dennis-was-furious-aspiration-being-late-in-paying-kawhi-leonard-led-to-los-angeles-clippers-minority-owner-dennis-wongs-investment/articleshow/123836057.cms,"Kawhi Leonard (Image via Juan Ocampo/NBAE via Getty Images)

Uncle Dennis getting mad over a late payment led to Dennis Wong's involvement with Aspiration

Aspiration employees sacked, but Kawhi Leonard's payment didn't stop

The whole Los Angeles Clippers - Kawhi Leonard - Aspiration drama seems never-ending. Investigative journalist Pablo Torre was the one who first revealed the controversy regarding the Clippers and Leonard's ""no-show"" endorsement day deal with Aspiration. Now, he is back with more information on the same. Allegedly, the company was already facing financial troubles at the end of 2022, when Clippers minority owner Dennis Wong invested around $2 million in the company. Right after that, KL was paid his $1.75 million installment for the quarter. And behind the whole drama was Uncle Dennis, who was reportedly furious that Leonard's payment was late.Aspiration, the fraudulent company, whose bankruptcy documents led to the whole Los Angeles Clippers - Kawhi Leonard alleged under-the-table deal coming to light, was late in paying the player the quarterly installment of $1.75 million. And of course, KL's ""designated representative,"" Dennis Robertson, aka Uncle Dennis, was furious that the payment wasn't made on time. To keep the player and his representation happy, it seems, Clippers minority stakeholder, Dennis Wong, who is also a former roommate of owner Steve Ballmer, invested around $2 million in Aspiration.The company, by then, was already going under. But just about a week after the investment, Leonard received his quarterly payment of $1.75 million for the endorsement deal, for which he never even made any endorsements. This alleged screw-up is something that could lead to the whole conspiracy unraveling, as all eyes fixate on the investigation that's been launched by the NBA on the Clippers and the player.Aspiration let go of 20% of their workforce the very day that Kawhi Leonard received his quarterly payment for the endorsement deal he signed with the company. A former senior executive from the company revealed that Uncle Dennis called Aspiration about the payment at the time, and it was ""beyond shocking"" that an investment was made just a few days later to solve the ""critical"" late payment problem with Kawhi Leonard. They also said:“In all fairness to Uncle Dennis (Robertson), he’s not the only one who’s calling trying to get paid. There’s a huge freeze because there’s no money to be spent. So, from the finance team’s perspective, we feel like we’re on the other end of collections calls. People are constantly coming in asking for their money.”While Leonard's representative was not the only one to make calls, he was one of the few, or probably the only one, who got his payment made after the call was made. All thanks to a timely investment by Dennis Wong, even if a large number of employees had to be let go soon after.Also Read: Kawhi Leonard-Los Angeles Clippers saga takes center court: Adam Silver addresses the press after NBA board of governors meet","Aspiration, the fraudulent company, whose bankruptcy documents led to the whole los angeles clippers - kawhi leonard alleged under-the-table deal coming to light, was late in paying the player the quarterly installment of $1.75 million.

Tejasvi’s vision: Helping seniors navigate the internet safely and confidently

In February 2024, 16-year-old Tejasvi Manoj from Frisco, Texas, faced an experience that would inspire her mission to protect seniors from online scams. While driving home from Scouting America camp with her father, she discovered that her 85-year-old grandfather had received a seemingly urgent email from a distant relative requesting $2,000 to cover an unexpected debt. Ready to comply, he was fortunately stopped by her father’s timely intervention. A quick phone call to the supposed relative confirmed the suspicious request was entirely fraudulent. Witnessing firsthand how easily older adults can fall victim to sophisticated digital scams, Tejasvi was motivated to research the growing global threat of cybercrime targeting seniors and eventually develop Shield Seniors, a comprehensive platform dedicated to educating, empowering, and safeguarding vulnerable older adults online.Tejasvi Manoj is a high school student, accomplished coder, and founder of Shield Seniors, a cybersecurity platform aimed at educating and protecting older adults from online scams. Beyond her technological expertise, she is deeply involved in community service: earning her Eagle Scout rank, volunteering with the North Texas Food Bank Young Advocates Council, tutoring Bhutanese refugees, and performing in her school orchestra.Her parents, both IT professionals, nurtured her early interest in technology. By eighth grade, Tejasvi was fluent in programming languages including Java, Python, and HTML, and actively participated in cybersecurity initiatives like Girls Who Code and Cyber-Patriot. These experiences equipped her to address a pressing social issue using technology.Seniors represent a particularly target-rich demographic for cybercriminals. According to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center, nearly 860,000 reports of online scams were filed in 2024, resulting in potential losses exceeding $16 billion. Fraud directed at individuals over 60 accounted for $5 billion, a 32% increase from the previous year.The Federal Trade Commission reports that losses exceeding $10,000 among older adults quadrupled from 2020 to 2024, while losses over $100,000 increased sevenfold. This alarming trend underscores the urgency for effective solutions to safeguard retirees, pensioners, and seniors from financial exploitation online.Motivated by her grandfather’s experience, Tejasvi developed Shield Seniors, a website designed to empower seniors with knowledge and tools to navigate the digital landscape safely. The platform offers four core sections:The platform prioritises independence and confidence, empowering seniors to navigate the internet safely while reducing reliance on family members for technical support.Creating Shield Seniors required balancing multiple responsibilities. Tejasvi remained active in Scouting America, earned her Eagle Scout rank, played violin in her school orchestra, tutored refugees online, and volunteered in food security initiatives—all while designing and coding the platform.Her work has earned national recognition. She received an honorable mention in the 2024 Congressional App Challenge, delivered a 2025 TEDx talk on bridging digital divides, and became TIME Magazine’s Kid of the Year 2025, also earning the distinction of TIME for Kids Service Star.Tejasvi credits her success to strong mentorship. Her parents provided hands-on support in coding and cybersecurity, while Aarathi Rajamanickam, a software engineering manager, served as a mentor, offering guidance in AI, cybersecurity, and software development. Programs such as Girls Who Code and Cyber-Patriot further honed her technical skills, preparing her to address real-world cybersecurity threats effectively.Currently in private preview mode, Shield Seniors relies on a free AI engine that limits audience capacity. Tejasvi is fundraising to transition to a commercial AI platform to expand access and reach more seniors nationwide. She also plans to conduct in-person workshops at assisted-living facilities, helping older adults gain hands-on experience in cybersecurity.Her vision is clear: to empower seniors to navigate the online world independently, confidently, and safely while educating families on supporting older relatives in protecting themselves from fraud.","Tejasvi manoj, 16, is a high school student, accomplished coder, and founder of shield seniors, a cybersecurity platform aimed at educating and protecting older adults from online scams.

Larry Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle, has officially overtaken Tesla CEO Elon Musk to become the world’s richest man in 2025. Ellison’s net worth soared by an extraordinary $101 billion in a single day, marking the largest one-day wealth increase ever recorded in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His massive fortune now stands at $393 billion, officially surpassing Elon Musk. This dramatic shift was fueled by Oracle’s record-breaking earnings report, which sent the company’s stock price soaring to unprecedented heights. For Musk, the sharp decline in Tesla’s share value has abruptly ended his nearly year-long reign at the very top. The development underscores the powerful link between corporate performance, global stock markets, investor confidence, and the dynamic reshuffling of international billionaire wealth rankings.For the first time in his long career, Larry Ellison has claimed the top position on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. At 81 years old, Ellison’s rise highlights his enduring influence in the tech world and the extraordinary growth of Oracle Corporation. His fortune has now reached $393 billion, surpassing Elon Musk, who had dominated global wealth rankings since 2024.The driving force behind Ellison’s climb was Oracle’s blockbuster earnings report.The company delivered higher-than-expected quarterly results, a surge in bookings, and an ambitious outlook for future growth in cloud services. This fueled a 41% single-day stock rally, the largest in Oracle’s history. Since Ellison holds most of his wealth in Oracle shares, the stock surge translated into an unprecedented $101 billion personal gain.Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s net worth has slipped due to Tesla’s challenges. Shares of the electric vehicle giant are down 13% in 2025, dragging his fortune to $385 billion and ending his nearly year-long reign at the top. Despite the setback, Musk remains a strong contender, with Tesla’s board proposing a performance-based compensation plan that could make him the world’s first trillionaire if he meets aggressive milestones.Ellison’s ascent also underscores Oracle’s growing presence in the cloud computing market, where it is increasingly challenging industry leaders Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. With Ellison serving as chairman and chief technology officer, the company’s bold expansion into cloud infrastructure has redefined its role in global tech and cemented his position as the wealthiest man alive.Larry Ellison is one of the most influential figures in the technology industry, best known as the co-founder, Executive Chairman, and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Oracle Corporation. Oracle, a global leader in enterprise software and cloud computing, was founded in the late 1970s when Ellison and his team pioneered relational database systems that would eventually dominate the market.For nearly four decades, Ellison served as Oracle’s Chief Executive Officer, shaping its rise from a small start-up into one of the world’s most powerful software companies. He stepped down as CEO in 2014 after 37 years at the helm, but unlike many founders who move aside, Ellison retained direct involvement in the company’s innovation strategy. In his role as Executive Chairman and CTO, he continues to steer Oracle’s research, product development, and long-term direction.Ellison also remains the company’s largest shareholder, owning about 41% of Oracle’s outstanding shares, a stake that forms the backbone of his immense personal fortune. This deep tie between his wealth and Oracle’s performance has made his financial trajectory closely mirror the company’s growth.According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Ellison’s fortune now stands at an extraordinary $393 billion as of September 10, 2025. This figure reflects the dramatic one-day surge fueled by Oracle’s earnings report and positions him ahead of Musk, whose net worth is currently estimated at $385 billion.The $101 billion leap was not only historic but also symbolic, highlighting how shifts in the technology sector—particularly the cloud computing race—are reshaping the global wealth rankings. Ellison’s rise to the top underscores both the resilience of Oracle under his leadership and his continued relevance as a driving force in Silicon Valley even at the age of 81.","Larry ellison’s net worth soared by an extraordinary $101 billion in a single day, marking the largest one-day wealth increase ever recorded in the bloomberg billionaires index.
