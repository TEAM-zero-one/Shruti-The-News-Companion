What’s next for her





Canadian entertainer and digital creator Lilly Singh has been officially recognised with an honorary doctorate by her alma mater, York University, a milestone that highlights her transformation from online sensation to mainstream cultural influencer. The award, bestowed during the university’s Fall Convocation on 14 October 2025, reflects Singh’s impact on pop culture, media representation, and diversity advocacy, signalling the growing significance of digital platforms in shaping global cultural narratives.Singh’s career illustrates a broader trend in global media where social media platforms have become launching pads for internationally recognised cultural figures. Beginning as a teenager posting humorous sketches on YouTube under the moniker ‘Superwoman’, she cultivated a large following through content combining comedy, personal reflection, and commentary on cultural identity. This digital prominence opened doors to mainstream television, literature, and public advocacy.Her recognition also highlights evolving metrics of influence. Universities and institutions increasingly acknowledge contributions beyond traditional academic or professional achievements, valuing social reach, advocacy, and public engagement.Singh’s honorary Doctor of Laws degree is emblematic of this shift, recognising the societal and cultural impact of digital creators in ways that transcend conventional accolades.Globally, Singh’s work resonates beyond entertainment. She has amplified conversations about gender equity, representation of minorities in media, and mental health awareness, reaching audiences across North America, Europe, and Asia. Her trajectory offers a lens into how online personalities can shape social norms and public discourse, bridging cultural gaps and challenging stereotypes.On 14 October 2025, York University conferred the honorary Doctor of Laws degree on Singh during its Fall Convocation ceremony. The award cited her “contributions to community building and accomplishments in pop culture and entertainment.” Singh, who graduated from York in 2010 with a degree in psychology, described the honour as “immense”, noting the irony of fulfilling her parents’ long-held expectations of having a ‘doctor’ in the family, albeit in an unconventional manner.Singh’s speech to the graduating class underlined her philosophy on failure and growth. She encouraged students to embrace uncertainty and to view setbacks as teaching moments, asserting that “having it all figured out is a false narrative.” Her address also highlighted her experiences as the child of Indian immigrants navigating cultural expectations while forging a career in entertainment, a journey marked by creativity, resilience, and humour.The milestone comes amid Singh’s continued presence in mainstream media. Beyond her YouTube success, she hostedin 2019, becoming the first woman of Indian descent to lead a late-night talk show on a major American network. She has also authored bestselling books blending personal anecdotes with practical advice, further consolidating her influence across multiple platforms.Singh’s recognition signals the increasing legitimacy of digital creators in shaping cultural narratives. In a media ecosystem historically dominated by traditional broadcast networks and print outlets, social media personalities now influence public opinion, social norms, and even policy discussions on inclusivity and diversity.Her work also underscores the importance of representation. By foregrounding South Asian identity, gender equity, and minority experiences, Singh provides a template for how entertainers can leverage visibility to challenge stereotypes and promote social inclusivity. This has implications not only for entertainment but for broader societal attitudes, encouraging younger audiences to pursue unconventional paths while advocating for equity.Economically, figures like Singh exemplify the monetisation potential of digital platforms. Her trajectory highlights how online content can generate significant revenue streams, sponsorships, and brand partnerships, reshaping employment and entrepreneurship in creative industries. The honorary doctorate amplifies her credibility, reinforcing the notion that influence and impact extend beyond formal qualifications.In a wider sense, platforms such as YouTube, Netflix, and other streaming networks are indirectly implicated, as Singh’s career reinforces the significance of digital-first pathways in the entertainment ecosystem. Social media companies stand to gain from the visibility and credibility conferred upon creators, while advertisers and sponsors can capitalise on the extended reach of influential figures like Singh.Singh’s trajectory is rooted in the rise of social media as a dominant form of entertainment. Launching her YouTube channel as a teenager, she capitalised on the platform’s global reach, producing content that resonated across demographics. Her channel, Superwoman, addressed universal themes of identity, family dynamics, and humour, building a subscriber base of millions within years.The transition from digital creator to mainstream television host represents a significant milestone in entertainment history, reflecting broader shifts in audience behaviour. Singh’s entry into late-night television in 2019 mirrored an era where streaming platforms and online communities began to rival traditional media in shaping celebrity culture and public discourse.Her literary contributions further illustrate this shift. By authoring bestselling books, Singh transformed personal experiences into a public narrative, extending her influence beyond screen-based content and validating digital creators as authors and thought leaders in contemporary culture.Looking ahead, Singh’s recognition is likely to encourage other digital creators to pursue multi-platform careers, blending online content, traditional media, and advocacy. Institutions may increasingly confer honours upon influencers who achieve societal impact, signalling an expanded understanding of cultural contribution.As digital influence continues to evolve, Singh’s journey exemplifies how a YouTuber can transition from niche online content to mainstream recognition, bridging cultural, generational, and geographical divides in the process.","Lilly singh has been officially recognised with an honorary doctorate by her alma mater, york university.

Scale AI shut down an entire team of contractors in its Dallas office this week, marking the latest restructuring at the startup since Mark Zuckerberg's Meta invested $14.3 billion in the company in June. The shuttered team, known internally as the NPO or New Projects Organization, had over a dozen members who focused on generalist tasks such as improving the writing ability of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots.Scale AI attributed the cuts to an industry shift toward more technical, expert-level training work, according to Business Insider. As AI chatbots improve, they increasingly require input from humans with specialised skills in fields like medicine, robotics, and finance, rather than generalist contractors.“Scale wound down a small experimental onsite program in Dallas staffed by a contract workforce,” Scale AI spokesperson Natalia Montalvo said.“This reflects an industry shift toward higher skill, expert data work. It only affects a small fraction of our overall workforce and has no impact on customer delivery,” Montalvo was quoted as saying.Scale AI offered the laid-off workers four weeks of severance pay and healthcare coverage through October, according to an email from HireArt, a staffing agency used extensively by Scale AI.The recently terminated workers were also invited to join Scale's gig-work platform, Outlier, where thousands of freelancers help train AI models.“As you navigate this transition, we want to ensure you are aware of alternative opportunities,” the email stated.Montalvo added that Scale AI continues to expand expert-level programmes and that broader groups of contractors continue to work in Dallas.The Dallas layoffs represent the latest in a series of cuts at Scale AI since the Meta investment. xAI has also made similar moves to focus on specialised AI training, recently downsizing its team of generalist AI tutors in September.",Scale ai shut down an entire team of contractors in its dallas office this week.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has suggested that the types of jobs that are being eliminated or transformed by artificial intelligence (AI) may not be consideredin the long run. During an interview with Rowan Cheung at OpenAI ’s recent DevDay conference, Altman was asked about the possibility of AI destroying almost a billion knowledge-worker jobs before new ones are created. Altman used a thought experiment about a farmer from half a century ago to explain the situation. He said that a farmerAltman suggested that this perspective makes him feelabout the job losses.

MacKenzie Scott’s philanthropic ventures





Focus on diversity and equity causes









MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos , has reduced her stake in the e-commerce company, cutting her holdings by nearly 42% to $12.6 billion, according to a regulatory filing with the SEC filed Tuesday and dated September 30. Many of Scott’s recent philanthropic efforts have focused on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. First reported by Bloomberg, the filing shows that Scott now holds 81.1 million Amazon shares – down 58 million from a year earlier. This reduction occurred despite Amazon shares more than doubling since Scott's 2019 divorce from Bezos.The filing, however, does not specify whether the reduction in Amazon holdings resulted from share sales, donations, or a combination of both, the report said. Under the terms of their divorce agreement, Bezos retains voting authority over Scott's holdings and is required to disclose them annually.With an estimated net worth of $32 billion, Mackenzie Scott obtained most of her wealth following her 2019 divorce from Bezos and has pledged to give away the majority of it. After ending up with approximately 4% of the e-coomerce giant, Scott has given away $19 billion in gifts to more than 2,000 nonprofits over the past five years.The median gift size of her thousands of donations since the divorce is roughly $5 million.As a part of Scott’s philanthropic efforts, one of her most recent donations includes a $42 million gift to 10,000 Degrees, a Bay Area nonprofit expanding college access for low-income and largely non-white students.According to a report by Fortune, this followed a $70 million gift to historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) through the nonprofit UNCF. The program, launched in 2021, aims to help HBCUs close a funding gap compared to white or elite institutions and provide long-term financial stability for minority schools.Furthermore, over the years, Scott has donated to diverse causes including an $84 million gift to Girl Scouts, $20 million to Vermont's Champlain Housing Trust, $436 million to Habitat for Humanity, and $275 million to Planned Parenthood. She previously gave UNCF $10 million in the year 2020.","Mackenzie scott, the ex-wife of amazon co-founder jeff bezos, has reduced her stake in the e-commerce company, cutting her holdings by nearly 42% to $12.6 billion.

AI's ""jagged intelligence"" problem threatens AGI timeline

Major tech players still years away from true AGI





Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has issued a stark warning about artificial intelligence's critical flaw: inconsistency. Speaking on the "" Google for Developers"" podcast, Hassabis revealed that even the most advanced AI systems can ace elite mathematical competitions yet fail at elementary school problems—a vulnerability he says must be fixed before reaching artificial general intelligence (AGI).""It shouldn't be that easy for the average person to just find a trivial flaw in the system,"" Hassabis stated, highlighting how Google's Gemini models enhanced with DeepThink can win gold medals at the International Mathematical Olympiad but ""still make simple mistakes in high school maths.""Hassabis described current AI as having ""uneven intelligences"" or ""jagged intelligences""—excelling brilliantly in some dimensions while being easily exposed in others. This characterization echoes Google CEO Sundar Pichai's term ""AJI"" (artificial jagged intelligence) coined earlier this year to describe systems with uneven capabilities.The DeepMind chief emphasized that solving this inconsistency requires more than just scaling up data and computing power. ""Some missing capabilities in reasoning and planning in memory"" still need to be cracked, he explained, calling for better testing methodologies and ""new, harder benchmarks"" to precisely map AI strengths and weaknesses.Despite predicting AGI's arrival ""in the next five to 10 years"" in April, Hassabis acknowledges significant hurdles remain. His concerns align with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman 's recent assessment following GPT-5's launch, where Altman admitted the model lacks continuous learning capabilities—something he considers essential for true AGI.The warnings underscore a growing recognition among AI leaders that current systems' propensity for hallucinations, misinformation, and basic errors must be addressed before achieving human-level reasoning—a cautionary tale reminiscent of social media platforms' early failures to anticipate consequences at scale.",Google deepmind ceo demis hassabis has issued a stark warning about artificial intelligence's critical flaw: inconsistency.

Rise of Chinese AI chip companies

China to tech companies: You cannot buy AI chips from Nvidia





Nvidia, the American semiconductor giant, has seen its dominance in China’s advanced chip market vanish, with its market share dropping from 95% to Zero due to stringent US export controls, according to CEO Jensen Huang. Speaking at a Citadel Securities event in New York earlier this month, Huang revealed that Nvidia is completely barred from selling its high-performance AI chips, including the A100, H100, and H200 models, to Chinese companies since restrictions began in 2022.A video of the interview was released recently. Huang expressed hope for a policy shift, stating, “We will continue to explain and inform and hold on to hope for a change in policy.” He emphasized that Nvidia’s exclusion from China not only harms the company but also has broader implications for both China and the U.S. “What harms China could oftentimes also harm America, and even worse,” Huang said. He further highlighted China’s significant role in global AI development, with roughly 50% of the world’s AI researchers.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's remarks come as China carries on with a nationwide push for semiconductor self-sufficiency.Chinese AI and semiconductor contenders have rushed to launch domestic alternatives, eroding Nvidia’s once-dominant market share. Huawei’s advancements, including clustering methods to bypass Nvidia’s technology and cutting-edge manufacturing techniques, signal China’s aggressive push for semiconductor self-sufficiency.Despite receiving US approval to sell a less powerful H20 chip tailored for the Chinese market, Nvidia faces further challenges. Chinese authorities launched a security investigation into the H20, and local clients were advised to avoid the product, further limiting Nvidia’s foothold. Huang warned that excluding Nvidia from China risks ceding the market to domestic competitors like Huawei Technologies, which recently unveiled an ambitious AI chip roadmap.“It’s a mistake not to have those researchers build AI on American technology,” Huang said, raising concerns about balancing U.S. technological leadership with global collaboration. As China accelerates its domestic chip development, Nvidia’s absence from the market could reshape the global AI and semiconductor landscape.Nvidia recently got shut out of the Chinese market after China’s internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, reportedly banned domestic tech companies from buying Nvidia AI chips. According to a report by Financial Times, the Chinese agency also told tech companies, including TikTok-parent ByteDance and Alibaba, to stop testing and ordering Nvidia’s RTX Pro 6000D server, a device designed specifically for the market in China.","N nvidia's market share in china has dropped from 95% to zero, according to ceo jensen huang.

Sales roles protected while support jobs disappear









Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is delivering contradictory messages about AI's role in the workplace. While his company recently eliminated 4,000 customer support positions in favor of AI agents, he told TBPN, a live daily YouTube show, this week that AI lacks something essential for sales roles—insisting artificial intelligence cannot replace human salespeople because it lacks the irreplaceable value of face-to-face communication.""AI doesn't have a soul. It's not that human connectivity,"" Benioff said, emphasising that face-to-face communication remains essential. Despite his company's aggressive AI deployment, he's now hiring between 3,000 and 5,000 new salespeople, aiming to reach 20,000 account executives this year.The hiring announcement comes months after Marc Benioff revealed on The Logan Bartlett Show podcast in September that Salesforce had slashed its customer support workforce from 9,000 to approximately 5,000 employees. ""I need less heads,"" he stated bluntly, explaining that AI agents now handle 50% of customer interactions that humans once managed.The job cuts have proven financially beneficial for Salesforce, reducing support costs by 17% since early 2025. The company's AI agents have completed over a million customer conversations, demonstrating the technology's capability to replace human workers in certain functions.Marc Benioff's distinction between roles reveals a strategic vision: AI can handle routine support tasks, but complex sales relationships still require human touch. He pointed to networking at Salesforce's Dreamforce conference as proof, noting the St. Regis Hotel bar was ""filled"" with customers ""talking to each other and connecting, going more deeply, having that human touch.""The CEO's stance contrasts sharply with broader industry trends, where over 64,000 tech workers have been laid off this year. Companies including Microsoft, Meta, and Google have all reduced headcount while investing heavily in AI, with customer service and sales roles ranking among the most vulnerable positions to automation.Benioff maintains this isn't dystopian but ""reality,"" even as his company exemplifies the dual nature of AI's workplace impact: eliminating some jobs while supposedly protecting others based on perceived irreplaceability of human connection.","Salesforce ceo marc benioff is delivering contradictory messages about ai's role in the workplace.

RTA business model to support domestic business





Local and international businesses now have the opportunity to operate inside Dubai’s bustling metro and tram stations, as the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) opens retail and commercial leasing opportunities across the network.The initiative aims to boost economic activity and give daily commuters easier access to services while strengthening partnerships between the public and private sectors. RTA said that several successful collaborations with private firms in the past have encouraged the expansion of this investment model.Businesses interested in setting up shop in the emirate’s transport hubs can apply online through RTA’s official portal:Among the latest opportunities are retail outlets at metro stations along the Route 2020 extension, which serves fast-growing residential and commercial areas such as Jebel Ali, The Gardens, Discovery Gardens, Al Furjan, Jumeirah Golf Estates, Dubai Investment Park, and the Expo 2020 site. The RTA has allocated 40 retail outlets spanning 15,860 square feet and five sales kiosks for commercial use across these stations. The 15-kilometre Route 2020 corridor was designed to serve over 270,000 residents, with capacity for 46,000 riders per hour in both directions.According to RTA projections, daily ridership is expected to reach 125,000 passengers initially and 275,000 passengers per day by 2030. The Expo Station alone is forecast to handle around 35,000 weekday visitors and 47,000 visitors on weekends, accounting for nearly 30% of Expo’s total daily attendance.The Jumeirah Golf Estates Station, at 27,000 square metres, is the largest station on the network and can accommodate up to 250,000 riders per day. The facility serves neighbouring communities including Dubai Production City and Dubai Sports City.RTA officials said retail outlets along metro lines not only enhance the commuter experience but also stimulate local business by integrating urban mobility with trade.

China and Russia reportedly using ‘sex warfare’ to spy on Silicon Valley; Elon Musk reacts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/china-and-russia-reportedly-using-sex-warfare-to-spy-on-silicon-valley-elon-musk-reacts/articleshow/124771871.cms,"The big picture

Why it matters

Key players and stakes

Historical context





Silicon Valley, the heart of global innovation, has found itself at the centre of a new kind of cold war, one not fought with code or cyber weapons, but with charm, seduction, and manipulation. A report by The Times (UK) has revealed claims that Chinese and Russian operatives are using “sex warfare” to infiltrate America’s technology industry and extract sensitive trade secrets. The revelations have reignited global concerns over espionage, national security, and the vulnerability of the world’s most powerful innovation ecosystem.Elon Musk, whose companies straddle defence, space, and artificial intelligence, reacted to the revelations on X (formerly Twitter) with humour: “If she’s a 10, you’re an asset.”The allegations centre on what experts call a growing pattern of human intelligence (HUMINT) operations targeting US technology hubs. Intelligence officers from China and Russia are reportedly using personal and romantic relationships to obtain trade secrets, intellectual property, and even defence-related data.This emerging espionage strategy, dubbed “sex warfare,” exploits emotional and social vulnerabilities rather than digital ones.Instead of hacking servers, spies allegedly seduce or befriend employees at major technology firms, gaining access to confidential systems, passwords, and internal networks.According to the US National Counterintelligence and Security Center (NCSC), such operations represent a “fusion of human and cyber espionage” — a hybrid model that combines psychological manipulation with data theft. For a region as open and collaborative as Silicon Valley, this marks an unprecedented threat.The phenomenon is reportedly expanding beyond California, with similar infiltration attempts observed in Austin, Boston, and Seattle, as the United States’ technology and defence industries decentralise into new hubs.James Mulvenon, Chief Intelligence Officer at Pamir Consulting, said that he had noticed a “significant rise” in suspicious online connections, especially on professional platforms such as LinkedIn.Mulvenon described instances of uninvited individuals attempting to access security and defence-related conferences, which he viewed as evidence of a systematic campaign. “It’s a real vulnerability,” he warned, highlighting that Silicon Valley’s culture of openness and trust provides fertile ground for human-driven espionage.Geopolitically, the trend underscores the escalating competition between the United States, China, and Russia over technological supremacy in artificial intelligence, semiconductors, and defence systems. With Washington tightening export controls on advanced chips and both Beijing and Moscow seeking to offset those restrictions, espionage remains a powerful tool of strategic parity.Economically, the costs are enormous. The Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property estimates that trade secret and intellectual property theft cost the US economy up to $600 billion a year, with China responsible for the majority of reported cases. Such theft undermines innovation, weakens investor confidence, and distorts global competition.Socially, the so-called “sex warfare” phenomenon illustrates how espionage has become deeply personal, targeting individuals’ emotions and trust instead of their devices. This blurring of personal and professional boundaries complicates both workplace ethics and national security oversight.For Silicon Valley, the threat lies not only in potential breaches but in reputational damage. As espionage becomes more human-centred, firms are being pushed to reinforce their defences beyond firewalls — into awareness training, background screening, and behavioural monitoring.China has repeatedly been accused by US authorities of pursuing large-scale technology and intellectual property theft through both cyberattacks and human networks. Beijing has denied the allegations, calling them “politically motivated.”Russia continues to rely on its traditional expertise in psychological and interpersonal manipulation, reportedly adapting “honeypot” tactics to target venture investors and data scientists in the tech sector.The United States faces the difficult task of defending its innovation ecosystem while maintaining openness. Agencies such as the FBI and NCSC have expanded outreach to Silicon Valley firms, warning them of sophisticated social-engineering methods.The use of seduction as a spycraft tactic is not new. During the Cold War, Soviet intelligence services famously deployed “swallows” and “ravens” — agents trained to cultivate relationships with Western officials to gain access to sensitive information.More recently, cases such as Anna Chapman (a Russian spy arrested in 2010) and Christine Fang (a suspected Chinese operative linked to political circles in California) show that romantic or personal infiltration remains a fixture of modern espionage.Today, with private technology companies holding data and research of national importance, the battleground has shifted from government corridors to corporate campuses. Silicon Valley’s openness — once its strength — now doubles as a liability.","Claims that chinese and russian operatives are using ‘sex warfare’ to infiltrate america’s technology industry and extract sensitive trade secrets.

Meet Siddhartha Patel Daswani: 17-year-old Indian-American fighting wildfires with AI,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/meet-siddhartha-patel-daswani-17-year-old-indian-american-fighting-wildfires-with-ai/articleshow/124769281.cms,"

How the AI tool helps predict and prevent wildfires

How AI is reshaping wildfire management



Beyond technology: turning awareness into action

Global recognition and policy impact

A global youth leader for climate innovation





A 17-year-old Indian-origin student, Siddhartha Patel Daswani, is gaining global recognition for using artificial intelligence to combat one of the planet’s most destructive environmental threats: wildfires. Through his initiative, SmokeSignal, Daswani has developed a suite of AI tools capable of detecting and predicting wildfires in real time, providing critical early warnings that can help save lives, forests, and ecosystems. What began as a childhood response to the 2017 Napa wildfires has now evolved into a global climate technology platform that blends AI innovation, youth education, and environmental policy advocacy, according to a report by The New India Abroad.Siddhartha’s journey began when he was just 10 years old, after massive wildfires in California darkened the skies above his home for days. That experience left a lasting mark. “For 36 hours, the sun disappeared,” he recalls. “That moment changed me. I knew I had to do something to prevent this from becoming normal.”Driven by that experience, Siddhartha founded SmokeSignal, a youth-led organisation using AI to identify smoke patterns and predict the spread of wildfires.The first model detects smoke from satellite imagery, providing early alerts without the need for expensive on-ground sensors. The second model, trained on over 831 million data points from six US government agencies, forecasts how fires will spread within 60 seconds.SmokeSignal’s predictive tools go beyond traditional detection systems, offering real-time analysis that supports firefighters and emergency planners. The algorithms process massive environmental datasets, such as wind speed, vegetation type, and temperature, to forecast how a fire could evolve. This allows first responders to plan evacuations and containment strategies faster and more accurately.The organisation is now partnering with fire departments in Hawaii and California to field-test its AI detection system and aims to offer zero-cost access to more than 20 departments worldwide. By removing financial barriers, SmokeSignal seeks to ensure that developing countries can also benefit from the technology.Siddhartha’s vision extends beyond algorithms. SmokeSignal also focuses on education and community mobilisation, training young people to take local climate action. The organisation has hosted wildfire prevention seminars on four continents, from Los Angeles and Maui to Zambia, Argentina, and India.Its reforestation initiative, powered by over 50,000 youth volunteers, has already planted 45,000 trees across Kenya, India, and the US In addition, Daswani launched the “Be the Change Incubator”, which trains students across Asia, Africa, and North America to create their own sustainability projects.“Technology is powerful,” he says, “but when combined with education and community action, it becomes unstoppable.”Siddhartha’s work has attracted attention from both scientists and policymakers. Collaborating with Stanford University and the Santa Clara County FireSafe Council, he helped develop a new framework for prescribed burns that integrates Indigenous fire stewardship methods. This system has already been implemented in more than 100 controlled burns across 40,000 acres.His research also contributed to a federal climate policy brief proposing updates to the US Clean Air Act to include controlled burns as an official mitigation strategy. “Siddhartha is a wonderful young man, poised, thoughtful, and full of infectious enthusiasm for AI and wildfire prevention,” said Seth Schalet, CEO of the Santa Clara County FireSafe Council.Today, Daswani serves as the youngest honorary board member of the Santa Clara FireSafe Council and as a national ambassador for BAPS Charities, where he advocates for combining mindfulness and environmental responsibility. Through temple-based programs, he has inspired more than 200 children weekly to engage in environmental learning and service.As his AI systems expand globally, Siddhartha remains grounded in his mission. “Technology alone can’t solve the climate crisis; it’s people who make the difference,” he says. “My goal is to empower every young person to believe their ideas can save lives.”","Siddhartha patel daswani, 17, is gaining global recognition for using artificial intelligence to combat wildfires.

Implant helps to restore reading for people with atrophic AMD

Collaboration and persistence reap reward

Chip implantation: Not an easy operation





Restoring vision — or at least improving it — for those with macular degeneration may soon be possible with a tiny chip and special glasses.Together, the chip and eyeglasses have been shown to restore central vision for a type of eye disease, known as Age-related macular degeneration (AMD).More than 80% of patients at trial sites across the United States, Germany, UK, Netherlands and Italy showed significant improvement in central vision following a year of monitoring.With the implant, the patients were able to read numbers and words at home and could improve their reading ability by 25 letters — or five lines — on a standard eye exam chart.The majority of participants, who were aged over 50 years, had their vision improved to about half as good as the standard 20/20 vision.""It's the first time ever where it has been shown that vision can be restored in a blind retinal area that is important for daily life,"" Frank Holz, the study's lead and the chair of ophthalmology at the University of Bonn, told DW.As some people age, the macula, which is the part of the retina responsible for central vision, can deteriorate, leading first to vision blurring and then ongoing degeneration. Atrophic AMD is a leading cause of sight loss in older people, affecting at least five million people globally.A healthy eye can 'see' by receiving light from the outside world and converting it into electrical signals that are sent via the optic nerve into the brain for interpretation. Macular degeneration reduces the eye's ability to do this.The solution of implanting a pinhead-sized chip into the retina that can compensate for this deterioration inspired Daniel Palanker, an ophthalmologist at Stanford University, US. He collaborated with French eye expert Jose-Alain Sahel, based at the Pittsburgh School of Medicine, on developing the technology. They wanted to develop an implant that would do away with under-skin wires and appointed Holz to lead the latest trial.But the chip is only one half of what they call the ""PRIMA"" system.The other half is the specialized set of eyeglasses. They use a mounted camera to transmit visual data to the implant, which beams the data to a handheld processor for enhancement, and then receives higher-quality imagery back.The images are converted to electrical impulses and utilize the remaining retinal cells to send the information to the brain.""It requires, importantly in this disease, that the biocomputer, if you will — the [biological] wiring anterior to the chip — is still present,"" said Holz, referring to still-functioning cells in the eye.""If all cells from the retina were dead, the chip wouldn't work at all. It [the implant] just replaces the photoreceptors and basically translates light into electric stimuli, which is what nature does in the eye with the retina.""Sahel and Stanford-based Palanker had been working on separate technologies to try addressing the same problem when they met at a conference in 2012.They decided to pool their resources to develop the implant, first with small studies with several patients and then this larger trial with more than 30.But the current study nearly collapsed when the company developing PRIMA went out of business in 2024.""I remember vividly the days not so long ago, when everything was just about to die at the time when the study was almost complete,"" Sahel told DW. ""There might have been a situation where you have a product that is working and there is no way to get it to the people.""The developer has since been acquired by US company Science Corporation, which has taken over production and is seeking approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use as a medical therapy in the US, and CE certification for use in Europe.By conducting the trial across multiple countries and sites, the trial team is hopeful approval will be achieved in both regions.""You want to demonstrate that the technology is not just limited to one or two very skilled surgeons,"" Sahel told DW. ""And that also patients from multiple backgrounds can benefit from it.""It is an essential criterion for regulators that researchers show that difficult operations such as this implantation can be successfully performed by eye surgeons. While some adverse effects were reported in some patients, these cleared up by the end of the 12-month study period.""Demonstrating that across 13 different sites and different surgeons there was some consistency in the results gives the ability to apply to get that distributed to more centers and more patients,"" Sahel said.Sahel and Holz both highlighted that there are limitations to the new technology. While the operation to implant the chip had now been successfully performed by multiple surgeons around the world, they told DW it was not an easy operation.""It's a very complex surgery that needs good skills,"" Sahel said.The other challenge is the patient. There are logistical barriers that could affect patient suitability, such as their ability to repeatedly visit a clinic for post-surgery rehabilitation, and to have at-home support during this period.Holz said an implant recipient must be willing to have ongoing post-surgery review, and be trained to use the camera and processor to be able to successfully use the implant.That rehabilitation program currently takes around 12 months.","Pinhead-sized chip and special glasses have been shown to restore central vision for age-related macular degeneration.

Final thoughts on Saudi’s Green Card





Saudi Arabia’s Premium Residency Permit has introduced an affordable and attractive entry point with its SAR 4,000 fee category under five specialized residency tracks launched in January 2024. Designed to attract global talent, the Premium Residency allows expatriates to live, work, invest, and own property in Saudi Arabia without a local sponsor, providing freedom to innovate and invest while offering pathways to permanent residency.Launched in 2019 and expanded in 2024, the program now includes seven distinct tracks tailored to various profiles. Here is a detailed look at the five routes to the SAR 4,000 Premium Residency Permit:Applicants approved under these categories pay a one-time issuance fee of SAR 4,000 (around US $1065), instead of the older higher fees - SAR 100,000 per year for limited-duration residency or SAR 800,000 for unlimited/permanent residency. The reduced fee applies only to those who meet the specific conditions for each track, offering a cost-effective option tailored to professionals, creatives, investors, and property owners.These tracks cater to highly skilled individuals and wealth holders who can prove their specialized qualifications or investments, providing access to Saudi Arabia with a much lower financial barrier but higher eligibility standards.These privileges represent a substantial upgrade compared to typical work/residency permits (iqama), offering greater autonomy, security, and long-term integration possibilities.Meeting these conditions is mandatory to benefit from the SAR 4,000 issuance fee privilege.Failure to respond to queries within 60 days or non-compliance can lead to rejection.The Premium Residency under SAR 4,000 tracks can be cancelled for:Applicants and families have a grace period of up to 60 days (extensible to 180 days) to settle affairs after cancellation.Saudi Arabia’s SAR 4,000 Premium Residency products open a unique strategic gateway for expatriates and investors to enjoy significant residency privileges, provided they meet the specialized criteria tied to talent, investment, entrepreneurship, or long-term property ownership.While the issuance fee is substantially more affordable compared to previous Premium Residency fees, applicants must satisfy specific financial eligibility conditions that vary by track, such as minimum salary requirements for special talents, minimum investment amounts for investors and entrepreneurs, or property value thresholds for real estate owners. These financial criteria ensure that only qualified individuals who contribute to the Kingdom’s long-term economic growth and socioeconomic development can benefit from this cost-effective, exclusive pathway.For those interested in applying or needing personalized advice, consulting with legal and immigration professionals specializing in Saudi residency programs is recommended.","Saudi's premium residency program includes five different routes costing sar 4,000.

Big Relief For Indians: Donald Trump Clarifies $100K H-1B Fee Won’t Apply To Existing Visa Holders

Is it a loophole?



OPT to H-1B







As the USCIS issued further clarification on who is exempt from the $100,000 H-1B visa fee, several Indian lobbies and immigration attorneys celebrated the 'massive loophole' that makes students on an F1 visa exempt from the fee. The USCIS clarified that individuals who are already in the United States and are seeking a change of status to an H-1B, extension of stay or amendment (a change in the employer) won't require the fee.""MASSIVE loophole. You come as a visitor/student/other nonimmigrant visa, you don't need to pay the fee, even if you travel afterward to obtain an H-1B visa,"" immigration lawyer Charles Kuck posted in X.Indian-origin techie Deedy Das wrote: ""HUGE Immigration News! $100k H-1B fee will not apply to students changing their status from F-1. That mainly targets WITCH IT companies that do this, who are planning on using the L-1 instead. If you studied in the US, the fee doesn’t affect you. I’m now positive on this rule!""According to experts, it is not a loophole and the $100,000 H-1B visa fee policy targets foreign graduates, not those who study in the US. In fact, this will bring back foreign students to the US in a reversal of the present trend of students choosing universities in the UK, Germany, or Ireland instead of US universities due to uncertainties.Optional Practical Training is a program that allows international students in the US on an F-1 visa to work temporarily in their field of study after graduation. The OPT status can continue for a year after graduation and can be extended for STEM students for another two years. If they have to change their status to H-1B, once they are hired by companies, the companies will have to pay the normal fee, not the $100,000.","Uscis issues further clarification on who is exempt from the $100,000 h-1b visa fee.
