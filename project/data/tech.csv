NEW DELHI: Barely hours after its introduction on Wednesday, Lok Sabha passed a bill to not only prohibit online games played with money but also regulate, promote and encourage the sector to ensure a ""developed, safe and responsible"" digital environment for all citizens.The proposed legislation - Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025 - was passed without a debate by a voice vote amid din as opposition members raised slogans demanding a discussion on Bihar SIR.Once the legislation becomes a law after being passed by RS and receiving presidential assent, offering or facilitating online money gaming will be punishable by jail of up to 3 years and/or a fine of up to Rs 1 crore.Moving the bill, Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said govt seeks to encourage e-sports and online social gaming that do not involve money and will set up an authority for the purpose. Vaishnaw introduced the bill amid sloganeering by opposition members during the first half, when the House assembled after the first adjournment.He said online money gaming has become a matter of concern as such platforms have led to addiction among youth and have also been used for fraud and cheating.Justifying the govt's move to ban online money gaming, the minister, in the statement of object and reasons of the bill, said the unchecked and widespread proliferation of such games, which are readily accessible through mobile devices and computers, and offer monetary returns in exchange for deposited funds has led to ""grave social, economic, and psychological consequences across the country"". tnn","Lok sabha passes bill to prohibit online games played with money.

"People lose Rs 20,000 crore per year in online gaming: Data",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/people-lose-rs-20000-crore-per-year-in-online-gaming-data/articleshow/123418963.cms,"NEW DELHI: Much against the arguments put forth by gaming companies against the ban on real-money gaming, the government estimates that around 45 crore people lose close to Rs 20,000 crore every year in online real-money gaming, according to data provided by an official source on Wednesday.The source said the government believes that online real-money gaming is turning into a ""major problem for society,"" and decided to prioritise people's welfare over the revenue loss it will suffer on account of the ban. ""There is a rough estimate that 45 crore people lose money every year. Total impact of the loss is estimated to be around Rs 20,000 crore,"" the source said, on a day when the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025 was tabled and passed in the Lok Sabha.""Every parliamentarian has raised concerns about the ill effects of online gaming involving money. Between revenue from one-third of the industry segment and social welfare, the government has chosen welfare of society,"" the source said.The bill proposes to promote e-sports and online social gaming while banning money gaming in any form. ""There will be a budget for it, and schemes and authority for their promotion.They comprise two-thirds of the industry. It will create job opportunities for the online gaming industry,"" the source said.Action under the bill against entities involved in money gaming will be taken mainly by state govts.Any person offering an online money gaming service in violation of stipulated provisions will face imprisonment of up to three years or a fine that may extend to Rs 1 crore, or both. The provisions also stipulate imprisonment of up to two years and/or a fine of up to Rs 50 lakh, or both, for those putting out advertisements in contravention of rules.Several online real-money gaming platforms ""masquerade as game of skills"" entities to differentiate themselves from gambling or betting, the source said. ""Those who play the games are victims. They will not be punished as per the bill, but there will be action against those who provide real-money gaming platforms, facilitate transaction services, etc,"" the source said.The government has been making efforts for the last three-and-a-half years, which were being bypassed by the real-money gaming players.""Government tried to check it through GST, but it was being bypassed.

Noel Tata’s mother and former Tata Group director Simone Tata in critical condition,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/noel-tatas-mother-and-former-tata-group-director-simone-tata-in-critical-condition/articleshow/123375513.cms,"Simone Tata made a rare public appearance at the launch of the revamped flagship Westside store in South Mumbai in October 2019.

MUMBAI: Simone Tata, the mother of Tata Trusts chairman Noel Tata, is in critical condition at the Breach Candy Hospital, sources with direct knowledge of the matter told TOI.She was airlifted from Dubai to Mumbai on Monday and is under the care of doctor Farokh Udwadia.Simone, 95, is fighting several symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, the same illness that her stepson and former Tata Group chairman Ratan Tata passed away from last October.“She and Noel arrived in Mumbai from Dubai on a medical plane at Terminal 8,” the sources said.Simone is most famous for turning the Lakmé cosmetic brand into a well-known household name in India. The name Lakmé comes from the French word for Lakshmi, a goddess known for her beauty in Hindu mythology.The Tata Group was urged by former Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru to launch a makeup brand after learning that Indian women were spending the country’s foreign reserves on Western makeup brands. Lakmé was established by the Tata Group in 1952.Originally from Geneva, Switzerland, Simone first visited India as a tourist in the summer of 1953 at the age of 23. During her visit, she met Naval Tata, who was 26 years her senior and divorced from his first wife Soonoo.They fell in love, got married in 1955, and she decided to make Mumbai her permanent home.In 1996, the Tata Group sold Lakmé to Hindustan Unilever as part of a restructuring strategy. Simone used the proceeds from the sale to create Westside, a popular department store where many Indians shop.She managed the Tata Group’s consumer-facing businesses including Lakme and Trent (which owns Westside and Star India Bazaar stores) for over four decades until her retirement in 2006. She also served on the board of Tata Industries, an important investment company within the Tata Group.After her retirement, Simone made fewer public appearances. In October 2019, she was seen in a wheelchair at the opening of the renovated flagship Westside store in South Mumbai. In September 2022, she attended the funeral of former Tata Group chairman Cyrus Mistry (Noel is married to Cyrus’s sister Aloo Mistry), and in October 2024, she was present at Ratan’s funeral.Following Ratan’s passing, Noel took over his position at Tata Trusts, the driving force behind the $180-billion Tata Group.","Simone tata, the mother of tata trusts chairman noel tata, is in critical condition.

Is Roblox really shutting down after backlash and ongoing scrutiny?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/news/is-roblox-really-shutting-down-after-backlash-and-ongoing-scrutiny/articleshow/123382058.cms,"(Image via Getty Images)

Is Roblox shutting down?



""While this was not an easy choice, we believe it is in the best interest of our community. We want to thank everyone who has been part of this journey. Your voices have been heard, and your well-being remains our top priority.""

""Effective September Ist, the platform will no longer be available,""

What can lead to Roblox finally being shut down in 2025?



A viral notice that claims Roblox will shut down on September 1, 2025, permanently has ignited a panic among its players. The message in the notice cited Roblox safety concerns and the popular demand for the platform to shut down, as the reasons behind their step. This notice that now seems to be all over X, is coming at a time when Roblox is facing legal scrutiny and international bans. So, is this the end of the popular gaming platform, or is it just a part of the recurring hoax?Here is all we know about the circulating news and whether or not it is officially true.An official-looking announcement, stating Roblox is shutting down, has spread rapidly on X. It states that Roblox made a decision to shut down permanently from September 1, 2025, due to user demand and security concerns. The official announcement further stated,While the announcement that seemed to be official, stated,there is still no news of whether or not it is true. Quite crucially, no official confirmation has been received about this from Roblox.This is not the first time that rumors of Roblox shutting down have surfaced all over social media. In the past, Roblox repeatedly denied the claims of Roblox shutdown rumors, calling it a hoax and giving reassurances to the players that the game “isn’t going anywhere.”What’s interesting about the current circulating claims is that Roblox has been under a lot of pressure. From demands for the Roblox CEO resignation to changes in their policies and even the drop in the share price of Roblox, fans speculate that this time, the news can be true.Even the lack of denial or immediate confirmation from the end of Roblox is quite unusual. It has left this situation ambiguous, with players awaiting an official statement soon.While Roblox isn’t any stranger to controversies, the recent lawsuits against the platform by the state of Louisiana, accusing it of failing to protect the young crowd from inappropriate content and predators, have taken a major toll. Games like Escape to Epstein Island and Diddy Party have also been cited as examples of Roblox explicit content that have been accessible to minors.The lawsuit was not an isolated incident. Many countries, including Turkey, China, and Oman, have banned the platform. Now with Qatar's recent Roblox ban, after social media pushing to take action, over the platform's rising child safety concerns, have brought a lot of Roblox legal troubles. Critics argue that the rapid growth of Roblox has outpaced the platform’s ability to enforce needed moderation. While Roblox did bring in safety measures, including Roblox AI monitoring, there are many who believe all these measures are just reactive and not preventative.In short, with the Roblox international bans, lawsuits, and the play-led boycotts, like #BoycottTheHatch,” Roblox has been facing mounting pressure. The recent viral notice circulating about Roblox shutting down—whether fake or real—shows increased frustration amongst the users, critics and concerned citizens.As of now, the gaming platform remains operational, with millions of gamers aiming for it to be the same. However, the company being silent on the latest rumors is quite concerning. In case the legal actions do succeed, some stricter regulations can force major changes or, worse, can make the platform back off by finally shutting it down.","A viral notice that claims roblox will shut down on september 1, 2025, permanently has ignited a panic among its players.

What counts as e-sports under the Online Gaming Bill 2025 ?

National e-Sports Authority to regulate, promote, and oversee the gaming industry

Oversee and promote competitive gaming.

Register online social games (the casual, non-money kind).

Issue rules for fair play, safety, and compliance.

Work with state governments to integrate e-sports into local policies.

Complete ban on money-based online games with penalties for violators

The Online Gaming Bill 2025 brings A new era for India’s gamers

India is making big moves in the world of online gaming. On Tuesday, the Cabinet approved the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025, officially giving e-sports a stronger place in the country while also drawing hard lines around money-driven platforms. The bill, now headed to Parliament, is being seen as a game-changer for competitive gaming, players, and the industry at large.E-sports have been defined as competitive skill-based games played in virtual arenas with recognized rules and standards. The government is now considering professional tournaments, organized competitions, and gaming as a sport.This definition separates e-sports from online gambling-style games, which the bill calls “money games,” which are titles where cash or valuables are at stake. Those, unlike e-sports, fall under a completely different category and face strict restrictions.The government had already recognized e-sports in 2022 as a multisport event under the Youth Affairs and Sports Ministry, but the new bill aims to take that recognition further with structured promotion and regulation.A major highlight of the Online Gaming Bill 2025 is the creation of a National e-Sports Authority. This central body will:Officials say this will also open doors for foreign investment, job creation, and international tournaments hosted in India.The Online Gaming Bill 2025 doesn’t just promote e-sports; it also cracks down on harmful gaming practices. Anyone caught promoting or betting within e-sports or social games could face fines or even jail time. Lawmakers argue the move is about protecting players from exploitation while supporting a healthy gaming culture.From the ESL India Premiership to the Commonwealth Esports Championship, Indian teams have already proven their potential. With government support now locked in, the bill could open doors for more sponsorships, global tournaments, and professional pathways for gamers.","The cabinet approved the promotion and regulation of online gaming bill, 2025 on tuesday.

Implications for Indian Sport

Boost for Esports

The Lok Sabha on Wednesday passed the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025, amid protests by the Opposition. The legislation, which seeks to promote and regulate the online gaming sector, has drawn contrasting reactions — delighting the esports industry but sparking alarm in the multi-billion-dollar real money gaming market.The House was adjourned till Thursday following noisy protests, while the Rajya Sabha was adjourned till tomorrow. Despite the disruption, the Bill went through, creating a landmark moment for one of India’s fastest-growing industries.The legislation proposes the creation of a central regulatory body to oversee four key segments: esports, educational games, social gaming, and real money gaming. Among these, real money gaming platforms — such as poker and fantasy sports — face the biggest blow.The Bill’s “Prohibitions” clause states: “No person shall offer, aid, abet, induce or otherwise indulge or engage in the offering of online money game and online money gaming service.” It further bans banks and financial institutions from processing transactions for such platforms.Under the “Offences and Penalties” clause, service providers found offering real money games could face up to three years’ imprisonment or fines of up to Rs 1 crore.Advertising such platforms could also invite jail terms of up to two years or fines of Rs 50 lakh.The government defended the move, citing widespread social and financial harms: “The proliferation of online money games…offering monetary returns against user deposits has led to serious social, financial, psychological and public health harms, particularly among young individuals and economically disadvantaged groups.”Cricket, which has seen a surge in real money gaming sponsorships, stands to be most affected. Dream11, India’s team sponsor, pays approximately Rs 358 crore, while My11Circle holds IPL fantasy rights worth Rs 625 crore over five years. Several leading cricketers also hold personal endorsement deals with these companies.Sports lawyer Vidushpat Singhania noted: “Cricket is huge in India and there won’t be any dearth of sponsors for Indian cricket. However, personal sponsorship market can shrink because of this bill. Fan engagement will also be affected.” He added that fantasy apps might shift to subscription-based models, though revenues will likely fall.For the esports fraternity, however, the Bill is being hailed as a breakthrough. “The government’s intent to recognise and promote esports…is an encouraging step towards building a structured and globally competitive ecosystem,” Akshat Rathee, Co-founder and MD of NODWIN Gaming, told PTI.As esports prepares for its Olympic debut in 2027, the Bill could provide the sector with long-awaited legitimacy — marking a new era for gaming in India.","The lok sabha passed the promotion and regulation of online gaming bill, 2025.

Vancouver Canucks cool off interest in NHL free agent Jack Roslovic amid search for center depth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/vancouver-canucks-cool-off-interest-in-nhl-free-agent-jack-roslovic-amid-search-for-center-depth/articleshow/123418874.cms,"AP/Adrian Kraus

NHL free agent Jack Roslovic no longer a top target for Vancouver Canucks

Jack Roslovic’s NHL free agency outlook and market value in 2025 offseason

The Vancouver Canucks appear to be moving on from NHL free agent Jack Roslovic, who remains one of the top unsigned players on the market. Despite discussions last month, the Canucks have reportedly cooled off on pursuing the 28-year-old forward, according to The Athletic’s Thomas Drance. Instead, the organization is shifting its focus toward securing a long-term solution down the middle via the trade market.The Canucks had been linked to Roslovic multiple times over the past two offseasons, including last summer before he signed a one-year, $2.8 million contract with the Carolina Hurricanes. That deal proved successful for the forward, as he matched his career-high with 22 goals in 81 games while playing more minutes at center than in prior seasons.However, despite his proven offensive ability and versatility, Vancouver’s front office appears to be prioritizing a more permanent addition to their lineup. The team wants stability behind star Elias Pettersson and the talented but injury-prone Filip Chytil. Drance reported that the Canucks would be willing to execute a trade immediately if it brought back a credible middle-six center, even one with a defensive focus.For Roslovic, the timing is becoming increasingly difficult. Sportsnet’s Elliotte Friedman noted earlier this month that at least five teams had legitimate interest, but the market has since tightened. With training camps approaching, most unsigned players are limited to one-year contracts or professional tryout (PTO) opportunities.Originally projected by AFP Analytics to land a three-year deal worth over $4 million annually, Roslovic may now be forced to accept another short-term pact closer to his last year’s value of $2.8 million. At 28 years old, he still brings top-nine upside, speed, and offensive consistency, but teams are reluctant to commit long-term this late in the offseason.While Jack Roslovic remains one of the most intriguing names available in free agency, the Vancouver Canucks are no longer a likely destination. With their attention turning to the trade market for center depth, Roslovic’s options are narrowing. Unless a team steps forward with a multi-year offer, the skilled forward may once again need to prove his value on a short-term deal.Also Read: Carolina Hurricanes bring back Jesper Fast in development role post-retirement","Nhl free agent jack roslovic is one of the top unsigned players on the market.

"India to ease China business visa process: Top executives' applications from Vivo, Xiaomi and more likely to be approved; move amid improving ties",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-to-ease-china-business-visa-process-top-executives-applications-from-vivo-xiaomi-and-more-likely-to-be-approved-move-amid-improving-ties/articleshow/123421524.cms,"India-China relations seem to be improving (AI image)

India could ease visa restrictions for Chinese business professionals, signalling improved bilateral relations. This will enable executives from companies like Vivo, Oppo, Xiaomi, Byd, Hisense and Haier to enter India after a nearly five-year hiatus, according to government and industry officials, quote by Economic Times.The officials indicated that most non-technical Chinese visa applications for senior positions will be approved. ""We have been informed to submit visa applications for business roles,"" said a senior executive from a prominent Chinese electronic company, who wished to remain anonymous.""This is a welcome relief as the business decisions were getting delayed. We had to travel to China or nearby countries like Singapore, Hong Kong, Thailand, or Malaysia for business meets,"" he added.India has restricted visas to Chinese nationals in technical roles, primarily favouring companies participating in production-linked incentive (PLI) schemes, for approximately the past year.The visa restrictions were implemented following the 2020 border incident. India also strengthened investment regulations for Chinese businesses through mandatory multi-ministry approval under Press Note 3 guidelines.Bilateral relations between the two nations have improved recently with reciprocal visits by ministers and officials, further enhanced by US President Donald Trump's tariff policies.Both countries have agreed to resume direct flights, permit tourism, and increase discussions to address border issues.Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to visit Tianjin this month, his first trip to China in seven years, to meet President Xi Jinping during the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation's summit.The relaxation of visa regulations aims to support Chinese companies operating in India and those forming partnerships with Indian enterprises. Industry officials indicated that most business visa applications are expected to receive approval through standard procedures.A Xiaomi India spokesperson responded positively saying, ""Our global leadership and key executives are eager to visit India again, should such changes be introduced, to continue deepening our engagement and understanding of the market.""Senior executives of Chinese firms, including Vivo India's Jerome Chen, Oppo India's Figo Zhang, and Realme India's Michael Guo, have been managing operations remotely from China. The visa situation has also affected US-China venture Carrier Midea, which has sought approval for a Chinese deputy managing director for three years.Byd India, a Chinese electric vehicle manufacturer, reported last year that it requested government clearances for two Chinese board members' visas, necessary for Companies Act compliance requiring one director's 182-day annual residence in India. No subsequent regulatory updates have been filed.Visa limitations and regulatory oversight have led Chinese companies to incorporate more Indian professionals into their boards.Senior staff from Indian manufacturers like Dixon Technologies, PG Electroplast, Epack Durable, Bhagwati Products and Amber Enterprises have frequently visited China for technical partnerships, given the absence of Chinese business visas.China remains India's primary source for electronic and automotive components, supplying 50-65% of electronic industry components. Indian manufacturing facilities rely heavily on Chinese partnerships.During Wang Yi's recent India visit, both nations agreed to enhance trade and investment through specific measures, including plans to encourage Chinese-Indian joint ventures in non-sensitive sectors.","India could ease visa restrictions for chinese business professionals. This will enable executives from companies like vivo, oppo, xiaomi, byd, hisense and haier to enter india after a nearly five-year hiatus. India has restricted visas to chinese nationals in technical roles.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123422073,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1271646,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
A German town's bid to break China's grip on rare earths,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/a-german-towns-bid-to-break-chinas-grip-on-rare-earths/articleshow/123421532.cms,"Representative image

Struggling despite strategic potential



The holy grail of the high-tech economy

A cleaner shortcut



No silver bullet







With its orchards of low-growing fruit trees and a harbor dotted with yachts, Bitterfeld has an air of pastoral charm. But this former East German town, about 140 kilometers (86 miles) southwest of Berlin, also has a less bucolic side.A shallow lake called the Silbersee is a reminder of a disused lignite mine that once provided fuel, while a tangle of pipes from one of Germany's oldest chemical facilities has long added an industrial twist to the skyline.Recently, this town of two tales has taken on a third persona, quietly emerging as a hub for the EU's drive to source rare earths on home turf.Vital to the manufacture of permanent magnets that show up in consumer electronics, renewables, and defense technologies, these chemical elements are largely sourced in China. As a result, Europe is dependent on exports — something it would like to change. Enter Bitterfeld.The idea is to recycle rare earth elements from end-of-life electronic devices. In May 2024, the family-run German tech group Heraeus opened its facility, a grey rectangular building shielded by a high barbed-wire fence, for that purpose.At its launch, the site was presented as ""the largest rare earth magnet recycling plant in Europe.""Initially, it aimed to produce around 600 tons of rare earth magnetic powder per year, with plans to double this figure to 1,200 tons in the near future. But that's not quite how things have panned out.A year after the launch, Heraeus says the facility is struggling to break even, despite the field's potential strategic importance.""I cannot disclose the exact number, but we are nowhere near full capacity,"" David Christian Bender, co-head of Heraeus Remloy, told DW, adding that European recycling ""cannot compete"" with rare earth metal deliveries from China.Four industrial sectors in Germany are particularly dependent on rare earth imports: the automotive industry, mechanical and plant engineering, energy, and defense. One of the key minerals they need is neodymium.Found in countless smart devices, from electric motors and wind turbines to MRI scanners and smartphone speakers, this silvery-white metal is the holy grail of the high-tech economy. The element, primarily in the form of neodymium-iron-boron magnets, is also crucial for military applications.""These magnets are used in precision-guided weapons, radar and sonar systems, satellite communications, and the acoustic signature reduction on military vehicles,"" Stefan Steinicke from the Federation of German Industries (BDI) told DW.Although Europe possesses some reserves, it does not currently mine neodymium. In fact, the continent imports 100% of its heavy rare earth elements (REEs), such as terbium, and 85% of its light rare earth elements, including neodymium, from China. The country also produces 90% of the world's magnets.""When it comes to electric motors, robotics and drones, import dependency is not only high, but system-critical,"" Steinicke said.Short-term import stoppages lead to production delays, supply bottlenecks, and price hikes. Longer-term disruptions could result in project cancellations in key tech sectors and cause strategic uncertainty among investors.In April this year, China severely restrictedits exports of several heavy rare earth metals and rare earth magnets, leading to a drastic shortfall in Europe. In some parts of Germany, production lines came to a standstill.In 2024, the EU introduced its Critical Raw Materials Act. By 2030, Europe aims to mine at least 10% of the raw materials it requires, process 40%, and recycle 25%. Dependence on any single non-EU country is to be reduced to a maximum of 65%.Experts welcome the targets but regard them as ambitious, saying the EU needs to move faster, make greater investments and be more creative with its policy tools.The mining-to-magnet production chain is long and costly. ""A green mine is an oxymoron. It always involves environmental degradation and pollution,"" said Pascal Leroy, Director General of the WEEE Forum, a Brussels-based non-profit focused on electronic waste.Short-loop recycling, in turn, uses vacuum melting, skipping the dirtiest, most energy-hungry steps found in the longer recycling loop. It is, therefore, held up as a cleaner alternative to mining.Aside from Heraeus Remloy, several other European companies are racing to lead in REE-recycling. But finding customers willing to pay extra to support European producers remains difficult.Jan Giese, a senior manager at TRADIUM, a German metal products distributor says the challenges are due to ""relatively high prices for interesting scrap material,"" higher European production costs, ""lower recycling capacities and resulting poorer economies of scale.""According to TRADIUM, the price of neodymium oxide has been gradually declining, albeit with certain volatility, since March 2022, reaching one of its low points around mid-2024. This further adds to recyclers' profitability struggles.So far, less than 1% of the rare earths consumed in the EU are recycled, Rüya Perincek, press officer at the EU Commission, told DW. And though Brussels has approved several projects to help tap private funding, it is not likely to tip the scales in any big way.Early next year, the EU is planning to launch a special platform connecting buyers and suppliers of strategic raw materials to diversify sourcing.""Recycling quotas could be part of a solution,"" Jürgen Hardt, foreign policy spokesman for Germany's conservative CDU/CSU parliamentary bloc, told DW.Highlighting the need for ""a coherent political effort that combines a mosaic of measures,"" he did not rule out a tax credit for magnets manufactured domestically or made from reclaimed components. Such steps, however, should be taken ""in close coordination within the EU,"" he added.Nearly 50% of all e-waste in the European Union remains uncollected, and less than 40% is recycled. The Commission plans to revise the WEEE Directive, an EU regulation on electronic waste management, to better align collection, treatment, and market incentives.According to Leroy, Brussels needs to introduce dedicated waste codes for permanent magnets so they can be traced and recycled before going missing or being exported.Together with its partners, the WEEE Forum has also created an online Urban Mine Platform highlighting the volume of precious materials in EU waste — equivalent to roughly the weight of three million African elephants.Bender, co-head of Heraeus Remloy, hopes to see a swift introduction of measures to boost the recycling of rare earth elements. He is calling for mandatory quotas and financial or tax incentives for using recycled European magnets, especially in the car industry.""The situation is very challenging... If nothing is done right now, I can't see any change happening by 2030,"" he added — despite the goals set in Brussels.","Europe imports 100% of its heavy rare earth elements (rees), such as terbium, from china. The continent imports 85% of the light rare earth elements, including neodymium. In may 2024, german tech group heraeus opened its facility, a grey rectangular building shielded by a high barbed-wire fence, for that purpose.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123421570,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-953135,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Britain agrees to drop mandate for Apple to provide 'back door',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/britain-agrees-to-drop-mandate-for-apple-to-provide-back-door/articleshow/123395824.cms,"Representative Image





SAN FRANCISCO: The Trump administration has reached an agreement with Britain to spare Apple from a request that the company create a tool to give British law enforcement organisations access to customers' cloud data.Tulsi Gabbard, US director of national intelligence, said Monday night that Britain had ""agreed to drop its mandate for Apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of American citizens and encroached on our civil liberties.""Britain's decision to back off the policy comes after Apple spent months lobbying officials in Washington and rolled back an encrypted storage feature for British users. In the face of govt pressure around the world, the company has been resolute that it won't create a back door that allows access to phones or encrypted user data because it is afraid such a tool could be abused.Much of Apple's predicament in Britain played out in private after the govt issued a secret order this year. The request came after Britain amended its Investigatory Powers Act of 2016, which allows it to compel companies to turn over data and communications to law enforcement and intelligence agencies.Apple helped make the secret order public by declaring in Feb that iPhone users in Britain would begin seeing messages on their phones saying the company no longer offered its Advanced Data Protection feature. The capability, which remained available in the US, had allowed British users to encrypt almost all of their iCloud data, including messages,notes, photos and backups.Gabbard said Britain's agreement would ""ensure Americans' private data remains private and our Constitutional rights and civil liberties are protected."" nyt",Britain drops mandate for apple to provide a 'back door' that would have enabled access to the protected encrypted data of american citizens.
