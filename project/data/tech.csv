Going off-patent

10.1cr Indians live with diabetes, most end up paying out of pocket

NEW DELHI: Several domestic drug companies are set to transform diabetes therapy by launching the blockbuster drug Empagliflozin at a fraction of the innovator’s price.Affordable generics will hit the market within days, following the expiry of Boehringer Ingelheim’s patent on Empagliflozin on March 11, industry sources told TOI.The launch of generic Empagliflozin , used to treat diabetes, related comorbidities, including heart failure, promises to slash therapy costs, making it more accessible to millions of diabetics and easing the financial strain of this debilitating disease. Those looking to launch the drug include Mankind Pharma , Torrent, Alkem, Dr Reddy’s and Lupin.Mankind Pharma, India’s fourth-largest firm by market share, plans to offer Empagliflozin at one-tenth the innovator’s Rs 60 per tablet, sources said.Most generic versions will cost Rs 9-14 per tablet, disrupting the high-growth diabetes therapy market valued at nearly Rs 20,000 crore, up 43% from Rs 14,000 crore in 2021.The market was further bolstered by Torrent Pharmaceuticals’ acquisition of three Empagliflozin brands from Boehringer Ingelheim last year. With India facing a staggering public health burden—10.1 crore people live with diabetes, according to International Diabetes Federation— this shift is critical.“This aligns with our philosophy of breaking cost barriers with a high-quality product (raw materials certified by regulators like the USFDA) at an affordable price. Using our own active pharmaceutical ingredient in bulk lowers costs, and we will deploy separate teams to promote two distinct brands, boosting distribution and market share,” said a Mankind Pharma executive.The market size of Empagliflozin and its combinations is estimated at Rs 640 crore. Experts highlight its ability to significantly reduce heart failure hospitalisations, slow chronic kidney disease progression and improve survival in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, though high pricing has long limited access.Metformin remains the first-line treatment for type-2 diabetes, but as the disease progresses, additional medications—such as Sulfonylureas (glimepiride, glyburide, glipizide, chlorpropamide), DPP-4 Inhibitors (sitagliptin, vildagliptin), and SGLT2 Inhibitors (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin)—are added. Now, newer therapies like semaglutide and tirzepatide enhance management, offering improved glycemic control and cardiovascular benefits.The economic burden of diabetes weighs heavily in India, where most patients pay out-of-pocket due to limited medical reimbursement. Treatment costs escalate with complications, magnifying the challenge.","Affordable generics will hit the market within days, following the expiry of boehringer ingelheim’s patent on empagliflozin.

"Solar ingot, wafer units seek duty safeguard against Chinese dumping",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/solar-ingot-wafer-units-seek-duty-safeguard-against-chinese-dumping/articleshow/118826195.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: Amid US president Donald Trump’s tariff war against Beijing, the call for duty protection against Chinese dumping is getting louder from domestic producers of polysilicon , ingot and wafers — making up the solar industry ’s upstream segment that provides the building blocks for solar cells and panels.At a meeting with renewable energy ministry officials on March 1, industry representatives pressed for safeguard duty (SGD) on Chinese supplies of these basic inputs, pointing out how such a levy and other incentives had helped India become self-sufficient in module and panel manufacturing.A presentation made by the Indian Solar Manufaturers Association underlined the urgency of steps to boost upstream manufacturing as Chinese dumping could undercut investments being made to expand capacity in line with the government’s solar ambitions. China customs data pegs wafer exports alone to India at $318 million in 2023, marking a surge of 91% over the previous year.Cells and modules from China, Taiwan and Malaysia currently attract 20% SGD, which was first imposed at 25% in July 2018. In July 2019, it was reduced to 20% and further to 15% from January 2020 to July 2020, only to be reinstated at 20% in July 2024.The upstream players also sought protection similar to ALMMS (approved list of models and manufacturers) scheme for cell and module manufacturers mandating locally produced panels in public projects but left polysilicon, ingot and wafer makers at the mercy of Chinese imports.The presentation called for reorientation of government focus towards the capital and energy intensive upstream manufacturing with Import duty exemption on capital goods and raw material for producing polysilicon, ingot and wafers.The wishlist for fiscal incentives included a fresh capital subsidy programme, priority lending and interest subvention and creation of dedicated funds. In addition, other accelerated depreciation on plant and machinery was also suggested.","The call for duty protection against chinese dumping is getting louder from domestic producers of polysilicon, ingot and wafers.

NEW DELHI: India on Friday inked a $248 million contract with Russia’s state-owned Rosoboronexport (RoE) for procurement of 1,000 HP (horsepower) engines for its fleet of T-72 Tanks in “fully formed, completely knocked down and semi knocked down” conditions.“The deal also includes transfer of technology (ToT) from M/s RoE to M/s Armoured Vehicles Nigam Limited (or the Heavy Vehicles Factory) at Avadi, Chennai, for integration and subsequent licensed production of engines to boost the `Make in India' initiative,” a defence ministry official said.“The Russian-origin T-72s are the mainstay of the Army tank fleet, which at present are fitted with a 780 HP engine. Equipping the fleet of T-72 Tanks with 1,000 HP engines will enhance the battlefield mobility and offensive capability of the Army,” he added.Along with a fleet of 2,400 T-72 tanks, the Army has so far inducted 1,300 T-90S `Bhishma’ tanks of the 1,657 being produced by the Heavy Vehicles Factory under licence from Russia.The Army force is now also inducting 118 indigenous Arjun Mark-1A tanks , with 14 major and 57 minor “upgrades” to enhance firepower, mobility, endurance and protection, ordered for Rs 7,523 crore in Sept 2021. These 118 `improved’ tanks will add to the first 124 Arjun tanks inducted well over a decade ago.Then, there are the 354 indigenous light tanks for high-altitude warfare to be inducted under Project Zorawar for around Rs 17,500 crore. The need for such tanks, each weighing less than 25 tonnes with a high power-to-weight ratio as well as superior firepower and protection, has been driven home by the continuing almost four-year-long military confrontation with China in eastern Ladakh.","India inked a $248 million contract with russia’s state-owned rosoboronexport (roe) for procurement of 1,000 hp (horsepower) engines for its fleet of t-72 tanks.

Kylie Kelce , wife of former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce , has been making waves with her popular podcast Not Gonna Lie with Kylie Kelce, where she openly shares her experiences as a mother. With three daughters—Wyatt, Ellie, and Bennett—already part of the Kelce household and a fourth child on the way, Kylie has implemented a strict rule when it comes to technology: her children are not allowed to use or own phones.In the latest episode of her podcast, Kylie Kelce explained how she ensures her children grow up with a balanced approach to technology. While she does allow them to watch shows on tablets, smartphones are completely off-limits.“They are not allowed to touch phones,” Kylie stated. “That has been a rule from the very beginning. Occasionally, they will borrow someone’s phone and take pictures. Wyatt is really into taking selfies right now. Dad’s really thrilled about that one.”The Kelce household operates with a structured approach to screen time. Kylie admitted that while her daughters do watch content on tablets, she cleverly manages their usage. “I will pretend that I set a timer and I will tell them, ‘One more,’” she shared. “If my task that I was trying to complete is not finished, I will say, ‘You guys were so well behaved, I’ll let you watch one more.’”This strategy allows her to control their exposure while ensuring they remain engaged in other aspects of childhood beyond screens.Kylie has never shied away from discussing the real challenges of motherhood. On the January 23rd episode of her podcast, she described raising children as the “most selfless” and “all-encompassing” thing a person can do.""At any point in the day, you do have to always be concerned about the tiny humans you're responsible for, but I think there is a misconception that it wipes out the rest of you and makes you solely mom,"" Kylie explained.She further emphasized the importance of maintaining individuality while embracing motherhood. ""Whereas what we need to do is tack it on to the end of the resume and keep the rest of the s--- that also defines us as who we are as people because we're still us,"" she continued. ""Just because we made a human being or we are a mother to a tiny human doesn't mean that we are only mom.""Kylie Kelce’s Not Gonna Lie podcast has rapidly grown in popularity, reaching No. 1 on some platforms and amassing over 290,000 YouTube subscribers. Many of her episodes garner six-digit viewership, solidifying her presence in media.Meanwhile, Jason Kelce has also built a successful career post-football, co-hosting the New Heights podcast with his brother, Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce , as well as contributing to ESPN and other NFL coverage.Also Read: Caitlin Clark confidently names her all-time favorite NFL player – No second thoughts needed With their fourth child on the way, the Kelce household is about to get even busier.

Chromecast 2nd Gen outage: The error message

Users of Google's second-generation Chromecast and Chromecast Audio devices are experiencing significant issues due to an authentication error, preventing them from casting content from their smartphones or tablets. As reported by 9to5Google, users from around the globe are experiencing issues with the devices.The issue first gained traction on the r/googlehome subreddit, where multiple users shared their experiences of being unable to connect to their Chromecast (2nd Gen). Users have attempted common troubleshooting methods, such as restarting, factory resetting, reinstalling the Google Home app, clearing cache/data, and even trying different networks, but none of these steps appear to resolve the issue.Some users have encountered an error message that reads: “Untrusted device: [name] couldn’t be verified. This could be caused by outdated device firmware.” This message effectively locks users out of casting capabilities, as it only provides an option to close the dialog box.Interestingly, the problem seems to only affect older Chromecast models, specifically the 2nd generation Chromecast and Chromecast Audio. Newer models, like the Chromecast (3rd gen) and Chromecast Ultra, are reportedly functioning without any issues.Many users are concerned that Google may have quietly discontinued support for these older Chromecast models, effectively rendering them unusable overnight. Given Google's history of sunsetting products without much warning, this concern isn’t entirely unwarranted. However, the nature of the error message suggests that this might be more of a software bug than an intentional shutdown.As users await further information, the uncertainty looms over whether a fix will be implemented soon.","Users of google's second-generation chromecast and chromecast audio devices are experiencing significant issues due to an authentication error.

Croatia is trying a Roman emperor’s price cap to tame inflation. Will it work?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/croatia-is-trying-a-roman-emperors-price-cap-to-tame-inflation-will-it-work/articleshow/118827556.cms,"File photo

SPLIT (CROATIA): In AD 301, Emperor Diocletian made a bold but ultimately unsuccessful bid to address the inflation that was rampaging across the eastern half of the divided Roman Empire. Prices of everything from purple thread and feathers to cattle were dictated by his Edict on Maximum Prices. Violators faced the death penalty. Diocletian gave up power about four years after issuing his edict, watching his measure fail from his sprawling retirement palace in the heart of what became the city of Split in Croatia.Now Croatia’s govt is trying a similar tactic to rein in prices, which have soared in recent years and have sparked protests and retail boycotts by the country’s beleaguered consumers. The govt introduced price controls for retailers last month, targeting supermarket items such as bread, pork and shampoo. The penalties are less drastic than those decreed by Diocletian, mandating a fine of up to €30,000, for retailers breaking the rules. It is unclear whether the new edict will be any more successful than Diocletian’s, which economists say ended up being counterproductive by causing shortages, fuelling a black market and enabling profiteers. For the moment, consumers are still figuring out how to navigate the new system, which caps the price of 70 common grocery store products.Anita Kargotic, 62, went shopping recently at a Spar supermarket, where two signs were posted outside listing the maximum prices allowed for a range of goods. She tied her American Akita, named Maja, to a post outside, and later emerged from the store with a haul of kaiser rolls, popcorn kernels, soy flakes and crackers. Most were store-brand gene rics, already less expensive than more recognisable labels.Flea collars and dry dog food? Those are necessities. Grapes? No, too expensive. Staples like rice and pasta? Pass. “Those prices have become completely unreasonable,” she said.The new rules are the govt’s third attempt at controlling prices by fiat since Sept 2022. The first two efforts were largely ineffective, with retailers simply refusing to stock most pricecontrolled goods. The govt says it is serious this time, and it has promised regular inspections and fines for violators.Under the new rules brought in by PM Andrej Plenkovic, shop entrances must display a list of all 70 items that fall under the govt’s pricing regulations. Centuries ago, Diocleti an’s edict accused some citizens of price gouging and said their greed needed to be reined in. In Jan, Plenkovic struck a similar tone. “We support companies that work well and make a profit, but within realistic frames. That can’t be at the expense of the little guy,” he said.Many people say price controls are not the answer. John H. Cochrane, an economist, pointed to the role Diocletian’s edict played in causing shortages and fuelling a black market. “It’s like trying to stem the symptoms rather than treating the underlying disease,” Cochrane said of price controls.","Croatia's govt introduced price controls for retailers last month, targeting supermarket items such as bread, pork and shampoo. The penalties are less drastic than those decreed by diocletian, mandating a fine of up to €30,000, for retailers breaking the rules.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118827579,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-445234,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

The collection also contained an intimate snapshot of Meghan and Harry sharing a joyful embrace on the beach.The caption read: Celebrating the strong women around us & the girls with dreams who will become women with vision. Also thanking those who uplift us every day.'Despite mixed reviews of her new Netflix programme With Love , Meghan appears enthusiastic, announcing its second season renewal through a celebratory Instagram dance. Industry sources suggest the surrounding controversy influenced the decision for renewal.Responding to recent criticism, she acknowledged her learning process, admitting she makes mistakes, but emphasised that she is ""learning every day"" following the widespread backlash to her highly anticipated Netflix show.She said: ""Right now! I’m launching my business, As Ever, which has been my heartsong for years. Every day I’m learning so much as a founder. I’m taking baby steps and big strides at the same time, making mistakes and learning from them, and really working to find all the joy while diving into the creative process and the business.""""Being in the granular parts of the business gives me the same feeling I have when I’m gardening: bare hands in the soil, planting a seed with so much care, and nurturing it as it grows.There’s something energizing about being in my 40s and turning my passion project into a business - and sharing that with the world,"" she added.Also read: Meghan Markle under fire after fans spot daughter Lilibet without safety gear in boat photo Meghan's show sees her welcoming famous friends to a California estate, where she shares tips on cooking, gardening, and hosting.However, critics have panned the series, dismissing it as “gormless lifestyle filler” with a “tangible desperation.” Some reviewers claim the Duchess is “trying to cling to fame by any means possible,” while another described a scene where she “joylessly fills kids’ party bags with seeds.”Similarly, Kate Middleton marked International Women’s Day with a heartfelt tribute, sharing a series of posts dedicated to women who have inspired her over the past year.""Celebrating #InternationalWomensDay!

Nasa has postponed the launch of two major space missions, SPHEREx and PUNCH, which were set to lift off aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket on Saturday night from California.“The additional time will allow teams to continue rocket checkouts ahead of liftoff,” according to an update shared by Nasa. “A new launch date will be announced once confirmed on the range,” it said.SPHEREx will scan the entire sky in infrared light, uncovering secrets about galaxies and cosmic history, while PUNCH will study the sun's outer atmosphere and solar wind.SPHEREx, short for Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer, is a space telescope that will survey the entire sky in 102 colours of infrared light. It will capture about 600 images per day, studying millions of stars and galaxies. Scientists will use the data to track how galaxies have evolved over time, identify frozen water and other essential elements across the Milky Way, and create a three-dimensional map of galaxies to help researchers understand cosmic inflation after the Big Bang.PUNCH, or Polarimeter to Unify the Corona and Heliosphere, is a set of four suitcase-sized satellites designed to study the sun’s outer atmosphere, known as the corona, and the solar wind. One satellite will take detailed images of the sun’s corona, while the other three will track solar wind and coronal mass ejections—massive solar eruptions that can impact Earth’s power grids and satellites. By analysing polarised light, PUNCH will map the movement of solar particles and help improve space weather predictions.","Nasa has postponed the launch of two major space missions.

Detective Melissa Mercado , a seven-year New York Police Department veteran, has been removed from active investigations in the Special Victims Division after she featured in a rap video that went viral. Her participation in the video, which some critics say is degrading to women, has sparked controversy within the department.Mercado’s involvement in the “Doin that” music video by rapper S-Quire is now under review, according to an NYPD spokeswoman, reported New York Post. While the department has not confirmed if she broke any specific rules, her appearance in the video has raised concerns about professionalism and the image of law enforcement.According to Pitch Perfect, the director of the video, Mercado was hired through a casting agency, and neither he nor the rapper knew she was a detective. “None of us were aware of her main profession,” he told TMZ.Mercado, who earns $144,000 a year as a third-grade detective, was not identified as an NYPD officer in the video. She did not wear anything that linked her to the department. However, some within law enforcement found her involvement inappropriate, given her role in investigating sex crimes.Retired officer and lawyer Eric Sanders said Mercado’s participation in the video goes against the values of policing. “She should be disciplined,” he stated. “Police work is a noble profession, and it’s supposed to look a certain way.”Despite the backlash, Pitch Perfect claims she has received multiple offers to feature in other rap videos since her debut in S-Quire’s song. “I’ve had tons of artists reach out trying to get her in their video,” Pitch Perfect added, laughing, “If you look at it like that, it might be a great thing for her. I think she wins.”By Saturday, the “Doin that” video had racked up over 1.6 million views on WorldStarHipHop.","Detective melissa mercado has been removed from active investigations in the special victims division after she featured in a rap video that went viral.

Nigeria seeks to cash in on soaring cocoa prices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/nigeria-seeks-to-cash-in-on-soaring-cocoa-prices/articleshow/118813434.cms,"Representative image

'Full-sun' monocrop

Land and money?

ABUJA: Booming cocoa prices are stirring interest in turning Nigeria into a bigger player in the sector, with hopes of challenging top producers Ivory Coast and Ghana, where crops have been ravaged by climate change and disease.Nigeria has struggled to diversify its oil-dependent economy but investors have taken another look at cocoa beans after global prices soared to a record $12,000 per tonne in December.""The farmers have never had it so good,"" Patrick Adebola, executive director at the Cocoa Research Institute of Nigeria, told AFP.More than a dozen local firms have expressed interest in investing in or expanding their production this year, while the British government's development finance arm recently poured $40.5 million into Nigerian agribusiness company Johnvents.Nigeria is the world's seventh biggest cocoa bean producer, producing more than 280,000 tonnes in 2023, according to the most recent data compiled by the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization.The government has set an ambitious production target of 500,000 tonnes for the 2024-2025 season, which would move it into fourth place behind Ivory Coast, Ghana and Indonesia.Adebola doubts Nigeria can reach the target this season, but he believes it is feasible in the next few years as there is rising interest in rehabilitating old plantations or establishing new ones.He said Nigerian growers are much more exposed to the highs and lows of the global cocoa market than their peers in Ivory Coast and Ghana as prices are regulated in those countries.Cocoa futures contracts in New York have fallen from their December record but they remain high at more than $8,000 per tonne. Cocoa prices typically ranged between $2,000 and $3,000 before the recent surge.""Individuals are going into cocoa production at every level... to make sure they also enjoy the current price,"" said Comrade Adeola Adegoke, president of the Cocoa Farmers Association of Nigeria.Ivory Coast is by far the world's top grower, producing more than two million tonnes of cocoa beans in 2023, followed by Ghana at 650,000 tonnes.But the two countries had poor harvests last year as crops were hit by bad weather and disease, causing a supply shortage that sent global prices to all-time highs.Nigeria's cocoa has largely been spared so far from the worst effects of climate change, but expanding the crop could carry environmental risks.The government has stepped up efforts to promote the long-unregulated sector via the National Cocoa Management Committee, which was established in 2022 to regulate the industry and support farmers.But agriculture modernisation efforts have encouraged the development of ""full-sun"" monocrop plantations that only focus on growing cocoa beans, without the use of companion plants or trees.A recent study in the journal Agroforestry Systems has raised concerns about this approach, saying monocrop farming can be less sustainable compared growing the bean alongside shade trees, promoting biodiversity and improving environmental health.Scaling up the sector could also prove challenging because much of Nigeria's cocoa is grown by small-scale farmers.Peter Okunde, a farmer in Ogun state, told AFP he lacks both the capital and land to expand his four-hectare (10-acre) cocoa plantation.Land ""is the major instrument farmers need... and the money to develop it"", said Okunde, 49.But John Alamu, group managing director of Johnvents, told CNBC Africa this week that ""the problem is not land area"".Noting that Nigeria has 1.4 million hectares dedicated to cocoa production -- more than Ghana's 1.1 million, he told the broadcaster a more holistic approach was needed.""These are things (other) governments have used to support farmers: provision of seedlings, training on good agronomic practices, a real focus on sustainable agriculture,"" he said.""These are key things that will be responsible to take Nigeria back to its leadership position.""","Nigeria has struggled to diversify its oil-dependent economy.

Elon Musk questioned by Tesla shareholders as stock declines for sixth consecutive session: “share five things you did for Tesla shareholders this week…”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/share-five-things-you-did-for-tesla-shareholders-this-week-elon-musk-questioned-by-tesla-shareholders-as-stock-declines-for-sixth-consecutive-session/articleshow/118688836.cms,"Elon Musk called out by investors as Tesla’s stock struggles continue

“Please share five things you did for Tesla shareholders this week. Or are you working remotely? Asking for all of us.”

Tesla stock performance and financial concerns

Increased competition in the EV market from legacy automakers such as Ford, GM, and global competitors like BYD.

Production and delivery challenges, with supply chain disruptions affecting Tesla’s output.

Leadership distractions, as Musk continues to divide his attention across multiple ventures, raising concerns about Tesla’s long-term strategic direction.

Regulatory scrutiny over Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology and ongoing legal challenges related to product safety.

Elon Musk’s expanding commitments raise concerns

Tesla investors have expressed growing frustration as the company’s stock continues to decline, marking its sixth consecutive session of losses. Shareholders are increasingly holding CEO Elon Musk accountable, questioning his recent actions and decision-making. The backlash follows Elon Musk’s controversial demand for U.S. federal employees to justify their salaries by listing five accomplishments each week—a strategy he previously implemented at Twitter. Now, investors are turning the tables, demanding to know what Musk has done for Tesla shareholders as the stock tumbles.The discontent highlights broader concerns over Musk’s leadership, particularly his divided focus across multiple ventures, including SpaceX, Neuralink, The Boring Company, and his latest role as the U.S. government’s ""efficiency czar."" The ongoing criticism has sparked debates about his commitment to Tesla, a company once celebrated as the frontrunner in the electric vehicle (EV) industry.Amid Tesla’s stock decline, shareholders have taken to Musk’s own social media platform, X (formerly Twitter), to air their grievances. Celebrity photographer Jerry Avenaim was among those calling out Musk, posting:Accompanying the post was a stock performance graph showing Tesla’s downward trend. The sarcastic remark directly referenced Musk’s demand that federal employees justify their roles with weekly accomplishment lists, which had drawn criticism from government workers.Tesla investors are now challenging Musk using his own words, asking him to justify his leadership as stockholders witness losses. The growing unrest among investors signals a shift in sentiment, as many once ardent supporters now express skepticism over Musk’s priorities and Tesla’s future.Tesla’s stock has faced significant volatility since the start of 2025, with sharp declines raising concerns among investors. While Musk remains a visionary figure in the tech and automotive industries, recent market performance suggests that investor confidence may be wavering.Several factors have contributed to Tesla’s stock drop, including:Market analysts have warned that Tesla’s declining stock could further erode investor confidence unless Musk reaffirms his commitment to the company’s growth and stability.One of the key points of contention among shareholders is Musk’s involvement in multiple ventures beyond Tesla. His leadership roles at SpaceX, Neuralink, The Boring Company, and X have raised questions about whether he is stretched too thin.Additionally, Musk’s new role as the U.S. government’s ""efficiency czar"" has sparked debate. Appointed under Donald Trump’s administration, Musk has been tasked with improving governmental operations. However, critics argue that this political involvement further diverts his focus from Tesla at a critical time.Musk’s controversial management style has also drawn criticism. His push for extreme work culture at Twitter, mass layoffs, and controversial statements on social media have led some investors to question whether similar turbulence could impact Tesla’s stability.","Elon musk called out by investors as tesla’s stock struggles continue to decline.

Infosys has implemented a new attendance system via a mobile application that mandates employees to be physically present at their designated office locations for at least 10 days monthly. The system will not automatically approve work-from-home requests, according to a senior staff member who requested not to be named.A colleague mentioned this requirement is primarily driven by project needs rather than departmental demands.Department heads at the Bengaluru-based organisation sent emails to their team members, instructing them to restrict their work-from-home requests starting March 10, according to sources who spoke to ET.Also Read | How will Elon Musk-led DOGE’s slashing of federal spending impact Indian IT companies?

Shift Mindset, Revive Animal Spirits, Every Challenge Is An Opportunity, Ministers Tell India Inc At ET Awards

Categories and winners

As nations fret over the economic fallout of Donald Trump’s tariff tactics, India’s policymakers urged business leaders to seize the moment, promising “ten steps of support for every one taken”, putting national interests forward.“Every challenge — whether it’s geo-economic fragmentation, tariff wars, deflationary trends, or declining global demand — presents an opportunity. This mindset is something we draw from the Prime Minister, who often says that every challenge contains multiple opportunities,” said finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, in a fireside chat at the ET Awards on Saturday. She added that a Viksit Bharat would need enhanced trade and exports.She highlighted the shift from protection to pragmatism, stating, “We must guard against dumping, while ensuring that Indian manufacturers — especially small and medium enterprises — get access to affordable inputs. The key is to strike a balance: Allow cheaper inputs without becoming a victim of dumping.” She also comforted industry by promising a reduction in GST.Sitharaman’s colleague, railways, IT and I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said geopolitical shifts would ultimately strengthen India. Both ministers pushed to revive animal spirits, with Vaishnaw urging industry to invest in 25-30 key products. “If you take one step forward, govt is there to take 10 steps with you,” he said.Calling for a shift in mindset, Sitharaman asked industry leaders, “Are you living today, or are you living in the 60s and 70s?” She said that while some may doubt govt’s growth figures, global agencies affirm India is the fastest-growing economy, with every sector expanding. She added that just as sentiment drives markets, it shapes the economy, warning that “the youth will put us through the grind, if we continue with all the naysaying in spite of all the achievements”.Echoing her sentiments, Aditya Birla Group chairman Kumar Mangalam Birla, a third-time ET Award winner, said: “From the perspective of leading a conglomerate across 40 countries, I’d say there are two regions that we consider permanent bets: India and North America. India’s story remains strong. Many of the challenges we face are shared by other large economies, but the way to compete globally is by investing, not waiting.”The 25th ET Awards reflected India’s evolving journey — from 90s optimism to global ambitions, post-crisis resilience, start-up exuberance, and now a more mature phase — focusing less on numbers and more on national interest and doing good.Kumar Mangalam captured the essence, quoting his late great grandfather GD Birla, “How does one judge a company? Does the criteria depend solely on profitability, market share, and product ratings? Or, is there something deeper, more human? We believe what truly matters is how much the company cares, how socially involved it is, and how much it improves the quality of life for the people around it.”Noel Tata, chairman, Tata Trusts, known for his reserved public presence throughout his 40-year tenure with the Tata Group, made a rare public statement at the ET Awards, delivering a four minute speech about late Ratan Tata, while accepting the Jewel of India award.This marked his first public remarks on Ratan Tata after taking charge of Tata Trusts in Oct 2024 and his first joint public appearance with Tata Sons chairman N Chandrasekaran to pay tributes to Ratan Tata. Noel Tata said while Ratan Tata’s achievements in business made him famous, there was so much more to him. “His vision for Tata Trusts expanded its philanthropic efforts, and in his personal capacity, he was always willing to help those in need. Empathy came naturally to him, and this was evident in the many lives he touched.”Chandrasekaran chose not to dwell on numbers, while speaking about Ratan Tata. “Since this is an Eco nomic Times award, one might expect a speech about financial achievements — revenues, market capitalisation, profits. But knowing him closely, I can say those numbers never mattered to him as much,” said Chandrasekaran. The chief of Tata Group recounted an incident during 2017 renovation of iconic Bombay House, when Ratan Tata’s primary concern was where the dogs, sheltered there, would go.Often likened to the Oscars of business, the ET Awards took a more mature turn this year, highlighting the unseen side of businessmen—especially through the women in their lives—coinciding with International Women's Day.Vishakha Mulye, CEO of Aditya Birla Capital and winner of Businesswoman of the Year award, highlighted how the stars have to be fully aligned for one half of the country’s population to succeed. “There’s a famous saying that behind every successful man, there is a woman. But, for women to succeed, many things need to fall into place — from the families they are born into, families they marry into, institutions they work with, and ecosystems they operate in. I consider myself fortunate that all these factors aligned for me”. She spoke of how many women executives at ICICI were a source of support, while facing challenges in balancing personal life and career.Personal tributes replaced conventional introductions. Mallika Srinivasan, CEO of Tafe, reflected on her husband, Ve nu Srinivasan, chairman emeritus, TVS Motor. Ananya Birla, founder of Svatantra Microfin, spoke of her father, Kumar Mangalam Birla, whose delight at winning a third ET Award prompted the family to clear their schedules. Nidhi Bansal highlighted Lenskart co-founder Peyush Bansal’s commitment to family, teamwork, and social impact. Malika Noor Mehta, niece of Fareed Zakaria, offered a portrait of her uncle as a man of rare intellect and generosity, adept at distilling complexity into clarity.","The 25th et awards reflected india’s evolving journey — from 90s optimism to global ambitions, post-crisis resilience, start-up exuberance, and now a more mature phase.

BENGALURU: Women remain significantly under-represented in India's venture capital (VC) industry, especially in decision-making roles, despite growing conversations about diversity and inclusion. An analysis of the investment teams at India’s most active VC firms, in terms of volume across years 2023 to 2025 so far, reveals how stark the gender gap remains.Among the 20 most active VC investors that TOI analysed, several firms have no women at all in their investment teams, including Z47 , Stellaris Venture Partners, and Nexus Venture Partners. Peak XV Partners has the highest absolute number of women investors, with 13 out of 44, while firms such as Blume Ventures (6 out of 23) and Accel India (5 out of 25) have relatively better representation. However, firms like Lightspeed Ventures (4 out of 16) and Elevation Capital (7 out of 33) still reflect the broader industry-wide challenge — women are outnumbered at nearly every major firm.This lack of diversity in VC teams has consequences beyond representation. “Peer networks play a huge role in hiring and decision-making in VC,” said Ankita Vashistha, founder and managing partner at Arise Ventures. “Most senior hiring is based on referral. Investment committees and general partners are predominantly male, and unconscious biases can shape whom they hire and fund. This has a direct impact on the startup ecosystem, as male-dominated VC firms are often less likely to back women-led startups.”Kanika Mayar, partner at Vertex Ventures, echoed this sentiment. “The problem isn’t just at the top. We need more women entering the investment space at all levels, so there is a strong pipeline for leadership roles. Firms need to be intentional about hiring and retaining women in VC. It’s not just about numbers — it’s about building an ecosystem that actively supports diverse perspectives.""According to PitchBook, in the US, women made up 18.4% of investment decision-makers at VC firms in 2023. In Europe, the situation is starker, with only 16% of investment partners being women.","Several firms have no women at all in their investment teams.

NEW DELHI: Japanese Nippon Paint is counting on India’s “youth dividend” as the company – with a business of $400 million in the country – looks to make fresh investments and up the hiring to expand its local operations as well as broaden export commitments .“There's such a youth dividend in India. A lot of countries are ageing, but India is still young. India is urbanizing. India's GDP is growing. So, there's so much to speak for India. We are here for the last nearly 20 years, (and) I'm sure there's a lot of headroom for growth,” Wee Siew Kim, Co-President of Nippon Paint Holdings and Group CEO, NIPSEA Group, told TOI. “The short answer is we are very positive on India.”Nippon Paints, which started operations in India in 2006, currently has four business divisions -- auto refinish; decorative; industrial; and automotive paints (JV with Berger). “All of them are growing, but also have different sets of challenges, especially the decorative space.”The company locally produces paints for its various divisions, and much of them are also exported. “Coil coating is exported together with our auto refinish .”The auto refinish division, led by Sharad Malhotra, is led globally out of India. “Which means that all the auto refinish business reports to Malhotra and he sets the direction for the group globally. So, it is an Indian team which is leading the division worldwide.”Kim said the same situation is there in the coil coating division which is targeted at the steel industry. “This is also exported to different parts of the world. Importantly, just like in auto refinish, the leader who leads coil coating in India also leads the global business. Globally, auto refinish is around $250-$270 million business, while coil coating is slightly smaller at about $180 million. If you add Japan, it's almost a $300-$400 million business for us. They are run by Indian leaders. These leaders run them and set the direction, whether it is the strategic business direction or important technology directions or product innovations.”He said the company is looking at not just organic growth, but also through acquisitions and buyouts. “Organic growth is where we grow the people, we invest in factories, and develop and make the products. Then there's the M&A growth. In the last two years, we have been fairly successful in acquiring local Indian companies where we not only bring the strength of the bigger Nippon Paint group, but also harness the value of these relatively-smaller companies. One such company has actually helped us get into the railways segment in India.”Kim said the company may also look at acquisitions in the auto refinished business as the division looks at expanding beyond its stronghold in the north. “So, if we could find partners or acquisitions in other parts of India, it will help us strengthen our pan-India presence.”On whether the company will look at funding its growth in India by raising money through an IPO, he said, “Well, I would say ‘never say never’. The Indian market is actually attractive and has very rich multiples. If you look at what some of the Indian counters are trading at, I mean they are far ahead of even the world benchmarks as far as paints and coatings are concerned. … if you ask me that would I be interested to consider raising funds in India? Well, at the right multiples, it’s worth considering.”Kim said Nippon Paint Holdings is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. “As far as our global approach to growth is concerned, we have actually articulated an asset assembler strategy. The asset assembler strategy drives us to take advantage of the lower cost of funding in Japan and using that to actually breathe life into our mission. The mission is to actually maximise shareholder value.”","Japanese nippon paint is counting on india’s “youth dividend” as the company – with a business of $400 million in the country – looks to make fresh investments. “there's such a youth dividend in india.
