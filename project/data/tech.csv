Digital economy has eliminated traditional boundaries

Companies report positive results from flexible schedules

Shark Tank judge and millionaire Kevin O'Leary has dismissed the growing four-day workweek movement as ""the stupidest idea I have ever heard,"" arguing that the modern digital economy has already made traditional work schedules obsolete.Speaking on Fox News, the 70-year-old investor took particular aim at France's exploration of shortened work weeks, suggesting a provocative alternative: ""I think we should let the French go to a two-day workweek and then kick their ass internationally,"" he spoke at a Fox TV show.O'Leary contends that pandemic-era changes have fundamentally altered how work functions. ""There's no such thing as a workweek anymore anyway on a digital economy, post-pandemic,"" he explained. With 40% of his staff working remotely worldwide, he focuses on project completion rather than hours clocked.""I don't care when my staff does their work—as long as it gets done on time,"" O'Leary said, acknowledging that while he opposes mandated four-day weeks, the traditional 9-to-5 model is equally outdated.Despite O'Leary's skepticism, numerous organizations are seeing benefits from shortened workweeks. Performance coaching company Exos implemented a four-day schedule for its 3,500 employees, resulting in 24% increased productivity and halved burnout rates.The trend has gained executive attention, with 30% of CEOs now considering organization-wide schedule shifts, according to KPMG survey data. International governments are also experimenting—Tokyo's metropolitan government recently introduced four-day options to address population decline and improve work-life balance .""We must build a society where everyone can balance work and family life, and one step forward is the four-day workweek,"" Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike told Fortune.Research supports worker interest, with 77% of employees saying a four-day workweek would favorably impact their wellbeing, even if maintaining 40 total hours, according to Gallup polling.","Kevin o'leary: ""there's no such thing as a workweek anymore anyway on a digital economy, post-pandemic"" 30% of ceos now considering organization-wide schedule shifts, according to kpmg survey.

Rachel Gomber shows her sons enjoying sensory kits in a playful home moment

Rachel Gomber continues to charm with the family-first approach





When it comes to social media, nobody hits out a wholesome moment quite like Rachel Gomber, wife of Colorado Rockies pitcher Austin Gomber, who recently posted the cutest pic of family life. Rachel filmed a clip of their young sons having fun with sensory play kits and shared the footage on her Instagram Story. Under the caption, “The boys are OBSESSED with these sensory play kits,” the post soon garnered attention for its cute, pure nature.Rachel Gomber provided her followers with an up-close glimpse into her creative times with her two boys in an Instagram Story that made waves. In the clip, both kids wear matching retro Rockies jerseys — a nod to dad Austin Gomber's MLB team — as they play with sensory kits decorated with the theme on the counter.The sensory kits are designed to encourage imaginative play and promote the development of fine and gross motor skills in children. Kneading colourful dough to one side, and the other exploring a curated bin of small props and textures. Rachel is not alone in her boys' love of the activity, with parents across the country aww-ing over it as a fun, screen-free alternative.Austin Gomber has the season of the Colorado Rockies to think about, but Rachel Gomber has her success sharing down-to-earth family content that makes a huge number of people feel less alone.Rachel also does a good job of meeting the balance of being a mother and a public figure, and her social media presence brings a normalcy and refreshing perspective to the life of a pro athlete family.The rise of the Gombers away from the pitch has only just received a boost from this recent post. They follow along for the realness of these personal family moments — whether that's supporting Austin at the ballpark, or home watching the kids find their new interests.Also Read: “Not being worst team” – Kyle Freeland speaks out as Colorado Rockies face a brutal season in MLB history The Gombers show that sports families can remain humble, even under the public spotlight.

As everyone’s geared up for Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2025, excitement is building among tech geeks, developers, and iPhone users. Packed with promises to be one of the biggest WWDC conferences so far, Apple is expected to introduce the most awaited iOS 26 , the future mobile operating system for iPhones. According to reports by BGR, the keynote is speculated to highlight breakthrough developments that not only improves the user experience but will also be compatible with artificial intelligence, has fluidity between cross-devices, and has a more intelligent design philosophy.Even though Apple has not publicly announced all the features, the leaks and rumors within the industry indicate a bright outlook. With AI-driven health recommendations to live translation through AirPods, iOS 26 will embark on a new path in making the iPhone smarter, smarter, and more personal.Listed below are the rumoured iOS 26 features that could completely transform your iPhone.One of the largest issues with beta software over the past few years has been instability during initial releases. Apple is said to be focusing heavily on foundational performance boosts and more refined beta testing cycles with iOS 26. This translates to fewer bugs, improved resource efficiency, and a cleaner experience across models.iOS 26 is expected to bring a UI redesign inspired by visionOS, the operating system behind Apple's Vision Pro. The new design is speculated to come with translucent features, more simplified menus, and a less prominent interface.Over the years, the Camera app has become a bit troublesome with a lot of toggles and buried options. With iOS 26, Apple can finally simplify this interface, providing a more smooth and distraction-free shooting experience.Fitness and health have been at the heart of Apple's world, but iOS 26 might take it to the next level with the launch of an AI health coach. This would take user information from the Health app and Apple Watch and create personalized fitness and wellness advice.Battery life remains a priority for iPhone users. Apple can solve this with AI-driven battery optimisation, where the operating system learns user habits and optimizes background activity accordingly.Accessing public Wi-Fi, particularly captive networks that demand login screens, can become a chore. iOS 26 might bring a shared login feature that is synced across devices with the same Apple ID.Perhaps the most awaited feature is real-time translation support in AirPods, which would possibly be driven by Apple Intelligence (Apple's own AI suite).From an improved battery life to smarter health tracking and real-time translation, the upcoming iOS 26 features seem aimed at making the iPhone not just a device, but a more intuitive extension of daily life. Stay tuned for Apple’s keynote, where all eyes will be on how many of these speculations actually become reality.","Ios 26 is expected to bring a ui redesign inspired by visionos, the operating system behind apple's vision pro.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s success secret revealed by his biographer: He is powered by fear of failing and that’s why he never slows down,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huangs-success-secret-revealed-by-his-biographer-he-is-powered-by-fear-of-failing-and-thats-why-he-never-slows-down/articleshow/121675759.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s biographer reveals ‘his deep fear of failure’ fuels his focus in tech industry



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang thrives under pressure and views stress as key to success



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang’s leadership forged with challenges



Also Read |

Nvidia CEO and co-founder Jensen Huang leads one of the world’s most valuable tech companies, valued at around $3.4 trillion. However, it is not confidence but a deep fear of failure that fuels his relentless drive. Huang’s anxiety about potential setbacks and fierce competition motivates his intense work ethic and commitment to innovation. This constant pressure pushes him to stay focused and vigilant, ensuring Nvidia remains a leader in the tech industry. His story reveals a leadership style shaped by the delicate balance between remarkable success and the persistent fear that it could all collapse unexpectedly.Jensen Huang's tale defies the conventional leadership story of optimism and self-assurance. His experience illustrates how anxiety and fear, constructively controlled, can be tremendous drivers of innovation and success. Huang's single-minded drive to excellence, fueled by an abiding fear of failure, has enabled Nvidia to transform industries including graphics processing and artificial intelligence.This atypical leadership approach emphasises that vulnerability and emotional nuance can go hand in hand with monumental success in the technology space.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's biographer Stephen Witt, author of The Thinking Machine, who spent considerable time interviewing Huang and his staff, Huang's primary driver is fear, not optimism. Huang openly admits that he lives every day with the nagging fear that Nvidia might ""implode at any moment."" Rather than letting this fear consume him, he employs it as a mighty engine that keeps him on the ball, propelling the company forward with an acute sense of urgency.Witt characterizes Huang's drive as ""his fuel, his gasoline""; the nervous energy that drives him compulsively. This psychological pressure compels Huang to work all the harder and guarantees he never gets complacent, even when the firm is at the height of its success.In contrast to most CEOs who prize confidence and tranquility when the going is good, Huang is at ease with pressure and challenge. According to Witt, Huang gets anxious when everything is going well and that his tension keeps him on his toes anticipating the occurrence of any hurdle. Huang confesses to being a tough boss, and in his opinion, stress and hardship are preconditions for doing something remarkable.Huang has stated that success needs persistence, pressure, and overcoming adversity. His view is that success is not often the result of simple or linear routes but from consistent effort under difficult circumstances.Huang's path hasn't been without challenges. During a 2024 Stanford University speech, he revealed that Nvidia came within a hair's breadth of collapse a mere few years after it was founded in 1993. This near failure had a significant influence on his leadership philosophy.Huang emphasizes that having high expectations of life or business to be always perfect predisposes individuals to failure when things are sure to go awry. Rather, he opines that the ability to endure tough situations and setbacks is vital for long-term success. Such resilience has been a major pillar in Nvidia's culture and Huang's own leadership style.Stephen Witt further discloses that Huang is motivated to a large extent by guilt. Huang has a deep sense of responsibility towards his team, investors, and firm, and this sense of obligation compels him to work even more diligently. Witt clarifies that Huang's motivation is not mere ambition but also a combination of the fear of failure, paranoia among competitors, and the guilt of possibly disappointing others. This generates tremendous internal pressure that Huang leverages as an impetus to remain focused and drive Nvidia to its greatest heights.",N nvidia ceo jensen huang’s biographer reveals ‘his deep fear of failure’ fuels his focus in tech industry.

Los Angeles protests: Why are Waymo robotaxis being torched? At least five self-driving cars destroyed in riots,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/los-angeles-protests-why-are-waymo-robotaxis-being-torched-at-least-five-self-driving-cars-destroyed-in-riots/articleshow/121740221.cms,"(Photo: X)

Waymos caught in the chaos

Not just about immigration

Robotaxis: Vulnerable in unrest

Fire risks and health concerns





Several Waymo self-driving taxis were vandalised and set alight during tense protests in Los Angeles following a wave of immigration raids.While the demonstrations were not specifically aimed at Waymo, the Alphabet-owned robotaxis became targets amid growing anger towards law enforcement, surveillance, and perceived inequality driven by Big Tech.At least five Waymo vehicles, all Jaguar I-PACE electric SUVs, were destroyed during protests over the weekend. Thick plumes of smoke billowed over downtown LA after demonstrators smashed windows, spray-painted anti-ICE slogans, and set the driverless cars on fire. Some protesters reportedly threw electric scooters into the burning shells, while others ripped off car doors or used skateboards and improvised flamethrowers to damage the vehicles.The scenes unfolded on Los Angeles Street between Arcadia and Alameda around 5 pm on Sunday. According to CNN and the Los Angeles Times, the vehicles were found lined up and were soon overwhelmed by a crowd angry over the Trump administration’s decision to send in the National Guard, a move California governor Gavin Newsom opposed.Waymo insists the protests were not directly related to its operations. However, critics argue that the robotaxis represent more than just technology.They say the cars, equipped with dozens of cameras, function as roving surveillance devices and may pose a threat to protester anonymity.“Safety is our highest priority,” Waymo spokesperson Ethan Teicher said in a statement. “We removed vehicles from Downtown Los Angeles and will not be serving that specific area for the time being, out of an abundance of caution and with guidance from LAPD.”A spokesperson told USA Today that the company is still operational across most of Los Angeles but has paused services in certain areas where protests have intensified.Waymo’s driverless vehicles, unlike human-operated taxis, lack the ability to judge and flee dangerous situations. Their programmed behaviour makes them passive targets during public unrest. They do not attempt to evade crowds or protest zones. This vulnerability, combined with their high-tech appearance, has made them stand out.The company’s rapid expansion has also drawn criticism. In January, Waymo said it had completed 1.9 million miles in LA alone. While the cars are popular with many users, some residents feel they were never consulted about having driverless technology tested in their neighbourhoods.The destruction of electric vehicles raised significant safety issues. The Los Angeles Fire Department responded to the blazes, and the LAPD warned that burning lithium-ion batteries release toxic gases, such as hydrogen fluoride, which pose risks to both emergency responders and bystanders.Electric vehicle fires are harder to extinguish. Unlike petrol-fuelled cars, EV batteries do not need oxygen to burn. Firefighters instead have to cool the battery using large volumes of water, often through special nozzles that spray directly beneath the vehicle.","At least five waymo vehicles, all jaguar i-pace electric suvs, were destroyed during protests over the weekend.

LONDON: Market regulators from six countries are cracking down on the illegal promotion of financial products by influencers on social media, UK officials said Friday.Britain's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) said the action, which began on Monday, has resulted in three arrests in the UK and the authorisation of criminal proceedings against three individuals.The crackdown is being conducted jointly with regulators from Italy, Canada, Hong Kong, Australia, and the United Arab Emirates.Some 50 ""warning letters"" have been issued, which will result in more than 650 requests to remove content from social media platforms and more than 50 websites ""operated by unauthorised finfluencers"", the FCA said.It has also sent seven ""cease and desist"" letters and invited four so-called finfluencers for interviews.So-called finfluencers, or financial influencers, use their social media audiences to promote investment products, share advice, or offer their opinions on investments.Many act legitimately, but some ""tout products or services illegally and without authorisation through online videos and posts, where they use the pretence of a lavish lifestyle, often falsely, to promote success"", according to the FCA.These products can be risky, such as cryptocurrencies.""Our message to finfluencers is loud and clear,"" said Steve Smart, joint executive director of enforcement and market oversight at the FCA.""They must act responsibly and only promote financial products where they are authorised to do so -- or face the consequences.""The announcement came as a group of British MPs said it had sent a letter to Meta, owner of Facebook and Instagram, asking for information on its approach to financial influencers.The letter from parliament's Treasury Committee follows evidence from FCA officials that Meta took up to six weeks to remove harmful content, longer than other platforms.""There was an isolated incident in late 2024 which resulted in a delay in actioning a small number of reports from the FCA,"" Meta said in a statement Friday.""This was rectified and all other relevant reports made by the FCA have been promptly processed.""",Market regulators from six countries are cracking down on the illegal promotion of financial products by influencers on social media.

Global architecture and design firm Gensler has released its 2025 Global Workplace Survey, delivering an in-depth look at what office workers want, and aren't getting, in the United Arab Emirates. Marking its twentieth edition, the survey drew insights from more than 16,800 full-time office workers across 15 countries, including a focused sample from the UAE.The survey findings come at a crucial moment as the UAE pushes forward on national priorities such as the “We the UAE 2031” vision and the National Strategy for Wellbeing. With this momentum in mind, the report provides a practical roadmap for employers and developers aiming to build future-ready workspaces aligned with innovation, talent attraction, and sustainable growth.“The UAE has become a global benchmark for ambition and adaptability,” said Edith Eddy, Senior Interior Designer, Workplace, at Gensler Middle East.“In cities like Dubai and Abu Dhabi, we are witnessing rapid shifts in how people live and work, and the workplace must evolve accordingly. Our research reveals a clear gap between what employees need to thrive — flexibility, creativity, and connection, and what their current spaces provide.Bridging this gap will be essential for organisations aiming to attract talent, foster innovation, and design workplaces that truly support the future of work in the Emirates. ”Despite heavy post-pandemic investment in upgraded office spaces across the UAE, including new, in-demand office buildings in Dubai and Abu Dhabi, only 31% of UAE office workers strongly agree that their current workspace enables them to do their best work, according to Gensler. This places the UAE ahead of France and Japan, but behind the UK, India, and the United States in workplace satisfaction.Common pain points remain:Top improvement areas identified by employees include:A lot of noise is rated as the biggest concern voiced by UAE office staff about their workplacesOne of the report’s most striking insights is the shifting vision for what an ideal workplace looks like. Only 15% of UAE workers said their ideal workplace is a formal “business hub,” even though 29% said that describes their current environment.Instead, there’s a marked preference for:“This reflects a global trend away from rigid corporate settings,” the Gensler report states. The UAE is now ranked among the top five countries worldwide where employees show a strong preference for imaginative and wellness-focused workspaces.While flexible work is valued, UAE employees still see the office as essential. Respondents said 67% of their ideal workweek should be spent in the office, well above the global average of 60%. Yet actual attendance is lower, largely because current office setups aren’t meeting employee needs.Top reasons for in-office attendance include:However, only 28% of UAE workers believe their meeting spaces are adequately equipped to support these functions.Gensler’s survey also looked beyond the office walls. UAE employees showed a stronger-than-global-average preference for certain amenities both inside and around the workplace.Most valued in-office amenities:Preferred surrounding neighbourhood features:These preferences signal a broader desire for community-integrated, holistic work environments that support both professional productivity and personal wellbeing.","Uae employees want 67% of their workweek in-office, but only 31% feel their current spaces support their best work.

IAF’s fifth-generation stealth fighter project: US’ General Electric (GE) has said that it is ‘very interested’ in making engines for India’s fifth-generation stealth fighter project. It will compete to manufacture engines for the Indian Air Force's fifth-generation stealth fighter and advanced medium combat aircraft, GE chairman and CEO Larry Culp said.The aerospace giant views India as a key strategic market for both civilian and military aerospace operations, according to Culp.GE is also working to speed up delivery of F-404 jet engines to India’s Hindustan Aeronautics (HAL). GE says it has accelerated the supply of jet engines to HAL for the Tejas Mark-1A fighter programme, which has experienced significant delays. The company delivered its first F-404 engine from a total order of 99 units in March, approximately two years later than planned.""That is our intent and we've communicated that to everyone,"" Culp said. ""We are working with the suppliers to ramp their capability. We're making good progress. I just look at April and May of this year compared to where we were in the first quarter—we've seen a double-digit increase in the number of receipts,” he told ET in an interview.""We are very interested,"" Culp said. ""If you look at what we're doing with the Tejas with our 404 engines, we are right in the middle of probably what matters most in that regard. The US and India enjoy a very strong relationship. So we are here, we want to be supportive and are engaged so we possibly can be.""Also Read | India’s defence exports surge to record high of Rs 23,622 crore in FY25; 34-fold increase from 2013-14 India revealed its plans to expedite the development of a domestic fifth-generation stealth fighter last month.

GE will encounter competition from other industry leaders, including Safran and Rolls-Royce.Air Chief Marshal AP Singh, the IAF chief, has expressed worries regarding delays in acquiring essential military equipment. Production capacity limitations amongst manufacturers are causing setbacks in both defence programmes and commercial aviation deliveries.Culp indicated that despite implementing various measures to reduce the impact of delays, resolving supply chain issues will require additional time.""The progress we're achieving is substantial, both within GE and throughout the sector,"" he stated.
