No need for physical Aadhaar copies as new app enables digital verification,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-need-for-physical-aadhaar-copies-as-new-app-enables-digital-verification/articleshow/127738926.cms,".

New Delhi: Eliminating the need to submit physical copies of Aadhaar for verification or visiting Aadhaar centres for updating personal details, govt Wednesday launched the new Aadhaar app that will let people manage and verify their identities digitally.Aadhaar details will be stored securely on mobile devices, eliminating the need to carry and submit a physical card for the purposes of verification. Changes to addresses and mobile numbers can also now be made in minutes, subject to Unique Identification Authority of India’s ( UIDAI ) confirmation.Users will also be able to monitor their authentication history, meaning they will be able to keep a record of the places where their Aadhaar details has been used for verification, enhancing oversight and control over the use of their digital identity.At the event to unveil the new app, electronics and IT secretary S Krishnan said govt is conscious of privacy concerns and has built the platform around the principle of data minimisation and reports of Aadhaar data leaks in the past had stemmed largely from excessive data collection by third parties and not due to breaches in the central database.“Collection of Aadhaar data by these third parties creates vulnerability.This is what we are trying to minimise,” Krishnan further added.The app allows management of up to five Aadhaar profiles on a single device linked to the same phone number. It provides users with the ability to selectively share personal information, ensuring only the necessary details are disclosed and provides a QR code identity scan feature which will enable users to scan it at authorised terminals to confirm their identity securely and quickly.","Aadhaar details will be stored securely on mobile devices, eliminating the need to carry and submit a physical card for the purposes of verification.

NEW DELHI: Comptroller and Auditor General K Sanjay Murthy on Thursday raised his concern on excessive regulatory burdens that impede the competitiveness of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) and slow down industrial growth.“MSMEs-related reforms need to cut across multiple departments and levels of government — Centre, state, and local bodies,” Murthy said, and added that the effectiveness of reforms depends not only on policy intent, but on the coordination among departments, digital system integration, uniformity in implementation, and citizen and business feedback loops.The CAG’s remarks came while addressing a gathering of senior officials from the Centre and states from departments of MSMEs, statistics and industry representatives from CII, FICCI, Assocham, Phdcci and Fisme on auditor’s ongoing pan-India audit of ease of doing business for MSMEs.“We need a four-pronged strategy of simplification, digitalisation, decriminalisation, and elimination of redundant laws — all of which are highly relevant for MSMEs,” he said. The CAG said that ease of doing business and ease of living have become priority audits for the federal auditor, cutting across departments, geographies and sectors.The meeting was part of the auditor’s consultative process for its pan-India horizontal audit on ease of doing business (EoDB) for MSMEs being undertaken.Murthy further said that while the Centre has embarked on a comprehensive initiative to promote EoDB through systematic compliance reduction and deregulation, the real test of reforms lies in the last-mile outcomes. “The audit seeks to assess whether systems are delivering what they ought to,” he said.Murthy said “the MSME sector is not only critical for economic growth, but also for inclusive development, supporting entrepreneurship, strengthening supply chains, and creating livelihoods across rural and urban India”.The pan-India horizontal audit is outcome-oriented public sector auditing, aligned with national priorities and focused on improving service delivery for MSMEs. It will cover the period from 2021-22 to 2025-26, with field audits. The insights from this audit are expected to support governments in refining reforms, reducing compliance burdens and creating a more predictable, transparent and facilitative business environment, enabling MSMEs to focus on productivity, innovation and growth, according to CAG.eom..","Comptroller and auditor general k sanjay murthy raised his concern on excessive regulatory burdens that impede the competitiveness of micro, small and medium enterprises (msmes) the cag said that ease of doing business and ease of living have become priority audits for the federal auditor, cutting across departments, geographies and sectors.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127783588,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-152276,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
Centre to test RBI-enabled digital food coupons for free rations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-to-test-rbi-enabled-digital-food-coupons-for-free-rations/articleshow/127783489.cms,"NEW DELHI: Government is set to roll out a pilot for Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) or ‘digital food currency’ under the free ration scheme to a limited number of beneficiaries in Chandigarh, Puducherry and three districts of Gujarat next month. Under this, beneficiaries will receive monthly digital food coupons directly into an RBI-enabled digital wallet on their mobile phones and they will get the entitled free foodgrains from ration shops by simply scanning the shop owners’ QR code to redeem the coupons.This initiative is aimed at bringing greater transparency and plugging any leakage in the world’s largest free food security programme and relieving ration card holders from the hassle of biometric authentication. People aware about the plan said this will be conducted as a Proof of Concept (POC) for the “digital food currency” across three regions and will be at a small-scale to demonstrate the feasibility, functionality, and practical potential of the initiative.Government will also set a timeframe for using the digital coupon to avoid accumulation. Earlier this month, a soft launch was done in Ahmedabad with 25 beneficiaries.A state government official said since then around 2,000 transactions have been completed successfully. The pilot to be rolled out next month will cover Anand, Sabarmati and Dahod.In the case of Chandigarh and Puducherry, Centre had rolled out Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) scheme for foodgrains in 2015, which replaced physical foodgrain distribution with direct cash transfers to beneficiaries’ bank accounts. Officials said the digital food currency will ensure that beneficiaries are using the subsidy only for buying foodgrains and for no other purpose.Since there has been no provision of distribution of foodgrains in these two UTs, there are no ration shops. Officials said the authorities are exploring how certain outlets can be identified for distribution of free foodgrain by accepting the digital currency. They added that the free foodgrains which will be distributed through these outlets or ration shops will be supplied by the Food Corporation India (FCI) or state government agencies.Officials said options are also being explored to see that beneficiaries who still use basic or feature phones and hence can’t use the ewallet, can use the digital food food currency.","Government is set to roll out a pilot for central bank digital currency (cbdc) or ‘digital food currency’ under this, beneficiaries will receive monthly digital food coupons directly into an rbi-enabled digital wallet on their mobile phones.

'Your Freedom To Aspire': PM Modi Says India-EU FTA Will Create Countless Opportunities For Youth

New Delhi: PM Narendra Modi on Wednesday described the “historic” FTA between India and EU as a “global gamechanger” that would open countless opportunities for lakhs of Indian youths.Addressing a gathering at the annual National Cadet Corps PM Rally at Delhi Cantt, the PM said the entire world is looking at India’s youth with a “lot of trust” and the reason behind that trust is “skill and ‘sanskar’ (culture)”. He underlined that the agreement with 27 countries will benefit Indian startups by easing access to funding and innovation ecosystems, while also boosting India’s creative economy in films, gaming, fashion, digital content, music and design. He stated that the deal will create new opportunities for Indian youth in research, education, IT and professional services.Modi stressed that the deal would accelerate the Atmanirbhar Bharat campaign and strengthen the resolve of “Make in India, Make for the World”. He explained that under the agreement, tariffs on more than 99% of India’s exports will be either zero or very low, benefiting industries such as textiles, leather, gems and jewellery, footwear, engineering goods and MSMEs.The deal will also bring more investment into India, leading to new engineering, electronics, chemical, pharma and other manufacturing plants, while creating assured markets for agricultural and food processing products and fisheries, which will offer huge opportunities to farmers, fishermen and rural youth. He said the FTA would directly connect India’s youth to Europe’s job market, opening new avenues for them across 27 countries.","Pm narendra modi: india-eu fta will open countless opportunities for lakhs of indian youths.

What the deal covers

Under the FTA, duties will be cut on 99.5% of goods exported from India to the EU, including seafood and footwear.

In return, India will reduce or eliminate tariffs on 96.6% of goods imported from the EU, including phased cuts for European carmakers and alcohol producers.

Once implemented, the pact will create a combined market of nearly 2 billion people, spanning the world’s fourth-largest economy (India) and the second-largest economic bloc (EU).

Indian apparel manufacturers and gems and jewellery exporters are among the biggest gainers, as EU duties on these products will be cut to zero.

Domestic food producers will also get preferential access to the European market.

However, Indian automakers and liquor companies are expected to face stiffer competition as lower import levies make European products cheaper.

As companies await more details, here’s a look at who stands to gain and and who may lose:

Big winners

Apparel & textiles

Leather & footwear

Gems & jewellery

Food products & seafood

Benefits for India

Preferential access across 97% of tariff lines, covering 99.5% of trade value.

Immediate duty elimination for labour-intensive sectors such as textiles, leather, gems and jewellery.

Zero-duty entry for $33 billion worth of exports currently facing EU tariffs of 4–26%.

Sensitive sectors like dairy, cereals and poultry are protected.

Losers

Why the deal matters

NEW DELHI: India and the European Union on Tuesday announced the conclusion of negotiations for a landmark free trade agreement (FTA), ending talks that began nearly two decades ago.The ""mother of all deals"" is India’s 19th trade agreement and is expected to significantly boost exports to the 27-nation EU bloc while reshaping competition for several domestic industries.The agreement comes at a time when global trade flows have been disrupted by high US tariffs, fragile supply chains and geopolitical tensions, including the Russia-Ukraine war.India is currently facing steep tariffs from the US, while the EU is also under threat of higher American duties.India gains immediate zero-duty access to a $263 billion European textile market. The government said tariffs on textile imports will be eliminated immediately.CareEdge Ratings called the deal ""critical"" for improving competitiveness, estimating India could raise its EU market share to 9% from 5%, adding nearly $4.5 billion in annual exports over the medium term.Textile stocks reacted sharply, with KPR Mill, Welspun Living, and Kitex Garments posting strong gains, Bloomberg reported.Tariffs on leather and footwear have been slashed to zero from 17%, opening up a $100 billion EU market for Indian exporters.The EU has granted duty-free access to Indian gems and jewellery. Kirit Bhansali, chairman of the Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council, said bilateral trade could double to Rs 910 billion in the next three years.""This timely pact will help Indian exporters salvage lost ground,"" he said, noting that exports to the US have fallen sharply.Indian exporters of shrimp, frozen fish and value-added seafood products will get preferential access to the EU market. Producers of tea, coffee, spices, grapes and processed food will also benefit, while safeguards remain in place for sensitive sectors like dairy and poultry.The ""mother of all deals"" comes at a critical moment for the global economy, which has been unsettled by the unpredictable trade and tariff policies of US President Donald Trump.The landmark India–EU trade pact is expected to reduce both sides’ dependence on the United States and China.Negotiations, which began nearly two decades ago, gained momentum after tariffs imposed by the Trump administration on Indian and European goods disrupted global trade flows.The Trump administration has openly criticised the agreement.Earlier, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent alleged that Europe was effectively bankrolling the Russia-Ukraine war by purchasing energy products routed through India.He argued that European countries were weakening their own security by importing refined fuel from India that originates from Russian crude oil, while Washington imposed steep tariffs on Indian exports over New Delhi’s energy ties with Moscow.""We have put 25 per cent tariffs on India for buying Russian oil. Guess what happened last week? The Europeans signed a trade deal with India,"" Bessent said.However, Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal has dismissed suggestions that US tariffs played a role in pushing the deal forward, saying, ""I don’t think we even discussed this.""India has sharply cut tariffs on European alcohol. Duties on wine have been reduced to 20%, spirits to 40% (from as high as 150%), and beer to 50%.This is expected to intensify competition for Indian liquor firms. ""It’s a negative for Indian liquormakers,"" said Karan Taurani of Elara Securities. Shares of Sula Vineyards, United Breweries, and Radico Khaitan fell after the announcement.The pact allows up to 250,000 European vehicles to enter India at preferential rates, with tariffs gradually dropping from 110% to as low as 10%. Duties on auto components will also be scrapped over 5–10 years.Shares of Mahindra & Mahindra and Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles slipped following the news.Signed after nearly two decades of negotiations, the agreement marks India’s most ambitious trade pact so far and is set to reshape supply chains, pricing power and growth prospects across sectors.""Textiles, gems and jewellery, leather, pharma, and high-tech engineering"" will benefit from the deal, Munjal Almoula, managing partner for Tax & Regulatory Advisory at BDO India told Bloomberg.India’s goods trade with the EU stood at $136.5 billion in 2024-25, making the bloc its largest trading partner.The FTA is expected to be signed later this year, following legal vetting and approval by the European Parliament.","India and the european union announced the conclusion of negotiations for a landmark free trade agreement (fta) the ""mother of all deals"" is india’s 19th trade agreement.

What do these giant dinosaur footprints reveal about prehistoric life

Why this dinosaur footprint discovery is so important





Researchers have found some of the biggest dinosaur footprints ever. They are so huge that an adult could curl up inside one without a problem. It’s wild to imagine, honestly. This kind of find really turns our old ideas about prehistoric life on its head.This ancient print was uncovered along the Dampier Peninsula in Western Australia and is given the title of “ Largest dinosaur footprint ” by Guinness World Records. They are embedded in fossil-rich sandstone that dates to the Early Cretaceous, which was roughly 130 million years ago.The site stands out because the prints aren’t just massive; they’re deep and come in all kinds of shapes, showing off the variety of dinosaurs that wandered through this part of northwest Australia. It’s more than just proof of some truly gigantic creatures. These tracks give us a real peek into the world of Gondwana, the ancient southern supercontinent that once included Australia.A sauropod footprint that’s about 1.7 meters long, so just over 5 and a half feet, was found in this site. That’s the largest dinosaur footprint anyone’s ever found. Researchers from the University of Queensland and James Cook University matched these giant tracks to sauropods, those long-necked, plant-munching giants that once roamed the Earth.A vertebrate palaeontologist at the University of Queensland put it simply: some tracks here are so huge, most people could actually fit inside one. The dinosaurs that left them probably stood about 5.3 to 5.5 meters tall at the hip. Even for dinosaurs, that’s seriously massive.These footprints sit in what people now like to call Australia’s own Jurassic Park. Along the coast where the Broome Sandstone stretches out, scientists have found over 150 tracks from at least 21 different kinds of dinosaurs. We’re talking big meat-eaters like theropods, two-legged plant-eaters called ornithopods, armoured dinosaurs known as thyreophorans, and quite a few sauropods too.This makes the site one of the most varied dinosaur tracksites you’ll find anywhere, and it gives Australia some of its best proof of dinosaur life from the Early Cretaceous.The Broome Sandstone itself is seriously ancient. It started as river delta mud and sand, then, ages later, it showed up along today’s shoreline. What’s really cool is that a lot of these tracks sit out in the intertidal zone. They only appear when the tide’s out, so the timing has to be just right. It’s this odd bit of geology that’s turned the place into a goldmine for palaeontologists.For the first time in Australia, researchers have found confirmed stegosaur footprints. Evidence that these dinosaurs once roamed here, even though nobody had spotted them in the fossil record before.These tracks back up earlier discoveries highlighted by National Geographic , which pointed out how massive the Kimberley prints are and how much they reveal about dinosaur life in ancient times. And it’s not just about size. These trackways tell us how these giants moved, how they lived, and how they fit into their world. Footprints like these freeze a brief moment from the distant past, letting scientists study actual dinosaur behaviour, not just their bones.It’s wild to think about, but it really drives home just how huge and lively the ancient world was. These fossil tracks aren’t just old marks in the ground; they’re snapshots of colossal sauropods, bustling herds, and prehistoric landscapes frozen in stone. If you find yourself on the coast of Western Australia when the tide goes out, you’re literally walking over one of the greatest dinosaur stories we’ve ever uncovered.","Researchers have found some of the biggest dinosaur footprints ever. They are so huge that an adult could curl up inside one without a problem. This kind of find really turns our old ideas about prehistoric life on its head.

"Who is Joe Brady’s wife? Meet Lauren Brady, the woman stepping into focus after Bills’ surprise head coaching move",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/who-is-joe-bradys-wife-meet-lauren-brady-the-woman-stepping-into-focus-after-bills-surprise-head-coaching-move/articleshow/127663860.cms,"Joe Brady’s Wife Lauren (Instagram)

Who is Joe Brady’s wife Lauren Brady ?



Who is Joe Brady’s wife is suddenly a question many Buffalo Bills fans are asking, as the franchise turns a new page with a bold coaching decision. The Bills went inside the building to replace Sean McDermott, handing the job to offensive coordinator Joe Brady. The move signals urgency after seven straight playoff exits and no Super Bowl trips. At just 36, Brady represents a shift in philosophy, youth, and energy. With the spotlight now fixed on him, attention has naturally widened to include the person closest to him off the field.Brady steps into the role after four seasons with Buffalo, including three running an offense that was never the weak link. Even in a crushing 33-30 divisional playoff loss to Denver, the unit delivered 30 points. Now trusted with the entire operation, Brady begins his head coaching journey backed by a quarterback he knows well in Josh Allen, and by a steady presence at home.Joe Brady is married to Lauren Brady, formerly Lauren Bateman, and her story carries its own weight. The couple tied the knot on June 25, 2022, in a winery setting in Carmel Valley, California, after several years of dating and an engagement in June 2021. They are now parents to two young children, a son born in April 2023 and a daughter welcomed in late 2025.Lauren’s professional path has been anything but linear. In her early 20s, she built health and fitness websites and earned about $4,000 a month, until a sudden Google algorithm change wiped out the business. She pivoted to teaching music, only to find the workload draining and unsustainable. Determined to regain control, she moved into helping others grow businesses and even opened two commercial teaching locations. Then 2020 hit, and government shutdowns erased 35 percent of her revenue.Instead of folding, Lauren adapted again. She leaned fully into online music education, posting her first guitar video on YouTube in 2017. Early feedback was rough, but persistence paid off. By April 2020, her online guitar courses generated $16,000 in a single month. That year ended with $120,000 in total revenue from courses and advertising. Today, her business reportedly brings in between $65,000 and $150,000 each month, supported by more than 600,000 subscribers and over 50 million views.As Joe Brady takes on the biggest job of his career, Lauren’s resilience mirrors the mindset Buffalo hopes will finally carry the Bills to the sport’s highest stage. On 29th January, Brady was introduced as the coach and while delivering his first speech as HC, he did not forget to give all credit to his wife for his career and personal life.","Joe brady is married to lauren brady, formerly lauren bateman.

Google AI CEO Demis Hassabis says he is very proud of Apple partnership as iPhone maker ran a very…,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/google-ai-ceo-demis-hassabis-says-he-is-very-proud-of-apple-partnership-as-iphone-maker-ran-a-very/articleshow/127678468.cms,"Apple has chosen Google's Gemini AI for its foundation models, a multi-year deal reportedly worth around $1 billion annually. This partnership, confirmed this month, signifies a major shift for Apple, which previously favored in-house development. The revamped Siri, powered by Gemini, is expected with iOS 26.4, aiming for a March/April rollout.

Apple weighed options from OpenAI and Anthropic before settling on Google

Hassabis sees room for the partnership to grow





Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis isn't hiding his satisfaction over the Apple deal. In an interview with Alex Heath, Hassabis said he's proud that Gemini came out on top after Apple put multiple AI providers through a thorough evaluation. He added that Google has ideas for efficient AI models that could work well on edge devices like phones and even in robotics.The multi-year partnership, confirmed earlier this month, means Apple's foundation models will now be built on Gemini and Google's cloud technology. A joint statement from both companies said Apple found Google's AI to be the most capable option available. The models will still run on Apple devices and its Private Cloud Compute infrastructure, keeping the company's privacy commitments intact.According to Bloomberg, Apple is shelling out roughly $1 billion a year for a custom 1.2 trillion parameter Gemini model. The company evaluated offerings from Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reported that OpenAI was never really in the running, while Anthropic led early discussions before pricing talks broke down.The Financial Times pegged the deal's total value at around $5 billion for Google, structured as cloud services rather than a straight licensing arrangement. The revamped Siri powered by Gemini is expected to arrive with iOS 26.4, which should hit beta in February before a wider rollout in March or April.Asked about where Google wants to place Gemini versus keeping it exclusive to its own products, Hassabis said it depends on the situation. He noted that Google still has an edge with first-party devices because it can tightly integrate models with product surfaces. But he made clear the company is keen on enterprise business and deeper collaborations with partners that bring strong ecosystems to the table.For Apple, the deal represents a notable departure from its usual playbook of building everything in-house. The company pushed back its major Siri overhaul from spring 2025 to 2026 and moved AI chief John Giannandrea away from product development. The partnership also builds on a long history between the two tech giants—Google already pays Apple billions annually to remain the default search engine on iPhones.","Apple has chosen google's gemini ai for its foundation models, a multi-year deal reportedly worth around $1 billion annually.

UAE residents outsourcing their brains to AI: Are we losing our minds?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-residents-outsourcing-their-brains-to-ai-are-we-losing-our-minds/articleshow/127776060.cms,"UAE AI Adoption: Chatbots Become Everyday Partners for Residents

How UAE Residents Are Outsourcing Their Thinking to AI Chatbots And What It Says About the Future

The psychology of outsourcing thought to AI







In the United Arab Emirates, artificial intelligence is no longer a niche technology used only by tech companies. It is becoming an integral part of how people think, shop, work, plan and even solve day-to-day problems. As AI adoption accelerates, many residents are turning to chatbots and generative AI assistants not just for simple queries, but for complex decision-making, creativity and personalised support.Reports and surveys show that AI use in the UAE is among the highest in the world, with generative AI tools integrated into work, study and personal life. A 2025 study found that nearly two-thirds of working-age adults actively use AI tools like ChatGPT, Gemini or Claude in their routines , placing the UAE at the forefront of global AI adoption.One of the most striking trends is how many UAE residents now use AI assistants to guide their research, choices and day-to-day tasks. For example, a recent retail report found that 70% of UAE consumers have used AI assistants for shopping, whether for product discovery, comparison or personalised recommendations, more than double the average rate in Europe, the Middle East and Africa region.This shift reflects a broader pattern with information overload, busy lifestyles and instant expectations, consumers increasingly prefer to offload cognitive tasks to AI, letting algorithms sift through data, suggest options and even make choices they might previously have wrestled with themselves.In essence, many users are beginning to see chatbots not just as tools for answers but as thinking partners that can help them organise trips, manage errands, generate ideas or draft content, effectively outsourcing parts of their cognitive load to AI systems.The influence of AI extends well beyond shopping. Microsoft-backed reports have highlighted that the UAE workforce has one of the highest AI adoption rates globally, with nearly 60% of workers regularly using AI tools like Copilot, ChatGPT and others in professional tasks such as drafting emails, preparing reports, analysing data and even automating routine responsibilities.Likewise, LinkedIn data shows that 80% of UAE professionals are using AI tools regularly, up sharply from the previous year, often treating AI as a sort of second job assistant that enhances productivity and extends creative capabilities. This widespread integration has turned AI chatbots into more than mere utilities. For many, they are cognitive extensions that help process information, generate ideas and complete complex tasks faster than humans alone could.AI chatbots have also found a place in public life and government services across the UAE. Platforms like Rammas, an AI assistant from Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, have answered millions of resident queries, helping people manage their utility accounts, understand bills and navigate service issues.Similarly, industry-specific chatbots such as mortgage chat assistants launched during Dubai AI Week, are helping residents make significant financial decisions by comparing real-time mortgage options and documentation requirements through conversational interfaces. These tools showcase how chatbots are transitioning from ad-hoc helpers to core components of a smart, digital lifestyle where technical expertise, bureaucratic navigation and personal decision-making can all be mediated by AI.The UAE’s national AI strategy and initiatives like ChatGPT Plus access for residents, though not fully free yet but part of broader talks under the Stargate UAE initiative, reflect government ambitions to embed AI more deeply in everyday life. These efforts aim to empower individuals and businesses alike with advanced AI tools as part of the country’s vision to become a global AI hub by 2031.By expanding access and literacy around AI, the policy push encourages residents to incorporate chatbots not just for simple queries but as trusted aides in research, planning, education and even creative work.While residents are enthusiastic about AI’s convenience, using bots to cut through online noise, get fast insights and automate routine tasks, there are also questions about trust and limitations. For example, surveys show that while many UAE consumers enjoy interacting with AI for basic support, a majority still prefer human contact for complex or sensitive issues such as customer disputes or trouble-shooting technical problems.This trust gap underscores a central tension in the AI adoption story: people like the speed and accessibility of chatbots but often hesitate to fully delegate important decisions or nuanced problem-solving to machines.Beyond practical tasks, research from behavioural studies suggests that heavy reliance on AI chatbots can shape how people approach decisions, relationships and social interaction. Longer and more intense AI use has been correlated with increased feelings of dependence and in some cases, reduced social engagement, highlighting psychological nuances in human-AI relationships that go well beyond utility.Though these findings are global and not UAE-specific, they point to broader implications of a society where AI is deeply woven into daily life, especially in a place like the UAE, where adoption rates are among the highest in the world. Outsourcing thinking to AI is not just about convenience, it suggests a shift in cognitive culture. Residents increasingly expect AI to anticipate their needs, synthesise vast amounts of information and help them make choices quickly and confidently.In workplaces, homes and government services, chatbots are becoming collaborators in thought processes rather than mere assistants. This transformation reflects both the UAE’s technological ambition and a global trend toward human-AI collaboration that will likely define the coming decade, with profound effects on how people learn, decide, interact and live.","Artificial intelligence is no longer a niche technology used only by tech companies. It is becoming an integral part of how people think, work, plan and even solve day-to-day problems. As ai adoption accelerates, many residents are turning to chatbots and generative ai assistants for complex decision-making.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127790462,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-20666,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Nokia taught a generation how to connect, Angry Birds became a national timepass, and KONE quietly lifts millions of Indians every day in offices and apartment towers. Now, the same country that once drove our everyday tech habits is pitching something bigger - a place to study, build and work in fields such as AI and deep tech. According to industry voices, Finland's need for skilled professionals - supported by govt policies seen as favourable for work mobility and startups - has opened up roles for the Indian youth in various fields, be it data science, machine learning, computer vision or generative AI.Laura Lindeman, senior director of 'Work in Finland' at Business Finland, says the country is not just hiring youths with experience in AI, but also investing to scale up its R&D. ""Finland is in the process of attracting top deep tech researchers and specialists in areas such as artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, microelectronics, photonics, imaging and health tech. In addition to excellent opportunities for professional and personal development, experts working in Finland benefit from a strong national commitment to R&D. The country already invests 3.2% of its GDP in research and development, and govt aims to increase this share to 4% by 2030.For Indian candidates from these fields, this means more opportunities to access world-class research infrastructure and build careers in companies and universities that play a key role in driving global innovation,"" she adds.The message also came through at a recent AI summit in Turku, where the Finnish govt underlined its ambition to be a serious player in the global AI race, keeping international collaboration at the centre. PM Petteri Orpo described it as a strategic imperative. ""Europe must lead, not follow, in the AI revolution,"" he said.At the summit, discussions were also undertaken on how the Finnish market requires diverse skillsets, from technical to creative problem-solving expertise. For Indian students and professionals, the subtext was clear - Finland wants talent, and it wants it now.But the opportunities are not limited to those looking for jobs alone. For those interested in startups, Finland's ecosystem provides a fertile ground, characterised by a dynamic startup culture and high levels of innovation in AI research, doctoral roles, and advanced computing facilities like LUMI supercomputer, one of the world's most powerful supercomputers located in Kajaani.For students too, Finland's latest push in R&D means availability of globally recognised AI courses that are closely linked with industry projects. The inauguration of the ELLIS Institute this Nov was a crucial step in this regard, fostering an environment conducive to cutting-edge research.","Finland is pitching itself as a place to study, build and work in fields such as ai and deep tech.

Riyadh is rapidly growing as a headquarters destination, with policy incentives and infrastructure attracting global corporate functions. Dubai’s ongoing role: Despite competitive pressure, Dubai remains a vital centre for finance, commerce and technology in the region, offering market access and business services many firms value.

Looking ahead: Corporate strategy in a shifting Gulf







Global payments giant Visa is reorganising its Middle East operations, a move that reflects how Saudi Arabia ’s “regional headquarters” policy is rewriting the corporate map of the Gulf. The US-based company’s latest structural shift comes amid intensifying competition among Gulf states for foreign investment, talent and economic clout.Traditionally, many multinational firms have used Dubai as their preferred base for Middle East regional management thanks to its advanced business infrastructure, liberal policies and cosmopolitan workforce. However, Saudi Arabia’s rule (introduced in 2024) now requires companies to establish a local regional HQ if they want to be eligible for government contracts. This has prompted firms across sectors to reconsider how they structure their regional presence and operations.Under Visa’s updated setup, its Middle East activities have been split into two separate hubs:Both clusters remain part of Visa’s broader regional grouping under Central and Eastern Europe, Middle East and Africa but mark a clear acknowledgment of Riyadh’s rising role in regional corporate governance. Visa’s move follows Saudi Arabia’s push to encourage more foreign companies to base their regional headquarters in the Kingdom.According to Riyadh’s government, more than 700 multinationals have already set up regional HQs in Saudi Arabia since the rule took effect, signalling broad compliance and a competitive push by the Gulf’s largest economy.Saudi Arabia’s regional headquartering policy is a cornerstone of its economic diversification strategy under Vision 2030, a sweeping plan to transform the oil-dependent economy into a diversified global business hub. As part of this strategy, the Kingdom is using regulatory incentives and requirements to attract multinational firms into sectors such as finance, technology and infrastructure.Under the HQ rule, companies wishing to bid on government contracts or participate fully in state-sponsored economic programmes must have a formal regional headquarters in Saudi Arabia. This has had a direct impact on how global firms define their operations and allocate resources across the Middle East.Visa, for example, could have chosen to relocate its entire regional office to Riyadh. Instead, it opted for a dual-hub approach, balancing retention of its presence in Dubai with a newly empowered Riyadh centre that satisfies Saudi requirements. This strategy lets Visa maintain access to both major markets while complying with policy demands.Visa’s reorganisation is part of a larger pattern of companies responding to shifting commercial incentives in the Gulf. Saudi Arabia has increasingly used economic policy levers such as tax breaks, infrastructure investment and HQ mandates to lure foreign capital and expertise. Global banks like BNY Mellon, Goldman Sachs and Citigroup have also announced or received licences to set up senior regional headquarters in Riyadh in recent years, underscoring the trend.Dubai, meanwhile, has long been established as the Middle East’s business leader, drawing firms with its robust legal system, easier mobility and longstanding reputation as a gateway between East and West. Visa’s decision to keep its UAE operations anchored in Dubai while expanding Riyadh oversight reflects the ongoing balancing act multinational corporations face as they weigh regulatory access against talent markets and operational efficiency.This development must be viewed against the backdrop of broader shifts in Gulf labour and visa policies. Saudi Arabia has been liberalising parts of its system like abolishing the old Kafala sponsorship regime in 2025 and granting workers more mobility to make the Kingdom more attractive to expatriates and skilled professionals.Visa restructuring also intersects with visa and mobility reform in the region, which includes initiatives like the GCC unified visa proposal and mutual visa-waiver agreements between Saudi Arabia and countries such as Russia, designed to stimulate tourism, business and cultural exchange.Visa’s move highlights several key trends for businesses and investors operating in the Middle East -Visa’s operational restructure is a snapshot of how economic policy and corporate strategy intersect in a region defined by rapid transformation. As Saudi Arabia continues its push to diversify the economy and attract foreign firms through targeted regulations, companies will likely continue finding creative ways to balance compliance, market presence and operational efficiency.For multinational firms, choosing where to base key functions is no longer just about infrastructure and talent. It is about being strategically aligned with regional policy priorities and maximising long-term growth in one of the world’s most dynamic economic theatres.","Visa splits middle east operations as saudi hq rule reshapes regional business strategy.

Why the change?





In a move that has sent ripples through the expat community, Saudi Arabia has officially restricted four high-ranking professions to Saudi nationals.On January 29, 2026, reports confirmed that the government’s Qiwa platform, the central hub for labor services, has stopped accepting requests to change expat professions to these specific roles. The most significant blow is the total reservation of the ""General Manager"" title for Saudi citizens.According to sources from Okaz and Yemen Press, the profession has been completely removed from the residency options available to foreigners. Existing expat managers are being urged to transition into alternative titles like ""CEO"" or ""Chairman,"" provided they meet strict commercial registry requirements.The government has suspended changes to professional titles and job classifications for expats in certain senior and commercial roles through its official labour platform, Qiwa. The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development (MHRSD) is not just targeting top-tier leadership; the new rules extend into the core of the private sector’s revenue-generating departments.The four restricted roles for expats now include:Starting this month, companies with three or more employees in marketing and sales must ensure that 60% of their team is Saudi.Furthermore, these local employees must be paid a minimum monthly salary of SAR 5,500 (for sales/marketing) or SAR 8,000 (for engineering/technical roles) to count toward the company’s localization quota.For expatriates, these changes are significant because employers now legally cannot offer or update certain job titles for non-Saudi workers, even after successful interviews. When a job category is fully Saudized, the work permit process simply cannot proceed for foreign candidates in those roles.The system also places limits on the total number of expatriates that can be employed within each profession. Once those quotas are filled, companiesfor more foreign workers, regardless of demand or skill level.For employers, this means adjusting recruitment strategies to prioritise Saudi nationals and rethinking staffing plans to comply with evolving labour regulations. Non-compliance can lead to hiring blocks, fines, or operational setbacks.This isn't just about numbers; it's about the ""quality"" of employment. The Saudi government, led by Minister Ahmed Al-Rajhi, is pushing to move citizens from entry-level positions into strategic, decision-making roles.By banning expats from holding ""General Manager"" titles, the Ministry is ensuring that the leadership culture of the private sector becomes fundamentally Saudi. This shift is a core part of Vision 2030, aiming to lower the unemployment rate of citizens by providing them with high-value career paths that were historically dominated by foreign talent.For the thousands of expatriates currently working in these fields, the impact is immediate. While those currently in their roles have a short ""corrective"" period, no new visas or profession changes will be granted for these titles. Businesses have been given a three-month grace period to align their staff with the new 60% marketing and sales quotas.For the common resident, this means a more competitive job market for foreigners in specialized roles and a clear signal that the Kingdom is prioritizing its youth for the country's most influential desk jobs.","Saudi arabia has officially restricted four high-ranking professions to saudi nationals.
