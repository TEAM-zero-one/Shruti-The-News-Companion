'Biggest AI Summit': Ashwini Vaishnaw Says India AI Impact Summit Getting 'Phenomenal Response'

Artificial intelligence has an exciting role to play in fields like drug discovery, scientific progress and disease treatment. But given the pace at which it is evolving, there is a real prospect of AI becoming more powerful than its creator, warns Tim Berners-Lee, British computer scientist and inventor of the World Wide Web.Humanity will have to figure out to how deal with super intelligence, says Berners-Lee, striking a note of caution at a time when companies and govts seem to be in a race to develop AI without really thinking through the consequences.Speaking to Jaya Bhattacharji Rose, Berners-Lee described ChatGPT as a ""phase change"", which surprised him with its conversational power. He emphasised that the critical question is who an AI works for.He argued for assistants that serve the user's best interests - analogous to a doctor's duty - rather than corporate incentives. He connected this to his Solid project and his company's work on user-controlled data ""pods"", aiming to restore agency by letting individuals control and selectively share their personal data, including in child-safe configurations with parental oversight.Berners-Lee also contrasted the early web's democratic spirit with today's platform-dominated experience. In the beginning, individuals could publish their own websites and participate on equal footing with major institutions.","Tim berners-lee, inventor of the world wide web, spoke to jaya bhattacharji rose.

NEW DELHI: Niti Aayog has proposed a roadmap for a net zero pathway for the transport sector which includes phasing out diesel vehicles and focusing on cleaner technologies, as well as tightening Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency (CAFE) norms.“The transition strategy should begin with the phased elimination of polluting diesel vehicles and the adoption of lower-emission technologies such as CNG, hybrids, and electric vehicles ,” said the report, while laying down a long-term pathway to achieve net zero transport emissions by 2070.The report, released Tuesday, said the transition would begin with gradual removal of diesel vehicles and a shift towards cleaner technologies such as CNG, hybrids and electric vehicles. In the next phase, the focus will be on greater use of biofuels through flex-fuel vehicles (FFVs), higher Bio-CNG blending and hybrid FFV models, while electric vehicle adoption continues to rise. The final phase is a full shift to zero-emission vehicles.Niti Aayog said road transport depended heavily on fossil fuels, with petrol and diesel accounting for more than 80% of energy consumption. The think tank warned that India’s ability to cut emissions will also depend on how effectively it enforced CAFE norms.",Niti aayog has proposed a roadmap for a net zero pathway for the transport sector.

Age, experience, and roster balance

Current status

As of February 2026,has not signed with the Cleveland Guardians. There is no trade and no agreement in place. He is still a free agent. The connection between McCutchen and Cleveland comes from projections and offseason speculation, not from any official announcement.The idea has gained attention because it makes practical sense. Cleveland needs experienced hitting, and McCutchen has said he wants to keep playing. If both sides agree on a short contract and a defined role, a deal would be straightforward.Andrew McCutchen’s one-year, $5 million contract with the Pittsburgh Pirates ended after the 2025 season. Because of that, he can sign with any team without compensation.If Cleveland Guardians moves forward, the contract would likely be for one year in the $2–4 million range, possibly with incentives tied to plate appearances or health. He would project as the designated hitter and could make occasional starts in left or right field.Cleveland’s projected roster remains young.• Outfield: Steven Kwan, Nolan Jones, George Valera, with David Fry as depth.• First base/DH: Kyle Manzardo and C.J. Kayfus, with Kayfus expected to see DH at-bats.Signing McCutchen would likely push Kayfus into more of a platoon role and give manager Stephen Vogt a right-handed hitter to balance a lineup that leans left-handed.Andrew McCutchen hit .239/.333/.367 with 13 home runs and 57 RBIs in 2025. That production is modest but steady for a player entering his age-39 season. He has historically handled right-handed pitching well, which would complement Cleveland’s lineup.He would also add experience to a group built around Bo Naylor, Steven Kwan, Nolan Jones, George Valera, and C.J. Kayfus. The financial risk would be limited because the deal would almost certainly be short-term.McCutchen has said he wants to play in 2026 and has expressed frustration about limited communication from Pittsburgh Pirates’ front office. With Marcell Ozuna expected to fill the DH role there, opportunities appear limited.Cleveland could offer the same type of usage McCutchen has had in recent seasons - mostly DH with limited time in the field.Letting McCutchen walk would create roster space and payroll flexibility while keeping the focus on younger players. Team leadership has also indicated the organization is open to working with him again in some capacity after his playing career.• Adds a right-handed bat for DH and occasional outfield work• Brings experience to a young clubhouse• Requires only a short financial commitment• Age and injury risk, including recent Achilles issues• Could reduce opportunities for younger hitters• Power production is no longer at peak levels• Opportunity to extend his career• Chance to join a competitive rosterCons for McCutchen• Likely a reduced role• Performance decline could affect how his late career is viewedMcCutchen’s numbers are similar to Cleveland’s current DH options but provide more right-handed power.These splits help explain why he could fit as a platoon option against right-handed starters.Andrew McCutchen turns 39 in October 2026 and has played 17 MLB seasons, including 12 with Pittsburgh. He is a five-time All-Star and the 2013 National League MVP.Cleveland Guardians’ projected lineup is younger: Bo Naylor (25), George Valera (25), Kyle Manzardo (25), C.J. Kayfus (24), Nolan Jones (27), and Steven Kwan (28). Aside from Jose Ramirez (33) and reliever Shawn Armstrong (35), the roster has few older players. McCutchen would add experience without needing to play every day.Also read: MLB trade rumors: San Diego Padres consider 15 million San Francisco Giants star to address rotation depth before 2026 season McCutchen remains unsigned. Nothing has been finalized between him and Cleveland. The possibility is reasonable but unresolved, and any deal would depend on Cleveland’s willingness to spend modestly and McCutchen’s interest in leaving Pittsburgh for a new situation.","Andrew mccutchen’s one-year, $5 million contract with the pittsburgh pirates ended after the 2025 season.

Apple iPhone 17e price (expected)

Apple is reportedly gearing up to announce the successor to last year’s iPhone 16e. Likely to be called iPhone 17e, the smartphone “is due imminently”, claims Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman in the latest edition of his weekly PowerOn newsletter. “Apple will market the 17e heavily to users in emerging economies and enterprises — two areas the company plans to target aggressively this year with both devices and software,” Gurman writes in the newsletter. He also shared that the phone will come with a few “big changes” that include iPhone 17’s A19 chipset and MagSafe charging, among others.The upcoming iPhone 17e, Gurman says will be powered by the A19 chip that comes with iPhone 17. The A19 offers a modest boost in CPU speed compared to the A18, but most of its improvement is in GPU, thus allowing it to be even better for AI features and gaming.Further, the handset is tipped to get MagSafe charging feature. Another change coming the iPhone 17e is that it may be equipped with Apple’s newest in-house cellular and wireless chips.Korean news outlet The Elec previously reported that the iPhone 17e is expected to feature slimmer display bezels while retaining the iPhone 14-era OLED panel. Other major new features include an 18MP front camera with Center Stage. This camera automatically extends to show everybody in a group selfie, even when you hold the phone vertically.As far as the pricing of the upcoming iPhone 17e is concerned, Gurman says that the company is planning to keep pricing the same as iPhone 16e. To recall, iPhone 16e launched in 2025 with a price tag of $599 or Rs 59,900 in India.","Apple is reportedly gearing up to announce the successor to last year’s iphone 16e.

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have kept their wedding plans under wraps but the Kansas City Chiefs’ star player’s ex girlfriend, Kayla Nicole, continues to take digs at the high profile couple.Though Travis Kelce and Kayla Nicole broke up a year before he met Taylor Swift, the popular social media influencer continues to be trolled because of her controversial comments.A few months ago, in September 2025, Kayla Nicole opened up about finances in a relationship on her podcast, The Pre Game With Kayla Nicole.As Kayla Nicole discussed Heather Sanders saying the “greatest thing a man can give a woman is getting married”, she said, ""I respectfully disagree….”The popular social media influencer added, “The most player sh*t you could do is put an M in her bank account…”Kayla Nicole continued, “Give her a kid.

But I think generational wealth is the greatest thing you can give a woman.""Interestingly, this is not the first time that popular social media influencer, Kayla Nicole, has opened up about her opinions on finances in a relationship.When Travis Kelce was accused of dividing expenses with her while they were dating, Kayla Nicole made a strong statement where she opened up on how she “does not do 50/50”.Over the last few years, some of her controversial comments have gotten her brutally trolled.While Kayla Nicole has maintained that she hates her identity centering around her ex boyfriend, Travis Kelce, she recently took a dig at Taylor Swift in a new commercial for Super Bowl.This has sparked outrage among fans as many have felt that she has been unable to move ahead in her life after ending things with Travis Kelce in 2022.However, Travis Kelce and the billionaire pop star, Taylor Swift have always remained distant from Kayla Nicole and have not issued any statements despite her strong controversial comments against them.With Kayla Nicole getting brutally trolled for her recent dig, she even ended up removing the Super Bowl commercial from her social media account.","Kayla nicole again dragged in taylor swift and travis kelce in her recent appearance on her podcast, the pre game with kayla nicole.

UAE Indians: Are You Ready for India's New Chip-Enabled e-Passport?

e-Passport application process for UAE residents







Indian expatriates in the United Arab Emirates are being urged to adopt India’s new chip-enabled e- Passport , a modern travel document designed to make international journeys faster, safer and more secure while aligning with global immigration standards. The rollout is part of India’s Passport Seva Programme 2.0 (GPSP 2.0), which modernises passport services through digital platforms and stronger security features.Unlike traditional passports, the e-Passport embeds a secure Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chip that stores the holder’s biometric data, including photograph and fingerprints, in encrypted form directly inside the booklet. The presence of the embedded chip is usually identified by a small gold-coloured symbol on the front cover.This RFID-equipped document conforms to International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) standards, meaning it is recognised globally for automated identity verification and enhanced security. UAE-based Indians can now apply for these e-Passports through the Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi or the Consulate in Dubai, with the rollout officially starting in October 2025 under GPSP 2.0.One of the biggest advantages of the e-Passport is reduced immigration wait times, travellers using automated lanes such as SmartGates and e-gates at airports can move through border control much more quickly compared with manual checks.Reports indicate that such streamlined checks can cut average wait times from roughly 25 minutes to under five at key UAE airports.These faster channels are not limited to the UAE as Indian e-Passport holders may benefit from automated border controls in countries such as Singapore, Australia and others that support e-Passport infrastructure, making travel smoother for frequent flyers.The embedded chip in the e-Passport uses advanced encryption and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) technology to ensure that biometric and identity data is securely stored and authenticated at international checkpoints. This makes it significantly harder for fraudsters to tamper with or forge passport information, enhancing overall travel document integrity.Such security upgrades align with global efforts to reduce passport fraud and identity theft, giving travellers and authorities more confidence in document authenticity.The shift to e-Passports is part of a larger digital overhaul under Passport Seva Programme 2.0 (GPSP 2.0), an upgraded system for issuing passports that emphasises ease of application, transparency and online services. GPSP 2.0 enables applicants to upload photographs, signatures and documents online, reducing reliance on physical forms and cutting waiting times at service centres like BLS International.For Indian residents in the UAE, estimated at around 3.5 million, this means a digital, end-to-end passport application experience that lowers bureaucratic friction and improves user convenience.Yes, existing passports without a chip remain valid until their expiration. Indian missions in the UAE have clarified that no extra biometrics or fees are required solely because of the e-Passport rollout. Applicants who provided biometrics recently will not be asked to give them again just because of the new document type.However, travellers planning long-term travel or frequent international journeys are encouraged to transition early to the e-Passport to enjoy the full suite of benefits proactively.From October 28, 2025, all Indian passport applications in the UAE, including renewals and new passports, must be filed through the GPSP 2.0 portal, which supports online registration, document upload and appointment booking at BLS centres in Dubai and Abu Dhabi.Applicants should ensure their photographs comply with ICAO standards to avoid delays or rejection. These strict photo requirements were introduced in September 2025 and apply to all passport applications, including e-Passports.India’s new chip-enabled e-Passport represents a major leap in travel document technology, offering faster immigration processing, enhanced security and future-proof compatibility with global systems.

Early birds still get the best deals, especially in Economy Class



When is the Cheapest Time to Book Emirates Flights in 2026?

Takeaway:

Best booking windows: Strategy and seasonal trends



6–8 weeks before departure often yields lower Economy fares than booking at the last minute, especially for long-haul flights.

Booking mid-week (Tuesdays and Wednesdays) rather than weekends may further increase odds of a deal because airlines frequently adjust prices to stimulate bookings on slower days.

Off-peak travel months, such as shoulder seasons outside summer and major holidays, tend to offer better pricing than peak times like July or late December.

Use Emirates’ own tools and guarantees



Low Fare Calendar: Emirates’ official booking system shows a calendar view of fares, letting you compare prices across flexible dates and spot cheaper travel windows.

Emirates’ official booking system shows a calendar view of fares, letting you compare prices across flexible dates and spot cheaper travel windows. Best Price Guarantee: If you find a lower price elsewhere for the exact same Emirates flight, the airline promises to refund the difference (terms apply).

Mid-week and time-of-day tips



Mid-week bookings and mid-week travel often offer lower rates than weekend travel.

Some data, for airlines in general, suggest booking at odd hours (late night or early morning) can reveal hidden dips in dynamic pricing, though this is not specific to Emirates’ own official pricing logic.

If you are planning to fly with Emirates in 2026, whether for leisure, family trips or work, timing your booking right can make a significant difference in airfare costs. According to reports, Emirates just recorded its busiest January for family travel ever, with the majority of passengers booking two to three months in advance, showing that early planning often leads to better pricing and seat availability.Here’s how travelers can navigate Emirates pricing trends and save on flights this year.Emirates reports that most Economy Class seats for popular routes were claimed by travellers who booked weeks or months ahead of departure, particularly during school holiday periods and major travel seasons. More than 65% of family and group bookings happened at least two to three months before departure and that early demand helped the airline fill planes without resorting to heavy discounting later.Booking early, around 2–3 months before travel, increases chances of finding lower fares, especially for Economy and window seats on popular international routes.Industry fare trackers, including those used by travel experts, suggest some general sweet spots for airline bookings that align with Emirates pricing patterns:These timing strategies, while not unique to Emirates, are broadly supported by airfare analytics across global carriers and hint at fare behaviour that dynamic pricing systems often follow.Emirates offers some built-in online tools that can help budget-minded travelers -Using these features directly on emirates.com can ensure you are not overpaying and may unlock savings you would not find on third-party sites.Travel experts say fare fluctuations are influenced by how busy search engines and airlines’ pricing algorithms are at various times:Being flexible not only with how far ahead you book but also with your departure and return days can help uncover lower ticket prices.Historically, Emirates, like most airlines, charges a premium for last-minute bookings. Data suggest that fares typically increase sharply in the last few weeks before travel, especially during popular holiday windows like spring breaks, summer vacations and year-end festivals.That pattern echoes broader airline pricing behaviour, where demand surges close to departure force up prices as remaining seats get scarcer.Travel patterns show Emirates passengers prioritise family and group travel to destinations such as Dubai, Jeddah, Istanbul, Bangkok and Rome, often linked to school calendars and tourism peak periods and those patterns can push pricing up early.If your schedule allows flexibility, consider flying to high-demand destinations outside peak holiday periods to lock in better rates.While not specific to Emirates’ official pricing, some travel platforms and deal sites list seasonal promo codes and airline discounts (like 10% off offers) that can occasionally apply to Emirates bookings. These deals are typically time-limited and require quick action to redeem.Sign up for newsletter alerts, airline membership programs (e.g., Emirates Skywards) and fare trackers to catch these short-term discounts.If you fly often, Emirates’ Skywards loyalty program can further reduce effective costs through miles redemption for flights or upgrades, especially if you accumulate points via partners or co-branded credit cards. For travelers aiming to reduce fare expenses over time, this is a long-term strategy worth exploring alongside smart booking timing.For travellers eyeing better Emirates flight prices in 2026, timing is still one of the most powerful tools. The early-booking trend revealed in recent travel patterns indicates that passengers securing tickets months in advance, particularly for family travel in Economy Class, enjoy more competitive pricing and smoother travel planning.By combining early planning, flexible dates, smart fare search tools and loyalty programs, you can significantly improve your odds of finding lower Emirates airfare and stretching your travel budget farther.",When is the cheapest time to book emirates flights in 2026?

Kyedae Shymko and Sakura Shymko face online backlash after breakups with Tyson Ngo and JasonTheWeen





Sakura Shymko and Kyedae Shymko have been all over social media this week. Many people were asking the same question. Are they related or is it just a coincidence? Yes they are sisters. The sudden buzz started after both of them confirmed breakups just one day apart. That timing caught everyone’s attention online.Kyedae Shymko shared on February 8 that she and Tyson Ngo known as TenZ had ended their six year relationship. A day later JasonTheWeen said he and Sakura Shymko were no longer together. With two well known streamer couples breaking up in the same week fans quickly began connecting dots and creating theories.Kyedae Shymko was the first to speak. She posted that she and TenZ had actually been apart for some time before making it public. She explained that they realized they were no longer growing as individuals.She made it clear there was no cheating and no bad blood. Soon after JasonTheWeen announced his split from Sakura Shymko.He said the breakup was mutual and that both still respected each other. An emotional clip of him went viral which led to rumors.Later on a livestream he directly denied cheating claims and asked people to stop spreading false stories.Still the internet did not slow down. Some users claimed TenZ had paused parts of his career to support Kyedae.That led TenZ to respond himself. He called the accusations strange and said the hate toward Kyedae was unnecessary.Posts on X added more fuel. One user wrote “Why did you post this after TenZ’s breakup Is there any correlation”.Another said “There is no way Kyedae and TenZ and Jason and Sakura broke up a day apart and it is not connected” Others simply shared shock over both relationships ending in the same week.In the middle of this John Choi also addressed rumors linking him to Kyedae. He asked people to stop cropping photos to push false narratives.For now the only confirmed news is simple. Sakura Shymko and Kyedae Shymko are sisters.

What’s happening: Gaming meets education in Saudi schools



Saudi Arabia taps into the global trend of gaming in classrooms



Level Up, Students! Saudi Arabia Adds Electronic Games to School Courses

What the gaming curriculum in Saudi Arabia will cover



Integration of gaming concepts into formal courses using electronic games to illustrate digital literacy, computer science fundamentals, teamwork and creative expression.

National level competitions designed to nurture talent and spotlight student achievements in game design and esports performance.

Professional pathways including training and qualification programs aligned with Saudi scholarship and vocational tracks like Khadem Al-Haramein Scholarship and Wa’ed, supporting future game designers and developers.

What comes next in Saudi Arabia’s gaming curriculum: Implementation and expansion



Saudi Arabia Rewrites School Rules: Electronic Gaming Is Now Officially ‘Educational’ as KSA Taps Into Global Trend





In a bold and unprecedented move, Saudi Arabia ’s Ministry of Education has officially approved the inclusion of electronic gaming, both competitive and educational aspects, in school curricula across all education levels. This landmark initiative aims to bridge traditional education with 21st-century digital skills, creativity and the rapidly growing gaming industry, reflecting a global shift toward recognising video games as valuable tools for learning and future careers.The decision comes after three strategic memorandums of understanding were signed between the Ministry of Education, the National Institute for Educational Development and the Educational Services Development Company with Savvy Games Group, a state-owned gaming enterprise under the Public Investment Fund. These agreements formalise the integration of electronic games into curricula, development of national gaming competitions and training pathways to build local talent within the gaming sector.Coverage from Al-Marsad newspaper reports that the collaboration will include working with the National Curriculum Center to embed game-related skills and knowledge in school content, alongside initiatives to upskill educators, create educational games and support nationwide innovation challenges tied to the gaming industry.This is one of the most significant educational policy shifts in the Middle East in recent years, not just because games are fun but because they can teach transferable and future-oriented skills. According to international research and global education commentary, competitive video gaming and esports programs in schools can nurture collaboration, strategic thinking, problem-solving, communication and leadership, all skills employers increasingly value.For example, schools in Wales and the US that implemented esports suites and gaming programs noted positive impacts on student engagement, teamwork and pathways into tech-related careers. Just as structured arts or sports programs can support growth, gaming education, when well designed, can be both academic and practical.Saudi Arabia’s move aligns with global experimentation around gaming as an educational tool. In Japan, certain schools have incorporated video games into classroom learning to help students build critical thinking and communication skills, with high participation and positive university progression rates among graduates.Likewise, academic discussion including research into game-based learning curricula such as Quest To Learn in the US, has highlighted how games can reinforce systems thinking and engagement, supporting traditional subjects like math, science and language through interactive design and strategic challenges. Saudi officials are positioning the gaming curriculum initiative as part of a larger push toward digital transformation, innovation and job creation in future industries.The Kingdom’s gaming sector already demonstrates strength, with millions of players and billions in annual revenue, signalling robust interest and economic potential. By formalising gaming education, authorities aim to prepare students for careers across game development, design, esports management, digital media, cybersecurity and related tech sectors. These are the fields that are poised for growth alongside Saudi Arabia’s broader economic diversification goals.While official details on the exact curriculum framework are still emerging, the memorandums outline several key components:The initiative is also expected to include the establishment of gaming labs and innovation hubs within technical and vocational institutions, geared toward hands-on experience and industry projects. Global education voices, including contributors to research platforms and the World Economic Forum , have explored how esports and gaming curricula can teach teamwork, leadership, problem solving and communication skills, especially when embedded within supportive academic structures.These programs often serve dual purposes: they enhance student engagement (particularly among learners who struggle with traditional teaching methods) and they create career pathways in technology, digital arts, programming and business.Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Education is now in the roll-out phase, working with curriculum developers, industry partners and training institutions to finalise content, teacher preparation and infrastructure. The early emphasis will likely be on pilot programs, teacher upskilling and integration phases to ensure the curriculum complements, rather than replaces, existing subject goals.Over time, the success of this gaming integration could attract attention from other countries in the region exploring innovative education models that respond to a rapidly evolving labour market and the rise of digital economies globally. With the official inclusion of electronic gaming in Saudi school curricula, the Kingdom is at the forefront of a global shift toward embracing games as tools for learning, creativity and future career readiness.While challenges remain, including ensuring balanced screen time and aligning gaming with core academic standards, the initiative signals a bold rethinking of how education can evolve to reflect the digital aspirations of a new generation of learners.","Saudi arabia integrates gaming into school curricula: a digital education revolution.

GCC's Digital Gold Rush: Are You Skilled Enough for 2026's Tech Takeover?

Soft skills: Leadership, communication and adaptability



Lifelong learning and reskilling mindset



Understanding localisation policies







As GCC economies accelerate towards digital-first, knowledge-driven growth, the skills that employers are looking for in 2026 have shifted dramatically. From Saudi Arabia ’s Vision 2030 projects to the UAE’s AI-led governance push, hiring priorities across the Gulf are increasingly shaped by technology adoption, sustainability goals and workforce localisation policies.Artificial Intelligence sits at the heart of GCC transformation strategies. According to the Hays GCC Salary Guide 2026 , digital and AI-driven roles are among the hardest to fill across the Middle East , with 90% of employers reporting skills shortages, particularly in advanced tech roles.Academic research supports this shift. A 2024 study published on arXiv , analysing millions of job listings, found that AI adoption increases demand not just for AI engineers but for AI-literate professionals across non-technical roles as well. The paper noted, “AI exposure is associated with higher demand for complementary skills such as analytical thinking, adaptability and collaboration.”In the GCC, AI skills are increasingly required in finance, healthcare, government services, logistics and media, not just tech firms.Data has become the backbone of decision-making in Gulf organisations. A landmark 2017 Strategy and PwC report on the GCC digital workforce found that while digital adoption is growing, advanced data skills remain scarce, limiting productivity gains.The report stated, “The shortage of advanced analytics and data science skills is one of the biggest barriers preventing GCC organisations from capturing full value from digital investments.” As governments and enterprises push for smart cities, fintech ecosystems and AI-powered public services, professionals skilled in data analysis, business intelligence and statistical modelling are becoming indispensable.With rapid digitisation comes increased cyber risk. While GCC-specific academic studies are limited, global labour research consistently ranks cybersecurity among the fastest-growing skills worldwide, a trend echoed in GCC hiring data.According to hiring outlooks cited by Khaleej Times and regional recruitment firms, cybersecurity specialists remain in high demand as governments and private firms strengthen digital infrastructureThese skills are especially relevant in banking, government, aviation and healthcare sectors across the GCC.Cloud expertise is now a foundational requirement rather than a niche skill. As per global hiring outlook reports AI, cloud and platform engineering roles dominate new job creation in global capability centres expanding operations linked to GCC markets.Cloud architects, DevOps engineers and platform specialists are especially valuable as Gulf companies migrate operations to scalable digital ecosystems.Despite the digital pivot, engineering and project management remain pillars of GCC employment, driven by infrastructure, energy and urban development megaprojects. According to regional hiring analyses cited by Khaleej Times, demand continues for professionals who can manage large-scale, multi-stakeholder projects, particularly those integrating digital and sustainability elementsProject managers with technical literacy, risk management skills and cross-cultural leadership ability are especially prized.Sustainability is no longer optional in the GCC. With the UAE and Saudi Arabia investing heavily in renewable energy, clean technology and climate initiatives, green skills are moving into the mainstream.A recent 2025 workforce analysis by PeopleConnect Global highlights rising demand for professionals skilled in sustainability reporting, renewable energy systems and environmental compliance across GCC markets.Roles linked to net-zero strategies, ESG compliance and sustainable infrastructure are expected to grow steadily through 2026.Multiple studies stress that human skills grow more valuable as automation increases. The same arXiv 2024 study on AI and labour markets found that AI-exposed roles show higher demand for teamwork, communication and resilience, not less.In the GCC, where teams are highly multicultural, employers increasingly value professionals who can lead diverse teams, communicate clearly and adapt to fast-changing environments.The 2027 Strategy& GCC digital workforce report emphasises that long-term employability depends not on one-time qualifications but on continuous upskilling. The report noted that economies that embed lifelong learning frameworks will be better positioned to meet future labour demands.This message is echoed in national workforce strategies across the Gulf.Understanding Emiratisation, Saudisation and national talent development policies is increasingly important. The Hays GCC Salary Guide 2026 highlights that localisation efforts are reshaping hiring strategies, particularly in leadership and specialist roles. Professionals who align their skills with these frameworks gain a competitive edge.Research across academia, recruitment and policy consistently point to one conclusion that GCC jobs in 2026 will reward hybrid professionals or those who combine digital fluency, analytical capability, adaptability and human-centric skills. From AI literacy to sustainability expertise, the most future-proof careers will belong to individuals who learn continuously, adapt quickly and align with the region’s transformation goals.","Top 2026 skills for gcc job market: ai, data, cybersecurity and more.

Canada, Greenland Show Of Power Amid Trump's ‘Invasion’ Storm; 'Difficult Times Are...'





The makers of mobile apps designed to help shoppers identify and boycott American goods say they saw a surge of interest in Denmark and beyond after the recent flare-up in tensions over U.S. President Donald Trump's designs on Greenland.The creator of the ""Made O'Meter"" app, Ian Rosenfeldt, said he saw around 30,000 downloads of the free app in just three days at the height of the trans-Atlantic diplomatic crisis in late January out of more than 100,000 since it was launched in March.Apps offer practical help Rosenfeldt, who lives in Copenhagen and works in digital marketing, decided to create the app a year ago after joining a Facebook group of like-minded Danes hoping to boycott U.S. goods.""Many people were frustrated and thinking, 'How do we actually do this in practical terms,'"" the 53-year-old recalled. ""If you use a bar code scanner, it's difficult to see if a product is actually American or not, if it's Danish or not. And if you don't know that, you can't really make a conscious choice.""The latest version of ""Made O'Meter"" uses artificial intelligence to identify and analyze several products at a time, then recommend similar European-made alternatives.Users can set preferences, like ""No USA-owned brands"" or ""Only EU-based brands."" The app claims over 95% accuracy.""By using artificial intelligence, you can take an image of a product ... and it can make a deep dive to go out and find the correct information about the product in many levels,"" Rosenfeldt told The Associated Press during a demonstration at a Copenhagen grocery store. ""This way, you have information that you can use to take decisions on what you think is right.""'Losing an ally' After an initial surge of downloads when the app was launched, usage tailed off. Until last month, when Trump stepped up his rhetoric about the need for the U.S. to acquire Greenland, a strategically important and mineral-rich Arctic island that is a semiautonomous territory of Denmark.Usage peaked Jan. 23, when there were almost 40,000 scans in one day, compared with 500 or so daily last summer. It has dropped back since but there were still around 5,000 a day this week, said Rosenfeldt, who noted ""Made O'Meter"" is used by over 20,000 people in Denmark but also by people in Germany, Spain, Italy, even Venezuela.""It's become much more personal,"" said Rosenfeldt, who spoke of ""losing an ally and a friend.""Trump announced in January he would slap new tariffs on Denmark and seven other European countries that opposed his takeover calls, only to abruptly drop his threats after he said a ""framework"" for a deal over access to mineral-rich Greenland was reached with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte's help. Few details of that agreement have emerged.The U.S. began technical talks in late January to put together an Arctic security deal with Denmark and Greenland, which say sovereignty is not negotiable.Rosenfeldt knows such boycotts won't damage the U.S. economy, but hopes to send a message to supermarkets and encourage greater reliance on European producers.""Maybe we can send a signal and people will listen and we can make a change,"" he added.The protest may be largely symbolic Another Danish app, ""NonUSA,"" topped 100,000 downloads at the beginning of February. One of its creators, 21-year-old Jonas Pipper, said there were over 25,000 downloads Jan. 21, when 526 product scans were performed in a minute at one point. Of the users, some 46,000 are in Denmark and around 10,000 in Germany.""We noticed some users saying they felt like a little bit of the pressure was lifted off them,"" Pipper said. ""They feel like they kind of gained the power back in this situation.""It's questionable whether such apps will have much practical effect.Christina Gravert, an associate professor of economics at the University of Copenhagen, said there are actually few U.S. products on Danish grocery store shelves, ""around 1 to 3%"". Nuts, wines and candy, for example. But there is widespread use of American technology in Denmark, from Apple iPhones to Microsoft Office tools.""If you really want to have an impact, that's where you should start,"" she said.Even ""Made O'Meter"" and ""NonUSA"" are downloaded from Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store.Gravert, who specializes in behavioral economics, said such boycott campaigns are usually short-lived and real change often requires an organized effort rather than individual consumers.""It can be interesting for big supermarket brands to say, OK, we're not going to carry these products anymore because consumers don't want to buy them,"" she said. ""If you think about large companies, this might have some type of impact on the import (they) do.""On a recent morning, shoppers leaving one Copenhagen grocery store were divided.""We do boycott, but we don't know all the American goods. So, it's mostly the well-known trademarks,"" said Morten Nielsen, 68, a retired navy officer. ""It's a personal feeling ... we feel we do something, I know we are not doing very much.""""I love America, I love traveling in America,"" said 63-year-old retiree Charlotte Fuglsang. ""I don't think we should protest that way.""","""made o'meter"" uses artificial intelligence to identify and analyze several products at a time. Users can set preferences, like ""no usa-owned brands"" or ""only eu-based brands"" another danish app, ""nonusa,"" topped 100,000 downloads at the beginning of february.

Industry operations exposed

Supply chain mechanics

Failed crackdowns





A man, while surfing his regular channel for adult content, found himself on the website. On screen, he saw the quality time he had spent with his girlfriend in a hotel in China's Shenzhen three weeks ago.This incident sparked an investigation into China's spy-cam porn industry, exposing how the genre, heavily fueled by the voyeuristic audience, has been operating a sophisticated network of hidden cameras, livestreams, and paid subscriptions that exploit hotel guests nationwide.A report by BBC World Service found evidence of a structured industry involving multiple actors, including installers, “camera owners”, agents, and online distributors. The content is promoted on Telegram, a channel banned in China, while higher-level operators reportedly manage camera installations and streaming infrastructure.One of the Telegram channels, managed by an agent named 'AKA' had up to 10,000 members and was promoting access to over 180 hotel-room spy-cams livestreaming intimate moments to paying consumers for fees of around 450 Yuan monthly.Subscribers were able to select from multiple feeds, which are triggered immediately after the hotel guests put their key cards in.The website also had the options to rewind footage, download clips from the archives and a chatroom.In a period of seven months, 54 cameras were identified (half active), potentially capturing thousands of unaware guests based on occupancy rates.Operators install miniature hidden cameras, sometimes as small as a pencil eraser, inside hotel fixtures such as ventilation units, wiring them directly into the building’s power supply. The agents operate as intermediaries for “camera owners”, who are believed to oversee both the physical installation of devices and the running of the online platforms.Platform archives examined in the probe contained more than 6,000 edited clips dating back to 2017, and when one camera in a Zhengzhou hotel was discovered and removed, a replacement feed was activated within hours.Although regulations introduced in April 2025 require hotels to conduct routine inspections for hidden cameras, investigators were still able to identify thousands of newly uploaded videos on six different platforms over an 18‑month period.Law enforcement cases appear scattered across multiple provinces, but experts say the sustained demand for “raw”, non-consensual footage continues to drive the market, and tests show that many commercially available camera detectors fail to identify professionally concealed devices.","Investigation into china's spy-cam porn industry exposes sophisticated network of hidden cameras, livestreams, and paid subscriptions. 54 cameras were identified (half active), potentially capturing thousands of unaware guests based on occupancy rates.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128024592,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1235780,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

His persistence paid off massively: ‘FA9LA’ (which means “vibe” or “party” in Bahraini dialect) actually set a Guinness World Record by topping four Billboard Arabia charts simultaneously.Before conquering India, he was already collaborating with icons like Shaggy and The Game.Now, he’s coming to India to bridge the gap between Middle Eastern and Desi hip-hop, proving that a great beat needs no translation.While Flipperachi has been a legend in the Gulf for two decades, he truly ""arrived"" in India through the 2025 blockbuster film Dhurandhar.The track ‘FA9LA’ (pronounced) was used as the bone-chilling, high-octane entry theme for Akshaye Khanna’s character, Rehman Dakait.The combination of Khanna's swagger and the track's pounding rhythm, which subtly blends Arabic hip-hop with Indian tabla percussion, created a cultural crossover moment unlike any other. Despite the Arabic lyrics, the song's energy transcended language, fueling over 10 million social media clips and helping the film cross the ₹450 crore mark at the box office.Flipperachi is now bringing his global rap energy to India with his first live performance, thrilling fans who discovered him through the Dhurandhar craze.Confirmed details:The concerts are being produced by major promoters, including Eva Live and Zee Live, powered by Mastercard, highlighting the confidence in his India crossover appeal.If you think the song hits hard on a 6-inch phone screen, wait until you feel the bass through a professional stadium rig.

Think massive LED screens, synced light shows, and high-energy visuals that reflect the gritty, urban spirit of his music.Whether you’re a die-hard hip-hop head or just someone who can’t get that Dhurandhar beat out of your head, this is the one show you cannot afford to miss.

Why retailers made this move?

Broader context





Grocery bills in the UAE are about to feel lighter. Thousands of everyday essentials, from rice and dairy to cleaning products and frozen foods, are undergoing permanent price reductions as part of a large-scale retail reset across stores nationwide.Unlike short-term promotions, these reductions are being positioned as long-term pricing changes. Retail executives say the aim is to establish “everyday lower pricing” rather than temporary discount campaigns, giving residents predictable savings on weekly shopping.The move comes at a time when many households are closely monitoring budgets, especially ahead of Ramadan, when grocery spending traditionally rises.Choithrams, one of the UAE’s oldest and most trusted supermarket chains, has unveiled a major strategic price reset on thousands of everyday products, affecting both in-store and online shopping. The new pricing initiative, described by the company as permanent, not promotional, will apply to around 10,000 essential items, making it one of the largest price overhauls by a UAE retailer in recent memory.Mark Mortimer-Davies, chief executive officer of Choithrams, confirmed that these price adjustments are not short-term offers but will be locked “for the long term” as the supermarket’s new everyday standard for customers across the Emirates.”\Choithrams says the price reset will be rolled out in three phases during the first half of the year. The first phase alone covers about 3,500 products, and is expected to return an estimated AED 13 million in savings to shoppers in this round.On average, prices have been cut by roughly 15 percent across the affected items, spanning essential grocery staples, fresh produce, and everyday non-food products.While food prices saw a solid double-digit drop, household cleaning and non-food essentials have been cut even further, some by over 20%.Choithrams’ pricing reset follows a 2025 customer survey of nearly 8,000 shoppers that highlighted two main insights: consumers trust Choithrams, but they also want greater everyday value.Dinesh Pagarani, director at Choithrams, said the company recognises that many households face budgeting challenges, particularly in the run-up to Ramadan, and the new pricing strategy is meant to help customers plan their weekly shopping with confidence.Choithrams emphasises that this reset is a structural shift rather than a one-off discount campaign. The aim is to establish predictable, consistently low prices that align with other major retailers while preserving quality and choice.This initiative comes amid broader efforts in the UAE to manage consumer prices and protect household spending power. The UAE Ministry of Economy has recently introduced tools such as a national digital price-monitoring platform to track essential commodity prices in real time, helping ensure stable and fair market pricing.This regulatory backdrop reflects the UAE’s wider objective to promote market transparency, inflation control, and consumer protection, particularly for essentials like rice, eggs, dairy, sugar and more.Across the retail sector, other supermarkets have also taken steps in past years to lock or limit the prices of key products, such as Carrefour’s price-freeze campaigns on everyday goods in previous seasons.","Uae’s choithrams announces permanent price cuts on thousands of groceries and essentials.

Big relief for UAE OFWs: Department of Migrant Workers rolls out new digital reforms for faster services,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/big-relief-for-uae-ofws-department-of-migrant-workers-rolls-out-new-digital-reforms-for-faster-services/articleshow/128193121.cms,"DMW Digital Reforms: Faster Services for OFWs in UAE and Globally

What the DMW changes entail



Streamlining travel and travel clearance



Decentralisation and enforcement enhancements



No More Long Queues? Philippines Fast-Tracks OFW Services with Major Digital Overhaul

Why this matters for OFWs and families



OFWs in the UAE to Benefit as Manila Speeds Up Government Services

How the reforms could evolve



Challenges and the road ahead







The Department of Migrant Workers (DMW) in the Philippines has unveiled a sweeping set of digital reforms aimed at speeding up services for Overseas Filipino Workers (OFWs), including those in key destinations like the United Arab Emirates, as part of a broader effort to modernise support, reduce bureaucratic delays and protect migrant rights. The move, announced during the DMW’s Central Office–Regional Office Consultation 2026, reflects the government’s commitment to efficient, responsive services for millions of overseas workers who are vital to the nation’s economy and families.DMW Secretary Hans Cacdac said the reforms will cut queues, streamline procedures and align overseas services with domestic operations through a Regional Operations Manual that standardises practices across offices. The department also plans to adopt a Quality Management System (QMS), upgrade facilities to global standards, and accelerate digital initiatives such as the OFW Pass, while reducing face-to-face requirements for issuing the OFW Information Sheet, an essential document for overseas workers.In practical terms, these changes aim to decrease foot traffic and bureaucracy, ensuring that OFWs no longer spend hours waiting for basic services.This is especially significant in countries where many Filipino workers have limited time to handle official transactions because of demanding work schedules and travel constraints.Part of this overhaul intersects with efforts to modernise travel documentation for OFWs. Recent developments reported in travel and government digitalisation news show that the Overseas Employment Certificate (OEC), a mandatory exit clearance for Filipino workers, is being phased into a unified OFW Travel Pass via the eGovPH app, allowing workers to process travel clearances digitally without printing or visiting offices.For OFWs in the UAE and other Gulf countries, this integration promises a major reduction in time-consuming bureaucracy, enabling them to complete travel and clearance processes from remote locations, including smartphones or computers.The new reforms are not just about convenience; they also extend to strengthening enforcement against illegal recruitment, a perennial risk for migrant workers. The DMW is devolving key functions such as case adjudication, inspections and coordinated enforcement operations to regional offices, including partnerships with law enforcement and local governments.This approach could mean quicker action on complaints, improved protection for aspiring OFWs who face exploitation at recruitment stages and a more accessible complaints process for workers abroad. Given that many OFWs in the UAE and across the Middle East work through agencies, faster enforcement can be a crucial safeguard for labour rights and contract fairness.The DMW’s reform push sits within a broader global trend toward digital transformation in public services. Governments worldwide are accelerating digitalisation to improve accessibility, cut delays and reduce paperwork, particularly for services involving large mobile populations.For example, in the UAE, federal digital initiatives like the Zero Government Bureaucracy Programme have led to dramatic efficiency gains such as cutting labour document requirements by up to 95% and accelerating work permit and residency services via integrated platforms under MoHRE’s smart services agenda.These systems leverage AI and digital integration to shorten procedures and expand 24/7 access to services online. While the UAE’s initiatives focus on labour market efficiency within the country, the Philippines’ DMW reforms aim to make life easier for citizens living and working abroad, especially in countries with advanced digital service ecosystems like the UAE.OFWs are a cornerstone of the Philippine economy, with remittances contributing significantly to national income and local household support. Streamlined digital services can have a tangible impact on their lives by reducing time spent on bureaucratic processes and freeing up more time for work and family commitments, enhancing the safety net by enabling faster legal and administrative support when issues arise abroad, improving mobility and travel efficiency through integrated digital travel documents and clearance systems and lowering administrative costs and stress for workers and their families.For UAE-based OFWs, numbering among the largest Filipino expatriate communities worldwide, such digital advances can mean more seamless interactions with Philippine government systems even while they are overseas, aligning services with global expectations for digital governance.Officials also discussed budget planning and project management practices for 2026, indicating that digital systems development will continue to be prioritised. The aim is to ensure sustained investment in technology, capacity building and infrastructure that underpin efficient migrant worker services.Beyond the current initiatives, there is potential for expanded partnerships and services for instance, online contract verification systems and unified mobile platforms, that further reduce the need for in-person visits at overseas offices, such as those in Dubai and Abu Dhabi already piloting digital verification technologies.While digital reforms promise convenience, they also require digital literacy and access, especially for older workers or those in regions with limited internet availability. The DMW’s success will depend on effective communication, training and support for OFWs to fully use new digital tools.Furthermore, integration across government systems, both in the Philippines and in host countries like the UAE, involves data security and privacy considerations, which authorities must address to ensure trust and reliability in the new systems. The DMW’s fast-tracking of services through digital reform represents a major advance for Overseas Filipino Workers, reducing bureaucratic hurdles and aligning services with modern digital expectations.By integrating travel documentation, decentralising key functions and prioritising technology upgrades, the Philippines is aiming to make migrant services faster, more accessible and more protective for OFWs, especially in diaspora-heavy regions like the Middle East. As these reforms unfold, they could set a new standard in how countries support and empower their citizens working abroad, blending efficiency with compassionate governance in the digital age.","The department of migrant workers (dmw) in the philippines has unveiled a sweeping set of digital reforms aimed at speeding up services for overseas filipino workers.

'Trying to isolate over 100 million users': Russia blocks WhatsApp — will the ban be reversed?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/trying-to-isolate-over-100-million-users-russia-blocks-whatsapp-will-the-ban-be-reversed/articleshow/128235081.cms,"



Russia on Tuesday attempted to block social media platform WhatsApp and Telegram to promote its home-grown platforms and seek greater control over its internet space.In a statement, WhatsApp said that the move will isolate over 100 million users, claiming that the step can ""only lead to less safety for people.""""Today the Russian government attempted to fully block WhatsApp in an effort to drive people to a state-owned surveillance app. Trying to isolate over 100 million users from private and secure communication is a backwards step and can only lead to less safety for people in Russia,"" WhatsApp said in a post on X.""We continue to do everything we can to keep users connected,"" it added.Meanwhile, Telegram founder said that the ""authoritarian move"" won't the company's course.""Russia is restricting access to Telegram to force its citizens onto a state-controlled app built for surveillance and political censorship. This authoritarian move won’t change our course,"" Pavel Durov said.""Telegram stands for freedom and privacy, no matter the pressure,"" he added.This comes after foreign tech providers and Moscow landed in a dispute following the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. Russian authorities are pushing a state-backed rival app called 'MAX', which critics claim could be used to track users.However, state media have dismissed those accusations as false.When asked if WhatsApp would return to Russia, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov said, ""This is again a question of fulfilling the legislation. If the Meta corporation fulfils this and enters into dialogue with Russian authorities, then we have the possibility of reaching an agreement.""""If the corporation (Meta) sticks to an uncompromising position and, I would say, shows itself unready to align with Russian legislation, then there is no chance,"" he told TASS in a video published by the state news agency on Wednesday.Last year, Russia began limiting some calls on WhatsApp and messaging service Telegram, accusing foreign-owned platforms of refusing to share information with law enforcement in fraud and terrorism cases. It also blocked Apple’s video-calling app FaceTime in December.Telegram's Russian-born founder Pavel Durov previously said it would remain committed to protecting freedom of speech and user privacy.","Russia attempted to block social media platforms whatsapp and telegram on tuesday.
