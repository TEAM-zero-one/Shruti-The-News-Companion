"Conflict to closet, Operation Sindoor sparks boom in patriotic merch",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/conflict-to-closet-operation-sindoor-sparks-boom-in-patriotic-merch/articleshow/121198842.cms,"Operation Sindoor

After two sharp oneliners by Air Marshal A K Bharti lit up social media following the May 10 India-Pakistan ceasefire, Adi Arora, a 34-year-old entrepreneur based in Parwanoo, Himachal Pradesh, quickly turned them into T-shirts. One bears director general air operations Bharti’s now-iconic line, “Our job is to hit the target, not to count the body bags.”Another reads, “I don’t know what’s there in Kirana Hills,” Bharti’s deadpan reply to whether the Air Force had struck Pakistan’s nuclear site. A third design — now a bestseller — has the emblems of the armed forces with the tagline ‘ Operation Sindoor ’ on Arora’s company Kadak Merch ’s website.Operation Sindoor not only marked a bold shift in India’s counter-terrorism stance, it also led to a surge in commerce with many keen to wear patriotism on their sleeve. Or carry it on their arm in the form of tote bags. TOI reported that even sales of sindoor powder surged in Bhubaneswar. There was even a controversial trademark registration of Operation Sindoor but a PIL has been ﬁled against it.For Prasad Narayan Kamkar, a handloom cotton saree wholesaler from Belagavi, Karnataka, this offered an unexpected ‘rebranding’ opportunity. His stock of unsold red and maroon sarees is now being sold as ‘Sindoor sarees’. “What else can I do? Ever since the war broke out, my market has been bad. My shopkeeper clients in Jodhpur and Udaipur, near the border areas, were not taking orders or responding to my calls,” says Kamkar, whose sindoor range of sarees featured in local news as well. “Now, there are new sindoor sarees in check patterns in production,” he adds.Anish Agarwal, commercial pilot and founder of Kolkatabased Aero Armour which has been selling military-inspired apparel for the last ﬁve years, has gone a step further with his Sindoor T-shirts. “On the tees, we have mapped the sites where India struck,” he says. The brand has previously created collections around defence operations such as Kargil, Meghdoot and Black Tornado. Aero Armour’s ﬂagship Kargil Collection is even sold at the Kargil War Memorial in Drass.Upcoming designs for its Operation Sindoor collection will include aerial views of the strike zones and illustrations of defence equipment like the BrahMos missile and Rafale jet, alongside video podcasts with ex-servicemen on Instagram. “We will map Pakistan’s terror HQs like Bahawalpur and Muridke,” says Agarwal. But isn’t this using patriotic fervor for proﬁt? “Yes, we are criticised occasionally. But the forces themselves have appreciated our work. That matters more.”Arora from Kadak Merch insists he is not doing this to monetise war. “I believe merchandise is the best way for civilians to support the armed forces. We want to continue this and build a fund to donate to the Indian armed forces ,” he says. Kadak Merch’s Operation Sindoor range — designed in under an hour on May 12— is selling fast, he claims. “I have already sold more than 1,000 units. Orders are coming from all over India,” says Arora, whose company usually riffs on memes and pop culture trends for its merch.Ad guru Piyush Pandey says brands selling merchandise under names like Operation Sindoor is insensitive. “At the end of the day, however successful we were, we also lost people — ﬁrst in Pahalgam, and even after that. Don’t turn it into a business,” Pandey adds.Navin Israni of Mansa Sarees in Kolkata’s New Market area had a change of heart and withdraw his special edition crepe saree featuring the phrase ‘Mera Bharat Mahan’ in 21 Indian languages, with motifs like the Ashoka Chakra, Tricolour and peacock printed. “We had made 50 pieces for sale, but there were second thoughts in the family. Some pointed out, ‘Our army men are out there sacriﬁcing their lives, and you want to mint money out of it?’ That hit home,” says Israni, who has decided to donate the sarees instead.","Ad guru piyush pandey says brands selling merchandise under names like operation sindoor is insensitive. “at the end of the day, however successful we were, we also lost people — ﬁrst in pahalgam, and even even in bhubaneswar,” he says.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121198849,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-18918,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

HYDERABAD: It's not just the country's western border that took heavy enemy fire during Operation Sindoor . India was attacked in cyberspace, too, by state-backed hackers and hacktivists from Pakistan, Turkiye, Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Indonesia, with backing from China, according to cybersecurity experts.Apart from defence PSUs and their MSME vendors, critical infrastructure like ports, airports, power grids, transportation services like Indian Railways and airlines, telecom players like BSNL, fintech platforms like UPI, digital wallets, stock exchanges, and major Indian conglomerates with investments in infrastructure too came under attack, sources said. The attempt was to both embarrass India and also extract sensitive information about its defence systems, including its missiles, they said.According to Interpol trainer and cyber forensic expert Pendyala Krishna Shastry, the attacks were part of a broader campaign waged by Pakistani actors against Indian digital assets. These groups reportedly deployed malware, conducted phishing attacks, and launched denial-of-service operations targeting critical sectors such as finance, telecom, energy, and public services.Zone-H, a website that tracks defacements, reported incidents involving Indian govt domains. The website of National Institute of Water Sports (niws.nic.in) was claimed to have been defaced. Another, nationaltrust.nic.in, also experienced a breach, but was restored later.The Central Coalfields Ltd (CCL) website suffered a major technical glitch on Tuesday after a message appeared from one Mr Habib 404.

Make iPhones in US instead of India: Trump to Apple CEO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/make-iphones-in-us-instead-of-india-trump-to-apple-ceo/articleshow/121196807.cms,"Donald Trump

‘Trump’s tariff remarks may be a negotiating tactic by White House’

US President Donald Trump on Thursday said he has asked Apple CEO Tim Cook to stop producing iPhones in India, and make them in the US instead.Apple has no smartphone production in the US — most of its iPhones are made in China while facilities in India produce around 40 million units per year (about 15% of Apple’s annual output). Cook had previously stated that Apple will source the majority of iPhones sold in the US from India in the June quarter while China will produce the vast majority of the devices for other markets.Speaking on Thursday at an event with business bigwigs in Doha, Trump also said India had “offered us a deal where basically they are willing to literally charge us no tariff” on US goods.Trump didn’t provide further details of the apparent offer, nor was there any comment from Indian officials. Trump’s comments came days after India threatened to impose retaliatory tariffs in response to higher US duties on steel and aluminium.Some analysts in New Delhi suggested that President Trump’s remarks could indicate either that India is close to finalising a deal, or that the comments are a negotiating tactic by the White House.While PM Modi and Trump share a strong personal rapport, there is growing frustration in New Delhi in recent days over the US president’s insistence he used trade as a bargaining tool to secure a ceasefire between India and Pakistan. Indian officials have disputed that.Talking about his conversation with Tim Cook, Trump said, “I had a little problem with Tim Cook yesterday. I said to him, ‘Tim, you’re my friend. I treated you very well. You’re coming in with $500 billion (investment). But now I hear you're building all over India. I don't want you building in India.”The company had earlier this year pledged to spend $500 billion in the US over the next four years.As a result of discussions with Cook, Trump said Apple will be “upping their production in the United States”.Cheaper skilled labour and availability of precision-engineered product supply chains have driven Apple to China and India for manufacturing iPhones. American labour and manufacturing in comparison is expensive.Trump suggested that Apple could make its products in India for the Indian market. But made-in-India iPhones being sold in the US has to stop. “You can build in India if you want, to take care of India,” Trump said he told Cook.According to an analysis by S&P Global, iPhone sales in the US were 75.9 million units in 2024, with exports in March from India at 3.1 million units.The Apple ecosystem in India is one the biggest job creators in the country. It is estimated to have employed around two lakh people across various vendors in the country.Since returning to the White House, Trump has pledged to impose “reciprocal” tariffs of 26% on India. Those tariffs are currently on hold until early July.India has made several moves to satisfy Trump’s grievances this year, including overhauling its tariff regime to reduce import duties on prominent American goods like bourbon whiskey and high-end motorcycles made by Harley-Davidson Inc. As part of its trade negotiations, New Delhi has also proposed zero tariffs on some goods like auto components and pharmaceuticals on a reciprocal basis up to a certain quantity of imports.","Us president donald trump said he has asked apple ceo tim cook to stop producing iphones in india, and make them in the us instead.

"Steam Data Leaked: 89 million Steam account details may be stolen as hackers list them for sale, report claims",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/gaming/89-million-steam-account-details-may-be-stolen-as-hackers-list-them-for-sale-report-claims/articleshow/121166794.cms,"“Yesterday, an alleged major @Steam data breach occurred, compromising over 89 million user records (roughly two-thirds of all Steam accounts). These datasets are being sold for over $5,000 on what appears to be a site akin to Mipped.

Mipped alongside their sister sites is a forum site we at @SteamSentinels have warned Steam about for years for instances of developer blackmailing, review manipulation, greenlight boosting, and other dodgy activities, but as of yet, Steam hasn't tried to take action against the site.

https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/shady-russian-market-for-asset-flip-games-uncovered

https://steamcommunity.com/groups/Sentinels_of_the_Store/announcements/detail/4222762959836264571

This inaction has ultimately led to the selling of tens of millions of user account details.

✅ Enable two-factor authentication

✅ Monitor your email for suspicious activity

✅ Change your Steam password (and others, if reused)

✅ Beware of phishing attempts disguised as game promotions or support messages

✅ Join Sentinels of the Store to stay in the know!”

“An update suggests that the alleged Steam data breach is not a direct breach of Steam itself, but rather a supply chain compromise — meaning an external service that Steam relies on was targeted.

Here's what we understand from this update:

New evidence confirms some real data is involved: A sample of the leaked data includes real-time SMS logs, which are used in two-factor authentication (2FA).

Twilio is the vendor named: Twilio is a company that provides communication services, like sending 2FA codes via SMS. Steam uses (or used) Twilio for this.

Leaked info includes:

Message contents (e.g., the 2FA codes)

Delivery status (e.g., sent, delivered, failed)

Metadata (timestamps, recipient numbers, etc.)

Routing costs (how much it costs to send each message)

The implication means that the alleged Mipped seller has backend access to Twilio: The nature of the data suggests the attackers had access to Twilio's systems, likely through a compromised Twilio user account or API key or direct access to Twilio's backend dashboard.

Not a direct hack of Steam itself: Steam’s internal servers or databases don’t appear to be breached. But because they rely on Twilio for sending 2FA codes, this affects their users too.

Why it’s dangerous:

Phishing: Hackers could use the info to send fake but convincing messages to users.

Session hijacking: If attackers can intercept or replay 2FA codes, they might bypass login protection.”

Steam users are being advised to consider changing their passwords. A report has indicated that hackers may have leaked the details of 89 million Steam accounts, which are now up for sale on the dark web. If this report is accurate, a large number of user accounts could be at risk. Compromised accounts may even lead to users losing access to their collection of PC games. The information about the potential sale comes from a LinkedIn post by Underdark AI. Underdark AI referenced a post on a black market forum by a user named Machine1337. This post is allegedly offering 89 million Steam account details for $5,000. If these details are obtained, accounts without two-factor authentication or those with unchanged passwords could be accessed. Additionally, the information could be used to send phishing messages. The potential situation was noted in a post shared on the social media platform X (earlier Twitter) by the user MellowOnline1.In the X post, the user shared details about the alleged Steam data breach and advised users on how to keep their accounts safe. The user wrote:In the same thread, the user also noted:","A report indicates that hackers may have leaked the details of 89 million steam accounts, which are now up for sale on the dark web.

Microsoft has introduced new rehire ban and performance management overhaul



Managment roles are being cut across the industry as tech giants push for efficiency

Microsoft has announced that it will lay off 3% of its global workforce, affecting thousands of employees across all levels, teams, and geographies, amounting to over 6,000 employees. The cuts at the Redmond giant, which employed 228,000 people as of last June, aim to reduce management layers and streamline operations.""We continue to implement organisational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace,"" a Microsoft spokesperson told CNBC in a statement.The latest round of job cuts Microsoft's largest reduction since eliminating 10,000 roles in 2023. Unlike January's smaller performance-based cuts, the company indicated these layoffs are structural in nature.These cuts may particularly impact the middle management roles, as the company seeks to create a more streamlined hierarchy by increasing each manager's ""span of control."" Microsoft, as reported by Business Insider previously, aims to prioritise engineering talent as it continues investing heavily in artificial intelligence initiatives.Sources told Business Insider that the laid off employees will stay on the payroll for the 60 days after their termination. Further, the affected staff will also be reportedly eligible for rewards and bonuses.The workforce reduction comes amid significant changes to Microsoft's performance management system. According to internal documents viewed by Business Insider, the company has implemented a two-year rehire ban for employees forced out due to performance issues.Microsoft has also introduced a ""good attrition"" metric to track desirable employee departures. This approach mirrors Amazon's controversial ""unregretted attrition"" system and signals Microsoft's intent to more aggressively manage underperforming staff.Under the new system, employees facing performance issues must either enter a performance improvement plan (PIP) with ""clear expectations and a timeline for improvement"" or accept a ""Global Voluntary Separation Agreement"" with 16 weeks of severance pay. Those who choose the PIP path have just five days to decide and will no longer be eligible for the severance package if they opt for the improvement plan.Microsoft's restructuring reflects a broader trend across the tech industry toward flatter organizational structures and higher engineering efficiency. The company is reportedly focusing on reducing its ""PM ratio,"" the proportion of managers to engineers, across teams.Similar strategies have been implemented at other tech giants, including Amazon and Google, where the top layer of the hierarchy were let go. Meta is also expected to let go off several thousand employees this year, as CEO Mark Zuckerberg pushes for a “year of efficiency.”The layoffs follow Microsoft's better-than-expected quarterly results reported in April, when CEO Satya Nadella indicated the company would make sales execution changes after lower-than-expected growth in non-AI Azure cloud revenue.",Layoffs to impact management staff; coders and engineering employees may stay safe.

Dialga, the Temporal Pokemon, is a legendary Steel/Dragon-type renowned for its versatility in both Player versus Environment (PvE) and Player versus Player (PvP) battles. Its moveset optimization depends heavily on battle type and role, with distinct strategies for raids, gyms, and competitive leagues. Below is a detailed breakdown of its top movesets, alternatives, and supporting stats.- Fast Move: Dragon Breath (14.4 DPS, 8 EPS)- Charged Move: Draco Meteor (51.4 DPS, 1.50 DPE)This combination maximizes Dragon-type damage output, leveraging Same-Type Attack Bonus (STAB) for 20% increased damage. Draco Meteor’s 150 base power makes it ideal for burst damage in raids, though its one-bar energy cost requires strategic timing.- Fast Move: Metal Claw (14.4 DPS, 10 EPS)- Charged Move: Iron Head (36 DPS, 1.20 DPE)While less potent than Dragon sets, this setup provides Steel-type coverage against Fairy or Ice opponents. Metal Claw’s higher energy generation balances Iron Head’s two-bar efficiency.- Fast Move: Dragon Breath- Charged Move: Roar of Time (Signature Move)Roar of Time, a two-bar Dragon move, offers comparable power to Draco Meteor with faster energy regeneration, making Origin Forme Dialga a top-tier raid attacker.- Fast Move: Dragon Breath (4.0 DPT, 3.0 EPT)- Charged Moves: Iron Head (60 power, 45 energy) + Draco Meteor (150 power, 65 energy)Dragon Breath’s high energy generation pairs with Iron Head’s low cost for consistent pressure. Draco Meteor serves as a closing nuke, though its self-debuff risk demands careful use.- Charged Moves: Iron Head + Thunder (100 power, 60 energy)Thunder sacrifices raw power for broader coverage, countering Water-types like Kyogre and Flying-types such as Yveltal.- Type Weaknesses: Dialga is vulnerable to Fighting (Lucario) and Ground (Groudon) attackers. Avoid matchups with these types.- Energy Efficiency: Iron Head’s 45-energy cost allows quicker activation than Draco Meteor (65 energy), critical for shield baiting in PvP.- STAB Synergy: Dragon Breath and Metal Claw both benefit from STAB, but Dragon’s offensive utility outweighs Steel’s in most scenarios.Also read: Pokemon GO Uxie, Mesprit, and Azelf raid guide: Best counters, weaknesses, catch CPs, best tips, and more Dialga’s adaptability across battle formats cements its status as a meta-defining Pokemon.

TikTok trends





The EU accused TikTok on Thursday of breaking digital rules after concluding that the Chinese-owned social media platform is not transparent enough about advertisements.The European Commission ""found that TikTok does not provide the necessary information about the content of the advertisements, the users targeted by the ads, and who paid for the advertisements"", it said in a statement.It is the first time Brussels has formally accused TikTok with breaching the Digital Services Act (DSA), the EU's landmark online content law.""In our preliminary view, TikTok is not complying with the DSA in key areas of its advertisement repository, preventing the full inspection of the risks brought about by its advertising and targeting systems,"" the EU's digital chief, Henna Virkkunen, said.Under the DSA, the world's largest digital companies must establish an advertisement library that shows information about the adverts that run on their platforms.The EU hopes that any ads library is then easily accessible to researchers and civil society to detect scam adverts and hybrid threat campaigns.The DSA, which entered into effect last year, is part of the European Union 's powerful armoury to rein in big tech, and gives the EU the power to hit companies with fines as high as six percent of their global annual revenues.TikTok is still under investigation in the same probe launched in February 2024 amid fears it may not be doing enough to address negative impacts on young people.A key worry is the so-called ""rabbit hole"" effect, which occurs when users are fed related content based on an algorithm, in some cases leading to more dangerous content.TikTok now has the right to examine the commission's documents and reply in writing.The EU launched investigations last year into claims it was used by Russia to sway the result of Romania's presidential election and over its Lite spinoff app.The company backed down and permanently removed a feature in the Lite app in France and Spain in August after regulators warned it could be very addictive.EU states including Belgium and France also recently raised concerns with the EU over the ""SkinnyTok"" trend promoting extreme thinness on TikTok.TikTok has said it does not allow the display or promotion of dangerous behaviours related to eating habits and weight loss.The DSA has more stringent rules for the biggest platforms, and demands tech giants do more to counter the spread of illegal and harmful content as well as disinformation.The EU last year accused X, owned by US tech billionaire Elon Musk, of breaching the DSA over its blue checkmarks for certified accounts.And as part of a wide-ranging probe, the EU is looking into the spread of illegal content and the effectiveness of the platform's efforts to combat disinformation.","Eu accuses tiktok of violating digital rules over ads.

Poll Do you believe social media platforms are doing enough to combat hate speech? Yes, they are taking sufficient action No, more needs to be done

Nazi symbols prohibited in Germany

Nazi symbols not banned in the US

Lack of tech company regulation





Despite being banned on most social media platforms, a provocative new single by Ye, the rapper also known as Kanye West , remains on Elon Musk 's X platform, where it has millions of views.Ye's latest track references the words of the Nazi salute ""Heil Hitler "" (""Hail Hitler""), which was used while Adolf Hitler was in power. The single's artwork resembles a swastika and the song ends with a lengthy sample from a Hitler speech.West has been blocked multiple times from X for antisemitic content, and recently lost his Yeezy-brand contract with Adidas after posting a series of antisemitic rants.Quickly after its release, platforms including Spotify, YouTube and Soundcloud worked to ban the single due to its antisemitic content. Although the video appears to not to have been uploaded by the artist to other platforms, his celebrity status has meant the video has been sampled and shared by users on Facebook, Instagram and Reddit, among other platforms, millions of times.It shows just how little power big tech companies seem to have — or want to put into removing offensive content once it's already been published.From Germany, Ye's video cannot be directly seen on his X profile, even though the posts were still available on May 13 (changing one's location to the USA with a VPN, for example, makes the posts visible again).The salute ""Heil Hitler"" was used as an official greeting in Nazi Germany. The accompanying arm movement, which is made with the right arm extended and the palm facing down, is said to have its origins in ancient Rome and was then adopted by fascist dictator Benito Mussolini in the 1920s.Later, Hitler made it a signature of the Nazi Party, which ruled Germany from 1933 until 1945.Despite being banned on most social media platforms, a provocative new single by Ye, the rapper also known as Kanye West, remains on Elon Musk's X platform, where it has millions of views.Ye's latest track references the words of the Nazi salute ""Heil Hitler"" (""Hail Hitler""), which was used while Adolf Hitler was in power.

In February, Australia passed an anti-hate crime law that includes minimum sentences for displaying hate symbols, including the Nazi salute.Meanwhile, in the US, freedom of speech is heavily protected by the US Constitution's first amendment — and that includes hate speech.Even though it remains one of the most taboo gestures of the Western world, it is not illegal to perform a Nazi salute or wear a swastika in the United States.Since World War II, the salute has often been used by neo-Nazis and white nationalists. In 2016, for example, a shocking video showed a white supremacist group supporting Donald Trump 's 2016 Presidential win by raising their arms in an apparent Nazi-style salute.In January, Elon Musk, who openly supports Germany's far-right Alternative for Germany party, came under scrutiny for performing what looked like a Nazi-style salute at US President Donald Trump's inauguration. Many claimed it was an accidental likeness, while others said it was intentional.In response, activists from campaign group Led by Donkeys projected an image on his Tesla factory just outside of Berlin showing Musk doing the gesture, with the title appearing as ""Heil Tesla."" The group felt that if the German authorities considered the symbol to be illegal according to the country's Criminal Code, it would prove Musk had actually done the gesture.Musk has come under fire for expressing antisemitic views in recent years, including responding to a user on X in 2023 who accused Jews of hating white people, a conspiracy theory popular among white supremacists. ""You have said the actual truth,"" Musk tweeted in a reply to the user.The recent Kanye West video and the scramble to take it down have caused a renewed look at the content policies of major tech companies, particularly the social media platforms owned by Meta.In light of the video, the Anti-Defamation League, a US-based, international non-governmental organization that combats antisemitism, bigotry and discrimination, started a petition asking Facebook and Instagram to ""reinstate guidelines meant to protect users from disinformation and hate"" on Facebook and Instagram in response to changes made earlier this year.Meta announced in January they would no longer employ fact-checkers, and loosened rules around hate speech and abuse in light of ""recent elections"" — a reference to Donald Trump's presidential win.Yet, the pro-Hitler rhetoric spouted by West's latest single still falls under the company's rule of prohibiting ""harmful stereotypes historically linked to intimidation, including Blackface and Holocaust denial.""","Ye's latest track references the words of the nazi salute ""heil hitler"" (""hail hitler""), which was used while adolf hitler was in power.

'Military-linked company'





HONG KONG: Chinese EV battery giant CATL aims to raise $4 billion in its Hong Kong listing scheduled for May 20, said a statement filed to the bourse Monday, making it the largest IPO expected in the city so far this year.A global leader in the sector, CATL produces more than a third of all electric vehicle (EV) batteries sold worldwide, working with major brands including Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen.The company is already listed in Shenzhen, and its plan for a secondary listing in Hong Kong was announced in a December filing with the stock exchange.According to a prospectus filed Monday, CATL will offer approximately 117.9 million units priced at up to HK$263 per share ($33.8) for total expected proceeds of HK$31.01 billion.The listing is set to take place next Tuesday (May 20).Cornerstone investors, including Sinopec and Kuwait Investment Authority, agreed to buy shares worth HK$2.62 billion, the prospectus shows.Founded in 2011 in the eastern Chinese city of Ningde, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (CATL) was initially propelled to success by rapid growth in the domestic market.But the world's largest EV market has more recently begun to show signs of flagging sales amid a broader slowdown in consumption.The trends have fuelled a fierce price war in China's expansive EV sector, putting smaller firms under huge pressure to compete while remaining financially viable.But CATL continues to post solid performances, with its net profit jumping 32.9 percent in the first quarter.Funds raised from a secondary listing could be used to accelerate CATL's overseas expansion, particularly in Europe.The battery giant is building its second factory on the continent in Hungary after launching its first in Germany in January 2023.In December, CATL announced that it would work with automotive giant Stellantis on a $4.3 billion factory to make EV batteries in Spain, with production slated to begin by the end of 2026.Earlier analysts said CATL's float could be a blockbuster initial public offering that could boost Hong Kong's fortunes as a listing hub.Hong Kong's stock exchange is eager for the return of big-name Chinese listings in hopes of regaining its crown as the world's top IPO venue.The Chinese finance hub saw a steady decline in new offerings since Beijing's regulatory crackdown starting in 2020 led some Chinese mega-companies to put their plans on hold.In a list issued in January by the US Defense Department, CATL was designated as a ""Chinese military company"".The United States House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party highlighted this inclusion in letters to two American banks in April, urging them to withdraw from the IPO deal with the ""Chinese military-linked company"".But the two American banks JPMorgan and Bank of America are still on the deal.Beijing has denounced the list as ""suppression"", while CATL denied engaging ""in any military related activities"".According to Bloomberg, CATL plans to make the deal as a ""Reg S"" offering, which doesn't allow sales to US onshore investors, limiting the company's exposure to legal risks in the United States.",Chinese ev battery giant catl aims to raise $4 bn in hong kong ipo.

Although the Seattle based firm did not name the specific teams impacted, it called the move a part of its regular business review, which is a small-scale reduction in relation to the overall size of the division.“As part of our ongoing work to make our teams and programs operate more efficiently, and to better align with our product roadmap, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles,” a spokesperson was quoted as saying.The latest round of job cuts follow a similar move in 2023, when the company had trimmed certain Alexa related jobs and has been conducting similar cuts since including the Wondery podcast, stores and communication units.Despite the cuts, Amazon reported a net gain of 4,000 jobs between the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of 2025, according to its latest earnings report.The move comes as a part of CEO Andy Jassy’s broader overhaul to streamline operations by cutting down on bureaucracy and reducing the number of managerial roles.Three months ago the company rolled out a major overhaul, the biggest upgrade to Alexa in a decade, enhancing it with generative AI to make it more conversational and capable of performing tasks for users, among other new features.Amazon shares on Wednesday closed marginally lower, dipping less than 1% to $210.25.","E-commerce giant amazon announced cutting off almost 100 jobs in its devices and services division.

US-China Tariff Truce Impact

NEW DELHI: With the US and China agreeing to a tariff truce, Apple is reviewing its aggressive plans to scale up in India. While the “regular expansion and China+1 production diversification plans will continue as envisaged”, sources said the iPhone strategy being drawn up exclusively for the US market will be “temporarily put under review”.“We await clarity on the geopolitical situation and the tariffs. Things have been moving at a fast pace, and there have been many sudden changes to the US govt’s stance on tariffs, including with regards to China where duty has been reduced drastically over the past few days. We will take a breather before embarking on any mega production expansion plans in India with regards to exclusive supplies to the US,” a source told TOI.he move comes as Trump — during his current Doha visit — said that he has asked Tim Cook not to source iPhones from India when it comes to meeting the needs of the US market. Trump’s stiff stance against outsourcing comes after Apple’s assurance to the US govt that it will invest $500 billion in America over the next four years, including for setting up a new advanced manufacturing facility in Houston to produce servers. The company said that it will add an additional 20,000 hires in the US by 2029.Rattled by Trump’s tariffs, Cook had recently announced India as the mainstay for iPhone supplies to the US. “For the June quarter, we do expect the majority of iPhones sold in the US will have India as their country of origin,” Cook had said in response to a question at the company’s quarterly earnings call on May 2.Following Trump’s latest statement, Indian govt sources said that Apple has assured them about maintaining its investment plans in India through manufacturing partners Foxconn and the Tata group. “Apple has said that there will be ‘no let up’ in the regular investment plans that began in the post-Covid period after the introduction of the production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for smartphones. The China+1 diversification will continue. Only the exclusive US supplies are under review.”A senior govt official told reporters that companies decide on their production facilities based on multiple factors, including revenue, productivity and competitiveness, and these are commercial decisions.","With us and china agreeing to a tariff truce, apple is reviewing its aggressive plans to scale up in india.

Motilal Oswal Financial Services has a buy recommendation on Page Industries with the target price at Rs 57,500. Analysts said that the company showed strong volume growth with robust margin expansion during the Jan-March quarter. Analysts also model an EBIDTA margin guidance at the higher end of the 19%-21% range for FY26. They feel there is still upside risk due to strong gross margin recovery. In addition, they also feel the company’s initiations towards inventory optimization through the ARS system, new product launches, capacity expansion, and digitization initiatives will support growth.BNP Paribas has an outperform rating for Bharti Airtel with the target price at Rs 2,000. Analysts said Airtel reported strong numbers for the Jan-March period with its India mobile revenue, EBITDA and operating cash flow growing strongly. Results were largely in-line, excluding favourable exceptionals. Airtel doubled its dividend y-y, and with strong cash generation ahead, we see scope for further increases. While overall capex is set to decline, Airtel is looking to invest in high-growth areas such as home broadband, enterprise and digital while reducing subsidies in the low-growth DTH business.Elara Securities India has a buy rating on REC with the target price at Rs 650, but has reduced EPS estimates. Analysts said this was on the back of lower growth during recent months. They said REC’s growth run-rate has slowed on a high asset base and recoveries. Healthy NIMs continue to aid earnings. The company is now a steady compounder with long-term growth.ICICI Securities has an add rating on Akzo Nobel with the target price at Rs 3,700. Analysts feel Akzo Nobel’s premium/luxury positioning drove market share gain for the third year running. While the paint industry contracted in FY25 and Birla Opus also grabbed a low-mid single market share in FY25, Akzo performed well with market share gains in all four quarters of FY25. Akzo has done healthy investments in product differentiation and distribution but they believe the chief reason for market share gain is premium/ luxury positioning. In their view, the price conscious consumers are likely to be swayed away by new brands offering higher trade discounts/schemes. They also believe Akzo Nobel is in a better position to maintain its margins compared to its peers.Emkay Global Financial Services has an add rating on Jubilant Foodworks with the target price at Rs 775. Analysts said the company’s Jan-March performance was in-line with their estimates. The company continued to outperform in the Jan-march quarter too, helped by company-specific initiatives in terms of free/faster deliveries, new innovations and organizational restructuring, as broader demand remains weak. With launch of Big-Big-Pizza and anniversarization of delivery waiver, bill size has reverted to growth in the current quarter and should help deliver mid-teens growth in FY26.","Page industries showed strong volume growth with robust margin expansion during the jan-march quarter.

Whistleblower Plaint

MUMBAI: IndusInd Bank acknowledged further accounting lapses, this time in its microfinance portfolio. The private bank disclosed in a filing to the stock exchanges that it wrongly booked Rs 674 crore in interest income over three quarters in FY25. To offset this, it carried Rs 595 crore in unsubstantiated entries under “other assets.” The bank stated it reversed these amounts in Q4FY25 and has begun internal corrective measures.The disclosure follows an ET report citing a whistleblower complaint and stating that the bank’s internal audit department reopened investigations into past accounting reversals. These included entries under “other assets” and “other liabilities” listed within operating expenses. These developments took place around the time RBI decided to extend CEO Sumant Kathpalia’s term by only a year on March 6. Both Kathpalia and deputy CEO Arun Khurana resigned in the last week of April 2025, taking responsibility for a bigger derivatives accounting lapse that will have a Rs 2,000-crore impact on the bank’s financials.In its letter dated May 15, IndusInd stated the internal audit department submitted its report on May 8.The report found that “a cumulative amount of Rs 674 crore was incorrectly recorded as interest over three quarters of FY24-25,” and confirmed that “this amount was fully reversed as on Jan 10, 2025.” The bank also acknowledged that the findings were triggered by a whistleblower complaint.The ET report noted that the accounting issues were separate from those earlier disclosed. It cited the whistleblower letter sent to both RBI and the bank’s board, which flagged a Rs 600-crore discrepancy in interest income from microfinance and an alleged conflict of interest involving a senior executive.","The private bank wrongly booked rs 674 crore in interest income over three quarters in fy25.
