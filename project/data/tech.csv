Seek new markets: Govt urges seafood exporters,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/seek-new-markets-govt-urges-seafood-exporters/articleshow/123247300.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Amid concerns over the US move to impose a 50% tariff on Indian goods significantly impacting the export of India's fisheries, the government on Monday asked seafood exporters to explore alternative markets for shrimps and other fish varieties.""We have asked them (exporters) to face the current challenge bravely. There are alternative markets available... Where there is a will, there is a way,"" Union fisheries and animal husbandry minister Rajiv Ranjan Singh said after a meeting with seafood exporters.India is currently the leading supplier of frozen shrimps and prawns to the US, with its market share increasing significantly from 24.4% in 2015 to 40.6% in 2024. Since the enhanced tariff will impact India's market share in the US, the country will have to explore alternative markets. The meeting on Monday was held to chart a strategy to expand India's market reach.The alternative markets identified for the purpose include the UK, European Union (EU), Oman, UAE, South Korea, Russia and China, with there being special focus on South Korea's potential and west Asia's growing demand for Indian seafood.Emphasising the need for greater value addition and better packaging in gaining new markets, Singh said, ""We have asked them (exporters) to work in this direction"".","India is currently the leading supplier of frozen shrimps and prawns to the us.

NEW DELHI: After launching the world's costliest earth observation mission NISAR in collaboration with the US on July 30, India is set to launch a US communication satellite —Block-2 BlueBird — weighing 6,500 kg in a couple of months, Isro chairman V Narayanan disclosed on Sunday.The Block 2 BlueBird satellite features large communication arrays, up to 2,400 sq ft, and has been designed to achieve data transmission speeds of up to 12 Mbps, enabling voice, data and video communication capabilities for end users. The satellite will provide direct-to-smartphone broadband connectivity, eliminating the need for specialised terminals.The next-generation American satellite is expected to reach India in Sept and will be launched aboard LVM-3-M5, Isro's heaviest rocket, from the Sriharikota spaceport. BlueBird satellite uses AST & Science's patented technologies for connecting to cellphones in a space environment for their SpaceMobile constellation.The satellite has a communications array measuring 64.38 sq m to establish direct connectivity with cellphones via 3GPP-standard frequencies, in partnership with leading cellular service providers around the world. After NISAR, the Block-2 BlueBird launch will further boost Indo-US space collaboration.Narayanan, who was presented with an honorary Doctor of Science degree by Maharashtra governor C.P. Radhakrishnan during the convocation ceremony at SRM Institute of Science and Technology at Kattankulathur near Chennai, talked about the rapid strides India’s made in the field of space technology.He said Isro was set up in 1963, with a tiny rocket being donated by the US that year to mark the beginning of the Indian space programme. In 1975, with satellite data given by the US, Isro demonstrated ‘mass communication’ through 2,400 TV sets at 2,400 villages across six Indian states. “From that (humble beginnings), the 30th of July was a historic day for the Indian space programme. We have launched the NISAR satellite, the costliest one ever built in the world. Today, we are working shoulder to shoulder with advanced countries,” Narayanan said.","The block 2 bluebird satellite features large communication arrays, up to 2,400 sq ft.

'I've blocked the word honeypot'







FBI director Kash Patel 's girlfriend, country singer, Alexis Wilkins, addressed the issue of the 19-year age gap between her and Patel and said there are many people in the MAGA world with a huge age difference, and she doesn't see any need to justify things like that. Wilkins said anyone talking to her would understand in a minute that she can't date someone her age. ""I feel like [within] a couple of minutes talking to me, you probably couldn't picture me dating a 26-year-old,"" Wilkins said in an interview with Daily Mail. Wilkins is 26 years old, while Patel is 45.""So it's always made a lot of sense to us and our friends and everyone around us. And there's really no need to justify things like that,"" Wilkins said, adding that their relationship is on a good path. On future plans of engagement or wedding, Wilkins said they are still easing into their new whirlwind life and are now able to start things that have been delayed by business and other things.Wilkins said she had to block the word 'honeypot' from her Instagram comments as she was dragged into the Epstein controversy. She was accused of being an Israeli agent, a honeypot for which the administration closed the Epstein case.Patel and his girlfriend's age gap fueled the speculations.""I think that it started with people wanting to find and really scraping the bottom of the barrel to find a justification for the fact that they don't have this [Epstein] list in their hand and they will go find it with pitchforks,"" Wilkins said.The country singer said she started dating Patel years before she became the FBI director.

Trump’s tariffs on India: Calls for boycotting US brands

Major American brands in India, including McDonald's, Coca-Cola, Amazon and Apple, are faced with boycott demands as corporate leaders and supporters of Prime Minister Narendra Modi respond to US tariffs. India's vast population makes it a crucial market for American companies.The significance of India as a market is evident through various examples: WhatsApp, owned by Meta, has its largest user base in India, whilst Domino's operates more outlets there than any other food chain. American beverage giants Pepsi and Coca-Cola maintain a strong retail presence, whilst Apple stores and Starbucks outlets continue to attract substantial customer interest.The implementation of a 50% tariff on Indian goods by Donald Trump has strained diplomatic relations between New Delhi and Washington, leading to widespread social media campaigns and public calls to support local alternatives over American products. Whilst immediate impact on sales remains unclear, there is increasing momentum behind the movement to boycott US goods in favour of domestic options, according to a Reuters report.Manish Chowdhary, who co-founded Wow Skin Science in India, shared a video on LinkedIn advocating support for domestic farmers and startups. He emphasised the importance of elevating ""Made in India"" products to international recognition, citing South Korea's success in food and beauty sectors.""We have lined up for products from thousands of miles away. We have proudly spent on brands that we don't own, while our own makers fight for attention in their own country,"" he said.DriveU's CEO, Rahm Shastry, expressed on LinkedIn his vision for India to develop its own alternatives to major social media and tech platforms: ""India should have its own home-grown Twitter/Google/YouTube/WhatsApp/FB -- like China has.""W hilst Indian retail organisations successfully compete with international brands such as Starbucks in the local market, achieving global expansion remains difficult.In contrast, Indian technology service companies have established a strong international presence, with organisations like TCS and Infosys delivering software solutions to clients across the globe.During a Sunday gathering in Bengaluru, PM Modi issued a ""special appeal"" for self-reliance, stating that whilst Indian technology firms create products globally, ""now is the time for us to give more priority to India's needs.""Amidst ongoing anti-American demonstrations, Tesla inaugurated its second Indian showroom in New Delhi on Monday, with representatives from both the Indian commerce ministry and US embassy in attendance.","Major american brands in india, including mcdonald's, coca-cola, amazon and apple, are faced with boycott demands.

Rockstar Games ’ Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6) remains one of the most anticipated video game releases globally. Earlier in 2025, Rockstar unveiled the game’s second official trailer alongside a confirmed release date of May 26, 2026. This announcement thrilled fans but also raised cautious optimism due to Rockstar’s reputation for pushing back major game launches. Originally planned for 2025, questions linger about whether this new date will hold, especially considering the high expectations for innovative gameplay and cutting-edge graphics.The hype around GTA 6 continues to build as Rockstar reveals more details and approaches its projected 2026 release. While fans eagerly await the game, the cautious optimism around timing and pricing reflects the realities of AAA game development in today’s market.Grand Theft Auto 6 is shaping up to redefine open-world gaming once again, but patience will be key as the release date approaches.Rockstar Games is known for its meticulous development process. The company prioritizes delivering polished, expansive gaming experiences over strict adherence to release schedules. This approach often leads to delays, as seen with previous hits like Red Dead Redemption 2 and GTA 5. These delays, while frustrating for fans, usually result in critically acclaimed, technically impressive games that push the boundaries of open-world design and storytelling innovation, enhancing player immersion and long-term engagement.Take-Two Interactive, Rockstar’s parent company, confirmed in their most recent earnings report that GTA 6 is still on track for its May 26, 2026 launch. This is positive news amid speculation about possible delays, fueled by Rockstar’s history of postponing flagship titles.However, previous earnings calls from Take-Two indicated a 2025 release, which didn’t come to fruition, so this confirmation remains tentative. Fans should remain cautiously hopeful but prepared for potential shifts in the timeline.One major uncertainty surrounding GTA 6 is its pricing structure. With the gaming industry trending towards higher launch prices—Nintendo has already introduced $80 titles—there’s widespread speculation that Take-Two might follow suit. Given GTA 6’s reportedly massive budget and scale, an $80 price tag or higher is plausible, as reported.Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick told Variety that their goal is to “deliver more value than what we charge.” This suggests the company plans to justify premium pricing through quality content and added value, possibly with deluxe editions and special bonuses. Unofficial leaks hint at regional standard edition prices ranging from Rs 5,999 in India to $70 in the US, while deluxe editions could cost up to $125 in some markets.Rockstar promises GTA 6 will significantly expand upon the series’ signature open-world crime gameplay. The new installment follows protagonists Jason and Lucia in a Bonnie and Clyde-inspired storyline, set primarily in Leonida—a fictional state modeled after Florida, with Vice City at its core.The game will feature:Take-Two’s Q2 2025 earnings report showcased robust performance, with net bookings reaching $1.42 billion and total revenue of $1.5 billion, driven by existing franchises like NBA 2K25 and GTA Online. This strong financial footing allows Take-Two to invest heavily in GTA 6’s development and marketing.The company has also raised its full-year net bookings projection for fiscal 2026 to between $6.05 billion and $6.15 billion, reflecting confidence that GTA 6, alongside other titles like Mafia: The Old Country and Borderlands 4, will drive substantial sales. While GTA 6’s confirmed release date offers hope, fans should remain prepared for potential delays, given Rockstar’s history. Pricing will likely reflect recent industry trends toward premium game costs, but Take-Two’s promise of delivering value could soften that impact.With a bigger world, innovative gameplay, and a compelling dual-protagonist story, GTA 6 promises to be a milestone in open-world gaming. Players can expect a richly detailed experience that pushes the boundaries of the genre.","Rockstar games ’ grand theft auto 6 (gta 6) remains one of the most anticipated video game releases globally.

Newlyweds Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez were recently spotted hosting Leonardo DiCaprio and his model girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti aboard their $485 million superyacht Koru . The high-profile outing took place off the coast of Ibiza, a popular celebrity hotspot and luxury summer getaway destination. Leonardo DiCaprio, known for his understated style, wore a plain white T-shirt, shorts, and his trademark baseball cap and sunglasses. Vittoria Ceretti showcased her model figure in a strapless blue top and black yoga pants. Bezos opted for tropical-printed swim trunks paired with a navy T-shirt, while Sánchez layered a printed kimono over a bikini. Their casual vacation looks perfectly captured the relaxed yet exclusive atmosphere aboard one of the world’s most extravagant and expensive private yachts, making headlines among luxury lifestyle and celebrity news followers worldwide.Bezos’s superyacht Koru, meaning “new beginnings” in Māori, represents the couple’s extravagant lifestyle and new chapter together. Built by Dutch shipbuilder Oceanco, Koru stands as the world’s tallest sailing yacht, measuring 250 feet tall with three masts exceeding 230 feet each.At 416 feet wide, the yacht features three luxury decks, multiple lounges, and ultra-modern amenities. Its construction spanned five years, costing an estimated $485 million. The yacht previously sparked controversy when plans to dismantle a historic Rotterdam bridge emerged to allow Koru’s passage, leading to widespread public protests and alternative solutions by the builders.Leonardo DiCaprio’s attendance at Bezos and Sánchez’s Venetian wedding drew backlash, with critics calling him a “hypocrite” due to his outspoken environmental activism. Social media users highlighted the contradiction between DiCaprio’s climate advocacy and the carbon-heavy nature of celebrity private jet travel, pointing out that over 90 jets reportedly flew into Venice for the wedding.Despite the criticism, DiCaprio’s friendship with Bezos remains strong, as evidenced by their repeat vacations together including last year’s luxury yacht trip in Sardinia. One of the wedding’s most surprising attendees was Sydney Sweeney, who reportedly had no close personal connection to Bezos or Sánchez. Later reports revealed that Bezos and Sánchez are investing in Sweeney’s upcoming lingerie line, explaining her presence at the event. This move demonstrates how the Bezos-Sánchez social circle extends beyond personal relationships to professional collaborations, further solidifying their influence in both business and Hollywood circles.The Bezos-Sánchez lifestyle showcases a blend of ultra-luxury living, A-list networking, and strategic business alliances. Whether it’s a $40 million Venetian wedding, a $485 million yacht, or investments in rising Hollywood talent, the couple has firmly positioned themselves at the center of celebrity culture and high society.Just weeks before their Ibiza yacht trip, Bezos and Sánchez tied the knot in an opulent $40 million wedding in Venice. The three-day celebration attracted global headlines not just for its extravagance but also for the massive celebrity turnout, including Oprah Winfrey, Orlando Bloom, and Sydney Sweeney.Despite public protests in Venice over the event’s scale, insiders revealed that the wedding was surprisingly intimate. No non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) were required for guests, allowing attendees to freely share their experiences.

Tech billionaire Elon Musk has accused Apple of engaging in anti-competitive practices on its App Store, alleging that the company is making it ""impossible"" for any AI firm besides OpenAI to reach the top spot.Musk said his company xAI will pursue immediate legal action.The Tesla boss posted on his platform X, “Apple is behaving in a manner that makes it impossible for any AI company besides OpenAI to reach #1 in the App Store, which is an unequivocal antitrust violation. xAI will take immediate legal action,”Earlier in the day, Musk questioned Apple’s editorial choices on the App Store, expressing frustration over the exclusion of his companies’ apps from the platform’s featured sections.“Hey @Apple App Store, why do you refuse to put either 𝕏 or Grok in your 'Must Have' section when 𝕏 is the #1 news app in the world and Grok is #5 among all apps? Are you playing politics? What gives? Inquiring minds want to know,” he posted.The criticism adds to growing tensions between major tech platforms over control of AI distribution channels. Musk, who co-founded OpenAI in 2015 but later distanced himself from the company, has been a vocal critic of its current direction and close ties with Apple and Microsoft.As of now, Apple has not responded to the allegations. The company’s App Store policies have come under increasing scrutiny worldwide, with regulators in the EU and US probing its market practices.","Elon musk accused apple of engaging in anti-competitive practices on its app store.

Google Calendar users have noticed that several cultural observances, including Pride Month, Black History Month, and Holocaust Remembrance Day, have been removed from the platform’s default holiday list.The change, which was first reported by The Verge, has triggered criticism from users and reignited debates over tech companies’ shifting stance on diversity initiatives.Google Calendar previously included observances such as February 1 (Black History month), March 1 (Women’s History Month), June 1 (Pride Month) and November 1 (Indigenous Peoples Month).However, for 2025, these events no longer appear in the calendar’s default settings.Instead, Google now only displays public holidays and national observances sourced from timeanddate.com, a long-time data partner. The company had quietly begun this shift in mid-2024 but did not make a public announcement, leading to confusion and frustration among users, according to GB News.Following the backlash, Google spokesperson Madison Cushman Veld defended the decision and was quoted by The Verge saying, ""Some years ago, the Calendar team started manually adding a broader set of cultural moments in a wide number of countries around the world. We got feedback that some other events and countries were missing — and maintaining hundreds of moments manually and consistently globally wasn’t scalable or sustainable.""Google encourages users to manually add observances to their personal calendars and provide feedback through the built-in Calendar tool.Many Google Calendar users expressed disappointment on social media, accusing the company of downplaying important cultural moments. Some called the change ""shameful"" and accused Google of ""capitulating to fascism.""The shift comes amid a broader rollback of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) initiatives across the US tech industry. Several companies, including Meta, Intel, and PayPal, have scaled back diversity hiring programs, while Amazon removed references to ""inclusion and diversity"" from its earnings report.Disney also removed its ""Reimagine Tomorrow"" DEI program from its latest corporate report but added an initiative focused on hiring US military veterans, according to GB News.As of now, Google has not indicated whether it plans to restore the removed observances. For now, users who wish to track events like Pride Month, Black History month, and Indigenous Peoples Month must manually add them to their calendars.","Google calendar users have noticed that several cultural observances have been removed from the platform’s default holiday list.

Bill Gates Reveals Steve Jobs' LSD Suggestion to Boost Microsoft: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/bill-gates-recounts-steve-jobs-urging-him-to-take-lsd-to-boost-microsoft-report/articleshow/118133220.cms,"Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates revealed about his experimentation with drugs like LSD and Cannabis with Apple founder Steve Jobs during his teenage years.In an interview to The Independent, Gates said that he tried a lot of things because his personality is kind of optimistic, and he was willing to take risks.“But another thing about my personality is that I like my mind to work and be very logical. So I stopped doing even marijuana early in my 20s just because it made my mind sloppy, either during or the day afterwards,” Gates said.“I smoked pot in high school, but not because it did anything interesting. I thought maybe I would look cool and some girl would think that was interesting. It didn't succeed, so I gave it up,” he added.Microsoft co-founder said that former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, who didn’t know about his past drug use, teased him on the subject.“Steve Jobs once said that he wished I'd take acid because then maybe I would have had more taste in my design of my products,” recalled Gates.“My response to that was to say, ‘Look, I got the wrong batch.’ I got the coding batch, and this guy got the marketing-design batch, so good for him! Because his talents and mine, other than being kind of an energetic leader, and pushing the limits, they didn't overlap much. He wouldn’t know what a line of code meant, and his ability to think about design and marketing and things like that... I envy those skills. I'm not in his league,” he added.Gates added that he was a fan of Michael Pollan’s book about psychedelic drugs , How To Change Your Mind, and is intrigued by the idea that they may have therapeutic uses. “The idea that some of these drugs that affect your mind might help with depression or OCD, I think that's fascinating,” said Gates. “Of course, we have to be careful, and that's very different than recreational usage.”Gates expressed interest in the potential therapeutic applications of psychedelic drugs, referencing Michael Pollan's book ""How To Change Your Mind.""""The idea that some of these drugs that affect your mind might help with depression or OCD, I think that's fascinating. Of course, we have to be careful, and that's very different than recreational usage.""In his memoir, Gates describes his first LSD experience, which culminated in an unsettling dental appointment the following day while still under the drug's influence.The book reveals another LSD experience shared with future Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen and friends while watching Kung Fu. During this episode, they traced mathematical symbols on a dewy car trunk.""The two backwards Es together, side by side, to him, to us, held some profound meaning. 'Bill, see this. Existence exists,' he said as we stared at the dewy car trunk. It was one of those moments that seem perfectly cosmic at the time and purely silly once the acid wears off.""Gates ultimately stopped taking LSD due to concerns about potential memory loss. He worried about the possibility of accidentally erasing his memories, comparing his brain to a computer's data storage system.","Microsoft co-founder bill gates revealed about his experimentation with drugs like lsd and cannabis with apple founder steve jobs during his teenage years.

UK Home Buying Selling Reforms: UK to digitise property sales for faster transactions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/fit-for-21st-century-uk-to-digitise-property-sales-for-faster-transactions/articleshow/118106621.cms,"Long homebuying process in UK

The UK government is planning to digitise property sales data to speed up home purchases and reduce delays, The Guardian reports.A 12-week initiative has been launched to create standardised rules for data sharing among conveyancers, lenders, and others involved in transactions.Currently, much of the process relies on paper documents or outdated systems, causing delays. The changes aim to improve information sharing and make the process more efficient.""We are streamlining the cumbersome homebuying process so that it is fit for the 21st century, helping homebuyers save money, gain time, and reduce stress while also cutting the number of house sales that fall through,"" housing and planning minister Matthew Pennycook was quoted as saying, according to The Guardian.The initiative is part of a wider housing reform plan, including changes to planning rules, building 1.5 million homes, and leasehold reforms.Buying a home in the UK typically takes months, with delays caused by conveyancing, property searches, and document retrieval.According to Rightmove, the UK's largest online real estate portal, it takes an average of five months from offer acceptance to moving in.Rightmove CEO Johan Svanstrom explained that this follows an initial two-month period for property selection and offer agreement. He added: ""The current process also contributes to an average of more than one in five home sales falling through, and hopefully a better process can help reduce this as well.""The ministry of housing, communities and local government says full digitalisation will allow instant access to information for mortgage providers and surveyors, with single identity verification.Right now, important documents like building control and highways records are mostly on paper. Delays also happen because there are no standardised protocols for accessing and verifying electronic data.To improve this, the ministry is working with HM Land Registry (HMLR) and experts from the Digital Property Market Steering Group.HMLR will lead 10-month pilot projects with councils to test digital data sharing. Plans also include digital identity verification to speed up transactions.New leasehold legislation taking effect on March 3 will give leaseholders more control over service charge costs and remove their obligation to pay freeholder legal fees for right-to-manage claims.These changes could save leaseholders up to £3,000 on legal costs and reduce landlord obstruction tactics.Pennycook said the reforms will help leaseholders ""more easily and cheaply take control of the buildings they live in and clamp down on unreasonable or extortionate charges.""","The uk government is planning to digitise property sales data to speed up home purchases.

LONDON: Thames Water , which serves 16 million customers in and around London, is seeking court approval for up to 3 billion pounds ($3.7 billion) of emergency funding to prevent the cash-strapped company from falling into government administration.The high court in London began a four-day hearing on the financing package on Monday, with Thames Water facing off against smaller creditors who complain that the deal is too expensive and favors bigger investors. Creditors holding about 90 per cent of the company's debt have already backed the deal.Without the funding, Thames Water will run out of money in March, which could force the government to temporarily nationalize the company. Both the government and Thames Water say water will continue flowing to customers regardless of what happens.Thames Water, which has about 17 billion pounds ($20.9 billion) of debt and has been repeatedly cited for illegal sewage spills, is at the center of a nationwide backlash over rising water bills as Britain seeks to modernize its water and sewage systems to cope with climate change and a growing population.The company has been the focus of criticism from consumers and politicians who say Thames Water created its own problems by paying overly generous dividends to investors and high salaries to executives while failing to invest in pipelines, pumps and reservoirs. Company executives say the fault lies with regulators who kept bills too low for too long, starving the company of the cash it needed to fund improvements.Ofwat, which regulates water companies in England and Wales, in December approved a 35 per cent increase in Thames Water's consumer charges over the next five years. The company argued that bills needed to rise 53 per cent in order to finance needed projects and provide the financial returns necessary to attract investors.The company has until February 18 to appeal the decision.","Thames water is seeking court approval for up to 3 billion pounds ($3.7 billion) of emergency funding.

BEIJING: China's sluggish domestic consumption got a boost over the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday , with travel and retail sales both offering a slight reprieve to a dragging economy facing the prospect of an escalating US trade war.Train stations and airports across the country were jam-packed for weeks as millions returned home for the festive period in an annual migration that is expected to be a record.Official data showed there were 500 million domestic tourist trips during the eight-day holiday period, commerce ministry spokeswoman He Yongqian said Thursday.That's a 5.9 per cent jump from the same period last year, when travel numbers returned to pre-pandemic levels.Meanwhile, sales of ""key retail and catering services nationwide"" were also up, by 4.1 per cent compared to last year, He Yongqian told reporters in Beijing.The government has struggled to get China's billion-strong army of consumers to inject cash into the economy as a prolonged real estate crisis weighs on confidence.But last month, policymakers expanded a subsidy scheme for common household items, from water purifiers and refrigerators to laptops and electric vehicles.During the holiday period, sales of household appliances and communication equipment at ""key monitored retail enterprises"" were up more than 10 percent year-on-year, according to the commerce ministry.China recorded five per cent growth in gross domestic product last year, among the slowest in decades.Beijing will likely look to hit the same goal of ""around five per cent"" in 2025 but that could be hindered by threats of an escalating trade war.At the weekend, US President Donald Trump announced additional tariffs of 10 percent on all Chinese imports, with Beijing hitting back immediately with tariffs of its own, targeting coal and gas.","500 million domestic tourist trips during the eight-day holiday period.

Kenya's AI dilemma: Innovation or censorship?

A silent war is unfolding in Kenya , not on the streets but in the vast, uncharted world of the internet.Kenya's digital landscape is at a breaking point, as the government clamps down on AI-generated content and social media activism, igniting what many have described as a ticking time bomb of online resistance.In recent months, Kenya has witnessed a series of abductions targeting government critics. Notably, individuals such as cartoonist Gideon Kibet and 24-year-old Billy Mwangi were reportedly abducted after sharing AI-generated images depicting Kenyan President William Ruto in a coffin.The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights reported 82 cases of abductions since June 2024, with at least 29 people still missing as of last month.While some abductees, including Kibet and Mwangi, were released without explanation, Kenyan authorities have denied involvement in the disappearances.With AI-generated protests, viral political satire, and tech-savvy activists challenging authority, officials are scrambling to rein in a digital revolution that refuses to be silenced, leaving the East African nation standing at the crossroads of innovation and intimidation.As artificial intelligence fuels digital dissent, the government is tightening its grip on social media, wielding regulations against an increasingly vocal online population.Mark Kaigwa , a tech visionary and founder of Nairobi-based digital marketing company Nendo, told DW he sees a pattern emerging.""Citizens have, in their own way, been exercising what some would call 'greater than their freedom of expression' and many might describe as well within their rights,"" he said.With AI-generated protest anthems, satirical deepfakes, and viral political memes flooding the digital sphere, Kenya's online activism is evolving faster than authorities can contain it.One of the biggest challenges has been AI tools like Grok , embedded into X (formerly Twitter), allowing users to create shockingly realistic political imagery.With Kenya's leaders frequently the subject of these AI creations, tensions are rising over how to control the technology without stifling free speech.""Ever since Elon Musk and his team integrated Grok … their generative AI platform, you can generate images in there and some of the ones that have been generated have been of political leaders in coffins,"" Kaigwa revealed.""And some of those, of course, can be grotesque and macabre, but the question is now where this tension comes in — because you're no longer talking just about AI, you're talking about AI inside of a very popular social network.""Kenyan Interior Minister Kipchumba Murkomen last month condemned the use of AI-generated images targeting political leaders.""We will ensure that those using social media to threaten others face the full force of the law,"" he said.Kenyan officials have floated the idea of requiring social media companies to set up local offices for better regulatory oversight.However, as Kaigwa pointed out, ""All of them have a physical office, except for X now formerly known as Twitter.""Kenya has long been a digital powerhouse. The country pioneered mobile money with M-Pesa, boasts a thriving startup ecosystem, and has a social media culture that punches far above its weight.The phenomenon of ""Kenyans on X"" has reached global prominence, with online activism shaking governments, brands, and even foreign leaders.Kaigwa recounted how a planned visit by the Dutch king nearly collapsed under the weight of Kenyan digital resistance.""And even recently, we've seen an announcement of the Dutch monarchy, with the king of the Netherlands set to come to Kenya, and the actual Dutch monarchy reporting that their entire IT systems were overwhelmed with people writing emails saying, 'Hey, we don't think you should come.'""The government's struggle to control digital dissent has taken a darker turn, with allegations of online influencers being abducted or threatened.""The current regime of the day has also struggled, really, with what we might call controlling the narrative, or controlling public perception on social networks,"" Kaigwa said.""It's partly the reason that a number of prominent social media figures tend to be some of the ones abducted or who go missing and end up with serious questions regarding the authorities.""Kenya's moves mirror a growing trend across Africa.""If we look to Kenya's neighbour Uganda, they've gone about this quite differently,"" Kaigwa noted.""Over the last few years, they have had a social media tax, which meant that people had to pay the government a certain amount individually to access social networks and their messages and content there, they have done social media shutdowns.""Internet blackouts have become a favoured tool for many African governments, with estimates showing they cost economies billions of dollars in lost revenue. Kenya itself has dipped its toe into these waters.""Even in Kenya, Kenya has had several shutdowns, and most recently, just a few short months ago, I believe, in November, a shutdown of the messaging app Telegram as national exams took place,"" Kaigwa said.While cracking down on digital expression, Kenya is also positioning itself as a leader in AI policy.Ambassador Philip Tigo , Kenya's special envoy for technology and AI, has been actively engaging with global stakeholders to unlock investment and shape international policy.However, Kaigwa argues that Kenya's AI crackdown is selective.""I would argue it's not all of AI, really, here. It's a very particular type of use of AI — so generative AI, which is a subset, and then specifically, it tends to be some of the imagery that's been used.""The broader concern is misinformation and deepfakes, which are already making it harder to distinguish reality from fabrication.""Even if you knew who said it first, there's a question of whether you can find the identity of that person and to what degree that's infringing on their personal rights of expression.""Kenya stands at a defining moment: Will it embrace its reputation as Africa's Silicon Savannah, championing free expression in the digital age? Or will it follow the path of digital repression, controlling the online narrative through regulations and crackdowns?For now, as Kaigwa puts it, ""Kenyans are likely, to some degree, to seek to resist it.""","Kenya's digital landscape is at a breaking point, as the government clamps down on ai-generated content.

The focus is on the prom queen over the math olympiad champ, he said slamming the culture that worships mediocre shows like 'Friends' and encouraged more sleepovers than math tutoring. Vivek did not move from his stand though reports claimed that it was that post which got him kicked out of Elon Musk's DOGE as Musk did not like his rant against American culture, though Elon Musk too is in favour of hiring H-1Bs.Vivek Ramaswamy, however, said he had no fallout with Elon Musk and he was not fired from the department.
