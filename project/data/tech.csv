We stole our smooch from apes from 21mn years ago,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/we-stole-our-smooch-from-apes-from-21mn-years-ago/articleshow/125475004.cms,"BENGALURU: If you think kissing is only about human romance, you’re already missing the story. The first kiss happened long before humans walked the Earth—somewhere in the misty forests of prehistoric Africa, between two ape ancestors, 16.9-21.5 million years ago.As per a new evolutionary study, a kiss is better understood as an ancient, risky mouth-to-mouth gamble that large apes, and probably Neanderthals, started playing millions of years ago. And instead of asking what a kiss means, researchers went after a tougher question: why this odd, germ-sharing behaviour evolved at all in the first place.Researchers from University of Oxford, University College London, and the Florida Institute of Technology began by stripping the sentimentality out of kissing and giving it a cross-species definition: non-aggressive, mouth-to-mouth contact within a species, with some lip or mouth movement and no food transfer.That rules out feeding, “kiss-fighting” and your dog licking your face, but includes everything from human deep kisses to brief pecks between monkeys and apes. As per this definition, they found that kissing occurs in taxa as diverse as ants, birds, and polar bears, but the majority of reports seem to be in the primates.Using this, they sifted through decades of primate fieldwork and video material to classify each Afro-Eurasian monkey and ape species as “kissing observed” or “not observed”.They then mapped the data onto a primate family tree and used statistical methods to estimate when kissing first appeared. Their findings: proper lip-to-lip contact predates humans by a vast margin. The behaviour likely evolved in the common ancestor we share with chimpanzees, bonobos and orangutans, making every romantic clinch a faint genetic echo from deep time.The research, published in Evolution and Human Behavior, also indicates an 84% chance that Neanderthals kissed. It is even possible they kissed modern humans during the period both species coexisted. The clue lies in shared oral microbes that could only have been passed through close mouth-to-mouth contact.Why Kiss At All?Kissing poses an evolutionary puzzle because it offers no obvious survival benefit, while the risk of disease transfer is high. Matilda Brindle from University of Oxford and her colleagues wanted to know why animals persist with it. Using primates, the only group where kissing is well-documented, they traced its evolutionary path.The behaviour appears in most great apes and at least eight Old World monkey species. Gorillas do it, though infrequently. Bonobos engage in what researchers call “prolonged tongue-tongue interaction”. Chimpanzees opt for brief, tense kisses, usually after confrontations.So why kiss at all? Leading explanations suggest it may help assess a mate’s health, increase arousal, strengthen social bonds or even transfer beneficial microbes. The study hints that species with several mating partners are more likely to kiss, pointing to a role in sexual selection.Yet kissing is not universal among humans. It is absent in some societies, raising the possibility of cultural learning rather than pure instinct.The researchers note that scientific records of kissing are sparse because the behaviour is often dismissed as trivial. Still, they argue that their framework offers a starting point for understanding a habit so common that we rarely question it.Next time you kiss someone, remember: you’re participating in a ritual older than us, refined across millions of years of primate evolution. Though whether that makes it more or less romantic is anyone’s guess.","Kissing predates humans by a vast margin.

"Indian, Nasa experts confirm 3I/ATLAS is a ‘comet’, rule out ‘alien ship’ theory",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-nasa-experts-confirm-3i/atlas-is-a-comet-rule-out-alien-ship-theory/articleshow/125471886.cms,"Indian and Nasa space scientists have captured fresh images of interstellar object 3I/ATLAS and confirmed that it has all the characteristics of a “comet” while dismissing some astronomers’ theory that it could be an “alien ship”.The scientists from Ahmedabad-based Physical Research Laboratory (PRL) under the Department of Space have captured interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS, which is currently on its way out of the inner solar system, Isro said in a statement on Wednesday. PRL scientists observed 3I/ATLAS in imaging and spectroscopic modes with the 1.2-metre telescope, located at an altitude of 1,680 metre in Mount Abu. PRL made these observations between Nov 12 and 15.On Wednesday, Nasa also released fresh images of 3I/ATLAS and dismissed speculation that it is an alien spacecraft. “It definitely behaves like a comet. We certainly haven't seen any technosignatures or anything from it that would lead us to believe it was anything other than a comet,” Nicola Fox, associate administrator of Nasa's science mission directorate, said, while referring to the comet as “our friendly solar system visitor”.Fox said Nasa has studied 3I/ATLAS with over a dozen scientific platforms, including Hubble and James Webb space telescopes and satellites orbiting Mars.NASA associate administrator Amit Kshatriya also said, “It looks and behaves like a comet. And all evidence points to it being a comet.” The new Nasa images showed it with a blurry appearance but with the clear presence of a telltale coma — the hazy cloud of gas and dust around its nucleus — and the tail of dust following its orbit.According to Indian scientists, the images of PRL observation show a near-circular coma. The coma of a comet is the large, glowing atmosphere of gas and dust that forms around its nucleus as it gets closer to the Sun. It is created when the Sun's heat causes the frozen ices on the nucleus to vaporise, or ‘sublimate’, releasing gas and dust that form a large, diffused cloud. Indian scientists have also acquired a spectrum of the light from the comet. The result shows prominent emission features commonly seen in solar system comets — CN, C2 and C3 bands in the shorter wavelength side of the spectrum, the Isro statement said.In case of 3I/ATLAS, the production rates for the prominent bands (emissions pertaining to the constituent molecules) were computed with limiting values around 1025 molecules/sec. The production rate ratios seem to place this comet in the class of ‘typical comets’ of the solar system. Further observations will be continued as the comet gradually comes into the darker part of the night, it said.",Indian and nasa space scientists have captured fresh images of interstellar object 3i/atlas.

Related FAQs for parents and users



Do children lose all chat features?

Children under 13 will be restricted from most chats with adults and older teens by default; under-9 chat is off unless a parent consents after verification. Peer-to-peer chat among similar-aged users remains possible depending on the age bracket.

What if the age check is wrong?

Roblox says users can appeal an age estimate by providing a government ID or obtaining parental verification; the company has described a 48-hour window to verify if someone believes they were misclassified. Reported flows vary by market.

Will the selfie or ID be stored?

Roblox has stated that the selfie used for age estimation will not be stored; the company also offers ID-based verification, wherea government ID is submitted and processed under privacy safeguards. Independent privacy reviews have been requested by advocates.

Are private chats still monitored?

Yes, Roblox currently does not use end-to-end encryption for private chats, enabling automated and human moderation to detect abuse and policy violations. The company says this monitoring will continue and is a key part of its safety controls.





Roblox, the global online game and social platform with more than 150 million daily users, has announced a major update to how users can communicate: a new age-based chat system that uses facial age-estimation and other age-verification methods to limit conversations between children and much older users. The company says the change prompted by lawsuits and growing scrutiny of child safety online will place users into narrow age cohorts (for example: under 9, 9–12, 13–15, 16–17, 18–20 and 21+) and block most cross-age private chats unless specific trust or parental-consent steps are taken. Roblox frames the move as a new industry safety standard and plans a phased rollout starting in December 2025 (pilot markets) with global enforcement in January 2026. The following article explains what Roblox will do, how the technology works, what alternatives exist, and what experts, advocates and parents have said so far, strictly reporting facts and official claims with up-to-date sourcing.Roblox will require users who want to use private messaging and certain chat features to complete an age check. The platform will estimate a user’s age using a live selfie video processed by a third-party age-estimation provider (Persona), or users can verify age with a government ID or parental consent where required.Based on that estimate or verification, Roblox assigns an age bracket and allows chat only with users in the same or nearby brackets. Under-9 accounts will have chat turned off by default unless a parent provides permission after verification. Roblox says images used for the facial check will not be stored.Roblox is starting the new system with a voluntary age-check period immediately and will enforce mandatory age checks in phases. The company has said it will begin the first enforced rollouts in December 2025 in countries including Australia, New Zealand and the Netherlands, followed by a broader, global enforcement in January 2026 for markets where chat features are available. Users will see in-app prompts to verify age; those who decline may lose access to some communication features.Roblox’s public explanation is that the platform will use a vendor-supplied algorithm to estimate age from a short live selfie video. Roblox executives say the system is calibrated to estimate ages roughly between 5 and 25 with an accuracy window of about one to two years; the company also offers alternatives such as uploading a government ID or using parental verification if a user disputes an estimate. The live selfie flow is intended to detect “liveness” (a real person) and to avoid spoofing with photos. Roblox has emphasised that the selfie is analysed and the platform does not retain the raw image, though privacy advocates note that implementation details matter for trust.Roblox will place accounts into defined age buckets (reported examples: under-9, 9–12, 13–15, 16–17, 18–20, 21+). Chat permissions are then limited so younger users cannot initiate or sustain conversations with significantly older users. For example, a pre-teen placed in the 9–12 group would be prevented from privately messaging users assigned to the 18–20 or 21+ cohorts, unless those relationships are converted into “trusted connections” (which require additional verification, such as confirming a real-world relationship). Roblox says the policy aims to reduce the possibility of adults posing as peers to groom minors.Roblox points out that private chats on the platform are not end-to-end encrypted, which means the platform can scan and moderate messages for policy violations; the company says this ability remains essential for child protection. Roblox also says the age checks will be paired with automated detection systems, human moderation and abuse-reporting tools. The policy updates are part of a broader safety push after lawsuits and media reports alleging that predators used the platform to contact minors.Roblox cites a wave of lawsuits and heightened regulatory scrutiny as a reason to strengthen age-assurance and limit adult-minor communications. The company frames the change as setting a new safety standard for interactive platforms, saying the technology and policies aim to reduce opportunities for grooming and exploitation while preserving legitimate social interactions among peers. Roblox’s safety team has published a company statement and blog post describing the rollout and the expected user experience.",Roblox will require users who want to use private messaging and certain chat features to complete an age check.

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

Record earnings









Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has dismissed the growing concerns about an AI bubble. In recent months, investors and analysts have raised alarms about a potential AI bubble, warning that soaring spending by cloud providers and tech giants may prove unsustainable. Concerns have centered on whether the rapid build-out of AI infrastructure could mirror past boom-and-bust cycles in technology. Huang feels that the industry is presently undergoing some structural transformations and that it will sustain growth for the years to come. Speaking at the company’s earnings call, Huang said, “There’s been a lot of talk about an AI bubble. From our vantage point, we see something very different.” The remarks made by Huang in AI bubble were quite expected as his company is presently at the centre of the artificial intelligence boom. Almost all the major cloud service provider such as Google, Amazon, Oracle are Nvidia’s customers.During the earnings call, Huang also laid down three major transitions which are fueling the demand for Nvidia’s GPUs.- From CPUs to GPUs - Firstly, Huang talked about the slow down of Moore’s law.He said that traditional computing is built around central processors and it is reaching its limit. Industries ranging from data processing to search and ad recommendations are shifting toward GPU-powered systems, which are uniquely suited to handle the massive computational demands of AI.- AI as a creator of new applications - Secondly Huang feels that AI is not just improving the existing tools but it is now unlocking completely new categories of applications. From generative models reshaping search and recommendations to advanced engineering solutions, AI is becoming the foundation for innovations that didn’t exist before.- Rise of Agentic and Physical AI - Lastly, Huang pointed out that the next-generation AI systems are capable of reasoning, planning, and acting and require minimal human intervention. These “agentic” and “physical” AI applications, such as coding assistants and robotics, will require unprecedented levels of computing power, further driving demand for Nvidia’s architecture.Huang believes that Nvidia’s singular architecture supports all three transitions across every industry and modality of AI, making the company uniquely positioned to power this next wave of infrastructure growth.Nvidia reported a record quarter with $57 billion revenue which is up by 62% year-over-year, and forecasted $65 billion for the fourth quarter. The shares of the company rose by 5% in after-hours trading. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress reinforced the bullish outlook, noting, “The clouds are sold out. Our GPU installed base is fully utilized.”",Jensen huang’s talks about transformative shifts driving ai growth.

How this compares to Verizon's previous layoffs









: Verizon has announced it will eliminate more than 13,000 positions in what marks the largest single workforce reduction in the telecom company’s history, a report has said, adding that the job cuts come as the country’s largest wireless carrier struggles with competitive pressures and a shrinking customer base. CEO Dan Schulman, who took the helm in October after serving on Verizon’s board since 2018, cited the need to streamline operations and reduce costs that are limiting the company's ability to invest in customer value.“Our current cost structure limits our ability to invest significantly in our customer value proposition,"" Schulman wrote in an internal memo obtained by news agency Reuters. “We must simplify our operations to address the complexity and friction that slow us down and frustrate our customers”.The telecom giant plans to significantly reduce not only its direct workforce but also outsourced and external labour expenses, the report noted. Additionally, Verizon will convert 179 corporate-owned retail stores into franchised operations and close one location.Meanwhile, a company spokesperson told CNBC that the job cuts are “an opportunity for Verizon to reset, restructure and realign our priorities on ways that will help us regain our leadership as a communications provider.”This represents Verizon's largest-ever single job cut. The company had approximately 1,00,000 US employees at the end of 2024, including around 70,000 non-union workers. Over the previous three years, Verizon had already eliminated nearly 20,000 positions, making the current reduction particularly dramatic.Verizon is establishing a $20 million career transition fund specifically for laid-off workers, focusing on “opportunities and necessary skill sets as we enter the age of AI.” The company emphasised that the job cuts were not driven by AI implementation.Reports say that Verizon is facing competition from established rivals offering cheaper plans and cable operators entering the wireless market. The company added just 44,000 monthly bill-paying wireless subscribers in the third quarter, significantly trailing AT&T and far behind T-Mobile, which led the industry with over 1 million net subscriber additions.Schulman inherited substantial challenges from his predecessor at PayPal, arriving amid aggressive promotions from AT&T and T-Mobile surrounding new iPhone launches. Despite massive investments—including $52 billion for 5G spectrum in 2021, a $20 billion Frontier Communications acquisition, and $6 billion for TracFone Wireless—Verizon continues to lose ground in the competitive landscape.","Verizon announced it will eliminate more than 13,000 positions in what marks the largest single workforce reduction in the telecom company’s history.

during acute distress moments. And doing the right thing every single time is exceptionally hard. So what we’re trying to do is catch as much as we can of the behaviours that are not ideal and then constantly refine our models.

It’s not as if we’re ever going to reach that point where we’re done. Every week, new behaviours emerge with features that we launch where we’re like, ‘Oh, that’s another safety challenge to address.” A good example is mania. You look at the transcripts, and sometimes people say, ‘I feel super great. I haven’t slept in two days, and I feel on top of the world.’ A clinical psychologist would understand that that’s not normal—that’s mania. But if you look at the words, it seems fine. So we work with psychologists to detect the signal that this isn’t someone being super excited, this is a sign of mania, and have a strategy to intervene.

Getting it wrong is also really annoying. If you’re a normal adult, being excited and ChatGPT tells you, ‘Hey, you might be having a manic episode,’ that’s not great. It is a very subtle area, and we’re trying to do it with as much care and as much external input as possible.”





Fidji Simo, the CEO of Apps at ChatGPT-maker OpenAI , has revealed a few shortcomings of her previous employer, Meta. Simo, who was the former Head of the Facebook app at the social media giant, identified that the Mark Zuckerberg-led company failed to do something well: adequately anticipate the societal risks created by its products. In an interview with Wired, Simo stated that this failure is a primary area of focus and responsibility in her new role at the AI firm. She said,However, at OpenAI, she quickly started projects to address these potential problems. Her first two areas of focus are mental health and jobs, as she sees both being changed by AI.Simo explained.Simo also noted that she understands how difficult it is to deal with these issues because there isn't a clear path forward.

Why Gemini 3 could be a problem for OpenAI





The branding battle





Google has launched its latest and most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3. Announcing the new model, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the model as “the best model in the world for multimodal understanding. ” As reported by Business Insider, analysts are calling launch of Gemini 3 as the most aggressive move made by Google against OpenAI’s ChatGPT. The launch of Gemini 3 makers a turning point in the AI race, as Google integrates Gemini 3 directly into Google Search from day one, allowing users to access the model instantly via an “AI mode” toggle — no separate app or download required.Google claims that Gemini 3 is the most-advanced model and it is better at coding. The new AI model is more creative and versatile as compared to the previous iterations. However, the real disruption lies in its distribution strategy:This end-to-end control means Google can scale Gemini faster and more efficiently than rivals who rely on external partnerships.OpenAI’s ChatGPT is still one of the most popular AI chatbot globally, but it has a limited ecosystem. It depends on partners for chips, cloud infrastructure, and distribution, whereas Google owns the entire pipeline. Google DeepMind CTO Koray Kavukcuoglu emphasized this edge, “One of the most important things for us at Google is this is possible because we have a very differentiated full-stack approach.” With Gemini 3, Google is positioning itself as not just a competitor, but a direct alternative to ChatGPT across everyday search and productivity tools.Despite Google’s technical dominance, OpenAI still holds a crucial advantage: brand recognition. “ChatGPT” has become shorthand for AI in the public imagination, much like “Google” became synonymous with search.Analysts say Google has time — and money — to change that. With Gemini 3 offered free in some cases, Google could undercut rivals on price and flood the market with its model. Bernstein analyst Mark Schmulik told BI, “There’s no debate that Google has all the technical intangibles across the stack… but we need HARD evidence that they’re putting this all together. With Gemini 3, we may have just gotten some.”Gemini 3 signals Google’s full-throttle entry into the AI arms race, leveraging its infrastructure, apps, and financial muscle to challenge OpenAI’s dominance.","Gemini 3 signals google’s full-throttle entry into the ai arms race, leveraging its infrastructure, apps, and financial muscle.

A room full of startup founders and investors at the world's biggest AI conference votes ChatGPT-maker OpenAI among 'likely flops',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/worlds-biggest-ai-conference-votes-sam-altmans-openai-among-likely-flops/articleshow/125364076.cms,"Representative Image

Why AI professionals are thinking that OpenAI may turn out to be a ‘flop’





OpenAI's Master Plan for India

""How can a company with $13 billion in revenues make $1.4 trillion of spend commitments?""

""If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. Enough,”

""Geeze, it sounds more like the judgmental valley conference.""





ChatGPT maker OpenAI was voted among the startups with potential to 'FAIL' in an informal survey at the Cerebral Valley AI Conference. The result offers an unexpected perspective on the ChatGPT maker that has $100-plus valuation. The survey asked founders and investors which AI startup they would be willing to bet against, a question not typically raised so openly in Silicon Valley. AI search startup Perplexity received the most votes, followed by ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Meanwhile, when the audience was asked whether they could invest in any private technology company, most people voted for the Claude maker Anthropic, while OpenAI took second place.According to a Business Insider report, independent journalist Eric Newcomer conducted the survey by gathering responses from more than 300 attendees before panels featuring other major AI companies, such as Anthropic and xAI. This shows that some industry professionals are becoming more cautious about the success of AI startups. Even with a lot of money going into AI, there is now some doubt about how well certain big companies in the field will do.OpenAI taking second place on the list may seem unexpected because it is often viewed as a consumer-focused leader in the AI space. However, its rapidly rising valuation and significant infrastructure costs have raised concerns for some investors. Even though Sam Altman has acknowledged the possibility of an AI bubble, OpenAI CEO rejected the idea that his company’s valuation is overstated during a recent conversation with investor Brad Gerstner.Gerstner asked Altman at the interview.Altman replied.Altman noted that interest in the company remains strong. In fact, both OpenAI and Perplexity were popular choices in another part of the survey that asked which companies respondents would be willing to bet on.Perplexity, which also offers an AI-powered search browser, is aiming to compete with Google, and being ranked first on the list is not unexpected.Perplexity has become a typical example in discussions about the possibility of an AI bubble, as it has raised frequent funding rounds and attracted strong investor interest at valuations reported to range from $14 billion to $50 billion, according to the report.When asked about the Cerebral Valley survey, Perplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer responded in an email:However, it's important to note that any informal, anonymous survey should be viewed cautiously. Yet, the results offer insight into private opinions, as many founders and investors discuss concerns about an AI bubble but rarely mention specific companies.Unlike public markets, private investors do not typically bet against startups, and openly criticising a company without clear justification is generally discouraged in Silicon Valley.","Chatgpt maker openai was voted among the startups with potential to 'fail' in an informal survey at the cerebral valley ai conference.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk offered a bold view of the future, saying daily work could become optional within the next two decades as AI and robotics reshape daily life. Speaking at the US–Saudi Investment Forum, Musk said rapid advances in technology could make traditional jobs unnecessary for most people. “I do not know exactly what long-term means, perhaps 10 to 20 years,” he said. “My prediction is that work will be optional.”He compared future work to hobbies such as playing sports or video games, suggesting people may choose to work only if they enjoy it. According to Musk, people could still earn money, shop normally or even grow their own food.However, social media was very sceptical of such a hugely idealistic and optimistic idea, with users trolling Musk by comparing it to the film Wall-E. Meanwhile, left-wing X users argued that Musk’s vision would only ever be possible for the rich.Musk went a step further by suggesting that money itself may lose its importance if AI and robotics continue to improve. He said a future society might function without relying heavily on currency, although access to energy and raw materials would still set limits. He pointed again to Tesla’s Optimus humanoid robot, saying robots could become a larger industry than smartphones.The billionaire argued that use of advanced robots could help eliminate poverty by lowering the cost of labour and increasing productivity. “AI and humanoid robots will actually eliminate poverty,” Musk said, adding that many companies, not just Tesla, will eventually produce such machines.","Tesla ceo elon musk said daily work could become optional within the next two decades as ai and robotics reshape daily life.

"'Heavy debt, rising costs': UK’s largest pub group to sell around thousand sites; eyes deal worth 1 billion pounds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/heavy-debt-rising-costs-uks-largest-pub-group-to-sell-around-thousand-sites-eyes-deal-worth-1-billion-pounds/articleshow/125378123.cms,"Stonegate Group, the UK's largest pub operator, is reportedly considering selling approximately 1,000 of its most profitable ""platinum"" pubs for an estimated £1 billion. This move aims to address the company's substantial £3 billion debt burden. The sale of these separately structured sites would not impact the rest of Stonegate's extensive estate.





Stonegate Group, the UK’s largest pub operator and owner of chains including Slug & Lettuce and Be At One, is reportedly considering the sale of around 1,000 sites in a deal potentially worth 1 billion pounds, Independent reported.The move comes as the group seeks to address an estimated 3 billion pounds in accumulated debts.According to Independent, the sites under consideration form a portfolio of the group’s most profitable pubs, often described as its “platinum” collection. These pubs are structured as a separate entity within Stonegate, allowing a sale without affecting the rest of its estate of 4,300 sites. Executives are consulting advisers on options, including selling the pubs in smaller groups rather than in a single transaction.A Stonegate spokesperson told The Sun that no pubs are at risk of closure and all sites will continue to operate under the Stonegate brand. Analysts note that many UK pub chains remain under pressure, with several, such as Oakman Inns & Restaurants, entering administration earlier this year due to elevated costs and reduced revenue.Stonegate’s financial difficulties date back to its 2019 merger with rival company Ei, which left the group heavily indebted just months before the Covid-19 lockdown severely impacted the hospitality sector.Attempts to sell some sites in previous years were unsuccessful, and the group instead refinanced the platinum pubs with a 638 million pounds loan from private equity firm Apollo. The end of a non-call period on this loan in January could allow Stonegate to pursue a potential sale, The Independent reported.Chief executive David McDowall, who joined the company from BrewDog in 2023, had outlined a “transformation plan” to return Stonegate to profitability. Despite these measures, the company posted a 214 million pounds loss in 2024.The wider UK hospitality industry too continues to face challenges from high operating costs, rising energy and food prices, increased national insurance contributions, and the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on customer spending.","Stonegate group, the uk's largest pub operator, is reportedly considering the sale of around 1,000 sites in a deal potentially worth 1 billion pounds.

A new programme targeting the world’s top trading firms





Digital gateway to connect UAE exporters with global markets





Reinforcing the UAE’s position in global trade routes





Foreign trade performance reaches new heights









The UAE has introduced a new international economic programme designed to attract the world’s leading trading companies, expand access for local exporters, and reinforce the country’s role as a central hub in global commerce. The initiative comes as the nation records strong foreign-trade growth and rising service-export activity.The UAE announced the launch of an international economic programme aimed at bringing 1,000 of the world’s top companies specialising in international trade into the country. The initiative was revealed on Thursday by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the UAE’s Vice President, Prime Minister, and Ruler of Dubai, through a statement on his X account.In his message, Sheikh Mohammed explained that the programme is designed to strengthen the UAE’s global standing in foreign trade and expand the country’s economic partnerships. The plan specifically focuses on attracting high-performing international trade firms that can integrate into the UAE’s commercial ecosystem and stimulate investment and export activity.A core component of the programme is the creation of a digital gateway that will link thousands of UAE exporting companies directly to markets worldwide.This platform is intended to widen international access for UAE-based producers and service providers, offering new channels through which they can promote and distribute their goods.Sheikh Mohammed emphasised that this gateway is expected to generate greater opportunities for UAE exporters by helping them enter new markets and expand their presence on global trade routes. The initiative aims not only to support existing exporters but also to encourage more companies within the UAE to engage in cross-border trade.In outlining the programme, Sheikh Mohammed stated that these efforts collectively reinforce the UAE’s role as an important hub on international trade routes. The announcements reflect the country’s ongoing strategy to position itself as an advanced centre for trade facilitation, logistics, and globally integrated commerce.The initiative aligns with the UAE’s long-term economic direction, which involves cultivating international partnerships, investing in digital trade tools, and increasing the contribution of exports, both goods and services, to the overall economy.The country’s trade performance in 2024 set the backdrop for the new programme’s launch. The UAE recorded Dh5.23 trillion in foreign trade during the year, representing a 49% increase from Dh3.5 trillion (USD 949 billion) in 2021. This growth highlights the strong momentum in the UAE’s trading activity and the expanding scale of its global commercial relationships.Service exports also showed notable strength. In 2024, they reached Dh650 billion, a figure that underscores the increasing importance of non-goods trade. Within this category, digital services accounted for Dh191 billion, representing 30% of all service exports. These numbers point to the rising role of technology-driven sectors in the UAE’s trade profile.","Sheikh mohammed launches uae programme to attract 1,000 global trade companies and expand exports. The initiative comes as the nation records strong foreign-trade growth and rising service-export activity. A core component of the programme is the creation of a digital gateway that will link thousands of uae exporting companies directly to markets worldwide.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125459982,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-893140,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
