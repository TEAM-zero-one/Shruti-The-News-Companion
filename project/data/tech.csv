The Road Ahead

Ten years ago, we embarked on a bold journey into uncharted territory with great conviction. While decades were spent doubting the ability of Indians to use technology, we changed this approach and trusted the ability of Indians to use technology.While decades were spent thinking that use of technology will deepen the gap between the haves and the have-nots, we changed this mindset and used technology to eliminate the gap between the haves and the have-nots.When the intent is right, innovation empowers the less empowered. When the approach is inclusive, technology brings change in the lives of those on the margins. This belief laid the foundation for Digital India : a mission to democratise access, build inclusive digital infrastructure, and opportunities for all.In 2014, internet penetration was limited, digital literacy was low, and online access to govt services was scarce. Many doubted whether a country as vast and diverse as India could truly go digital. Today, that question has been answered not just in data and dashboards, but in the lives of 140 crore Indians. From how we govern, to how we learn, transact and build, Digital India is everywhere.In 2014, India had around 25 crore internet connections.Today, that number has grown to over 97 crore. Over 42 lakh km of optical fibre cable equivalent to 11 times the distance between Earth and the Moon now connects even the most remote villages.India's 5G rollout is among the fastest in the world, with 4.8 lakh base stations installed in just two years. High-speed internet now reaches urban hubs and forward military posts alike including Galwan, Siachen and Ladakh.India Stack, which is our digital backbone, has enabled platforms like UPI, which now handles 100+ billion transactions a year. Around half of all real-time digital transactions happen in India.Through Direct Benefit Transfer, over Rs 44 lakh crore has been transferred directly to citizens, cutting out middlemen and saving Rs 3.5 lakh crore in leakages. Schemes like Svamitva have issued 2.4 crore+ property cards and mapped 6.4 lakh villages, ending years of land-related uncertainty.India's digital economy is empowering MSMEs and small entrepreneurs like never before. ONDC (Open Network for Digital Commerce) is a revolutionary platform which opens a new window of opportunity by providing a seamless connection between huge market of buyers and sellers.GeM (Govt E-Marketplace) enables the common man to sell goods and services to all arms of govt. This not only empowers the common man with a huge market but also saves money for the govt.ONDC recently crossed 200 million transactions, with the last 100 million in just six months. From Banarasi weavers to bamboo artisans in Nagaland, sellers are now reaching customers nationwide, without middlemen or digital monopolies.GeM has also crossed Rs 1 lakh crore GMV in 50 days, with 22 lakh sellers including 1.8 lakh+ women-led MSMEs, who have fulfilled orders worth Rs 46,000 crore.India's Digital Public Infrastructure - from Aadhaar , CoWIN, DigiLocker and FASTag to PM-WANI and One Nation One Subscription - is now studied and adopted globally.CoWIN enabled the world's largest vaccination drive, issuing 220 crore QR-verifiable certificates. DigiLocker, with 54 crore users, hosts 775 crore+ documents, securely and seamlessly.Through our G20 presidency, India launched the Global DPI Repository and a $25 million Social Impact Fund, helping nations across Africa and South Asia adopt inclusive digital ecosystems.India now ranks among the top three startup ecosystems in the world, with over 1.8 lakh startups. But this is more than a startup movement, it is a tech renaissance.India is doing extremely well when it comes to AI skill penetration and AI talent concentration among our youth. Through the $1.2 billion India AI Mission, India has enabled access to 34,000 GPUs at globally unmatched prices at less than $1/GPU hour making India not just the most affordable internet economy, but also the most affordable compute destination.India has championed humanity-first AI. The New Delhi Declaration on AI promotes innovation with responsibility. We are establishing AI Centres of Excellence across the country.The next decade will be even more transformative. We are moving from digital governance to global digital leadership, from India-first to India-for-the-world.Digital India has not remained a mere govt programne, it has become a people's movement. It is central to building an Aatmanirbhar Bharat, and to making India a trusted innovation partner to the world.

NEW DELHI: The Cabinet Tuesday approved the Rs 1-lakh crore Employment Linked Incentive (ELI) scheme, aimed at generating more than 3.5 crore jobs in the organised sector.Announced in July 2024, the scheme is meant to counter criticism over inadequate jobs being created in the economy at a time when there is a rising number of job seekers in the market. The decision comes ahead of assembly elections in Bihar, West Bengal, Assam, Kerala and Tamil Nadu.I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said the scheme was finalised after detailed deliberation with industry leaders and other stakeholders.The scheme has two elements, one targeted at first-time employees who earn up to Rs 1 lakh a month and are members of the Employees Provident Fund Organisation.

Taylor Swift Shocks Fans With ‘Shake It Off’; Kane Brown’s Surprise Stuns Nashville Crowd

Seemingly determined to make another push into the music spotlight, Paulina Gretzky , daughter of the NHL father figure Wayne Gretzky, attracted some attention this past week. With her strong social media charisma and occasional performances in the past, she just teased her followers with a rather subtle but intriguing glance at what may well be the sound of the near future. This was almost out of character, for it did not resemble a spur-of-the-moment shot; it appeared to be very purposefully staged. In a past life or two, the teenage years have dabbled in entertainment; with these new collaborations in music, this recent post has kept people buzzing once more.Mostly known for the glitz behind being a model and shining on social media, music has always been a shadow lurking behind her. This move looks like more than just a feather in the cap. Over the weekend, she posted on Instagram a picture of her car dashboard displaying a track titled ""If These Heels Co ..."" with her name attached to it. The photo seemed to be an almost clear indication that she had been working on a project, sending her followers into a frenzy of speculation.Indeed, this isn't Paulina's inaugural musical outing: Earlier, she lent her vocals to an album track, ""Collecting Dust,"" which found its way onto MTV's Laguna Beach.Yet she never saw herself full-time as a musician until now, with her current sessions in Nashville marking the deliberate and serious kinds of making music again. With a big partner shop behind her in Tyler Reeve and Chris Young, and entertainment credentials that include Fame and Grown Ups 2, I think she shall carry the weight of the Media to lift her music.The announcement was preceded by some earlier signs indicating that a musical comeback was on its way. In March, Paulina posted a bunch of pictures showing her in a Nashville studio. Some showed her next to the professional soundboard, alongside country singer Tyler Reeve. They seemed relaxed and focused; all clear signs of an actual creative partnership working at full swing. One such image showed Reeve playing guitar while Paulina remained seated beside him, which resembled the organic kind of collaboration that one might expect in a songwriting session.The direction had already been hinted at a few months earlier by Paulina. In December, she had shared Instagram stories with Reeve and Chris Young-the country artist-whilst at the studio for some sort of holiday-related project. The studio was decked out in Christmas lights and a neon sign declaring: ""All I Want for Christmas Is You."" Paulina also posed for a picture with both musicians in front of the decorated tree to cement the warm association.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky’s daughter, Paulina Gretzky, embraces a stunning new look that blends comfort and elegance With her name having been linked to an unreleased song, Paulina Gretzky seems set to embark on a new chapter in her creative life.

And if there ever was a future for the Gretzky name, fans might be cheering both for style and sound this time around.","Paulina gretzky posted on instagram a picture of her car dashboard displaying a track titled ""if these heels co..."" with her name attached to it.

Giannis’ Real Reaction: No Goodbye Post

Why the Rumor Spread

The Bucks’ Perspective and Giannis’ Future

Themade a bold move by waiving, a move that immediately raised questions about the future of the franchise and the mindset of its superstar,. Amidst the social media frenzy, rumors quickly circulated that Giannis had posted a ""goodbye"" message—fueling speculation about his own future in Milwaukee. Here’s what actually happened, based on the latest credible reporting.On July 1, 2025, the Milwaukee Bucks made two headline-grabbing moves: they waived Damian Lillard—stretching the $113 million left on his contract—and signed free agent center Myles Turner to a four-year, $107 million deal. Lillard, who suffered a torn Achilles in the playoffs, was expected to miss most or all of the upcoming season, prompting Milwaukee to aggressively reshape the roster around Giannis.Despite viral claims, Giannis Antetokounmpo did not post a goodbye message to Damian Lillard or the Milwaukee Bucks. Instead, his only public reaction was a cryptic social media post expressing confusion about the team’s direction. According to multiple reports, Giannis posted, “I don't know what's going on right now,” shortly before news of Lillard’s waiving broke.This message was interpreted as surprise and perhaps frustration, but it was not a farewell or an indication that he was leaving Milwaukee.NBA insider Chris Haynes, who is well-connected with both Lillard and Giannis Antetokounmpo, reported that Giannis was “not pleased” with the Bucks’ decision to waive Damian Lillard. However, Haynes clarified that Giannis’ displeasure was more about the coldness and manner of the move rather than a desire to leave the team himself. Haynes stated, “He just didn’t appreciate how it was handled,” and noted that Giannis is now reassessing his future but has not made any public demands or posted a goodbye.The rumor of a “goodbye post” appears to have originated from misinterpretations and the emotional tone of Giannis Antetokounmpo’s actual post. The Milwaukee Bucks’ decision to waive Lillard—who was brought in as Giannis’ co-star in a blockbuster 2023 trade—sparked immediate speculation about whether Giannis would follow him out the door. However, there is no evidence that Giannis has requested a trade or is preparing to leave Milwaukee at this time.Milwaukee’s front office made the move to create cap flexibility and keep the team competitive during Giannis Antetokounmpo’s prime years, especially with Damian Lillard likely sidelined for the season. ESPN’s Shams Charania reported that Giannis was on board with the acquisition of Myles Turner, and both players valued the opportunity to partner on the court. Still, the abrupt release of Lillard has added uncertainty about Giannis’ long-term commitment, with insiders noting this is “one more thing added to the equation” as he considers his future.Giannis Antetokounmpo has not shared a goodbye post following the news of Damian Lillard being waived. In fact, his only public reaction has been a cryptic message expressing confusion rather than a farewell.According to NBA insiders, Giannis is indeed frustrated by the situation, but his displeasure is directed at the process itself, not the Milwaukee Bucks organization as a whole. There are no public signs suggesting that Giannis is seeking a trade or planning to leave Milwaukee at this time.Also read: Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Becomes NBA’s Highest-Paid Player with $285M Thunder Extension After Historic MVP Season As the Milwaukee Bucks prepare to move forward with a revamped roster, all attention remains on Giannis, whose next move will be pivotal in determining the franchise’s future.

Bill Belichick and his girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, have continued with their relationship even though there have been many speculations of a potential break up. While the couple have always been trolling for their controversial age gap, things went downhill when Bill Belichick appeared for the CBS interview a few months ago. Now, Jordon Hudson recently broke her silence regarding it.A few days ago, Bill Belichick’s 24 year old girlfriend, Jordon Hudson, took to her social media and posted a bizarre clip.The clip shows Bill Belichick sitting for his infamous CBS interview while it is not perfectly audible what the NFL legend says in the video.

Travis Kelce cringes at old dating show, says it’s the worst thing he’s ever done



Travis Kelce Talks NFL Retirement, Chiefs Super Bowl Loss + Bussin’ With The Boys Meets Taylor Swift

Long before Travis Kelce ’s headline-grabbing relationship with Taylor Swift, the Kansas City Chiefs star was navigating a very different chapter of his love life—one that he now looks back on with a wince. The NFL tight end recently opened up on Bussin' With The Boys podcast, candidly discussing his past involvement in the 2016 reality dating show Catching Kelce. And if there was any doubt about how he feels about that experience, Kelce left no room for misinterpretation.“The worst thing I ever did was the dating show,” Kelce said bluntly. “‘Catching Kelce’ was the [expletive] worst thing I ever did.”The show aired for seven episodes and featured 50 women, each representing a different U.S. state, all vying for Kelce’s attention. While Maya Benberry eventually won his heart on the show, the relationship fizzled soon after. Kelce would go on to date sports reporter Kayla Nicole in an on-again, off-again relationship that lasted five years before his romance with pop superstar Swift began dominating headlines.Looking back, Kelce expressed regret—not just for how the show turned out, but for doing it in the first place.“It didn’t set me up for anything,” he said. “I didn’t realize what reality TV really was.” His remarks came with both laughter and visible discomfort, making it clear that the show remains a cringe-worthy memory.The experience, it turns out, also came with a heavy dose of locker-room ribbing. “I was like, ‘Yeah, I’m having fun, I’m having fun, I’m having fun,’ and then I was like, ‘Oh [expletive], everybody is going to be able to see this forever,’” Kelce joked. “I was getting smoked by my teammates all season.” But despite the teasing, Kelce admitted he still performed well on the field that year, so his accountability never faltered.Interestingly, the reason Kelce even agreed to the show wasn’t fame or fun—it was financial. He revealed in a 2023 interview that he had turned the opportunity down multiple times before finally accepting it because he needed the money.Now, as a two-time Super Bowl champion and one half of the most-watched celebrity couple in the world, Kelce can comfortably leave those reality TV days behind. “I don’t even think anybody watched it,” he quipped during the podcast, brushing off the embarrassment with his signature sense of humor.With his podcast New Heights thriving and his relationship with Swift in the spotlight, Kelce has clearly outgrown the shadows of Catching Kelce. Reality TV might have helped kickstart some public recognition, but it's his talent, charm, and candid nature that have kept him at the center of pop culture.Also Read: Taylor Swift's stalker threat intensifies as restraining order extended — Travis Kelce steps up to protect her","Travis kelce says joining 'catching kelce' was his biggest regret ever.

Bowen Byram could receive big offer from another NHL team this summer

Buffalo Sabres may not match a high offer and could choose to trade Bowen Byram

A young NHL defenseman may be on the move this summer. Buffalo Sabres’ restricted free agent Bowen Byram is making headlines as insiders discuss the possibility of him receiving a big offer from another team. The price could be very high, and some experts say it might be too much for the Sabres to match. Could Byram really leave Buffalo after just one season?On July 1, 2025, NHL insiders Elliotte Friedman and Nick Kypreos discussed Buffalo Sabres defenseman Bowen Byram during a segment on Sportsnet 590 The Fan. They talked about the growing possibility of Byram receiving an offer sheet from another team.Bowen Byram is a restricted free agent, meaning another team can offer him a contract, but the Sabres can match it or receive compensation in return. Kypreos said Byram could get up to $10 million per year on the open market. Friedman agreed and compared Byram’s value to Ivan Provorov, who signed a $59.5 million deal with the Columbus Blue Jackets.Friedman also shared that he heard teams were thinking about making a one-year offer sheet for Byram. That would force the Sabres to either match the offer or lose him.If a team offers Byram a contract worth $9 million or more per season, and the Sabres don’t match it, Buffalo would receive a first, second, and third-round pick in return.However, insiders believe this may not help Buffalo right now. The team wants to win now, not wait for future draft picks.Friedman and Kypreos both said the Sabres may prefer trading Byram instead of letting him go through an offer sheet. This would allow them to get better players back in return. The situation is like what happened in 2019 when Sebastian Aho signed an offer sheet with Montreal, but the Carolina Hurricanes matched it quickly.Bowen Byram signed a two-year $7.7 million deal with the Colorado Avalanche before being traded to Buffalo earlier this year in the Casey Mittelstadt deal. He’s still only 23 years old, but already seen as a top young defender.Also Read: “We Judge Women Very Harshly”: Jane Macdougall Exposes Lasting Damage From Fake NHL Affair Rumor With Kirk McLean As of now, no team has officially submitted an offer sheet.

In a significant move to strengthen its position as a global hub for innovation and skilled professionals, the United Arab Emirates has announced the expansion of its prestigious Golden Visa program. This update, made public in May 2025, adds five new eligibility categories to the 10-year residency scheme. Professionals from diverse fields including healthcare, education, digital content, e-sports, and maritime luxury can now access long-term residency benefits without employer sponsorship, making the UAE an increasingly attractive destination for global talent and their families.The UAE’s Golden Visa program, originally launched in 2019, now encompasses a broader range of professionals with the aim of accelerating economic diversification and attracting knowledge-based talent. The five newly introduced categories are:On May 12, 2025, coinciding with International Nurses Day, Dubai Health, under the directive of Sheikh Hamdan, announced 10-year visas for nurses with over 15 years of service. This decision honours the critical role of nurses in healthcare, especially as Dubai receives around 3.7 million medical tourists annually, according to Dubai Health Authority (DHA) data.Private school teachers, principals, and university academic staff in Dubai and Ras Al Khaimah are now eligible for the visa. The Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA) in Dubai and RAK DOK in Ras Al Khaimah manage the scheme, which recognizes academic excellence and allows for family sponsorship.The initiative aims to elevate the UAE’s already strong educational system, which ranks 10th globally per UNESCO.Launched at the, the creative residency track targets filmmakers and social media influencers.

Abu Dhabi’s Department of Culture and Tourism (DCT) extends similar benefits, reinforcing the UAE’s presence in the booming global gaming sector. With a gaming market valued at $1.8 billion and major events drawing significant footfall, the UAE is becoming a key player in the e-sports landscape, according to Statista.Under Abu Dhabi’sinitiative, owners of yachts longer than 40 meters, as well as executives in the yacht industry, are eligible for the 10-year residency. The visa includes family sponsorship and supports the emirate’s luxury maritime tourism industry, currently valued at $1.2 billion, per AD Ports.The Golden Visa expansion is a strategic component of the UAE’s Vision 2030, which aims to transition the national economy away from oil dependence by attracting 100,000 skilled professionals by 2030, as reported by the Emirates News Agency (WAM).The updated program is designed to reinforce critical sectors:By allowing family sponsorship across most new categories, the UAE encourages long-term settlement and community integration, a feature that differentiates it from neighbouring nations such as Qatar, where residency options remain limited.Unlike traditional residency systems that require employer sponsorship, the UAE’s Golden Visa is self-sponsored. Applications are submitted through the ICP’s online portal or licensed government-affiliated agencies in Dubai. Required documents vary by category and include:Processing takes around 30 days, according to the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP) significantly faster than countries like Singapore, where approval may take up to 90 days, as per the Ministry of Manpower (MOM).The system’s simplicity and flexibility especially appeal to freelancers and independent professionals, making it competitive with other programs such as:Crucially, this approach has helped retain top talent, with 70% of Golden Visa holders remaining in the UAE after initial issuance, as per LinkedIn data.The Golden Visa program is not just a residency plan, it’s part of a broader strategy to shape the UAE’s global identity as a destination for opportunity, innovation, and investment.The UAE’s tax-free regime, combined with long-term residency and high-end infrastructure, continues to attract high-net-worth individuals and top-tier professionals globally.","The uae’s expanded golden visa now welcomes professionals from healthcare, education, digital media, gaming, and luxury yachting with 10-year residency benefits.

Not many people think twice about their passport—until they’re applying for one. Whether travelling abroad for a dream vacation, a foreign career, or an unexpected crisis, the process can be either smooth sailing or a nightmare. In the last decade, however, India's passport operations have undergone a quiet revolution in the background.On June 24, 2025, on the occasion of the observance of the 13th Passport Seva Divas, External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar recognised this change. His speech wasn't merely formal. It was a straightforward assessment of how technology, governance, and public service have converged to impact actual people daily.In a social media update on X, Dr. Jaishankar expressed gratitude to passport officials, both in India and posted overseas, for what he labelled as a ""remarkable transformation"" in service delivery. He associated the program with three pillars: Seva (service), Sushasan (good governance), and Garib Kalyan (welfare). For the minister, these concepts are no longer theoretical—they're being implemented through services such as the Passport Seva Programme.The passport application process in India was all about delays, red tape, and queuing up for years. The picture has changed dramatically now. The Passport Seva Programme (PSP), initiated by the Ministry of External Affairs, has gradually revolutionised the way individuals apply for, obtain, and renew their passports.Dr. Jaishankar said the PSP is an expression of the government's overall vision of a ""Viksit Bharat"", a developed India with technology and governance aligned to better serve citizens. To say it in his own words, ""Seva, Sushasan and Garib Kalyan are three major pillars of governance that would take us to a Viksit Bharat. They are all expressed with prominence in our Passport Seva Programme.""This scheme is not limited to cities alone. It has spread its wings to Tier 3 and Tier 2 towns and districts with Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSKs), so that first-time applicants, migrant labourers, and students in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities can avail of passport facilities without having to travel long distances.What was once seen as a long, often frustrating ordeal has now become a smoother and more accessible process. People are able to schedule appointments with ease, receive timely updates, and walk into clean, well-managed centres with helpful staff.Among the largest announcements this year is the country-wide introduction of e-Passports. They're not new passports with a new cover, they're embedded with a microchip bearing critical personal and biometric information.Here's what makes them different:The technology used is no different from that which is already common in most developed nations, bringing India's passport program to par with the best worldwide.e-Passports have several practical advantages:As per the latest updates from the Ministry of External Affairs, e-passports are issued phase-wise and in the next few years will become the norm for all new applicants.More countries are adopting digital verification systems, and e-passports are expected to further streamline international travel. Travelers will benefit from smoother immigration checks and faster processing through automated e-gates at major airports. With the government's phased rollout underway, carrying a smarter and more secure passport is set to become the new norm for Indian citizens.One of the more frustrating parts of applying for a passport has always been the police verification process. Depending on the location, this step could delay an application by weeks.In order to mitigate that, the Ministry of External Affairs launched the mPassport Police App, a mobile app now being used by the police in 25 states and Union Territories. As per the official update in the Ministry, the app has managed to decrease verification timelines to a mere 5 to 7 days in most regions.Police officers currently get electronic notifications, can upload proof of information at the scene, and transmit real-time updates to passport offices. This not only enhances speed but also avoids paperwork by hand and follow-up delays.For students, working professionals, and first-time applicants, this alone has made the whole process much more certain and less stressful.If you want to know how to obtain an e-passport, the procedure is not that different from obtaining a normal one. Here's how you do it:Following this, you will be able to follow up on your passport online until it arrives via post.","S.s. jaishankar launches passport seva 2.0 in india.

What it means for applicants

Poll Do you think the new USCIS text message number will help reduce confusion? No Yes

The US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) announced that it will switch to a new phone number for sending text (SMS) messages. “Effective July 1, 2025, USCIS will no longer send text (SMS) messages from the phone number 468-311 (GOV-311). Our new number will be 872466 (USAIMM),” USCIS said in a press statement. This change is aimed at helping users easily recognize official messages from the immigration agency.Starting July 1, 2026, the agency will no longer use its current number, 468311 (GOV311). As announced by the immigration agency, its new number will be 872466, which spells out USAIMM, reflecting the agency’s focus on immigration services.The change is important for people who receive text updates from USCIS – such as case status alerts, appointment reminders or other notifications. USCIS advises users to save its new number – 872466 in their contacts to avoid confusion or mistaking the messages for spam.Having said that, there is no change in the type of messages sent. The agency will continue to use text alerts to update applicants about their case status.In a related news, the USCIS has issued a strong warning for immigrants, saying that green cards and visas will be revoked if a person breaks the law.
