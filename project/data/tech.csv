Around 1,250 employees are expected to march towards the facility at Sunguvarchatram, near Chennai, and the union has not sought police permission for the matter, according to its representatives.Both the labour group and Samsung alleged the other side of making unreasonable demands. The union alleged that Samsung was not willing to revoke the suspension of 23 employees and imposed a ‘punitive’ apology letter for allowing them back to work.“The company has been calling back workers since the protest began. We will gather on the plant premises demanding that the company take them back to work,” the union said.On Feb 20, a section of employees entered the factory shop floor and stopped production before police detained them.In a statement on Thursday, a Samsung India spokesperson said, “Despite our best efforts to arrive at a mutually beneficial agreement through constructive dialogue, the union continues to make unreasonable demands and is changing its position constantly, leading to an impasse in the negotiations. We uphold a zero-tolerance policy towards illegal acts within the workplace and are committed to maintaining a safe and productive environment for all.”The dispute began on Feb 5 when a section of employees started protests against the company allegedly for suspension of three union functionaries.

Did Mangione really film his own X-rated tapes?

Social media goes wild

What happens next?

The internet is in full meltdown mode after bombshell rumors surfaced claiming that accused killer Luigi Mangione kept a secret stash of high-production-value sex tapes. The alleged murderer, who has inexplicably become a thirst-trap icon online, is now at the center of a scandal that has Twitter (or X, as it’s now called) in an absolute frenzy.The wild claims were first reported by Radar, which cited an unnamed source who described the supposed tapes as ""cinema-level quality"" with ""perfect lighting."" But in a classic case of internet hysteria, there is zero actual evidence that these tapes exist. That hasn't stopped social media from losing its mind over the mere idea of them.Also read: 'No one cares’: Did Luigi Mangione’s sex-tape allegations impact donations from women fans? In a bizarre twist, Mangione—who is facing 11 criminal charges, including first-degree murder and terrorism-related offenses for allegedly gunning down UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson—has somehow become an internet sex symbol. Fans camped outside his most recent court hearing, gushing over his ""haunting stare"" and ""intellectual aura."" Now, the alleged tapes have only added fuel to the fire.The rumor mill exploded, with users either searching desperately for the so-called tapes or outright mocking the hysteria. One viral post, dripping with sarcasm, read: ""Luigi Mangione sex tapes dropped… disgusting… horrible… can’t believe we’re objectifying him… send me the link pls."" Another joked: ""Me at work casually searching for Luigi Mangione sex tape.""Despite the obsession, some users aren’t buying it. A resurfaced New York Times interview with a former roommate of Mangione claimed he had severe physical pain that prevented him from having sex. This has only deepened the mystery—how could a man who allegedly couldn’t have sex have filmed dozens of tapes?Mangione has remained silent on the rumors, though his legal defense team previously released a statement thanking his growing fanbase for their ""overwhelming support."" But with his next federal court appearance set for March 19, the internet will be watching closely—not for evidence in his murder case, but for proof that these elusive tapes actually exist.","Luigi mangione is accused of killing unitedhealthcare ceo brian thompson.

Taylor Swift's involvement in Blake Lively’s legal dispute case has now taken a major turn

Taylor Swift and Blake Lively have been inseparable for almost a decade, so the absence of Lively from Swift's Super Bowl suite in New Orleans was something of a talking point, particularly given that she came with her to last year's game in Las Vegas. Rumors have emerged of a split, which has been linked by some to Lively's recent legal battle with her co-star on It Ends With Us, Justin Baldoni. But neither Swift nor Lively has commented on the rumors, and fans are left wondering about the state of their friendship.Blake Lively and Taylor Swift have shared a strong friendship for nearly a decade, making it somewhat surprising that Lively was absent from Swift’s VIP suite at the Super Bowl in New Orleans. Just a year ago, she was by Swift’s side at the big game in Las Vegas, fueling speculation about why she skipped this year's event.There have been rumors about the two supposedly being at odds, with some speculating that Lively's current lawsuit against actor and filmmaker Justin Baldoni—her co-star in the 2024 film It Ends With Us—is the reason for the alleged feud. Neither Swift nor Lively has commented on the rumors, however, leaving fans to speculate on what is actually occurring.Blake Lively has allegedly filed a lawsuit against Justin Baldoni, alleging he sexually harassed her while filming the two of them together. The claims have been vehemently denied by Baldoni and he in turn has brought a $400 million lawsuit claiming civil extortion, invasion of privacy, and defamation against Lively's husband Ryan Reynolds as well.Taylor Swift's name came up in the controversy over an apparent text message from Lively, in which she apparently named Swift as one of her ""dragons""—a guardian in her fight with Baldoni. The actor posted a screenshot of the message, implying that Lively used Swift's name as backing for her argument.Reports indicate that Swift is not pleased to be brought into the scandal, which might have created tension between her and Lively, possibly weakening their long-time friendship.A new report from Daily Mail has revealed that Swift's involvement in the case has now taken a major turn. ""In an embarrassing new blow for Blake Lively, Taylor Swift will be subpoenaed to be questioned under oath as part of the on-going Lively vs Justin Baldoni lawsuit battle, according to a source close to the legal action,"" read Daily Mail's report.Both sides in the dispute have mentioned Swift in their filings, making her part of the first group of potential witnesses contacted by Baldoni's team. The report also mentions ""It Ends With Us"" actors Jenny Slate and Isabela Ferrer, among others, in the witness list.Also Read: Travis Kelce's beau Taylor Swift faces lawsuit with copyright infringement over several songs across various albums Swift is currently spending time with her boyfriend Travis Kelce, who announced he will not retire after a Super Bowl loss to the Philadelphia Eagles.

Florida artist Kimberly Marasco has filed a second lawsuit against Taylor Swift

A Florida artist, Kimberly Marasco, has again sued Taylor Swift, this time on Friday filing a lawsuit charging the singer with copyright infringement over several songs across various albums. This is Marasco's second lawsuit against Swift, following the same charge she brought last year against the pop singer and her production firm.In this new court fight, Kimberly Marasco has widened her claims by adding more defendants, including popular songwriters Jack Antonoff and Aaron Dessner, and giant music industry players Universal Music Group, Inc. and Republic Records. The lawsuit indicates that Marasco feels that her original material was illegally utilized, heightening the current legal conflict between her and Swift's camp.A Florida woman, Kimberly Marasco, has filed a new lawsuit against Taylor Swift, alleging copyright infringement in songs from multiple albums. The lawsuit also names songwriters Jack Antonoff and Aaron Desner, Universal Music Group, Inc., and Republic Records as defendants.Judge Aileen Cannon dismissed Swift's lawsuit without prejudice in December last year due to Marasco's failure to serve it timely, but claims against Swift's production company, Taylor Swift Productions, Inc., have not been dismissed. Judge Jose E. Martinez will be presiding over Marasco's new lawsuit.Marasco's latest lawsuit includes copyright infringement claims concerning songs from Taylor Swift's album The Tortured Poets Department, specifically ""Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?"" and ""I Can Do It With a Broken Heart."" Her initial lawsuit against Swift was filed on April 10, 2024, just nine days before the album officially debuted. Swift's songs, ""The Man"" from the album Lover and ""Midnight Rain"" from Midnights, are named in both complaints.The complaint filed on Friday acknowledges the lawsuit against Taylor Swift Productions. ""Plaintiff decided to bring this, separate, lawsuit against the other Defendants not included in the previous lawsuit,"" the complaint states. ""Plaintiff will once again attempt service upon Taylor Swift but will not include Taylor Swift Productions in this lawsuit.”Kimberly Marasco, in her newly filed complaint states, ""As a direct and/or proximate result of the Defendants' wrongful conduct, the Plaintiff has been irreparably harmed.

Boston Bruins Eyeing Bigger Return from Flames at NHL Trade Deadline Amid Brandon Carlo Speculations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/boston-bruins-eyeing-bigger-return-from-flames-at-nhl-trade-deadline-amid-brandon-carlo-speculations/articleshow/118737459.cms,"Image Via Getty Images

A Brandon Carlo To Flames Deal Could Create A Bigger Opportunity

With the NHL trade deadline approaching, the Boston Bruins have been in the limelight with their recent activities. Just after the Bruins traded Trent Frederic and Max Jones to the Edmonton Oilers for draft picks and prospect Max Wanner, they would surely be eyeing a bigger fish. With Carlo supposedly on the radar of the Calgary Flames, Boston could set itself for a much larger return that would greatly benefit the roster into the future. This retooling type of move indicates that the team plans to enhance its roster without slowing down its long-term goals.Brandon Carlo's worth on the trade market is rising with increased speculation, especially with two years remaining on his contract with a very manageable cap hit of $4.1 million. The 27-year-old American defenseman has been a steady presence on the Bruins' blue line, making him a tempting sweetener in a deal for teams seeking defensive stability. With strong interest reportedly being expressed by the Calgary Flames to acquire Carlo, this may lead to quite a larger return relative to Frederic's worth.With several teams still in the hunt for the playoffs, this year's trade market is definitely on the side of the sellers. Boston's recent dealings with the Oilers, which saw them acquire two draft picks and a promising prospect, indicate that teams are ready to pay well for valuable assets. Should the Bruins act upon that market trend and trade Carlo, he could attract high picks and prospects that could greatly bolster the franchise's efforts in the offseason.With the Flames looking to shore up their back end with an eye toward the playoffs, the Bruins would have all the more leverage in trading Carlo. Such a deal fits neatly into Boston's short-term retooling plan while preserving guys like David Pastrnak, Brad Marchand, and Charlie McAvoy for greater glory in the future.Also Read: NHL fans express concern as Brad Marchand takes devastating hit during Bruins vs Penguins showdown The Bruins are using a calculated strategy for the day of the trade, balancing short-term goals and long-term projects. A trade of Brandon Carlo could bring the package of picks and prospects valuable to their offseason roster upgrade. There will be no total rebuild; instead, the Bruins are positioning themselves strategically to retool and be competitive. With many building blocks already in place, Boston's front office will wisely prioritize the accumulation of assets to set the stage for sustained success. Just before the deadline, the fans can expect the Bruins to make a series of calculated moves that favor their present as well as future.","Brandon carlo's worth on the trade market is rising with increased speculation.

'Worse than tariffs': Jack Daniel's maker on Canada removing US alcohol from shelves,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/worse-than-tariffs-jack-daniels-maker-on-canada-removing-us-alcohol-from-shelves/articleshow/118768841.cms,"Jack Daniel’s maker Brown-Forman ’s CEO Lawson Whiting, criticised Canadian provinces for removing US alcohol from store shelves in response to President Donald Trump ’s trade policy, calling the move ""worse than a tariff"" and a ""disproportionate response"" to the administration’s levies.In response to US tariffs on Canadian goods, several Canadian provinces, notably Ontario, the most populous, implemented countermeasures this week. Earlier on Tuesday, the Liquor Control Board of Ontario ( LCBO ), a major global alcohol purchaser, removed US-made alcoholic drinks including Jack Daniel’s from its shelves.The CEO of Brown-Forman, Lawson Whiting, criticised the Canadian reaction as ""disproportionate"" compared to the Trump administration's 25% duties on Canadian products.""I mean, that's worse than a tariff, because it's literally taking your sales away, completely removing our products from the shelves,"" Whiting said, BBC reported.Canada has imposed 25% levies on US imports, including beer, spirits, and wine in retaliation to the tariffs. Additionally, some provinces, such as Ontario and Nova Scotia, have implemented their own measures.Ontario's Premier Doug Ford announced that the LCBO's annual US alcohol sales of nearly $1 billion would cease immediately, adding that: ""As of today, every single one of these products is off the shelves.""As the exclusive Ontario wholesaler, the LCBO's decision means provincial retailers, bars and restaurants cannot replenish US products, Ford added.Whiting noted that Canadian operations represented merely 1% of total sales, making the impact manageable. However, he expressed concern about Mexico, which contributed 7% of 2024 sales, according to its annual report.Brown-Forman shares fell more than 3% on Thursday, despite being up about 8% earlier after the company reaffirmed its annual forecasts, factoring in the impact of tariffs.Despite acknowledging ""continued uncertainty and headwinds in the external environment"", Whiting expressed confidence in the company's direction.The LCBO is encouraging Canadians to support locally made products, with some already opting for domestic goods in response to Trump's tariffs.Brown-Forman has been grappling with weakening demand this year, particularly in the US, Canada, and Europe. However, growth in emerging markets like Mexico and Poland has helped offset some of the decline.To navigate a more challenging market, the company has implemented cost-cutting measures, including workforce reductions. Analysts suggest these moves reflect broader difficulties facing both Brown-Forman and the spirits industry as a whole.","Brown-forman ceo lawson whiting criticised canadian provinces for removing us alcohol from store shelves.

Dubai’s luxury real estate market has evolved into one of the most sought-after investment destinations for ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs), who see the city as a hub for premium properties and a secure place to preserve and grow their wealth. Strategic government initiatives, long-term residency programmes, and an unmatched lifestyle have propelled Dubai to the forefront of the global luxury property market, drawing in investors from every corner of the world.H.E.Sultan Butti bin Mejren, Director-General of the Dubai Land Department (DLD), attributes this success to the city's investor-friendly policies. “Dubai remains at the forefront for global investors, positioning Dubai as the world's premier real estate destination and a byword for innovation, trust, and happiness”.One of the most significant drivers of Dubai’s booming property sector has been the Golden Visa programme, which offers long-term residency to investors purchasing property worth at least AED 2 million. The programme has reshaped investor behaviour, with many now favouring long-term ownership over short-term speculation.According to a report1 by fäm Properties, Dubai’s real estate market has had a record-breaking year. The year 2024 was an all-time peak of a high of 180,900 transactions touching a whopping AED 522.1 billion. Firas Al Msaddi, CEO of fäm Properties, added that 2024 was a remarkable year for Dubai’s real estate market with a growth in transaction volumes, despite global economic uncertainties.He added sale values in fact, broke historical records with strong rental demands and high luxury resilience.Peter May, Chief Operating Officer at Silkhaus, believes Dubai’s appeal lies in its economic and political stability, coupled with its business-friendly environment. “Dubai stands out as a stable, business-friendly hub with strong leadership, security, and a tax-efficient environment, making it a haven for investors seeking long-term growth,” he says. “Unlike many other global cities that are saturated or struggling with over-regulation, Dubai continues to offer a fresh landscape where high-net-worth individuals can build their portfolios without excessive restrictions.”Apart from this Dubai's government has also launched ambitious urban development projects to enhance the city's appeal. The Real Estate Strategy 2033 aims to increase property transaction values to AED 1 trillion ($272 billion) within a decade. This plan focuses on creating upscale communities through public-private partnerships, ensuring a steady supply of luxury properties to meet growing demand.Dubai’s reputation has evolved from being a hub for GCC and Russian investors to attracting a more global clientele. Alois Kugendran, CEO of Amaya & Co Real Estate, has seen this first-hand, in a conversation with TOI.com, he said “Dubai’s reputation as a safe, stable destination with world-class infrastructure and long-term residency incentives is driving this trend,” he says. “We’re seeing more European and North American buyers than ever before. Many of them are relocating, drawn not just by investment opportunities but by the city’s lifestyle, tax benefits, and business potential.”A report2 by Colliers International notes that Dubai's real estate sector has witnessed a surge in investment from family offices seeking diversification and long-term returns.A Henley Private Wealth Migration Report3 2023, added close to 4,500 millionaires relocated to the UAE in the same year. Not only that, according to a report by DIFC, Dubai ranked 1st in the MEASA region and among the world’s top 22 cities in terms of wealthiest population centers in 2023 with over 68,500 HNWIs.His Excellency Essa Kazim, Governor, of DIFC said in the report - “Dubai and DIFC have rapidly positioned themselves as the premier destination for family businesses worldwide. The exponential growth and expertise witnessed within the Centre underscores its pivotal role in shaping the landscape of family wealth.” DIFC is also making strides to push an increase in technology and innovation in the real estate sector. The financial hub has launched a new technology solution that enables third parties to access data on its real estate landscape. The report added that the initiative will contribute to the Dubai Real Estate Sector Strategy 2033 which aims to increase transactions, attract international investors, and position Dubai as one of the foremost property investment destinations.According to the Savills Prime Residential World Cities Index4, Dubai prime residential capital values saw a 6.4% rise in 2025. This has cemented the emirate’s status as a top global investment hub. The report added that there is a growing population and influx of HNIs and family offices in the UAE fuelling a high demand for prime residential properties.It added that Dubai is evolving as a luxury segment that in fact, is redefining the market’s understanding of ‘prime’, with its multiple ultra-luxury projects. Indian investors continue to be among the top three nationalities purchasing luxury properties in Dubai, drawn by zero capital gains tax, ease of inheritance planning, and high ROI potential.For Indian investors, Dubai provides significantly more value per square foot than major cities like Mumbai and Delhi. “Many of our Indian clients tell us that buying in Dubai makes more financial sense than in their home market,” Kugendran said. “They get better infrastructure, higher ROI, and access to a market that continues to appreciate.”Branded residences have become a defining feature of Dubai’s luxury property boom, with partnerships between developers and global brands drawing in wealthy investors looking for exclusivity. “Branded residences—offering a blend of luxury, exclusivity, and hotel-style management—are in high demand,” said Kugendran. “They provide not just prestige, but also hassle-free returns, which is something investors value.”At the same time, short-term rental investments have become a key part of many investors' strategies. May has observed that UHNWIs are no longer just looking for properties to own—they are looking for ways to make their investments work for them. “Short-term rentals offer greater liquidity, allowing investors to sell properties without the constraints of long-term tenancy agreements,” he explains. “This flexibility makes them a strategic asset, enabling investors to adapt quickly to market conditions while maximising returns.”Kugendran believes that Dubai’s rental market is one of the strongest globally. “There’s a huge demand for luxury short-term rentals, whether it’s from high-net-worth travellers, executives, or digital nomads looking for extended stays,” he says. “The yields in Dubai’s prime locations consistently outperform traditional rental markets in cities like London and New York.”With the city’s real estate market seeing record-breaking transactions, prime locations such as Palm Jumeirah, Dubai Hills Estate, and Downtown Dubai have become some of the most valuable addresses in the world.H.E. Sultan Butti bin Mejren has highlighted Dubai's real estate sector's resilience and growth, he said, ”The strong performance in the real estate sector indicates a trend that we expect to be sustained over the next year and beyond.”5Developers are responding to the growing demand with more exclusive, low-density developments that prioritise privacy, space, and sustainability. Kugendran has noticed a strong interest in sustainability-driven properties. “Luxury buyers today want more than just a big house—they want eco-friendly designs, energy-efficient systems, and developments that offer wellness-focused living,” he says. “Sustainability is no longer a niche trend; it’s becoming a requirement for high-end buyers.” Knight Frank Sustainability in Real Estate Report added luxury real estate in Dubai is no longer just about opulence; it’s about sustainability, wellness, and environmental responsibility, which are becoming key decision factors for high-net-worth investors.6For investors, the appeal of Dubai’s real estate market is also no longer just about capital appreciation but also about strong rental yields. May sees this as a major shift in how UHNWIs are approaching their investments. “Both capital appreciation and rental income are moving in the same direction. Property values continue to rise, while rental demand—particularly for short-term rentals—is outpacing supply, driving higher yields and increased ROI potential,” he says. “What makes Dubai unique is that investors don’t have to choose between growth and income—they can have both.”Dubai’s luxury real estate market is no longer just a haven for second-home buyers—it has become a centre for long-term wealth preservation, business expansion, and high-yield investments. As a city that continually reinvents itself, it offers something few other real estate hubs can: stability, exclusivity, and a future-ready investment landscape. For UHNWIs, the question is no longer whether to invest in Dubai—it is how much of their portfolio they should allocate to it.Click this link for more on Business in Dubai.SourcesIt is a part of a featured content series on Business in Dubai.","According to a report1 by fäm properties, dubai’s real estate market has had a record-breaking year.

"As Trump cracks down on immigration, Singapore expands work visas for Indians",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/trump-pushes-gold-visa-but-singapore-expands-work-visas-for-indian-talent-with-smoother-path/articleshow/118763593.cms,"More job openings, longer employment

Higher salaries, expanded job sectors

A boost for Indian talent

Singapore is opening new doors for foreign workers, and for Indians, this could mean better job opportunities and longer career stability in the city-state. The ministry of manpower (MOM) has announced a series of policy changes that will allow employers to hire and retain skilled foreign talent more easily—benefiting Indian professionals and laborers alike.From July 1, Singapore is scrapping the maximum employment period for work permit holders. Previously, foreign workers could only stay for 14 to 26 years, depending on their sector and country of origin. This means Indian workers in construction, shipyards, and process industries will now have the opportunity for long-term employment without arbitrary limits.Additionally, the maximum age for employment is rising from 60 to 63, allowing experienced workers to stay longer. For new applicants, the age cap is also increasing to 61, up from 50. These changes will particularly help senior professionals and skilled laborers from India continue working in Singapore for extended periods.The reforms also bring better pay. The qualifying salary for S Pass holders—who perform specialized roles—will rise to SGD 3,300 (Rs 2.04 lakh) from September. For mid-career professionals in their 40s, salaries could go up to SGD 4,800 (Rs 3 lakh). In financial services, the qualifying salary is even higher, starting at SGD 3,800.Moreover, the range of jobs open to non-traditional sources like India is expanding. From September, roles such as cooks, heavy vehicle drivers, and manufacturing operators will be added to the list—offering more avenues for skilled Indian workers to enter Singapore’s job market.Singapore’s economy relies on a mix of local and foreign talent. As manpower minister Tan See Leng stated, restricting foreign workers would hurt businesses and limit opportunities for locals. Over the past decade, while foreign employment grew by 38,000, local professionals, managers, and executives saw an increase of 382,000.With these new measures, Indian professionals, skilled laborers, and businesses will have a stronger footing in Singapore, ensuring a steady flow of jobs and economic ties between the two nations.","From july 1, singapore is scrapping the maximum employment period for work permit holders. The maximum age for employment is rising from 60 to 63, allowing experienced workers to stay longer. Qualifying salary for s pass holders will rise to sgd 3,300 (rs 2.04 lakh) from september.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118765585,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-2569516,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Many miss H-1B lottery due to new norm in US firms,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/many-miss-h-1b-lottery-due-to-new-norm-in-us-firms/articleshow/118743534.cms,"Photo/Agencies

A continuous churn in visa policies in the US has pushed many Indians to the edge. In a recent move, several American companies have made it mandatory for those on an Optional Practical Training (OPT) to work with them for at least a year before then can sponsor their H-1B. Result: Many freshly-minted Indian graduates with new jobs - hoping to participate in the H-1B visa lottery this March - are now forced to sit out of the process.Incidentally, Indians comprise the largest group of H-1B visa applicants, making up nearly 72% of the lottery system's applications.OPT holders said this policy shift aimed at filtering employees who can commit for a longer time in the company has added to their uncertainty. ""I was hoping to file for the H-1B lottery this March. But now, my employer has made it clear that they will only sponsor employees who have completed one year with the company. I will have to wait until 2026 for my first attempt,"" said a Hyderabad-based techie who was hired in Nov 2024, after completing his master's in computer science.OPT is usually issued to students on F-1 to work for one year post completion of their education.While many new recruits have been contemplating switching jobs to escape the one-year rule, they admit that it isn't easy. ""Though I know I can make it for the March lottery if I move into a company that doesn't have this OPT rule, finding fresh employment is tough. Also, the visa transfer process isn't always straightforward,"" said another 25-year-old living in Los Angeles and working with a cybersecurity firm. She was hired in Oct 2024.The uncertainty is forcing many Indian students to make difficult choices - settle for lesser pay, junior profiles or just delay their plans of long-term work in the US.""A friend of mine switched companies just to get the H-1B sponsorship , but his current job is a downgrade from what he was doing before. The pay is as much as 20% less compared to what the earlier company was offering,"" said Rohan Shah, studying data analytics in New Jersey. Shah is now stressed about his chances of finding a job with a company ready to sponsor his H-1B immediately. ""What is the guarantee that they will sponsor after a year? And if they don't, where will we go? We will have to work odd jobs,"" he said.Another student from Bengaluru, currently working in Texas as a programme manager, said the shift in policy has left many students feeling vulnerable. ""It's almost like a trap - you work hard to get a job, but the very company that hires you now wants you to prove loyalty for a year before they'll sponsor your visa,"" he said.","Many freshly-minted indian graduates with new jobs - hoping to participate in the h-1b visa lottery this march - are now forced to sit out of the process.

Elon Musk questioned by Tesla shareholders as stock declines for sixth consecutive session: “share five things you did for Tesla shareholders this week…”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/share-five-things-you-did-for-tesla-shareholders-this-week-elon-musk-questioned-by-tesla-shareholders-as-stock-declines-for-sixth-consecutive-session/articleshow/118688836.cms,"Elon Musk called out by investors as Tesla’s stock struggles continue

“Please share five things you did for Tesla shareholders this week. Or are you working remotely? Asking for all of us.”

Tesla stock performance and financial concerns

Increased competition in the EV market from legacy automakers such as Ford, GM, and global competitors like BYD.

Production and delivery challenges, with supply chain disruptions affecting Tesla’s output.

Leadership distractions, as Musk continues to divide his attention across multiple ventures, raising concerns about Tesla’s long-term strategic direction.

Regulatory scrutiny over Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology and ongoing legal challenges related to product safety.

Elon Musk’s expanding commitments raise concerns

Tesla investors have expressed growing frustration as the company’s stock continues to decline, marking its sixth consecutive session of losses. Shareholders are increasingly holding CEO Elon Musk accountable, questioning his recent actions and decision-making. The backlash follows Musk’s controversial demand for U.S. federal employees to justify their salaries by listing five accomplishments each week—a strategy he previously implemented at Twitter. Now, investors are turning the tables, demanding to know what Musk has done for Tesla shareholders as the stock tumbles.The discontent highlights broader concerns over Musk’s leadership, particularly his divided focus across multiple ventures, including SpaceX, Neuralink, The Boring Company, and his latest role as the U.S. government’s ""efficiency czar."" The ongoing criticism has sparked debates about his commitment to Tesla, a company once celebrated as the frontrunner in the electric vehicle (EV) industry.Amid Tesla’s stock decline, shareholders have taken to Musk’s own social media platform, X (formerly Twitter), to air their grievances. Celebrity photographer Jerry Avenaim was among those calling out Musk, posting:Accompanying the post was a stock performance graph showing Tesla’s downward trend. The sarcastic remark directly referenced Musk’s demand that federal employees justify their roles with weekly accomplishment lists, which had drawn criticism from government workers.Tesla investors are now challenging Musk using his own words, asking him to justify his leadership as stockholders witness losses. The growing unrest among investors signals a shift in sentiment, as many once ardent supporters now express skepticism over Musk’s priorities and Tesla’s future.Tesla’s stock has faced significant volatility since the start of 2025, with sharp declines raising concerns among investors. While Musk remains a visionary figure in the tech and automotive industries, recent market performance suggests that investor confidence may be wavering.Several factors have contributed to Tesla’s stock drop, including:Market analysts have warned that Tesla’s declining stock could further erode investor confidence unless Musk reaffirms his commitment to the company’s growth and stability.One of the key points of contention among shareholders is Musk’s involvement in multiple ventures beyond Tesla. His leadership roles at SpaceX, Neuralink, The Boring Company, and X have raised questions about whether he is stretched too thin.Additionally, Musk’s new role as the U.S. government’s ""efficiency czar"" has sparked debate. Appointed under Donald Trump’s administration, Musk has been tasked with improving governmental operations. However, critics argue that this political involvement further diverts his focus from Tesla at a critical time.Musk’s controversial management style has also drawn criticism. His push for extreme work culture at Twitter, mass layoffs, and controversial statements on social media have led some investors to question whether similar turbulence could impact Tesla’s stability.","Elon musk called out by investors as tesla’s stock struggles continue to decline.
