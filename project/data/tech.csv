NEW DELHI: The constant rise in wind and solar power generation in India enabled the country to surpass Germany as the world’s third-largest generator of electricity from these sources in 2024, shows a report by global energy think-tank Ember.Though India’s generation capacity from wind and solar — 215 terawatt-hour (TWh) — in 2024 remained much lower than China, the largest generator of electricity from these sources (1,826 TWh), and the US, the second largest generator (757 TWh), it almost doubled over five years, reflecting no signs of slowing down of clean energy growth in the country despite it being a late entrant in these segments of renewables.The report released on Tuesday underlined that the increasing use of electricity for AI, data centres, electric vehicles and heat pumps is already contributing to global demand growth. “Combined, growing use of these technologies accounted for a 0.7% increase in global electricity demand in 2024, double what they contributed five years ago,” it said.The analysis found that the world reached a new milestone last year as all low-carbon sources — renewables and nuclear — provided nearly 41% of the world’s electricity generation in 2024, passing the 40% mark for the first time since the 1940s.In comparison, India generated 22% of its electricity from clean sources last year, with hydropower as the single largest contributor at 8% of the mix, while wind and solar made up 10%. “While India’s clean generation continues to grow, it remains below the global average, highlighting significant potential for further expansion,” the report said.Gobally, renewables were the main driver of overall growth, adding a record 858 TWh in 2024, 49% more than the previous high in 2022. Solar was the largest contributor for the third year running, adding 474 TWh last year. The report showed that solar was the fastest-growing power source (29%) for the 20th year in a row. Global solar generation, in fact, doubled in three years.“Solar power has become the engine of the global energy transition. Paired with battery storage, solar is set to be an unstoppable force. As the fastest-growing and largest source of new electricity, it is critical in meeting the world’s ever-increasing demand for electricity,” Ember’s managing director Phil MacDonald said.The analysis also found that, despite the rise in renewables, fossil generation saw 1.4% increase in 2024 due to surging electricity demand, pushing global power sector emissions up 1.6% to an all-time high.It noted that heat waves were the main driver of the rise in fossil generation, mainly through additional use of cooling. “Without these temperature effects, fossil generation would have risen by only 0.2%, as clean electricity generation met 96% of the demand growth not caused by hotter temperatures,” the report said.During severe heat waves across the plains (April-June) last year, India’s electricity demand rose 10.4% compared to the same period in 2023. Increased air conditioning as a result of hotter temperatures accounted for nearly a third of the increase.Overall, India’s electricity demand grew by 5% in 2024. Clean generation met 33% of the increase in electricity demand, with coal meeting the majority (64%). However, this was significantly lower than in 2023, when coal met 91% of the increase.","Wind and solar power generation in india enabled the country to surpass germany as the world’s third-largest generator of electricity from these sources in 2024.

No Yes

NEW DELHI: 'Make in India' is the mantra as global smartphone giants Apple and Samsung look to re-calibrate worldwide production to blunt the impact of Donald Trump's higher tariffs on China and Vietnam, when shipping to the US.Even though it is a logistical challenge with major customs and other regulatory efforts required, the issue is being addressed on an urgent basis to ensure that supplies to the US remain competitive.Also read: Flurry of exports as firms raced to beat Trump tariffs Apple, the world's biggest electronics seller, has started to use production at India's factories to ship iPhones to the US, with plans to drastically cut down exports from China. The decision is being taken as Trump has announced a 26% reciprocal tariff on Indian exports to the US, while it is 54% for China, including the 34% announced last week, and 46% for Vietnam.""India's factories will be increasingly used to ship only to the US. Demand in other markets such as Europe, Latin America and even Asia will now be catered to from the China factories.

The latter had acquired the assets of Wistron and Pegatron - both from Taiwan - over the past few years. ""If Apple does not go for developing all-new production zones in locations, such as the UAE and Saudi Arabia, or in Brazil - all of which have US tariffs of 10% - then there will be a significant expansion of capacity in India,"" the official said.Any such move will see major investments by both Foxconn and Tatas, which could see iPhone shipments to the US grow massively from the estimated $10 billion this fiscal. A lot will, however, depend on discussions between the US with other countries.In case of Samsung, the matter is equally serious as its manufacturing set-up in Vietnam has exports of around $55 billion. ""Samsung will find it better to ship from India at a duty of 26% than export from Vietnam. While this will be a temporary measure till the Vietnamese govt negotiates with the US, it adds a lot of importance to Make in India,"" the official added. Vietnam has proposed zero duty for US exports. Samsung's factory in Noida makes smartphones, including S25 and Fold.Sources said those negotiating Bilateral Trade Agreement (BTA) with the US are ""aware of these dynamics"" and plan to use them to extract maximum for India's global manufacturing goals.","'make in india' is the mantra as global smartphone giants apple and samsung look to re-calibrate worldwide production.

IIT-Madras develops ground-breaking wireless indoor mapping technology for disaster response,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iit-madras-develops-ground-breaking-wireless-indoor-mapping-technology-for-disaster-response/articleshow/120067775.cms,"NEW DELHI: Researchers at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras have developed a cutting-edge, real-time indoor mapping technology that can function effectively under any lighting or environmental conditions, with minimal reliance on pre-existing infrastructure. The innovation, named UbiqMap , holds transformative potential for disaster response and public safety missions.UbiqMap employs a technique called Radio Tomographic Imaging (RTI), which uses radio frequency (RF) signals to generate accurate floor maps of indoor environments. Unlike traditional RTI systems that depend on a fixed network of wireless transceivers, UbiqMap introduces a portable and dynamic system using wearable transceivers. These devices are worn by rescue personnel and automatically track movement and location, continuously updating the layout of the building in real time.“This technology addresses a crucial challenge in disaster management—access to accurate and up-to-date indoor maps, which are often unavailable or outdated during emergencies,” said Ayon Chakraborty, assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, who led the project. The research team also included MS student Amartya Basu and MTech student Kush Jajal.The system was tested successfully within controlled settings on the IIT-Madras campus, where it demonstrated reliable imaging of indoor spaces. The team is now working on enhancing the technology by balancing radio frequency choices for optimal resolution and indoor penetration, integrating visual inputs through sensor fusion, and developing a wearable prototype for real-world field trials.A patent has been filed for the technology, and the research has been peer-reviewed and published in the IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing.UbiqMap stands out among existing mapping solutions due to its independence from visual line of sight and low reliance on computing resources, making it particularly valuable in cluttered, poorly lit, or structurally compromised environments. It can also identify material properties of building components, aiding responders in route planning and safety assessments.Designed for affordability and adaptability, the technology can work in tandem with existing systems like cameras and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) tools, further enhancing its performance. By providing first responders with real-time situational awareness, UbiqMap is poised to become a vital tool in managing high-risk, time-sensitive operations.In future applications, the system could also benefit smart building management, indoor robotics, and warehouse navigation, offering scalable solutions for both emergency and commercial use cases.","Researchers at the indian institute of technology (iit) madras have developed a cutting-edge, real-time indoor mapping technology.

A generous move of Travis Kelce for Kansas City youth sparks debate on social media

Poll What do you admire most about Travis Kelce’s game? His clutch performances His powerful catches

Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce is no stranger to giving back, but his latest act of philanthropy is grabbing headlines for more than just its price tag. The tight end recently donated a $3.3 million home to Foster Love, a nonprofit working to support homeless youth in Kansas City.While many have applauded the move as a heartfelt gesture, the internet has exploded with speculation — with some fans claiming pop sensation Taylor Swift may have quietly financed Kelce's generous donation.The donation comes on the heels of a tough Super Bowl loss, but Travis Kelce’s influence off the field remains as powerful as ever. With a $17.1 million annual contract and an estimated net worth of $90 million, he’s got the financial means to make a serious impact. Still, not everyone is convinced the donation was purely altruistic.The controversy kicked off when fans began questioning the true origin of the funds. Some social media users speculated that Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce’s high-profile girlfriend, may have contributed — or even footed the entire bill. Theories range from Swift subtly backing the donation to the couple strategically making philanthropic moves to boost their public image. “Some fans assume that the singer paid,” read one line in a Marca report, igniting even more online chatter.Still, those close to the athlete say this isn’t out of character for him. Travis Kelce founded the Eighty-Seven & Running foundation in 2015, focusing on underserved youth in both Cleveland and Kansas City. In 2024 alone, he donated 25,000 meals to students in need — a far cry from a one-off publicity stunt.Many are calling the donation a “classy act” and a reflection of Kelce’s long-standing commitment to social good. Others, however, suggest the timing and optics are too calculated. Tax benefits have also entered the conversation, with critics speculating the move could be financially strategic.Also Read: “Bizarre visuals”: Taylor Swift emoji rumors spark chaos as viral tweet dupes iPhone users with fake Apple update Despite the noise, Kelce's track record speaks volumes.

New features for Copilot



Microsoft AI head, Mustafa Suleyman , recently spoke at the company’s 50th anniversary celebration about how Microsoft tracks the progress of its AI assistant , Copilot. He explained that his team measures things like daily and weekly users, how widely Copilot is being used, and how much people are engaging with it. However, Suleyman’s main focus is on something different. He said, “I really, really focus the team on SSR, the rate of successful sessions.”In the past, when customers didn’t give real-time feedback, companies measured success by how much time people spent using products, like on social media, or how many problems the product solved. “Now, we actually get to learn from the anonymized logs and extract the sentiment,” said Suleyman, who joined Microsoft a year ago after leading Inflection AI, a startup.Suleyman explained that Microsoft now uses an AI model to help figure out the sentiment behind users' interactions with Copilot. This helps measure SSR.“Over the last four months, it’s gone up dramatically, and that’s what we optimize for,” he added. He, however, didn’t share exact numbers or other specific metrics for Copilot’s performance.Last fall, Microsoft introduced a new, friendlier voice for Copilot and added a feature to analyze web pages for users. Recently, the company also showcased new features for Copilot, like personalized podcasts, a tool to help with researching tough questions, and the ability for Copilot to be customized to each person and conversation.When asked what he would like Copilot to look like, Suleyman said, “I would definitely go for something that was cutesy,” adding, “like a little Furby-type thing.”","Microsoft ai head mustafa suleyman recently spoke at the company’s 50th anniversary celebration.

From country roots to business mogul: How Taylor Swift built her billion-dollar empire

Taylor Swift has officially joined the elite club of billionaires in 2025, solidifying her status not just as a global pop phenomenon but also as a masterful businesswoman. According to Forbes’ latest World’s Billionaires list, Swift now boasts a net worth of $1.6 billion—largely thanks to her record-shattering Eras Tour and savvy control over her musical empire.While other stars like Oprah Winfrey, Kim Kardashian, and Rihanna made headlines for their ventures into beauty, fashion, and media, Taylor Swift’s rise is unique. She didn’t build her wealth through brand endorsements or business acquisitions alone—she did it with songwriting, performing, and reclaiming her artistry. Her 2023–2024 Eras Tour alone grossed over $2 billion across 149 shows in 21 countries, making it the highest-grossing tour in history.With 13 albums hitting No. 1—including “Reputation,” “Midnights,” and “1989 (Taylor’s Version)”—Swift’s music is not just topping charts but also generating massive revenue streams from sales, streaming, and licensing deals. Unlike many of her peers, Swift owns the masters of her re-recorded albums, giving her a larger slice of the financial pie than most artists ever see.Swift’s journey began in country music, but her evolution into a genre-blending global superstar came with equally strategic business acumen. Her re-recording campaign was not just a statement of artistic independence—it turned into a billion-dollar blueprint. Beyond music, Swift has leveraged her influence with precision, keeping endorsements minimal and instead turning her image into a brand of authenticity.In a testament to her character, Swift recently donated $5 million toward relief efforts for Hurricanes Milton and Helene, underscoring her belief in using wealth for meaningful impact.Even as billionaires like Kim Kardashian dominate fashion with SKIMS and Rihanna with Fenty Beauty, it’s Swift who is now being compared to moguls like Oprah and Jay-Z. Her business approach, built on integrity, ownership, and creativity, sets her apart.Also Read: Sadie Sink finally breaks silence on age-gap controversy in Taylor Swift's All Too Well short film In a list filled with actors, reality stars, and entrepreneurs, Swift remains a standout—proof that artistic integrity, combined with a relentless work ethic, can be just as powerful as boardroom deals.","Taylor swift has officially joined the elite club of billionaires in 2025.

Jeff Bezos purchased a $23 million Kalorama mansion in 2016.

Peter Thiel bought a $13 million beaux-arts residence in 2021.

Similarly, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt acquired a $15 million Georgetown home once occupied by Jacqueline Kennedy.

PayPal co-founder David Sacks, now a White House advisor, purchased a $10.3 million Northwest DC penthouse.

Former eBay executive Jeff Skoll spent $17 million on Virginia properties reportedly planned for a compound.

Mark Zuckerberg has become the latest tech billionaire to establish a presence in Washington DC, purchasing a $23 million mansion in the upscale Woodland Normanstone neighborhood, a report has said. The acquisition, confirmed by Facebook parent company Meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.Politico reports that for weeks, the identity of the buyer remained shrouded in mystery as real estate agents were bound by non-disclosure agreements. Shortly after the cash transaction closed in early March, images of the 15,000-square-foot property became pixelated on Google Maps, the report added.Neighborhood residents noted increased activity at the previously vacant home, coinciding with reports that Zuckerberg’s private jet had landed at Dulles Airport.The publication says that a Meta spokesperson confirmed the purchase, explaining: “Mark and Priscilla have purchased a home in DC, which will allow Mark to spend more time there as Meta continues the work on policy issues related to American technology leadership.”The official explanation cites convenience and safety during increased Washington visits. Notably, Zuckerberg also has properties in Palo Alto, Lake Tahoe and Hawaii, among other places.Although tech titans have acquired Washington properties even before Trump's return to office, the pace has reportedly accelerated significantly in the past year.","The acquisition, confirmed by facebook parent company meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.

Poll Is it ethical for tech companies to collaborate with military organizations? No, it promotes violence. Yes, it's part of national defense.

A former Microsoft employee ignited controversy during the company’s 50th anniversary celebration, confronting top executives including CEO Satya Nadella and former heads Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer. The employee, Vaniya Agrawal, an Indian-American software engineer, accused the tech giant of aiding violence in Gaza through its technologies.“Fifty thousand Palestinians in Gaza have been murdered with Microsoft technology. How dare you. Shame on all of you for celebrating on their blood,” she declared before being escorted out of the event. Neither Gates nor Nadella nor Ballmer responded to the outburst, choosing instead to continue their panel discussion.Agrawal, who has since resigned from the company, described Microsoft as a “digital weapons manufacturer” and condemned its alleged collaboration with the Israeli military. In a pointed critique, she called on Microsoft to end its ties with Israel, highlighting what she claimed was a $133 million agreement with Israel’s Ministry of Defense involving AI and Azure tools.In her resignation letter, Agrawal wrote, “I cannot, in good conscience, be part of a company that participates in this violent injustice,” and added, “If you must continue to work at Microsoft, I urge you to use your position, power, and privilege to hold Microsoft accountable to its own values and mission.”This isn’t the first time Microsoft employees have spoken out against the company's partnerships. Earlier, Ibtihal Aboussad, another staffer who also resigned, disrupted a session led by Mustafa Suleyman, Microsoft's AI CEO. She called him a “war profiteer,” accusing him and the company of enabling violence. “Microsoft technologies are being used to commit acts of genocide,” she alleged. Suleyman responded, “Thank you for your protest. I hear you.”Back in February, Nadella faced similar internal dissent when five employees were removed from a meeting after protesting Microsoft’s contracts with Israeli defense entities. The backlash has intensified in recent months as violence surged in Gaza following the breakdown of a ceasefire agreement with Hamas.","Vaniya agrawal, an indian-american software engineer, accused the tech giant of aiding violence in gaza through its technologies.
