NEW DELHI: Dr Krishnaswamy Kasturirangan, an eminent space scientist, educationist and the guiding force behind India’s space and education milestones, passed away on Friday in Bengaluru at the age of 84. A former chairman of the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) and the chief architect of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, Kasturirangan had been battling age-related ailments following a heart attack he suffered in Sri Lanka in July 2023. He breathed his last at 10:43 am at his Bengaluru residence.His mortal remains will be kept at the Raman Research Institute, Bengaluru, on April 27 for people to pay their respects. He is survived by two sons.Kasturirangan-led Isro from 1994 to 2003, a period marked by major milestones, including the operationalisation of the Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle and the successful flight-test of the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle. Under his stewardship, Isro pursued technological self-reliance and began planning ambitious missions such as Chandrayaan, despite facing international sanctions following India’s 1998 nuclear tests.PM Narendra Modi said, “I am deeply saddened by the passing of Dr K Kasturirangan, a towering figure in India's scientific and educational journey. His visionary leadership and selfless contribution to the nation will always be remembered.” He praised Kasturirangan’s pivotal role in elevating Isro and said India would always be grateful for his contributions to education.President Droupadi Murmu acknowledged his integral role in shaping both India’s space programme and the NEP.Education minister Dharmendra Pradhan remembered him as an “intellectual titan”, saying, “To me, he was far more than a mentor — he was a guiding light, a wellspring of wisdom, compassion, and quiet strength.”Science and technology minister Jitendra Singh called him “a visionary scientist and a guiding force behind India’s space programme”. Congress president Mallikarjun Kharge said he made significant contributions in India's space exploration and contributed in various positions in key policy making.Prior to heading Isro, Kasturirangan directed the Isro Satellite Centre and was responsible for overseeing development of next-generation satellites including INSAT-2 and IRS-1A & 1B. As project director for BHASKARA-I and II, India’s first experimental Earth observation satellites, he laid the groundwork for the nation’s remote sensing capabilities.An accomplished astrophysicist, Kasturirangan’s research spanned high-energy X-ray and gamma-ray astronomy. He played a key role in conceptualising India’s first space-based high-energy astronomy observatory and authored over 200 research papers in leading national and international journals. He also edited six books.After his illustrious space career, Kasturirangan pivoted to education policy and led the drafting committee of the NEP-2020, introducing a transformative vision for Indian schooling and higher education. Later, he spearheaded the development of the National Curriculum Framework.He had famously stated, “The vision of India’s new education system is to ensure that it touches each and every citizen's life and creates a just and equitable society.”Kasturirangan was awarded all three of India’s top civilian honours — Padma Shri (1982), Padma Bhushan (1992), and Padma Vibhushan (2000). He was also Member of Rajya Sabha (2003–09), Planning Commission member, National Institute of Advanced Studies director (2004–2009) and JNU chancellor.Born on Oct 24, 1940, in Ernakulam, Kerala, he earned his physics degree from Bombay University and his PhD in experimental high-energy astronomy from the Physical Research Laboratory, Ahmedabad.

Who’s still left in the 2025 NFL Draft? Top remaining players you can’t ignore on Day 2



2025 NFL Draft Full Round 1 Review

Shedeur Sanders

Will Johnson

Aireontae Ersery

Jalen Milroe

TreVeyon Henderson

Landon Jackson

The opening night of the 2025 NFL Draft in Green Bay delivered its fair share of fireworks. Cam Ward going first overall to the Tennessee Titans was a headline-grabber, while the Jacksonville Jaguars made a bold move to trade up for two-way sensation Travis Hunter . Not to be outdone, the Las Vegas Raiders invested in electric running back Ashton Jeanty. But even with 32 picks off the board, the draft is far from decided.As Round 2 looms large, there's a surprising amount of first-round-caliber talent still available, setting the stage for what could be an equally eventful Day 2.Among the biggest storylines is the stunning omission of Colorado quarterback Shedeur Sanders. The son of NFL Hall of Famer Deion Sanders, Shedeur entered the draft process with immense buzz and delivered under the brightest lights in college football. “Despite operating in a spotlight that might blind other passers, Sanders somehow managed to exceed outsized expectations by establishing himself as a precise and poised distributor.” His ability to read defenses and deliver timely throws is already NFL-ready. While his pocket presence under pressure remains a question, Sanders has the tools to thrive in a system that allows him to orchestrate rather than freelance. Teams needing a long-term starter would be wise not to let him slip further.Another surprising name still available is Michigan cornerback Will Johnson, who has drawn comparisons to reigning Defensive Player of the Year Pat Surtain II. “The comparisons to Pat Surtain II...are lofty but not outlandish.” Standing at 6'2"" and 194 pounds, Johnson offers elite size, fluidity, and awareness. A toe injury hindered his 2024 campaign, but his upside remains sky-high. He’s projected to be a future shutdown corner capable of shadowing elite wideouts.Meanwhile, the trenches haven’t been overlooked. Minnesota's Aireontae Ersery remains the best offensive tackle on the board. The Texans, after missing out on top linemen late in Round 1, could be in play here. At 6'6"" and 331 pounds, Ersery combines nimbleness with raw power. “His tools are worth developing,” making him a long-term left tackle solution for any pass-protection-needy team.In terms of explosiveness, few prospects rival Alabama’s Jalen Milroe. The dual-threat quarterback turned heads in 2023 as he led the Crimson Tide with 20 rushing scores and 16 through the air. With 71 total touchdowns across two seasons, Milroe is “perhaps the most dynamic dual-threat quarterback of the draft class.” If a team tailors its offense to his strengths, they might unlock one of the biggest steals of Day 2.Another offensive weapon to watch is TreVeyon Henderson of Ohio State. While his inside running needs refinement, “he has the burst to break long gains whenever he's given a crease.” A legitimate three-down back, Henderson’s pass protection and receiving ability make him an instant contributor.Defensively, Arkansas’ Landon Jackson brings intimidating length and energy off the edge. Though “his rigidity severely limits him in several phases,” his relentless motor and physical tools will appeal to teams looking for an edge presence with untapped upside.With so much high-level talent still in play, Day 2 of the NFL Draft promises intrigue, value picks, and possibly franchise-changing decisions.Also Read: Why the Patriots believe Will Campbell is the cornerstone their offensive line has desperately needed","With 32 picks left in the 2025 nfl draft, the draft is far from decided.

Shannon Sharpe Lawsuit: Who is Gabriella Zuniga? The OnlyFans star who sued Shannon Sharpe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/who-is-gabriella-zuniga-the-onlyfans-star-who-sued-shannon-sharpe/articleshow/120578272.cms,"Source - X

Gabriella Zuniga: The woman rumored to be behind the Shannon Sharpe lawsuit



Who is Gabriella Zuniga? A young model with a quiet online past until now

For weeks, the $50 million civil lawsuit against Shannon Sharpe featured a mystery woman simply referred to as “Jane Doe.” But now, internet detectives and a few hip-hop gossip outlets believe they’ve uncovered who she is. Enter Gabbi Zuniga , a 20-year-old OnlyFans model whose name is suddenly at the center of one of the most talked-about legal cases in sports media.Here’s everything we know so far about Zuniga, where this information is coming from, and why the internet believes she’s the woman behind the allegations.The name Gabbi Zuniga first started trending on Twitter and TikTok shortly after news of the Shannon Sharpe lawsuit broke. According to viral posts from hip-hop accounts like WorldStarHipHop , OnSite, and The Neighborhood Talk, Zuniga is being identified as the woman suing Sharpe for rape, emotional abuse, and secretly recording intimate moments.Here’s why the internet believes Gabbi Zuniga is the woman suing Shannon Sharpe: The lawsuit never names the accuser, identifying her only as “Jane Doe,” but social media detectives quickly connected the dots. Screenshots of flirty DMs allegedly linked to Gabbi’s accounts began circulating, and old OnlyFans clips, TikToks, and deleted Instagram posts reportedly showed her in spaces resembling Sharpe’s home or hotel rooms described in the suit.Though the court documents still list the accuser as “Jane Doe”, these online receipts have pushed Gabbi’s name into the spotlight. No one has confirmed this yet, but screenshots of Gabbi’s alleged texts and DMs with Sharpe are circulating online and multiple Reddit and X (formerly Twitter) threads claim she was spotted with Sharpe in LA..Before this legal case, Gabbi Zuniga wasn’t a household name. She reportedly ran a modest OnlyFans account, occasionally posted on TikTok, and goes by the name of @sheiskarli on Instagram. Users claim she previously worked in LA as a fitness model and met Sharpe at a West Hollywood gym in 2023 when she was 20.Now, her name is trending across social media, with hundreds of users analyzing her posts and reposting alleged clips of her and Sharpe together.In civil lawsuits like this especially involving sexual assault—plaintiffs often use the name “Jane Doe” to protect their identity. It’s legal and standard practice. But once the story hits the internet, things can spiral.Gabbi hasn’t publicly confirmed or denied her involvement in the case, and her social media pages are now locked or deleted. Still, the viral naming has led to real-life implications, with online trolls, fans, and media digging into her private life.Sharpe’s legal team, meanwhile, is still treating the case as involving “Jane Doe,” and neither side has commented directly on Gabbi Zuniga by name.Whether or not the internet got it 100% right, the name Gabbi Zuniga is now tied to one of the most explosive sports lawsuits of 2025. From anonymous accuser to viral figure, her identity reveal (or alleged reveal) has added even more layers of drama and speculation to an already chaotic story.Also read - Inside the Shannon Sharpe lawsuit: A full timeline of the sexual assault case, lawyers, leaked videos, and what comes next","The name gabbi zuniga first started trending on twitter and tiktok shortly after news of the shannon sharpe lawsuit broke.

As of April 2025, Bill Gates remains one of the wealthiest individuals in the world, continuing to exert global influence through both financial investments and philanthropic initiatives. Despite stepping away from his executive role at Microsoft over a decade ago and donating tens of billions to charitable causes, Gates maintains a net worth exceeding $100 billion. The co-founder of Microsoft and current chairman of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Gates has diversified his portfolio significantly over the years. His fortune is now driven largely by strategic investments managed through Cascade Investment LLC and bolstered by his legacy in the tech sector.According to the, Bill Gates' estimated net worth as of April 2025 stands at $104.6 billion, placing him at #14 on the global wealth rankings. This valuation accounts for a decade of large-scale philanthropy, including his landmark $20 billion donation to the Gates Foundation in 2022. Gates’ consistent presence in the upper echelon of the billionaire ranks is attributed to his diversified investment strategy and long-standing stake in Microsoft, even as his holdings in the company have decreased over time.At his peak, Gates held a dominant stake in Microsoft. However, since resigning from the company’s board in 2020, he has steadily reduced his ownership. By 2025, he owns less than 1% of Microsoft’s total outstanding shares. Despite the reduction, this still represents billions of dollars in value given Microsoft’s current market capitalization exceeding $2.5 trillion.A significant portion of Gates’ wealth is now managed through Cascade Investment LLC, a private investment firm he established with the help of financial advisor Michael Larson. Cascade’s portfolio spans multiple sectors, including:These diversified holdings have allowed Gates to reduce dependency on tech and ensure long-term financial stability.Bill Gates no longer earns from corporate salaries or direct product revenues. Instead, his wealth is sustained through:Though he spends much of his time on philanthropic work, his investments continue to generate substantial returns, ensuring his net worth remains in the multi-billion-dollar range.While Gates was once the richest person in the world, he has since been surpassed by tech entrepreneurs such as Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos, who currently have estimated net worths between $200 billion and $300 billion. However, Gates still ranks higher than:Gates’ lower rank is largely due to his extensive charitable giving, but his wealth still surpasses many current tech executives and CEOs.Gates has donated more than $59 billion to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, making it the largest private philanthropic organization in the world. The foundation focuses on:The 2022 donation of $20 billion marked a major milestone in Gates’ ongoing pledge to give away the majority of his fortune.Gates is also a co-founder of The Giving Pledge, a global movement encouraging billionaires to commit at least half their wealth to charitable causes during their lifetimes. He has stated publicly that his children will inherit only a modest portion of his wealth, emphasizing values of self-reliance and service.Unlike many billionaires who invest heavily in luxury items or space travel, Gates is known for a relatively modest lifestyle. His primary residence is a technologically advanced mansion known as Xanadu 2.0 in Medina, Washington, estimated to be worth over $130 million. The 66,000-square-foot estate features:He also owns farmland across the U.S. and a collection of classic cars, but his lifestyle reflects more practicality than extravagance.In 2025, Bill Gates continues to be a central figure in global conversations surrounding:Gates frequently publishes reports, appears at international summits, and collaborates with governments and NGOs to support large-scale initiatives. Though he no longer holds a corporate title, his influence in both philanthropy and technology remains substantial.","Bill gates' estimated net worth as of april 2025 stands at $104.6 billion, placing him at #14 on the global wealth rankings.

"‘We don’t push, spam or track’, claims Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath as he calls other apps ‘unusable’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/we-dont-push-spam-or-track-claims-zerodha-ceo-nithin-kamath-as-he-calls-other-apps-unusable/articleshow/120588805.cms,"Here’s what Nithin Kamath wrote on X

Most apps today have become unusable. They bombard users with irritating notifications, spam messages, and dark patterns, and many are downright scammy.

Without your knowledge, numerous apps on your phone track and harvest extensive data: which apps you've installed, how you use them, the content of your emails and SMS, media on your device, and more.

What's truly disturbing is that some apps track usage not just within their own environment but across other apps too. This means your most personal data is being harvested without your consent and sold to companies for shady targeting purposes.

At @zerodhaonline, we're different. We only request app permissions that are genuinely necessary for functionality. We don't send unnecessary push notifications, messages, or emails. We don't peddle useless financial products or push you to trade for the sake of ""engagement.""

Not doing unto others what we don't want done unto us is deeply rooted in our philosophy.

Barron Trump's new photo has shocked those who have been following the closely guarded life of the President's youngest son as in the photos exclusively published by Daily Mail, Barron Trump looks different -- disheveled and somewhat plump in comparison to his usual sharp appearances. DailyMail described the look as 'pragmatic' as Barron was sporting a polo shirt and khakis when he was snapped on his way out of the New York University. He was looking more like his dad in his younger days, the report noted.The photos revealed that Barron Trump has changed his hairstyle and now wears it more naturally -- instead of his combed, polished look.Barron Trump is continuing his life in New York and not in Washington as he has his college to attend, though he does not have much of a social life in college. He is not allowed to give his phone number to anyone in the college and so he communicates with his friends via different gaming platforms, it was reported. Discord, Xbox are his outlets to reach out to his peeps, reports said. ""He has added it to his repertoire,"" a source told Page Six.""It's his communication platform of choice.""He can't give anyone his number to minimize the probability of his number getting leaked. ""If people get the number, they would give it out and then a million people would be calling non stop,"" the Page Six report cited one saying. ""You'd have to change the number constantly and it'd become a merry-go-round,"" they added.Barron instead gives his gaming usernames and so far this has been a safe form of communication.Barron is a tech geek, as his father recently revealed and went on to say that Barron's future may lie in technology. ""I turn off his laptop, I said, ""Oh good"" and I go back five minutes later, he's got his laptop. I said, ""How'd you do that?""'

LONDON: The UK government and Italian energy company Eni Thursday announced a deal to create a major carbon capture and storage network to store millions of tonnes of CObeneath the Irish Sea.Prime Minister Keir Starmer set out the deal at an energy summit in London.""Earlier today, we finalised a deal with Eni, it will see them award £2 billion ($2.6 billion) in supply chain contracts for the high net carbon capture and storage project, creating 2,000 jobs across north Wales and the North West,""Eni said it had reached ""financial"" closure with the UK government's department of energy security and net zero for the Liverpool Bay carbon capture and storage project.The agreement would allow the project ""to move into the construction phase, unlocking key investments in supply chain contracts,"" it added.The Labour government said in October it plans to invest nearly £22 billion over 25 years to develop carbon capture and storage in two former industrial regions of northern Britain, to help the nation reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050.The government did not specify the exact amount that will be allocated to the Eni project.The country was launching a ""whole new clean energy industry for our country, carbon capture and storage"" to ""revitalise our industrial communities"", energy secretary Ed Miliband said.CCS is a technology that seeks to eliminate emissions created by burning fuels for energy and from industrial processes.The carbon is captured from emissions from industrial sites such as power plants, cement plants and blast furnaces and stored permanently in various underground environments.Eni plans to store 4.5 million tonnes of COper year, a quantity that could rise to 10 million after 2030, equivalent to the emissions of four million cars.Although complex and costly, the CCS solution is supported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), particularly as a way of reducing the footprint of industries that are difficult to decarbonise, such as cement and steel, in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming.Environmental non-governmental organisations, however, have criticised the UK's huge investment in the sector, calling for a focus on renewable energies.Parliament's Public Accounts Committee in February also raised concerns, describing the ""government's backing of unproven, first-of-a-kind technology"" to reach net zero as ""high-risk"".According to the International Energy Agency, the world's total COcapture capacity currently stands at only 50.5 million tonnes per year. This represents 0.1 percent of the world's annual total emissions.","Uk, italy's eni unveil deal on carbon capture project on irish sea.

SEOUL: Chinese artificial intelligence app DeepSeek was transferring personal data to a cloud services platform without users' consent while it was still available for download, South Korea 's data protection authority said on Thursday.The Personal Information Protection Commission ( PIPC ) said the information, which included device, network, and user inputs in AI prompts, was transferred to servers at Beijing platform Volcano Engine .DeepSeek's R1 chatbot stunned investors and industry insiders in January with its ability to match the functions of its Western competitors at a fraction of the cost.However, countries including South Korea, Italy and Australia and some US states have questioned DeepSeek's storage of user data and have banned or restricted its use.The PIPC launched an investigation in February and said DeepSeek would no longer be available for download until a review of its personal data collection practices was completed.""Initially, DeepSeek transferred personal data to companies located in China and the United States without obtaining users' consent or disclosing this in the privacy policy at the time the service was launched,"" commission official Nam Seok told reporters.""In particular, it was confirmed that DeepSeek transferred not only device, network, and app information, but also user inputs in AI prompts to Volcano Engine,"" he said.Following the investigation, DeepSeek ""acknowledged it had insufficiently considered Korea 's data protection laws, expressed its willingness to cooperate with the commission, and voluntarily suspended new downloads from domestic app markets"", Nam said.DeepSeek did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

TOKYO : The first foreigner tapped to head 7-Eleven expressed confidence Friday the Japanese convenience store chain will continue to attract thrifty customers, even in an economic slowdown.But Stephen Hayes Dacus , an American with a Japanese mother, declined to comment on the specifics of the various investment plans now being studied, including an acquisition proposal by Alimentation Couche-Tard of Canada.A special company committee, which he isn't part of, is charged with studying the options ""totally objectively,"" he said.""The process is moving forward very constructively,"" Dacus, who is currently a director, told a small group of reporters at the Tokyo headquarters of Seven & i Holdings Co., which operates 7-Eleven.His appointment as chief executive still needs shareholders' approval, set for May. Seven & i shares have risen more than 2% in the past year.Fluent in Japanese and English, Dacus said he was determined to build a culture of leadership that he's learned to admire from his experience working at Walmart, Uniqlo and other retailers.""If you're not humble, you're not listening to your customers. You're not learning. But if you're not aggressive, you're going to get beat by your competitors,"" he said.Dacus stressed the 7-Eleven chain was growing globally. But the stores were different by nation, and his intent was not to duplicate everywhere the Japanese-style "" conbini ,"" as they are known here.Lowering costs can be delivered with a better supply chain, for instance, leveraging the chain's global reach, while a cheaper recipe for a food item will merely drive customers away, said Dacus.""This business in Japan has been built on innovation,"" he said.While declining to comment on US President Donald Trump's policies, he acknowledged buyers will likely tighten their purse strings in a slowdown.The answer is to be the first choice for where they shop, Dacus said, noting that his mother and Japanese relatives he watched growing up never wasted anything. They would wrap leftover dinner rolls at restaurants in paper to take home, he recalled.""If you want to talk to some tough customers, you go talk to my aunts,"" he said.""Japanese customers are incredibly demanding.

India’s GDP growth outlook trimmed to 6.3% as private investment stalls and US tariffs loom: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-gdp-growth-outlook-trimmed-to-6-3-as-private-investment-stalls-and-us-tariffs-loom-report/articleshow/120613489.cms,"AI-generated image

India’s economy is expected to grow at a slower pace in the current fiscal year, weighed down by subdued private sector investment and uncertainty surrounding American tariffs, according to a Reuters survey of economists.The fifth-largest economy in the world is projected to expand at an average rate of 6.3 per cent in FY2024 -25, based on a poll conducted from April 15-24 with participation from 54 economists. While this matches last year’s growth, it marks a slight downgrade from the 6.5 per cent forecast in a March survey. It still remains marginally above the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) recent projection of 6.2 per cent.However, this represents a significant drop from the 9.2 per cent GDP growth recorded in fiscal year 2023–24, highlighting a slowdown in momentum.Economists say the headline figures mask deeper structural issues, including the economy’s inability to generate enough high-paying jobs for its growing youth population. Despite government-led infrastructure investments, private sector capital expenditure has remained stagnant over the past decade, leaving India operating below its potential.The situation is further complicated by the proposed 26 per cent US tariff on Indian imports - currently suspended for a 90-day window starting April 10 — which has raised concerns despite India’s services-heavy exports to the US.“Middle-class Indians are struggling. Residential building sales, passenger vehicles, and two-wheeler sales have declined. It’s important that domestic policies address the root causes,” said Kunal Kundu, India economist at Société Générale.“India needs a 1991 moment,” he added, referencing the landmark liberalisation campaign led by then-finance minister Manmohan Singh. “The tariff war offers a perfect opportunity to push for structural reforms. Without them, even as the fastest-growing large economy in a low global growth environment, India may fall well short of its long-term ambition to become a developed nation.”In the survey, most economists said US tariffs have had a negative or severely negative impact on business sentiment. Some described the effect as neutral.“Business sentiment has certainly taken a hit — no business wants to make investment decisions in an uncertain and volatile environment. Investment is the most adversely affected component of the economy due to trade tariffs,” said Kanika Pasricha, chief economic advisor at Union Bank of India.She added that sectors previously poised for growth — including renewables, refineries, steel, and cement — may now scale back or delay capital expenditure plans.Meanwhile, with concerns of a potential US recession and India’s consumer inflation staying below the 4 per cent medium-term target for two straight months, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to continue its moderate rate-cutting cycle. The central bank is likely to reduce rates by 25 basis points in June to 5.75 per cent, and possibly conclude the easing cycle in August at 5.50 per cent, according to the survey.“The unexpected drop in inflation... has created greater scope for monetary policy support to growth,” noted Dhiraj Nim, economist at ANZ.For FY2024–25, consumer inflation is projected to average 4.0 per cent, rising slightly to 4.3 per cent in the following fiscal year.This report based on Reuters survey comes days after the World Bank revised its prediction on India's growth to 6.3 per cent for FY 2025-26, cut from its previous estimate of 6.7 per cent.According to the report, as quoted by news agency PTI, ""In India, growth is expected to slow from 6.5 per cent in FY2024-25 to 6.3 per cent in FY 2025-26, as the benefits to private investment from monetary easing and regulatory streamlining are expected to be offset by global economic weakness and policy uncertainty.""The organisation's assessment indicates that India's current fiscal performance fell short of projections, primarily due to reduced private sector investments and unfulfilled public capital expenditure objectives.Read more: World Bank cuts India’s FY26 growth forecast to 6.3% citing global headwinds",The fifth-largest economy in the world is projected to expand at an average rate of 6.3 per cent in fy2024 -25.

Insourcing: 'Mid-mkt' centres drive GCC boom,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/insourcing-mid-mkt-centres-drive-gcc-boom/articleshow/120633737.cms,"HYDERABAD: India's mid-market GCCs ( global capability centres ) are experiencing a surge, outshining their peers by unlocking new opportunities. This growth is creating a flywheel effect, allowing them to leverage a diverse talent pool. India has over 480 mid-market GCCs, with 2.1 lakh employees, as shown in a Nasscom-Zinnov report.Mid-market GCCs are capability centres set up by mid-sized firms with annual revenue ranging from $100 million to $1 billion. They represent 27% of all GCCs and 22% of total units in the country. In the last five years, more than 110 new facilities were set up, representing approximately 35% of all new GCC units in India within this period.About 60% of end-to-end platform ownership in enterprise portfolios is driven from India by mid-market GCCs. Significant work is being done across AI/ML, cybersecurity, cloud, and data science. India hosts 47% of global product management talent and 25% of the deeptech workforce for mid-market GCCs.Pari Natarajan, CEO and co-founder of global management company Zinnov, said that in mid-market companies, private equity ownership plays a significant role.These private equity firms implement structured value creation strategies, with India-based GCCs being a crucial component. ""When such centres don't exist, establishing them becomes a strategic board-level directive. For mid-market firms without private equity backing, the push towards India centres comes from board members who serve as operational leaders,"" he said.North American firms, the report said, show a higher propensity to globalise, and India becomes an ideal destination given the learning agility and depth in the talent.
