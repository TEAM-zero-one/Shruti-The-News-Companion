US President Donald Trump on Friday announced a 100% tariff on pharma products, along with 50% on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, 30% on upholstered furniture and 25% on heavy trucks starting on October 1.The announcements came in a series of posts on his social media platform indicating that he remains committed to tariffs beyond the trade frameworks and import taxes introduced in August.""Starting October 1st, 2025, we will be imposing a 100% Tariff on any branded or patented Pharmaceutical Product, unless a Company IS BUILDING their Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Plant in America. 'IS BUILDING' will be defined as, 'breaking ground' and/or 'under construction',"" he said in a post on Truth Social.""There will, therefore, be no Tariff on these Pharmaceutical Products if construction has started. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" he added.Announcing the tariffs on trucks, he said, ""In order to protect our Great Heavy Truck Manufacturers from unfair outside competition, I will be imposing, as of October 1st, 2025, a 25% Tariff on all “Heavy (Big!) Trucks” made in other parts of the World. Therefore, our Great Large Truck Company Manufacturers, such as Peterbilt, Kenworth, Freightliner, Mack Trucks, and others, will be protected from the onslaught of outside interruptions.We need our Truckers to be financially healthy and strong, for many reasons, but above all else, for National Security purposes!""""We will be imposing a 50% Tariff on all Kitchen Cabinets, Bathroom Vanities, and associated products, starting October 1st, 2025. Additionally, we will be charging a 30% Tariff on Upholstered Furniture. The reason for this is the large scale 'FLOODING' of these products into the United States by other outside Countries. It is a very unfair practice, but we must protect, for National Security and other reasons, our Manufacturing process. Thank you for your attention to this matter!"" he said.Trump has argued that tariffs will encourage domestic investment, dismissing concerns that higher import taxes raise costs for consumers and businesses.He claimed inflation was under control, despite the consumer price index rising 2.9% over the past year. There was also little evidence that tariffs were creating jobs or new manufacturing facilities, with manufacturers cutting 42,000 jobs and builders reducing 8,000 since April.","Us president donald trump on friday announced a 100% tariff on pharma products, along with 50% on kitchen cabinets and bathroom vanities, 30% on upholstered furniture and 25% on heavy trucks.

Firms will cut H-1B workers



Impact on startups







The Donald Trump administration’s sharp increase in visa fees for H-1B workers has triggered concern among US technology companies, with many considering moving more jobs overseas — the very outcome the policy aimed to prevent.US President Donald Trump announced on Friday a steep $100,000 levy for new H-1B applicants, a visa program long used by tech firms to recruit skilled workers and by international students seeking US employment after postgraduate studies.While the fee applies only to new applicants and not current visa holders, confusion around its rollout and cost has prompted companies to pause hiring and adjust workforce plans.“I have had several conversations with corporate clients … where they have said this new fee is simply unworkable in the US, and it's time for us to start looking for other countries where we can have highly skilled talent,” said Chris Thomas, immigration attorney at Colorado-based law firm Holland & Hart, as quoted by Reuters.“And these are large companies, some of them household names, Fortune 100 type companies, that are saying, we just simply cannot continue.”Previously costing employers only a few thousand dollars, the new $100,000 fee flips the equation, making hiring talent in countries like India, where wages are lower and Big Tech increasingly builds innovation hubs, more attractive.“We probably have to reduce the number of H-1B visa workers we can hire,” said Sam Liang, co-founder and CEO of AI meeting assistant startup Otter.ai.“Some companies may have to outsource some of their workforce — hire maybe in India or other countries just to walk around this H-1B problem,” he added.“Blanket rulings like this are rarely good for immigration,” said Deedy Das, partner at Menlo Ventures, which has invested in startups including AI firm Anthropic.“For larger companies, the cost is not material. For smaller companies, those with fewer than 25 employees, it's much more significant. Big tech CEOs expected this and will pay. For them, fewer small competitors is even an advantage. It’s the smaller startups that suffer most,” he added, as reported by Reuters.Analysts warn the policy could reduce the number of talented immigrants who often go on to launch new firms. A 2022 report from the National Foundation for American Policy found that more than half of US startups valued at $1 billion or more had at least one immigrant founder.","Us president donald trump announced on friday a steep $100,000 levy for new h-1b applicants.

$100,000 H-1B visa fee







Amid the ongoing row over H-1B, Senator Eric Schmitt said he came across numerous examples of hospitals, universities and other employers hiring foreign H-1B workers as DEI staffing. Diversity, equity and inclusion of US companies ensure increased representation of underrepresented groups, while H-1B is an employment program based on skill. But Schmitt alleged that companies have been using the H-1B pool to fill DEI positions.As the Senator wrote to the USCIS to look into the matter, he cited examples of Yale New Haven Health which filed LCA for H-1B visas for the role of a DEI specialist in 2021.""Examples range from large banks and law firms to universities, healthcare systems, and even municipal park districts. Obviously, DEI positions are plainly non-technical and ideological in nature, and appear to fall outside the “speciality occupation” intent of the H-1B statute,"" the Senator wrote.""More to the point, in light of everything we know about DEI, it's alarming that American employers appear to be importing foreign workers to work in these roles — placing non-Americans in positions where they are tasked with policing the speech and thought of our own citizens.""DEI is a toxic and anti-American institution, Schmitt said, adding that DEI's marriage with H-1B is ""beyond the pale"".""Rather than recruiting genuinely exceptional top-level talent, in many cases the H-1B visa is now regularly used to staff middle management bureaucracies. Rather than 160+ IQ rocket scientists, it's being used to import HR managers, customer service representatives, and so on.""The Donald Trump administration, since the beginning, vowed to overhaul the H-1B program that allows tech companies to hire STEM graduates from other countries. Over the years, the program earned a bad name of stealing US jobs as hiring foreigners, notwithstanding their skill, became cheaper. The Trump administration hiked the fee to $100,000 which the tech companies will have to pay for hiring H-1Bs.","Senator eric schmitt writes to uscis to investigate if h-1bs have been hired to fill dei positions.

New AI agent 'Quick' signals strategic shift





Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman delivered a pointed message to staff during an internal meeting, criticizing the cloud computing giant for slow product rollouts ahead of its flagship Reinvent conference in December. ""The first and very most important thing we've got to do is make sure that we deliver on the roadmap that we have,"" Garman told employees, according to a meeting transcript reviewed by Reuters.The AWS chief emphasized that customers expect immediate access to announced products rather than mere pre-announcements. ""Increasingly, we're finding that when we launch innovative new things at Reinvent it's valuable if we can actually launch them, as opposed to just pre-announce them,"" Garman said during the all-hands meeting.The internal critique comes as Amazon grapples with mounting criticism over its artificial intelligence strategy. During the company's most recent earnings call, a Morgan Stanley analyst questioned CEO Andy Jassy about Wall Street concerns that ""AWS is falling behind in genAI with concerns about share loss to peers.""Jassy defended Amazon's position in an unusually lengthy eight-minute response, arguing that AI development remains in early stages with room for multiple winners.However, the internal pressure from Garman suggests ongoing urgency within the organization to accelerate product delivery timelines.At the meeting, Garman demonstrated a new internal AI product called ""Quick,"" per Reuters, describing as an ""agentic"" AI system designed to perform tasks with minimal prompting. The tool can analyze documents and web pages while automating customized workflows for regular business processes.Quick will soon be available for testing across all AWS employees, representing the company's latest effort to compete in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.

Israeli military transfers data as Microsoft cuts access





Microsoft has cut off cloud computing and AI services to an Israeli military intelligence unit after an investigation revealed the technology was being used for mass surveillance of Palestinian civilians. The tech giant made the decision following a Guardian investigation that exposed how Israel's Unit 8200 stored millions of intercepted Palestinian phone calls on Microsoft's Azure platform.Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and vice chair, announced the termination in an internal memo to employees, stating the company found ""evidence that supports elements of The Guardian's reporting."" The blocked services include cloud storage and AI technologies that Unit 8200 had used to collect and analyze up to ""a million calls an hour"" from Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.An Israeli security official downplayed the impact, telling CNN there is ""no damage to the operational capabilities of the IDF."" Neither the Israel Defense Forces nor the Ministry of Defense responded to requests for comment about the service termination.The No Azure for Apartheid group, which includes of Microsoft employees, had been pressured Microsoft for over a year through protests and demonstrations, called the decision a significant win.""Today's news is a significant and unprecedented win for the campaign and our organizing,"" said Hossam Nasr, an organizer with the group, noting Microsoft became ""the first US tech company to stop the sale of some technologies to the Israeli military since the start of the genocide in Gaza. ""However, the activist group said the action doesn't go far enough, as Microsoft only disabled services to a single unit while ""the vast majority of Microsoft's contract with the Israeli military remains intact."" The group vowed to continue organizing until all their demands are met.The company said it applies its anti-surveillance principles globally and has maintained this stance for over two decades, with Smith noting that customer privacy commitments prevented Microsoft from accessing the surveillance data directly during its investigation.Intelligence sources told the Guardian that Unit 8200 quickly moved the massive data trove out of Microsoft's Dutch servers within days of the original investigation's publication in August. The unit reportedly plans to transfer the surveillance data to Amazon Web Services, though Amazon has not responded to requests for comment.Smith emphasized that Microsoft ""does not provide technology to facilitate mass surveillance of civilians"" and noted the decision doesn't affect the company's broader relationship with Israel, including cybersecurity work.

US To Abandon H1-B Visa Lottery System, Trump Floats More Changes To Rules | Detailed Report

Policy should attract global talent while protecting wages







Box CEO Aaron Levie is pushing back against President Trump's $100,000 H-1B visa fee, warning the policy will give large tech companies an unfair advantage over cash-strapped startups in the competition for global talent. Speaking on ""The A16z Podcast"" alongside Andreessen Horowitz partners, Levie argued that the steep fee structure essentially turns international hiring into ""a spending game"" that smaller companies cannot win. The new policy, which takes effect September 21, represents a dramatic jump from current fees of $2,000 to $5,000.The Box CEO endorsed a significantly lower $20,000 fee proposed by Khosla Ventures' Keith Rabois, saying this amount wouldn't prevent smaller companies from competing for skilled workers. Startup founders have already told Business Insider that Trump's fee could ""kneecap their hiring in the talent wars,"" sending international workers to Big Tech companies that can more easily absorb the costs.The concerns extend beyond Silicon Valley's startup ecosystem. Billionaire investor Michael Moritz, whose portfolio includes Google and PayPal, has warned the policy could backfire by pushing tech innovation overseas, as skilled engineers can now work remotely from countries like India and Eastern Europe.Beyond the fee structure, Levie outlined a broader six-point framework for H-1B reform. He called for flexible visa caps that respond to actual talent availability, potentially ranging from 5,000 to 80,000 visas annually. ""There's not a fixed number of the world's best talent,"" he explained.His proposal emphasizes attracting ""the absolute best in the world"" while ensuring H-1B programs lift rather than suppress American wages. Levie warned against excluding junior-level international talent, citing examples like state school Master's graduates becoming AI engineers as ""positive sum"" contributors to the economy.The debate highlights broader questions about America's competitive edge in attracting global talent, particularly given that successful immigrant executives like Microsoft's Satya Nadella and Google's Sundar Pichai have become symbols of the H-1B program's potential benefits.","Box ceo aaron levie is pushing back against president trump's $100,000 h-1b visa fee.

'I Don't Agree With Him': Trump Opposes Starmer's Push For Palestinian Statehood

What is the digital ID plan?



Who will be eligible?



How will the application process work?



Why is the digital ID being introduced now?



Opposition and public reaction



Current identification methods



What’s next?







UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday unveiled plans to introduce a free digital ID system for all nationals and residents, aiming to curb illegal immigration and simplify access to government services, according to an official statement. .The government said the new digital ID, which will be stored on users’ smartphones, will streamline applications for services such as driving licences, childcare, welfare, and tax records. While individuals will not be required to carry or present the ID routinely, it will be “mandatory as a means of proving your right to work,” the statement added.Starmer explained the move will help prevent those without legal status from securing employment, thereby cutting off a key incentive for illegal migration. “This will stop those with no right to be here from being able to find work, curbing their prospect of earning money, one of the key 'pull factors' for people who come to the UK illegally,” the government said.Here is what you need to know about the government’s digital ID initiative:The new digital ID will be an app or digital credential stored on individuals’ smartphones. It will serve as a secure, government-backed proof of identity to access a range of services - from applying for driving licences and childcare benefits to accessing welfare and tax records.While the ID will not be compulsory to carry or show routinely, it will be mandatory to prove the right to work in the UK. This aims to prevent employers from hiring workers who lack legal permission to work, thereby reducing illegal employment.Starmer described the digital ID as an “enormous opportunity for the UK” and said it will provide “countless benefits” to ordinary citizens while helping the government enforce immigration laws more effectively.The digital ID will be available to all UK nationals and legal residents, including foreign nationals living in the country. The government emphasised inclusivity, pledging that the system will accommodate those without smartphones, such as the elderly or homeless.Details on the application process will be shaped by a forthcoming public consultation planned for later this year. The government has promised to engage with groups who might face challenges using digital services, ensuring the system is user-friendly and accessible to all.The UK has traditionally resisted introducing national ID cards, with the Conservative government scrapping a previous voluntary identity card system in 2011 established under Tony Blair’s administration. However, the current government views digital ID as a modern solution to immigration and public service access challenges.Illegal immigration remains a politically sensitive issue, and Starmer faces pressure from within his own Labour Party to address it effectively ahead of the party’s annual conference.Opposition voices have been critical. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said on social media that her party would “oppose any push… to impose mandatory ID cards on law-abiding citizens,” stressing that British people should not be forced into such a system.The Liberal Democrats also rejected the plan, arguing they ""cannot support a mandatory digital ID where people are forced to turn over their private data just to go about their daily lives.""Nigel Farage, leader of the hard-right Reform UK party - which polls predict could play a key role in the next government - voiced strong opposition, saying, ""I do not see a single benefit to the government having digital ID other than them controlling what we do, what we spend and where we go.""At present, UK citizens rely on passports, driving licences, and utility bills as forms of identification, depending on the situation. The digital ID aims to unify these disparate proofs into a single, streamlined digital identity.The government will soon launch a public consultation to gather feedback on the digital ID service, including from digitally excluded groups. Officials highlighted that lessons will be drawn from other countries with similar systems to ensure accessibility and privacy protections.(With inputs from agencies)","Uk prime minister keir starmer on friday unveiled plans to introduce a free digital id system for all nationals and residents.

Kido operates 18 sites in and around London, with additional locations abroad.It operates 39 nurseries across India, additional locations in China, and nine sites in the US, six in Houston, two in Austin, and one in Chicago, as per the Daily Mail.The cybercriminals are reportedly using the sensitive data, which also includes information about the children’s parents, carers, and safeguarding notes, to demand a ransom.Cybersecurity firm Check Point described the targeting of nurseries as ""an absolute new low.""The cybercriminals reached out to the BBC regarding the hack and have since posted details on their darknet website.They shared a sample of the stolen data, including pictures and profiles of 10 children. The release is part of their attempt to extort money from the nursery chain, which operates 18 locations, primarily in the London area.When asked if they felt any remorse for extorting a nursery using children’s data, the hackers responded that they ""weren't asking for an enormous amount"" and that they ""deserve some compensation for our pentest,"" as reported by the BBC.A ""pentest,"" or penetration test, refers to when ethical hackers are hired to evaluate an organization’s security in a controlled and professional manner.The company has not publicly confirmed the hackers’ claims or issued a statement regarding the incident.Jonathon Ellison from the National Cyber Security Centre called the hack ""deeply distressing.""","Hackers claim to have stolen the names, pictures, and addresses of approximately 8,000 children from the kido nursery chain.
