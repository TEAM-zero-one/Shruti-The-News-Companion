A sophisticated bar experience inspired by European charm

More than a bar — it’s a curated lifestyle destination





One of Edmonton’s most buzzworthy new venues is set to open its doors next week, and the anticipation is building. Lauren Kyle McDavid — the wife of NHL superstar Connor McDavid — is launching Bar Trove, an elegant new bar located in the historic Canada Permanent Building in downtown Edmonton. With an opening date set for June 6, this upscale addition to the city’s hospitality scene is already turning heads with its stylish concept and refined ambiance.Bar Trove isn’t your average night-out spot. The vision behind it draws deeply from the timeless sophistication of Parisian and London lounges. Visitors can expect an atmosphere where historical charm meets modern luxury — a rare blend in the city’s bar landscape. The design features include wood-panelled walls, plush furniture, and artfully selected fixtures, each contributing to the warm, intimate vibe of the space.This attention to detail isn’t surprising, considering Lauren Kyle McDavid is a well-known interior designer with her own firm. She has also co-founded Trove Living, a curated furniture showroom that launched alongside the bar.What sets Bar Trove apart is its fusion of design, hospitality, and social experience. It’s not just about sipping cocktails — it’s about being immersed in a thoughtfully crafted environment. Kyle McDavid explained the concept clearly in a statement shared with Dished earlier this year:“Bar Trove felt like a natural extension of Trove Living – giving people a place to gather, experience beautiful design, and enjoy incredible food and drinks in a curated setting.”The space offers a social haven for those who appreciate both aesthetics and atmosphere — something that has been missing from Edmonton’s bar scene.While the full menu remains under wraps for now, early hints suggest that Bar Trove will feature premium cocktails, a selection of fine wines and spirits, and elevated shareable dishes like oysters and caviar. The focus appears to be on quality and sophistication, promising an upscale yet approachable experience for discerning locals and visitors alike.Also Read: Patrik Laine’s fiancée Jordan Leigh throws shade at Justin Bieber as Hailey Secures billion-dollar deal without his help With its grand opening just days away, Bar Trove is poised to become one of the most sought-after destinations in Edmonton — not just for what’s in your glass, but for the design-driven atmosphere that surrounds it.",Lauren kyle mcdavid is launching bar trove in edmonton's historic canada permanent building on june 6.

Vince McMahon’s life after WWE



Also Read

Vince McMahon, the former CEO of WWE and executive chairman of TKO, is one of the celebrated figures of WWE. The former chief of the Stamford-based promotion served as a promoter, commentator, film producer, and sometimes even stepped into the ring himself.McMahon's journey with WWE began as a commentator during the 1970s. He has immensely contributed to American professional wrestling and made WWE a popular household name.Though McMahon has been one of the celebrated figures of the company, he has landed himself in many controversies, too, including Janel Grant's lawsuit, where he was accused of sexual misconduct, including a coerced sexual relationship, sex trafficking, and repeated sexual assault.Let’s take a look at his WWE journey so far, his net worth, source of income, and more.According to Forbes, Vince McMahon's net worth in 2025 is estimated at $3 billion. It is believed that the former WWE Chief has amassed such a fortune due to McMahon unloading a lot of stock in recent years. He mainly earns from his TKO Holdings and also owns his independent entertainment company, Alpha Entertainment. Courtesy to his huge wealth, Vince enjoys an equally luxurious lifestyle, with his lavish mansions and noteworthy car collections.Reports suggest that Vince McMahon has more than $670 million worth of TKO Holdings shares in 2023. It is to be noted that TKO Holdings is the new brand name for the combined WWE and Ultimate Fighting Championship. In March 2024, he again sold off a slew of TKO shares for $412 million.Not long after, in early April 2024, he sold off $311 million worth of stock, followed by the final sale later that same month through which he earned $776 million for his last remaining TKO shares, meaning McMahon is no longer officially associated with the WWE.However, some rumors suggest that Vince McMahon might be currently earning from the shares of WWE and the TKO group that he may still be holding. Vince McMahon ’s life after WWE became tumultuous. His career ended after allegations of sexual misconduct and infidelity surfaced. He reportedly used nearly $19.6 million in company funds for settlements to suppress these claims.The latest complaint has come from Janel Grant , who has filed a complaint against McMahon of 'physical and emotional abuse, sexual assault, and trafficking.Janel Grant has filed a lawsuit against WWE and John Laurinaitis. Though Laurinaitis has been removed in the new filing submitted on May 28, 2025, Vince McMahon remains a defendant. Meanwhile, his former co-defendant has agreed to provide substantial evidence to Grant’s legal team, related to the case.With this development, it will now be interesting to witness where this case takes McMahon further, after Laurinaitis provides evidence as part of the confidential settlement.","Vince mcmahon, the former ceo of wwe and executive chairman of tko, is one of the celebrated figures of wwe.

Scott Swift intervenes to protect Taylor Swift from legal fallout







In a dramatic twist to the ongoing legal battle between actors Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni Taylor Swift 's father, Scott Swift, has reportedly stepped into the spotlight with a bold move to protect his daughter. According to an explosive report by the Daily Mail, Scott approached Baldoni’s legal team voluntarily, revealing that Lively allegedly threatened to leak Taylor Swift’s private messages unless the pop star supported her publicly.The revelation comes amid a tense $400 million legal standoff in which Justin Baldoni is suing Blake Lively for defamation and extortion following her sexual harassment allegations against him. Now, Scott Swift’s involvement has added a new layer of intensity to the already volatile feud.A source told Daily Mail, “Scott Swift did not want his daughter to be dragged into this any further and he voluntarily gave up this information as part of a deal that would include [Baldoni’s team] withdrawing their subpoena for Taylor."" This alleged backdoor deal helped pull Taylor Swift out of the legal spotlight and led to Justin Baldoni dropping his subpoena.The claims surfaced in court documents filed by Baldoni’s attorney, Bryan Freedman, who alleged that Lively’s lawyer, Michael Gottlieb, had contacted Taylor’s legal team with a disturbing demand. According to the filings, Lively wanted Swift to release a statement supporting her. If she refused, private and potentially damaging text messages in Lively’s possession would be made public.It was also alleged that Lively asked Swift to delete the messages—fueling further speculation about the nature of their content.Freedman claimed that the threat was revealed during a phone call with someone “very closely linked"" to Swift, later identified by sources as Scott Swift. “The message could not have been clearer. Baldoni was not just dealing with Lively. He was also facing Lively’s ‘dragons,’ two of the most influential and wealthy celebrities in the world,” the documents stated, referring to Swift and Lively’s husband, Ryan Reynolds Though the judge ruled that Taylor's involvement was ""improper"" and ""irrelevant"" to the case, the damage may already be done. The pop icon has denied all ties to the movie It Ends With Us, stating she had no role in production or creative input.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s dad exposes Blake Lively’s alleged threat in explosive legal twist, shielding daughter from $400M scandal Meanwhile, in a subtle but telling move, Taylor Swift’s boyfriend Travis Kelce unfollowed Ryan Reynolds on Instagram—fueling speculation that personal and professional relationships are unraveling in the fallout.","Scott swift stepped in to shield taylor swift from the blake lively-justin baldoni legal drama.

Billionaire investor Mark Cuban has said that he is not impressed with the design choices of Tesla. Speaking at ""Your Mom's House"" podcast in March, he was asked ‘what's your favorite car?’. Cuban, who owns a Tesla replied with a grin “A Kia. EV6.” He further added “I like it. I'm comfortable with it.”Revealing that he hasn’t sold his Tesla ‘yet’, Mark Cuban explained: “On the Tesla you've got to find [the turn signal] and push the button… while you're driving. You can't pay attention to the road as much.”Praising Kia, he said: “It doesn't try to be too fancy. Your turn signal is like… a turn signal”.While Mark Cuban doesn’t mind driving a ‘cheaper’ Kia EV6, but his 15-year-old son isn’t impressed. When Cuban suggested handing down the car for driving practice, his son quickly shut it down, saying, “It’s not cool, Dad.” He even called it a “nerd car.” Cuban’s response? “Exactly,” he said, embracing the label.Mark Cuban is a known Elon Musk critic. Earlier this year on the ""Club Shay Shay"" podcast, Cuban admitted that he likes provoking Musk because he has ""really thin skin and it just makes it easy.""In another interview earlier this year, Cuban said “I have no problem throwing Elon under the bus, but I'll save it for when it's truly deserved.”Last year, when Musk encouraged users to share more positive content on X, Cuban wasted no time in delivering a sharp retort. “Please post a bit more positive, beautiful or informative content on this platform,” the Tesla CEO then wrote.

Meta AI shareholder meet

Meta’s artificial intelligence assistant – Meta AI now boasts one billion monthly active users across its family of apps, CEO Mark Zuckerberg . Speaking during the company’s annual shareholder meeting, Zuckerberg said “It may seem kind of funny that a billion monthly actives doesn’t seem like it’s at scale for us, but that’s where we’re at”. The milestone follows the April release of a stand-alone Meta AI app , signaling the company’s growing ambitions in the artificial intelligence space. Zuckerberg said the company plans to expand the product further before monetizing it.As Meta AI evolves, “there will be opportunities to either insert paid recommendations” or offer “a subscription service so that people can pay to use more compute,” he said.The social media giant introduced Meta AI app on April 29, giving users a direct path to its Gen AI models.During the shareholder meet, the CEO emphasized that the company’s “focus for this year is deepening the experience and making Meta AI the leading personal AI with an emphasis on personalization, voice conversations and entertainment.”According to a CNBC report, the shareholder meeting also saw votes on 14 items, including nine shareholder proposals covering issues such as child safety, greenhouse gas emissions, and a bitcoin treasury assessment.One notable proposal, submitted by JLens—an affiliate of the Anti-Defamation League—called for Meta to produce an annual report addressing hate content, including antisemitism, following recent policy changes that relaxed moderation guidelines.Preliminary results indicated that proposals not backed by Meta’s board, including one aimed at ending the dual-class share structure that gives Zuckerberg outsized voting power, were unlikely to pass. In contrast, board-supported items, such as approving board nominees and an equity incentive plan, appeared poised for approval.Meta said final voting results would be posted within four business days on its website and with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.In a related news, the company reorganised its artificial intelligence (AI) teams to expedite the development and deployment of new products and features. According to a report by Axios, Cox said in an internal memo on Tuesday (May 27) detailed the new organizational framework. As per the memo, there will be two distinct units: an AI Products team and an AGI Foundations unit. While Connor Hayes will lead the AI Products team, the AGI Foundations unit will be co-led by Ahmad Al-Dahle and Amir Frenkel.This internal restructuring, announced in a memo by chief product officer Chris Cox, aims to enhance the company's competitiveness in the evolving AI space, where it faces significant rivalry from entities like ChatGPt-maker OpenAI, Google and Microsoft.","Meta ai now boasts one billion monthly active users across its family of apps.

India’s biggest brain drain isn’t to Silicon Valley. It’s to the scroll.

Yes, I believe the next wave of global entrepreneurs will come from India

I have put my money on it

But we’re ALSO building the largest army of thumb warriors - overstimulated, under-inspired people, who're weirdly okay with it.

A billion screens.

A billion brains.

And what do most do with them?

Watch prank videos, swipe choreographed dances, and overdose on AI-generated “wisdom” like it’s roti-sabzi.

We didn’t evolve with media like the West did.

Radio → TV → Cable → Internet

We leapfrogged straight to Reels. And then fell right in

Even my 7-year-old starts with Peppa Pig and ends up in a vortex of glitchy animation and algorithmic chaos.

TikTok, Insta & YT did their job — they captured attention and monetized it.

But what did we lose in the process?

Teens that don’t talk.

Adults that don’t think - just scroll.

With AI, the stimulation will only intensify.

Opportunity?

Dystopia? Also

Feels like a ‘Black Mirror’ episode no one signed up for

This isn’t a call to delete Social apps. It’s not even a solution.

It’s a rant from a concerned father.

And maybe, a conversation about our children.

Curious to hear from other parents, professionals, educators, and entrepreneurs

What are you doing about this?

And how do we make sure the India we’re building doesn’t forget to look up?

Shark Tank India judge Anupam Mittal recently started a debate on social media addiction . In a long LinkedIn post, Mittal said that India’s biggest brain drain isn’t talent leaving for Silicon Valley, but rather millions of minds lost to mindless scrolling. Mittal also expressed his concern over the digital consumption habits of Indians. He said that while the country is moving towards producing the next wave of global entrepreneurs , it is also building an army of overstimulated and under-inspired individuals. A billion screens.

President Donald Trump seems quite not-so-happy with Apple's decision to make in India. The US President Donald Trump announced that Apple can build factories in India but will face a 25% tariff on products sold in the US if manufactured overseas. Speaking in the White House Oval Office during the signing of executive orders on nuclear energy, Trump referenced a discussion with Apple CEO Tim Cook , stating, ""I had an understanding with Tim that he wouldn’t be doing this. He said he’s going to India to build plants. I said, ‘That’s okay, but you’re not going to sell into here without tariffs.’""Trump stressed, ""We’re talking about the iPhone. If they’re going to sell it in America, I want it to be built in the United States."" Initially singling out Apple, he later broadened the tariff threat to include all smartphone manufacturers, such as Samsung and Huawei, saying, ""It would be anybody that makes that product, otherwise it wouldn’t be fair."" The tariffs are slated to take effect by the end of June 2025.Earlier in a social media post on the same day, Trump doubled down, writing, ""I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else. If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25 per cent must be paid by Apple to the US. American jobs come first!""During a recent trip to Doha, Trump had pressed Cook to focus on US manufacturing , noting India’s high tariffs make it a difficult market for US companies. He added, ""They’ve offered us a deal where they’re willing to charge us no tariff, but I told Tim, ‘I don’t want you building in India. Build here.’"" The US President highlighted that India’s tariff policies, among the highest globally, complicate market access, but he emphasised on prioritizing domestic production.Apple CEO Tim Cook, addressing tariffs during Apple’s Q2 2025 earnings call, noted that they are determined by the product’s manufacturing location. Industry experts caution that relocating iPhone production to the US would sharply increase costs due to higher labor and operational expenses. If Apple passes these costs to consumers to maintain profit margins, iPhone prices could soar to $3,000 or more, potentially impacting demand. Analysts also point out that building a US-based supply chain would require significant investment and time, given the complex global network Apple currently relies on, primarily in Asia.The policy has sparked debate, with some economists warning that tariffs could raise consumer prices and disrupt global trade, while supporters argue it could boost US manufacturing jobs. The White House has not yet clarified how the tariffs will be implemented or whether exemptions might apply for companies investing in US facilities.In a related news, Apple CEO Tim Cook reportedly declined offer to join tech exectuives and representatives at Trump's recent trip to the Middle East. The choice appeared to irritate Mr. Trump, said a New York Times report.","Us president donald trump announced that apple can build factories in india but will face a 25% tariff on products sold in the us if manufactured overseas.

YouTube CEO Neal Mohan has responded to a report claiming that Google paid him $100 million over a decade ago to prevent him from leaving the company during a 'talent war' in Silicon Valley. The topic came up during a recent episode of Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath ’s podcast, where Mohan joined as a guest.Kamath referenced a widely-circulated story from 2011, saying, “I remember reading this thing about Google offering you $100 million not to quit. Not today, but 15 years ago, which was a lot of money.”Mohan, notably, did not deny the claim but laughingly said, ""I wanna see where you're going to take this.""At the time, Mohan was playing a key role in shaping Google’s advertising strategy and product roadmap for YouTube. According to a 2011 TechCrunch report, the tech giant made the offer in the form of restricted stock units vesting over several years, in a bid to stop him from leaving for Twitter, now known as X.Twitter was reportedly eyeing Mohan for the position of Chief Product Officer, encouraged by his former boss at DoubleClick, David Rosenblatt, who had joined Twitter's board.Mohan, a Stanford-educated electrical engineer, started his career at Andersen Consulting, before moving to NetGravity. After NetGravity was acquired by DoubleClick, he rose through the ranks to become VP of Business Operations. When Google acquired DoubleClick in 2007 for $3.1 billion, Mohan joined Google and eventually became one of the most influential figures in its ad business.The 2011 retention offer seems to have paid off. Mohan continued to climb the ranks and was appointed YouTube CEO in 2023, succeeding Susan Wojcicki .Interestingly, Mohan wasn't the only executive Twitter had tried to poach. The company had also reportedly approached Sundar Pichai , then head of Chrome and Chrome OS, around the same time. Google, in response, offered Pichai a $50 million stock grant to keep him onboard. Pichai later became CEO of Google in 2015 and CEO of Alphabet in 2019.","Youtube ceo neal mohan responded to a report claiming that google paid him $100 million over a decade ago to prevent him from leaving the company.

Sanskrit for coding? DU introduces course to explore ancient language’s role in modern computing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/delhi/sanskrit-for-coding-du-introduces-course-to-explore-ancient-languages-role-in-modern-computing/articleshow/121503163.cms,"Image generated using AI: TOI/TIL Denny





NEW DELHI: Amid the debate around Sanskrit being a suitable language for coding - with some even citing Nasa's supposed use of the ancient language - Delhi University has introduced a course that brings the idea closer to the classroom.Offered by DU's Department of Sanskrit as a discipline-specific elective paper, titled ""Computer Applications for Sanskrit"", the course aims to equip students with modern computing techniques to develop tools using the Sanskrit language.Discipline-specific electives are optional courses that students can select from a range of available choices. This particular course will be accessible as an elective option to all Sanskrit students enrolled across various colleges in DU.Subhash Chandra, a faculty member at the Sanskrit department who developed the course and teaches computational linguistics, said the aim is to show students how Sanskrit can be integrated with technology.""We also have a website where we display some tools that we have developed using coding in Sanskrit. Some of these include language analysers, grammar checkers, speech tools - similar to those in Hindi that convert speech to text - and a Sanskrit research database.In this course, we will teach students coding to develop such tools,"" he said.The course syllabus will cover web-based tools development, Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) and webpage creation, alongside Unicode typing in Devanagari, OCR applications, and text digitisation and preservation. It will introduce students to interactive Sanskrit learning platforms and discuss the need for such tools in Sanskrit education. The module also includes e-learning concepts and multimedia basics.A dedicated section on Unicode will focus on typing in Devanagari script (alphabet used for Sanskrit, Hindi and other Indian languages), introducing students to relevant software and keyboard tools. Another unit is centred on the tools and techniques used for text processing and preservation of Sanskrit texts. The final unit explores Optical Character Recognition (OCR) applications for Sanskrit and other Indian languages, offering insights into the current technologies and developments in the field.While the course does not teach full-fledged programming, it introduces basic coding and digital skills to help students create interactive tools and platforms in Sanskrit - aligning, in part, with the broader narrative of giving ancient Indian languages a technological future. It is open to fourth-semester students with a working knowledge of Sanskrit and draws from tools developed by DU's Computational Linguistics Group and texts on software theory and logic.The objective of the paper, as stated in the syllabus, is to ""introduce the current researches and developments in Sanskrit computing. The primary emphasis will be on tools and techniques developed under govt and private funding and on exploring new technologies for Sanskrit"".The learning outcomes add: ""The students will get an overview of computational works undertaken in the field of Sanskrit and a clear idea about how a range of practical linguistic tasks of Sanskrit can be done by developing CL systems. And, they will also know how CL tools can facilitate the learning and teaching process in the field of Sanskrit.""On May 4, chief minister Rekha Gupta, speaking at the closing ceremony of a 10-day Sanskrit learning initiative, voiced support for the potential the language holds in the field of coding. ""Even Nasa scientists have written papers on Sanskrit and confirmed that it is a scientific language. Coding can be done in Sanskrit. It is the most computer-friendly language,"" she said.Such assertions have sparked renewed discussions on the applicability of Sanskrit in contemporary computing, with DU's course now offering a practical academic framework to explore the language's digital possibilities.The Computational Linguistics Research and Development for Sanskrit initiative at DU's Department of Sanskrit was launched in 2014 under the supervision of Chandra. The group focuses on developing e-learning tools, creating digital content for Sanskrit scientific texts, building language analysis tools, and digitising Sanskrit literature for searchable online access. The department also runs a summer school that invites students from other universities to participate in a programme termed the ""emerging intersection of Sanskrit and technology"".",Delhi university has introduced a course that brings the idea of coding in sanskrit closer to the classroom.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella addressed recent job cuts during the company’s latest Town Hall event with its employees, a report claims. At the event, he reportedly revealed that the latest round of job cuts was due to “reorganisation rather than performance,”. This clarification comes from the company weeks after it announced plans to lay off 6,000 employees, which is roughly 3% of its workforce. These terminations significantly impacted product development roles, indicating that even engineering jobs are not immune to changes in the era of artificial intelligence (AI). During a companywide town hall, Nadella also focused Microsoft's focus on accelerating the adoption of its Copilot AI assistants across customer workforces.According to a report by Bloomberg, Microsoft has also announced a new AI deal with Barclays Plc, a significant development in its effort to sell artificial intelligence tools to corporate customers.Judson Althoff , the company’s Chief Commercial Officer, informed employees that Barclays agreed to purchase 100,000 licenses for Microsoft’s Copilot AI assistants, according to people familiar with the event.Althoff also stated that numerous other customers, including Accenture Plc, Toyota Motor Corp., Volkswagen AG, and Siemens AG, already have over 100,000 Copilot users. These details were shared by individuals who requested anonymity as they discussed internal remarks, the report added.At the listed price of $30 per user per month, the deals mentioned by Althoff could be valued at tens of millions of dollars annually, though large customers often receive bulk discountsWhile the company has shared numerous anecdotes about businesses adopting Copilot, it has yet to disclose total customer figures or the financial impact of those sales.As per the report, some enterprise clients say the tools demand significant internal adjustments and employee training. As a result, many are approaching Copilot adoption cautiously, viewing it as a gradual rollout and testing phase rather than a full-scale deployment of the premium software.Microsoft is seen as a key player in AI through its partnership with OpenAI and integration of Copilot into productivity tools. The company also expects its AI offerings to generate at least $13 billion annually. However, investors remain eager for clearer proof of returns on its major AI investments.","Microsoft ceo satya nadella addressed recent job cuts during the company’s latest town hall event with its employees, a report claims.

European companies are cutting costs and scaling back investment plans in China as its economy slows and fierce competition drives down prices, according to an annual survey released Wednesday. Their challenges reflect broader ones faced by a Chinese economy hobbled by a prolonged real estate crisis that has hurt consumer spending. Beijing also faces growing pushback from Europe and the United States over surging exports.""The picture has deteriorated across many key metrics,"" the European Union Chamber of Commerce in China said in the introduction to its Business Confidence Survey 2025.The same forces that are driving up Chinese exports are depressing the business outlook in the Chinese market. Chinese companies, often enticed by government subsidies, have invested so much in targeted industries such as electric vehicles that factory capacity far outpaces demand.The overcapacity has resulted in fierce price wars that cut into profits and a parallel push by companies into overseas markets.In Europe, that has created fears that growing imports from China could undermine its own factories and the workers they employ.The EU slapped tariffs on Chinese EVs last year, saying China had unfairly subsidised electric vehicle production.""I think there's a clear perception that the benefits of the bilateral trade and investment relationship are not being distributed in an equitable manner,"" Jens Eskelund, the president of the EU Chamber in China, told reporters earlier this week.He applauded efforts by China to boost consumer spending but said the government must also take steps to ensure that supply growth doesn't outpace that in demand.The survey results show that the downward pressure on profits increased over the past year and that a fall in business confidence has yet to bottom out, Eskelund said. About 500 member companies responded to the survey between mid-January to mid-February.""It is just very difficult for everyone right now in an environment of declining margins,"" he said.","European companies are cutting costs and scaling back investment plans in china.

In a first-of-its-kind event, humanoid robots took center stage in a kickboxing match in Hangzhou, China. The competition, part of the China Media Group (CMG) World Robot Competition – Mecha Fighting Series, was held on May 25 and marked the debut of robotic fighters in a full-fledged combat sport.The robots were developed by Unitree Robotics, a Chinese tech company known for its advanced humanoid machines. Four Unitree G1 robots took part in the fight, each about 132 centimeters tall and weighing 35 kilograms, reported Asia Times.They were remotely controlled by human trainers using joysticks, and the match was broadcasted by China Central Television (CCTV).While the event sparked excitement among viewers, one social media user commented humorously, “The part that confuses me most is the referee in the ring.”Videos from the match showed the robots exchanging punches and kicks with surprising coordination. Although the strikes were more like soft pushes than real hits, the movements displayed impressive balance and speed for machines.The match was part of a larger effort to test and showcase the growing abilities of AI and robotics in dynamic settings.Earlier this year, a Unitree robot was seen in a viral video aggressively reacting to its handlers during a demo, raising safety concerns.In another case, during February’s Spring Festival Gala in Tianjin, a robot reportedly charged toward a crowd, alarming attendees.Such incidents, including a recent case at Tesla's factory in Texas where a robot allegedly injured a worker, have sparked growing concern over AI safety and the potential risks of advanced robotics. Experts have pointed to software glitches and inadequate testing as common causes, highlighting the need for strict quality control in AI development.","Humanoid robots took center stage in a kickboxing match in hangzhou, china.
