Goodbye, Frequent FASTag Recharges! NHAI Launches Annual Pass for Rs 3,000

What is KYV?

The Process

The Pain

If recurring KYCs was not enough, there’s now a KYV that you must go through if you happen to own a vehicle. Short for know your vehicle, this new process that is supposed to sanitise your FASTag is the latest compliance burden to be thrust on Indians.What was the need? Apparently, cases of misuse of FASTags — in some cases by truck drivers who were using tags meant for cars — convinced policy-makers that they needed a nationwide firewall to prevent a bunch of delinquents from misusing FASTags.It was rolled out as a mandatory process, beginning Oct 31, 2024, that requires all FASTag users to submit images of their vehicle and registration certificate to verify that the tag is linked to the correct vehicle. A National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) initiative, KYV was notified by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). To prevent fraud. And if you thought this was a one-time process, you’re wrong. The verification must be repeated every three years so that the database stays always updated. Why? The possibility of misuse, and ingenious delinquents finding more ways to bend the system.A govt official explained that instances had emerged of people keeping loose FASTags in their pockets or wallets, instead of fixing them on their vehicle windshields, “leading to misuse”.“In some cases, tags issued for cars were used on trucks to pay lower toll charges. KYV will put an end to such misuse,” said another official.A source said since the main thrust of the FASTag rollout was to increase its usage so that toll collection became digitised, there may have been some laxity on the part of banks while issuing them. A KYV, said officials, will “help sanitise the system”.“Ensuring a FASTag is assigned to and affixed on the correct category of vehicle, and that it remains active, is crucial as we prepare to roll out multi-lane free flow (MLFF) system of tolling in which vehicles will neither need to stop, nor slow down as there will be no physical barriers, said a road transport ministry official.Govt aims to bring all national highways that have four or more lanes under MLFF tolling in the next 4-5 years. Therefore, according to officials, one vehicle, one tag is so important.Asked why not detect and disable fraudulent tags or penalise those using multiple tags on the same vehicle, there were no clear answers.According to the circular issued by NPCI, all FASTags need to comply with KYV norms. The process mandates linking the FASTag to the unique Vehicle Registration Number (VRN) and chassis number. FASTag issuers, meanwhile, need to follow the one-vehicle-one tag mandate and replace all tags that are more than five years old.So, anyone with a FASTag must upload their vehicle registration certificate (RC), take a picture of their vehicle from the front and upload that along with the FASTtag and vehicle registration number, besides a side image with the tag and vehicle axles. All these, mind you, must be clearly visible.Issuers need to verify this with the VAHAN database, customer mobile number, and data entered by the point-of-sale agent. FASTags without a valid KYV will get automatically deactivated.While there is great conviction among decision-makers that KYV is the right way to go, there are unpleasant surprises galore that the process is throwing up for people, from being stopped at toll plazas and being told FASTag isn’t working because of “non-compliance with KYV”, to encountering an upload process that involves multiple rounds of clicking photos and sharing documents. Adding to frustrations is its propensity to get stuck — a backend that is simply not prepared to handle such a mammoth job — and sending harried users back to square one.“I was told by a toll gate attendant that my FASTag isn’t working because KYV hasn’t been completed. So, I stopped and had to go through the entire process of taking photos and uploading documents from the toll plaza, just so I could drive on without a penalty despite having a legal and functional FASTag. Govt talks about ease of life, ease of travel, ease of business, etc. How is this ease of anything?” a Delhi resident who recently had to do a KYV at a toll plaza in NCR asked.Having seen people struggle through this, govt officials have started telling banks they should not deactivate tags without calling up customers and informing them about the KYV norm. Sources said the issuer bank, not NPCI, is involved in backend processing of KYV documents.A senior road transport ministry official admitted the process needs to be made easier for the people. Another official said that having a similar process across bank portals and a helpline to guide people could be useful.",Kyv was notified by national payments corporation of india (npci) to prevent fraud. The verification must be repeated every three years so that the database stays always updated. Fastags without a valid kyv will get automatically deactivated.

'Some Indian companies': China OKs supply of rare earth magnets to India; what MEA said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/some-indian-companies-china-oks-supply-of-rare-earth-magnets-to-india-what-mea-said/articleshow/124974822.cms,"India’s Iran Gambit Pays Off: US Grants India Sanctions Waiver on Chabahar Port For Six More Months

Rare earth nod comes with no-export rider





NEW DELHI: Govt on Thursday announced ""some Indian companies"" have got approval from China to import rare earth magnets, to be used in automotive and electronics industries.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said licenses have been issued, which will enable access to the magnets whose procurement had been stopped after China put curbs on their sale earlier this year.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal on Thursday confirmed that some Indian companies have received licences for importing rare earth magnets from China, while responding to questions on the matter.""As far as the question of the latest talks and relaxations that have happened between the US and China (and) as to how it is going to play into our domain, I will come back to you. We have yet to look at it. I am not aware of the technicalities... But I do confirm that Indian companies have received licenses for importing rare earths from China,"" he said.Jaiswal, however, did not give details of the companies that have received permission. Industry sources said the companies include those that supply components to the automotive and electronics industries.However, the imports come with certain restrictions. These include conditions that the magnets cannot be exported to the US, and cannot be used for defence-related industries.The curbs have impacted the production of automobiles, especially electric cars and two-wheelers with companies petitioning govt to take up the matter with China.Rare earth magnets are the strongest type of permanent magnets commercially available. Their high magnetic strength and resistance to demagnetisation make them indispensable in a range of applications, especially where weight and space are constraints.According to experts, these magnets are made primarily from rare earth elements like neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium - materials that allow for powerful magnetic properties essential in miniaturised and energy-efficient devices. They are typically made from alloys that contain rare earth elements. The most commonly used rare earth magnet is the neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnet.China is estimated to account for about 70% of global rare earth metals mining and holds nearly 90% of the world's rare earth magnet's production. One of the biggest reasons that China dominates the rare earth magnet industry is its control over the entire supply chain, including mining of rare earth ores, separation and refining of rare earth elements (a complex and environmentally sensitive process), and alloy production and magnet manufacturing.Just in the Indian auto industry alone, about 870 tonnes of rare-earth magnets are required to be imported in FY 2025-26 out of the country's estimated overall requirement of 3,600 tonnes.","Mea spokesperson randhir jaiswal said licenses have been issued, which will enable access to the magnets.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says that the company’s latest round of layoffs that impacted barely 14,000 people is not because of money or AI. Instead, the real reason behind Amazon job cuts is the culture, Jassy said. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” he said as quoted by Business Insider. “It really — it's culture.”“And if you grow as fast as we did for several years, the size of businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers,” Jassy explained.“And when that happens, Sometimes, without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work,” he added. “And it can lead to slowing you down.”In a blog post dated October 28, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti announced that the e-commerce company is “making organizational changes across Amazon that will impact some of our teammates.”“While this will include reducing in some areas and hiring in others, it will mean an overall reduction in our corporate workforce of approximately 14,000 roles,” she said.Amazon’s latest job cuts is the company’s biggest layoff since 2022 when the company laid off 27,000 positions. Jassy’s remarks contradict what Amazon executive has been saying about the job cuts.In the blog post, Galetti explained “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.”Separately, Tapas Roy, vice president of device software and services sent a company-wide email this week saying the company is cutting roles within its OS & Services team and asked remaining workers to ""lean in on AI.""","Amazon ceo andy jassy says that the company’s latest round of layoffs that impacted barely 14,000 people is not because of money or ai. “the announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really ai-driven, not right now at least,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124986273,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-17580,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

YouTube TV subscribers woke up to a blackout of Disney-owned channels including ESPN, ABC, FX and National Geographic after the contract negotiations between Google and Disney failed to reach a new agreement before the deadline of October 30. The blackout of Disney channels on YouTube TV started around midnight ET on October 31, when the previous deal expired. Earlier this week, Disney also warned its subscribers about the potential disruption citing stalled negotiations over pricing. YouTube TV, which charges $82.99/month, said it was unwilling to accept Disney’s proposed rate hikes, calling them unfair to customers.The timing for the blackout of Disney channels couldn’t be worst as it affects the access to college football, NFL, NBA, and NHL games broadcast on ESPN and ABC. Viewers in Florida, for example, will miss the highly anticipated Florida–Georgia rivalry game this Saturday. Disney’s sports networks including ACC Network and SEC Network are also unavailable, leaving fans without coverage of major playoff events and seasonal matchups.The blackout impacts more than 20 channels, including:In addition to live broadcasts, recorded content from Disney networks has also been removed from YouTube TV’s cloud DVR service.Speaking about the issue, YouTube TV issued an official statement saying, “This decision directly harms our subscribers while benefiting their own live TV products, including Hulu + Live TV and Fubo”.

According to a report in Bloomberg, Apple has predicted that the company will return to growth in the world’s biggest smartphone arena as the iPhone 17 gains momentum. Apple CEO Tim Cook said at the earnings call, “It was basically supply constraints that drove the results.” Cook added, “We’re thrilled with what we’re seeing right now.”Apple CEO said that Apple’s store traffic is up significantly in China, and that the latest iPhones -- iPhone 17 series -- has been well received. Cook also said that Apple reached a new high for September-quarter revenue from services in China, while reiterating that the iPhone is doing very well.According to the report, China was a prominent topic during the earning conference, with analysts asking about the region multiple times. The threat of higher tariffs has disrupted global tech supply chain that’s already in flux because of longer-term decisions to diversify away from China.Apple’s total growth projection for the December quarter is between 10% and 12%. Cook, however, didn't specify how much China would contribute to that.Apple has seen stiffer competition from local brands in China. Reports suggest that Huawei Technologies took the top spot in June, as its campaign to reclaim a bigger share of the premium tier resonated with Chinese consumers. Xiaomi too is reported to have made a splash with its Xiaomi 17 series.IDC estimates that 58.6 million iPhones were sold worldwide in the July-September quarter, putting Apple second behind Samsung at 61.4 million of their Android-powered phones sold worldwide in the quarter.In a conference call with analysts, Tim Cook indicated his belief that the iPhone 17 lineup will continue to do well, predicting even more of the devices will be sold during the final three months of the year. “As we head into the holiday season with our most powerful lineup ever, I couldn’t be more excited for what’s to come,” Cook said. Apple expects its iPhone sales to increase at least 10% from last year's holiday season, according to projections provided by Apple's chief financial officer, Kevan Parekh. Total revenue is expected to rise at a similar rate.","Apple reported a surprise fall in sales in china.

In a major push to consolidate its presence in the Indian market, OpenAI has announced that it will offer ChatGPT Go free to all users in India starting November 4. For the uninitiated, ChatGPT Go is OpenAI's mid-tier subscription plan for its AI chatbot ChatGPT. The move targets India, which the company identifies as its second-largest and fastest-growing global market. The year-long complimentary access to ChatGPT Go comes as a direct response to similar aggressive user acquisition tactics by rivals Google and Perplexity. Both companies recently waived fees for their premium AI features to appeal to the vast Indian consumer base.OpenAI's decision follows Google's move to make its AI Pro membership, priced at Rs 19,500$, free for students for a year. Similarly, Perplexity partnered with telecom giant Airtel to offer free access to its premium plan, intensifying the battle for AI market share in the country.ChatGPT Go, which initially launched in India in August at an affordable monthly price of Rs 399, was designed as a bridge between the free tier and the more expensive ChatGPT Plus subscription. The free ChatGPT Go tier will provide Indian users with significant benefits, including: Higher message limits; Increased daily image generation and uploads; Longer memory for more personalized and context-aware responses"".Since launching ChatGPT Go in India a few months ago, the adoption and creativity we've seen from users has been inspiring,"" said Nick Turley, Vice President and Head of ChatGPT, in a statement.

What does the new e-passport rollout actually mean?

New e-passport = chip inside: The upgraded passport contains an electronic chip with digitised passport data to speed up immigration clearance and improve security. Applicants will be able to upload a digital, ICAO-compliant photo, signature and supporting documents through the new portal.

No extra biometrics or fees: The Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate in Dubai stated explicitly that biometric collection rules and passport fees remain unchanged for applicants in the UAE. If you’ve given biometrics for a recent passport, you will not be asked again just because of the e-passport introduction.

Who issues them: The Embassy and Consulate will process applications through the Passport Seva Portal (GPSP 2.0) with support from BLS International for on-the-ground services. Missions say they can handle large volumes around 1,600 passports a day across the UAE to speed renewals and new issues.

Digital chip with encrypted security data

Improved fraud protection and identity verification

Faster processing at international airports

Globally compliant with ICAO standard

Indian expats in the UAE can finally put the rumours to rest. During a press conference held on October 30, 2025 by the Embassy of India in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate General of India in Dubai, officials clarified that the rollout of India’s new chip-enabled e-passport will not involve any extra biometrics, new procedures, or fee changes for applicants in the UAE. The announcement came amid widespread speculation about additional requirements for the upgraded passport system.The e-passport looks like a regular passport but comes with a secure embedded chip containing the holder’s personal and biometric data.

Applicants will continue to use the same channels — including BLS centres, VFS services (where applicable), and the embassy or consulate counters, without the need for new appointments, extra document checks, or revised fees. The missions also urged the community to rely only on official updates from the Embassy or Consulate, reminding expats not to fall for misinformation circulating on social media.The clarification from the Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate in Dubai has offered much-needed reassurance to the UAE’s Indian community. With no added fees, no extra biometrics, and no change in the application process, the transition to e-passports is set to be smooth and stress-free for expats. As India modernises its passport system to enhance global travel security, UAE-based applicants can continue using the same familiar services without any disruption.

November 2025 fuel prices

What’s Driving the November price Buzz?

Oil prices dropped to around $65 a barrel, raising hopes for a price cut.

Then global supply tensions and sanctions sent prices jumping again up by nearly 5% in one day.

What will become cheaper if prices drop in November?

Daily Commutes Get Cheaper: If you drive to work five days a week, your monthly fuel spend could drop by AED 15–40, depending on distance and car type. It may not feel like a jackpot but over a year, that’s a few brunches saved.

School Runs for Parents: Parents doing multiple school pick-ups and drop-offs will feel this the most. With fewer refills, you save not just dirhams… but also those “Why are we stopping for petrol again?” kid complaints.

Delivery & Ride-Hailing Services: Talabat, Deliveroo, Careem, Uber, RTA taxis, chauffeur services, all rely heavily on petrol costs. If fuel drops, operating costs drop and sometimes customers enjoy lower delivery fees or promo rides.

Business Transport & Logistics: Couriers, small business vans, carpenters, maintenance and AC technicians, all feel the heat when fuel rises. Cheaper petrol can mean:

Lower service charges Fewer fuel surcharges Better deals for customers

Weekends and Road Trips Become More Tempting: Lower fuel prices = guilt-free drives to Abu Dhabi, Fujairah, Ras Al Khaimah or Hatta. A small drop in fuel cost could shave off AED 5–15 per road trip enough to justify that karak stop.

The official November petrol rates will be revealed on 31 October, and drivers are hoping this month brings a little mercy for their wallets.The fuel prices in the UAE are set through a monthly review process conducted by the UAE Fuel Price Committee.

Analysts expect a marginal reduction of a few fils per litre, which could bring Super 98 down by around 10 fils to approximately AED 2.67 per litre (about ₹61.41) and Special 95 to AED 2.56 per litre (about ₹58.88) if the trend holds.

Bangladeshi generic version slashes rare disease drug’s price by 96%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladeshi-generic-version-slashes-rare-disease-drugs-price-by-96/articleshow/124785805.cms,"Representaive image





Bangladeshi pharmaceutical company Beximco has launched a generic version of a triple combination therapy for a rare genetic disorder. US-based Vertex, which holds the patent for this therapy, charges $325,300 for a year’s treatment while the generic will slash the price by 96% to just $12,775 for adults and about $6,390 for a child per year.Patients of cystic fibrosis, a rare genetic disorder, and their families launched a community-run buyers’ club on Thursday to help patients around the world access the new generic version of the drug.Vertex’s monopoly is estimated to have generated almost $30 billion in profits over ten years just from the sale of the medicine for cystic fibrosis. A 2022 study on production costs of the medicine estimated that it could be produced for $5,700 per patient per year. Beximco is launching the generic version of the triple combination (elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor) listed as an essential medicine by the WHO . It is also launching a generic version of ivacaftor, one of the components, as the treatment consists of two tablets of the triple combination and one tablet of ivacaftor every day for adults.“This is a historic moment. We’ve watched children suffer and die while a treatment sat on the shelf, priced out of reach. Today, that changes. We’ve proven that patient power can change what billion-dollar corporations refuse to. Governments must act fast to take all the necessary steps to make this life saving drug available for every eligible patient,” said Gayle Pledger, who leads the global Right to Breathe campaign, which has been working to make this medicine accessible for cystic fibrosis patients.Cystic fibrosis disrupts mucus production in multiple organs, particularly the lungs and digestive system, leading to debilitating symptoms, such as serious chronic respiratory issues and malnutrition. Delayed diagnosis and lack of treatment contribute to an average life expectancy of less than 20 years.Tanya Takewani, mother of a child in India with cystic fibrosis, pointed out that 14 children died in 2024 waiting for treatment. “This drug has been available for more than six years. How many more children must have died in these years? There are 600 patients of cystic fibrosis identified in India. But only 50 of them get treatment under the Patient Assistance Programme. The development of a generic gives us hope,” said Takewani.Chetali Rao, a scientific researcher with Third World Network (TWN), a nonprofit that has been helping to make medicines accessible, said, “When a medicine costs more than life itself, it stops being an innovation, it becomes an exclusion. Trikafta can transform a life-threatening disease like cystic fibrosis into a manageable condition. It must be available and we were determined to find a way to make it affordable. ”This urgency drove TWN, together with patient groups Just Treatment in the UK and Right to Breathe, to approach Beximco with the proposal to develop an affordable generic alternative.","Bangladeshi pharmaceutical company beximco has launched a generic version of a triple combination therapy for a rare genetic disorder.

Guggenheim Museum in New York. (AP Photo, File)





LONDON: For sale: The world's most valuable toilet, a lavatory literally worth its weight in gold. Sotheby's announced Friday it will auction off the solid gold cistern, a sculpture by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan entitled ""America. ""The auction house calls it an ""incisive commentary on the collision of artistic production and commodity value."" It's also a fully functional toilet, identical to one that gained global fame when it was stolen in an audacious heist from England's Blenheim Palace in 2019.The starting price at the Nov 18 auction in New York will be the price of the just over 101.2kg of gold used to make it - about $10 million.David Galperin, head of contemporary art at Sotheby's in New York, said Cattelan is ""the consummate art world provocateur."" He's also one of most successful, an artist whose work ""Comedian,"" a banana duct-taped to a wall, sold at a New York auction last year for $6.2 million. ""Him"" - Cattelan's unsettling sculpture of a kneeling Adolf Hitler - sold for $17.2 million at a Christie's auction in 2016.The artist has said ""America"" satirises excessive wealth.""Whatever you eat, a $200 lunch or a $2 hot dog, the results are the same, toilet-wise,"" he once said.Two versions of ""America"" were created in 2016. The one being sold has been owned by an unnamed collector since 2017. The other version went on display in a bathroom at the Guggenheim Museum in New York in 2016. More than 100,000 visitors queued up to - to put it delicately - interact with the work.The Guggenheim offered the work to US President Donald Trump during his first term in office after he had asked to borrow a Van Gogh painting.In 2019, it went on show at Blenheim Palace, the English country manor that was the birthplace of Winston Churchill. Within days, it was stolen by burglars who broke into the building, forcibly wrenched it from the plumbing, and fled. Two men were convicted earlier this year and jailed. The toilet has never been recovered. Investigators think it was likely broken up and melted down.Galperin is unwilling to speculate on how much ""America"" could sell for. He notes that Cattelan's duct-taped banana posed questions about ""how one assigns value to something that has, in essence, no value aside from its authorship and its conceptual idea.""'America' is in many ways the complete inverse of that. It is a perfect foil in that this work has a lot of intrinsic value in a way that most artworks do not,"" he said ""The question of the proportion of value between the raw materials and the artistic idea is very on the table here.""""America"" will go on display at Sotheby's new New York headquarters, the Breuer Building, from Nov 8 until the auction. It will be in a bathroom, and visitors will be able to see it up close and personal.At Guggenheim and Blenheim Palace, the toilet was connected to the plumbing system and visitors could book a 3-minute appointment to use it. This time, visitors won't be able to use it - they can look, but they can't flush.","Sotheby's will auction off the solid gold cistern, a sculpture by italian artist maurizio cattelan entitled ""america"" it's also a fully functional toilet, identical to one that gained global fame when it was stolen in an audacious heist from england's blenheim palace in 2019.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125008566,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-65280,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

New lane rules for delivery riders in Dubai and Sharjah

What’s changing: Penalties and monitoring

What delivery riders and customer should know

For delivery riders:

From Nov 1, check which lanes you’re allowed to use — it depends on the road width. Be aware of heightened surveillance (cameras, radars) and steeper fines/permit risks. Speed-limit behaviour is under sharper scrutiny.

For delivery companies:

Make sure riders are informed and trained on new rules. Update routing so bikes avoid prohibited lanes — this may affect delivery time slightly. Monitor riders’ permit status and company liability in case of violations.

For customers and general road users:

Expect improvements in lane discipline and perhaps fewer accidents involving delivery bikes. Delivery-times might get affected in the fine-tuning period. Awareness of the rules might help smoother traffic flow.

Conclusion





Food may still come fast, but delivery riders won’t be allowed to race to get it to you anymore. In a joint announcement made in late October 2025, Dubai’s RTA and Sharjah Police unveiled tough new traffic rules for delivery riders, warning that reckless riding could now lead to Dh1,500 fines, suspended permits, and even platform bans. The message from authorities is clear: safety over speed.From November 1, 2025, the emirates of Dubai and Sharjah will see strict new regulations targeting delivery motorcycles and heavy-vehicles. In Dubai, the Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) in coordination with Dubai Police will ban delivery riders from using the fastest lanes on major roads. On roads with five or more lanes, they cannot ride in the two leftmost (fastest) lanes; on roads with three or four lanes, they cannot use the leftmost lane. This change follows a rise in road accidents involving delivery riders.In Sharjah, authorities are implementing a dedicated lane-management system: heavy-vehicles and buses must keep to the far-right lanes, while motorcycles (including delivery bikes) will be restricted to the middle or right lanes depending on road width (for example: on a four-lane road they can use the two right-most lanes; on a two-lane road only the right lane).Enforcement will rely on smart radars, high-definition cameras and 24-hour monitoring.The new rules aren’t just about new signs, they come with significant consequences. In Dubai, fines start at AED 500 for a first offence, AED 700 for the second offence, and on the third violation the delivery rider’s permit may be suspended. Violations of speed limits (exceeding 100 km/h) by delivery bikes are also targeted: the first time AED 200, rising to AED 300 and AED 400 for repeat offences. In Sharjah, heavy vehicles failing to stay in designated lanes face fines up to AED 1,500 plus 12 traffic-black-points; riders ignoring lane signs may face fines around AED 500.The motive behind the crackdown: a steep rise in accidents involving delivery riders and the growing number of delivery bikes on the road, prompted by booming e-commerce and food-delivery sectors. These measures form part of broader traffic-safety strategies focusing on enforcement, road engineering and awareness campaigns.This crackdown signals that Dubai and Sharjah are taking the surge in delivery-motorcycle traffic seriously, and moving from reactive to proactive traffic-safety governance. By restricting faster lanes and enforcing penalties, authorities hope to reduce reckless riding, collisions and fatalities. For riders it means adaptation; for everyone else it means potentially safer roads and clearer separation of different types of vehicles.If you’re involved in the delivery business (rider, fleet manager, platform) or you’re a road user in these emirates, mark the date November 1, 2025, the rules change then. Being aware today means avoiding fines tomorrow.","Uae tightens traffic rules to protect delivery riders. From november 1, 2025, the emirates of dubai and sharjah will see strict new regulations.
