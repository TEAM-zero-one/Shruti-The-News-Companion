What does Tata Motors demerger mean for investors?

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Tata Motors demerger: Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, compared to Monday's closing price of Rs 660.90. This is a notional decline in Tata Motors' share price post its demerger, according to an ET report.This adjustment occurred as the shares commenced trading ex-demerger value following the division of its commercial vehicles operations into a separate listed company. The reduction corresponds to the commercial vehicle division's removal from the parent company's valuation.October 14 is the record date for the company's division into Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV) and Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles Ltd (TMLCV). Investors holding shares through October 13 will be allocated one TMLCV share for each Tata Motors share owned.The company will adopt the name Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV), comprising passenger vehicles, electric vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) units. TMLCV shares will be transferred to demat accounts within 30-45 days, followed by independent listing on the NSE and BSE after securing regulatory clearances.The existing F&O contracts due in October, November and December were concluded on Monday, with new contracts featuring adjusted lot sizes introduced from today.Financial experts anticipate the separation to enhance value assessment and business specialisation.SBI Securities indicates that the division ""enables clearer valuation of the company's distinct businesses."" They forecast TMPV, generating 87% of revenue from JLR, to be valued between Rs 285 and Rs 384 following the split, with growth prospects tied to JLR's operational improvements.For TMLCV, SBI Securities estimates a valuation range of Rs 320-470, highlighting its forthcoming €3.8 billion purchase of Iveco Group NV's commercial vehicle division, which should triple combined turnover and strengthen presence in electric and alternative fuel technologies. ""The integration of Iveco Group NV, most likely in FY27, will expose the company to the global CV cycle,"" they note, whilst cautioning about temporary margin reduction due to Iveco's lower EBIT performance.YES Securities views the separation as a ""value unlocking opportunity,"" observing that standalone passenger and commercial vehicle operations will enable targeted investment in specific automotive sectors.Brokerages say the demerger allows for a clearer valuation of Tata Motors’ separate businesses. “Overall, we expect value creation, as the commercial vehicles (CV) business is likely to trade at around 11 times EV/EBITDA on a FY27 basis, which translates to roughly Rs 300, in line with comparable peers,” said Pankaj Pandey of ICICI Securities, as quoted by Economic Times.“For the passenger vehicles (PV) segment, we estimate a fair value in the range of Rs 450 to 500. Since this is a vertical split, one of the most anticipated demergers, we believe there should be value creation, as the PV and CV businesses are poised for distinct growth trajectories,” Pandey added.According to Bonanza Research Analyst Khushi Mistry, the division ""will lead to sharper business focus for both entities."" TMLCV debuts as India's premier commercial vehicle manufacturer, commanding 37.1% market share and achieving 12.2% EBITDA margin in Q1FY26, despite reduced revenue. TMPV anticipates 8-10% growth in H2FY26, driven by product launches, strong SUV market position, and increasing EV and CNG adoption, representing 45% of its passenger vehicle earnings.Following a September cyberattack, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), the UK subsidiary of Tata Motors, initiated phased manufacturing operations on October 8. Khushi Mistry reported that wholesale volumes decreased by 24% while retail sales fell 17% in the September quarter, resulting in estimated weekly losses of £50 million. ""Full production is expected to resume post-Christmas due to the scale of restoration needed,"" she stated.YES Securities assessed that ""2QFY26 JLR dispatches (-24% YoY and QoQ) were impacted by production losses due to the cyberattack from early Sep'25. However, the retail-level impact was much lower. We expect volumes to gradually improve in 3Q and 4Q, which should support sentiment.""The share distribution plan allocates one TMLCV share per Tata Motors share owned. Details regarding acquisition costs for both entities will be provided subsequently to facilitate portfolio and tax calculations.Share price fluctuations are anticipated during the structural transition period. Industry analysts indicate that future performance will be determined by JLR's production recovery and TMLCV's operational success following the Iveco integration.The investment community remains focused on whether the corporate separation will boost Tata Motors' share performance or if value enhancement will require a longer timeline.","Tata motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on tuesday, with shares opening at rs 399 on the bombay stock exchange. This is a notional decline in tata motors' share price post its demerger.

DRDO to tie up with Pune defence firm for production of ordinance disposal robot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/drdo-to-tie-up-with-pune-defence-firm-for-production-of-ordinance-disposal-robot/articleshow/124701000.cms,"File photo

DRDO's Combat Parachute System Successfully Tested; IAF Soldiers Perform 32,000 Ft Jump

NEW DELHI: The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) has finalised a technology transfer agreement with a Pune-based defence company for the production of the unexploded ordnance handling robot (UXOR), which is designed to neutralise ordnance weighing up to 1,000 kg.The agreement with DRDO positions Sagar Defence Engineering as one of the primary industry partners, alongside Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), for scaling up production of UXOR units, which are set to be deployed by the IAF to enhance operational safety during unexploded ordnance handling missions across sensitive zones, including forward airbases and strategic installations, a company source told TOI.Developed indigenously by DRDO over the last decade, UXOR represents a quantum leap in autonomous and semi-autonomous bomb disposal systems. Its key features include high-powered water jet cutting technology, precise disarming of explosive ordnance by cutting through bomb casings up to 25 mm thick and performing remote operation from a distance of up to 2 km — meaning operators can manage high-risk ordnance from a safe distance, thus reducing the possibility of human injuries or casualties.UXOR enables cross-terrain mobility, allowing operations on surfaces, such as airstrips, tarmacs and rugged terrains, and is capable of continuous six-hour missions, suitable for extended bomb disposal or reconnaissance operations.Sources familiar with the project said UXOR has undergone extensive trials with the IAF, including simulated bomb disposal exercises and real-world field testing at secure locations. Its performance has reportedly exceeded expectations, particularly in precision handling and operational reliability under stress conditions.Under a ToT agreement, DRDO will provide Sagar Defence, alongside BEL, with complete access to UXOR’s design documentation, manufacturing protocols, software integration, quality assurance standards and field maintenance procedures. A senior source hinted that this initiative is part of a broader DRDO strategy to increasingly involve private and public sector partners for rapid deployment of advanced defence technologies, reducing reliance on in-house production.The contract requires delivery of multiple UXOR units over the next two fiscal years, training of IAF personnel in robot operation, maintenance and emergency protocols and field deployment support during initial operational integration at selected bases.","The defence research and development organisation (drdo) has finalised a technology transfer agreement with a pune-based defence company.

Piyush Goyal Says India Aims to Remain the Fastest-Growing Large Economy for the Next 20 Years

NEW DELHI: Ahead of the upcoming annual UN climate summit (COP30) in Belém, Brazil, the Alliance of CEO Climate Leaders, representing 134 companies from 27 countries, including India, has urged world leaders to accelerate the transition to a low-carbon resilient economy.The CEO-led alliance, one of the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) flagship decarbonisation initiatives, has issued an open letter calling on govts to deepen public-private collaboration to unlock the full potential of the climate economy at a time when the transition is under threat. It underlined the current trajectories that suggest that global warming could exceed 2 degrees Celsius by mid-century, with severe consequences on economies, societies and ecosystems.The Alliance companies have a combined emissions footprint of 5.2 gigatons, accounting for 14% of global emissions — equal to the annual emissions of the US, which second after China. The group represents $4 trillion in revenues and 12 million employees in 134 companies.Tata Steel, Mahindra Group, Infosys, Hindustan Zinc, Dalmia Cement, ReNew and Wipro are among the Indian companies within the alliance, launched alongside the signing of the Paris Agreement on climate change.CEOs of big tech multi-national companies are also part of the group.The WEF noted that these companies reduced aggregate emissions by 12% while growing revenue by 20% from 2019 to 2023, proving that climate action is compatible with driving growth.Their open letter, released by the WEF this month, calls for 13 action areas to accelerate the transition and drive growth. It highlights the need for policymakers to provide more stable frameworks, shorten permitting processes, scale climate finance, support breakthrough technologies, phase out unabated fossil fuels and invest in nature and resilience.“Climate action is no longer just a moral imperative — it is a powerful driver of green growth, innovation and resilience,” said Sebastian Buckup, managing director, Centre for Nature and Climate, WEF. “We urge govts and business leaders to act decisively and accelerate proven solutions so we can unlock the full potential of the climate economy and secure a more prosperous, sustainable future for all. Our work at the forum aims to connect leaders for people, planet and sustainable progress,” the WEF quoted him as saying.The Alliance’s open letter highlights that the corporate leaders across the world have made significant investments in building low-carbon and climate resilient businesses in the recent years, proving that climate initiatives can drive long-term value for business and society.“However, this momentum now faces strong headwinds. The cost of the transition, combined with policy obstacles and uncertainties, fiscal pressures and geopolitical tensions, is slowing the transition. COP30 presents a pivotal moment for business and government to reignite progress towards a more resilient and environmentally sustainable economy,” say the CEOs in their joint open letter to govts.They suggest that the policy-makers can drive growth and create wealth by accelerating the transition by maintaining a stable and predictable policy environment; mitigating the financial risk of private investments and projects; doubling financing and incentives for breakthrough tech; transitioning away from unabated fossil fuels; removing transition obstacles such as lengthy permitting processes; and supporting investments and policies for nature.Their remaining suggestions in the list of 13 proposed actions include building climate-resilient economies and food systems; adopting science-based targets and reporting transparently on progress on emission reduction; working together across the value chain to drive low-emission end products and business models; leveraging efficiency solutions to reduce energy usage, costs and emissions; strengthen innovation and digital solutions; support creation of demand signals; and investment in climate adaptation and resilience.","Tata steel, mahindra group, infosys, hindustan zinc, dalmia cement, renew and wipro are among the indian companies within the alliance.

What’s next for her





Canadian entertainer and digital creator Lilly Singh has been officially recognised with an honorary doctorate by her alma mater, York University, a milestone that highlights her transformation from online sensation to mainstream cultural influencer. The award, bestowed during the university’s Fall Convocation on 14 October 2025, reflects Singh’s impact on pop culture, media representation, and diversity advocacy, signalling the growing significance of digital platforms in shaping global cultural narratives.Singh’s career illustrates a broader trend in global media where social media platforms have become launching pads for internationally recognised cultural figures. Beginning as a teenager posting humorous sketches on YouTube under the moniker ‘Superwoman’, she cultivated a large following through content combining comedy, personal reflection, and commentary on cultural identity. This digital prominence opened doors to mainstream television, literature, and public advocacy.Her recognition also highlights evolving metrics of influence. Universities and institutions increasingly acknowledge contributions beyond traditional academic or professional achievements, valuing social reach, advocacy, and public engagement.Singh’s honorary Doctor of Laws degree is emblematic of this shift, recognising the societal and cultural impact of digital creators in ways that transcend conventional accolades.Globally, Singh’s work resonates beyond entertainment. She has amplified conversations about gender equity, representation of minorities in media, and mental health awareness, reaching audiences across North America, Europe, and Asia. Her trajectory offers a lens into how online personalities can shape social norms and public discourse, bridging cultural gaps and challenging stereotypes.On 14 October 2025, York University conferred the honorary Doctor of Laws degree on Singh during its Fall Convocation ceremony. The award cited her “contributions to community building and accomplishments in pop culture and entertainment.” Singh, who graduated from York in 2010 with a degree in psychology, described the honour as “immense”, noting the irony of fulfilling her parents’ long-held expectations of having a ‘doctor’ in the family, albeit in an unconventional manner.Singh’s speech to the graduating class underlined her philosophy on failure and growth. She encouraged students to embrace uncertainty and to view setbacks as teaching moments, asserting that “having it all figured out is a false narrative.” Her address also highlighted her experiences as the child of Indian immigrants navigating cultural expectations while forging a career in entertainment, a journey marked by creativity, resilience, and humour.The milestone comes amid Singh’s continued presence in mainstream media. Beyond her YouTube success, she hostedin 2019, becoming the first woman of Indian descent to lead a late-night talk show on a major American network. She has also authored bestselling books blending personal anecdotes with practical advice, further consolidating her influence across multiple platforms.Singh’s recognition signals the increasing legitimacy of digital creators in shaping cultural narratives. In a media ecosystem historically dominated by traditional broadcast networks and print outlets, social media personalities now influence public opinion, social norms, and even policy discussions on inclusivity and diversity.Her work also underscores the importance of representation. By foregrounding South Asian identity, gender equity, and minority experiences, Singh provides a template for how entertainers can leverage visibility to challenge stereotypes and promote social inclusivity. This has implications not only for entertainment but for broader societal attitudes, encouraging younger audiences to pursue unconventional paths while advocating for equity.Economically, figures like Singh exemplify the monetisation potential of digital platforms. Her trajectory highlights how online content can generate significant revenue streams, sponsorships, and brand partnerships, reshaping employment and entrepreneurship in creative industries. The honorary doctorate amplifies her credibility, reinforcing the notion that influence and impact extend beyond formal qualifications.In a wider sense, platforms such as YouTube, Netflix, and other streaming networks are indirectly implicated, as Singh’s career reinforces the significance of digital-first pathways in the entertainment ecosystem. Social media companies stand to gain from the visibility and credibility conferred upon creators, while advertisers and sponsors can capitalise on the extended reach of influential figures like Singh.Singh’s trajectory is rooted in the rise of social media as a dominant form of entertainment. Launching her YouTube channel as a teenager, she capitalised on the platform’s global reach, producing content that resonated across demographics. Her channel, Superwoman, addressed universal themes of identity, family dynamics, and humour, building a subscriber base of millions within years.The transition from digital creator to mainstream television host represents a significant milestone in entertainment history, reflecting broader shifts in audience behaviour. Singh’s entry into late-night television in 2019 mirrored an era where streaming platforms and online communities began to rival traditional media in shaping celebrity culture and public discourse.Her literary contributions further illustrate this shift. By authoring bestselling books, Singh transformed personal experiences into a public narrative, extending her influence beyond screen-based content and validating digital creators as authors and thought leaders in contemporary culture.Looking ahead, Singh’s recognition is likely to encourage other digital creators to pursue multi-platform careers, blending online content, traditional media, and advocacy. Institutions may increasingly confer honours upon influencers who achieve societal impact, signalling an expanded understanding of cultural contribution.As digital influence continues to evolve, Singh’s journey exemplifies how a YouTuber can transition from niche online content to mainstream recognition, bridging cultural, generational, and geographical divides in the process.","Lilly singh has been officially recognised with an honorary doctorate by her alma mater, york university.

Scale AI shut down an entire team of contractors in its Dallas office this week, marking the latest restructuring at the startup since Mark Zuckerberg's Meta invested $14.3 billion in the company in June. The shuttered team, known internally as the NPO or New Projects Organization, had over a dozen members who focused on generalist tasks such as improving the writing ability of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots.Scale AI attributed the cuts to an industry shift toward more technical, expert-level training work, according to Business Insider. As AI chatbots improve, they increasingly require input from humans with specialised skills in fields like medicine, robotics, and finance, rather than generalist contractors.“Scale wound down a small experimental onsite program in Dallas staffed by a contract workforce,” Scale AI spokesperson Natalia Montalvo said.“This reflects an industry shift toward higher skill, expert data work. It only affects a small fraction of our overall workforce and has no impact on customer delivery,” Montalvo was quoted as saying.Scale AI offered the laid-off workers four weeks of severance pay and healthcare coverage through October, according to an email from HireArt, a staffing agency used extensively by Scale AI.The recently terminated workers were also invited to join Scale's gig-work platform, Outlier, where thousands of freelancers help train AI models.“As you navigate this transition, we want to ensure you are aware of alternative opportunities,” the email stated.Montalvo added that Scale AI continues to expand expert-level programmes and that broader groups of contractors continue to work in Dallas.The Dallas layoffs represent the latest in a series of cuts at Scale AI since the Meta investment. xAI has also made similar moves to focus on specialised AI training, recently downsizing its team of generalist AI tutors in September.",Scale ai shut down an entire team of contractors in its dallas office this week.

“And I think we’ll find plenty of things to do.”





OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has suggested that the types of jobs that are being eliminated or transformed by artificial intelligence (AI) may not be consideredin the long run. During an interview with Rowan Cheung at OpenAI ’s recent DevDay conference, Altman was asked about the possibility of AI destroying almost a billion knowledge-worker jobs before new ones are created. Altman used a thought experiment about a farmer from half a century ago to explain the situation. He said that a farmerAltman suggested that this perspective makes him feelabout the job losses. The conversation was centred on the uncertainty of what new jobs AI will create in the coming decades, similar to how a farmer in the past could not have imagined the jobs created by the internet.Sam Altman took up theanalogy when asked about the possibility of a billion jobs being destroyed before new ones are realised.Altman said, is not only that they wouldn’t believe you, howeverAltman explained that this perspective makes him feelbutHe compared the nature of work across eras, noting that a farmer performs essential labour by producing food and sustaining life, which he calledHe suggested that from a farmer’s perspective, many modern occupations might seem likerather than aLooking ahead, Altman added thatwe might feel thatAltman’s main point seems to be that jobs evolve.

MacKenzie Scott’s philanthropic ventures





Focus on diversity and equity causes









MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Amazon co-founder Jeff Bezos, has reduced her stake in the e-commerce company, cutting her holdings by nearly 42% to $12.6 billion, according to a regulatory filing with the SEC filed Tuesday and dated September 30. Many of Scott’s recent philanthropic efforts have focused on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. First reported by Bloomberg, the filing shows that Scott now holds 81.1 million Amazon shares – down 58 million from a year earlier. This reduction occurred despite Amazon shares more than doubling since Scott's 2019 divorce from Bezos.The filing, however, does not specify whether the reduction in Amazon holdings resulted from share sales, donations, or a combination of both, the report said. Under the terms of their divorce agreement, Bezos retains voting authority over Scott's holdings and is required to disclose them annually.With an estimated net worth of $32 billion, Mackenzie Scott obtained most of her wealth following her 2019 divorce from Bezos and has pledged to give away the majority of it. After ending up with approximately 4% of the e-coomerce giant, Scott has given away $19 billion in gifts to more than 2,000 nonprofits over the past five years.The median gift size of her thousands of donations since the divorce is roughly $5 million.As a part of Scott’s philanthropic efforts, one of her most recent donations includes a $42 million gift to 10,000 Degrees, a Bay Area nonprofit expanding college access for low-income and largely non-white students.According to a report by Fortune, this followed a $70 million gift to historically Black colleges and universities (HBCUs) through the nonprofit UNCF. The program, launched in 2021, aims to help HBCUs close a funding gap compared to white or elite institutions and provide long-term financial stability for minority schools.Furthermore, over the years, Scott has donated to diverse causes including an $84 million gift to Girl Scouts, $20 million to Vermont's Champlain Housing Trust, $436 million to Habitat for Humanity, and $275 million to Planned Parenthood. She previously gave UNCF $10 million in the year 2020.","Mackenzie scott, the ex-wife of amazon co-founder jeff bezos, has reduced her stake in the e-commerce company, cutting her holdings by nearly 42% to $12.6 billion.

AI's ""jagged intelligence"" problem threatens AGI timeline

Major tech players still years away from true AGI





Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis has issued a stark warning about artificial intelligence's critical flaw: inconsistency. Speaking on the "" Google for Developers"" podcast, Hassabis revealed that even the most advanced AI systems can ace elite mathematical competitions yet fail at elementary school problems—a vulnerability he says must be fixed before reaching artificial general intelligence (AGI).""It shouldn't be that easy for the average person to just find a trivial flaw in the system,"" Hassabis stated, highlighting how Google's Gemini models enhanced with DeepThink can win gold medals at the International Mathematical Olympiad but ""still make simple mistakes in high school maths.""Hassabis described current AI as having ""uneven intelligences"" or ""jagged intelligences""—excelling brilliantly in some dimensions while being easily exposed in others. This characterization echoes Google CEO Sundar Pichai's term ""AJI"" (artificial jagged intelligence) coined earlier this year to describe systems with uneven capabilities.The DeepMind chief emphasized that solving this inconsistency requires more than just scaling up data and computing power. ""Some missing capabilities in reasoning and planning in memory"" still need to be cracked, he explained, calling for better testing methodologies and ""new, harder benchmarks"" to precisely map AI strengths and weaknesses.Despite predicting AGI's arrival ""in the next five to 10 years"" in April, Hassabis acknowledges significant hurdles remain. His concerns align with OpenAI CEO Sam Altman 's recent assessment following GPT-5's launch, where Altman admitted the model lacks continuous learning capabilities—something he considers essential for true AGI.The warnings underscore a growing recognition among AI leaders that current systems' propensity for hallucinations, misinformation, and basic errors must be addressed before achieving human-level reasoning—a cautionary tale reminiscent of social media platforms' early failures to anticipate consequences at scale.",Google deepmind ceo demis hassabis has issued a stark warning about artificial intelligence's critical flaw: inconsistency.

Rise of Chinese AI chip companies

China to tech companies: You cannot buy AI chips from Nvidia





Nvidia, the American semiconductor giant, has seen its dominance in China’s advanced chip market vanish, with its market share dropping from 95% to Zero due to stringent US export controls, according to CEO Jensen Huang. Speaking at a Citadel Securities event in New York earlier this month, Huang revealed that Nvidia is completely barred from selling its high-performance AI chips, including the A100, H100, and H200 models, to Chinese companies since restrictions began in 2022.A video of the interview was released recently. Huang expressed hope for a policy shift, stating, “We will continue to explain and inform and hold on to hope for a change in policy.” He emphasized that Nvidia’s exclusion from China not only harms the company but also has broader implications for both China and the U.S. “What harms China could oftentimes also harm America, and even worse,” Huang said. He further highlighted China’s significant role in global AI development, with roughly 50% of the world’s AI researchers.Nvidia CEO's remarks come as China carries on with a nationwide push for semiconductor self-sufficiency.Chinese AI and semiconductor contenders have rushed to launch domestic alternatives, eroding Nvidia’s once-dominant market share. Huawei’s advancements, including clustering methods to bypass Nvidia’s technology and cutting-edge manufacturing techniques, signal China’s aggressive push for semiconductor self-sufficiency.Despite receiving US approval to sell a less powerful H20 chip tailored for the Chinese market, Nvidia faces further challenges. Chinese authorities launched a security investigation into the H20, and local clients were advised to avoid the product, further limiting Nvidia’s foothold. Huang warned that excluding Nvidia from China risks ceding the market to domestic competitors like Huawei Technologies, which recently unveiled an ambitious AI chip roadmap.“It’s a mistake not to have those researchers build AI on American technology,” Huang said, raising concerns about balancing U.S. technological leadership with global collaboration. As China accelerates its domestic chip development, Nvidia’s absence from the market could reshape the global AI and semiconductor landscape.Nvidia recently got shut out of the Chinese market after China’s internet regulator, the Cyberspace Administration of China, reportedly banned domestic tech companies from buying Nvidia AI chips. According to a report by Financial Times, the Chinese agency also told tech companies, including TikTok-parent ByteDance and Alibaba, to stop testing and ordering Nvidia’s RTX Pro 6000D server, a device designed specifically for the market in China.","N nvidia ceo jensen huang revealed that the company is barred from selling its high-performance ai chips to chinese companies.

Sales roles protected while support jobs disappear









Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff is delivering contradictory messages about AI's role in the workplace. While his company recently eliminated 4,000 customer support positions in favor of AI agents, he told TBPN, a live daily YouTube show, this week that AI lacks something essential for sales roles—insisting artificial intelligence cannot replace human salespeople because it lacks the irreplaceable value of face-to-face communication.""AI doesn't have a soul. It's not that human connectivity,"" Benioff said, emphasising that face-to-face communication remains essential. Despite his company's aggressive AI deployment, he's now hiring between 3,000 and 5,000 new salespeople, aiming to reach 20,000 account executives this year.The hiring announcement comes months after Benioff revealed on The Logan Bartlett Show podcast in September that Salesforce had slashed its customer support workforce from 9,000 to approximately 5,000 employees. ""I need less heads,"" he stated bluntly, explaining that AI agents now handle 50% of customer interactions that humans once managed.The cuts have proven financially beneficial for Salesforce, reducing support costs by 17% since early 2025. The company's AI agents have completed over a million customer conversations, demonstrating the technology's capability to replace human workers in certain functions.Benioff's distinction between roles reveals a strategic vision: AI can handle routine support tasks, but complex sales relationships still require human touch.He pointed to networking at Salesforce's Dreamforce conference as proof, noting the St. Regis Hotel bar was ""filled"" with customers ""talking to each other and connecting, going more deeply, having that human touch.""The CEO's stance contrasts sharply with broader industry trends, where over 64,000 tech workers have been laid off this year. Companies including Microsoft, Meta, and Google have all reduced headcount while investing heavily in AI, with customer service and sales roles ranking among the most vulnerable positions to automation.Benioff maintains this isn't dystopian but ""reality,"" even as his company exemplifies the dual nature of AI's workplace impact: eliminating some jobs while supposedly protecting others based on perceived irreplaceability of human connection.","Salesforce ceo marc benioff is delivering contradictory messages about ai's role in the workplace.

MUMBAI: Bombay HC has granted temporary injunction against an unknown hacker who has threatened to leak confidential data of a private insurance company, reports Rosy Sequeira.Generali Central Life Insurance Company Ltd sought relief and showed a screenshot of the hacker's threat to pay him $500,000 or he would sell the information. No details of the hacker who identifies itself as 'Medusa' was available, and so he was impleaded as a John Doe (unknown entity) defendant.Representing Generali Central Life Insurance Company Ltd, a joint venture between Generali Group and Central Bank of India, senior advocate Venkatesh said the nature of the confidential data compromised includes the company’s information, its business and customer details. Dhond said given past instances of such ransomware attacks, it is very likely the hacker may disseminate the Generali Central’s data which will cause grave and irreparable loss, harm andinjury to it and its customers. He urged similar relief as was granted earlier to HDFC Life Insurance Company Ltd.“I am of the view that a strong prima facie case has been made out for the grant of ad interim relief. The gravity of the consequences that may follow if the applicant’s confidential data is made public or traded is overwhelming,” said Justice Arif Doctor on Thursday.He restrained the hacker and its directors, proprietors, partners and persons claiming through them from using, copying, distributing,transmitting and disclosing the information of the confidential stolen data from Generali Central or any other information relating to it not available in the public domain.Justice Doctor also directed the Central Department of Telecommunication (DOT) and Ministry of Electronic and Information Technology (MEITY) to “forthwith” delete, block and disable accounts, content, domain names, phone numbers and email addresses in relation to the stolen data with 24 hours of intimation by Generali Central.","Bombay hc has granted temporary injunction against an unknown hacker who has threatened to leak confidential data of a private insurance company.

Why UK government launched this plan



What is the use of ID?



How Veteran can use access digital IDs?



Is it similar to India?







The UK government launched the digital version of its ID scheme on Friday, intended for former members of the armed services.This ID will mean passports, driving licenses, national insurance cards, and many more being virtual, instead of—or as well as—being stored in a shoebox or under socks in a drawer, Sky News reported.The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.The govt claims the initiative is designed to reduce illegal immigration by making it more difficult for those without status to secure employment.Ministers contend that the ability to obtain jobs is a primary attraction for migrants entering the UK unlawfully. Under the new system, employers will no longer be able to depend on National Insurance numbers—which currently serve as part of proof of the right to work—or on paper-based verification methods, BBC reported.""At the moment, it is quite easy to borrow, steal or use someone else's National Insurance number and that is part of the problem in the shadow economy—people sharing National Insurance numbers for example. The idea is that having a picture attached would make it—in theory—harder to abuse that system,"" a government spokesperson explained.The digital IDs, which will be app-based and stored on smartphones akin to the NHS App or digital bank cards, will contain information such as the holder's residency status, name, date of birth, nationality, and a photograph.Sir Keir, when announcing the scheme, stated: ""You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID. It's as simple as that.""From today, Friday 17 October, it will give ex-soldiers a seamless way to confirm their status in person and will include information already featured on their physical card with the security features that protect their personal information.Ministers hope the digital veteran card will show how the technology works and quash public concerns about privacy and security.Veterans will now be able to hold their credentials in a smartphone app called Gov.uk One Login. The govt had previously announced that digital credentials, including the veteran card, would be stored in an app named Gov.uk Wallet. It now states it will “transition to talking about [One Login] as the Gov.uk Wallet” as more govt-issued credentials become available digitally. The credential will be stored under encryption in the app, similar to how a train or concert ticket is held in an Apple or Google wallet, The Guardian reported.Verification using face ID or a fingerprint will be required to access it, and the govt claims it is safer than physical IDs. Another version of the credential will be held by the Ministry of Defence, and as more IDs are added, the information will remain with each issuer and in the citizens’ app, ensuring there is no central database of all ID data, thereby avoiding what some have feared could be a “honeypot for hackers”.India has well established digital ID system. India’s digital ID system, Aadhaar, is significantly larger and more detailed than the UK’s planned system.New Delhi stores citizens’ fingerprints, eye scans, photos, home addresses and phone numbers, with the system processing approximately 80 million authentications daily.Under Aadhaar, every Indian citizen receives a 12-digit number intended to replace numerous paper documents. All adults and children over the age of five must provide biometric information. The system verifies identities for activities such as opening bank accounts or applying for new SIM cards. It also aimed to streamline the disbursement of govt benefits, providing holders with instant proof of identity and access to basic services.Aadhaar and UK's digital ID seems to be same.India also have other apps like DigiLocker, where you can store all the important documents like Aadhar Card, Pan card, driving license digitally at one place, Digi Yatra and many more.The UK's digital ID seems to be following the similar model of India. Like DigiLocker, UK is introducing Gov.UK Wallet. Few days ago, UK PM Keir Starmer made his first trip to India and hailed India’s ID system as a “massive success”.During his trade-centric visit to Mumbai, Starmer also met with Nandan Nilekani, co-founder and chair of Indian tech services group Infosys, who led the govt body responsible for delivering the ID database more than a decade ago.",The uk government has announced the introduction of digital ids aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.

Lithium-ion battery and power bank fire incidents trigger stricter airline regulations

List of items banned/prohibited by UAE carriers

Item / Category Cabin (Carry‑On) Checked Baggage Key Restrictions / Notes PEDs with built‑in lithium batteries (phones, laptops, tablets, cameras) Yes Yes (in many cases) Battery must be ≤ 100 Wh; max 15 devices per passenger (Etihad); must be fully switched off in checked baggage. Spare / loose lithium batteries Yes (cabin only) Not allowed Must be ≤ 100 Wh (or ≤ 160 Wh with airline approval); terminals must be protected. Power banks Yes (under 100 Wh only) Not allowed Only 1 per passenger (some airlines); must be labelled; usage banned onboard on some airlines (e.g., Emirates from Oct 1, 2025); must not be stored in overhead bins. Smart bags / motorised rideables (hoverboards, mini‑Segways, etc.) Often banned Not allowed Battery must be removable; if not, item is fully prohibited. Mobility aids with lithium batteries (wheelchairs, etc.) Allowed (with approval) Allowed (with approval) Battery ≤ 300 Wh (or 2 x 160 Wh); must be removable and protected. Airline approval required. Devices with integrated lithium batteries (in checked baggage) Sometimes allowed Yes (with conditions) Device must be off; lithium content restrictions apply (metal > 0.3 g or ion > 2.7 Wh may be restricted). Liquids, aerosols, flammable items Varies Varies Alcohol above 70% banned; compressed gases, flammables restricted; check airport/airline rules.

Key highlights and practical tips

The 100 Wh capacity threshold is a recurring standard for lithium‑ion batteries across these UAE airline/airport policies (carry‑on only for many battery types).



The rule that power banks may not be used onboard flights (on certain airlines) is relatively new (e.g., Emirates from 1 October 2025) and reflects a tighter safety stance.



Many items that use lithium batteries (spare batteries, power banks, rideables) are considered high fire risk — thus limitations apply for carry‑on vs checked.



Even if an item is technically allowed, poorly‑packaged or non‑compliant items may be confiscated at security/boarding. Emirates explicitly warns of this.



Always check both your airline’s policy and the airport/departure country’s regulated lists (e.g., Dubai Airports “Departures Prohibited Items”).



For flights to/from the U.S., additional rules apply (e.g., electronic devices must be charged and operated when requested).





The recent lithium battery fire aboard an Air China flight on October 18 has once again spotlighted the growing aviation safety concerns related to power banks and lithium-ion batteries. Flight CA139, traveling from Hangzhou to Incheon, South Korea, was forced to divert to Shanghai after a lithium battery either from a power bank or a device ignited in an overhead bin. Fortunately, no injuries were reported and the plane landed safely. This incident renews global concern about the risks posed by lithium batteries onboard aircraft, particularly when stored in overhead compartments where smoke detection can be delayed.Barely a day later, on October 19, an IndiGo flight in Delhi faced a similar scare when a passenger's power bank caught fire during taxiing. The crew contained the blaze swiftly with no injuries, underscoring the persistent risks of these devices in aviation. Airlines stressed the importance of strict guidelines for battery-operated devices following these events.The International Air Transport Association (IATA) reports lithium battery fires occur about once every 10 days globally, often involving power banks or spare batteries in overhead bins.Aviation experts caution that while a full global ban on power banks is not immediate, tightening watt-hour limits and usage rules is underway. If incidents persist, wide prohibitions could follow, but banning all lithium battery devices is impractical given their ubiquitous use in laptops, medical devices, and cameras.Following the incident, China has banned uncertified or recalled power banks on domestic flights from June 2025 onward, allowing only ""3C"" certified units. Several airlines, including Korean Air, Air China, and Qantas, have also issued advisories restricting power bank use onboard. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has called for improved crew training on lithium battery fires and better passenger communication about safe storage.Ahead of these incidents, UAE carriers like Emirates and flydubai had already introduced stringent controls effective October 1, 2025. Still, passenger confusion remains high; many incorrectly believe power banks can be checked in, despite global rules requiring them in cabin baggage with terminal protection. Travellers are urged to carry only certified power banks under 100 Wh in hand luggage, avoid using or charging them during flights, store them within easy reach (not in overhead bins), and report immediately if devices overheat, smoke, or spark.While the Air China fire could accelerate regulatory restrictions, the aviation industry balances safety with practicality, given passengers' dependence on battery-powered devices. Experts emphasize the shift from convenience towards caution will continue, with potential for stricter bans if major fire incidents reoccur. Until then, strict adherence to existing guidelines remains key to safe travel.","Aviation experts suggest recent flight fires could impact uae carriers to restrict power banks, devices with lithium-ion batteries on board.
