IAF Workhorse MiG-21 Makes Last Sorties At Nal Ahead Of Sept 26 Chandigarh Farewell

NEW DELHI: Air Chief Marshal A P Singh on Tuesday cautioned against rushing the rollout of theatre commands, stressing that India must adopt its own model instead of copying others. He suggested setting up a joint planning and coordination centre in Delhi, under the Chiefs of Staff Committee, to prepare for ""future wars.""Speaking at the Army War College, the Chief of Air Staff, cautioned against rushing into the creation of new theatre commands, warning that creating a new structure while disrupting everything is not a very good idea at this point of time.Instead, he proposed setting up a joint planning and coordination centre in Delhi, placed under the Chiefs of Staff Committee, to issue directions jointly saying, ""I personally feel that having a joint planning and coordination centre in Delhi is what is required.""Responding to questions on the proposed theatre commands, Singh said, ""yes, we can start with this first, implement it and see how it pans out. If we need any more structure, we can think about it. But disrupting everything and making one structure now at this time, I do not think it is a very good idea.""The Air Chief Marshal's remarks came three-and-a-half months after Operation Sindoor, which showcased strong coordination among the Army, Navy and Air Force.Citing the recent Operation Sindoor, a tri-service simulation held from May 7 to 10 against Pakistan, Singh underlined how the three service chiefs worked closely in planning and execution.The exercise, he said, reinforced both the primacy of air power and the value of coordination. He further noted that ""centrally planned"" decisions could still be executed in a decentralised framework, which in his view ""will work out the best.""He also cautioned against blindly following international models saying India should not be inspired by any other country, like the US, in rolling out theatre commands, stressing that the nation must design a framework suited to its own requirements.""Everybody has their own requirements. We need to think about what we need there, and then only we should go about it. Otherwise, we will go wrong,"" he said.""We should not just come under any pressure and say we have to implement it now. Somehow, we have to do it. It should not be done this way. I think we can stand our ground and discuss things,"" he added.The Air Force chief also underlined the need to focus on preparing for tomorrow's wars, where clarity in the chain of command will be critical.""You cannot have a theatre commander sitting somewhere... now whom they talk to, where do they get directions from. Phones are available but generally that does not work like that,"" he said.""I feel having joint planning and coordination at the apex level is what is required. If directions go from it, things will work out. We don't actually need another structure at the lower level,"" Singh added.The government’s proposed theaterisation model aims to bring the three services under unified commands to better integrate capabilities and use resources more effectively.Under the plan, each theatre command would combine units of the Army, Navy and Air Force to handle security challenges in a specific region. Currently, the three services operate under separate commands.","Air chief marshal a p singh on tuesday cautioned against rushing the rollout of theatre commands.

In May, those same G1 robots had competed in the “Mecha Fighting Series” at the World Robot Competition in Hangzhou.The robots rise to about four feet tall, weigh around 35 kg (about 77 lb), and can move fast with good balance. People were curious to see them strike and move like humans.During the demo, one of the robots did not follow the planned moves. It moved toward Dana White instead of stepping back.

Taylor Swift announces 12th album in debut podcast appearance



Taylor Swift’s engagement with Travis Kelce makes August unforgettable





For Swifties, August has never been just another page on the calendar. It’s a month that carries the emotional weight of her song “august” from Folklore, and over the years, Taylor Swift has turned it into a symbolic time of reflection and renewal. In 2025, she did more than honor that tradition—she elevated it. With the announcement of her 12th studio album and her engagement to Travis Kelce , August officially became a month stamped by both her artistry and her love story.When Taylor Swift revealed The Life of a Showgirl on the New Heights podcast, she not only surprised fans but also shifted how major artists approach album announcements. It wasn’t a glossy press conference or a heavily produced Instagram live—it was her podcast debut, a relaxed setting where the conversation flowed naturally with Travis Kelce by her side.The title itself hints at a project brimming with theatricality, resilience, and personal storytelling—themes that Swift has always intertwined seamlessly with her music. he choice of New Heights wasn’t accidental either. It tied together two of the most powerful narratives of her current journey: her flourishing music career and her relationship with Travis Kelce.Cultural critics were quick to point out that by choosing New Heights, Swift subtly merged her music world with the sports arena, further solidifying the “power couple” narrative she and Kelce embody. It was less about surprise and more about synergy—an announcement that resonated not just with Swifties but also with NFL fans who have watched her romance with Kelce unfold.If the album reveal was a gift for her fans, the engagement was a moment that transcended pop culture. “Taylor and Travis are officially engaged” became more than a headline—it became a unifying conversation, drawing in people from music circles, football communities, and beyond.What makes their relationship stand out is its grounding in normalcy, despite the fame surrounding them. Their willingness to share milestones publicly, like the podcast debut and now the engagement, shows a couple comfortable with balancing personal joy with public curiosity. For Swift, who has navigated highly scrutinized relationships before, this engagement marks not only a romantic milestone but also a narrative shift—from guarded heartbreak anthems to openly celebrated love.Fans across social media quickly dubbed August “Swifties’ New Year,” a month that seems to reset the cycle of anticipation and excitement around her life and career. Between the promise of The Life of a Showgirl and the fairytale progression of her romance, Swift managed to turn August into more than a season of nostalgia—it became a season of new beginnings.And in true Swift fashion, she didn’t just own the moment; she owned the month.Also Read: Selena Gomez reacts with sweetest message to best friend Taylor Swift’s engagement with Travis Kelce",Taylor swift announced the life of a showgirl on the new heights podcast.

A call for 90-hour workweeks



The 30-year old tech billionaire and co-founder of ScaleAI , Lucy Guo is making headlines for her intense work ethic and her advice to other startup founders . At the age of 30, Guo has become the youngest self-made female billionaires after Meta made a major investment in her company. After the investment, Guo’s net worth increase to $1.3 billion surpassing popular pop icon Taylor Swift.Apart from this, Guo is also known for her strict daily routine. She starts her day at 5.30 am with back-to-back workouts at Barry’s Bootcamp. She also skips her lunch in order to main her momentum during working hours. In an interview with CNBC, Guo said, “Most people could have work-life balance if they cut out what they waste time on after work—like doom scrolling or watching TV.”Her daily routine also includes working till midnight and socialising till 2 a.m, but she still wakes up early for her workout routine. She claims that her ability to function with minimal sleep gives her more hours in the day as compared to others.Guo also shared an advice for startup founders. She urged the founders to embrace a 90-hour workweek at least in the initial period of building the company. Her stance echoes the controversial “996” culture—working 9 a.m. to 9 p.m., six days a week—prevalent in parts of China’s tech industry.“When you’re first starting your company, it’s near impossible to do it without doing that,” she said, emphasizing that extreme effort is essential to get things off the ground.While Guo’s discipline has earned admiration, her work philosophy has drawn criticism from mental health advocates and startup veterans.","Lucy guo has become the youngest self-made female billionaires after meta made a major investment in her company.

Nvidia’s rise: A talent gap in semiconductors



The bubble warning: “Uncomfortably close to 1999”



Nvidia recently reported its second-quarter revenue. The company reported revenue of $46.74 billion, a 56% year-over-year jump, beating Wall Street’s forecast of $46.02 billion. Despite the strong numbers, shares fell 3.14% post-earnings, reflecting investor caution. Billionaire investor and PayPal co-founder Peter Theil praises Nvidia’s chip monopoly but cautions against chasing the hype. Theil acknowledged Nvidia’s dominant position in the hardware layer of AI , but suggests that the stock of the world’s most valuable company may no longer be a good investment. Speaking at the All-in Summit in September 2024, Theil talked about his perception on the ongoing AI race .As reported by Bezinga, speaking at the All-In Summit in September 2024, PayPal co-founder and venture capitalist Pete Theil refused to crown a winner the in AI arm race between Sam Atlman, Mark Zuckerberg and Elon Musk. Instead of this, Theil turned the spotlight on Nvidia and praised the company for its grip on the hardware layer of AI. He said, ""It's Nvidia, it's the hardware, the chips layer,"" adding that they are ""making all the money while everybody else is collectively losing money.""“Whoever I talk to last … I find very convincing in the moment,” Thiel joked, reflecting on his shifting views after conversations with Musk and others. He criticized OpenAI’s former nonprofit structure as “preposterous,” suggesting its chaotic governance may have justified its pivot to a for-profit model.Thiel attributed Nvidia's current monopoly to a generational shift in talent, noting that after 1993, talented people gravitated toward software rather than semiconductors, leaving the field open for companies like Nvidia to dominate.He emphasised that most of the founders flocked to software, Nvidia quietly focused on building monopoly in GPUs which is now the backbone of AI infrastructure. “They’re making all the money while everybody else is collectively losing money,” Thiel noted.Despite the promising growth showed by Nvidia, Theil voiced his concern about the AI investment frenzy. Comparing it to the dot-com bubble, he said the current climate feels “uncomfortably close to 1999.”He acknowledged Nvidia’s blockbuster performance but warned that its stock may no longer be a bargain. “Maybe a year ago or two years ago, Nvidia would have been a good buy,” Thiel said. “Now everyone knows they’re making too much money and everyone’s trying to copy them.”","Peter thiel: ai race is no longer about elon musk, sam altman, or mark zuckerberg.

What are protesters demands

Two Microsoft employees were terminated on Wednesday, August 27, after their participation in a sit-in at the company president's office, a protest against the tech giant's business ties to Israel. The employees, Anna Hattle and Riki Fameli, were reportedly among seven protesters who occupied the office of Microsoft President Brad Smith on Tuesday. According to the activist group No Azure for Apartheid , Hattle and Fameli received voicemails informing them of their termination. A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed the dismissals, citing ""serious breaches of company policies and our code of conduct"" related to ""the break-in at the executive offices.""The other five protesters arrested during the sit-in were identified as former Microsoft workers or individuals unaffiliated with the company.“Two employees were terminated today following serious breaches of company policies and our code of conduct. The first violated the Business Conduct Policy, participated in the unlawful break-in at the executive offices, and other demonstrations on campus, and was arrested by authorities on our premises on two occasions. The second was involved in the break-in at the executive offices and was subsequently arrested. These incidents are inconsistent with the expectations we maintain for our employees. The company is continuing to investigate and is cooperating fully with law enforcement regarding these matters.”The protest group No Azure for Apartheid has demanded that Microsoft sever its ties with Israel and provide reparations to Palestinians. The group's name references Microsoft's Azure cloud software, which a joint media investigation by The Guardian, +972 Magazine, and Local Call reported is used by an Israeli military surveillance agency. The investigation claimed the agency utilized Azure to store recordings of phone calls made by Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza and for the broader surveillance of Palestinians.""We are here because Microsoft continues to provide Israel with the tools it needs to commit genocide while gaslighting and misdirecting its own workers about this reality,"" Hattle said in a statement.In response to the media investigation, Microsoft announced this month that it had hired the law firm Covington & Burling LLP to conduct a review.Two employees terminated in April due to similar protestsThe firings of Hattle and Fameli follow a similar incident in April when two other Microsoft employees were also terminated after a pro-Palestinian protest interrupted a company event.

Anupam Mittal: AI can’t fake courage

Here’s the LinkedIn post shared by Anupam Mittal

A founder recently bragged -

‘I get all my ideas from ChatGPT’

He thought it was a flex. I saw a red flag 🚩

Because Gen AI mostly averages existing knowledge. It sounds brilliant > smooth, confident, articulate but too often it’s just platitudes and polite sycophancy.

I’ve seen AI-written mails from senior leaders that read like genius… and meant nothing. In fact, its pretty obvious its a senseless Ctrl C Ctrl V ❌

Same with decks, pitches, even ‘strategy notes’ churned out start-to-finish by a model.

Outsourcing judgement isn't leadership 🤷

The best managers and founders I know use AI for speed and structure but the instinct, the angles, the contrarian call, the uncomfortable decision? That’s all on them.

My take - AI can fake intelligence. It can’t fake courage or an original point of view.

1. Predict key discussion points for meetings



2. Draft comprehensive project updates



3. Assess product launch readiness



4. Categorize time and focus areas



5. Prepare for specific meetings

AI-driven productivity at work emphasised by Satya Nadella



Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has highlighted how GPT-5, integrated into Microsoft 365 Copilot , has become an essential part of his daily workflow. Launched on August 7, 2025, GPT-5 brings advanced AI capabilities across apps like Outlook, Teams, Word, and Excel, analyzing data from emails, meetings, and chats to provide actionable insights. Nadella shared five specific prompts that he uses to streamline work, save time, and improve decision-making. These examples showcase how AI can anticipate meeting priorities, prepare project updates, track progress, and optimize scheduling, reflecting a shift toward AI-driven productivity at the executive level.“Based on my prior interactions with [/person], give me 5 things likely top of mind for our next meeting.”Nadella uses GPT-5 to analyze past interactions with colleagues and generate a list of five topics likely to be on their minds in upcoming meetings. By scanning emails, chat histories, and previous meetings, the AI anticipates priorities, unresolved issues, and recurring themes, helping executives prepare efficiently and align discussions with strategic goals.“Draft a project update based on emails, chats, and all meetings in [/series]: KPIs vs. targets, wins/losses, risks, competitive moves, plus likely tough questions and answers.”Another prompt allows GPT-5 to compile project updates by aggregating data from emails, chats, and meetings. The AI highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) versus targets, successes and setbacks, potential risks, and competitive actions. It even predicts likely questions from stakeholders and suggests thoughtful responses, ensuring concise, data-driven communication for briefings and reports.“Are we on track for the [Product] launch in November? Check engineering progress, pilot program results, risks. Give me a probability.”Nadella asks GPT-5 to evaluate whether projects, like an upcoming product launch, are on track. The AI reviews engineering progress, pilot program results, and potential risks, then calculates a probability of success. This probabilistic insight supports informed decision-making and helps executives identify areas needing attention before critical deadlines.“Review my calendar and email from the last month and create 5 to 7 buckets for projects I spend most time on, with % of time spent and short descriptions.”GPT-5 can analyze Nadella’s calendar and email activity over the past month to categorize his time into 5–7 project “buckets.” It estimates the percentage of time spent on each and provides short descriptions, offering a clear overview of focus areas. This allows leaders to optimize schedules, reallocate efforts, and ensure alignment with strategic priorities.“Review [/select email] + prep me for the next meeting in [/series], based on past manager and team discussions.”The final prompt reviews a selected email and prepares Nadella for an upcoming meeting by summarizing relevant past discussions with managers and team members. The AI suggests talking points, action items, and context-aware insights, helping executives enter meetings fully informed and ready to address key decisions efficiently.Nadella’s use of GPT-5 in Microsoft 365 Copilot reflects a broader trend toward AI-powered workflows. By automating routine tasks, analyzing complex data, and generating actionable insights, AI can save time, improve strategic decision-making, and enhance overall productivity. As organizations continue to integrate tools like GPT-5, executives and teams alike can leverage AI to focus on higher-value work while staying informed, organized, and proactive.","Microsoft ceo satya nadella has highlighted how gpt-5, integrated into microsoft 365 copilot, has become an essential part of his daily workflow.

The move marks a significant career pivot for the engineering wunderkind who became the youngest SpaceX employee in company history.""After two years at SpaceX, I felt ready to take on new challenges and expand my skill set into a different high-performance environment,"" Kairan Quazi told Business Insider. ""Citadel Securities offered a similarly ambitious culture, but also a completely new domain, which is very exciting for me.""Kairan Quazi starts this week at the systematic trading giant's New York City office, where he'll work on global trading infrastructure at the intersection of engineering and quantitative problem-solving, according to Business Insider.Despite receiving offers from leading AI laboratories and major tech companies, Kairan Quazi chose quantitative finance for its unique combination of intellectual challenge and immediate feedback. ""Quant finance offers a pretty rare combination: the complexity and intellectual challenge that AI research also provides, but with a much faster pace,"" he explained to Business Insider.At Citadel Securities, Kairan Quazi expects to see measurable impact in days rather than the months or years typical in research environments. The decision represents a notable recruiting win for the trading firm, which competes intensely with AI companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI for top talent.Kairan Quazi's journey began when he skipped from third grade directly to college at age 9. By 10, he was interning at Intel Labs , and at 11, he transferred to Santa Clara University, eventually becoming their youngest graduate in 172 years.SpaceX hired Kairan Quazi at 14 to work on production-critical Starlink satellite systems, where he designed software determining satellite beam targeting for millions of customers. ""I had a very broad scope and a lot of responsibility, especially for a junior engineer,"" Kairan Quazi told Business Insider.The Bangladeshi-American teenager will live within walking distance of Citadel Securities' Manhattan office, eliminating his previous need for his mother to drive him to work in Washington state. His mother's background as an investment banker provided early exposure to finance, making the transition feel natural despite his engineering roots.","Kairan quazi, 16, is leaving spacex to join citadel securities.

A strategic start to Hajj 1447

Saudi Arabia has officially begun preparations for the 1447 AH (2026) Hajj season, just weeks after the conclusion of Hajj 2025. A high-level coordination meeting in Makkah, led by top regional officials and involving over 40 agencies, marked the launch of planning efforts aimed at enhancing services, integrating operations, and adopting technology to improve the pilgrim experience.Deputy Emir of Makkah, Prince Saud bin Mishaal bin Abdulaziz, officially inaugurated a high-level panel meeting focused on preparations for the 1447 AH Hajj season. The session took place on Wednesday and was held under the patronage of Prince Khalid Al-Faisal bin Abdulaziz — Advisor to the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, Governor of Makkah Region, and Chairman of the Permanent Committee for Hajj and Umrah.Organized jointly by the Principality of Makkah Region and the Hajj Projects Management Office under the Pilgrim Experience Program — a key component of Saudi Vision 2030 — the meeting signals the beginning of strategic planning for the 2026 pilgrimage.The initiative follows the Kingdom’s long-standing practice of initiating preparations immediately after the conclusion of the previous Hajj season.The meeting’s discussions drew heavily on the operational outcomes of the 1446 AH (2025) Hajj season. Participants analyzed performance, service delivery, and logistical challenges with a view to replicating and improving upon the successes achieved.In his keynote remarks, Prince Saud bin Mishaal emphasized the weight of the responsibility borne by all agencies involved.“This is a great responsibility,” he said, “requiring us to redouble our efforts and integrate our roles to achieve our hopes and aspirations. The honor of serving the pilgrims requires us all to consolidate our previous successes, plan ahead, and work continuously to achieve a successful Hajj. Let the best be our ambition.”The Prince reiterated that the planning aligns closely with the directives of Saudi leadership, which consistently prioritizes the safety, comfort, and spiritual fulfillment of pilgrims. A key goal remains to ensure pilgrims can perform their rituals in both security and tranquility.The panel brought together representatives from over 40 different entities — spanning government ministries, security bodies, and service providers. These stakeholders are directly involved in managing the complex ecosystem that supports millions of pilgrims during Hajj.Core topics of discussion included:Special attention was given to improving integration between departments and ensuring that technological solutions are aligned with on-ground operational needs.The 2026 Hajj preparations represent more than just logistical planning; they mark an ongoing national commitment to excellence in pilgrim service — a central theme of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030.

"Movement signatures: How we move, gesture, use facial expressions is unique; could be as different as fingerprint",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/movement-signatures-how-we-move-gesture-use-facial-expressions-could-be-as-unique-as-fingerprint/articleshow/123483187.cms,"



MANCHESTER: The way someone walks, talks, smiles, or gestures gives a clue to who they are. Whether through the flick of an eyebrow, the rhythm of our walk, or the tilt of a head, movement speaks volumes.And my recent paper shows that people may have their own movement fingerprint. This is a style of movement that is characteristic of a person's identity. So, someone who uses expressive facial gestures might also speak with animated hand movements or walk with a lively gait. These consistencies could form a motion fingerprint that is unique to the individual.First, let's explore how faces move and why this matters.Everyone has their own style of moving their face, for example, how they raise an eyebrow, purse their lips, or squint when laughing. These patterns of movement help us recognise familiar people even when the visual quality is poor, such as in low lighting or from a distance. And as a person becomes more familiar to us, we become tuned to the way they move, learning their unique patterns of motion, just like we remember their face or voice.Human faces are constantly in motion; they blink, smile, grimace and talk, to name a few movements. Researchers categorise facial motion into rigid movements (such as turning or nodding the head) and non-rigid movements (like expressing emotion or speaking). It's the non-rigid movements that tend to be most personally distinctive.The way we gesture with our hands, shift our posture and tilt our heads all carry identity information. Gestures are often shaped by personal habits or cultural norms; for example, someone might habitually nod three times when agreeing, or use a distinctive hand wave common in their home country.Facial movements are synchronised with the way we sound. When we talk, our face plays a role in shaping the sound of our voice. For example, if you talk with a wide open mouth, your speech sounds deeper and richer. Studies show that people can match other people's voices to moving faces more accurately than to static ones. This suggests that dynamic cues to identity are present in the movement of the face and the sound of the voice.People with face recognition difficulties (those who are ""face blind"" or prosopagnosic) may be better at recognising moving faces than still ones. Typically, people who are face blind can see faces and the differences between them, but struggle to link the face to a specific person. Here, idiosyncratic information from movement can provide an additional clue to identity.Gait, a person's walking style, is one of the most studied body movements. Early research, such as a 2005 study, investigated participants' recognition of identity from gait using point-light displays. In this case, bright spots (lights) were placed on key areas of a person's body. All other visual cues were removed. Participants could only see bright spots against a dark background. The study found participants could tell fairly well who someone was from the way the spots moved.Characteristics such as stride length, limb movement, posture and pace form a consistent motion pattern that is unique and surprisingly difficult to fake, making gait analysis a reliable clue for identifying people.Movement fingerprintsMy review brought together evidence from behavioural and brain imaging studies to consider if such consistencies between different types of motion exist and how we might explore this phenomenon further. The paper proposes that people have an overall style of movement.More work needs to be done to find direct evidence of movement fingerprints. For example, we still aren't sure what part of the brain processes these movement-based identity cues.So far, research shows that the posterior temporal sulcus - an area of the brain located roughly above your ear on each side - responds not just to faces and bodies, but to how someone moves more generally. This area is active when we hear voices or see people speak, suggesting it may help link motion and sound. Also, this region plays a key role in allowing us to understand our social world, interpreting other people's actions, determining where they are looking, and picking up on social cues such as gestures, facial expressions and changes in gaze direction.However, it's probably just one part of a larger brain network involved in recognising others through motion.Real-world applicationsMotion-based identity traits aren't as stable or specific as fingerprints or DNA. They're what researchers call soft biometrics: useful but not always accurate.But as we better understand the link between motion and identity, exciting real-world applications are emerging.Motion analysis could support contactless identity verification from gait-based authentication at airports to gesture-based identification in smart environments, such as homes that respond to a user's unique movement patterns. In clinical settings, movement analysis might help support people with social cognition impairments, face recognition or movement issues. For example, helping a doctor identify changes in the way a patient produces non-verbal cues.But many questions remain. We still aren't sure how consistent motion fingerprints are as someone gets older and in different contexts. Individual differences in people and environmental factors like lighting, clothing or stress could affect them.Researchers also aren't sure how exactly we manage to understand all this movement in everyday life without even thinking about it.Figuring this out could not only help improve technologies like social robots and develop tools for people with recognition and communication difficulties, but also tell us more about how we process and react to other people.

Wealth, identity, and public image

Sheikha Mahra of Dubai has stepped into the spotlight not just as a royal or entrepreneur, but as a figure of significant financial standing. With deep roots in the ruling Al Maktoum family and an expanding personal brand, she commands an impressive net worth, one that reflects both inheritance and initiative.Sheikha Mahra is the daughter of Dubai’s ruler and a well-known figure in Emirati high society. While her family’s collective wealth is estimated to be between $18 to $20 billion, Mahra's individual net worth is considerable in its own right.Estimates of her personal wealth range from $300 million to as high as $1.5 billion. This fortune is built on a mix of family inheritance and her own ventures. A more conservative valuation places her net worth at around $300 million, though some reports go slightly lower or higher depending on how assets are calculated.She is known to have access to a luxury lifestyle, which includes a collection of high-end vehicles such as Rolls-Royce, Lamborghini, and Ferrari. There are also speculative figures suggesting her monthly income is in the range of $5 million, though these are unofficial.After going through a highly publicized divorce, Sheikha Mahra entered the business world with a striking debut, launching her own luxury perfume label under the brand “Mahra M1.”Her first product, a fragrance titled “Divorce,” was priced at $272 per bottle and attracted instant attention both for its name and for the timing of its release. It wasn’t just a business venture, it was a personal statement. Bold and symbolic, the launch helped redefine her public image and introduced Mahra as a serious entrepreneur.The Mahra M1 brand quickly positioned itself as more than a one-time headline. It marked the beginning of a long-term business vision focused on high-end, statement-driven luxury products. M1 is now recognized as a growing personal enterprise and a direct contributor to her increasing net worth.This move into entrepreneurship not only broadened her financial portfolio but also showcased her intent to move beyond her royal lineage and establish financial independence through calculated branding and business acumen.Born in 1994, she pursued her education abroad, completing a degree in International Relations in London, and later enrolled at a government administration college in Dubai.In 2023, she married Sheikh Mana bin Mohammed bin Rashid bin Mana Al Maktoum. The couple welcomed a daughter in May 2024. However, by July 2024, Mahra publicly announced their divorce in a candid social media post, invoking the Islamic triple talaq. The directness of the announcement drew wide attention, as it was rare for a royal to handle such personal matters so publicly.Following the divorce, she turned her focus to building her personal brand and business, launching Mahra M1 and becoming increasingly visible at social events and business circles across Dubai and internationally.In 2025, she was frequently seen at global events alongside American rapper French Montana. The relationship became public, and during Paris Fashion Week in June 2025, the couple confirmed their engagement. They were later seen together at various iconic Paris locations and industry functions, drawing significant media attention.Despite being born into immense privilege, Sheikha Mahra has crafted a public identity that moves beyond her royal title. Her net worth—independently estimated between $300 million and $1.5 billion, underscores her evolving role as not just a royal, but a business-minded individual shaping her own narrative.Her story is marked by strategic pivots, transforming personal chapters into professional moves. The Mahra M1 brand played a critical role in that transformation, redefining her image from royal daughter to luxury entrepreneur. She has also built a social presence rooted in individuality, decision-making, and global relevance.From building a commercial brand to forging high-profile connections, Sheikha Mahra is leveraging her background to create new avenues of financial and cultural influence, making her one of the most closely watched royals in the region today.","Sheikha mahra is the daughter of dubai’s ruler and a well-known figure in emirati high society.
