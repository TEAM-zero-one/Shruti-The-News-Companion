Going off-patent

10.1cr Indians live with diabetes, most end up paying out of pocket

NEW DELHI: Several domestic drug companies are set to transform diabetes therapy by launching the blockbuster drug Empagliflozin at a fraction of the innovator’s price.Affordable generics will hit the market within days, following the expiry of Boehringer Ingelheim’s patent on Empagliflozin on March 11, industry sources told TOI.The launch of generic Empagliflozin , used to treat diabetes, related comorbidities, including heart failure, promises to slash therapy costs, making it more accessible to millions of diabetics and easing the financial strain of this debilitating disease. Those looking to launch the drug include Mankind Pharma , Torrent, Alkem, Dr Reddy’s and Lupin.Mankind Pharma, India’s fourth-largest firm by market share, plans to offer Empagliflozin at one-tenth the innovator’s Rs 60 per tablet, sources said.Most generic versions will cost Rs 9-14 per tablet, disrupting the high-growth diabetes therapy market valued at nearly Rs 20,000 crore, up 43% from Rs 14,000 crore in 2021.The market was further bolstered by Torrent Pharmaceuticals’ acquisition of three Empagliflozin brands from Boehringer Ingelheim last year. With India facing a staggering public health burden—10.1 crore people live with diabetes, according to International Diabetes Federation— this shift is critical.“This aligns with our philosophy of breaking cost barriers with a high-quality product (raw materials certified by regulators like the USFDA) at an affordable price. Using our own active pharmaceutical ingredient in bulk lowers costs, and we will deploy separate teams to promote two distinct brands, boosting distribution and market share,” said a Mankind Pharma executive.The market size of Empagliflozin and its combinations is estimated at Rs 640 crore. Experts highlight its ability to significantly reduce heart failure hospitalisations, slow chronic kidney disease progression and improve survival in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, though high pricing has long limited access.Metformin remains the first-line treatment for type-2 diabetes, but as the disease progresses, additional medications—such as Sulfonylureas (glimepiride, glyburide, glipizide, chlorpropamide), DPP-4 Inhibitors (sitagliptin, vildagliptin), and SGLT2 Inhibitors (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin)—are added. Now, newer therapies like semaglutide and tirzepatide enhance management, offering improved glycemic control and cardiovascular benefits.The economic burden of diabetes weighs heavily in India, where most patients pay out-of-pocket due to limited medical reimbursement. Treatment costs escalate with complications, magnifying the challenge.","Affordable generics will hit the market within days, following the expiry of boehringer ingelheim’s patent on empagliflozin.

NEW DELHI: The first rear fuselage for the Tejas Mark-1A jet produced by the private sector was handed over to defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), which is struggling to produce the indigenous fighter, in the presence of defence minister Rajnath Singh in Bengaluru on Sunday.“This is a testimony to India’s progress towards Aatmanirbharta in defence and the govt’s commitment towards enhanced public-private partnership. HAL and the private sector are playing a key role in strengthening the armed forces with the latest platforms and technologies,” Singh said, in the presence of IAF chief Air Chief Marshal A P Singh. “HAL, through its integrated model and strategies, is not only bolstering India’s defence capabilities but also adding new dimensions to Indian defence manufacturing ,” Singh added.HAL had placed orders with various Indian private companies such as L&T, Alpha Tocol Engineering Services, Tata Advanced Systems Ltd, VEM Technologies and Lakshmi Mission Works for supplying major modules for the Tejas Mark-1A fighters.This comes even as the IAF chief has publicly lashed out at HAL in recent weeks.The IAF till now has got 38 of the first 40 Tejas Mark-1 fighters ordered for Rs 8,802 crore under two contracts inked in 2006 and 2010. The first “improved” Tejas Mark-1A jet, out of the 83 contracted from HAL under the Rs 46,898 crore deal in Feb 2021, is yet to be delivered. The order for another 97 Tejas Mark-1A fighters for Rs 67,000 crore is also in the pipeline. The almost two-year delay in delivery of 99 GE-404 engines by US firm General Electric is one of the main reasons for the delay in the Tejas fighters.The MoD, on its part, said HAL has already manufactured 12 rear fuselages for the Tejas Mark-1A fighters, which are on the aircraft in the manufacturing line. “With this supply, a major structure module produced by an Indian private partner will be integrated into the Mark-1A aircraft, enabling HAL to meet additional delivery commitments for the IAF from 2025-26 onwards,” an official said.",The first rear fuselage for the tejas mark-1a jet produced by the private sector was handed over to defence psu hindustan aeronautics limited (hal) in bengaluru on sunday.

Travis Kelce’s generous donation for homeless teenagers reflects Taylor Swift’s influence on his heart,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/travis-kelces-generous-donation-for-homeless-teenagers-reflects-taylor-swifts-influence-on-his-heart/articleshow/118849948.cms,"Image via Getty Images

Travis Kelce’s romance with Taylor Swift appears to be molding not only his career and wardrobe but also his life

Love can change things, and for NFL super star Travis Kelce , his relationship with Taylor Swift seems to be influencing more than the way he plays and dresses. Over the winter, he did something remarkable beyond opulence by converting a $3.3 million Kansas City mansion into a space with a greater purpose.The 6,500-square-foot home now houses a refuge for homeless teenagers . Run by nonprofit Foster Love, the house gives homeless teens a much-needed stable environment and access to resources so they can get a new beginning.Love has the ability to change individuals, and for NFL player Travis Kelce, his romance with Taylor Swift appears to be molding not only his career and wardrobe but also his life. This year, he made a big leap toward making an enduring difference by turning a $3.3 million Kansas City estate into something much greater than an upscale residence—a sanctuary for homeless adolescents.Rather than being merely another luxury property, the six-bedroom, 6,500-square-foot home is currently a transitional living home run by the non-profit Foster Love. Intended to bring stability and support, the home boasts five bathrooms, a large kitchen, and welcoming outdoor areas, such as a garden, patio, and fire pit.Far from simply a cozy setting, it provides young individuals in need a place to reconstruct their lives and gain a sense of security. Speaking on the impact, the foundation stated, “The facility also includes a game room and study area, giving young residents a place to relax and focus on their future.”Kelce bought the property in January and formally donated it in March, but why did he do so? Some think Taylor Swift's altruistic power was involved. The pop icon is famous for giving back to charity with the money she makes, and her kindness has been well-documented.As recently as last year, Swift was in the news for awarding enormous bonuses to her Eras Tour staff and donating $250,000 to Operation Breakthrough, a Kansas City-based charity supported by Kelce for many years. Most recently, she gave to ten various organizations offering relief to the victims of the Los Angeles wildfires. Given her long history of giving back, it wouldn't be surprising if Swift's dedication to philanthropy urged Kelce to make a positive impact in his own manner.Kelce and Swift's generosity is commendable, but the ethics of hoarding such wealth are questioned. Swift's net worth of $1.6 billion raises questions about the system, as it takes the average American over 16,000 years to reach $1 billion. It raises questions about the broken system that allows a pop star to achieve such wealth in just over a decade.Also Read: “A hot date night in NYC”: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce spotted together for the first time since Super Bowl LVIII Swift and Kelce's charitable actions demonstrate that wealth can be used for good, benefiting vulnerable youth in Kansas City. Kelce's gift, influenced by his girlfriend or worldview, is a play worth celebrating.","Travis kelce bought a $3.3 million mansion in january and donated it in march.

Will Michelle Obama speak about 'divorce' in new podcast with brother?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/will-michelle-obama-speak-about-divorce-in-new-podcast-with-brother/articleshow/118858094.cms,"Michelle Obama is launching a new podcast amid divorce rumors with Barack.

Will Michelle speak about 'divorce'?



Former first lady Michelle Obama will host a new weekly podcast series starting this month -- with her brother Craig Robinson which will have a special guest every episode from the world of entertainment, sports, health and business. Names of some of the guests have already been revealed. Actors Issa Rae and Keke Palmer and psychologist Dr Orna Guralnik, filmmakers Seth and Lauren Rogan; soccer star Abby Wambach; authors Jay Shetty, Glennon Doyle and Logan Ury; editor Elaine Welteroth; radio personality Angie Martinez; media mogul Tyler Perry; actor Tracee Ellis Ross; husband-and-wife athlete and actor Dwyane Wade and Gabrielle Union; and Airbnb CEO Brian Chesky are lined up, a press release said.“IMO with Michelle Obama & Craig Robinson” will address “everyday questions shaping our lives, relationships and the world around us,” according to the press release. IMO stands for “in my opinion.”The first two episodes — the first is an introductory one and the second features Rae — will premiere on March 12. New episodes will be released weekly and will be available on all audio platforms and YouTube.The news of the new podcast came as Michelle Obama has been missing in action for long and Barack Obama has been spotted solo at least on three occasions. As the scenario led to divorce rumors and rumors of Barack Obama's affair with Jennifer Anniston, the Obamas kept on posting sweet posts for each other on birthdays, and Valentine's Day but were not seen together.In the first two episodes, as reviewed by the New York Times, Michelle Obama spoke about divorce -- his brother's divorce from his first wife Janis Robinson that took place in 2000. Craig is the executive director of the National Association of Basketball Coaches.NYT reported that the brother-sister duo also discussed Michelle's marriage with Obama in the first two episodes and Michelle's relationship with politics. And politics is not something the podcast will serve owing to Michelle's strong aversion to it. Michelle and Robinson talked about their tough upbringing in Chacogo where they shared a room in a small apartment.","Former first lady michelle obama will host a new weekly podcast series starting this month with her brother craig robinson.

'She's faking it for the cameras': Meghan Markle's father blasts her new Netflix cookery show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/shes-faking-it-for-the-cameras-meghan-markles-father-blasts-her-new-netflix-cookery-show/articleshow/118855446.cms,"This image released by Netflix shows Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, left, and Mindy Kaling in a scene from ""With Love, Meghan."" (Netflix via AP)

With Love,

Meghan

With Love, Meghan

The Duchess of Sussex , in the second episode of her new Netflix cookery show, shares how her passion for jam-making stems from childhood memories of her grandmother making apple butter. However, her estranged father, 80-year-old Thomas Markle Sr , has criticised the series, claiming Meghan has ""never been authentic"" and that ""she's faking it for the cameras.""He said that whilst his mother Doris, who passed away in 2011, deeply cared for Meghan, she would be distressed by her granddaughter's recent statements. ""I haven't seen the show but I've seen a ton of clips and I've read many stories. I might sit down and watch it one day but I'm not sure,"" Meghan’s father, Thomas Markle Sr told The Daily Mail on Sunday.During the show, viewers noticed an interaction between Meghan and Mindy Kaling , where Meghan interrupts her friend for using ' Meghan Markle ', stating: ""It's so funny you keep saying 'Meghan Markle', you know I'm 'Sussex' now.""Thomas responded: ""My mum loved Meghan very much but she would be so disappointed to hear that Meghan no longer wants to use the name ""Markle."" He further remarked sarcastically: ""Now I have to say, I am Meghan Sussex's dad.""Thomas, a seasoned Hollywood professional who has worked on shows like Married… with Children and General Hospital, shared insights from his industry experience, stating that: ""Cooking shows are horrendously boring unless the presenter has a passion for it.""""You have to be authentic to hold people’s attention. When you are stuffing the turkey’s ass it has to look like you’re having fun doing it. Unfortunately Meghan has never been authentic. She has to think about everything. She's not spontaneous. Everything she says is pre-planned and rehearsed. It makes me laugh because I know all her looks and expressions,"" the retired TV lighting director, said.He continued: ""I know when she's faking it for the cameras. She's trying so hard to be perfect that she tenses up every time the camera is on her.""""The best cooks are funny, they mess up, they are human. She just wants to be perfect. It’s sad because she’s trying so hard to stay in the limelight,"" he added.In the Netflix series, Meghan portrayed herself as a ""latchkey kid"" and discussed her supposedly modest upbringing, claiming regular consumption of fast food and TV dinners stating that: ""I grew up with a lot of fast food and also a lot of TV tray dinners. It feels like such a different time but that was so normal with the microwavable kids meals.'Thomas countered this narrative, explaining, ""We occasionally ate TV dinners, which family doesn’t?’ But I was working two jobs so money was never an issue. We would eat out at least three times a week and order in the rest of the time.""Contrary to claims of a fast-food upbringing, Meghan regularly visited Musso & Frank, an upscale Hollywood establishment operating since 1919, which was her preferred dining spot.Thomas elaborated: ""Like any single father who did a long day's work, I'd occasionally put a TV dinner in the microwave. But most of the time we'd go out. After school I would either pick her up myself and we'd go out to eat or I'd send a car to bring her to the set. She grew up on the sets I worked on. She was never a latchkey kid.""He noted that whilst his former spouse excelled at cooking, Meghan showed limited interest in culinary pursuits during her childhood. He considers her current show disconnected from everyday reality.""Meghan should make affordable food and show people how to stretch their food budget,"" he suggested further adding that, ""The women who watch Meghan's show are not all rich and privileged. I think people would love it if she focused on more economical dishes.""These statements follow recent criticism from Thomas Markle Jr, who disputed Meghan's childhood accounts in her Netflix programme.""That's just another one of the malarkey stories she sold to the royal family for sympathy,"" Thomas Jr. told TalkTV, having not communicated with the duchess for over ten years.""We weren't poor. She didn't have to rub two nickels together at Sizzler's salad bar. The entire world knows how she treated her family, especially her father, who gave her everything. That’s why nobody’s buying it,"" he added.Last week, it was revealed that the second season ofhas already been filmed and is set to premiere on Netflix this summer. The series is part of the Sussexes' five-year, $100 million deal with the streaming giant, which is set to expire in October. However, many in Hollywood speculate that Netflix may opt not to renew the agreement.","Thomas markle sr, 80, has criticised the series, claiming meghan has ""never been authentic"" he said that whilst his mother doris, who passed away in 2011, deeply cared for meghan, she would be distressed by her granddaughter's recent statements.

Kylie Kelce’s Strict Parenting Rule: Why Her Kids Are Banned from Phones



Kylie on Embarrassing Vegas Nights, Flip-Flop Aversions & Bikini Skiing with Chelsea Handler | Ep 12

Kylie Kelce , wife of former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce , has been making waves with her popular podcast Not Gonna Lie with Kylie Kelce, where she openly shares her experiences as a mother. With three daughters—Wyatt, Ellie, and Bennett—already part of the Kelce household and a fourth child on the way, Kylie has implemented a strict rule when it comes to technology: her children are not allowed to use or own phones.In the latest episode of her podcast, Kylie Kelce explained how she ensures her children grow up with a balanced approach to technology. While she does allow them to watch shows on tablets, smartphones are completely off-limits.“They are not allowed to touch phones,” Kylie stated. “That has been a rule from the very beginning. Occasionally, they will borrow someone’s phone and take pictures. Wyatt is really into taking selfies right now. Dad’s really thrilled about that one.”The Kelce household operates with a structured approach to screen time. Kylie admitted that while her daughters do watch content on tablets, she cleverly manages their usage. “I will pretend that I set a timer and I will tell them, ‘One more,’” she shared. “If my task that I was trying to complete is not finished, I will say, ‘You guys were so well behaved, I’ll let you watch one more.’”This strategy allows her to control their exposure while ensuring they remain engaged in other aspects of childhood beyond screens.Kylie has never shied away from discussing the real challenges of motherhood. On the January 23rd episode of her podcast, she described raising children as the “most selfless” and “all-encompassing” thing a person can do.""At any point in the day, you do have to always be concerned about the tiny humans you're responsible for, but I think there is a misconception that it wipes out the rest of you and makes you solely mom,"" Kylie explained.She further emphasized the importance of maintaining individuality while embracing motherhood. ""Whereas what we need to do is tack it on to the end of the resume and keep the rest of the s--- that also defines us as who we are as people because we're still us,"" she continued. ""Just because we made a human being or we are a mother to a tiny human doesn't mean that we are only mom.""Kylie Kelce’s Not Gonna Lie podcast has rapidly grown in popularity, reaching No. 1 on some platforms and amassing over 290,000 YouTube subscribers. Many of her episodes garner six-digit viewership, solidifying her presence in media.Meanwhile, Jason Kelce has also built a successful career post-football, co-hosting the New Heights podcast with his brother, Kansas City Chiefs TE Travis Kelce , as well as contributing to ESPN and other NFL coverage.Also Read: Caitlin Clark confidently names her all-time favorite NFL player – No second thoughts needed With their fourth child on the way, the Kelce household is about to get even busier.

What is deflation and why are economists worried?

The ongoing price decreases have negatively impacted business earnings, employee compensation and government revenue. Sustained deflation could potentially result in diminished business investments and reduced consumer spending, says a Bloomberg report.

What’s causing deflation?

Four Flash Sales in a day in China



Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





Rising prices or inflation is a common headache for economies around the world. But what about falling prices? Believe it or not, a sustained fall in prices, commonly known as deflation, is just as big a concern for governments, as is inflation. And, that’s the issue that the world’s second largest economy, China, is grappling with!Recent data indicates China's consumer price index declined by 0.7% year-on-year in February, falling short of projections, whilst producer prices decreased by 2.2%, continuing a downward trend since September 2022.China’s expanding industrial capacity has contributed to export growth, yet it is simultaneously creating deflationary pressures domestically.According to a Reuters report, February's consumer price index recorded its steepest decline in 13 months, alongside persistent producer price deflation. This downturn reflects reduced seasonal demand and consumer hesitancy in spending, influenced by employment and income uncertainties.Also Read | ‘Elon Musk doing amazing work, but…’: Why Sajjan Jindal believes Tesla won’t find it easy in India Following Beijing's recent pledge to enhance consumption amidst escalating US trade tensions, analysts anticipate continued deflationary pressures in China's economy, the report said.Deflation occurs when prices of goods and services decrease across the board. During such periods, currency value increases with time. For many years, economists have expressed concerns about deflation.Whilst deflation appears advantageous for consumers, who can buy more with their income over time, the effects of falling prices are not universally beneficial. Economists worry about how price decreases affect different economic sectors.Also Read | Donald Trump's tariffs: India may be among least vulnerable Asian economies in trade war with US - but there's a catch! China's deepening deflationary concerns may continue beyond temporary seasonal variations, unless governmental action addresses the surplus production capacity that's affecting price levels.Financial institutions such as Citigroup Inc. and Nomura Holdings Inc. express concern that consumer prices might remain near negative territory throughout the year if domestic production continues to exceed consumer demand.With the People's Bank of China currently focusing on maintaining yuan stability rather than implementing monetary stimulus, addressing deflation will likely depend on policymakers' success in managing excess production capacity, the Bloomberg report said.As noted by Citigroup economists, including Xinyu Ji, whilst rebuilding consumer confidence could require several months and largely depends on property market stabilisation, China's approach to supply-side reforms would be crucial for addressing factory-level deflation.China's rising youth joblessness, at 15.7%, is affecting consumer spending. With employment and income uncertainties, Chinese shoppers are increasingly patronising discount retailers, even as industrial production grows despite weak household spending.Financial experts indicate that the growth of such discount businesses is contributing to deflationary trends, which could impact economic growth as these shops gain popularity over traditional retailers, similar to Japan's experience in the 1990s.""The broader shift toward more value-for-money purchases will play a role in deflationary pressures,"" Lynn Song, chief Greater China economist at ING was quoted as saying by Reuters.""This sort of intense price competition likely adds some pressure on more traditional retail models as well,” Song said.Also Read | Q3 FY25 GDP grows at 6.2%; India sees 'highest growth in 12 years' in FY24 - top 10 data points to know In its report, Reuters quoted an interesting example, symptomatic of China’s deflation.At the expansive Wankelai establishment in Beijing, manager Leo Liu conducts sales through a microphone, offering increasingly substantial discounts during flash sales until he successfully sells items including a cotton jacket and a ladies' undershirt.Reflecting China's deflationary economic conditions, Liu secured a buyer for the jacket at 20 yuan, a fraction of its original 239 yuan ($33) price tag. The 39-yuan undershirt had to be given away as no customers were willing to purchase it!The store, which offers clothing, snacks and everyday household items near Beijing's financial district, conducts these sales four times daily!Widespread price reductions have emerged across sectors, from eateries offering 3-yuan breakfast deals to automotive manufacturer BYD reducing one of its vehicle prices to under $10,000.Local coffee chain Luckin has overtaken Starbucks as the market leader by offering more affordable options.","Deflation occurs when prices of goods and services decrease across the board.

Imagination Over Documentation: A Fresh Look at Dutch Art,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/imagination-over-documentation-a-fresh-look-at-dutch-art/articleshow/118836767.cms,"Laura Cummings Challenges 'Photographic' View of Dutch Paintings

Q:

How do you manage to write under the pressure of the standards you set for yourself?

A:

Q:

While I was reading your books, I kept thinking you're writing self-portraits, but in a sense, a self-portrait of you emerges as well, along with your parents. And it's a leisurely pace, as if one was walking through a museum.

A:

Q:

In your books you talk about the cultural and the socioeconomic context, and the lives that these individual artists lived. And you also do it in your analysis of artists who are women.

A:

Q:

What I marvel at is how your writing styles are so distinct in your three books that I've seen. And yet it's you.

A:

Listen here:Excerpts from the interview:I write about art during the week for my newspaper, The Observer, with what I think of as my right hand. I write about art for my books, art and life and the intersection between them, which is my special subject, with my left hand, if you like. My brain is playing split between these two worlds, between the professional commitments for my newspaper and then for book writing, which is where I feel a freedom and a comfort and a different kind of audience and a different kind of time scheme. And one is able to tell stories at length about painters and life and culture, and, in my case, in the new book, about sudden death and accidents and my father, who flew planes in India, in fact, in the Second World War.The way you describe that perfectly goes to my experience of museums and of looking at art, which all of the people listening will know, which is that when you're in a museum, you miss paintings. There are crowds in front of paintings. There are paintings that you feel are very particularly yours because you found them and you're alone looking at them. And I think of museums as being almost like cities where people walk and they see other people. In the case of artworks, I'm thinking of them as having a kind of personality. I feel that museums are like the places that we live. And they're not very different to me, in my mind. And all of the books that I have written do have moments I've described in the current book 'Thunderclap. They are moments where a person, particularly painters, see a work of art and there's a huge moment, and the feeling that you are seeing something really radically connected to you and only to you, and everybody has a different experience of everything. All of my books are arguing the same thing, which is that the human relationship with art is entirely personal.I always feel that I'm a bit mutinous, about art historians, because with regard to Dutch art, and this very much goes to women painting in the mid century, in the 17th century, we're always being told what to see, what to think. This is a symbol. Here is a skull. It must be about death. Here's a piece of cheese, maybe that's about death… Dutch art is very particularly supposedly full of these, you know, warnings against mortality and vanity and so on, but they really aren't. So one argument about Dutch art is that it's all symbolic. And I think, no, they're not. They're about the incredible beauty of the world and the amazing way that light gives its grace to everything that we look at around us and so on. And they're about the wonder of art, and they're not about something very simple. And. And what is always said about Dutch art, and I think completely wrongly, is that it's a sequence of photographs. And it's so democratic, it's so all embracing, and it's so infinite in its reach through everything that you can see. Everything is imagined, remarked upon, remembered, felt and painted by the artists.I can't paint and I can't sculpt. And I'm terrible at taking photographs, but I appreciate them enormously. So the only thing I have is words because I can't draw. And if I could draw, maybe I would be making art. But as it is, I have the thing I have which is just words and practice with words and so on. So I'm putting words to images and things that I want to praise and things that I want the viewer to see. And it arrives out of the fact that I couldn't be an artist because I had no talent.","Laura cummings challenges 'photographic' view of dutch paintings. Cummings: 'i can't paint and i can't sculpt.

SPLIT (CROATIA): In AD 301, Emperor Diocletian made a bold but ultimately unsuccessful bid to address the inflation that was rampaging across the eastern half of the divided Roman Empire. Prices of everything from purple thread and feathers to cattle were dictated by his Edict on Maximum Prices. Violators faced the death penalty. Diocletian gave up power about four years after issuing his edict, watching his measure fail from his sprawling retirement palace in the heart of what became the city of Split in Croatia.Now Croatia’s govt is trying a similar tactic to rein in prices, which have soared in recent years and have sparked protests and retail boycotts by the country’s beleaguered consumers. The govt introduced price controls for retailers last month, targeting supermarket items such as bread, pork and shampoo. The penalties are less drastic than those decreed by Diocletian, mandating a fine of up to €30,000, for retailers breaking the rules. It is unclear whether the new edict will be any more successful than Diocletian’s, which economists say ended up being counterproductive by causing shortages, fuelling a black market and enabling profiteers. For the moment, consumers are still figuring out how to navigate the new system, which caps the price of 70 common grocery store products.Anita Kargotic, 62, went shopping recently at a Spar supermarket, where two signs were posted outside listing the maximum prices allowed for a range of goods. She tied her American Akita, named Maja, to a post outside, and later emerged from the store with a haul of kaiser rolls, popcorn kernels, soy flakes and crackers. Most were store-brand gene rics, already less expensive than more recognisable labels.Flea collars and dry dog food? Those are necessities. Grapes? No, too expensive. Staples like rice and pasta? Pass. “Those prices have become completely unreasonable,” she said.The new rules are the govt’s third attempt at controlling prices by fiat since Sept 2022. The first two efforts were largely ineffective, with retailers simply refusing to stock most pricecontrolled goods. The govt says it is serious this time, and it has promised regular inspections and fines for violators.Under the new rules brought in by PM Andrej Plenkovic, shop entrances must display a list of all 70 items that fall under the govt’s pricing regulations. Centuries ago, Diocleti an’s edict accused some citizens of price gouging and said their greed needed to be reined in. In Jan, Plenkovic struck a similar tone. “We support companies that work well and make a profit, but within realistic frames. That can’t be at the expense of the little guy,” he said.Many people say price controls are not the answer. John H. Cochrane, an economist, pointed to the role Diocletian’s edict played in causing shortages and fuelling a black market. “It’s like trying to stem the symptoms rather than treating the underlying disease,” Cochrane said of price controls.","Croatia's govt introduced price controls for retailers last month, targeting supermarket items such as bread, pork and shampoo.

The company has prepaid ~INR670b in high-cost spectrum debt since FY22, improving leverage. With FY25-27 FCF expected to reach ~INR500b annually, capital allocation becomes a key focus. Bharti's revenue/EBITDA is projected to grow at a 15%/19% CAGR over FY24-27, supported by tariff hikes and Indus consolidation. Key monitorables include FCF deployment and potential AGR relief.Management expects double-digit revenue growth in FY25, supported by strong demand from weddings, tourism, and MICE events. ARR and occupancy remain robust.

A healthy room addition pipeline, favorable demand-supply trends, and govt support for tourism position IH well for sustained growth. We expect revenue/EBITDA/adj.
