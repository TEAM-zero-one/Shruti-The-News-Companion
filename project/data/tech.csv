'Dairy, Agriculture Protected': Piyush Goyal Outlines 'Historic' US-India Trade Deal, Lauds PM Modi

‘Farmers understand their interests & sensitivities have been protected’

Commerce & industry minister

Piyush Goyal

always has his calendar full with meetings, and the last few weeks have been particularly hectic due to the trade deals with the EU and the US. The minister discussed the details of the US deal with

TOI’s

Sidhartha

while insisting that the agreement will help Indian exporters grow and boost two-way trade. Excerpts:

Is there a sense of relief or a sense of accomplishment?

You, your team and others in govt have been working on this for close to a year now. There were ups and downs. What was the turning point?

Modi govt has been known to be very forthright and blunt. The negotiations saw Peter Navarro, commerce secretary Howard Lutnick, treasury secretary Scott Bessent making very aggressive remarks. There was no response from India. Was it deliberate silence?

So, the two sides were making progress even when there were headlines about things sliding towards a point of no return?

You have earlier said each trade deal stands on its own legs. But sheer timing, within eight days, EU and US deals were finalised. Was the EU deal an elephant in the room as far as the Americans are concerned?

Farmers’ bodies have called for a nationwide protest on Feb 12. Do you see that as a risk to the deal?

You have agreed to review non-tariff barriers on US farm products. Second, DDGS is going to be imported. Will it be at the expense of soybean farmers because it is cheaper?

India’s purchase of Russian oil was one of the things that held up the deal. The US executive order talks abouts India stopping Russian oil purchases, but govt has remained silent on it. Can you throw some light on that?

You have lobbed the ball into MEA’s court on Russian oil. How are you going to protect energy security? In your statement in Parliament you spoke about it.

There is also mention of removing import licensing for ICT products in the joint statement. What exactly is it and, two, are we looking at a more resilient supply chain through this?

Is this review also meant to rebalance trade, some of it is coming from countries which are not seen to be very friendly?

This is the first tranche of the trade deal. What is the road ahead? Will services be part of future talks?

There is an explicit reference to the modifications in commitments in case of changes to the agreed tariff by any of the countries. Does it have to do with Trump’s unpredictable nature?

Do you see the deal lifting the cloud of uncertainty over investments which may have been on hold?

Along with the joint statement, USTR issued a map which showed PoK and Aksai Chin as part of India. Is it just a coincidence?

NEW DELHI: Commerce & industry minister Piyush Goyal said Sunday that the govt has aggressively sought to push the farm sector's interests in the US trade deal, while protecting its sensitivities around dairy and agriculture.""We have $30-odd billion of imports. The important thing is we have $55 billion of exports of farm and fish produce. So, we should have an offensive interest, which is what we have focused on simultaneously along with protecting the sensitive sectors,"" he told TOI in an interview.The deal opens the doors for several products such as tea, coffee, spices and fruits with the US allowing their import at zero reciprocal tariff, while also helping seafood exporters compete favourably as the reciprocal tariff has been slashed to 18%.The minister also said that concern over the import of distillers dried grains with solubles, a feed ingredient that is a by-product of dry-milled ethanol production, is misplaced and that India has only opened a small window. While Goyal refused to disclose details, officials said against domestic animal feed consumption of 500 lakh tonnes, the quota offered to the US is only five lakh tonnes.The minister said the demand had come from the industry itself amid rising livestock population and growing requirement for feed, especially at a time when arable land is shrinking.This was long under negotiation, though not very long by FTA standards. It is very satisfying that the world’s largest democracies are coming closer together, further strengthening the most powerful relationship in the world. The US is already a $30 trillion economy and continues to grow, India, even though $4 trillion today, there is a clear roadmap given by the PM towards Viksit Bharat by 2047, we will grow to a $30-35 trillion economy, which means the delta of opportunity is huge. To be able to grab that opportunity we need to have better markets, open new vistas, attract investments, attract technologies to India. Completing EU and US trade deals in a span of eight days is quite satisfying, in a way reflective of India’s emergence as a confident nation.Trade negotiations are about crystal gazing into the future. Both sides look for the best deal, the important thing is to get the right balance, which is a win-win for both sides. As it gets closer towards completion, creating that right balance is always difficult. You are looking at protecting your sensitivities, the other side is looking at protecting their sensitivities. You are looking at your ability to gain from the agreement as is the other side. The process was a labour of love over the last 10 months. It ended on a very happy note with PM Narendra Modi and President Trump in their call last Monday deciding on closing negotiations with a rate for India, which is the best given to any of our competitors.I don’t think we were stuck on any position. I don’t think there was any acrimony on both sides throughout the negotiations. Everybody has a certain style and it’s important to appreciate that style. So, I don’t think India ever got into any misunderstandings on the trade front. Through the negotiations we kept a very good atmosphere.If you don’t misunderstand me, don’t believe the headlines. It is not for the newspapers alone, it’s for all of us. Very often we oversell our own thinking or over buy our own understanding or philosophy. One must always have the ability to listen to another new viewpoint and keep patience, particularly in trade negotiations as they are a long-drawn affair. You can’t rush things. That’s why I’ve often said never have a deadline for trade negotiations, you’ll make mistakes.It’s just that both happened within a short span of time. We are currently engaged in nearly 12-13 negotiations across the world and concluding them quite rapidly. We’ve concluded the UK, New Zealand, Oman, EU and US. There’s another one on the anvil. It reflects India’s growing confidence, growing understanding of international trade and the power of international trade. Our desire to become a developed nation by 2047 cannot be achieved unless we really look at much larger markets across the world.I don’t think so because farmer bodies also understand that we have kept the sensitivities in agriculture fully protected and excluded areas of high production in India, where we are generally self-sufficient: meat, poultry, rice, wheat, sugar, all dairy items, all GM products, soybean and corn. There’s hardly any item where any farmer can feel threatened. We have seen the import statistics. Right from Congress times, we have been importing soybean oil, tree nuts. We have heard this complaint that we have closed our doors to wines and spirits for no reason.A number of fresh and processed fruits continue to be imported. They are not available in India in sufficient measure. India imports 5.5 lakh tonnes of apples and there are certain items which India needs. We have $30-odd billion of imports. The important thing is we have $55 billion of exports of farm and fish produce. So, we should have an offensive interest, which is what we have focused on simultaneously along with protecting the sensitive sectors. American market has been opened for a large number of products for our farmers at zero reciprocal tariff, be it tea, coffee or spices, bananas, coconut, mangoes, kiwi and papaya. Trade is all about competition, comparative advantage. Now, we have the best comparative advantage. It’s for our businesses, our exporters to get the best and make the best of this wonderful deal.The concern about non-tariff barriers is totally misplaced because neither India nor US has non-tariff barriers. If there is any inadvertent or any difficulty to trade on both sides, we have agreed that we should try and smoothen the edges and speed up the benefits of this wonderful agreement. I see no reason why we should not resolve non-tariff barriers. We’ve done that in every agreement. The US has some of the best standards. India is now emerging as a high-quality producer of goods and provider of services. So, we have nothing to fear. As regards DDGS, we have a huge requirement, and it is growing. What we have agreed to is a very small quota. The animal husbandry department and industry desperately wants more DDGS because it’s a very high-quality protein. We have 194 million cattle, 112 million buffaloes and 878 million total livestock. As a govt, I have to balance all interests. But I can assure you we have protected soybeans. We are already importing $5 billion of soybean oil every year. If something was opened by UPA, let’s say for Indonesia or Japan or South Korea or Vietnam, I would rather have more competition as it gets me better price and better quality.Commerce ministry does not deal with this subject. I’m not aware of the details, another ministry deals with this.I did, but based on inputs that MEA gave me.n India needs huge quantities of ICT products for its growth and for engaging with modern technology. In the budget we announced huge concessions for data centres. But if we don’t get Nvidia chips or we don’t get AI equipment or quantum computing equipment or if we are dependent only on other geographies, we are harming our country. This was an offensive interest.India will look to get the best from around the world and at the best prices. In all of that we want to have trusted partners. Our focus is to encourage trade with trusted partners.We will first convert this into a proper agreement and legally binding agreement and thereafter we will continue to see other areas to expand trade and mutual cooperation.No. It is a general clause to make sure that the equitable agreement that we have reached continues to remain equitable.I certainly see this as a big boost for investments given that investors like predictability and stability and they love to see a strong relationship on the trade front. They can now plan investments with the confidence that import duty on their inputs are all very clear.Again, this is not my subject.","'dairy, agriculture protected': piyush goyal outlines 'historic' us-india trade deal, lauds pm modi.

"Electronics output up 6-fold, exports 8-fold in 11 yrs: Govt",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/electronics-output-up-6-fold-exports-8-fold-in-11-yrs-govt/articleshow/128084651.cms,"NEW DELHI: The smartphone in your pocket is increasingly getting a 'Made in India' backstory - and so are many of the electronic parts that power daily life. India's electronics manufacturing has grown sharply over the past 11 years, with production rising about six-fold and exports jumping eight-fold, govt told Rajya Sabha on Friday, adding that India has now emerged as the world's second-largest mobile phone manufacturer.Sharing official figures in the House, MoS for electronics and IT Jitin Prasada said electronics production climbed from about Rs 1.9 lakh crore in 2014-15 to nearly Rs 11.3 lakh crore in 2024-25, while exports rose from around Rs 0.4 lakh crore to about Rs 3.3 lakh crore over the same period.Mobiles have been the biggest growth engine. Production increased sharply from roughly Rs 0.2 lakh crore in 2014-15 to about Rs 5.5 lakh crore in 2024-25, while exports surged from nearly Rs 1,000 crore to close to Rs 2 lakh crore - a more than 100-fold rise.Govt attributed much of this momentum to production linked incentive scheme for large-scale electronics manufacturing, launched in 2020. Under the scheme, mobile phone output rose from Rs 2.14 lakh crore in 2019-20 to Rs 5.5 lakh crore in 2024-25, while exports expanded from nearly Rs 0.3 lakh crore to Rs 2 lakh crore.Officials also said India has turned into a net exporter of mobile phones, reversing its position as an importer a decade ago.Till Dec 2025, the mobile PLI scheme attracted investments of over Rs 15,000 crore and generated over 1.7 lakh additional jobs, Prasada told Parliament. He added PLI 2.0 for IT hardware, launched in 2023, has so far led to cumulative production of over Rs 16,500 crore, with investments of about Rs 857 crore and nearly 4,800 direct jobs.With factories scaling up and exports rising steadily, govt said India is strengthening its position as a reliable global hub for electronics manufacturing.","India's electronics manufacturing has grown sharply over the past 11 years.

Isro kicks off process to get special rail track system at second launch complex,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-kicks-off-process-to-get-special-rail-track-system-at-second-launch-complex/articleshow/128064659.cms,"Representative photo (PTI)

BENGALURU: Isro has begun the process to find companies that can install a sophisticated rail track system at its upcoming Second Launch Complex (SLC) in Kulasekarapattinam, which will cater to small rocket launches once it gets commissioned.The Satish Dhawan Space Centre (SDSC) has invited bids for the supply, erection, and commissioning of approximately 1,700 meters of heavy-duty rail tracks that will transport fully integrated launch vehicles from the assembly facility to the launch pad—a distance of about 740 meters.The rail system will be designed to carry the Mobile Launch Structure (MLS) loaded with the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) class of rockets, with a maximum payload capacity of 570 tonnes. The project involves installing special grade rails capable of withstanding individual bogie wheel loads of up to 100 tonnes.“This is not just a conventional rail system”, project documents accessed by TOI, read. “The tracks must maintain level differences across rails within just ±1 millimeter to ensure the stability of the launch vehicle during transportation.”The complex engineering requirements include a curved segment with a 300-meter mean radius of curvature, as well as a perpendicular cross-track system with a 9-meter gauge that will allow the MLS to be parked when not in use.A unique feature of the system is the axle-turning arrangement at track junctions, which will enable the bogie system to switch between the main track (6.5-meter gauge) and cross tracks (9-meter gauge). During this operation, the MLS will be temporarily placed on ground anchors while the bogie is lifted, manually rotated to align with the desired track direction, and then repositioned.Work is scheduled to be completed within 29 weeks of order placement, with payment terms of 100% within 30 days after successful erection, testing, and acceptance by Isro. The project includes liquidated damages of 0.5% per week for delays, capped at 10% of the total contract value.The Department of Space (DoS) had earlier said that the Kulasekarapattinam spaceport is targeted to be commissioned in the next fiscal (2026-27). The Govt has allocated nearly Rs 986 crore for the project.DoS, while detailing specific advantages of the Kulasekarapattinam launch site in terms of payload capacity and its comparison with the existing launch facility at Sriharikota, had said: “The new site will enhance payload capability of launch vehicles in the class of SSLV, while launching satellites to polar orbits.”Launches to Sun-Synchronous Polar Orbits (SSPO) from Sriharikota need maneuvering of the rocket to avoid the impact of spent stages over landmasses and this will significantly reduce the payload capability. “The payload capability of SSLV to SSPO while launching from Kulasekarapattinam is about 300kg whereas the capability is inadequate for a useful payload while launching from Sriharikota,” as per DoS.Post commissioning, the launches of SSLV and equivalent launch vehicles from the private sector are expected to be carried out from Kulasekarapattinam spaceport.","The rail system will be designed to carry the mobile launch structure (mls) loaded with the small satellite launch vehicle (sslv) class of rockets, with a maximum payload capacity of 570 tonnes.

Planning to visit a bank in February? It’s smart to check the holiday schedule first, as an unexpected closure can turn a quick errand into a wasted trip. In India, banks observe both national and state-specific holidays, so closure dates may differ from one region to another. In India, bank holidays include both national and state-specific observances, so closure dates can vary across different regions.Banks will remain closed in Sikkim on account of the Losar festival.Banks will be closed in Maharashtra for Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Jayanti.Banks will not operate in Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh in observance of State Day/Statehood Day.Apart from these, banks will also remain closed on second and fourth Saturdays of the month, according to RBI.Being aware of bank holidays in advance can help customers plan essential financial transactions and avoid last-minute hassles. While branches may remain closed on these days, it does not prevent customers from carrying out routine transactions. Digital banking services, including online banking, ATMs, mobile apps, and UPI, remain fully operational for fund transfers, bill payments, and other regular activities.However, services that require a physical visit such as large cash deposits, cheque clearances, or issuing demand drafts will not be available. To prevent inconvenience, account holders are encouraged to plan these tasks ahead and make full use of digital banking options during closures.","Banks will be closed in maharashtra for chhatrapati shivaji maharaj jayanti.

New labour code changes and why companies are making one-time provisions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-labour-code-changes-and-why-companies-are-making-one-time-provisions/articleshow/127929310.cms,"1.

MUMBAI: Most companies reporting their financial results for Q3FY26 are reporting a large one-time provison towards employee benefits attributing it to the new labour code. TOI takes a look at what brought about these changes and how does it affect stakeholders.The change relates mainly to gratuity payments under the Code on Social Security, 2020. The new rules redefine “wages” for calculating gratuity and expand eligibility for fixed-term employees.Under the revised rules, wages used to calculate gratuity must form at least 50% of an employee’s total cost-to-company (CTC). If allowances exceed 50% of CTC, the excess must be added back to wages for gratuity calculation. This increases the base on which gratuity is calculated.The law also allows fixed-term employees to become eligible for gratuity after completing one year of service instead of the earlier five-year requirement. Because of these changes, companies must account for higher future gratuity payouts, forcing them to create one-time provisions in their financial statements.The government introduced the change through the Code on Social Security, 2020, which forms part of four consolidated labour codes replacing 29 older labour laws.The codes were passed by Parliament in 2020, but detailed implementation rules were notified later.The reform aimed to simplify labour laws, improve social security coverage and reflect modern employment practices. A key concern was that many companies structured salaries with a low basic pay and high allowances to reduce statutory payouts such as provident fund and gratuity. The new definition of wages reduces this flexibility.Another trigger was the growing use of fixed-term employment across industries. The government sought to extend social security benefits to such workers, especially in sectors with high attrition and contractual hiring.The new labour codes, including the Social Security Code, came into force on November 21, 2025. While the central framework became effective from that date, states continue to finalise detailed implementation rules.Employees benefit mainly through higher gratuity payouts and wider eligibility. Because gratuity calculations now use a broader wage base, many employees will receive higher retirement or exit benefits.Fixed-term employees, who earlier did not qualify unless they completed five years of service, can now receive gratuity after one year. This benefits workers in sectors with short-term or project-based employment.The changes also aim to bring more transparency to salary structures and expand social security coverage.The financial impact varies depending on salary structure and workforce composition.Manufacturing and heavy industries: These sectors rely heavily on contract and fixed-term workers. The new rules increase gratuity liabilities and could push companies to review workforce models.Technology and IT services: These companies often use allowance-heavy salary structures. They may need to restructure compensation to meet the wage definition norms.Banking and financial services: The sector may see higher statutory benefit costs and increased liabilities for outsourced and contractual staff.Construction: The sector employs a large informal workforce. The new rules increase compliance requirements and settlement obligations.Retail and e-commerce: Companies with seasonal hiring and gig-based employment may face higher employee benefit costs and classification challenges.Healthcare: Round-the-clock operations and contract staffing could raise wage and benefit compliance costs.Manufacturing and heavy industries are expected to make the largest one-time provisions. These sectors typically have a large contract workforce, lower basic salary structures and higher dependence on fixed-term employment, which significantly increases gratuity liabilities.Technology and financial services companies are also likely to see sizeable increases due to changes in salary structure norms, though typically less than manufacturing.","Most companies reporting their financial results for q3fy26 are reporting a large one-time provison towards employee benefits.

Elon Musk in the middle of a Bad Bunny and TPUSA Super Bowl clash

Super Bowl LX viewers who planned to stream Turning Point USA’s All-American Halftime Show on X were met with an unexpected change just hours before kickoff. The alternative broadcast, promoted as a patriotic counterprogramming option during the NFL’s halftime spectacle, will no longer air on Elon Musk ’s platform. Organizers cited licensing complications as the reason behind the sudden pivot.The announcement came on Sunday, creating confusion among supporters who had prepared to watch the show through X. Instead, the group redirected its audience elsewhere, signaling that digital rights issues had forced a last minute decision.Turning Point USA addressed the situation directly in a public update. “UPDATE: Due to licensing restrictions, we are unable to stream The All-American Halftime Show on X,” its post read. “Head on over to our YouTube channel tonight around 8 PM ET to watch the full show.”The group had marketed the production as a family friendly alternative to the NFL’s official halftime event featuring Bad Bunny. In earlier promotions, it described the program in strong terms: “The All-American Halftime Show will be a unique, patriotic event proudly celebrating American culture, freedom, and faith.”However, streaming rights often differ across platforms.Music and entertainment broadcasts require strict compliance with digital licensing agreements. X operates under a different copyright framework than YouTube, which offers broader infrastructure for handling licensed performances. Rather than risk a takedown or legal complications mid stream, organizers chose to move the entire broadcast to YouTube.Although certain content information was not revealed, the shift highlights the complicated environment of live event streaming on high profile events such as the Super Bowl. In real time platforms have to strike a balance between free speech, the expectations of the audience, and the copyright legislation.For viewers, the solution is simple. The show will still go on.

Emiru comments on imitation and collaborating with lookalike streamers





Twitch streamer Emiru, popular for her content involving cosplay and gaming, has been in recent news due to her comments regarding other Twitch streamers who share similar looks and fashion sense to her. While talking to her followers in her recent video, she talked about the recent viral video involving content creator Charlie. She also included statements on how she considered working with five female Twitch streamers, who wore similar attire and had similar looks to her. The video has been gaining popularity on different social media sites, such as X and Reddit.During the stream, however, Emiru mentioned that although they might know her, some of these popular streamers may get upset if their audience mentions her name. In a humorous fashion, she even joked about whether these popular streamers are actually friends with her, whether they areor if they are copying her without giving any credits to her.From this short video, the streamer Emiru wondered out loud how interesting it would be if she gathered all her favorite women who look like her and broadcast a group stream. Of course, the excitement and joy shared by viewers of this content stemmed from their awareness of this as a witty, yet sharp, observation on imitation and admiration within the community.Emiru's comments appear to highlight the ongoing debate in the realm of online content creation, with some of them revolving around originality, recognition, and drawing such fine lines between inspiration and imitation.Some of her fans appear to take her comments in a playful sense while also recognizing the actual challenges faced by online creators when their style or their persona is copied by someone while failing to give them due credit. There also seems to be an overall focus on female streamers and their struggle for visibility and recognition in such an ever-growing field.Currently, Emiru resumes her usual streaming activities and remains active with her association with her fans through Twitch as well as other platforms. Though her comments have not generated any major controversy, these have encouraged debate among her fans regarding the activities associated with copying as well as credit in the virtual streaming scene. This clip highlights the challenges that popular streamers face in maintaining their originality, influence, and relationships with both peers and emerging creators.","Twitch streamer emiru, popular for her content involving cosplay and gaming, has been in recent news due to her comments regarding other twitch streamers who share similar looks and fashion sense to her.

According to WCNC’s Megan Divers, the NFL may cover artists’ travel costs, but the league continues its tradition of not paying performers for pregame and halftime shows beyond a [minimum union-mandated fee through SAG-AFTRA], usually about $1,000 per day for rehearsals and the performance.In short, pop superstars do not reportedly receive a massive paycheck for their grand performances. Sports Illustrated reported Usher received $671 for his 2024 performance and $1,800 for the rehearsal. According to the July 2025 Wrapbook story, the most recent SAG day rate for basic theatrical agreements was $1,246 a day.The Athletic reported that Bad Bunny is not getting much for headlining the Super Bowl LX halftime show, but superstars do it for exposure.“When you have an opportunity as an artist to stand on a stage and reach 250 million people at one time,” Jon Barker, the NFL’s senior vice president and global head of major events, told The Athletic’s Jayna Bardahl. “And that’s not counting the addition of social and streaming and the ability for people to go back and re-watch, I think that it is one of the most important stages in live entertainment.When they join us and become part of the halftime show, I think [artists] recognize what the halftime show is and being a part of it.And I think that resonates very strongly with the artists. That’s certainly the feedback we’ve heard year after year after years with artists.”Rihanna’s 2023 performance reportedly drew a record 121 million viewers. ELLE’s Moriel Mizrahi Finder and Alyssa Bailey reported that Rihanna’s halftime show led to a 640% boost in music sales.Rolling Stone reported that 2025 halftime headliner Kendrick Lamar saw a 430% jump in Spotify streams for “Not Like Us” and a 175% boost in overall Spotify streams after the performance.Billboard reported that Maroon 5’s 2019 halftime performance saw a 434% increase in sales, while Justin Timberlake’s 2018 Super Bowl show gained him a 534% sales boost.An NFL spokesperson told Forbes in 2016: ""We do not pay the artists. We cover expenses and production costs.""","The nfl does not pay performers for pregame and halftime shows beyond a minimum union-mandated fee through sag-aftra.

Oracle’s risky AI bet

Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison has now seen an unprecedented $50 billion wiped off his net worth in less than forty days this year, as per Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Ellison’s fortune stood at $199 billion by Wednesday’s (February 4) close, down sharply from $247 billion at the start of January. A single-day slump of 5% in Oracle’s stock erased about $9 billion from this wealth, deepening the decline.The round in software stocks was triggered by Anthropic’s release of plugins for its Claude Cowork AI agent, which can easily automate corporate tasks in legal, scales, finance, marketing and data analysis. Investors now fear that such tools could lead to reduction in the demand for external software from established giants such as Adobe, Salesforce, Intuit and Atlassian. Shares of all these companies tumbled earlier this week before staging a particle rebound, but Oracle’s loses remained steep.Ellison was not along in facing the sharp decline in net worth. Along with him, Tesla CEO Elon Musk also saw his net worth fall by around $11 billion, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg lost around $8 billion. On the other hand, other tech leaders like Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Jeff Bezos and Jensen Huang each shed around $5 billion as the stocks of the companies dropped by at least 2%.For those unaware, Oracle has aggressively positioned itself as an important player in the AI boom, the company has signed deals with Nvidia and OpenAI in order to offer data centers powering next-generation technology. However, its heavy spending and increasing debt have raised concerns among analysts. The company’s remaining performance obligations — contracted sales not yet recognized as revenue — surged 438% year-over-year to $523 billion as of November 30, nearly ten times its annual revenue of $53 billion.Critics believe that Oracle may be overspending. Popular American investor Michael Burry has publicly bet against Oracle. Burry has warned that the company’s debt-fueled expansion tied to AI contracts was unnecessary, calling the moves “hard to explain” and suggesting that “ego” might be driving decisions.","Ellison's fortune stood at $199 billion by wednesday’s (february 4) close, down sharply from $247 billion at the start of january.

Transfer opportunities for employees



Why Amazon is shutting down Amazon Go and Fresh stores

Amazon recently announced that it is shutting down its Amazon Fresh supermarket chain. The decision of the company to shut down the Amazon Fresh stores will lead to thousands of job cuts across the US. Last week, the e-commerce major announced that it will close around 60 Fresh stores which will put an end to the effort of six-years. As reported by Business Insider, the WARN notices filed in various states confirm the sale of layoffs. As aper the filling, in California only the company will shut down 20 Fresh stores which will affect around 3,900 workers. Most Fresh locations closed to the public on February 1, though California stores will remain open until mid-March due to state law.As Amazon is shutting down the Fresh stores, it has outlined two main options for the affected employees. The company is giving a choice to the employees in which they can either choose the severance pay or can take transfer within the company. The workers will continue to receive their normal pay and benefits for 90 days after the closure announcement, or until April 28. The compensation offered by the company will be based on either the minimum pay for their employee class of their average hours worked over the past 60 days whichever is higher.The report further adds that employees who do not secure another role within the company by late April will then receive severance packages, calculated as one week of pay for every six months of service at Amazon Fresh. Workers are guaranteed a minimum of four weeks’ pay, with the possibility of up to 20 weeks depending on tenure.For those seeking to remain within Amazon, the company is encouraging Fresh workers to apply for similar positions at Whole Foods Stores or Amazon grocery warehouse via its internal A to Z portal. An Amazon spokesperson said: “All affected employees will have the opportunity to apply for open roles within Amazon where available, and we’re providing career transition services to help them explore options.”Amazon Fresh associates typically earned between $16 and $20 per hour, according to data from job site Indeed. Their responsibilities ranged from picking delivery orders to handling checkout operations.Amazon Go and Fresh stores were introduced as Just Walk Out technology, but they struggled to establish a distinctive customer experience and sustainable economic model. On the other hand, Whole Food Market acquired in 2017 by Amazon say strong growth with sales rising more than 40% in recent years. Also, Amazon’s online grocery business also witnessed a surge with perishable grocery sales through Same-Day Delivery growing 40x since January 2025, making fresh groceries one of the most-ordered categories on its platform.","Amazon recently announced that it is shutting down its amazon fresh supermarket chain.

Despite a significant selloff in software stocks triggered by Anthropic's legal AI tools, they argue AI will enhance, not replace, existing software, enabling greater productivity and innovation.

Nvidia's Huang chimes in with Pichai, calls selloff 'most illogical thing in the world'

What exactly triggered the selloff

India’s AI Rise Gets Global Push As UN Chief Praises Leadership, Nvidia CEO Predicts Job Surge

Why the fear runs deeper than one plugin

Google CEO Sundar Pichai isn't buying the panic. During the company's earnings call, Pichai pushed back against the market hysteria triggered by Anthropic's new AI plugins, calling it overblown. AI is ""an enabling tool,"" he said, just as it has been for Google 's own products—Search, YouTube and others. Companies ""seizing the moment"" will find the same opportunity ahead, he added.His comments come as software stocks worldwide nurse heavy losses. Anthropic's Claude Cowork plugins, wiped out roughly $285 billion from software, legal tech and financial services stocks in a single session. Analysts dubbed it a 'SaaSpocalypse'. Pichai's view? The scramble is overdone.Pichai isn't alone in questioning the market reaction. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was even more direct at a Cisco event, calling the selloff ""the most illogical thing in the world."" His take: AI will use existing software tools, not reinvent them. ""Would you use a screwdriver or invent a new screwdriver?"" he asked. Huang added that Nvidia itself has adopted such tools extensively, freeing up employees to focus on designing chips and computer systems.Software company executives have also pushed back, arguing they do far more than just build code. Their offerings include data management and purpose-built solutions that are difficult to replicate, especially for enterprises outside the tech world like retail and oil and gas.Anthropic released 11 open-source plugins for Claude Cowork, its agentic AI assistant for non-technical professionals. Most covered standard enterprise functions—sales, marketing, finance, customer support. But the legal plugin rattled nerves. It automates contract review, NDA triage, compliance checks and legal briefings.Morgan Stanley analyst Toni Kaplan called it ""a sign of intensifying competition"" that could hurt big players in the legal space. The fallout was swift. Thomson Reuters and RELX both closed down around 15%. LegalZoom crashed nearly 20%. Indian IT stocks weren't spared—Infosys ADRs slipped 5.5%, Wipro fell nearly 5%.The concern isn't just about legal workflows. There's a dawning realisation that AI tools can now do far more than most non-techies realise. With relatively simple prompts, they can take over a user's computer, write software, analyse stock market data, manage emails and countless other tasks. People have taken to social media describing how they built their first software program without ever learning to code. Shopify's CEO built software that could interpret his recent MRI.Meta's CFO Susan Li told investors last week that the company has seen a 30% year-over-year increase in output per engineer driven by AI coding tools. Power users have seen an 80% boost.Anthropic's numbers back up the concern. Claude Code hit $1 billion in annualised recurring revenue by November, months after launch. The company is reportedly raising $20 billion at a $350 billion valuation. Jefferies noted that OpenAI is losing corporate ground to Claude, with enterprises now making up 80% of Anthropic's business.Pichai and Huang are betting the panic subsides. Wall Street isn't so sure yet.","Google ceo sundar pichai and nvidia ceo jensen huang dismiss market panic over ai plugins, calling it overblown.

Piyush Goyal Says Agriculture Is Self Reliant Sector As India Refuses Farm Import Benefits To US

Steel, energy and technology to drive future imports

India will face no difficulty in purchasing goods worth $500 billion from the United States over the next five years, with Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal calling the number “very conservative” given the scale of demand expected from the country’s expanding economy.Speaking to PTI Videos in an interview on Sunday, Goyal said India’s import demand is projected to touch about $2 trillion over the next five years, creating significant scope to increase sourcing from the US.“We are even today importing 300 billion dollars of goods that can be imported from the US. We are importing from all over the world. That is going to grow up to two trillion in the next five years...I told my counterparts that look, I can assure you that there is demand in India, but you have to be competitive,” he said.India and the US on Saturday announced that they have finalised the framework for the first phase of the bilateral trade agreement. According to a joint statement issued by both sides, India has expressed its intention to purchase $500 billion of US energy products, aircraft and aircraft parts, precious metals, technology products and coking coal over the next five years.Goyal said rising investments by global technology firms in India are expected to significantly increase demand for equipment imports.He said large data centre expansion is likely to drive demand for US-origin technology and equipment.“My sense is that we will see 10 gigawatts of data centres” in India, he said, adding that the US can supply key equipment required for such infrastructure.Responding to a query on whether the $500 billion purchase plan includes existing aircraft orders, including Boeing deals, Goyal said current commitments are part of the overall figure.“Everything that we are talking about is in continuation and includes what we already are purchasing,” he said.He added that India currently imports about $45-50 billion worth of goods from the US, largely in categories where domestic production is limited.“We are going to need aircraft. We are going to need engines for aircraft. We are going to need spare parts. We already have $50 billion worth of orders on Boeing alone for aircraft. We have orders for engines,” he said.The minister said aviation sector demand alone could cross $100 billion over the next five years.“So, almost 80, 90 billion (dollars) is already on order for the next five years. We will actually need more than that. I read the other day that Tata plans to place some more orders. My sense is we need at least a 100 billion dollar plus only for the aviation sector, in addition to oil, LNG, LPG, and crude oil,” he said.Goyal also flagged strong demand for coking coal to support steel sector expansion.India is already importing about 17-18 billion tonnes of coking coal, he said, adding that rising steel production could push import demand sharply higher.“When we reach 300 billion, which is a stated target and expansion is going on at breakneck speed in the steel industry. We'll need 30 billion dollars per year for cooking coal alone. And all of these products I'm mentioning are already being imported since the Congress time, since the UPA was in power. Nothing new,” he said.The minister said rising consumption and industrial demand in the world’s fastest-growing major economy will continue to drive imports of high-end technology and industrial inputs.“There's a growth of demand and consumption of all of these products. In addition, we announced in the budget that we want to promote data centres, we want to promote the AI mission, and we want to promote critical manufacturing and critical minerals processing in India. All of this will require high-quality machinery, ICT products, and Nvidia chips, as well as machinery for AI for quantum computing. Where is all of that going to come from?” he said.Goyal said the US remains the world’s leading provider of advanced technologies.“So, 100 billion (dollars per year) is very conservative. I think it's extremely conservative for a country which wants to become a 30 trillion dollar economy, which India intends to,” he added.","Commerce and industry minister piyush goyal calls number ‘very conservative’ india’s import demand is projected to touch about $2 trillion over the next five years.

Dubai has formally launched the operational phase of fully autonomous RT6 taxi vehicles, marking a major step in the emirate’s push to integrate advanced artificial intelligence into its transport network.The launch was led by Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, and Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai. Sheikh Hamdan travelled in one of the autonomous taxis to the venue of the World Government Summit at Madinat Jumeirah, demonstrating the readiness of the technology to operate in real urban conditions on roads open to live traffic. The milestone clears the path for the public launch of the service in the first quarter of 2026.During the journey, Sheikh Hamdan was briefed on the vehicle’s operating system, which relies on artificial intelligence, advanced sensing technologies, and autonomous decision-making to ensure safe and seamless mobility. The RT6 vehicle, developed by Baidu Apollo Go, represents the sixth generation of autonomous taxi technology and has been designed for large-scale deployment.It is equipped with more than 40 sensors, including high-precision LiDAR, multi-band radars, and advanced cameras, allowing it to perceive its surroundings accurately, respond to changing traffic conditions, and comply fully with transport safety standards and traffic regulations.The system is supported by a sophisticated software ecosystem that integrates real-time data, high-definition maps, and deep learning algorithms, enabling smooth interaction with intersections, pedestrians, and other vehicles. The technology draws on extensive global experience, with Baidu Apollo Go vehicles having completed more than 150 million kilometres of safe driving and over 10 million autonomous trips across several cities.The initiative is the result of cooperation between the Roads and Transport Authority and Baidu Apollo Go, following discussions held during the World Governments Summit 2025. Within around 10 months, the partnership progressed from planning to live operations, reflecting Dubai’s regulatory efficiency and smart infrastructure readiness.As part of the expansion, Baidu Apollo Go has opened its first autonomous vehicle operations and control centre outside China at Dubai Science Park. Spanning 2,000 square metres, the facility manages daily operations, monitoring, software updates, maintenance, and safety testing. The company plans to expand its autonomous fleet in Dubai to more than 1,000 vehicles in the coming years, reinforcing the emirate’s ambition to lead the future of smart and sustainable mobility.","Sheikh hamdan launched driverless rt6 taxi operations in dubai, paving the way for public service in 2026.

COPENHAGEN: The makers of mobile apps designed to help shoppers identify and boycott American goods say they saw a surge of interest in Denmark and beyond after the flare-up in tensions over President Trump's designs on Greenland.The creator of the ""Made O'Meter"" app, Ian Rosenfeldt, said he saw around 30,000 downloads of the free app in just three days at the height of the trans-Atlantic crisis in late Jan out of more than 100,000 since it was launched in March 2025.Rosenfeldt, who works in digital marketing, decided to create the app a year ago after joining a Facebook group of like-minded Danes hoping to boycott US goods. ""Many people were frustrated and thinking, 'How do we actually do this in practical terms,'"" the 53-year-old recalled. ""If you use a bar code scanner, it's difficult to see if a product is actually American or not. And if you don't know that, you can't make a conscious choice. ""The latest version of ""Made O'Meter"" uses artificial intelligence to identify and analyse several products at a time, then recommend similar European-made alternatives. Users can set preferences, like ""No USA-owned brands"" or ""Only EU-based brands."" The app claims over 95% accuracy.""By using AI, you can take an image of a product ... and it can make a deep dive to go out and find the correct information about the product in many levels,"" Rosenfeldt told Associated Press during a demonstration at a Copenhagen grocery store. ""This way, you have information that you can use to take decisions on what you think is right.""After an initial surge of downloads when the app was launched, usage tailed off. Until last month, when Trump stepped up his rhetoric about the need for the US to acquire Greenland, a strategically important and mineral-rich Arctic island that is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark.Usage peaked Jan 23, when there were almost 40,000 scans in one day, compared with 500 or so daily last summer. It has dropped back since but there were still around 5,000 a day this week, said Rosenfeldt, who noted ""Made O'Meter"" is used by over 20,000 people in Denmark but also by people in Germany, Spain, Italy, even Venezuela. ""It's become personal,"" said Rosenfeldt, who spoke of ""losing an ally and a friend."" Rosenfeldt knows such boycotts won't damage the US economy, but hopes to send a message to supermarkets and encourage greater reliance on European producers.Another Danish app, ""NonUSA,"" topped 100,000 downloads at the beginning of Feb. One of its creators, 21-year-old Jonas Pipper, said there were over 25,000 downloads Jan 21, when 526 product scans were performed in a minute at one point. Of the users, some 46,000 are in Denmark and around 10,000 in Germany. ""We noticed some users saying they felt like a little bit of the pressure was lifted off them,"" Pipper said. On a recent morning, shoppers leaving one Copenhagen grocery store were divided. ""We do boycott, but we don't know all the American goods. So, it's mostly the well-known trademarks,"" said Morten Nielsen, 68, a retired navy officer. Sixty-three retiree Charlotte Fuglsang said, ""I love America, I love travelling in America.
