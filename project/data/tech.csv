Kaylee Hartung reveals emotional toll of rising success at Amazon

Kaylee Hartung Is Not Gonna Lie!

Charissa Thompson fades from the NFL spotlight but rebounds in unexpected way

In the high-stakes world of NFL broadcasting , few stories are as layered as that of Kaylee Hartung and Charissa Thompson . Both respected voices on the sidelines, their careers have taken dramatically different turns in recent months—one climbing the ladder, the other navigating a sudden, silent exit.After a successful stint with major networks like CBS, CNN, and ESPN, Hartung joined Amazon Prime Video ’s Thursday Night Football crew in 2022. The move was a major leap forward—but it also came with internal battles. In a raw moment on the Not Gonna Lie podcast with Kylie Kelce, Hartung admitted that her work-focused lifestyle left little room for personal joy.“It’s not a crime if you don’t have hobbies,” she said. “I’ve prioritized my career. Fault me for it if you’d like – I need to call my mom, my grandmother … I don’t play pickleball — I don’t think that makes me a bad person.” Hartung’s vulnerability resonated with listeners, highlighting how even high achievers grapple with feelings of guilt and self-doubt.While Hartung is finding her voice, Thompson’s journey has taken a surprising turn. After her FOX contract quietly expired post-Super Bowl—with no renewal or Emmy nods—the once-prominent host seemed to vanish from the NFL spotlight. This shift followed backlash from a past podcast admission where Thompson revealed, “I’ve sometimes made up sideline reports when coaches gave me nothing.” Though she later apologized, the controversy lingered.Still, Thompson didn’t let the fallout define her. In a bold career pivot, she signed on with Blue Origin to cover the New Shepard Mission NS-31—the first all-female space crew since 1963. “Let’s goooooooo, thrilled to be joining @blueorigin for this historic launch!!!” she announced on Instagram, signaling a powerful comeback.Also Read: From Hollywood sweetheart to controversy magnet: Has Josh Allen's fiance Hailee Steinfeld’s public image taken a hit in 2025? Despite the contrasting paths, both Hartung and Thompson are rewriting the rules of what success looks like. Whether it’s Hartung’s honesty about insecurity or Thompson’s cosmic career switch, these women prove that even in a cutthroat industry, resilience and reinvention still win the day.","After a successful stint with major networks, kaylee hartung joined amazon prime video ’s thursday night football crew in 2022.

Fans spot a hidden connection between Travis Kelce’s podcast memory and Taylor Swift’s lyrics

Best NFL Offseason Advice, Kelce Mock Drafts, and Dumb Questions with a Salary Cap Expert | EP 134

Swifties picked up on a subtle but sweet connection between Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift ’s lyrics in her song “So High School,” and it all started with a casual moment on his podcast. During the April 17 episode of New Heights, Travis was chatting with his brother Jason when he brought up the first R-rated movie he remembered watching as a kid, American Pie .Travis Kelce didn’t mention Taylor Swift or her song at all but Swifties immediately connected the dots. In “So High School,” Taylor sings, “I’m watching American Pie with you on a Saturday night,” and fans believe the song is about Travis. His random mention of the movie felt like an unspoken confirmation.He said, “The one I remember watching that I didn’t even realize was rated R was ‘American Pie,’ and that was when we were, like, 10… I was just f–king going to the movies.” The brothers laughed about how laid-back their parents were when it came to movies.Though Kelce hasn’t officially confirmed the exact story behind it, fans strongly believe it nods to a personal, cozy moment the two shared, likely watching the 1999 teen movie American Pie together. The song is filled with high school-style imagery, like playing ""Truth or Dare"" and hanging out while video games play in the background, suggesting she’s painting a picture of innocent, nostalgic love, something that reminds her of being young and carefree with him.He mentioned, “I forget how I got in. I might have been there with someone else’s parents.” The song, from The Tortured Poets Department: The Anthology, includes more nods to Kelce, like “You know how to ball, I know Aristotle,” and “marry, kiss or kill me” a clear reference to Kelce’s 2016 game where he said he’d kiss Swift. Kelce later told People that “So High School” is his favorite song from the album, adding, “I’m a little biased.”Interestingly, actress Alyson Hannigan, who played Michelle in American Pie, was thrilled by the reference. She said she had a full-on “freakout” when she heard it and even woke up her family to share her excitement, feeling like she was witnessing a cute date between Taylor and Travis.Also Read:Their relationship, filled with playful moments and personal references, continues to inspire Swift’s lyrics turning real-life memories into music that fans love decoding. As Travis put it best, he's “a little biased,” and Swifties are all in for it.","Travis kelce explains the origin of the ‘american pie’ reference in taylor swift’s ‘ttpd’ song.

MUMBAI: The actions of two promoters of once high-flying Gensol Engineering is a case study in complete disregard for laid down corporate governance norms. Their deeds included illegal fund diversion for personal enrichment, stock price manipulation, forgery of 'no default' letters from lenders like IREDA and PFC to falsely project there was no default by the company, and misleading Sebi The two promoters of now disgraced company, Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi , used hundreds of crores rupees of the entity as they wished, a Sebi investigation showed. The interim investigation revealed that the two had systematically used loans from several creditors, taken in the name of Gensol, to buy a luxury flat in The Camellias in Gurugram and to jack up Gensol's stock price. Not only this, the loans were used for personal benefit through their private ventures and for purposes other than for which they were taken.Sebi's investigation revealed that the two brothers, among other expenses for personal use from diverted funds, spent Rs 26 lakh to buy golf sets, spent nearly Rs 23 lakh to pay credit card dues, around Rs 8 lakh for interior decoration. In one of the several instances of fund diversions, Gensol transferred Rs 775 crore to Go-Auto , an auto dealership through which it bought electric vehicles for BluSmart, a ride hailing company.Of this, about Rs 570 crore was used to buy EVs for BluSmart. Of the balance Rs 205 crore, Rs 43 crore was diverted to buy the luxury flat in Gurugram, developed by real estate major DLF. Initially booked in the name of the mother of the two promoters, the transaction was later reversed in the name of Capbridge Ventures, a partnership of the two Jaggi brothers.Also read: Commuters in Bengaluru, NCR get the blues as e-cab firm BluSmart pulls plug On Tuesday, Sebi barred the two promoters from the securities markets until further notice.

The historic flight, departing around 9:30 a.m. ET, marks a milestone for Jeff Bezos ’ company, with the crew wearing custom-designed astronaut suits by Monse.The suits, crafted from flame-resistant stretch neoprene, were tailored to each woman’s body using 3-D scans for a precise fit. Sanchez, 55, collaborated with Monse co-founders Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim starting in late 2024 to design suits that balance function with style. “Usually, these suits are made for a man,” Sánchez told The New York Times, explaining that previous suits were merely tailored for women. The new designs include features like calf zippers for flared legs, aiming to be both flattering and functional.Sánchez described the suits as “elegant” with “a little spice,” while Garcia cited motocross outfits and ski suits as inspirations, emphasizing simplicity with a “dangerous” edge. “I almost put a corset in your suit,” Garcia teased Sánchez, who said she would have embraced it.

B ENGALURU: Infosys forecast one of its weakest revenue guidance ranges, between 0% and 3% for 2025-26, mainly due to macroeconomic uncertainties and tariff-related concerns. According to the company, in response to tepid market cues, customers have become more cautious with their discretionary spending, prompting discussions about cost efficiency and vendor consolidation deals. However, it retained its margin guidance of 20-22% for the current financial year.This forecast stands as one of the lowest revenue guidance in more than a decade, excluding the pandemic when the company suspended its guidance due to broader economic instability. At the beginning of 2024-25, it projected revenue of 1-3%. The company's worst growth in the past 16 years was during the global financial crisis in 2009-10 when growth fell to 3%.The bleak forecast led to its American Depositary Receipts (ADRs) shedding about 3% in early trade on NYSE. Infosys's revenue rose 4.2% in 2024-25, falling short of its projected growth target range of 4.5-5%. Its revenue for the March quarter grew 4.8% year-on-year, but it declined 3.5% sequentially.For 2024-25, its larger peer TCS's revenue grew by 4.2% in constant currency and Wipro's declined 2.3% during the same period. Infosys's margins inched up 0.5% to 21.1% in the last financial year, but it dropped 0.3% sequentially.""The environment is uncertain, and we will execute our plans with agility by keeping a close watch on the changes,"" said Infosys CEO Salil Parekh in the earnings press conference. ""We are seeing the deals that we did in the recent quarters are continuing to ramp up. Because of the changes in the economic outlook, there will be some discussions focused on more consolidation and cost pressures with clients. But at this stage, we've not seen a change in that. However, the guidance has factored in what we anticipate in different scenarios because all of this is happening in the last few days,"" he said. Infosys signed deals worth $11.6 billion in the last fiscal, a 34% decline compared to the 2023-24.Regarding salary increases for the ongoing financial year, CFO Jayesh Sanghrajka refrained from providing fresh details. However, he maintained his position that the IT firm was proceeding as planned with the increments implemented in Jan and April for the last financial year. Its attrition inched up to 14.1% in the March quarter compared to 13.7% in the Dec quarter.","The bleak forecast led to its american depositary receipts (adrs) shedding about 3% in early trade on nyse.

These ports were the primary entry points for yarn imports from India.A notification in this regard was issued Sunday with immediate effect.Earlier, India had withdrawn transshipment facility for Bangladesh. ""The transshipment facility extended to Bangladesh had over a period of time resulted in significant congestion at our airports and ports,"" ministry of external affairs spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said recently, adding that logistical delays and higher costs were hindering their own exports and creating backlogs.","Import of yarn through the benapole, bhomra, sonamasjid, banglabandha and burimari land ports will no longer be permitted.

Struggling Ivory Coast cocoa farmers worried about US tariff plans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/struggling-ivory-coast-cocoa-farmers-worried-about-us-tariff-plans/articleshow/120369230.cms,"A cocoa farmer working (AP)

N'GATTAKRO: Jean Mari Konan Yao says he's struggling as a cocoa farmer in the west African nation of Ivory Coast, which produces almost half the world's cocoa supply of the raw ingredient used in chocolate. Like many in Ivory Coast - the world's biggest cocoa producer - Konan Yao says cocoa has long provided a lifeline for him, but adverse weather and plant diseases have hurt harvests in recent years.Now, cocoa farmers worry even more over President Donald Trump's plans to impose a 21 per cent tariff on products from Ivory Coast - the highest among West African nations.Although Trump has suspended the tariff plans for 90 days pending further review, authorities in Ivory Coast have warned that such tariffs could send the price of cocoa even higher and destabilise the local market by slowing their sales.Ivory Coast produces between 2 million and 2.5 million metric tonnes of cocoa annually, with around 200,000 to 300,000 metric tonnes exported to the United States, according to the Coffee and Cocoa Council.In 2023, Ivory Coast exported USD 3.68 billion worth of cocoa beans, its second biggest export after gold. The US was its fourth-largest importer of cocoa beans, after the Netherlands, Malaysia and Belgium, according to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.For most local cocoa growers, any US tariff could further shake a market already struggling with decreasing yields and shrinking funding that has limited farmers' ability to meet global demands for chocolate.""If we hear the American president is going to put a tax on the price of cocoa, it's really not good for us, it doesn't help us,"" said another cocoa farmer, Salif Traore.Already, cocoa prices were rising in the country, in part because of insufficient and irregular rainfall in Ivory Coast.The UK-based Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit research firm has noted a 32 per cent rise in the price of cocoa imported into the United Kingdom over the last three years, partially due to extreme weather conditions in parts of Africa where it's mainly grown. Together, Ivory Coast, Ghana, Nigeria and Cameroon produce about three-quarters of the world's cocoa.Cocoa is traded on a regulated, global market. In Ivory Coast, the government usually sets cocoa prices at the onset of each season, with prices reflecting market trends and global prices. The local prices are, however, lower than the global market rates, thereby limiting the farmers' profit from high global prices.Authorities say they are already considering cocoa price increases if the US tariff comes into effect.""Donald Trump's customs tax is causing us problems. We are already feeling the effects,"" said Boss Diarra, coordinator of the local cocoa farmers' union in Bouafle in central Ivory Coast. He pointed to bags of cocoa that he said farmers have been unable to sell.Meanwhile, a US tariff could mean more cocoa for European markets, said Bruno Marcel Iritie, researcher at the Ivorian Felix Houphouet-Boigny Polytechnic Institute. Some of the top importers of Ivory Coast cocoa are in Europe, market data show.European customers ""will inevitably buy cheaper because when there is too much, the customer is king,"" Iritie said.",Ivory coast produces almost half the world's cocoa supply of the raw ingredient used in chocolate. President donald trump has suspended the tariff plans for 90 days pending further review. Authorities in ivory coast have warned that such tariffs could send the price of cocoa even higher and destabilise the local market.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120369923,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1669662,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Visas to job risks: US woes hit education loan cos,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/visas-to-job-risks-us-woes-hit-education-loan-cos/articleshow/120397922.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: India's education loan companies are facing collateral damage from the Trump administration's crackdown on immigrants. With the US accounting for 50-75% of the education loan disbursements, lenders are facing a business slowdown as students rethink their America plans.Lenders are also implementing stringent assessment checks to process US education loans , preferring strong profiles and top-tier universities amid mounting concerns over borrowers' ability to repay loans given the political situation and risk of a hiring slowdown in the US due to tariff-led recession fears. This, in a way, is shrinking their pool of US candidates, impacting business. Apart from banks, a growing crop of NBFCs, new-age financial and study abroad platforms, including players like Credila, Avanse Financial Services, and InCred Finance, operate in the higher education lending space in India.For some firms like InCred Finance, enquiries and applications for US loans have halved compared to last year. ""The US business (industry-wide) is down by half already and will decline even more if the Trump administration's anti-immigration and America First approach get strengthened further. If the OPT (optional practical training) and STEM OPT programmes are stopped, the demand for US courses will, in all likelihood, significantly dwindle,"" Nilanjan Chattoraj, director, education loans at InCred Finance, told TOI.While the demand to study in other countries like the UK, Australia, and Canada will provide some cushion to firms, they are, in the interim (for existing US loans), preparing to resort to regulatory models that allow them the flexibility to restructure loans and recover payments, given the threat of many students having to come back without completing studies and getting jobs, said industry executives. ""RBI does allow certain flexibility in restructuring such accounts. We have the regulatory models in place. As of now, only 1-2% of students required it, but that is expected to now jump to 5%. It is going to be tricky,"" said Chattoraj.Loans for the US are still being granted, but approval rates have tightened for US-bound applicants, said Akshay Chaturvedi, founder and CEO at Leverage, which partners with banks and NBFCs to provide education loans. ""Lenders are factoring in perceived immigration risks and ROI (return on investment) uncertainty. We are also seeing a spike in queries about transfer options (credits transfer to a different university in a different destination) and backup plans,"" Chaturvedi said, adding that interest in studying in the US has not collapsed, but students are being more cautious.A report by Associated Press said that, in the US, at least 901 students (overall from across countries) at 128 colleges and universities had their visas revoked or legal status terminated since mid-March. International student enrolments in the US fell by 11% between March 2024 and 2025, with Indian enrolments dropping by 28% during the period, said Sonal Kapoor, global chief business officer at London-based Prodigy Finance, citing data from market intelligence firm ICEF Monitor. Countries like the UK are emerging as alternatives for Indian students.","The us accounts for 50-75% of the education loan disbursements in india.

Wallet refunds will take up to 90 days: BluSmart,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/wallet-refunds-will-take-up-to-90-days-blusmart/articleshow/120398100.cms,"Wallet refunds will take up to 90 days: BluSmart

BENGALURU: Electric cab aggregator BluSmart has pushed the timeline for refunding wallet balances to users to 90 days, up from six days earlier this week, amid a pause in ride bookings across cities where it operates.Several users have taken to social media to express concerns over the lack of clarity over the refund.As of Thursday, bookings remained unavailable on the BluSmart app in Delhi-NCR . Customers with balances in their BluSmart wallets have been advised to wait for up to three months for refunds if services do not resume. In an email sent to customers, the company said, “We’ve decided to temporarily close bookings on the BluSmart app. We truly appreciate your support. While we strive to be back soon to serve you with same warmth and smile, we will initiate a refund within next 90 days if services do not resume before then. ”BluSmart, which operates primarily in Delhi-NCR and Bengaluru, allows users to top up their app wallets to pay for electric cab rides.The development comes against the backdrop of an ongoing probe by the Sebi into Gensol Engineering , a company linked to BluSmart’s promoters Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi.Sebi has barred the Jaggi brothers from board roles and securities market access, alleging they diverted loans, intended for vehicle financing, to unrelated real estate deals.Legal experts TOI spoke to said the absence of a regulatory oversight over closed-loop wallets such as BluSmart’s raises serious legal implications that directly affect customer rights, refund accountability and recourse mechanisms. “Closed loop wallets are exempt under the RBI’s Master Directions on Prepaid Payment Instruments, which means they are neither licensed nor supervised by the central bank.The legal vacuum that follows renders the consumer’s ability to reclaim funds precarious, with no statutory mandate on fund segregation, refund timelines, or dispute resolution,” Sonam Chandwani, managing partner, KS Legal & Associates, said. BluSmart did not respond to TOI’s request for comment.","Blusmart has pushed the timeline for refunding wallet balances to users to 90 days, up from six days earlier this week.
