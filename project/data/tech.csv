Right to Disconnect Bill 2025: Supriya Sule moves legislation to promote work-life balance for employees after office hours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supriya-sule-moves-bill-to-ensure-right-to-disconnect-after-office-hours/articleshow/125803345.cms,"Supriya Sule (ANI image)

NEW DELHI: Lok Sabha member Supriya Sule has introduced a private member's Bill in the Lower House to promote work-life balance for workers and employees in India.The Bill, ""The Right to Disconnect Bill, 2025"", seeks to impose sanctions at a rate of 1 per cent of the total remuneration of its employees on entities (companies or societies) for any non-compliance with the provisions of the Bill.The Bill, as introduced in the Lok Sabha on Friday, provides every employee the right to disconnect from work-related electronic communications.""It aims to foster a better quality of life and a healthier work-life balance by reducing the ""burnout caused by today's digital culture,"" she wrote on X.While digital and communication technology offer benefits in terms of work flexibility, it also carries a significant risk of eroding the boundaries between professional and personal life, she argued in the private member's Bill.""Studies have found that if an employee is expected to be available round the clock, they tend to exhibit risks of over-work like sleep deprivation, developing stress and being emotionally exhausted. This persistent urge to respond to calls and emails (termed as 'telepressure'), constant checking of emails throughout the day, and even on weekends and holidays, is reported to have destroyed the work-life balance of employees,"" the statement of objects and reasons of the Bill read.""According to a study, the constant monitoring of work related messages and emails, may overtax employees' brains leading to a condition called 'info-obesity'.""The Bill argued that there is a need to respect the personal space of the employees by recognising their right to disconnect and not respond to their employer's calls, emails etc., during out-of-work hours.""The need is also to recognise the rights of the employees, it also takes into consideration the competitive needs of the companies and their diverse work cultures. Flexibility in the right to disconnect rules and leaves it to the individual companies to negotiate terms of service with their employees is need of the hour,"" the Bill further read.The digital transformation has direct impact on conditions in the employment contract, like the time and the place of work.Hence if an employee agrees to works during out-of-work hours, overtime pay at the same rate as his wage rate is also necessary to check the surge in unpaid overtime work, brought about by digital transformation, she argued in the Bill.The Bill also provides for counselling services to increase awareness among employees and citizens, on reasonable use of digital and communication tools, for professional and personal use.To free an employee from digital distractions and enable him to truly connect with the people around him, the Bill provides for digital detox centres.""The Bill thus champions for the rights and welfare of employees, by mandating individual entities to negotiate out-of-hour service conditions with their employees, and upholding the right of employee to disconnect. The Bill seeks to recognise right to disconnect as a way to reduce stress and ease tension between an employees' personal and professional life,"" the Bill concluded.She introduced all together what she termed forward-looking Private Member Bills in the Parliament - the other two were The Paternity and Paternal Benefits Bill, 2025. It introduces paid paternal leave to ensure fathers have the legal right to take part in their child's early development. It breaks the traditional model, supports the new mother's well-being, and promotes flexible parenting.The other one is the Code on Social Security (Amendment) Bill, 2025, that recognises platform-based gig workers as a distinct category, ensuring minimum wages, regulated hours, social security, fair conditions, and equitable contracts to ensure a fairer, more sustainable environment and economy for them.Several other members of the Lok Sabha also introduced their Private Member Bills in the House.","Lok sabha member supriya sule has introduced a private member's bill to promote work-life balance for workers and employees in india.

Paramount vs Netflix: What’s at stake in Hollywood

Market reaction

NEW DELHI: Paramount has launched a $108 billion hostile bid to acquire Warner Bros Discovery (WBD), directly appealing to shareholders just days after WBD agreed to be acquired by Netflix. The move sets up a rare, high-stakes media battle that could reshape global entertainment.The offer, announced late Monday, comes from Paramount and its CEO David Ellison , who told CNBC the bid aims “to finish what we started.” The all-cash offer of $30 per share is pitched as a more secure alternative to Netflix’s $27.75-per-share proposal made last week.Paramount argues its bid “provides shareholders $18 billion more in cash than the Netflix consideration” and offers “a quicker path to completion,” according to an official statement.Netflix agreed on Friday to buy WBD’s studios and HBO Max after the entertainment giant splits into two companies. Paramount accused Warner of failing to “meaningfully engage” despite submitting six takeover proposals in 12 weeks. The company signalled it is prepared for a prolonged tender battle, despite having a much smaller market value of around $14 billion, compared to Netflix’s $400+ billion.Also read: Warner Bros-Netflix deal - Is the Tudum effect harmful for Indian cinema? 'The risk is two-fold' The Paramount bid is backed by the Ellison family, RedBird Capital, and $54 billion in debt commitments from Bank of America, Citi and Apollo.Paramount warned WBD shareholders that Netflix’s takeover is unlikely to clear global regulators. Netflix, however, has included a $5.8 billion breakup fee in its terms, signalling confidence. Co-CEO Ted Sarandos said he is “highly confident” the deal will be approved.US President Donald Trump weighed in, telling reporters the Netflix deal “could be a problem” due to market dominance and adding, “I’ll be involved in that decision.”If Warner backs out of the Netflix deal to accept another offer, it must pay $2.8 billion to Netflix.Whoever wins will control some of the most valuable franchises in entertainment, including HBO, Harry Potter, DC Comics, and CNN. If Netflix succeeds, analysts say it will cement the company’s control over Hollywood content and accelerate disruptions to theatres and artificial intelligence-driven filmmaking.If Paramount prevails, Warner would become part of a media empire led by Ellison and Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, who are also positioned to take control of TikTok’s U.S. operations under a deal championed by Trump.Warner shares closed at $26.08, below Netflix’s offer price, signalling investor doubt the deal will close. Paramount shares fell nearly 10%, an unusual move as shareholders typically celebrate avoiding massive acquisition costs.The bidding war could escalate, say analysts, noting similar competitive takeovers have occurred only when exceptionally coveted assets hit the market.","Paramount has launched a $108 billion hostile bid to acquire warner bros discovery.

Where Metaverse budget cuts may go

Meta reportedly delays MR glasses

The day Facebook changed its name to Meta





Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg seems to have finally realised that one of the company's biggest bets—Metaverse—is not working (or not working as expected). It is also the technology that the company changed its very name after. In 2021, after 17 years of being called Facebook, the social networking parent company behind Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus changed its name to Meta. Now according to a report from Bloomberg, Meta is likely to slash its Reality Labs budget, shaving off as much as 30%. The proposed metaverse cuts are reportedly part of the company's annual budget planning for 2026, which included a series of meetings at Zuckerberg's compound in Hawaii last month.For those unaware, Metaverse unit works on virtual reality headsets and a VR-based social network, which produces the company's Quest mixed-reality headsets, smart glasses made with EssilorLuxottica's Ray-Ban and upcoming augmented-reality glasses. Meta has struggled to sell its vision of an immersive metaverse of interconnected virtual worlds and expand the market for its devices beyond the niche of the gaming community.Analysts see the move reflecting the overall lack of interest in products like Meta’s social virtual reality platform Horizon Worlds, as well as its virtual reality hardware—both in the industry at large, as well as among consumers.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s Metaverse vision has posted more than $70 billion in losses over the past four years. Little doubt then that Facebook parent's shares rose 4% as the move eased some investor jitters over a bet that CEO Mark Zuckerberg has backed with billions of dollars. ""Smart move, just late,"" told Huber Research Partners analyst Craig Huber to Bloomberg. He added, ""This seems a major shift to align costs with a revenue outlook that surely is not as prosperous as management thought years ago. ""So, what may really be troubling Metaverse? No one can really pinpoint. But as a report in Fortune says, for many people, the problem is that the value proposition is unclear; Metaverse simply doesn’t yet deliver a must-have reason to ditch their smartphones or laptops.Reality Labs is made up of a Metaverse unit and a wearables unit. Within the Metaverse unit, executives are reportedly considering making cuts to VR jobs. As the report says, cuts in resources that high are most likely to include layoffs as early as January.The report comes as Meta scrambles to stay relevant in Silicon Valley's artificial-intelligence race after its Llama 4 model met with a poor reception. To fuel its ambitious goals, Meta has committed as much as $72 billion in capital spending this year. The company reorganized its AI efforts under Superintelligence Labs earlier this year, with Zuckerberg said to be personally leading an aggressive talent acquisition, floating offers for startups and directly courting prospects on WhatsApp with million-dollar pay packages. In fact, Meta's big hiring is said to have triggered a talent war in the Silicon Valley.Last month, Meta Platforms said that it will invest $600 billion in the US infrastructure and jobs over the next three years, including artificial intelligence data centers. Meta has doubled down on AI, with a target of achieving superintelligence. Zuckerberg said Meta is building compute because ""it's the right strategy to aggressively front-load capacity so we're prepared for the most optimistic cases,"" on the company's recent earnings call. Meta has forecast ""notably larger"" capital expenses next year thanks to investments in artificial intelligence, including aggressively building data centers to power its AI push.Incidentally, earlier this week, Zuckerberg announced that Alan Dye, a longtime designer at Apple, is joining Meta to lead a new creative studio inside the Reality Labs division that would focus on design, fashion and technology. Dye will report to Andrew Bosworth, Meta’s chief technology officer, who leads Reality Labs. “We’re entering a new era where A.I. glasses and other devices will change how we connect with technology and each other,” Mr. Zuckerberg said in a post to Threads. “With this new studio, we’re focused on making every interaction thoughtful, intuitive, and built to serve people.”Meta has reportedly delayed the launch of its Mixed Reality Glasses (MR Glasses) from the second half of 2026 to the first half of 2027. According to a report in Business Insider, Meta executives announced the delay after meetings with CEO Mark Zuckerberg is said to have told the team to take more time to make the business sustainable and deliver higher quality experiences.In October 2021, after 17 years of being called Facebook, the social networking giant behind Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus got a new name. Facebook’s corporate entity became Meta. Mark Zuckerberg announced the change at the company’s AR/VR-focused Connect event, sharing that the new title captured more of the company’s core ambition: to build the metaverse.",$70 billion in losses and counting.layoffs may be coming to meta.

Elon Musk's Starlink has revealed the residential satellite internet pricing for India at Rs 8,600 monthly, plus a Rs 34,000 hardware kit, as the SpaceX subsidiary prepares for commercial operations. The service targets households in remote and underserved areas with promises of unlimited data, 99.9% uptime, and weather-resistant connectivity where traditional broadband infrastructure fails to reach.Following regulatory clearance from the Department of Telecommunications in July, Starlink is positioning itself to challenge established players Jio-SES and Eutelsat OneWeb in India's satellite communications sector.The residential plan, priced at a monthly subscription cost of Rs 8,600 offers unlimited data without usage caps or throttling, addressing critical connectivity gaps in rural regions. Starlink's system requires minimal installation effort, with users simply powering on equipment and pointing it skyward to establish connections. However, the hardware kit will cost customers Rs 34,000, which the company says is a one time fees.The company guarantees over 99.9% uptime and all-weather functionality, crucial features for areas experiencing frequent service disruptions.New customers receive a 30-day trial period, allowing households to evaluate performance before long-term commitment. This trial provision acknowledges the premium pricing structure, which places Starlink among India's higher-cost broadband options despite targeting underserved markets.Business subscription pricing remains unannounced, with enterprise-focused plans expected as commercial rollout advances.Starlink is deploying gateway earth stations across Chandigarh, Hyderabad, Kolkata, Lucknow, Mumbai, and Noida to enable satellite-to-ground communications. These relay installations are essential for maintaining low-latency connections and service reliability across India's varied geography.The company posted four specialist positions at its Bengaluru office in October, recruiting talent in payments, accounting, treasury, and tax operations as part of infrastructure expansion.

Slow EV adoption weighs on profits







Europe's auto industry is braced for a major announcement from the EU on December 10, which could see significant changes made to the European Commission's proposed 2035 combustion engine phase-out.However, amid pressure from carmakers and other affected sectors such as car rental and car leasing companies, the announcement may now be pushed back until January.""We are still working on it,"" EU Commissioner for Sustainable Transport and Tourism Apostolos Tzitzikostas told the German business newspaper Handelsblatt this week. ""We want to present an automotive package that is truly comprehensive and covers all the necessary aspects.""Multiple media reports in recent weeks have suggested the EU Commission plans to force the electrification of rental, leasing and company-car markets by 2030, while significantly relaxing the wider 2035 ban on all internal combustion engines and allowing alternatives to electric vehicles (EVs).An executive with a major car rental company told DW that, based on their discussions with the EU, they expect the EU to propose strict electric vehicle quotas for what are known as fleet operators.They said the discussions suggested that car rental, car leasing and company-car operators could face a quota of up to 90% or higher by 2030.""The Commission is not looking for dialogue or discussion, that's our impression,"" the executive said.The EU Commission said it had no comment to add regarding the negotiations. A spokesperson told DW that preparations for the upcoming package were ""ongoing.""Back in 2022, the EU's 27 member states reached a deal to effectively ban sales of new combustion engine cars by agreeing to stop new registrations of vehicles that emit CO2 by 2035. The aim was to bring down the car sector's high emissions, as part of the bloc's strategy to become climate-neutral by 2050.However, Europe's car sector has been beleaguered by a range of problems in recent years, struggling with the technological challenge of the shift to electrification and with drastically ramped-up competition from China.German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has been among those urging to EU to soften the 2035 cut-off date. He has asked Brussels for exemptions for various technologies including plug-in hybrids, battery hybrids and some range-extended electric systems which use a petrol-powered generator to charge the battery.""It is much more opportune and pragmatic to invest more effort and money in the development of efficient, hybrid systems that will combine the best of the world of internal combustion engines on the one hand and electric mobility on the other,"" Merz said.Europe's major carmakers support the German government's move.""The EU Commission is ignoring market realities and risking employment and competitiveness in one of its key industries,"" premium carmaker BMW said in a statement provided to DW. ""It is crucial that the CO2 regulations are redesigned promptly.""The company expects the EU Commission to seriously consider the German proposal before making its announcement. ""We are convinced that all drive systems can and must contribute,"" the statement said. ""Effective climate protection requires ambitious yet realistic guidelines, not targets that are detached from the market.""German brands such as BMW are particularly dominant when it comes to plug-in hybrids. Along with Mercedes, Volkswagen and Audi, they accounted for more than 41% of all plug-in hybrid sales in the EU in the first ten months of the year. A relaxing of the 2035 ban in favor of plug-in hybrids would significantly benefit them.Yet, carmakers remain worried that any softening of the 2035 ban will be offset by the possible quotas on commercial fleets, which comprise around 60% of all new car registrations in Europe. Car rental firms are especially worried.Sixt, one of the largest European car rental companies, has been vocal about its opposition to the reported EU plans.It says a chronic lack of charging infrastructure for electric vehicles across Europe undermines any push towards electrification.""The regulation under discussion would affect more than 60% of all new registrations in Europe and would effectively bring forward the combustion engine ban by around eight years,"" a company spokesperson told DW.Sixt argues ""premature quotas"" would deepen Europe's existing dependency on China for batteries and mineral production vital to the automotive sector.""A transformation that increases dependency and reduces employment is heading in the wrong direction,"" the spokesperson said. ""Any regulatory framework must be aligned with real-world conditions — charging infrastructure, grid capacity, vehicle availability and customer demand.""Andrew Mountstephens, general counsel for Sixt, told DW that the company remains committed to emissions-free mobility. However, customer preference still tended strongly towards diesel and petrol cars.""We just had to realize that many customers were not yet prepared to go the same pace as we wanted to go,"" he said, adding that the lack of charging infrastructure across Europe was a central reason for this.Several car rental and car sharing companies have invested in electric models, only to see heavy losses due to lack of customer interest.Hertz reported a massive $2.9 billion (€2.49 billion) loss in 2024 largely due to a failed investment in tens of thousands of Tesla cars, which were expensive to maintain and which customers largely shunned.The problems with charging infrastructure and customer demand are widespread and have capped previously high expectations over how quickly Europeans would take to electric driving.While new registrations of electic vehicles in the EU rose dramatically from 2017 to 2023,there was a decline in 2024 and only 17% of cars registered in 2025 are expected to be fully electric.Patrick Schaufuss, the head of the Center for Future Mobility at consulting firm McKinsey, says he would expect the EU Commission to ""take those realities into account"" in whatever update it'll come up with.""The speed of the transition is maybe not as fast as we have wished for or had planned,"" he told DW, adding it's vital that any policy platform considers both decarbonization and economic success as ""part of a holistic approach.""Underscoring that long-term electrification will be the future, Schaufuss however noted that markets were ""decoupling"" and different regions move at different speeds. ""So this transition period is crucial, and maintaining economic success throughout this period is absolutely crucial.""",Eu expected to announce major changes to 2035 combustion engine ban on december 10.

A pleasant and peaceful performance at Hangzhou Safari Park in East China’s Zhejiang Province on Saturday turned terrifying when a black bear suddenly attacked its keeper.Several videos are going viral on social media, showing audience members watching as two keepers guided two black bears onto the stage for another round of performance. One bear successfully performed, while the other, nearing the stage, pounced on its keeper and knocked him to the ground, Global News reported.The fallen keeper struggled to escape while nearby staff grabbed chairs and poles to separate the animal. After the bear was pulled away, it lunged at the keeper again, and staff had to use force to separate them.This footage prompted an online debate over whether animal performances should be banned. Other staff immediately intervened and used props to separate the bear from the keeper. Multiple social media users posted videos of the incident recorded during the bears’ show.The park explained that the incident occurred as the keeper was carrying a large bag of carrots and apples; the bear saw the bag, became excited, and pounced on the keeper in an attempt to get the food, according to the notice. The notice also stated that the keeper said the incident reminded him to be more careful in dealings with the bear in the future.The official social media account of Hangzhou Safari Park posted a notice on Saturday stating that neither the keeper nor the bear was injured.One user, Momo, on the China's social media platform commented, “Safety must be a priority, and we should have respect for animals. Never think of them as cute and docile, or that we can control them.”Another user, Zero Geqian Qianqian, also emphasised the need to focus on safety. Many others have called for the cancellation of animal performances. A user named “Don’t Call Me Ma Ma Ma” asked, “When will animal performances be canceled? Isn’t it in animals’ nature to be food-driven and protective of their food?”Some users expressed sympathy for the bear. A user named “The Girl is Out, I’m at Home” said, “A small bear is like a little baby. How could we make it perform? If it has apples, let it eat! If it were your child, would you make it perform first and then eat? If it’s hungry, then let it perform how to eat, it would be happier, the keeper and the bear would be more harmonious, and the audience would still enjoy it.”On the X also, several users commented on the video. One of the user said, ""I see why the Russians train with them 🤣🤣🤣 that bear is a professional grappler.""Another said, ""Maybe if we didn't lock these animals up for our own amusement they wouldn't attack people.""After the video of the bear attack went viral online and sparked debate, the park released a follow-up video showing that the bear and the keeper have since “reconciled.” While feeding the black bear carrots, the keeper gently petted its head and said, “If you want carrots, why did you snatch mine? [Even if you didn’t], I’ll still give you some.” The black bear stood calmly and ate peacefully, displaying a gentle demeanour.",A black bear suddenly attacked its keeper at hangzhou safari park in china.

‘Leapfrog’ advantage





Abu Dhabi’s BRIDGE Summit opened today (Dec 8, 2025), bringing together creators, platforms, investors and stars to map how AI, creators and global storytelling will reshape media. The three-day event mixes headliner keynotes, hands-on sessions and dealmaking, and the tone is unapologetically ambitious.The Bridge Summit 2025 officially kicked off today at the Abu Dhabi National Exhibition Centre (ADNEC), immediately setting a bold tone for the future of global media. Running for three days, the event has attracted a massive convergence of over 60,000 creatives, media specialists, artists, investors, and entrepreneurs.The scale is truly global, with more than 400 speakers, including policymakers and innovation leaders, and attendees from 182 countries.Organizers emphasized that the summit is designed to be the global industry’s new home, a dedicated space for forging high-value partnerships, developing production ecosystems, and exchanging expertise. As stated in the evocative opening film, the message is clear: ""Abu Dhabi is not looking toward the future; it is building it.""A major highlight was the panel featuring Hollywood superstar Idris Elba, who stated he views his own identity as a ""bridge"" between his heritage, the stories he tells, and global audiences. His core mission is to empower African creators and rewrite the continent's global narrative, which has long suffered from misrepresentation.Elba identified a critical issue: many African creators who achieve viral success are blocked from receiving earnings by banking restrictions and digital barriers. To solve this practical problem, he created Akunna (named after his middle name), a platform centered around the Akunna Wallet designed to ensure creators can actually be paid for their work.The opening sessions underscored the sheer economic power of the sector, noting that global media and entertainment generated over $2.8 trillion last year. The line between traditional creative fields is rapidly blurring; today, musicians are becoming developers, and filmmakers are building immersive digital worlds. Key discussions centered on technology, revealing that nearly 70% of content creators are already utilizing AI tools in their work.Speakers explored AI's promise for efficiency and scaling creativity, but also highlighted the associated risks to integrity, authorship, and truth. The consensus was that while AI is a powerful tool, the priority must be establishing frameworks to guide its ethical use and rebuild trust in an age of deepfakes and misinformation.Elba stressed that Africa has a unique advantage: the ability to ""leapfrog"" old infrastructure and build entirely new creative systems, citing the global success of Afrobeats as powerful proof. He argued that the potential for African gaming and fantasy is immense because it operates on a ""blank canvas.""However, he sharply criticized the lack of governmental support, pointing out that some African nations still do not have a dedicated film policy. His message to policymakers was direct: if you want a healthy creative ecosystem, you need infrastructure, distribution, and protection, not just conversation.He concluded that while AI is not the enemy, ""actual intelligence is more powerful than artificial intelligence,"" and requires strong frameworks to maintain authentic human creativity.Beyond panels, BRIDGE is a marketplace: organisers expect the summit to catalyse MoUs, studio deals and investment into production hubs and creative platforms. Abu Dhabi’s push to host the event signals a strategic shift, the emirate wants to be a media-tech crossroads that connects capital, talent and festivals.","Bridge summit 2025 kicks off in abu dhabi, declaring a new era for global media.

Detailed penalties for non-compliance





Delay in system implementation:

Dh5,000 fine per month, or part of a month, for failing to implement the e-invoicing system or appoint an accredited service provider within the required timeline. Non issuance of invoices and credit notes:

Dh100 penalty for each electronic invoice not issued and transmitted on time, capped at Dh5,000 per month.

Dh100 penalty for each electronic credit note not issued and transmitted on time, also capped at Dh5,000 per month. Failure to notify system failures:

Dh1,000 fine per day, or part thereof, for issuers or recipients who do not notify the FTA of system failures within the required timeline. Failure to update accredited service providers:

Dh1,000 fine per day, or part of a day, for issuers or recipients who fail to inform the appointed service provider of changes to data registered with the FTA.

Operational implications for businesses









The UAE is setting a clear deadline for businesses to adopt electronic invoicing, with substantial penalties for delays or non-compliance. From July 2026, every invoice, credit note, and system notification will carry financial consequences, underscoring the government’s drive for accuracy, transparency, and operational discipline in tax reporting.The UAE introduced electronic invoicing regulations in the second quarter of 2025, aiming to modernize tax processes and improve efficiency. Under the system, invoices are generated, exchanged, and reported electronically to the Federal Tax Authority (FTA) in a structured, machine readable format such as XML. This replaces traditional paper or PDF invoices and ensures greater accuracy, transparency, and speed in VAT and other tax-related processes.The rollout is scheduled in phases, with the first phase going live in July 2026. Compliance is mandatory for all businesses that fall under the e-invoicing framework. Companies experimenting voluntarily are not subject to the penalties outlined by the authorities.Cabinet Decision No. 106 of 2025 outlines a structured penalty system for various breaches related to e-invoicing. These include:These penalties are cumulative and are designed to enforce discipline across all transactional and operational layers of a business.The decision also reinforces the importance of strong governance over business data. Companies must ensure that any changes to registered information are promptly communicated to the accredited service provider. Failing to do so triggers the same daily Dh1,000 fines, transforming master data management from an administrative task into a critical compliance requirement.Overall, the UAE’s approach positions e-invoicing as a regulated operational model, requiring businesses to invest in systems readiness, robust controls, and rapid incident response. Organizations that delay or mishandle compliance face clear financial consequences, making early preparation essential.","Businesses in the uae must comply with e-invoicing or face dh5,000 penalties.

Building the world’s factory of intelligence





Stargate campus and capacity plans





Economic and energy implications





Looking ahead









The United Arab Emirates is aiming to redefine the global AI landscape by planning to produce a staggering 60 trillion AI tokens at its Stargate AI campus in Abu Dhabi. Omar Al Olama, the UAE’s Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy, and Remote Work Applications, described this goal as a step toward transforming the country into the “world’s factory of intelligence. ”AI tokens are the smallest units of data that AI systems use to learn, process, and generate information. They break down text, images, audio, and video into manageable pieces, where each token can include letters, numbers, punctuation marks, or spaces. The process of converting raw data into these units is known as tokenisation.These tokens are essential for AI models to understand relationships within data, enabling tasks such as prediction, reasoning, and content generation. In modern AI systems, the speed and volume of token processing, referred to as token throughput, directly determine the system’s intelligence and output quality.A new type of data centre, called an AI factory, has emerged to handle this scale. Unlike conventional data centres, which primarily store and compute data, AI factories are optimized to process massive numbers of tokens efficiently, converting raw data into real-time insights.In this sense, AI factories manufacture intelligence at scale, and tokens serve as the currency of this production.At the Milken Middle East and Africa Summit in Abu Dhabi, Al Olama outlined the UAE’s vision for becoming the “world’s factory of intelligence.” He emphasized that AI factories like Stargate are designed to convert data into intelligence that can enhance decision-making, productivity, and quality of life. “The currency of the future is going to be tokens, that can be used and transformed into insights or intelligence that will help in decision making, improve the quality of life and improve productivity,” he said.The Stargate campus forms the core of the UAE’s AI ambitions. It is designed as a hyperscale facility with a planned capacity of 1 gigawatt, ultimately part of a larger 5GW AI campus in Abu Dhabi. By 2026, Stargate is expected to operate at 200 megawatts, with capacity scaled over time according to demand. “We are not looking at this blindly. We are going to increase capacity as demand increases as well. You can create a 5GW facility today … it could increase or decrease over time, but from where we stand today, 5GW is what we're going to have,” Al Olama said.He also addressed concerns about potential overvaluation in the AI sector, drawing parallels with the early internet era. “The dot-com bubble was a bubble in that time period. If you look at it in hindsight, the internet wasn't a bubble. The largest companies in the world became internet companies and it transformed our lives. If your time frame was five years, then the word bubble was right. If your time frame was 20, then the word bubble was wrong because the numbers today are much higher than they ever were. ”AI adoption is already delivering tangible economic benefits in the UAE. Al Olama revealed that AI tools in energy production have saved the country around Dh500 million ($136 million). Companies like Adnoc Distribution are leveraging AI to streamline operations, reduce production costs, and improve efficiency. “We have a metric for measurement when it comes to energy. How many barrels of oil are we producing? Or how can we reduce the cost of production using AI? We’ve had savings so far of around Dh500 million. We are seeing much more savings over time. The end product of that will be productivity gains, and it will be economic returns,” he said.The UAE’s approach positions AI tokens as a strategic national asset. With a planned 60 trillion tokens, equivalent to about 60 percent of global AI token production, the country is aiming to secure a commanding role in the global AI economy. Al Olama described token throughput as a modern equivalent to oil or rare earth minerals, emphasizing that controlling this capacity enables the UAE to export intelligence while supporting domestic innovation.While no specific timeline has been provided for achieving the 60 trillion token goal, the UAE is steadily progressing toward its target, guided by careful planning and international partnerships. Al Olama acknowledged uncertainties in scaling the project, stating, “No one is certain about anything, but the investment is there. As long as our partners work with us and we're able to get what we need at the right time, then we are certain. ”The Stargate AI campus represents more than just a technological project. It is a statement of intent, signaling the UAE’s determination to establish itself as a global AI powerhouse. With strategic infrastructure, economic incentives, and careful scaling, the Emirates is creating a sustainable AI ecosystem that could transform industries and redefine national competitiveness in the 21st century.","Uae’s stargate ai campus set to produce 60 trillion tokens, turning data into global intelligence.

Additional services: The card covers several other essential aspects to ensure a smooth and organized pilgrimage experience.



Digital and physical access





Saudi Arabia has taken a significant step to make the Umrah pilgrimage smoother and more organized for both domestic and international visitors. The Ministry of Hajj and Umrah has expanded the “Nusk” card, now available digitally for residents within the Kingdom and in printed form for pilgrims arriving from abroad.According to AJEL.SA , an Engineer Abdul Aziz Al-Mutahmi, Undersecretary of the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah for Digital Transformation, explained that the initiative, branded as “Nusk Al-Umrah,” aims to centralize essential pilgrimage services into a single, easy-to-use card. “The card facilitates a number of direct services for pilgrims,” Al-Mutahmi said in a telephone interview with Al-Ekhbariya channel.The card is designed to simplify logistical aspects of the pilgrimage, helping pilgrims access critical services quickly and efficiently. Among the services covered are:Domestic pilgrims can now use the card digitally through mobile devices, while international visitors will receive a printed version upon arrival. This dual approach ensures accessibility for all pilgrims, regardless of their origin or technological comfort level.With the introduction of “Nusk Al-Umrah,” Saudi Arabia continues to modernize the pilgrimage experience, combining technology with logistical planning to offer a safer, more convenient, and more connected journey for millions of worshippers each year.","Nusk al-umrah card offers digital services for domestic, printed access for international pilgrims.

Absher: Saudi ’s digital government platform

How does the new system work?

Bigger picture





Saudi Arabia introduced a new “Resident ID” system that replaces the old annual residency-renewal routine with a single, five-year card and a simplified online workflow. Officials and local outlets say the move will dramatically cut visits to passport and residency offices for over 13 million residents, reduce waiting times and move most transactions onto the Absher / e-services platforms.The core benefit is practical: instead of renewing an Iqama every year (and standing in long lines), residents will get a card valid for five years and renew digitally via Absher. Reports estimate this will eliminate tens of millions of annual visits to government counters and save households and the economy substantial time and cost. Fees mentioned in local coverage put the one-time five-year cost at roughly SAR 500 for adults and SAR 600 for domestic workers, replacing repeated annual payments.Absher is Saudi Arabia’s official digital platform that allows residents and citizens to access government services without visiting physical offices. Operated by the Ministry of Interior, it connects more than 350 services from different government entities in one place.Through Absher, users can renew residency permits, update personal information, pay government fees, book appointments, track applications, and receive official documents through registered postal addresses.It works across web and mobile apps, and every user has a secure digital profile linked to their identity.Absher has become one of Saudi Arabia’s most important digital-government tools, handling millions of transactions every day and reducing paperwork, queues, and in-person visits. The new Resident ID system relies on Absher as the main portal for issuing, renewing and managing the five-year ID, making the process fully online and significantly faster.The rollout is tied to Saudi’s digital services: applicants will be able to request and manage the Resident ID through Absher and related government platforms. The new ID is designed to work as a trusted digital identity (usable in transactions and verifications), and the authorities ask residents to register a postal address through the “Wasil”/“Wasil Digital” (Waṣil) mail service so official documents and the physical card are delivered reliably. The interior ministry’s e-services page has long supported the electronic issuance and renewal of resident documents, the new plan makes that the standard.This monumental policy shift is not just about convenience; it is a core pillar of Saudi Arabia's ambitious Vision 2030. The comprehensive strategy aims to modernize the government structure and transition the Kingdom into a global digital leader. By eliminating the time-consuming annual renewal cycle, the government expects to cut out an astonishing 65 million annual visits to public service offices over the next five years.This reduction in administrative clutter translates directly into massive economic gains. Experts predict the new electronic system will save the national economy over 2.6 billion Saudi Riyals by dramatically reducing wasted time and boosting overall productivity. Dr. Khalid, a Digital Government Expert, lauded the change, describing it as a ""qualitative leap, like moving from using copper coins to adopting bank cards.

MELBOURNE: Darcey Pritchard, 15, deleted Snapchat off her phone about a year ago when she felt sucked in by its algorithm.Her friend Luca Hagop, also 15, recently spent more than 34 hours on Instagram in one week, sharing pet videos and other reels ""so random, they're funny because they're so unfunny.""Amelie Tomlinson, 14, keeps up with her friends on Snapchat, and until recently, had almost no one's phone number.Her friend Jasmine Bentley, 15, is not allowed on any social media but dreams of being a content creator.The two sets of friends, living in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, Australia, offer a small window into the wildly different relationships today's teens have with social media. But they are united on one front: They do not think a new Australian law that bars children under 16 from having social media accounts, which takes effect Wednesday, will change their lives much.Australia passed the law a year ago, setting itself up to be a test case for what many parents say feels like this generation's Sisyphean task -- shielding children from the risks associated with social media until they are capable of navigating it responsibly.But these teenagers, born around the same time that Instagram and Snapchat were first released, are digital natives. Most know how to use VPNs, which may help them evade the ban.Many fudged their ages when they first signed up, to get around the minimum age of 13 for many social media services. Others have used their parents' information to get accounts, or have older siblings whose identities they can co-opt.More than anything, social media is just too deeply embedded into their lives.""It's how we communicate,"" Amelie said.Darcey said some of her friends had been talking about migrating to new apps. ""You're not going to stop these people,"" she said.In recent years, parents around the world have grappled with increasing alarm about social media's detriments to mental health, potential to enable online bullying and effects on developing brains.Australia was one of the first countries to pass a nationwide law to address those concerns. Last December, it set 16 as the minimum age for social media accounts, meaning hundreds of thousands of younger children would lose theirs. Other nations, like Malaysia, have followed suit with similar plans.Australia is putting the onus on the social media companies to keep younger children off their platforms and will not penalize parents or children who violate the law. Officials, including Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, have tried to tamp down expectations that the law will be an overnight fix.They say they are supporting parents who feel powerless against the lure of social media and peer pressure among teens. Anika Wells, the minister for communications, described an almost idyllic new reality with children awash in time for sports, baking or learning a new language.But it will be far from that simple. The lives and friendships of many 13- to 15-year-olds are enmeshed with social media -- even if the children are not on it themselves.For instance, when Darcey and her friends were playing an online guessing game, many of the clues were memes everyone else had seen on Instagram. When Amelie and a friend got to school 15 minutes before the first bell, they made four TikTok videos. When Jasmine puts on makeup, she will record herself, even though she is not on social media. And when Luca's mother died a few years ago, he found it helpful to type out his feelings on an anonymous server on Discord.Currently, 10 social media services are covered by the ban: Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, Twitch, X and YouTube. The companies have said that they do not believe a blanket ban is the best way to keep children safe, but that they will nevertheless deactivate accounts of children under 16.""They're ripping away something that has grown on us and become more part of our lives every day,"" Jasmine said.Two popular apps in Australia in the weeks leading up to the law were ""Yope,"" a photo sharing app targeting Generation Z, and ""lemon8,"" a TikTok alternative owned by the same parent company, ByteDance, portending a potential game of Whac-a-Mole with regulators.Luca jokes that Darcey lives under a ""1984"" regime when it comes to social media and phones, a nod to the all-controlling government in George Orwell's novel.Her parents have set daily time limits on apps for her and her two younger siblings -- for Darcey, five minutes on YouTube, 30 minutes for WhatsApp, 10 minutes on Spotify -- and ""downtime"" overnight.It is a careful equilibrium reached after many family discussions and a few charged, tearful fights. But it also means that after school on a recent afternoon, she spent hours talking to her father about her German homework, helping cook dinner and watching ""The Simpsons"" with her brothers, while her phone sat untouched in the designated spot on the kitchen counter. And when she found herself mindlessly scrolling on Snapchat, she herself decided to get off the app.Caroline and Joel Pritchard, Darcey's parents, said it seemed like a lonely uphill battle to restrict their children's phone usage.""It almost will feel like a bit of weight off our shoulders for the government to step in and go, hey, it's just banned,"" Joel Pritchard said. ""We can now turn around and say, 'Hey, it's not our choice.'""Darcey, who has been talking and thinking about social media's effects on her peers through her involvement in a youth-driven initiative called Project Rockit, said that limiting teenagers' use was only delaying the problem, and letting companies off the hook from making their platforms free of potentially harmful content.""It shouldn't be the user's fault,"" she said. ""The social media companies really need to take a bit more responsibility.""Luca, her friend since primary school, has always had free rein over his internet and phone use. He found a creative game building community on Discord -- which will not be affected by the law -- and enjoys science videos on YouTube.Instagram, he said, is just an easy pastime, which takes less effort than, say, setting up a board game. Even though at times he has felt ""trapped"" by its algorithm, he thinks he can outsmart it by shutting down the app when he sees videos he does not like.""Today I liked a few dog reels in a row, and then I got only dog videos for a few hours,"" he said on a recent afternoon, when he had stayed home sick from school.His father, Adrian Hagop, said he had always trusted that Luca and his older brother were mature and responsible enough to make their own decisions, and believed they should learn to deal with problems they may encounter online, rather than coddle them from unknown perils.His approach is to let them have those experiences and come to him to talk about it afterward if need be. Even after the ban, if Luca wants to be on social media, Hagop said he would help him get an account.""Both my kids are fairly skeptical, so I kind of trust them,"" he said. ""I think it depends on the kid.""When Amelie was trying to persuade her parents to allow her on TikTok, she pleaded her case in a five-page, single-spaced letter about not wanting to feel left out.Her mother, Catherine Best, said she felt that parents had lost control years ago. When Amelie had just started primary school, Best deleted YouTube off her daughter's school-required iPad because she was watching toy unboxing videos nonstop. The school insisted on reinstalling it because teachers used educational videos on YouTube in class.""That was really the gateway,"" said Best, who said the law was too little, too late. ""I feel like the horse has already bolted.""Amelie said that, like many of her friends, she had two TikTok accounts, both set to private: one for just close friends and the other for a wider group. The account with her friends has her age set to 19, so she was not worried about losing access.But she was exchanging phone numbers with friends for the first time in anticipation of losing her Snapchat account. This month, the app prompted her to verify her age -- set to 16 -- with a selfie, and it approved her as being old enough to continue using her account, she said.Amelie said she recognized how much she reached for her phone. Her screen time ""goes nuts"" on school holidays.""It's just an instinct to pick up my phone,"" she said, ""which I don't like.""Jasmine, a friend of Amelie's since the beginning of high school, said she felt like her generation's social media usage was misunderstood by grown-ups. Even though she is not on social media, her group of friends often film TikTok videos when they hang out.""There's a lot of creative freedom,"" she said. ""We're doing other things than just watching videos and scrolling, there's a lot more to it.""Her father, Craig Bentley, said even if Jasmine was inevitably exposed to social media, he felt better knowing she would always be with a friend, rather than scrolling on her own.Bentley, a high school teacher, said he had witnessed young minds shift as smartphones grew more pervasive, attention spans growing shorter and self-regulation dwindling.As for the law, he said, any effect would be for the better. At a minimum, he said, it will send the message that Australia will not stand for these apps taking control of a generation.""I hope there's a revolution against it and we all just decide it's not OK,"" he said.","A new australian law that bars children under 16 from having social media accounts takes effect wednesday.
