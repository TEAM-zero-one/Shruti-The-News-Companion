Third Stage Trouble Strikes Again: Inside ISRO’s PSLV-C62 Deviation And What The Failure Means Ahead

SRIHARIKOTA: The Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro) on Monday said that the PSLV-C62 mission encountered an anomaly during end of the PS3 stage and a detailed analysis has been initiated.""Today we have attempted the PSLV C62 / EOS - N1 Mission. The PSLV vehicle is a four stage vehicle with two solid stages and two liquid stages,"" Isro chief V. Narayanan said.""The performance of the vehicle close to the end of third stage was as expected. Close to the end of third stage we are seeing more disturbance in the vehicle. Subsequently, there is a deviation in the vehicle observed in the flight path. We are analysing the data and will come shall come back at the earliest,"" he added.Isro launched EOS-N1, along with 14 co-passenger satellites and a capsule into a re-entry trajectory in a marathon mission, marking the space agency’s first mission of 2026.The flight comes months after a rare setback, when PSLV-C61, launched on May 18, 2025, failed to place the EOS-09 earth observation satellite into orbit due to a third-stage anomaly.The 44.4-metre-tall Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV-C62) lifted off from the First Launch Pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, in a commercial mission for NewSpace India Limited (NSIL).The launch marked the 64th flight of PSLV and the fifth mission of the PSLV-DL variant.The mission carried a diverse suite of technology demonstration satellites from India and overseas, covering applications such as AI processing in orbit, store-and-forward communication systems, IoT services, radiation measurement, and agricultural data collection.The primary payload, EOS-N1 (Anvesha), is a hyperspectral earth observation satellite designed for advanced surveillance and strategic monitoring.Among the notable secondary payloads was AayulSAT, developed by Bengaluru-based startup OrbitAID Aerospace, which serves as India’s first on-orbit satellite refuelling demonstrator. The mission aims to test technologies for propellant transfer and satellite servicing in low Earth orbit, a capability seen as critical for extending satellite lifetimes and enabling sustainable space operations.Another key payload, the KID re-entry capsule, a European technology demonstrator developed with a Spanish startup, was expected to be separated from the PSLV’s fourth stage and was designed to splash down in the South Pacific Ocean, validating controlled atmospheric re-entry technologies.The flight also included a mix of CubeSats and small satellites from universities and startups, including missions from Dhruva Space (CGUSAT), and international partners, supporting research and commercial applications in communication, IoT and Earth observation.The 2026 PSLV-C62 mission follows Isro’s detailed review of the PSLV-C61 failure, one of only a handful of setbacks in PSLV’s three-decade operational history. Isro had constituted a failure analysis committee after the May 2025 mission and implemented corrective measures before returning the launcher to flight.","Isro launched eos-n1, along with 14 co-passenger satellites and a capsule into a re-entry trajectory in a marathon mission.

Bluebird Lift-Off Shows ISRO Commercial Power As Nambi Narayanan Calls LVM-3 Game Changer Move

BENGALURU: When OrbitAid's 25-kg Ayulsat lifts off aboard Isro's PSLV-C62 Monday, the mission's success will bring India a step closer to becoming the second country in the world to demonstrate on-orbit satellite refuelling, a capability so far claimed only by China, reports Chethan Kumar.Last year, China carried out a similar demonstration, but details remain limited and official disclosures sparse. No other spacefaring nation, including the US, has publicly demonstrated the technology in orbit. However, US firm Astroscale is developing a refuelling technology but is yet to launch.Ayulsat won't demonstrate a full on-orbit re-fuelling. It is designed as a target satellite to validate fuel transfer in the space environment. Unlike more complex servicing missions involving two spacecraft, OrbitAid's first step focuses on internal refuelling within a single satellite, allowing engineers to study how fluids behave in microgravity under real orbital conditions. OrbitAid founder and CEO Sakthikumar R told TOI the first refuelling is expected to take place within four hours of launch.",Orbitaid's 25-kg ayulsat lifts off aboard isro's pslv-c62 monday.

Deal St: Cognizant inks over $1bn contract with Novartis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/deal-st-cognizant-inks-over-1bn-contract-with-novartis/articleshow/126473146.cms,".

BENGALURU: Cognizant is learnt to have secured a deal worth over $1 billion from Swiss pharma major Novartis as part of a consolidation contract that includes renewals as well as new scope spanning application services, infrastructure, data and AI-led offerings, sources told TOI.This marks the second consecutive billion-dollar deal for Cognizant in less than a year, after it won a large contract from UnitedHealth Group last year. UnitedHealth ranks among Cognizant’s biggest customers, supported by a partnership spanning nearly two decades.When TOI reached out, a Cognizant spokesperson said the company is currently in a silent period and had no comment. An email sent to Novartis did not elicit a response until the time of going to press.Sources said Cognizant’s EMEA and APAC teams played a key role in clinching the deal under the leadership of Gagan Syal, head of life sciences for EMEA and APAC at Cognizant.Phil Fersht, CEO of USIT advisory HfS Research, said the rise in half-billion-dollar and larger IT services deals reflects a structural reset in how enterprises buy technology, rather than a surge in discretionary spending. “CIOs are aggressively consolidating vendors, bundling what were once multiple mid-sized contracts into fewer, broader and longer-term engagements with clearer accountability.These deals now typically span seven to ten years and combine transformation, run, cloud, data and AI under a single commercial construct, making the headline value appear larger even though annual spend is often comparable to legacy budgets,” he said. Fersht added that AI-led modernisation has become non-deferrable, as enterprises cannot pause core system renewal, cloud migration, cybersecurity or data platform investments, pushing deal sizes higher as “change plus continuity” are brought together.Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder of US-based Everest Group, said Cognizant has been the most aggressive among Indian-based providers in combining a strong vision for AI transformation with very competitive pricing. “This has positioned them to take share in a hyper-competitive market. The vendor consolidation trend, of which the Novartis transaction is a leading example, is ripe for this approach. We are aware of other large transactions where Cognizant is in the lead,” he said.Healthcare contributes around 30% to Cognizant’s revenue. Early in its growth journey, the company rapidly expanded its healthcare footprint, counting nine of the top 10 payers—including United, Anthem, Cigna and Aetna—as customers, along with nearly 30 major pharma companies such as Pfizer, Merck, Johnson & Johnson and Eli Lilly.Novartis operates three state-of-the-art centres in India across two cities—Hyderabad, where it has facilities at the Novartis Corporate Center (NOCC) and Genome Valley, and Mumbai. The company employs around 8,500 people in the country.India serves as a key hub in Novartis’s global operations, supporting the development of breakthrough medicines across therapy areas including cardiovascular, oncology, immunology, neurology and global health. The India centres support a wide range of global functions such as global clinical operations, technical R&D, patient safety and pharmacovigilance, regulatory affairs and advanced quantitative sciences, among others.","Cognizant is learnt to have secured a deal worth over $1 billion from swiss pharma major novartis.

NEW DELHI: The Defence Research and Development Organisation ’s Defence Research & Development Laboratory has successfully conducted a flight-test of the third-generation fire-and-forget man-portable anti-tank guided missile (MPATGM) with top attack capability against a moving target in the KK Ranges of Ahilya Nagar in Maharashtra. The test was conducted on Sunday.The anti-tank guided missile can be launched from a tripod or military vehicle launcher and its warhead is capable of defeating modern main battle tanks.Defence minister Rajnath Singh has lauded DRDO , development-cum-production partners (DcPP) and the industry for the successful test and called it an important step towards ‘ Aatmanirbhar Bharat ’.DRDO chairman Samir V Kamat said the trial target was successfully conducted, thereby leading the weapon system for induction into the Indian Army .The indigenously-developed MPATGM consists of state-of-the-art indigenous technologies like imaging infrared (IIR) homing seeker, all electric control actuation system, fire control system, tandem warhead, propulsion system and high-performance sighting system, which have been developed by DRDO's sister laboratories — Research Centre Imarat, Hyderabad, Terminal Ballistics Research Laboratory, Chandigarh, High Energy Materials Research Laboratory, Pune and Instruments Research & Development Establishment, Dehradun.The thermal target system was developed by the defence laboratory, Jodhpur, to simulate the target tank. The IIR seeker is well accomplished with day and night combat operation capability.

NEW DELHI: Isro 's PSLV-C62 rocket’s “deviating from its planned flight path” during the launch on Monday is a big setback for not only security agencies that lost crucial defence satellite EOS-N1 (Anvesha) but also several Indian and foreign institutions, startups and companies that lost 15 satellites possessing disruptive technologies that would have brought revolutionary changes in the space sector if they had reached their sun-synchronous orbit home at an altitude of 512 km.“We attempted the PSLV-C62 EOS-N1 mission. The PSLV is a four-stage vehicle - the first stage is a solid motor with two strap-ons, the second stage is liquid, the third stage is solid, and the fourth stage is liquid. The performance of the vehicle close to the third stage was as expected and as predicted,” Isro chairman V Narayanan said after the botched launch at the Sriharikota spaceport.“However, near the end of the third stage, we observed some disturbance in the vehicle, and there was a deviation in its flight path. As a result, the mission could not proceed as expected. We are now analysing the data from all ground stations, and once the analysis is complete, we will come back to you,” he said.DRDO's EOS-N1 (Anvesha), a strategic super-eye, was a hyperspectral imaging satellite capable of “seeing” in hundreds of wavelengths to identify materials on the ground—making it a high-priority asset for national security and surveillance.Had it been placed in orbit, it would have helped India secure its borders through its advanced remote sensing capabilities and would have also seen civilian application in areas such as agriculture, urban mapping and environmental observation.Last year too, India lost a crucial defence satellite, EOS-09, in space when the PSLV-C61 mission failed on May 18, 2025, due to an anomaly in the third stage, like this time. EOS-09 was an advanced Indian radar imaging satellite designed for all-weather, day-and-night surveillance, crucial for border monitoring, disaster response and resource management.The PSLV-C62 mission was also carrying KID or Kestrel Initial Technology Demonstrator from a Spanish startup. It was a small-scale prototype of a re-entry vehicle developed by the startup. KID was scheduled to be the last co-passenger to be injected, after which it was slated to re-enter the earth’s atmosphere towards splashdown in the South Pacific Ocean.Bengaluru-based space startup OrbitAID Aerospace was poised to make history with AayulSAT, India’s first on-orbit satellite refuelling payload. AayulSAT was aimed at extending satellite lifespans by enabling refuelling and servicing in orbit, addressing space debris and sustainability challenges.Hyderabad startups TakeMe2Space and Eon Space Labs were launching India's first orbital AI lab. It featured the MIRA telescope and a disruptive model to slash space data costs. Satellite MOI-1 would have taken photos from an altitude of 500 km and also processed them there itself.Other secondary payloads were cubesats developed by students of several universities and Indian startups, including CV Raman Global University's CGUSAT-1, Dhruva Space’s DA-1, Space Kidz India’s SR-2, Assam Don Bosco University’s Lachit-1, Akshath Aerospace’s Solaras-S4 and Dayanand Sagar University’s DSAT-1. All satellites are now lost in space.","Drdo's eos-n1 (anvesha), a strategic super-eye, was a hyperspectral imaging satellite capable of “seeing” in hundreds of wavelengths.

Isro sees warning in two consecutive PSLV failures,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-sees-warning-in-two-consecutive-pslv-failures/articleshow/126494434.cms,".

BENGALURU: Any space agency will tell you that every rocket launch comes with anxious moments, no matter what the record is. Yet, India's Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV) failing twice in consecutive attempts won't be easy for Isro to digest given its workhorse's record.PSLV has had 64 missions, of which four, including Monday's PSLV-C62, failed to put the spacecraft in orbit, and one in 1997 placed the payload on a lower orbit than the intended one. When a launcher is seen as proven, scrutiny can soften. But back-to-back failures need to be treated as a structural warning - not bad luck - as they suggest deeper issues, whether with quality control, supply chains, testing protocols, or configuration management.When PSLV-C61 failed last year, it brought down the rocket's success rate from 95.2% to 93.7%. Now, it has slipped further. Isro told TOI on Monday that the failures have affected the collective morale of the team. ""It would have been different if any other launcher failed, but a PSLV failure worries us,"" said a scientist.An analysis of setbacks shows that PSLV-C62's failure could have been caused by unresolved issues from the failed PSLV-C61 on May 18, 2025.In both cases, PS3, or the third stage - a solid motor that provides a high-energy boost after the second stage burnout - suffered a glitch.While Isro has not made the previous failure analysis committee (FAC) report public, TOI has learnt there was a fall in chamber pressure of the motor case. The PSLV-C62 will now be analysed by another FAC. Isro said there was disturbance in the ""roll rate"" during the final stages of PS3 burning on Monday, and that caused a deviation.Failures before 2025 all point to different glitches. The first setback was on Sept 20, 1993 when PSLV-D1, the rocket's first mission, failed due to a guidance system error during the separation of PS2 (a liquid stage).Isro launched again on Oct 15, 1994, and thereon PSLV showed no glitch until Sept 29, 1997, when PSLV-C1 mission became a ""partial success"". Here, the pressure regulator on PS4 (which uses twin liquid engines) failed, resulting in the satellite being placed in a lower-than-intended orbit.The 1997 glitch has not repeated. The next failure came 20 years later, in Aug 2017, when the PSLV-C39 mission failed. In this case, the problem was with the heat shield, which has since been rectified. After the PSLV-C39 mission, the launch vehicle had 21 successful flights before the failure last year, followed by Monday's.","India's polar satellite launch vehicle (pslv) failed twice in consecutive attempts.

Comparing Alex Ovechkin and Connor McDavid Car Collections

Alex Ovechkin: “My Car is like My Girl”

Alex Ovechkin and Connor McDavid are remarkable not only in the NHL for their super speed, skill, and all-around accomplishments but also for their very impressive passion off the ice. Besides hockey, these superstars are already taking a great interest in high-performance and luxury cars, thereby making their garages an extension of their characters. The sportsmen and the collectors are all amazed at how these athletes manage to exhibit the qualities of precision, power, and style in all aspects of their lives, whether on or off the rink.The discussion isn’t limited only to the rich; It also includes the love for cars, the selection, and the story each vehicle represents. Ovechkin’s favorites are the ones that symbolize bravado and control, reflecting his daredevil-esque playing style; on the other hand, McDavid’s automobiles imply subtlety, mastery, and accuracy—all the same qualities that he exhibits on the rink. It is very hard for the supporters not to put the two on the same scales when weighing who would be the ""winner"" in terms of horsepower and elegance, taken alongside their NHL awards.Alex Ovechkin had created a stronghold of sports cars in his garage. The star vehicle in his collection is the Mercedes-Benz SL65 AMG Black Series, which not only has an aggressive look but also a twin-turbo V12 engine that produces spectacular power; the Lamborghini Aventador is another beast in Ovechkin's collection that puts out over 700 hp.The already familiar to the fans BMW 5 Series, which was an early pick, still is in the collection, as it has sentimental value for Ovechkin, and a new luxury SUV presented as a gift for breaking records is another car that mirrors his developing likings. Ovechkin’s cars are high-octane, powerful, and made for those who want the world to notice them everywhere.On the other hand, Connor McDavid is the epitome of melodrama balanced with great precision. The Porsche 911 GT2 RS essentially is the car he would use for the track, while the Lamborghini Huracán and Audi R8 are the ones that present the attributes of high performance and flashy looks. McDavid’s storytelling through the use of cars shows the combination of performance and art, the mixing of showmanship and technical mastery. ESPN and NHL.com confirm that both players are very selective when it comes to filling their garages with cars, saying that each car is a manifestation of the athlete’s personality and career style.The supercar collections of both Ovechkin and McDavid are the perfect reflection of their rivalry on the ice, whether it be Ovechkin's sheer strength or McDavid's accuracy. Supporters may argue all day, but one thing is for sure: both athletes are outstanding in the rink as well as they drive off it.Also Read: Detroit Red Wings retire Sergei Fedorov’s iconic No. 91 jersey, closing a long‑awaited chapter","Alex ovechkin and connor mcdavid are remarkable not only in the nhl for their super speed, skill, and all-around accomplishments.

While she has many ideas and loves wedding details, insiders say she is consciously holding back to avoid overstepping. Despite the challenge, she shares a strong, positive relationship with Swift and supports the couple’s choices.

Why Donna Kelce is choosing restraint over control

With the wedding buzz about Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift still taking up most of the pop culture, there is one individual quietly balancing the emotional aspect behind the scenes. At the beginning of 2026, a short-term shift away from the couple was that of Travis mother Donna Kelce, who has gained a fanbase due to her increasing presence on TV and her open reputation.With Donna appearing on The Traitors and her son facing a tough NFL season, sources suggested that wedding planning brought a different kind of challenge. Not conflict, but restraint. According to insiders, Donna has strong ideas, a big heart, and the awareness to step back when it matters most.A source close to Donna told Daily Mail that she has made a conscious effort to stay out of the decision-making process, even though it does not come easily. The insider said,“When it comes to the wedding, the planning is all on Taylor and Travis, not on Donna. I think her head knows that, even when her heart wants to be more involved. She told me she has to bite her tongue when it comes to the wedding plans because she has all sorts of ideas.Location, menu, the cake, the colors. She lives for that stuff. But she doesn't want to be overbearing; she doesn't want to overstep.”Despite holding back, the relationship between Donna and Swift is reportedly strong. Another source emphasized the lack of tension, saying,“I don't think there's been any friction at all. On the contrary, it's all good. But she just thinks about that wedding all the time.”Behind the scenes, Travis is said to be fully involved in planning alongside Swift, treating the process as a shared responsibility. Reports also suggest the couple has already secured a venue and set a June 13, 2026 date. Looking back, the story highlights not wedding drama, but a mother choosing grace, patience, and trust as her son builds a new chapter.Also Read: “Don’t get mad”: Travis Kelce’s mom Donna reveals how her future daughter-in-law Taylor Swift shaped her mindset","Donna kelce is reportedly finding it difficult to stay on the sidelines as her son travis kelce and taylor swift plan their wedding.

To give you an idea, according to Baseball-Reference.com, Kyle Schwarber has raked in a whopping sum of $101,092,000 from his career earnings till 2025 not counting the 2026 ‍‌‍‍‌‍‌‍‍‌salary.Net worth estimates aren't usually shared in detail and can differ depending on the source. Some estimates use algorithms based on social factors, showing figures like $6.03 million in 2022, $7.04 million in 2023, $8.05 million in 2024, $9.05 million in 2025, and $10.1 million in 2026.Schwarber kicked off his MLB career when the Chicago Cubs picked him in the first round (4th overall) of the 2014 MLB June Amateur Draft, coming straight from Indiana University Bloomington.At first, his paychecks were pretty small, which is normal for a rookie and a pre-arbitration player, but his efforts played a big role in the Cubs clinching the 2016 World Series.In context, Schwarber was out for most of the 2016 season because of a torn ACL, but he made a stunning comeback in the World Series, batting .412 with seven hits in 17 at-bats. This impressive showing raised his profile, even though his pay was still at the entry-level.In 2021, Schwarber joined the Washington Nationals as a free agent on January 9, 2021, signing a one-year deal worth $7 million. This was his first experience with free agency and a chance to bounce back. Context: After the Cubs decided not to keep him, Schwarber teamed up with hitting coach Kevin Long in Washington, who assisted in fine-tuning his swing.Schwarber told MLB.com in a 2025 interview reflecting on his career: ""Long helped resurrect Schwarber’s career in Washington in 2021."" During the season, he was traded to the Boston Red Sox on July 29, 2021, and helped them in their playoff journey. With the Nationals, he earned a salary of $7,000,000. His total earnings amounted to $19,092,000.Schwarber's fortune took off when he inked a four-year, $79 million deal with the Philadelphia Phillies on March 16, 2022, which averages out to $19.75 million a year.This contract followed a solid 2021 season where he smashed 32 home runs between Washington and Boston.Phillies' baseball operations president, Dave Dombrowski, went after Schwarber because of his power and leadership qualities.His $19 million deal with the Phillies, along with a $3 million buyout from the Boston Red Sox, brings his total earnings to $41,092,000.Under the Phillies deal, Schwarber's pay stayed steady at $20 million each year, thanks to the back-loaded setup. He had his best season in 2025, hitting an NL-high 56 home runs and driving in 132 runs, which got him second in the NL MVP race, just behind Shohei Ohtani.In December 2025, Schwarber re-signed with the Phillies for a five-year deal worth $150 million, making it the biggest contract ever for a full-time designated hitter, according to CBS Sports. Here are the details from On Pattison: a signing bonus of $15 million; salaries of $15 million in 2026 and $30 million each year from 2027 to 2030.Regarding the luxury tax, the AAV stands at $30 million. Context: During the Winter Meetings in Orlando, Florida, Schwarber opted for Philadelphia instead of accepting similar offers from the Baltimore Orioles and other teams. In 2026: $30,000,000 ($15 million salary + $15 million bonus). Cumulative earnings: $131,092,000.Also Read: Bo Bichette’s tenure with the Toronto Blue Jays appears near its end as free agency continues into 2026","Schwarber kicked off his mlb career when the chicago cubs picked him in the first round (4th overall) of the 2014 mlb june amateur draft.

Risk and Outcome

The San Francisco Giants are being linked to one of the biggest pitching names expected to reach free agency after the 2025 season. Left-hander Ranger Suárez is drawing strong interest, with projections suggesting a deal that could land in the $160-200 million range.This is not a trade situation. Ranger Suárez is under contract with the Philadelphia Phillies through 2025. The discussion centers on what happens once he reaches the open market. The Giants are viewed as a serious contender, with the financial space to compete against teams like the New York Mets and Baltimore Orioles.San Francisco Giants have leaned on short-term pitching options such as Adrian Houser and Tyler Mahle. A long-term deal for Suárez would be a clear change in direction. Despite past hesitation around nine-figure contracts, the Giants are expected to be aggressive if they believe the fit is right.Suárez would likely slot near the top of the rotation behind Logan Webb. His groundball-heavy approach suits Oracle Park, where limiting home runs is critical. The Giants’ 2025 rotation struggled with injuries and uneven production, and Suárez offers stability.From the Phillies’ side, letting Suárez walk would not be a sign of retreat. With Andrew Painter nearing a full-time role, the team can afford to lose a veteran arm. They would gain draft compensation and free up payroll to address other needs without moving players in a trade.At age 30, Ranger Suárez is entering the most valuable stretch of his career. A six- to eight-year deal would provide long-term security. A move to San Francisco Giants also removes some of the pressure that comes with pitching in Philadelphia, while keeping him on a competitive team.There are concerns about a drop in velocity, which could affect durability over a long contract. Still, compared to higher-priced alternatives, Ranger Suárez offers consistency and fit.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Pittsburgh Pirates could sign $66 million ex-Cincinnati Reds star to bolster rotation and improve title odds If this signing happens, the San Francisco Giants would gain the most by adding a reliable starter to a thin rotation.

Beginning in 2026, the world faces economic insecurity, record inflation, and a cost-of-living crisis. But for the affluent few, it all appears far less significant than their bank accounts. Today, the total fortune of the world's 14 richest men exceeds $3 trillion in technology, luxury, fashion, AI, and investments. Elon Musk leads the league for the fifth year in a row, with a staggering $717.9 billion wealth that has nearly doubled in the last several years. In contrast, newcomers have joined this league as a result of AI and semiconductor storms, as well as anticipated investments. The symbolic wealth levels of this important few contrast with the growing disparity between the issues of the globe and the super-rich.As of 2026, the world’s wealthiest men continue to amass staggering fortunes despite global economic challenges. According to Forbes, the top 10 richest men, led by Elon Musk, now hold combined wealth exceeding $3 trillion, dominating sectors from technology and AI to luxury, fashion, and global investments, reshaping markets, influencing policy, driving innovation, and redefining modern economic power.Elon Musk, Tesla, SpaceX, and X’s CEO, sustains his dominance in the list of global billionaires.The value of Musk's net worth escalated from 2021’s $300 billion to 2026's $717.9 billion because of the phenomenal performance of electric cars, space exploration, and social media reach. Musk's entry and eventual support or endorsement of Donald Trump in politics made news but made no tangible contribution to or subtraction from his net worth. Tesla is leading in global electric cars, while SpaceX is working towards making rocket technology reusable. Musk's projects also cover energy storage, AI, and neural tech, providing him with multiple income streams. Musk's increases in net worth despite controversies, disagreements with authorities, or unpleasant encounters with influential persons in social media like Twitter make him the richest person in planet Earth.Co-founder of Google, Larry Page, has leaped to the second position in the worldwide list. There has been a remarkable increase in his wealth from 133.1 billion to 258.3 billion dollars in one year alone. Though Larry has kept himself away from the limelight, he has been pursuing long-term ventures such as the “moonshot” projects of Alphabet, which comprises self-driving automobiles and AI-based health care. Though he is no longer actively involved with Google, his impact on the company’s planning has ensured an increase in his wealth. He is the epitome of success for innovators who firmly believe that innovations related to the tech infrastructure of data enterprises will result in massive returns.Oracle founder Larry Ellison, who holds 98% ownership of Lāna‘i in Hawaii, has moved up to the third position for 2026. This follows his net worth rising from $199.5 billion. He has also served as a technology advisor for Artificial Intelligence policy and strategy with expertise gleaned from his years at Oracle. He has diversified his portfolio, including involvement with ‘real estate, sailing, and life sciences. Ellison has demonstrated his capacity to engage with entrepreneurship and diversify his reach globally, keeping him relevant as one of the most significant stakeholders among the wealthy across the world.Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon, has slipped to the fourth position, down from $248.1 billion last year. Bezos is a visibly successful person due to his dominance in online e-commerce, cloud computing through AWS, and media ventures like Prime Video. Bezos has had enormous success due to decades of expansion, acquisitions, and reach, but he still invests in space technology through Blue Origin, along with philanthropic work in climate change and healthcare.Sergey Brin, Google co-founder, is at number five with a net worth of $238.4 billion. The position is an improvement from last year, when he ranked fifth with a net worth of $155.4 billion. Sergey Brin's net worth has been strengthened by Alphabet’s success in AI, cloud computing technology, and autonomous driving technology. Sergey Brin is still engaged in innovation and is a major beneficiary of Alphabet's long-term initiatives.Facebook’s founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has also minutely slid out from the top five richest people, with a wealth ranking of $223 billion from the previous year’s assessment of $219.9 billion. Mark Zuckerberg keeps pushing the initiatives for the “metaverse,” AI, and social networking. Zuckerberg’s presence in shaping technology policies and trends around the world has not changed, even though there are certain fluctuations.France's luxury leader, Bernard Arnault, has fallen to the sixth spot from the first position in 2024, but the value of his net worth, which is sourced from the success of LVMH as well as brands such as Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Sephora, is still a remarkable $192.4 billion, slightly lower from the previous year's $195.1 billion, thus symbolizing the timeless use value of exclusive luxury products.A Taiwanese national, Nvidia's co-founder, Jensen Huang, has experienced tremendous growth because of the AI and silicon revolution. His net worth increased from 128.4 billion to 163.9 billion dollars. Huang's vision to develop chips for the gaming, AI, and data center markets has made him one of the leading tech billionaires globally.The 95-year-old investment guru and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway has an estimated net worth of $146.8 billion, a marginal improvement from $143.4 billion. The key to Mr. Buffett’s achievement is his long period of value investing and his knack for investing in businesses during favorable times and diversifying his investment portfolios across various sectors.Amancio Ortega, the Spanish fashion tycoon behind Zara, is still a giant in the industry with an estimated wealth of 145 billion dollars. His success in the fast-fashion industry has been fueled by expansion and supply chain management. Amancio Ortega proves that the success in the affordable fashion industry translates to the accumulation of unimaginable wealth.","Elon musk, tesla, spacex, and x’s ceo, sustains his dominance in the list of global billionaires. Co-founder of google, larry page, has leaped to the second position in the worldwide list. The total fortune of the world's 14 richest men exceeds $3 trillion in technology, luxury, fashion, ai, and investments.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126415089,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-47860,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Against a persistent demand–supply gap, the government had extended the import duty exemption on cotton until December 31, 2025, a move that was welcomed by textile associations.However, with no further notification issued, the 11 per cent duty was reinstated from January 1, 2026. CITI said the move would adversely impact the competitiveness of India’s textile and apparel sector.The minister assured the delegation that the concerns raised would be carefully examined during the review process, CITI said.The industry body also flagged a steady decline in domestic cotton production, which it said is projected to fall to its lowest level in nearly two decades this year, intensifying concerns over supply shortages.CITI argued that reimposing the import duty would further aggravate cost pressures for manufacturers. It pointed out that over the past decade, India’s average cotton imports stood at around 20 lakh bales, accounting for about 6.8 per cent of average domestic production.Imports, the industry body said, are largely quality- and specification-driven, catering to specialised requirements and back-to-back export orders, and do not displace domestic cotton.CITI also highlighted that competing textile-exporting countries such as Bangladesh and Vietnam allow duty-free cotton imports, giving them a structural cost advantage in global markets.The demand comes at a time when the textile and apparel sector — one of India’s largest sources of employment and livelihoods — is facing fresh headwinds from a 50 per cent US tariff effective August 27, 2025. Cotton-based products dominate India’s textile exports.The US is India’s single-largest textile and apparel export destination, accounting for nearly 28 per cent of total export revenues. Exports to the US were valued at close to $11 billion in FY2024-25, according to industry data.",The confederation of indian textile industry (citi) has urged the government to permanently remove the 11 per cent import duty on cotton in the union budget 2026.

From Tampa Bay to retirement and the income shift that followed

When Tom Brady packed up and left the New England Patriots for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2020, it felt risky in every sense. He was in his forties, stepping away from the only franchise he had ever known, and walking into a league that was rapidly getting younger. Financially, though, Brady was already secure. His net worth at that point was estimated, according to Forbes, at around $250 million, built slowly through years of contracts that were rarely the biggest on the market, combined with endorsements and long-term brand deals.ID@undefinedCaption not available.Then Tampa happened. Winning a Super Bowl in his first season with the Buccaneers did more than add another ring. It reshaped how Brady was viewed, not just as a quarterback, but as a business asset. He proved he could win outside the Patriots system, and that mattered enormously for his value off the field. By the end of the 2020 season, his earning power had grown, even though his paycheck had not dramatically changed.In 2021, Brady kept going. He played at an elite level, stayed visible, and remained relevant in a league that usually moves on quickly.His net worth rose to around $260 million, driven less by football salary and more by the fact that his brand refused to fade. While younger quarterbacks were signing massive contracts early in their careers, Brady was showing that staying power could be just as valuable. By 2022, his final season in the NFL, Brady’s net worth reached roughly $280 million, according to Investopedia..His total career salary had crossed the $330 million mark according to Spotrac, but the bigger story was what came next. Retirement did not mean slowing down but shifting gears.In 2023, Brady walked away from the game knowing exactly what came next. He was done taking hits, but he wasn’t stepping into the unknown. His long-term broadcasting deal meant the paychecks would keep coming, just without the wear and tear of another NFL season. By then, his net worth had climbed to around $300 million, and that was before he had fully settled into life after football.Over 2024 and 2025, the money side of his career stayed steady and kept moving upward. Instead of game checks, Brady’s income came from business ventures, endorsements, and ownership stakes.By 2026, Brady’s net worth is between $300 million and $350 million approximately, depending on how his investments and businesses are valued.Compared to today’s quarterback model, the contrast is clear. Players like Patrick Mahomes of the Kansas City Chiefs locked in generational wealth early. Brady took a slower, more patient route. From Tampa Bay to retirement, Brady’s money story mirrors his career. He did not chase quick wins. He built something designed to last long after the final whistle.Also read: Jacoby Brissett’s current net worth: Inside the career earnings of the NFL quarterback who turned opportunity into millions","Tom brady left the new england patriots for the tampa bay buccaneers in 2020.

Details on Leon Draisaitl's luxury car collection



Leon Draisaitl, a two-time NHL Art Ross Trophy winner, has made a name of being exceptional both on and off the ice. Outside of hockey, being an Edmonton Oilers player, Draisaitl is a person who enjoys quality and modest cars. He does not belong to the group that prefers high-powered sports cars but prefers comfort, practicality, and long-term value in his car purchases.The luxury car collection by Draisaitl shows that he is connected to his German heritage but with a contemporary style. His collection has received extensive coverage in other media, such as YouTube reviews and car coverage, which gives fans an idea of the lifestyle of one of the best stars in the NHL.The main product that Draisaitl features in his ambassador position with the brand is the Genesis GV80, a luxury SUV that he drives. A review on YouTube argues that Genesis has quality craftsmanship and modern design, which is in line with the idea of Draisaitl, who is fond of understated but luxurious cars.In Ontario, Draisaitl was seen in a Jeep Wrangler Rubicon and a Jeep Grand Cherokee, which combine both competency and rough versatility. These options reflect his practicality without loss of style, which is ideal when it comes to outdoor activities or city driving.German engineering is also something that Draisaitl likes, and he owns a vehicle such as the Volkswagen Tiguan and the BMW models, among other cars. These choices give him a real connection to his German roots and can provide him with reliable and high-performance cars. His luxury car line consists of an extended lifestyle: grounded, personal, and planning, with lifestyle and functional excellence.To the NHL news outlet enthusiasts or those interested in tracking the lifestyle stories of the Edmonton Oilers, the choice of cars Draisaitl drives should provide an idea of how even high-performance, high comfort, and high personal branding athletes can balance their choices.
