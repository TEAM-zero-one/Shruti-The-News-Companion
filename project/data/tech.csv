MUMBAI: Bullion markets in India and abroad continued to see hectic activity as prices of gold and silver rose to record levels in both markets. As jitters are being felt across markets, especially due to shortage of supply of the white metal, Tata MF temporarily suspended inflows into its silver ETF fund of fund (FoF). And outside of India, Bank of America raised its target for gold to $5,000/ounce, a rise of nearly 25% from current levels and $65/oz for silver, a 30% appreciation.The global supply crunch has hit the silver market at a time when the demand for the metal, used in industries like solar and EVs, is rising. In addition, rate cuts in the US, which is making the dollar cheaper against major currencies are also leading to higher demand for silver and gold.In international markets, since these metals are priced in dollar, a weaker greenback would translate to fall in prices of these two precious metals, leading to higher demand. In the domestic market, silver prices hovered close to the Rs 1.8 lakh/kg level, a new all-time peak, while gold traded at close to Rs 1.3 lakh/10gm level. Late on Monday, on MCX, the futures prices for gold for Dec delivery was at close to Rs 1.25 lakh while silver futures for Dec delivery was trading at close to Rs 1.55 lakh level.During the day, Tata MF suspended purchases, switchins, fresh SIPs etc into its Silver ETF FoF, effective Oct 14. Tata MF is the fourth fund to take this step to protect investors’ interest. Kotak MF was the first one, followed by SBIMF and UTIMF to take such a decision for their silver ETF FoF.","Bullion markets in india and abroad continued to see hectic activity as prices of gold and silver rose to record levels.

Delhi government plans ride-hailing service,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhi-government-plans-ride-hailing-service/articleshow/124540849.cms,"



NEW DELHI: Delhi government plans to launch the city's first ever cooperative ride-hailing service, aiming to offer drivers an alternative to corporate platforms while providing passengers more affordable, surge-free options.Officials said the service would ensure drivers retain 100% of their earnings, wherein they don't have to pay any commission to cab aggregators. Officials of the registrar cooperative society have been tasked with preparing a detailed blueprint to take the plan forward.Cooperative minister Ravinder Indraj announced the initiative during the annual general meeting of Delhi Citizen Cooperative Bank on Sunday, describing it as part of govt's larger effort to ""revitalise the cooperative movement in the city with new direction and energy"".Speaking to TOI on Monday, Indraj said, ""I have asked officials to prepare a feasibility report and develop a framework so Delhi can get cooperative taxi-hailing service. The details are being worked out, but we intend to roll it out soon.""Delhi's scheme draws inspiration from the Sahkar Taxi cooperative currently being developed in Maharashtra and other states, a concept championed by the Union ministry of cooperation.Earlier this year, Union home minister Amit Shah announced plans for a cooperative taxi service across the country that would include registration of two-wheelers, taxis, rickshaws and four-wheelers under a single umbrella. The profits generated would be shared equitably among driver-members, bypassing corporate intermediaries.In Delhi, the proposed service will operate through a dedicated app, connecting passengers directly with driver-members of the cooperative. Unlike conventional corporate-run ride-hailing firms, the platform will be owned and managed by the drivers themselves. This model seeks to eliminate commission charges, promising fair and transparent pricing.""The main objective is to uplift taxi drivers by improving their income, working conditions and overall quality of life. By making drivers active members and stakeholders, govt hopes to build a sustainable model that benefits drivers and consumers alike,"" said an official.Passengers, too, stand to gain from the cooperative framework, with promises of reliable service, transparent fares, and no unexpected price surges. ""This approach aims for a win-win scenario where drivers enjoy social security benefits and fair profit-sharing, while commuters get affordable rides,"" the official added.Maharashtra's Sahkar Taxi is expected to start operations by Dec 2025. Delhi's model will be tailored specifically to the capital's unique needs and commuting patterns, said Indraj. ""Our service won't be an exact replica of Maharashtra's, but will be designed to suit Delhi's conditions,"" he told TOI.The official said the app will directly connect passengers with drivers. The cooperatives will govern the platform, maintain transparent fare slabs, and ban algorithmic price hikes. Delhi govt will also facilitate necessary regulatory clearances to smooth the rollout, he added.Taxi industry representatives have welcomed the move. Sanjay Samrat, president, Delhi Taxi and Tourist Transporters Association, said, ""Cab aggregators take up to 40% commission on every ride, severely cutting into drivers' earnings. When these firms were launched, their commission was zero, but that has changed drastically.""Samrat said the cooperative scheme should allow the registration of both existing and new CNG vehicles. ""Forcing drivers to switch only to electric vehicles will be difficult because of high cost and limited profitability,"" he said, urging govt to provide affordable loans to drivers to buy vehicles.","Delhi government plans to launch the city's first ever cooperative ride-hailing service.

Friendship whispers resurface after Blake Lively’s lawsuit drama

How Travis Kelce fits into Taylor Swift’s redefined circle



As Taylor Swift continues her global domination with The Life of a Showgirl, fans are now shifting their attention from her chart-topping music to her rekindled friendships and perhaps even her relationship balance with NFL star Travis Kelce . The latest whisper comes from Deuxmoi, where insiders claim Swift and her longtime friend Blake Lively may have quietly reunited after months of rumored distance.According to Deuxmoi’s October 9th Deux/U podcast, a discreet source revealed that Taylor Swift and Blake Lively “may have allegedly seen each other in the last few weeks.” The insider described the encounter as “not strained, rather friends just being friends.” The rumor comes months after Lively’s public “It Ends With Us” lawsuit against actor Justin Baldoni, which narrowly brushed against Swift’s name.While details remain private, the speculation has sparked excitement among fans who feared the pair’s friendship had fizzled. Observant Swifties also pointed out that Taylor Swift was recently spotted wearing a Lorraine Schwartz bracelet—the same one Blake Lively wore to the It Ends With Us London premiere in 2024. Was it a subtle nod of support, or just another of Swift’s famous Easter eggs?Adding another layer, Taylor Swift’s track “CANCELLED!” from her new album has stirred conversation for its apparent empathy toward a friend facing public backlash. Many believe the song was inspired by Lively’s experience, a move that would mark Swift’s quiet show of loyalty rather than shade.As Swift navigates her increasingly public relationship with Travis Kelce, some fans wonder whether her time in Kansas City and her global tour life have naturally distanced her from Hollywood friends. Yet, if reports of a Lively-Swift reunion are true, it could signal that the pop star is rebalancing her worlds, one where the NFL and Hollywood coexist peacefully.Also Read: “Shape of a….”: Taylor Swift’s ‘Wood’ sparks chaos as fans uncover steamy new hidden tour detail and Travis Kelce reacts Swift, who is the godmother to Lively and Ryan Reynolds’ children, seems unlikely to let that bond fade completely.

In the rapidly evolving world of AI-powered content, Elon Musk has taken a bold step forward. On October 5, 2025, he unveiled Grok Imagine Version 0.9, a major update to his AI platform designed to generate text, images, and videos with unprecedented speed, accuracy, and realism across multiple creative formats, including virtual reality environments and interactive storytelling. This launch comes just days after OpenAI’s Sora 2 release on September 30, intensifying the competition in AI video generation, creative technology, and immersive digital experiences.Musk’s announcement underscores his ambition to transform both the entertainment and gaming industries through generative AI, while also sparking debate about the potential limitations, job displacement, societal impact, and ethical considerations of AI-generated content.Grok Imagine 0.9 introduces several cutting-edge improvements that make AI content generation faster and more versatile than ever. Musk detailed these features on X (formerly Twitter):These upgrades highlight Musk’s goal of creating a multi-functional AI platform capable of producing movies, short videos, and interactive media at scale.Musk’s vision extends beyond video and image creation. In a recent X post, he revealed that his xAI game studio plans to release a “great” AI-generated video game before the end of 2026.A shared clip demonstrated a rudimentary first-person shooter, reminiscent of popular titles like Call of Duty, showcasing the potential of AI in gaming.To further this initiative, xAI is actively hiring a Video Games Tutor, offering $45–$100 per hour to train Grok to produce “engaging, fun, and innovative video games.” The role emphasises AI-assisted game design, including accurate annotations, iterative testing, and fostering interactive entertainment. This development aligns with industry trends. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney predicts that AI prompts will allow small development teams to create games on the scale of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, unlocking entirely new genres and gameplay experiences previously impossible without AI.Despite the excitement, many industry experts remain cautious about AI’s creative capabilities. Michael “Cromwelp” Douse, publishing director at Larian Studios, emphasized that AI cannot replace human leadership, vision, or storytelling. According to Douse, AI-generated content may lack the emotional resonance and artistry required to truly engage audiences.Critics also point to the challenge of maintaining cultural and creative authenticity in both video games and movies. While AI can produce technically perfect results, the human touch—the skill, imagination, and cultural insight—remains central to crafting meaningful experiences.Musk’s ambitions are equally significant in the film industry. He recently predicted that Grok will produce a movie that is “at least watchable before the end of next year” and will deliver high-quality films by 2027. A six-second video clip of generic Hollywood-style action accompanied the tweet, illustrating the AI’s growing cinematic capabilities.However, generative AI in movies has sparked controversy. The emergence of AI-generated actors, such as Tilly Norwood, has elicited backlash from Hollywood. Furthermore, concerns about copyright infringement persist, as AI platforms—including Grok—have faced legal challenges for generating content using copyrighted characters. For instance, Grok-generated images of Nintendo’s mascot were removed from Twitter due to takedown notices. Disney and Universal have also taken legal action against AI companies for unauthorized use of their characters. Grok Imagine 0.9 represents a pivotal moment in AI content generation, bridging the worlds of video, film, and gaming. Musk’s predictions indicate a future where AI can create movies, games, and interactive experiences with unprecedented speed, while also raising questions about ethics, creativity, and copyright.Industry experts argue that while AI is a powerful tool, human creativity and oversight remain essential. The future of AI-driven filmmaking and gaming will likely involve a hybrid approach, combining AI’s technical efficiency with the artistry and vision of human creators.","Elon musk’s grok imagine 0.9 boosts ai video, text, and image creation.

AI embedded across JPMorgan



Big AI bets under scrutiny







JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon recently gave a clear warning about the disruption power of artificial intelligence. Dimon believes that job losses are inevitable, but so is the opportunity to retain and deploy workers into new roles. As reported by Business Insider, In an interview with Bloomberg TV, Dimon said that the bank has invested about $2 billion as an annual investment in AI and is already making $2 billion in direct benefits. This includes the headcount reductions and operational savings. “We know about $2 billion of actual cost saves,” he said. “It’s the tip of the iceberg.”Dimon also talked about layoffs and he did not shy away from the workforce implications. “People shouldn’t put their head in the sand. It is going to affect jobs,” he said. “AI will enhance some aspects of work, but also eliminate some jobs.” However, Dimon also stressed on the fact that JPMorgan is focused on retaining and redeploying employees whose roles are impacted by automation. “We’ll have more jobs, but there’ll probably be less jobs in certain functions,” Dimon added. “You’re better off being way ahead of the curve,” Dimon added.Dimon also revealed that JPMorgan has been integrating AI since 2012. He said that AI now touches every part of the bank starting from rest and fraud detection to marketing and customer service. The bank also used AI for idea generation. he bank’s proprietary large language model, trained on internal data, is used by 150,000 employees weekly. “It’s quite productive,” Dimon noted. “Our managers and leaders have to do it. ”Dimon’s remakes come at a time when skepticism is growing about the massive corporate spending spree on AI. Meta is planning to spend around $600 billion on AI infrastructure by 2028. On the other hand, OpenAI and Oracle have announced a $500 billion data center project dubbed Stargate.A recent Goldman Sachs report warned that many firms investing billions in AI have yet to see measurable returns. “AI technology is exceptionally expensive,” said Jim Covello, head of global equity research at Goldman Sachs. “Even basic summarization tasks often yield illegible and nonsensical results.”","Jpmorgan chase ceo jamie dimon believes that job losses are inevitable, but so is the opportunity to retain and deploy workers into new roles.

IT minister Ashwini Vaishnaw switches to Zoho

“I am moving to Zoho — our own Swadeshi platform for documents, spreadsheets & presentations. I urge all to join PM Shri @narendramodi Ji’s call for Swadeshi by adopting indigenous products & services,”





Indian digital mapping company MaymyIndia has expressed gratitude to Union IT and Railways Minister Ashwini Vaishnav for publicly praising the company’s indigenous navigation platform, Maples, calling it a ‘great swadeshi app’. In a post shared on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Vaishnaw wrote, “Mappls by MapmyIndia is a great swadeshi app. Let’s use more such apps and support our own ecosystem.” This endorsement made by minister was met with appreciation from MapmyIndia, which responded, “Thank you Hon’ble Minister @AshwiniVaishnaw ji for your kind words and support for #Swadeshi #Aatmanirbhar apps like #Mappls.

Real-world application matters more than technological supremacy







Alibaba Group chairman Joe Tsai has challenged the prevailing narrative of US-China artificial intelligence competition, arguing that the race has no definitive winner because success should be measured by adoption speed rather than model superiority. ""When it comes to AI, there's no such thing as winning the race. It's a long marathon,"" Tsai said at the All-In Summit 2025 in September, with recordings posted Wednesday. He emphasised that the AI race isn't about who builds the biggest or most powerful model — it's about who can deploy AI faster.Tsai said the US should focus more on adoption and diffusion of AI instead of spending billions on developing larger models. He argued that ""every week there's a model that's leading, but then the next week another model overtakes them,"" making model superiority a fleeting achievement.The contrasting strategies between the two nations highlight fundamental differences in AI development philosophy. US tech companies have been spending billions, with Meta expecting to spend $600 billion on AI infrastructure through 2028, while OpenAI and Oracle announced plans for a $500 billion data center project.Meanwhile, China's AI play focuses on lean, efficient models — cheaper, lighter, and easier to deploy. DeepSeek's R1 model, which disrupted the AI industry and US stock market earlier this year, rivals top competitors but was built at a fraction of the cost.Tsai highlighted China as an example of faster adoption, noting companies are embracing open-source and smaller models optimised for real-world use on mobile devices and laptops.Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang echoed similar concerns about America's adoption pace. Huang said China's under-regulation at the industrial level makes the country ""quick in adopting new technology,"" with the country aiming for 70% AI adoption by 2027.""I'm not saying China technologically is winning in the model war, but in terms of the actual application and also people benefiting from AI, it has made a lot of development,"" Tsai stated.Instead of trying to outbuild leading players like OpenAI, China focuses on rolling out AI across everyday tech at breakneck speed, which could prove just as crucial as model quality in determining overall AI competitiveness.","China's lean approach versus america's massive spending strategy highlights fundamental differences in ai development philosophy.

The H-1B visa programme has long served as a critical gateway for global talent to contribute to the United States’ economy, particularly in technology, healthcare, and academia, helping to fill key skill gaps and drive innovation. Recently, the Trump administration has signalled sweeping reforms beyond the previously proposed $100,000 mandatory fee, which has raised significant concerns among current H-1B holders, prospective applicants, and industry stakeholders. According to a note from the US Department of Homeland Security titled “Reforming the H-1B Nonimmigrant Visa Classification Program,” the administration is considering multiple changes, including revising eligibility for cap exemptions, increasing oversight of employers with prior violations, and tightening regulation of third-party job placements, as widely reported. These proposals are expected to be formally published in December this year.Weeks before the proposed rule changes, President Donald Trump announced that employers would be required to pay a $100,000 fee for each H-1B visa application. This declaration caused immediate panic among the Indian diaspora and other foreign workers on H-1B visas. Many visa holders and their families, who were temporarily outside the US for work or travel, scrambled to return within 24 hours to avoid being stranded or denied entry.The situation eased slightly when White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt clarified that the fee would be a one-time charge applicable only to new petitions and not an annual cost. Despite this clarification, the proposed restrictions continue to generate concern among employers and employees alike, particularly in sectors heavily reliant on foreign talent.H-1B visa holders are not limited to tech roles; roughly a third work in essential sectors such as healthcare, education, religious services, and academia, as highlighted in a recent lawsuit challenging the reforms. Tech companies, in particular, fear that the reforms could disrupt hiring practices, limit access to high-skilled talent, and make the US less competitive on a global scale.Several prominent tech leaders began their US careers under the H-1B visa system, demonstrating its crucial role in fostering innovation and economic growth.Satya Nadella, born in Hyderabad, India, moved to the US in the early 1990s. He secured an H-1B visa to work at Microsoft, where he rose through the ranks to become CEO in 2014. Nadella has consistently highlighted the critical role of skilled immigrants in fostering innovation and growth, emphasizing that many of Microsoft's most transformative projects have been driven by talent brought to the US through the H-1B program.Sundar Pichai, originally from Madurai, Tamil Nadu, India, moved to the US for higher studies. After completing his education, he transitioned to an H-1B visa, which allowed him to join Google. Over the years, he rose to become CEO of Alphabet, overseeing key innovations in AI, Google Cloud, and hardware like Pixel phones and Nest devices. Pichai has emphasized that immigration has been instrumental in America's technological leadership and Google's success, and he has publicly advocated for policies that expand opportunities for skilled immigrants.Aravind Srinivas, born in Chennai, India, moved to the US for higher education and later transitioned to an H-1B visa. He is the founder and CEO of Perplexity AI, a company specializing in generative AI. Despite challenges posed by immigration policies, Srinivas underscores that the US remains a meritocratic environment where talent and innovation are recognized. He emphasizes that the primary challenge for immigrants is not the increase in H-1B visa fees but finding trustworthy mentors and investors.Jayshree Ullal, originally from London and New Delhi, moved to the US at 16 to pursue higher education. She began her career on an H-1B visa and rose through several top tech companies to become CEO of Arista Networks. Ullal has been a vocal advocate for the H-1B visa program, emphasizing its importance in attracting global talent to the US She has also highlighted the challenges of the US immigration process, noting the long wait times for permanent residence approvals.Arvind Krishna, hailing from Dehradun, India, moved to the US in the 1990s on an H-1B visa. He steadily advanced to become CEO of IBM. Krishna has consistently advocated for the US to remain an international talent hub, stressing that global collaboration and access to foreign talent are essential for innovation and economic competitiveness.The H-1B visa programme has historically enabled the United States to attract some of the world’s brightest minds, driving innovation and economic expansion across multiple sectors. As proposed reforms take shape, leaders like Satya Nadella, Sundar Pichai, Aravind Srinivas, Jayshree Ullal, and Arvind Krishna illustrate the tangible benefits of such a programme. Any policy changes must strike a careful balance between national interests, global competitiveness, and the livelihoods of millions of skilled workers who contribute to the US economy.","The h-1b visa programme has long served as a critical gateway for global talent to contribute to the united states’ economy.

What has made cyber attacks more dangerous





The National Stock Exchange (NSE) reportedly faces approximately 170 million cyberattacks daily, necessitating a dedicated team of ""cyber warriors"" to ensure seamless operations. ""Every day, millions of cyberattacks target the NSE, but our technical teams, supported by advanced systems and specialized software, combat these threats round the clock,"" a senior NSE official told PTI. The official noted that the exchange encounters 150 to 170 million cyberattacks daily, posing a significant challenge for its teams and systems.Recently, a group of journalists from Jammu and Kashmir visited the NSE to observe its management facilities, cyber defense centers, and backup systems. The NSE’s twin cyber defense centers operate in constant battle mode, equipped with upgraded software to neutralize and repel large-scale attacks on the financial market infrastructure 24/7, year-round. ""The robust cybersecurity architecture, combining tech-savvy personnel, machines, and technology, ensures the safety of NSE’s operations,"" the official told PTI.To bolster security, the NSE mandates Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing (VAPT) for all trading members and staff to maintain system integrity.During 'Operation Sindoor,' a DDoS simulation, the NSE recorded an unprecedented 400 million cyberattacks in a single day, the highest ever. Despite this, attackers failed to cause damage due to the coordinated efforts of personnel, machines, and advanced technology. A DDoS attack floods a server with traffic from multiple sources, aiming to crash or make it unavailable to legitimate users, a critical threat to industries like the stock market that rely on uninterrupted operations. As a precaution during this period, the NSE temporarily restricted access to its website for foreign users.Maharashtra Cyber had identified seven Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups responsible for launching over 15 lakh cyber attacks targeting critical infrastructure websites across India following the Pahalgam terror strike in April this year. Of these, only 150 attacks were reportedly successful. This means a failure rate of 99.99% or should one say abysmal success rate of 0.01%. The methods used by hackers included malware campaigns, Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, and GPS spoofing. The defacement of Indian websites was also reported.The NSE leadership said that a breach could impact not only the exchange’s systems but also ""whatever is connected to us,"" highlighting the ripple effect of digital vulnerabilities across interconnected networks. Officials said that growing global interconnectedness and system complexity have heightened the risk of large-scale cyberattacks, posing a significant threat to financial market stability. They further noted that the potential for low-cost, large-scale cyberattacks on financial market infrastructure remains a major global risk.","The national stock exchange (nse) reportedly faces approximately 170 million cyberattacks daily.

""It's not about skin color or anything. It's about what kind of country do you want to leave your kids, and do you have the right to object to the policies that are seemingly affecting my children?

Sophie Grégoire, ex-wife of Justin Trudeau , posted an uncanny message on Instagram on Monday, day after photos surfaced online showing the former Canadian Prime Minister kissing pop singer Katy Perry aboard her yacht.The post hinted at moving on, with Grégoire postin: “The people, the places, even the moments that once felt, I don’t know, infinite—time asks us to not cling to them. And yet we do, I do, because to hold on feels safer than to let go.”Grégoire continued, “Love was never about possession. It was always about presence, the present moment. And when we release what we cannot keep, we make space for the truth of connection, intimacy, the memory, you know, for the lesson, for the way a single smile can echo across a lifetime.” She added, “Sometimes we forget that nothing we love was ever meant to be kept.”The couple shares three children—Xavier, Ella-Grace, and Hadrien. They announced their separation in August 2023 after 18 years of marriage.Trudeau, 53, has faced months of rumours linking him romantically with Katy Perry, 40, who split from actor Orlando Bloom in June.The rumours grew on Sunday after the Daily Mail shared photos of Trudeau and Perry kissing on her luxury yacht near Santa Barbara, California.“Maybe love’s deepest teaching is this—to stand open-hearted in the face of impermanence, to honour what has been and to trust that letting go is also a form of keeping inside us where no loss can erase it,” Grégoire said in the Instagram video. “That is love’s endurance. That is what carries us forward.”Trudeau and Perry were also seen together in Montreal in July, sharing a private dinner. Perry has a 5-year-old daughter, Daisy Dove Bloom, with Orlando Bloom and was previously married to comedian Russell Brand.Sources told the Daily Mail that the singer is “very, very interested in him. She says he's a real catch, a high-quality guy. She clearly likes him a lot. He likes her a lot.”Trudeau has not publicly commented on the relationship.

Told students I was more likely to be elected Pope than win Nobel: Mokyr





Stockholm: Three researchers who probed the process of business innovation won the Nobel Prize in economics Monday for explaining how new products and inventions promote economic growth and human welfare, even as they leave older companies in the dust. Their work was credited with helping economists better understand how ideas and technology succeed by disrupting established ways - a process as old as steam locomotives replacing horse-drawn wagons and as contemporary as e-commerce shuttering shopping malls.Joel Mokyr, 79, is at Northwestern University; Philippe Aghion, 69, works at College de France and London School of Economics; and Peter Howitt, 79, is at Brown University.The winners were credited with better explaining and quantifying ""creative destruction"", a key concept in economics that refers to the process in which beneficial new innovations replace - and thus destroy - older technologies and businesses. Examples of creative destruction include e-commerce disrupting retail, streaming services replacing videocassette and DVD rentals and internet advertising undermining newspaper advertising.agenciesThe concept is usually associated with economist Joseph Schumpeter, who outlined it in his 1942 book 'Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy'. Schumpeter called the concept ""the essential fact about capitalism"". The Nobel committee said Mokyr ""demonstrated that if innovations are to succeed one another in a self-generating process, we not only need to know that something works, but we also need to have scientific explanations for why"".Aghion and Howitt studied the mechanisms behind sustained growth, including in a 1992 article that offered a complex mathematical model for creative destruction that added new aspects not included in earlier models. ""The laureates' work shows that economic growth cannot be taken for granted. We must uphold the mechanisms that underlie creative destruction, so that we do not fall back into stagnation,"" said John Hassler, chair of the committee for the prize in economic sciences.Mokyr has long been known as an optimist about recent technological innovation. About a decade ago, many economists argued that inventions such as smartphones or even the internet had less of an economic impact than previous developments such as the airplane or the car. Mokyr responded that as new services were either cheap or free, their impact wasn't evident in economic data, but they provided enormous benefits.Mokyr said he was shocked to win the prize. "" I had no clue that anything like this was going to happen,"" he said. His students had asked him about the possibility he would win the Nobel, he said. ""I told them that I was more likely to be elected Pope than to win the Nobel prize in economics.""","Joel mokyr, philippe aghion and peter howitt won the nobel prize in economics.

From Flat Lines to Hockey Sticks



Mokyr: The Marriage of “Know-How” and “Know-Why”



Aghion & Howitt: Growth Through Creative Destruction



Why It Matters



eight





“We’re a planet of six billion ninnies living in a civilisation built by a few thousand savants,” Scott Adams once said — and beneath thecreator's misanthropy is a disarmingly accurate description of how the modern world works. Most of us don’t invent, build, or discover anything of world-changing importance. We live inside systems we didn’t design, using tools we don’t understand, and benefitting daily from the work of people whose names we’ll never know. And yet, we’re quick to criticise those same systems — science, technology, capitalism — that lifted us from the brink of subsistence to a level of prosperity our ancestors couldn’t imagine.It’s precisely this paradox that the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences asks us to confront. It’s also the most controversial of the Nobel family because, strictly speaking, it isn’t a Nobel at all. Alfred Nobel never mentioned economics in his will; the prize was added in 1968 by Sweden’s central bank — a late addition to the family tree. Think of it as Cousin Greg from Succession: the awkward relative who wasn’t invited to dinner but now shows up every Christmas and insists he’s always been part of the family.And yet, this gate-crashing prize may be the most consequential of them all, because economics isn’t just about money. It’s about the deep, often invisible mechanisms that explain how human civilisation stopped crawling and started sprinting.For most of recorded history, humanity went nowhere fast. A peasant in medieval Europe lived much the same life as a farmer in ancient Mesopotamia. Empires rose and fell, plagues came and went, and the occasional invention — a plough here, a printing press there — might briefly improve life. But those improvements rarely built on one another. Progress was sporadic and short-lived. The line of human prosperity was basically flat.Then, about two centuries ago, everything changed. Wealth began to grow exponentially. Populations soared. Cities expanded. Medicine worked. Steam, electricity, combustion and, eventually, computing transformed every corner of life. And instead of slowing down, progress began to accelerate. The question is: why?This year’s Nobel laureates — Joel Mokyr, Philippe Aghion, and Peter Howitt — offer complementary answers to that question. Together, their work explains why humanity’s growth engine roared to life — and what keeps it running today.Joel Mokyr, an economic historian, argues that the Industrial Revolution wasn’t just about machines — it was about knowledge. Before the 18th century, most human innovation was based on know-how: practical skills, techniques, and tricks. People knew how to do things but not why they worked. Without that deeper understanding, invention couldn’t build on itself. Progress happened in bursts but couldn’t compound.The Enlightenment changed that. Science and technology stopped being separate worlds and started reinforcing each other. Scientific discoveries explained why things worked, which allowed engineers to design better tools and machines. Those tools, in turn, raised new scientific questions. Mokyr calls this cycle “useful knowledge” — a feedback loop between theory and practice that transformed invention from a series of lucky accidents into a self-sustaining system.But knowledge alone wasn’t enough. It needed skilled people to turn ideas into reality — artisans, mechanics, and engineers — and it needed societies willing to embrace disruption. Britain was uniquely placed for this. It had a pool of skilled craftsmen and institutions flexible enough to allow new industries to rise, even when they destroyed old ones. Where older systems punished change, Britain began to reward it — and progress exploded.If Mokyr explains how growth begins, Philippe Aghion and Peter Howitt explain how it continues. Their core idea is creative destruction — Joseph Schumpeter’s famous term for capitalism’s brutal but productive cycle. In a dynamic economy, new technologies don’t complement the old; they replace them. A company invents a better product, dethrones the market leader, and is itself dethroned by the next innovator. Industries collapse, jobs disappear, and new ones emerge.Beneath the smooth line of GDP growth lies this constant churn — a storm of destruction that fuels creation. It’s not a flaw; it’s the engine. The promise of profit drives firms to innovate, knowing they’ll eventually be replaced. The fear of obsolescence drives them to run faster. And the result is relentless progress.Creative destruction is not without pain. It produces winners and losers. It can move too quickly — wasting resources on marginal improvements — or too slowly, when monopolies choke competition. But without it, economies stagnate. Aghion and Howitt’s work helps explain how societies can manage that balance: encouraging innovation without letting it spiral out of control.The core lesson from this year’s Nobel is deceptively simple: sustained prosperity isn’t natural. It’s engineered. It depends on the marriage of science and technology, on societies that embrace change rather than fear it, and on markets that reward innovation while punishing complacency. It’s why we complain about slow Wi-Fi instead of famine. It’s why we debate the ethics of artificial intelligence instead of the inevitability of plague. And it’s why most of us have never known the grinding poverty, insecurity, and vulnerability that were once the default condition of human life.Yet this system is fragile. It can be undone by monopolies, political short-sightedness, or cultural resistance to change. It can be slowed by hostility to science, censorship, or the temptation to cling to the familiar. If that happens, the line flattens again. Stagnation returns. And the miracle of modernity — the miracle we take for granted — begins to fade.Scott Adams was right: civilisation is the work of a few thousand savants. But those savants are not lone geniuses; they are products of a system built over centuries — a system that turns knowledge into invention, invention into industry, and industry into prosperity. Our job is not to sneer at it but to sustain it. Because Cousin Greg, for all his awkwardness, is the reason we’re here. And without him — without economics — the story of howplus billion ninnies ended up living in a civilisation of unimaginable abundance would make no sense at all.","Joel mokyr, an economic historian, argues that the industrial revolution wasn’t just about machines — it was about knowledge.

The rise of fast furniture

Forests under pressure

Gen Z's secondhand surge





Every item of furniture in Daniel Santos' Berlin apartment comes with a story. There's the desk that took him deep into the city's former Soviet suburbs, the bed frame he hauled with the help of five housemates, and the nearly century-old dresser he brought back to life with glue and nails.Santos says it's ""crazy"" to think the pale-yellow antique he bought from a grandson parting with his family's heirlooms ""has survived until now.""""Actually a few days ago, I sent him pictures of it in my room, and he was happy to see that it was living on,"" he said.Santos is part of a younger generation of decor scavengers, increasingly aware of furniture's massive carbon footprint and therefore happy to shop secondhand. They don't want to buy things that will be dumped a little further down the line.Globally, researchers estimate at least 51 million tons of furniture are consumed every year with more than 95% of it discarded. That high buy-to-landfill ratio is partially a consequence of ""fast furniture,"" a cousin of""fast fashion"" — cheap, mass-produced home decor designed for convenience rather than durability.On the rise in recent years, fast furniture's ever-changing styles encourage people to toss furnishings before the end of their natural lifecycle.One study found that British consumers redecorate their homes every one to five years. In a push to ""to stay in style, they turn to inexpensive and disposable furniture that can easily be replaced when their decor changes,"" the authors wrote.And items are often not made to be recyclable. A single sofa might contain textiles, plastic-based foams, plywood, cardboard and metal springs — all fused with laminates, resin and glues — which makes them very hard to separate and repurpose.In the United States alone, 12.1 million tons of furniture waste was generated in 2018 with less than 0.5% of it recycled. That's an almost sixfold increase over 1960 levels.Chicago furniture designer CoCo Ree Lemery says the explosion in fast furniture is partially driven by cheap new materials.IKEA's ubiquitous Billy bookcase is a case in point. When it first appeared in the IKEA catalog in 1979, it was made with a wood veneer finish. Since then, it has been redesigned with contact paper, making it cheaper than the original but harder to repair. Today, the company claims to sell a new Billy bookcase every five seconds.Lemery says the influence of fast-fashion brands on home decor design has been another key factor pushing the uptake of cheap furniture.Spanish fast-fashion giant Zara launched its home division in 2003, followed by Swedish rival H&M in 2009. They both helped normalize quick-turn seasonal trends such as rustic wood tables for fall or velvet chairs for winter in home goods stores.Buying trends shows a greater emphasis on cheap, trendy furniture, Lemery said. ""So, a lot of designers and manufacturers and large companies are in fact following that data, despite it not being good for the long run.""As demand for cheap furniture has increased, it's placed pressure on the supply chain and resources.IKEA is one of the world's largest consumers of wood, using about 0.5% of the total amount harvested for industrial purposes each year, the company said.Environmental group Greenpeace has accused the company of felling ancient forests in areas of Romania's Carpathian Mountains that it says should be protected for their high biodiversity value.The furniture giant told DW it had reviewed the Greenpeace report and could confirm that ""the wood used in IKEA products from these forests fully complies with applicable laws."" And with standards set by the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) — a global nonprofit that certifies timber production.""Wood from protected old-growth forests is strictly prohibited in our supply chain,"" a spokesperson for the company said. ""Nevertheless, we have asked FSC Romania to consider the potential need for further protection following our review.""Flat-pack giants and fast-fashion retailers may be losing sway with first-time furniture buyers.According to research from e-commerce comparison website Capital One Shopping, over a billion people visit the Facebook Marketplace digital classified service every month. An estimated 491 million buy something there. Meanwhile, a trend report from social media platform Pinterest recently said searches for ""secondhand kitchens"" have skyrocketed by 1,012% and ""secondhand decor"" by 283%, with Gen Z users making up half of the site's base.Deana McDonagh, professor of industrial design at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, says younger consumers are turning to secondhand shopping for a number of reasons: sustainability, frequent moves, tight budgets, limited transport, and also the emotional connection they form with an acquired piece.""With this old furniture, these old chairs, you have to invest in refreshing it,"" McDonagh said, which draws it into a person's story.Santos can relate to that, insisting he wouldn't dream of dumping the dresser he fixed up.Sustainability advocates say reuse is one of the clearest antidotes to fast furniture's environmental toll.""The more that you can source inside your bubble, the better off you're making the world,"" Lemery said","""fast furniture"" is cheap, mass-produced home decor designed for convenience rather than durability. A single sofa might contain textiles, plastic-based foams, plywood, cardboard and metal springs. Ikea is one of the world's largest consumers of wood, using about 0.5% of the total amount harvested.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124508005,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-39612,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

BRUSSELS: The EU Friday demanded digital giants including Snapchat and YouTube explain how they are protecting children from online harm, as all but two member states signalled openness to restricting social media access for minors.The European Union has stringent rules regulating the digital space, including what children should be able to see, but there is increasing concern that more needs to be done. Inspired by Australia’s social media ban for under-16s, Brussels is analysing whether to set bloc-wide limits on minors’ access to platforms — with 25 of 27 EU countries coming out Friday in support of at least studying such a measure.Europe’s biggest weapon for ensuring platforms tackle illegal content and keep children safe online is the Digital Services Act, which has sparked censorship claims from the US tech sector and retaliation threats from President Donald Trump.Now, as part of “investigative actions” under the DSA, the European Commission has sent a request for information to Snapchat about what steps it is taking to prevent access for children under 13.The commission has also asked Apple ’s App Store and the Google Play marketplace to provide details on measures taken to prevent children downloading illegal or harmful apps — for example, those with gambling services or sexual content.",Eu demands digital giants including snapchat and youtube explain how they are protecting children from online harm.
