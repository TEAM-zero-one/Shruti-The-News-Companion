Astronomer's reputation takes a hit







Pete Dejoy, the interim CEO of Astronomer, did not bury his head on the scandal as he took charge of his new role and instead put out a statement on LinkedIn. Dejoy said the media attention to their startup because of the viral video has been unusual and surreal. Astronomer is now a household name, he said adding that he would never wish for it to happen like this.""At Astronomer we have never shied away from challenges; a near-decade of building this business has tested us time and time again, and each time we’ve emerged stronger.

Though the company issued a statement denying the presence of any other person apart from the former CEO and the HR chief, many former employees spoke out anonymously about the toxic work culture of the startup.While Andy Byron resigned amid the controversy, Astronomer's silence over Kristin Cabot, the HR head who was there with Andy, has been questioned.

“Get paid soon”: CeeDee Lamb pressures Jerry Jones as $45M Micah Parsons standoff shakes Cowboys camp,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/get-paid-soon-ceedee-lamb-pressures-jerry-jones-as-45m-micah-parsons-standoff-shakes-cowboys-camp/articleshow/122871126.cms,"CeeDee Lamb backs Micah Parsons $45M payday (Image credits: IG/X)

CeeDee puts heat on Jerry Jones as locker room rallies behind Parsons

Micah reports to camp, but contract clock still ticking

Market pressure mounts on Cowboys

FAQs

Q1. What is Micah Parsons’ contract status?

Q2. What are his career highlights so far?

Q3. How much could Parsons earn on his next deal?

Micah Parsons remains unsigned as the Cowboys enter training camp, and now one of the team’s biggest stars is breaking silence. Wide receiver CeeDee Lamb has stepped in, sending a clear signal to Jerry Jones and the Dallas front office — it’s time to pay up. With public pressure rising and the locker room watching, Lamb’s voice may just tilt the scales in this high-stakes contract standoff.For the first time since talks stalled, Lamb openly addressed the tension around Parsons’ extension. Speaking candidly, he remarked, “Playing this media game with Jerry [Jones] is not the best. It’s not fun. It’s not recommended.”His remarks add urgency inside the locker room, where players are rallying around Parsons as camp heats up. Lamb’s tone wasn’t confrontational — it was calculated. And it emphasized just how important Parsons is to the team’s long-term plans.Despite reporting to camp in Oxnard, Parsons is taking part in limited on-field activity while contract talks remain frozen. On Tuesday, he confirmed that there’s “not really much movement” on the deal — and that his attendance is for himself and his teammates, not a tactic.The 25-year-old linebacker added pointedly: “They sign the checks… let’s see if they want me to be here at the end of the day.”The message is clear: he’s ready to deliver, but not at a discount.Across the league, defensive stars are getting paid. With Myles Garrett, T.J. Watt, and Nick Bosa all earning deals in the $30–40 million range, analysts expect Parsons — a two-time First-Team All-Pro — to command at least $45 million annually.Lamb, fully aware of Parsons’ worth, reinforced the call: “Micah knows what he brings to the table… he should get what he deserves. I do want Micah to get paid, soon.” With media scrutiny intensifying and fan frustration boiling online, the Cowboys are walking a tightrope — and Lamb just turned up the heat on Jones to close the deal.Also read: Chris Broussard slams Jerry Jones as Micah Parsons’ $40M NFL contract talks stall Parsons is playing on his fifth-year rookie option worth around $24 million.

ESPN set to acquire NFL RedZone and NFL Network in $2 billion deal

Scott Hanson confirms NFL RedZone return amid ESPN takeover talks

“There was quite a knockdown drag‑out negotiation, but I’m thrilled to be back.”

ESPN is close to making a huge move. According to The New York Times via social media on July 23, 2025, ESPN is aiming to buy NFL RedZone and NFL Network in a deal worth over $2 billion. The news came out today and it’s a big surprise. So far, ESPN and the NFL have not officially said it’s done. But insiders say talks are very serious.On July 22 and 23, sources from Front Office Sports, The Athletic, and BroBible said that ESPN and NFL owners are ready to vote soon. They say the deal feels like it’s “inside the five‑yard line,” meaning almost done.The plan is for NFL owners to possibly vote in early August. If they say yes, ESPN would take control of NFL Network, the NFL RedZone show, and even some regular‑season games that aired on the NFL’s own channel.The NFL might also get some ownership in ESPN in exchange, creating a deeper partnership with Disney, ESPN’s parent company.Scott Hanson, who has hosted NFL RedZone since 2009, renewed his contract for another season with NFL Network in May 2025. He faced tough talks, calling them “knock‑down, drag‑out negotiations” and admitted he almost left for NBC’s Olympic coverage. But he’s back, and RedZone returns on Sunday, September 7, 2025.Also Read: ESPN viewership soars as it targets $2B NFL media deal and major streaming debut Hanson said on SI Media Podcast:The Athletic’s Andrew Marchand said on July 23 that the deal would be “enormous,” valued at around $2 billion.

Why I left VShojo

Trust and Transparency in VTubing

What's Next for VShojo?



On 21st July, Ironmouse in the VShojo-originals line announced to the world that she had terminated her agency contract through the YouTube channel, in an uneasy style. The video, titled ""Why I Left VShojo,"" was not just a farewell statement. It was also an accusation. Ironmouse claimed in the video that the agency had not only withheld her own paychecks but had also withheld charity fundraising amounts of over $500,000, intended for IDF, the Immune Deficiency Foundation.It was a turning point for many fans in what had, until that day, seemed a model partnership between one of the Internet's most beloved creators and a talent agency that helped give the VTubers mainstream visibility. Yet, the fissures had apparently been forming months ago.Before the video was released, there were already some quiet alarms raised by Ironmouse. On July 17, Ironmouse shared a cryptic update on social media saying, I'm so sorry for not streaming as much these past two weeks. I have been going through a lot…”Four days later, when the video was released, fans put two and two together. Her recent absence was not just due to health issues and Ironmouse has been pretty open about living with Common Variable Immunodeficiency, she said-but due to mounting frustrations against VShojo over alleged money wrongdoing.The Ironmouse video acted as somewhat of a breaking point. On that same day, a whole wave of allegations started pouring in on behalf of other creators and collaborators. An artist known as @vortoxy stepped out his silence and gave his account on X, alleging it took VShojo two months to pay $500 for a commission, suggesting he felt he would have been forgotten if he had not persistently followed up.Following this, Ironmouse's composer for music came out, stating the company had turned a deaf ear to invoices amounting to ""thousands of dollars."" These accounts-range in severity-paint a larger picture: Maybe VShojo has a systemic financial issue.Certainly, this controversy goes much deeper than just one fallout between a creator and an agency. A Western agency first-ever to bestow VTubers with an influencing platform and professional infrastructure, VShojo always stood at the apex. Ironmouse was not just a client but also a co-founder and the very heart of the agency brand.These charity misappropriation claims are just the worst to handle. The IDF, an organization that aids those with immunodeficiencies like Ironmouse herself, was supposed to benefit from donations raised through campaigns directly promoted by her. If this is found to be true, this betrayal just goes deeper than money, it is about values.As things stand, VShojo has still not made a full-fledged public response to the money accusations. The agencies have reportedly been asking for their side of the story from various media outlets as well as the IDF, but nothing has yet come back.The VTubing community established for the longest time upon social bonds and creator trust is now watching. For VShojo, the road ahead is going to require a lot more than just legal closure, it is going to require transparency, accountability, and a genuine bid to repair the fractured relationship with fans and talent alike.","Ironmouse in the vshojo-originals line announced to the world that she had terminated her agency contract through the youtube channel, in an uneasy style.

Deep Field Games ' acclaimed survival crafting title Abiotic Factor made its PlayStation 5 debut yesterday as a day-one addition to PlayStation Plus Extra and Premium tiers. The six-player cooperative game, which earned overwhelmingly positive reviews during its Steam Early Access phase, throws players into an underground research facility overrun by alien threats and military crusaders.Players must use scientific ingenuity rather than brute force to survive, crafting equipment from salvaged office supplies, alien artifacts, and destroyed computer parts. The game supports online multiplayer for up to six friends, allowing teams to tackle specialized roles including forager, fighter, chef, builder, or explorer as they navigate the sprawling GATE Cascade Research Facility .Abiotic Factor maintains a 4.62-star rating on PlayStation Store based on hundreds of user reviews, mirroring its Steam success where it achieved 94.38% positive feedback over 12 months. Players have praised the game's unique blend of Half-Life, Grounded, and SCP elements, creating what reviewers describe as an immersive survival horror experience with flexible base-building mechanics.The title joins an exceptionally strong July PlayStation Plus lineup that includes Cyberpunk 2077 , Diablo IV , and Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden, marking one of the service's most robust monthly offerings in 2025.The PlayStation launch coincides with Abiotic Factor's simultaneous release on Xbox Series X/S and Game Pass, representing the New Zealand developer's push toward broader console accessibility. While Sony typically doesn't disclose retention periods for PlayStation Plus titles, industry trends suggest the game will likely remain available for at least 12 months.Players interested in the title should act quickly to claim other July bonuses, as PlayStation Plus members have until today to secure a 30% discount on Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty expansion, originally introduced when the base game joined the service earlier this month.","Abiotic factor's strong critical reception follows console launch.

Read Bill Gates complete LinkedIn post here



I’ve entered the startup world again…

When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes.

I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how technology can make systems more efficient, equitable, and accessible. But I’ve learned over the years that the best way to understand how something works, or where it breaks, is to go straight to the people using it.

That’s why I’ll be joining the Phia customer experience team for a day this week. Phia is a fashion-tech tool built to make shopping smarter and more sustainable, and it’s the brainchild of my daughter Phoebe Gates and her co-founder Sophia Kianni.

They’ve built an app and browser extension that helps people shop smarter by finding the best prices, surfacing secondhand options, and showing lower-impact alternatives across thousands of online retailers.

It’s been inspiring to watch them tackle a massive challenge, rethinking the way we shop, by meeting users where they are.

And now, I’ll be doing the same.

Looking forward to getting back into the startup scene. Hopefully, I won’t break anything (no promises).

📲Download the Phia iOS app for free at join.phia.com

💻Or if you shop on your computer like me, they have a free chrome extension at gophia.com

Let me know what you think! You never know who’s on the other end of the customer service line…

Big Question Answered: Why Google is Merging Android and ChromeOS

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, recently demonstrated a unique approach to leadership and family support by working a shift in customer service for his daughter Phoebe's new startup. In a LinkedIn post Bill Gates revealed that his daughter Phoebe Gates asked him to work a shift in customer service at her AI-powered fashion startup — Phil and Gates agree to it. “I’ve entered the startup world again… When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes,” wrote Gates in a LinkedIn post.Phoebe Gates co-founded Phia along with her Stanford roommate Sophia Kianni. The platform uses AI to help users compare prices of new and second-hand products across more than 40,000 websites. A web browser/app, Phia aims to be the Booking.com of fashion, offering an instant price comparison from thousands of e-commerce sites for any item, new or used. Phoebe Gates is the youngest child of Microsoft founder Bill Gates and his ex-wife, Melinda French Gates. Microsoft co-founder joined the customer service team for one day in order to understand how the product works.Bill Gates revealed that this experience reminded him that “the best way to understand how something works—or where it breaks—is to go straight to the people using it.” His stint echoes a growing trend among CEOs to spend time on the front lines, following examples like Uber CEO Dara Khosrowshahi, who famously delivered food and drove passengers to better grasp user pain points.Earlier, in April, Gates shared that he intentionally chose not to invest in his daughter’s AI-powered shopping app, Phia, during a podcast. He explained that funding the venture would have led him to oversee it too closely. Instead, he offered advice on staffing while others handled the investment.","Bill gates revealed that his daughter phoebe gates asked him to work a shift in customer service at her ai-powered fashion startup.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has shared a post on X (previously known as Twitter), suggesting a shift in his stance toward artificial intelligence . Admitting he had been “living in denial” about the technology for too long, Elon Musk wrote in the post: “I resisted AI for too long. Living in denial. Now it is game on.” Musk was replying to a post shared by an X user Mario Nawfal that quoted Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang who called Musk a ‘superhuman’.While Elon Musk has been both a vocal critic and early investor in AI, he has previously warned about the dangers of uncontrolled AI development, once calling it humanity’s “biggest existential threat.” His latest statement suggests a more aggressive pivot from caution to action.The post comes as the tech billionaire continues to expand his presence in the AI space through xAI , the startup he launched in 2023 to compete with companies like OpenAI , Google DeepMind, and Anthropic.Elon Musk’s relationship with AI has been complex. He co-founded OpenAI in 2015, but later distanced himself from the company. Over the years, he has expressed concerns about AI safety, calling for regulation and greater oversight.While Elon Musk did not elaborate on what specific moves might follow his tweet, observers say the post is likely a signal to investors, rivals, and users that he intends to take a more direct role in AI development. Notably, the tech CEO tagged three of his major companies – Tesla, SpaceX and xAI in his post.Elon Musk’s “game on” remark also hints at increasing competition in the AI sector, where companies are racing to release faster, more powerful language models and build new infrastructure to support them.In a related news, Tesla India recently shared a post on X (formerly Twitter), announcing an update on the availability of Tesla cars in the country. “Now everyone in India can order directly on our website,” the post read, adding that four cities will get priority delivery. The post was later reshared by CEO Elon Musk.","Tesla ceo elon musk has shared a post on x (previously known as twitter) admitting he had been “living in denial” about the technology for too long, elon musk wrote in the post: “i resisted ai for too.

Garena Free Fire OB50 Update FAQs

Will OB50 raise the minimum device spec?

Can Advance-Server progress carry into live servers?

Are previous Naruto Chapter 1 skins returning?

How do I report bugs post-update?

Is there any free way to get Rin?

Free Fire’s numbered updates usually tweak balance and drop a skin or two. OB50, however, lands at a turning-point moment for the game: ranked traffic is dipping, rival shooters are everywhere, and fans have begged for fresh mechanics. Garena’s answer rolls out around 31 July 2025 (after a two-week public test that opened on 11 July). Inside are a brand-new character named Rin, a follow-up to last year’s wildly popular Naruto collaboration, overhauled weapon stats, slicker menus, and at least one surprise mode aimed at streamers. Most of these features surfaced on the Advance Server, where dataminers and pro squads have already stress-tested the build. Below is a plain-language rundown of every change that matters, so you can decide whether to hoard diamonds, clear storage, or both.According to reports, early scrims show Rin pairs insanely well with Chrono and Alok: land two head-shots, pop Chrono’s shield, then beam enemies with near-zero bloom. Garena may tone her passive before global release, but if it ships intact, expect sniper-assault hybrids to dominate high-elo lobbies for at least the first week.Garena says no; any phone that ran OB49 smoothly should handle OB50, though 2 GB free storage is recommended.No. Cosmetic and level resets are total; only feedback and bug-bounty rewards remain.Leakers found no files for a re-run, so Chapter 1 cosmetics appear to stay vaulted for now.Use the new in-game “Bug Center” button under settings; logs auto-attach, and accepted critical reports pay 1,000 diamonds.Garena usually adds a milestone login campaign two weeks after launch—log seven days straight, collect tokens, craft a voucher that can be used in the Diamond Royale for a shot at Rin without spending real money.","Garena free fire ob50 update lands at a turning-point moment for the game.

"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang says: 'If I were 20 years old today, I would focus more on this field than software'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-says-if-i-were-20-years-old-today-i-would-focus-more-on-this-field-than-software/articleshow/122776861.cms,"Jensen Huang's evolving view: from engineering to physical AI

The rise of physical AI and the future of robotics

During a recent visit to Beijing, Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang was asked what he would study if he were a 20-year-old graduate in 2025. His answer was clear: he’d choose a different academic direction than the one that launched his own career. Though he didn’t explicitly name a single subject, Huang emphasized that he would lean more toward the physical sciences rather than software. This subtle but significant shift points to his evolving view of where the next wave of opportunity lies. His response reflects a broader vision for the future of artificial intelligence—one rooted not just in code, but in physics, robotics , and the mechanics of the real world that AI must increasingly learn to navigate and reason through.Jensen Huang, who earned his electrical engineering degree from Oregon State University and a master’s from Stanford, co-founded Nvidia in 1993. Today, the company sits at the forefront of the AI revolution and recently hit a historic $4 trillion market cap. While reflecting on his own path, Huang revealed he had graduated from college at age 20 and, if given the chance again, would pursue physical sciences, fields that deal with non-living systems like physics, chemistry, and astronomy.Although he didn’t go into specifics about why, Huang’s broader remarks provide insight. Over the years, AI has evolved from “Perception AI,” which focused on recognition tasks like image detection, to “Generative AI,” which includes language models capable of translating, coding, and creating. But the next chapter, according to Huang, is “Reasoning AI,” systems that can understand context, solve novel problems, and act as “agentic AI” or digital robots with reasoning power. Huang’s remarks hint at a future where AI is not just software-driven but deeply embedded in the physical world. This shift could redefine education paths for aspiring technologists, with physics and engineering regaining center stage. It’s no longer just about writing better code; it’s about building machines that think, move, and adapt. And for Huang, the future of AI might look less like a screen and more like a robot with a brain.Looking ahead, Huang predicts the rise of “Physical AI,” where artificial intelligence must grasp real-world physics: friction, inertia, cause and effect. These capabilities go beyond generating text or images—they involve anticipating how objects move, how to grip items with the right force, or how to infer the presence of hidden obstacles like a pedestrian behind a car.When AI gains this kind of physical reasoning and is embedded into machines, it leads to robotics, a critical component of Huang’s vision. With global labor shortages and the rapid expansion of manufacturing facilities, especially across the United States, Huang sees robotics powered by physical AI as essential. “Hopefully, in the next 10 years... they’re highly robotic and helping us deal with the severe labor shortage,” he said, underscoring the need for innovation that bridges the digital and physical worlds.","Jensen huang predicts the rise of “physical ai,” where artificial intelligence must grasp real-world physics.

From academic frustration to AI revolution: the birth of Perplexity



Scaling AI for the masses while rewriting the rules of search

New features rolled out rapidly:

Staying independent in the age of AI giants

In the rapidly evolving world of artificial intelligence, few stories stand out quite like that of Aravind Srinivas . In just under three years, he helped build Perplexity AI from an idea into one of the most talked-about startups in the tech ecosystem. As of July 2025, the company’s valuation had soared to $18 billion, driven by a series of breakthrough innovations and strategic partnerships, including a major deal with Bharti Airtel. That collaboration is set to give over 360 million Indian users free access to Perplexity Pro, drastically increasing the platform’s reach and cementing its global presence. Behind this remarkable ascent is the vision of a young man who channeled his mother’s dream into an empire and redefined how the world interacts with information.Aravind Srinivas was born on June 7, 1994, in Chennai (formerly Madras), Tamil Nadu. His earliest influence wasn’t a coding bootcamp or a Silicon Valley pitch deck, but his own mother. Each time they passed by the gates of IIT Madras , she would point and tell him, “You will study there one day.” That quiet repetition evolved into a shared dream—hers of opportunity, and his of purpose.Academically gifted from a young age, Aravind’s achievements spoke volumes. He secured the National Talent Search Scholarship and earned a merit certificate in the Indian National Mathematical Olympiad. These recognitions were more than just medals; they were stepping stones to IIT Madras, where he graduated in 2017 with dual degrees in Electrical Engineering.Ironically, despite his growing interest in computer science and machine learning, Aravind couldn't switch to a CS major due to a marginally lower GPA. But that didn’t stop him. He taught himself Python, followed online AI courses, competed on Kaggle, and gained mentorship under Professor Balaraman Ravindran, a pivotal figure in his intellectual development. A brief internship under AI legend Yoshua Bengio further ignited his academic trajectory, eventually leading him to a PhD at UC Berkeley, specializing in machine learning and artificial intelligence.While pursuing his PhD, Aravind began to question the limitations of traditional search engines. Why were users still forced to dig through pages of links when machines were already capable of nuanced understanding and delivering direct answers? That dissatisfaction gave birth to a radical idea: a conversational answer engine powered by large language models (LLMs) that could provide real-time, cited, and context-aware responses.In August 2022, alongside Denis Yarats, Johnny Ho, and Andy Konwinski, Aravind co-founded Perplexity AI in San Francisco. The team combined their technical expertise with a shared vision for transparent, user-friendly, AI-driven search.Their approach was novel. They prioritized trust, transparency, and clarity, avoiding the opaque algorithms of legacy platforms. By April 2024, Perplexity had raised $165 million, achieving unicorn status with a valuation of $1 billion. Just a year later, the firm reached $14 billion, and by July 2025, another $100 million funding round pushed its value to $18 billion, making it one of the fastest-growing AI companies in history.What truly set Perplexity apart was its ability to grow both in technology and scale without compromising its core vision. In May 2025, Aravind’s team signed a groundbreaking partnership with Bharti Airtel, bringing Perplexity Pro to 360 million Indian users via the Airtel Thanks app.Perplexity Pro now offers access to top-tier AI models like GPT‑4.1, Claude, image generation, and their newly launched AI browser, Comet, which handles complex web tasks via voice or text. Monthly search queries surged past 780 million, with more than 30 million active users, and an astonishing 20 percent month-on-month growth rate. Revenue, which stood at $35 million in 2024, was projected to cross an annualized $150 million by mid-2025.enterprise offerings, publisher revenue-sharing models, and real-time knowledge tools that go beyond what traditional search ever aimed for. The launch of Comet, a voice-first AI browser capable of summarizing posts, shopping, or composing emails, has redefined user expectations of online assistance.In an industry dominated by trillion-dollar tech giants, staying independent is no easy feat. Aravind Srinivas has already turned down acquisition interest from major players like Apple and Meta, signaling that Perplexity intends to build its own destiny. The company is laying the groundwork for a future public offering, likely after 2028, while expanding its presence across mobile, enterprise, and global education ecosystems.Yet through all the milestones, what remains unchanged is Aravind’s clarity of vision. From his mother’s voice in a Chennai bus to leading one of the world’s most dynamic AI companies, his journey is a rare blend of family legacy, technical brilliance, and unrelenting drive.As Perplexity continues to reshape how the world accesses and understands knowledge, Aravind Srinivas stands as a symbol of the power of self-belief and how a single dream, once whispered by a mother, can echo across the digital age.","Aravind srinivas was born on june 7, 1994, in chennai (formerly madras), tamil nadu.

What does this mean?



International grads will suffer, senior American employees will face competition







The US administration is planning to bring in a new H-1B rule which will give weightage to wage level instead of the random lottery that takes place now when H-1B registration exceed the annual limit of 65,000 plus the additional 20,000 for individuals with an advanced degree from a US university. The new rule will not be applicable this year as 2026's registration quota has already been reached. US tech workers have welcomed the proposed changes as they think the changes will eliminate the possibility of U companies hiring foreign workers for posts that don't need high skills, as H-1B should be -- but they hire only to save money as they will have to pay less wage to a foreigner than a US citizen.This is the same rule that the Trump administration wanted to bring in during the last term. “USCIS will rank and select the petitions received on the basis of the highest Occupational Employment Statistics wage level that the proffered wage equals or exceeds for the relevant Standard Occupational Classification code in the area of intended employment, beginning with OES wage level IV and proceeding in descending order with OES wage levels III, II, and I. ” (The Occupational Employment and Wage Statistics program is within the Department of Labor.)""the 2021 DHS rule said.This means there will be no H-1B hiring at the entry level. Entry-level jobs will be protected for Americans.Based on the wages and expertise needed for a job, there are four levels: Entry, qualified, experienced and fully competent.The national average of entry-level salary is $83K, level 2 is $108K, level 3 is $127K and level 4 is $151K.International graduates looking for entry-level jobs in America will suffer as they will not get a chance in the proposed system. While this is good news for American graduates, the new rule has bad news for senior American leadership as the new system will bring in more high-paid mid-level H-1Bs. Startups will also suffer as they won't be able to hire cheap labor from H-1Bs.",The us administration is planning to bring in a new h-1b rule which will give weightage to wage level.

Democrat congressman Greg Casar introduces bill to ban AI-driven price; slams ‘surveillance pricing’; seeks Republican support,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/democrat-congressman-greg-casar-introduces-bill-to-ban-ai-driven-price-slams-surveillance-pricing-seeks-republican-support/articleshow/122866540.cms,"Representational image





US congressman Greg Casar has introduced a new bill to stop what he calls “AI-driven price gouging”. The bill, called the Stop AI Price Gouging and Wage Fixing Act of 2025, targets companies that use personal data to charge customers different prices for the same product, a growing trend known as surveillance pricing.Casar, a Democrat from Texas, says tech companies are going too far by spying on people’s habits and financial history. “Prices should be based on supply and demand and based on how much it costs to make and sell a thing, not based on spying on you and using your private data,"" he told NBC News.The move follows a recent federal trade commission ( FTC ) report that found companies were using users' browser history, GPS location and shopping behaviour to silently adjust prices. The practice is common in e-commerce, and often powered by artificial intelligence.The FTC study, released in January just before president Biden left office, revealed that big firms like Mastercard, JPMorgan Chase, Accenture and McKinsey were among those feeding AI systems with consumer data. FTC chair Lina Khan called the system a “black box” where users don’t even realise they’re being charged more based on hidden profiling.Casar’s bill would also prohibit companies from using AI to determine wages based on personal financial data rather than job performance.Several US states are also cracking down. New York passed a law requiring businesses to inform customers when prices are set using algorithms. California may soon follow. But Casar’s bill is the first push for a national ban.The House is about to go into recess, so the bill won’t move before September. But Casar hopes both parties can get behind it. “You don’t have to be a progressive Democrat to say these gigantic corporations in the tech world should not be spying on us and then using what they learn to put it into AI and make our life more expensive,” he said.","Us congressman greg casar has introduced a new bill to stop what he calls ‘ai-driven price gouging’ the bill, called the stop ai price gouging and wage fixing act of 2025, targets companies that use personal data to charge customers different prices for the same product.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122866910,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-64540,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

How Estonia outpaced the rest of Europe at digitalization,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/how-estonia-outpaced-the-rest-of-europe-at-digitalization/articleshow/122827125.cms,"This is an AI- generated image used for representational purposes only

Jump to the top with a 'Tiger Leap'

Reducing Europe's digital dependency





How long does it take to divorce in your country? In Estonia, the first step of the uncomfortable undertaking can be made in less than a minute — and even without the undesired spouse being present.""It takes 45 seconds to get to the point where it says submit the divorce application,"" said Luukas Ilves, until last year the Estonian government's chief information officerIlves told DW that divorce application was the last section of public administration that had yet to be digitized, which means the small Baltic state bordering Russia is probably the first fully digitized country in the world.Even in Estonia, both partners must of course consent to the procedure and be physically present in a meeting with a civil servant who formally ends the marriage. But uptake of the online service is already phenomenal, with about 60 per cent of all divorces in Estonia being initiated via the government's so-called e-divorce platform since its launch last December.""We all expect convenience, simplicity and security from digital services in the private sector. Why should government services be any different?"" said Ilves.Ilves is the author of a recent study titled ""The End of Bureaucracy,"" which he compiled in collaboration with the Friedrich-Naumann-Foundation, which is affiliated to Germany's Free Democratic Party.The report highlights the differences in digitization policy and what Germany can learn from the more advanced Estonia.Currently, about 62 per cent of Germans use digital service in administration, while Estonia has an uptake of over 90 per cent, the report said.Electronic identity verification, for example, is a major issue in the report, as 90 per cent of Estonians use national e-IDs to access government services, compared with less than 10 per cent of Germans. The reason for that is simple, Ilves said. The Estonian software is more user-friendly and provides access to both public and private sector services, including retail banking.Ilves told DW that until a few years ago, Belgium had used an e-ID technology similar to that in Germany. But it performed poorly, with only 10 per cent to 20 per cent of the population using it.But ever since the country's banks and telecommunication operators introduced a user-friendly mobile version that allowed access to both private sector and government services, e-ID uptake has jumped to 80 per cent.Greater acceptance of digital administration services also helps save taxpayers' money, the Ilves report states. The administrative cost of collecting taxes in Estonia, for example, are per capita only one-sixth of those in Germany.Following general elections in February, the new German government of Chancellor Friedrich Merz has established a Ministry for Digital Transformation and Government Modernisation (BMDS). Its aim is to offer a ""comprehensive range of services to provide impetus, initiate cooperation and develop solutions for the public administration of the future.""Digital industry representatives like Magdalena Zadara have welcomed the decision. Zadara is chief of staff and strategy at the German Digital Service, a government agency that develops and implements software to digitalize administrative processes.Speaking with DW, she said she was ""optimistic"" about the new digital ministry because it seeks to digitalize services ""end-to-end,"" thereby cutting short the seemingly endless journeys through German bureaucracy.""If I wanted to come to Germany to work from a country outside the EU, I would have to interact with about five to seven different government agencies to get my diploma approved, and they would maybe even ask for the same data.""One solution to the problem she has in mind is Estonia's so-called once-only principle (OOP), meaning that citizens and businesses only need to provide information to public authorities once. That data can then be reused and shared internally by all authorities.OOP is one of the pillars of digital government in Estonia and even codified in law.Another hallmark of Estonia's modern administration is the digital signature, which is widely used to sign documents like employment contracts.Estonian-Russian businessman Kirill Solovjov said he first used the electronic signature when he received a so-called Estonian e-Residency in 2015 — an 11-year-old government-issued digital identity which gives global entrepreneurs remote access to the country's administrative services.""Digital signatures also existed in Russia at the time, but I was never able to go through the verification process. In Estonia, you just get the [e-ID] card, plug it in, and it works — it's magic,"" he told DW.The Baltic states — Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania — regained their independence from the former Soviet Union in 1991.The first thing Estonia did at the time was bring the internet and computers to all of its classrooms and libraries under an education program called Tiger Leap.In the year 2000, the country of 1.4 million people made another big leap in digitalization when online tax declarations became available and electronic signatures were recognized as legally equivalent to ink signatures.By 2015, all major public services including health and social services had been fully digitized.Solovjov said his favorite of all the new services is digital prescriptions. Once a doctor prescribes a medicine, he explains, it automatically ends up in the online registry, and can be accessed from any pharmacy in Estonia — and now even from neighboring Finland.""You just pull out your ID card ... the pharmacist sees exactly what has been prescribed and the different options you have. There's no deciphering illegible handwriting that's so common with doctors. It's easy, safe and fast — plus there's no tampering,"" he said.Online security is still a major concern for lawmakers in other European countries and the EU Commission in Brussels.This is why the European tech industry has been calling on lawmakers to reduce Europe's reliance on American tech giants such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon. They warned the EU Commission against watering down the bloc's Digital Markets Act as a safeguard against their dominance.Moreover, they are pushing for developing a so-called EuroStack as a European alternative for technological sovereignty because currently 80 per cent of the technology is imported.A ""stack"" refers to a layered architecture of interrelated technology components — hardware, software, networking protocols, and infrastructure — that together create a full digital platform. The EuroStack would include sovereign artificial intelligence, open-source ecosystems, green supercomputing, data commons and a sovereign cloud.Luukas Ilves is skeptical about the initiative and warns of the high opportunity costs of ""reinventing the wheel"" in digitalization, especially end-to-end applications.""No country can be autarkic and fully sovereign in the digital world. In Estonia, we never built an end-to-end Estonia stack but very specific applications and protocols on top of the global technology stack,"" he said.","Estonia is probably the first fully digitized country in the world, according to a new report. About 60 per cent of all divorces in estonia are initiated via the government's so-called e-divorce platform. The estonian software is more user-friendly and provides access to both public and private sector services.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122827505,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1122566,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Poll Do you believe social media plays a significant role in promoting educational achievements? Yes, definitely! Not really, it’s mostly for entertainment.





A group of Chinese students has captured global attention after successfully launching a homemade two-stage water rocket built from a simple cola bottle. The launch, powered by water pressure, shows the rocket soaring into the sky, separating mid-air, and deploying a parachute for a safe landing. A video of the launch has gone viral, drawing widespread admiration for the students’ creativity, teamwork, and technical skills.The video was shared on X by user Tansu Yegen with the caption, “In China, students made a two-stage rocket using a cola bottle and water pressure.Since being posted, the clip has garnered over 1.2 million views.Using basic materials like plastic bottles and water, the students engineered a rocket based on air and water pressure principles. In the launch, the first stage propelled the rocket upward using pressurized water.At a certain altitude, the second stage separated and continued its ascent using stored pressure. A parachute then deployed, allowing the rocket to descend safely, demonstrating complex physics concepts such as Newton’s laws of motion, air resistance, and pressure.Social media users, particularly from India, flooded the comments with praise and introspection.One user wrote, “And we are still struggling with basic education and basic necessities for our citizens,” while another said, “Aur hamare yaha ke bacche..”A retired engineering teacher added to the discussion, saying, “I’ve probably seen 5,000 water rocket launches in the past 25 years. This is very cool, nice two-stage with successful deployment of a parachute. The parachutes are quite tricky.”","Chinese students built a two-stage water rocket using a cola bottle and water pressure.
