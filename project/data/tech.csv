Josh Allen lists California home and invests in long-term life in Buffalo

Josh Allen parts ways with Nike and makes a surprise switch to New Balance

Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen is entering the 2025 NFL season with more than just renewed focus on the gridiron—he’s also making sweeping lifestyle and brand decisions that reflect a deeper transformation both personally and professionally.In a move that marks a turning point, Josh Allen has officially listed his Dana Point, California home for $8.5 million. The sleek $7.2 million property, purchased in 2023, once symbolized a West Coast future, with four bedrooms, three bathrooms, and lush greenery that hinted at dreams of a future family retreat. But those plans appear to have shifted.Instead, Allen is anchoring himself in Orchard Park, New York—just minutes from Highmark Stadium. There, he’s developing a sprawling estate complete with a private lake, sports court, and a full gym. The relocation also aligns with his deepening relationship with actress Hailee Steinfeld , whom he married earlier in 2025. Insiders say Allen is now spending more time at Steinfeld’s Encino estate while building his forever home in Buffalo.Equally surprising is Allen’s quiet yet powerful break from Nike. Known for his collaborations with the sportswear giant since entering the NFL in 2018, Allen was spotted at minicamp sporting silver-metallic New Balance Prodigy cleats—noticeably free of the Swoosh logo. It’s a significant shift that goes beyond fashion.Allen had previously championed Nike exclusives, including retro Deion Sanders editions and high-profile releases like the “Grinch” cleats. His new cleat choice, priced at $170, is more than a stylistic change—it’s a strategic pivot that mirrors his own journey from underestimated prospect to NFL MVP.This brand transition could mark a new chapter for both Allen and New Balance. For Nike, the departure of one of its most prominent NFL faces is notable. Allen’s work with the brand also included philanthropic efforts like directing $100,000 to Oishei Children’s Hospital. Whether such charitable ventures continue under his new brand remains to be seen.Financially, Allen is already a powerhouse. His six-year, $330 million contract—with $250 million guaranteed—cements him as the league’s highest-paid quarterback. But he’s also building a diversified empire, with investments in CorePower Yoga, Skydance Sports, and even pistachio farming—an industry expected to earn him $6.5 million annually.Also Read: Did Hailee Steinfeld distract Josh Allen from football?

What Is “Stop Killing Games”?

Pirate’s Response Adds Fuel

“I hope your initiative gets everything that you asked for, but nothing you wanted,”

A Moment Bigger Than One Creator

Popular game developer and YouTube creator Pirate Software has lost over 100,000 subscribers in just two weeks. The steep decline comes in the wake of growing outrage over his perceived opposition to the Stop Killing Games (SKG) movement, a campaign advocating against companies shutting down online games players have paid for.The sharp drop began in late June 2025. That’s when Ross Scott, the creator of theYouTube channel and founder of the SKG initiative, released a fiery video titled. In it, he directly called out Pirate Software (real name: Jason Thor Hall) for misrepresenting the movement in an earlier 2023 video.Scott’s message landed hard. His audience is passionate gamers who’ve rallied around the SKG cause and quickly mobilised. They felt Pirate had downplayed the campaign’s core message: preserving digital game ownership and fighting corporate shutdowns of single-player games. The internet, as expected, responded swiftly.According to data from Social Blade, Pirate Software’s channel has shed over 110,000 subscribers between June 26 and July 9. The decline peaked on June 26, with a staggering 20,000 lost in a single day. And the numbers haven’t stopped dipping since.While some creators bounce back from controversies, the pace and consistency of the losses suggest a deeper fracture between Pirate and his long-time followers.SKG is a grassroots movement aimed at preserving video games in their original, playable forms, especially in light of publishers increasingly shutting down online servers or removing titles from digital storefronts. The movement recently gained huge momentum in the EU, where it crossed 1.2 million signatures on a formal citizens’ initiative, enough to demand attention from lawmakers.During a July 4 Twitch stream, Hall addressed the backlash. His tone was defiant, even as he revealed he had been swatted and received death threats.he said. This comment further inflamed tensions with the SKG community.Critics called his statement dismissive. Supporters of SKG saw it as a hostile rejection of a campaign that has garnered global support from preservationists, developers, and gamers alike.At the heart of the backlash isn’t just a difference in opinion; it’s a clash of values. The SKG movement has come to symbolise the right to access what you’ve paid for. Pirate Software’s perceived dismissal of that ideal and of the campaign's legitimacy has struck a nerve.While Hall still commands a sizable audience, the trust has taken a serious hit. Whether he can rebuild from this or chooses to double down remains to be seen.One thing’s clear: the digital preservation fight just got a lot louder.","Popular game developer and youtube creator pirate software has lost over 100,000 subscribers in just two weeks.

Anthony Stolarz may be closing in on a massive extension with the Toronto Maple Leafs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/anthony-stolarz-may-be-closing-in-on-a-massive-extension-with-the-toronto-maple-leafs/articleshow/122370175.cms,"Anthony Stolarz may be closing in on a massive extension with the Toronto Maple Leafs (Image Via Twitter)

Anthony Stolarz’s impressive form and contract climate point to a major payday

The resurgence of Anthony Stolarz has rapidly shifted the considerations for his future. Originally signed as backup for Joseph Woll, the veteran goaltender came in and outshone expectations during the 2024–25 season. Now, the potential contract extension rumors grow louder by the day, and the loudest voices seem to be shouting that the Maple Leafs may be forced into giving him a huge contract, a signing that would greatly change their goaltending landscape for years ahead.Anthony Stolarz finished his first year in Toronto with a 21-8-3 regular-season record through 34 appearances, backed by an insanely good 0.926 save percentage and a 2.14 goals-against average. These are numbers that, for a backup, are highly exceptional and good for a starter, making him an absolute steal for $2.5 million per annum.With his current contract expiring soon, speculation of a blockbuster long-term extension is ramping up. The former NHL netminder Carter Hutton has recently shed light on the financial landscape for goaltenders of this caliber, highlighting the deals of Lankinen ($22.5 million for four years), Blackwood ($26.25 million for five years), and Vejmelka ($23.75 million for five years).These precedents can allow a deal with Stolarz in the $25–30 million range, especially with his age and injury history working against him and nudging him to choose security in a long-term deal.That said, not everyone in hockey seems ready to see Toronto commit right now. Jay Rosehill, the analyst, advised caution, saying the Maple Leafs should wait and see if Stolarz can duplicate his performance next season. With Joseph Woll starting the first year of a three-year contract averaging $3.6 million per season, any move on Stolarz will have a direct bearing on Toronto’s goaltending allocation, which could be pushed up to nearly $10 million for two netminders each year.Toronto's front office faces a familiar conundrum: reward a breakout performance or wait for long-term consistency. Stolarz, capable of stepping up to the plate after his win in the 2023-24 Stanley Cup with the Panthers, is now the question. For 32 years, the volatilities of his next contract must be carefully contemplated.Also Read: NHL rumors: Los Angeles Kings interested in Calgary Flames blue-liner Rasmus Andersson The status of Stolarz as a top performer in the Gates has created an urgency for contract discussions. Market parallels make an argument for the big extension; however, the Leafs must now decide whether they want to take the player on now or wait until he gives more proof and stake a $25–30 million gamble.","Anthony stolarz finished his first year in toronto with a 21-8-3 regular-season record through 34 appearances, backed by an insanely good 0.926 save percentage and a 2.14 goals-against average.

Jack Dorsey, co-founder of Twitter and CEO of Block, has launched Bitchat, a decentralized messaging app designed for offline communication. Unlike traditional apps that depend on Wi-Fi or mobile data, Bitchat uses Bluetooth mesh networking to connect nearby devices without internet access. This innovative approach enables users to send encrypted messages in areas with poor or no connectivity. Bitchat’s focus on privacy, peer-to-peer communication, and no data collection has quickly captured the attention of users seeking secure, internet-free messaging solutions. It represents a bold step toward more resilient and private communication in today’s increasingly connected world.Bitchat is a peer-to-peer (P2P) messaging application that operates without the need for Wi-Fi or cellular networks. By utilising Bluetooth, it enables users to send messages directly between devices nearby. This makes it an ideal tool for environments where internet access is weak, unreliable, or intentionally blocked—such as remote areas, crowded events, or emergency situations.More than just a texting app, Bitchat stands out for its focus on privacy, decentralization, and user control. No servers, accounts, or tracking mechanisms are involved.Bitchat connects nearby smartphones directly using Bluetooth mesh networking, which creates a local web of connected devices.

Twitter CEO Linda Yaccarino's 'Goodbye note'

After two incredible years, I’ve decided to step down as CEO of 𝕏. When @elonmusk and I first spoke of his vision for X, I knew it would be the opportunity of a lifetime to carry out the extraordinary mission of this company. I’m immensely grateful to him for entrusting me with the responsibility of protecting free speech, turning the company around, and transforming X into the Everything App.

I’m incredibly proud of the X team - the historic business turn around we have accomplished together has been nothing short of remarkable. We started with the critical early work necessary to prioritize the safety of our users—especially children, and to restore advertiser confidence. This team has worked relentlessly from groundbreaking innovations like Community Notes, and, soon, X Money to bringing the most iconic voices and content to the platform. Now, the best is yet to come as X enters a new chapter with @xai

X is truly a digital town square for all voices and the world’s most powerful culture signal. We couldn’t have achieved that without the support of our users, business partners, and the most innovative team in the world.

I’ll be cheering you all on as you continue to change the world.

As always, I’ll see you on 𝕏

This makes Nvidia the first public company in the world to reach the milestone and solidify its position as one of Wall Street's most-favored stocks.

Nvidia’s stock has rebounded impressively, up 74% from its April lows, when global markets faced turbulence due to U.S. President Donald Trump’s tariff announcements. The volatility rattled investors, but recent optimism surrounding potential trade deals between the U.S. and its partners has lifted market sentiment, propelling the S&P 500 to a record high.Nvidia’s dominance is underscored by its 7.3% weighting in the S&P 500, the largest of any company in the index.

The story had gained significant traction on Indian social media platforms, as affluent Indian citizens have shown keen interest in investment visas and residency programmes in recent years.Nomination-based visa schemes, despite being contentious, have become a preferred option for wealthy families worldwide seeking relocation opportunities for various reasons including taxation, quality of life, and educational prospects.The ICP (Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security) has finally dismissed claims spread across various media platforms and online sources suggesting that the UAE offers permanent Golden Visas to specific nationalities, according to a Emirates News Agency report.The Authority emphasised that Golden Visa specifications, requirements and guidelines are explicitly outlined in official regulations and government decrees. Those seeking accurate details can access this information through the Authority's official digital platforms, including their website and mobile application.The authority emphasised that legal measures would be taken against organisations disseminating inaccurate details whilst unlawfully soliciting funds from people who wish to establish residence in the UAE. Such entities take advantage of individuals' aspirations for a respectable and stable lifestyle.The possibility of obtaining a permanent visa to relocate to Dubai, a highly sought-after destination, for the cost equivalent to a mid-range SUV, appeared unrealistic, and it turns out that it was a rumour.A prominent Dubai-based golden visa consultant had confirmed to ET that UAE officials have not announced any modifications to Golden Visa regulations permitting Indian nationals to obtain a lifetime Golden Visa for AED 100,000.Speaking to ET from Dubai via telephone, Iqbal Marconi, former chief executive of ECH Group (recognised by Khaleej Times as the region's principal golden visa facilitator), mentioned receiving numerous enquiries from India following the circulation of this information.""I checked with the authorities here, and they say they have no such information. So, the news is likely to be untrue. The only new update they have is that crypto investors won't be considered for the Golden Visa scheme.”“I checked with the GDRFA (General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs Dubai) also, they too said they don't have any information on this. I also checked with a couple of officials here who are in the same line of work, they also said they don't have any information in this regard,” he added.A senior official, speaking anonymously to the financial daily, had emphasised that UAE visas are not available for purchase. The government may grant Golden Visas based on various criteria, including AED 2 million real estate investments, business ownership, and notable achievements in science, medicine, arts, culture, media, and sports.The Vision Dubai 2033 strategy aims to double the UAE economy, acknowledging population growth as essential for achieving this objective.Also read | UAE rolls out new golden visa: Lifetime residency at Rs 23 lakh, India among first to benefit","Uae's icp has dismissed claims spread across various media platforms and online sources suggesting that the uae offers permanent golden visas to specific nationalities.

"‘Not my responsibility’: California woman flooded with Amazon packages she didn't order, her address became return destination",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/not-my-responsibility-california-woman-flooded-with-amazon-packages-she-didnt-order-her-address-became-return-destination/articleshow/122370663.cms,"Image: ABC 7





A California woman has been receiving hundreds of huge Amazon packages that she never ordered after a Chinese seller called Liusandedian used her address as the return destination.Identified only as Kay, the woman has been receiving these packages for over a year. The volume has been so overwhelming that she has had to stack up these boxes in her driveway just to keep things somewhat organized. She is struggling to park her car in her property due to the sheer number of packages piled up there.Months turned to a year, but Kay did not stop receiving these packages. ""I couldn't even get my mother in the house...it's just been another form of he**,” she said, referring to her 88-year-old mother, who is disabled, as reported by ABC 7.""And every time I was absolutely assured this will stop... you won't get any more of these packages, you'll hear from us in 24, 48 hours..."" Kay said.Liusandedian appears to sell seat covers that are tailored to fit various models of Sedans and SUVs. In many cases, the covers didn’t fit, and customers said they had to pay out of pocket to send them back to the company’s so-called “return center.”Kay said Amazon has left her to deal with the problem on her own, advising her to give away the packages, donate them, or return them via USPS or FedEx. Amazon, however, disputed that claim, stating it never suggested she took the boxes to USPS or FedEx.""Why is it my responsibility to get rid of this, when your seller is not following your rules, Amazon?"" she told ABC7Amazon policy says international sellers must either give a US return address, offer a returnless refund, or provide a prepaid international return label within two days. If they don’t respond, Amazon can refund the buyer and charge the seller.Liusandedian has appeared to circumvent the policy by providing an address that was Kay’s to avoid losing all proceeds from the sale or covering the cost of shipping the item back to China.\Amazon also requires third-party sellers must list a physical address on their profile, but it doesn't have to be in the US.Instead, this has led to customers being stuck with a bill.""This is thousands of dollars they've paid to send these boxes back to my house!"" Kay said as those boxes were finally removed.","A california woman has been receiving hundreds of huge amazon packages that she never ordered after a chinese seller used her address as the return destination.
