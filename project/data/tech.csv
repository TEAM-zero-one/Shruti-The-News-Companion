Amid the ongoing debate over Tamil Nadu’s language policy, an old video of Google CEO Sundar Pichai has resurfaced online, adding fuel to the controversy. The video, which has now gone viral, features Pichai mentioning that he learned Hindi in school. A tweet accompanying the clip states: “Sundar Pichai, who comes from Chennai, Tamil Nadu, says—‘I learnt Hindi in school’. Sundar Pichai was born in 1972 and learnt Hindi during Congress rule. Clearly, Hindi was the third language in Tamil Nadu.”The resurfaced video emerges amid backlash against DMK MP Dayanidhi Maran , who claimed that Pichai studied under Tamil Nadu’s two-language policy and credited it for his success.Sundar Pichai was born into a Tamil Brahmin family. His mother, Lakshmi, worked as a stenographer, while his father, Regunatha Pichai, was an electrical engineer at British conglomerate GEC. He pursued metallurgical engineering at IIT Kharagpur, where he excelled academically, earning a silver medal and securing a scholarship to study at Stanford University.Moving to the United States, Pichai completed his MS in engineering and materials science at Stanford. He briefly worked at Applied Materials before pursuing an MBA at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, which he completed in 2002.Pichai’s career at Google began in 2004, following a short stint at consulting firm McKinsey. He initially worked in product management and development, contributing to projects like Google Toolbar and playing a key role in developing the Chrome browser.His leadership quickly gained recognition, and by 2008, he was named vice president of product development. He was promoted to senior vice president in 2012 and, by 2014, became Google's product chief, overseeing the Android operating system along with other major services. His rise within the company set the stage for his eventual leadership at Google and its parent company, Alphabet.","An old video of google ceo sundar pichai has resurfaced online, adding fuel to the controversy.

What is NHS England?

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced on Thursday that NHS England will be abolished, bringing the National Health Service (NHS) back under direct government control.“I’m bringing management of the NHS back into democratic control, by abolishing the arms-length body NHS England,” Starmer said.In a speech, he explained: ""We're going to cut bureaucracy across the state. Focus government on the priorities of working people, shift money to the front line.""He further said, ""Amongst the reasons we're abolishing it is because of the duplication. So if you can believe it, we've got a communications team in NHS England, we've got a communications team in the health department of government. We've got a strategy team in NHS England, a strategy team in the government department. We're duplicating things that could be done once. If we strip that out, which is what we're doing today, that then allows us to free up that money, to put it where it needs to be, which is the front line.""Also read: NHS England announces large-scale cuts as part of government shake-up Starmer arugued that politicians should oversee the NHS rather than an independent body. He concluded by saying this decision will return the NHS to the center of government ""where it belongs"" and added that ""tough choices"" will continue.Under these plans, NHS England will now operate within the UK government's department of health and social care.NHS England is responsible for leading the National Health Service (NHS) in England.It has various functions, including overseeing healthcare services, working with the government to set priorities and funding, and negotiating costs for medical products and services.NHS England is an executive non-departmental public body, which means it is not a government department but operates using public funds under the sponsorship of the department of health and social care.",Uk prime minister keir starmer announced on thursday that nhs england will be abolished.

In February, the vegetarian thali saw a reduction in cost compared to the previous year, whilst the non-vegetarian thali showed an increase due to higher broiler prices.

The vegetarian thali saw a 1% reduction year-on-year in February, whereas the non-vegetarian thali registered an increase of approximately 6%:

The reduction in vegetarian thali cost was attributed to decreased prices of tomato and LPG cylinder

was attributed to decreased prices of tomato and LPG cylinder Tomato prices reduced to Rs 23/kg from Rs 32/kg, showing a 28% decrease year-on-year, due to 20% increased supply

LPG costs decreased by 11% year-on-year (to Rs 803 per 14.2 kg cylinder in Delhi from Rs 903) providing additional savings

The decline would have been more substantial if not for the increased prices of onion (11%), potato (16%) and vegetable oil (18%) year-on-year, says CRISIL.

In some relief for the common man, the cost of a home-cooked vegetarian thali declined year-on-year in February, according to CRISIL’s latest monthly indicator of food plate cost, RRR (Roti Rice Rate). The cost of a non-vegetarian thali, however grew approximately 6% due to rise in broiler (chicken) prices, the report said. On a month-on-month basis the cost of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian thalis came down.The calculation of an average thali's preparation cost at home by CRISIL considers input prices across different regions of India. Monthly variations indicate the impact on everyday household expenses. The analysis tracks price movements of essential ingredients including cereals, pulses, broilers, vegetables, spices, edible oil and cooking gas.The rise in non-vegetarian thali prices was primarily due to a 15% year-on-year increase in broiler (chicken) prices.

This reduction was attributed to fresh supplies causing price drops in onion (7%), potato (17%), and tomato (25%).

NEW DELHI: Illegal online financial activities, including betting and gambling, have surged dramatically in India in recent years. A report by the Digital India Foundation revealed that digital platforms recorded a staggering 1.6 billion visits in just three months across four major websites.The report highlighted that the majority of these visits were organic, exceeding 184 million—significantly higher than the 42.8 million visits generated through social media platforms.Mirror websites also played a major role in the booming illegal market. Three Parimatch mirror sites alone accounted for an additional 266 million visits, further amplifying the scale of unregulated betting.""Despite repeated government actions, including website blocking and advisories, illegal operators continue to thrive, leveraging advanced digital marketing tactics, seamless payment processing, and mirror websites to evade enforcement,"" the report stated.According to ANI, the report attributed this success to sophisticated digital marketing strategies, frictionless payment processing, and mirror websites that allow these platforms to bypass enforcement measures.The report further noted: ""While major digital platforms prohibit betting and gambling-related promotions, enforcement remains highly inconsistent. Advertisements on Facebook’s Ad Network have grown exponentially in recent years.""The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Finance, in 2023, had also raised major concerns over online betting sites facilitating money laundering and terror financing.The report also found that 1.098 billion visits to illegal platforms originated from users directly entering website URLs, indicating the lasting impact of past marketing campaigns and referrals.The study further cited global experiences from the UK, Norway, Denmark, Belgium, and the United States, where website blocking alone proved ineffective. These countries have seen greater success by combining website restrictions with marketing bans, payment blocking, and curated whitelists and blocklists.To address this growing challenge, the report emphasized the need to move beyond current strategies and adopt a more holistic, ecosystem-based approach.""India must shift from its fragmented enforcement strategy to a comprehensive, ecosystem-based approach that effectively disrupts the key enablers sustaining illegal betting and gambling operations,"" the report suggested.It recommended stricter controls on digital media channels that drive user acquisition, tighter financial regulations to block illicit transactions, and enhanced enforcement mechanisms to ensure the long-term disruption of illegal betting networks.","Illegal online financial activities, including betting and gambling, have surged dramatically in india in recent years.

Gold prices have reached new record highs, but Gold ETFs experienced a notable slowdown in February, with monthly inflows dropping by 47.22% to Rs 1,979 crore, compared to Rs 3,751 crore in January.Despite this decline, the inflows in Gold ETFs have still seen a 99% year-on-year increase, from Rs 997 crore in February 2024. This shift signals a complex market scenario, where profit-taking after gold’s price surge and attractive opportunities in the equity markets are reshaping investor behaviour, according to an ET report.“The decline in inflows can be attributed to profit booking, as gold surged to an all-time high last month, prompting investors to lock in gains,” explained Nehal Meshram, Senior Analyst – Manager Research at Morningstar Investment Research India.“Additionally, equity market corrections presented attractive buying opportunities, leading some investors to shift focus from gold ETFs to equities.” he added.Gold ETFs still managed to deliver an average return of 3.34% in February, with UTI Gold ETF emerging as the top performer, returning 3.70%. Other ETFs such as Kotak Gold ETF, Zerodha Gold ETF, and DSP Gold ETF provided 3.54% returns. Invesco India Gold ETF and Tata Gold ETF returned 3.08% and 2.48%, respectively.Nehal also pointed out that the expectation of potential interest rate cuts by global central banks has dampened the urgency for safe-haven investments like gold. Despite the decline in inflows, gold continues to be an essential portfolio diversifier, especially with global economic conditions remaining uncertain. Gold’s role as a hedge against market instability is expected to maintain its appeal in the coming months.The assets under management (AUM) for Gold ETFs grew by 7%, reaching Rs 55,677 crore in February, compared to Rs 51,839 crore in January. On a yearly basis, AUM surged nearly 95%, up from Rs 28,529 crore in February 2024.Ajay Garg, CEO of SMC Global Securities, added, “The gold ETFs’ net inflows have decreased, but their AAUM grew by 15% to Rs 55,001.75 crore. This rise is due to a sharp rally in gold prices, which can also fuel the investor’s interest in gold ETFs in the near future.”According to the latest data from the Association of Mutual Funds in India (AMFI), only one new Gold ETF scheme was launched in February, with Union Gold ETF collecting Rs 11 crore.","Gold prices have reached new record highs, but gold etfs experienced a notable slowdown in february.

BENGALURU: Global capability centres are increasingly recruiting talent from IT services companies, with approximately half their workforce now sourced directly from these firms. Data from HR consultancy Xpheno indicates that GCCs have modified their recruitment approach, incorporating both experienced professionals and fresh graduates.Recent statistics reveal GCCs now source 45-48% of their workforce from IT firms, up from 35% in 2022-23. They offer premium salaries ranging from 20% to 30% higher than IT firms for those working in emerging areas like cloud, data and analytics. In cybersecurity and AI, GCCs maintain a 10% to 15% higher compensation for key positions, compared to IT companies, despite the overall slowdown in the technology hiring segment. ""Talent from the tier-1 players dominates the corridor of talent movement from IT services to GCCs. The mid-tier players fared relatively better on ring fencing and retained their talent from getting into corridor absorptions by GCCs. While mid-tier players do lose talent to GCCs, their scale is lower, and the current movement is roughly a 30-70 split between the mid-tier and tier-1 talent absorbed by GCCs,"" said Kedar Pathak, GCC specialist at Xpheno.Both new and expanding GCCs are driving recruitment in India, where 75% of their technology operations are based. These centres are expanding beyond traditional hubs into emerging locations like Coimbatore and Jaipur, according to HR consultancy NLB Services. These cities have developed substantial tech talent pools due to IT services companies' presence.ANSR's cofounder Vikram Ahuja notes that GCCs are increasingly partnering with finishing schools to secure candidates with specific skill sets. He said that campus recruitment isn't their primary focus. ""Over the last two to three years, tapping finishing schools rose from a negligible 5% to about 10% now. In the next two to three years, I feel it will go up to 20%. In the longer run, this segment will contribute a great deal to the talent needs of GCCs as there is a lot of competition in the tech market with product firms, startups, and services cohorts,"" Ahuja said.Senior-level recruitment remains strong, with Xpheno reporting over 100 VPs, AVPs, and SVPs moving from IT services to GCCs within a year. This represents 10% of IT services' senior workforce, with other senior hires going to product companies and startups, primarily driven by better compensation.
