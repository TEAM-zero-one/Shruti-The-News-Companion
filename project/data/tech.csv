MobiKwik loses Rs 40 crore in 48 hours,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/mobikwik-loses-rs-40-crore-in-48-hours/articleshow/123933014.cms,"GURGAON: Taking advantage of what is believed to be a glitch that blindsided city-based digital wallet company MobiKwik's systems, around Rs 40 crore were allegedly siphoned off over two days, Sept 11 and 12, from the company's account through a blitz of UPI transactions.The fraud came to light on Tuesday after the arrest of six men whose accounts contained Rs 9 lakh of this stolen money. Uncannily, this is the second time this has happened to MobiKwik. In Oct 2017, the company was allegedly similarly defrauded of around Rs 19 crore with the money being moved to thousands of personal bank accounts. This time, the glitch happened after the company updated its software earlier this month, investigators said. It apparently allowed Mobikwik users to send much higher amounts of money than their wallet balances. Transactions, the investigators said, also went through if users entered incorrect PINs.Police said how scamsters came to know about this glitch is under probe. Officials said they suspected insiders' involvement. The fraud was reported on Sept 13 by a MobiKwik employee, citing an audit that had detected suspicious transactions on Sept 11 and 12.According to cops, fraudulent transfers over those two hours amounted to Rs 40.2 crore. ""Nearly 5 lakh transactions took place on Sept 11-12, and so far, 2,500 bank beneficiary accounts have been identified. We have managed to freeze Rs 8 crore out of the total fraud amount. This money was deposited in these bank accounts,"" said a source.Five of the arrested men are from Nuh. The other is from Palwal. The accused have been identified as Rehan, Waqar Yunus, Wasim Akram, Mohd Amir, Mohd Ansar and Mohd Sakil. All six have been sent to judicial custody.Police spokesperson Ashok Kumar said if any company employee is found to be involved in the scam, strict action will be taken against the individual. Nuh police on Tuesday, meanwhile, asked people to report by Sept 23 any unexplained cash transfers they might have received in their accounts.""If anyone received transactions on Sept 11 and 12 due to technical security lapses or other reasons via the Mobikwik app or received unauthorised payments through the app and wishes to return them, or has any complaints related to such transactions, they can visit the office of the SP. People from Palwal district and other Mewat areas can also come."" Nuh police said in a statement. They have been charged under Section 318(4) (cheating) and 314 (dishonest misappropriation of property) of BNS. Cops are also coordinating with banks to recover the money and identify others who benefited from the alleged fraud.""The company is undertaking all possible and necessary efforts to recover the amount. However, since the police investigation and recovery efforts have just started, it's not yet possible to ascertain the impact. Based on the preliminary data, as a risk mitigating measure, the FIR was lodged for an amount of Rs 40 crore, out of which, the company has recovered around Rs 14 crore. Thus, the estimated net impact is Rs 26 crore. The company is taking aggressive collection efforts while pursuing legal course of action to recover the full amount over a period of time,"" a company spokesperson told TOI.","The fraud came to light on tuesday after the arrest of six men whose accounts contained rs 9 lakh of this stolen money.

Screams, Chains, Panic: Inside ICE’s Biggest Worksite Raid; Hyundai Georgia Plant Turns 'War Zone'

A group of 56 Indian travellers was subjected to “most inhuman behaviour” by Georgian authorities while trying to enter the country from Armenia, a woman alleged in a viral social media post Tuesday.In a post on Instagram, user Dhruvee Patel said the group, despite holding valid e-visas and documents, faced humiliation and prolonged detention at the Sadakhlo border, the primary land crossing between Armenia and Georgia.She claimed they were “made to wait 5+ hrs in the freezing cold – no food, no toilet.” Patel further alleged that officials “confiscated passports for 2+ hrs with no communication” and forced the travellers to sit on the footpath “like cattle.”She said the authorities even recorded videos of them “like criminals” but stopped them from filming the incident. Their documents, she added, were not even checked, with officials simply declaring the visas “wrong.”Calling the treatment “shameful & unacceptable,” Patel tagged PM Modi and external affairs minister S Jaishankar in her post, writing, “India must take a strong stand.” She ended her post with a sharp rebuke: “This is how Georgia treats Indians. Shameful & unacceptable!”The post received mixed reactions online, with many Indians sharing similar ordeals.One user commented, “I’ve actually had so many civilised friends visit Georgia and had the same treatment… Trust me, it has nothing to do with civic sense or anything cause these girls were dressed very smartly, spoke softly and were extremely polite. The officials are just rude.”While one user remarked, “Depends. Were they squatting and eating Khakra at the airport while dancing to garba? Coz I have seen it!” another questioned, “When this behaviour has been consistent from Georgia then why do Indians keep going there.”A traveller who visited Georgia in 2019 shared a more mixed perspective. They recalled hearing similar stories before their trip but said they were eventually granted entry and went on to enjoy a “dream visit.” Still, they added, “from the last many years they are creating problems for Indians, that's a sad story.”","A group of 56 indian travellers was subjected to “most inhuman behaviour” by georgian authorities.

In a world where alliances are shifting, Delhi is seeking multiple players for its innovation story. Its new initiative, Bharat Innovates 2026, is designed to showcase Indian deep-tech talent, connect institutions with global capital, and position India as a predictable partner in unpredictable times.The first showcase will take place in Nice, France, from June 17 to 19, 2026, where around 100 ventures will be presented to European investors, policymakers and technology leaders. By making Europe the first testing ground, India is underlining its strategic intent - tying its innovation ambitions to a continent looking to diversify away from global supply chain tensions.Under the aegis of the ministry of education and guided by the principal scientific adviser, with IIT-Bombay as nodal institution, the ventures will span critical domains such as biotechnology, Industry 4.0, smart cities and mobility, AI and quantum computing, space and defence, semiconductors, agri-food technologies, medtech, sustainable energy, advanced materials and rare-earth minerals.The scale and timing of the initiative reflect a broader geopolitical recalibration. With supply chain disruptions, policy volatility in Washington and escalating global trade rivalry, Europe is searching for stable technology partners. For Brussels, India is steadily emerging as a reliable alternative. German economy minister Robert Habeck recently called India ""a key partner of the German economy in the Indo-Pacific,"" while European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen said in today's ""intense geostrategic competition,"" Europe intends to ""strengthen ties with one of our most reliable allies. ""For India, too, the move is deliberate. Govt has been signalling India's readiness to offer consistency at a time of turbulence. By creating platforms like Bharat Innovates, India is simultaneously diversifying partnerships, hedging its geopolitical bets and inviting global investment into homegrown innovation.Over 430 applications, which remains open until Sept 30, have been initiated of which majority are from healthcare and medtech, energy and sustainability, advance computing and AI, and space and defence.","India is throwing open the doors of its universities and national research labs.

"India's power sector emission could peak before 2030, it fell by 1% year-on-year in the first half of 2025, says study",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/emissions-from-power-sector-down-1-year-on-year-in-first-half-of-2025-says-study/articleshow/123959377.cms,"NEW DELHI: In what could be a positive outcome of India’s growing renewable energy footprint, a new analysis based on official monthly data has shown that the country’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from its power sector fell by 1% year-on-year in the first half of 2025 and by 0.2% over the past 12 months – this is only the second instance of such a drop in almost half a century.The analysis also indicates that emissions from India’s power sector could peak before 2030 if clean-energy capacity and electricity demand grow as expected.“The future of CO2 emissions in India is a key indicator for the world, with the country – the world’s most populous – having contributed nearly two-fifths of the rise in global energy-sector emissions since 2019,” said the reportprepared by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) for Carbon Brief (a UK-based website covering the latest developments in climate science and policy).The analysis also highlighted the substantial growth in India’s clean energy capacity, which has grown by a record 25.1 GW in the first half of 2025.“This was a 69% increase compared with the previous period in 2024, which had also set a record,” said the report, noting that solar continued to dominate new installations, accounting for 14.3 GW of capacity addition from large scale solar projects and 3.2 GW capacity from solar rooftop.In fact, progress on the renewable front helped India achieve a landmark in its energy transition journey: non-fossil fuel sources now account for 50% of its total installed electricity capacity. This has been attained five years ahead of the target set under the country’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) – climate action commitment – to the Paris Agreement.As of June 30, India’s installed electricity capacity from non-fossil fuel sources stood at242.8 GW – with the total installed capacity at484.8 GW. The CREA’s report noted that the country is expected to add another 16–17 GW of solar and wind capacity in the second half of 2025.Referring to the slowdown in India’s CO2 emission growth since 2024, the report said the largest contributor to the phenomenon was the power sector, which was responsible for 60% of the drop in emissions growth rates, when the first half of 2025 is compared to the years 2021-23.“Oil demand growth slowed sharply as well, contributing 20% of the slowdown. The only sectors to keep growing their emissions in the first half of 2025 were steel and cement production,” said the report. It attributed the CO2 emissions growth from steel and cement production, by 7% and 10%, respectively, to the government’s infrastructure spending.The report noted that the reduction in coal use, on the other hand, comes after more than a decade of break-neck growth, starting in the early 2010s and only interrupted by Covid in 2020. “While coal-power generation is expected to flatline, large amounts of new coal-power capacity is still being planned, because of the expected growth in peak electricity demand,” it said.","India’s carbon dioxide (co2) emissions from its power sector fell by 1% year-on-year in the first half of 2025 and by 0.2% over the past 12 months.

Turning Olympic wins into major endorsement deals

Building businesses beyond the track and stadiums

From small-town boy to the fastest sprinter

Facing financial challenges and staying determined

Enjoying family life away from the spotlight

The fastest man alive is still setting the pace off the track. Even years after retiring, Usain Bolt has transformed his Olympic glory into a $90 million fortune through smart endorsements, and thriving businesses . From breaking world records to building a lasting legacy, Bolt proves that speed can create influence far beyond the finish line.Bolt’s wealth has been fueled largely by endorsements. Puma reportedly paid him $9 million annually, while deals with Visa, Gatorade, and Nissan added millions more. Even after retiring, these partnerships continue to generate income. Appearance fees, brand collaborations, and public speaking engagements further bolster his net worth, showing that his global appeal remains unmatched.Post-retirement, Bolt expanded into entrepreneurship. He co-founded Bolt Mobility, an electric scooter company, and grew his restaurant chain, Tracks & Records, internationally. These ventures diversify his income while keeping him connected to his roots. Through business, Bolt has proven that athletic talent can evolve into long-term financial success.Born in 1986 in Sherwood Content, Jamaica, Bolt’s speed set him apart from an early age.Over his career, he became the first sprinter to hold world records in the 100m (9.58s), 200m (19.19s), and 4x100m relay (36.84s) simultaneously. Winning eight Olympic gold medals across three Games, he retired in 2017, leaving a trail of records and unforgettable moments. His signature “lightning bolt” celebration became a global symbol of excellence and joy.Not all of Bolt’s post-retirement journey has been smooth. In 2023, $12.7 million disappeared from his account at a Jamaican investment firm due to alleged fraud. While the case prompted investigations, Bolt remained focused on growth and protecting his business interests.Away from the public eye, Bolt enjoys a grounded life in Kingston with his partner Kasi Bennett and their three children. He spends time on simple pleasures like assembling Lego sets and watching movies, creating a balance between his high-energy track career and personal fulfillment.Bolt’s journey proves that speed, vision, and resilience can create lasting influence. His $90 million net worth in 2025 reflects a combination of athletic brilliance, business acumen, and global recognition. As the greatest sprinter of all time, Usain Bolt continues to inspire generations, showing that true legacy goes far beyond medals and records.Also Read: The entire controversy between FaZe Rain and Temperr explained","Usain bolt has transformed his olympic glory into a $90 million fortune through smart endorsements, and thriving businesses.

Indian IT giants are preparing for a wave of contract renewals worth about $13 billion to December end, offering companies like Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), Infosys, HCLTech, and Wipro a chance to secure a share of the info tech market.The surge comes as clients push for cost savings and AI-driven efficiency, according to data from research and analyst firms shared with ET. According to industry estimates, deal renewals this year could surpass the $14 billion recorded in 2024.In India’s $283 billion software export industry, large deals usually start at $100 million, while mega deals exceed $500 million. More than 600 contracts are due for renewal in the second half of 2025, with values ranging from $20 million to over $1 billion, and some topping $2 billion, according to US-based Everest Group.Major deals include TCS’s partnerships with Star Alliance and Nielsen, Infosys’ contracts with Daimler AG and GE Appliances, HCLTech’s agreements with Ericsson and UK insurer Chesnara; and Wipro’s deals with German utility E.ON, Finland’s Fortum, and Brazil’s Petrobras.Earlier this month, TCS bagged a $640 million order from Danish insurer Tryg on a seven-year contract, its first major deal since January 2024.Wipro renewed a two-year contract with European food wholesaler Metro, extending a previous four-year partnership, ET reported.ISG, a tech research firm, says over 800 renewals are expected, including many from financial services and manufacturing, with mega deals worth around $1.7 billion. In the first half of 2025, about $1.3 billion in mega deals were in the renewal pipeline, covering roughly 70% of global IT deal activity.“The number of mega awards contracts with annual values of $100 million or more has been rising over the past two years. Large deal activity remains strong in 2025,” Namratha Dharshan, chief business leader at ISG, was quoted as saying by ET.She added, “The combination of strong mega deal renewal profile, along with the current macro environment that supports the creation of new mega awards, suggests that large deal activity will remain strong in 2025. This is because enterprises continue to be focused on reducing costs, and providers are focused on shaping large deals.”Darshan further explained that while big deals are gaining traction, deal sizes in the business process outsourcing (BPO) sector are generally getting smaller.She added that these smaller deals reflect cautious discretionary spending, which has remained subdued over the past 2–3 years due to challenging macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions.Yugal Joshi, partner at Everest Group, said average deal sizes are now slightly under $100 million.“Last year, (in the) same period, there were over 700 deals, and they were typically of larger sizes…We have begun to witness initial signs of irrational deal constructs, especially around task automation due to AI agents in the market, and we are not confident that all providers will meet the intended delivery objectives,” he told ET.Renewals come amid a slowdown in global tech demand triggered by the US-led tariff war, affecting India’s software export sector.Clients are increasingly seeking discounts during renewals and demanding AI-led benefits.Joshi added that AI is now playing a major role in deciding which companies win contracts, unlike before when around 90% of renewals went to incumbents.","Indian it giants are preparing for a wave of contract renewals worth about $13 billion to december end.

‘Scripted!’: Are Tyler Robinson’s texts with his trans partner 'fake'?

Poll Do you trust text messages shared online as evidence? Yes, they can be reliable No, they may be doctored or misleading





Text messages released by prosecutors in the case of Tyler Robinson, the 22-year-old accused of assassinating conservative activist Charlie Kirk, have fuelled a storm of scepticism online. While prosecutors say the exchanges between Robinson and his transgender partner reveal his planning, motive and fears, critics argue the messages are “doctored” and “scripted.”Right-wing commentator Candace Owens was among the first to question their authenticity. “These messages are clearly doctored,” she wrote, accusing the government of cherry-picking texts to fit a narrative. “They should be released with timestamps and every single message made public.”On X, the debate has only intensified. “Extremely fake. They planned this text exchange as a cover-up. Very scripted,” wrote one user, while another said: “This sounds scripted, I bet they planned this out beforehand to make it sound like the boyfriend wasn’t involved.” Others mocked the tone of the messages, with comments like: “I’ve never once heard an engineer talk like this” and “What 22 year old would text like this???? What person who isn’t a robot would text like this??”Some fixated on specific language, pointing to Robinson’s references to “my love” and “my old man” as unconvincing.One user argued that the absence of emojis was proof enough: “The messages between Tyler Robinson and his trans chick are either fake or scripted because there is not a single emoticon.” Another account dismissed them as “transcribed by the FBI,” while one sceptic went further: “These alleged text messages between Tyler Robinson and his conveniently trans 'lover' are unquestionably fake. AIs agree. They read like a badly written playscript with a rightwing agenda.”Despite the online claims, prosecutors insist the messages form part of the evidence linking Robinson to the killing. Utah County Attorney Jeff Gray said Robinson’s DNA was found on the trigger of the bolt-action rifle used to fatally shoot Kirk at Utah Valley University on 10 September. Robinson also left a note saying he had “the opportunity to take out Charlie Kirk and I’m going to take it.”Court records show Robinson had admitted in texts to planning the attack “a bit over a week.” Prosecutors allege he later told his partner to delete the messages and stay silent if approached by police. Charged with aggravated murder and facing the possibility of the death penalty, Robinson has yet to respond to the mounting claims that the evidence against him may not be all it seems.","Tyler robinson, 22, accused of killing conservative activist charlie kirk.

Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is preparing to introduce its latest wearable technology at the annual Connect event, which is widely seen as a showcase for its augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions, innovation roadmap, and future consumer experiences. This new product represents the company’s first consumer-ready smart glasses with an integrated digital display, signaling a significant step in Meta’s long-term strategy to bring advanced AI into everyday life and enhance human-computer interaction.The glasses, expected to retail at around $800, will carry the internal code name “Hypernova” and are likely to launch under the brand name “Celeste.” While the glasses’ display is relatively small, it is designed to handle basic digital interactions such as notifications, alerts, messages, and reminders, offering users a glimpse into the potential of AR without being fully immersive.Meta is positioning this launch not just as a gadget, but as a foundational element in its broader vision of wearable technology that interacts seamlessly with AI, potentially transforming the way people access information, collaborate remotely, and connect with the digital world.Over the past several years, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has committed enormous resources—more than $60 billion since 2020—into Meta’s augmented reality and AI divisions.The company envisions smart glasses as a key interface for what is sometimes referred to as “superintelligence,” a theoretical AI that surpasses human capabilities across nearly every cognitive domain.Meta already offers two existing lines of smart glasses in partnership with Ray-Ban and Oakley, which include AI-driven features like cameras, hands-free controls, and livestreaming capabilities to Meta’s social platforms. These products have achieved moderate consumer success, selling around two million units since 2023, making Meta one of the few tech giants to gain traction in the smart glasses market—a market where competitors like Google have struggled.The new Celeste glasses, however, are distinct from these earlier offerings. They represent a step toward more advanced AR capabilities, though they remain less sophisticated than the “Orion” prototype showcased last year, which was presented by Zuckerberg as a “time machine to the future.” Orion, slated for launch in 2027, is expected to be far more technologically advanced and consumer-ready for immersive AR experiences.Celeste will feature a small, integrated display in the right lens, offering essential functions such as notifications and alerts. Analysts have suggested that this modest approach allows Meta to introduce AR to the consumer market gradually, focusing on usability and developer engagement rather than attempting a full-fledged, high-cost immersive device right away.In addition to the glasses, Meta is expected to introduce a new wristband accessory that will allow users to control the device with hand gestures. This accessory enhances interactivity, letting users navigate the glasses without needing to touch them physically, and represents a step toward hands-free, seamless integration of AR into daily life.The company may also incorporate branding collaborations, with rumors suggesting that the Italian fashion house Prada could provide design input. Prada’s signature thick frames and arms could help house the necessary components for the display, battery, and sensors while giving the glasses a premium aesthetic.One of the primary concerns for Celeste is its price. As reported by Reuters, at approximately $800, the glasses are substantially more expensive than Meta’s existing Ray-Ban and Oakley lines, which start at $299 and $399, respectively. Analysts warn that this pricing could limit adoption to tech enthusiasts and early adopters, rather than appealing to a broad consumer base.Jitesh Ubrani, research manager at IDC, pointed out that the device is likely to be somewhat bulky and less consumer-friendly, predicting that sales might reach only a few hundred thousand units initially. Nevertheless, he emphasized that the launch could play a strategic role in attracting developers to create apps for the platform, paving the way for more advanced, mass-market AR devices in the future.Meta’s innovation drive has not been without controversy. The company has faced scrutiny over its handling of child safety on its social media and virtual reality platforms. Whistleblowers have claimed that internal policies previously allowed AI chatbots to engage children in inappropriate conversations, and researchers were allegedly discouraged from investigating potential harms related to VR experiences. Meta has since revised these policies to prohibit such interactions and improve child protection measures.The timing of the Celeste launch highlights the tension Meta faces: the company is racing to maintain relevance in the AI and AR sectors while simultaneously responding to ongoing ethical and regulatory concerns. How it manages these risks will influence consumer trust and adoption of its new wearable products.A key component of the Celeste launch is Meta’s emphasis on developer engagement. The company plans to open the device to third-party developers through a new software kit, enabling external creators to build AR applications and utilities for the glasses.This approach reflects a long-term strategy: while initial sales might be modest, building a robust developer ecosystem is essential for creating a sustainable market for AR devices. By fostering innovation in apps and experiences, Meta hopes to expand the appeal of smart glasses and gradually transition toward more advanced, mainstream products like the Orion headset.","Meta platforms, the parent company of facebook and instagram, is preparing to introduce its latest wearable technology at the annual connect event.

Why Patch 11.06 is a milestone for Valorant







Riot Games has rolled out Valorant Patch 11.06, introducing the long-awaited Replay System for Competitive, Unrated, Swiftplay, and Premier matches. This feature allows players across all platforms—PC and consoles—to review gameplay, analyze strategies, and revisit key moments, providing a powerful tool for both casual gamers and esports professionals.The update also targets disruptive bot activity, with around 40,000 bot accounts banned over the past six months in a sustained and ongoing ban wave, improving matchmaking fairness. Agent-specific bugs, including rare issues affecting Yoru and Reyna, have been resolved, while PC performance has been enhanced with permanently enabled input settings, streamlining gameplay responsiveness.Console players receive fixes for New Player Tips, improving guidance for newcomers, although a known issue remains where dropped weapons and the Spike incorrectly highlight when players are merely nearby rather than directly looking at them. Riot has confirmed this will be fixed in Patch 11.07. Overall, Patch 11.06 strengthens Valorant’s competitive and casual gameplay across all platforms.One of the most exciting features in Patch 11.06 is the Replay System, now available for Competitive, Unrated, Swiftplay, and Premier matches on all platforms, including consoles and mobile devices. This system allows players to review past games, analyze key moments, evaluate strategies, track performance trends, and share highlights with teammates or friends with precise control over replay playback.The feature is designed to be versatile: casual players can revisit clutch plays, important mistakes, or learning opportunities to improve personal gameplay, while professional esports teams can use the tool to refine team strategies, study opponents’ tactics, and optimize coordinated team performance across competitive tournaments.A major concern for Valorant players has been bot activity, particularly in lower ranks where artificial accounts can disrupt fair matchmaking. In Patch 11.06, Riot has taken significant action by banning approximately 40,000 bot accounts over the last six months, reflecting a continued and sustained crackdown on bots.This crackdown is expected to improve the quality and fairness of matches, particularly for new and casual players who are most affected by bot interference.Patch 11.06 also addresses agent-related bugs that could impact gameplay. Notably, a rare bug affecting Yoru and Reyna has been fixed. Previously, under very specific conditions, these agents would return to their original location after their invisibility ended, creating unintended advantages or confusing gameplay scenarios.On the technical side, Riot Games has optimized the PC version of Valorant by removing the RawInputBuffer setting as a configurable option and keeping it permanently enabled. Developers found that this change provides better input performance, making gameplay smoother and more responsive for all PC players.Patch 11.06 also brings changes for console users. Riot fixed issues with New Player Tips, ensuring they display correctly to help guide newcomers.However, a known issue remains where dropped weapons and the Spike highlight incorrectly, triggering when players are merely nearby rather than directly looking at these objects. Riot has confirmed this will be addressed in Patch 11.07, showing ongoing attention to console-specific gameplay refinements.Launch the Riot Games client on your PC.

Combined with the ongoing bot bans, agent bug fixes, and performance improvements—including a permanent input optimization on PC—Riot is clearly focused on strengthening both casual and competitive gameplay experiences.This update reflects Riot’s commitment to fair play, player learning, and platform stability, creating a better environment for all types of Valorant players—from beginners to professional esports competitors.","Riot games has rolled out valorant patch 11.06, introducing the long-awaited replay system for competitive, unrated, swiftplay, and premier matches.
