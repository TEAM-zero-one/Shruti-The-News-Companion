What does Josh Allen drive?

Inside Josh Allen’s SUPER SIZED Car Collection

Also read:

Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen has built a reputation as one of the NFL’s most dominant player, but his success off the field is just as visible - especially when it comes to what’s parked in his garage. From rugged trucks built for harsh Buffalo winters to high-end luxury and speed machines, Allen’s car collection reflects both his personality and his journey from small-town roots to NFL superstardom.Allen’s rise in the NFL has been matched by a major financial leap. After signing a six-year, $258 million contract extension with the Bills in 2021, the quarterback gained the freedom to indulge in his love for powerful vehicles. Yet, his choices suggest balance rather than excess. Many of Allen’s cars are built for utility and durability, fitting for a quarterback who plays in one of the league’s coldest markets.One of the cars of his garage is the Jeep Grand Wagoneer, a full-size SUV powered by a twin-turbo V8 engine. With all-wheel drive and a spacious, luxury-filled interior, it’s a practical choice for Buffalo winters while still offering premium comfort.Allen has never hidden his appreciation for trucks, a nod to his upbringing in Firebaugh, California. His Ford F-150 Raptor, customized in an all-black finish, stands out as one of the most rugged vehicles he owns. Equipped with a powerful V8 engine and impressive ground clearance, the Raptor is built for tough terrain and poor weather, ideal for Western New York conditions.Adding to the SUV-heavy lineup is the Range Rover Sport, which blends performance, off-road ability, and luxury. With a refined interior and strong engine options, the Range Rover offers Allen a smoother, more polished driving experience without sacrificing strength.Allen’s garage also features vehicles that lean more toward style and speed. The Mercedes-Benz G-Wagon, known for its boxy design and elite status, brings both luxury and brute force. Its V8 engine and plush interior make it a favorite among elite athletes, and Allen is no exception.Josh Allen also owns a Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat. With nearly 800 horsepower under the hood, the Hellcat is the most aggressive car in his collection, designed for straight-line speed and raw performance.Rounding out the collection is Allen’s most exotic ride, the Aston Martin Vantage. Sleek, fast, and unmistakably premium, the Vantage represents Allen’s taste for high-end performance cars. With a 0-60 mph time in just three seconds, it stands apart from his trucks and SUVs, highlighting a taste for refined speed.Josh Allen’s car collection isn’t about flash alone. It mirrors his journey grounded, powerful, and versatile.","Buffalo bills quarterback josh allen's car collection reflects both his personality and his journey from small-town roots to nfl superstardom.

How Brooklyn Beckham has built his personal fortune

Nicola Peltz’s Hollywood career and billionaire family backing

Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz have become one of the hottest pairs of young celebrity couple watchers, thanks to both their famous surnames and the rarefied (and distinct) financial universes they inhabit. Bringing together British sports and fashion royalty with an American dynasty of Hollywood and high finance, their marriage endowed a joint fortune that captivated public imagination.Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz have a combined net worth of about $60 million in 2025. While these fortunes sit next door to much larger family fortunes that continue to define their lifestyle, opportunities, and financial safety, this figure represents their earnings from creative careers that brought them to our attention in the first place.Anybody with a last name Beckham could show up and just straight-up stomp the rest of them, but Brooklyn Beckham, son of famous footballer David Beckham and fashion designer Victoria Beckham, has been working hard to build up a career apart from the famous family. Most of his income has been through modeling campaigns, commercial photography assignments, and sponsored collaborations related to fashion, food, and lifestyle brands.Although his publishing and culinary projects have elicited a more erratic response from critics, brand tie-ins and social media collaborations have been a veritable financial goldmine. We estimate Brooklyn Beckham to have a dominantly stagnant commercial but blockbuster, sparse personal net worth of $10 million by 2025.Nicola Peltz brings a different financial profile to the marriage. She also has a long history of acting in television productions and major film franchises, as well as modeling and other appearances in the fashion industry for more income. All of these put together have allowed her to acquire an estimated personal net worth of around 50 million dollars.In addition to her personal income, Nicola Peltz has the granddaddy of all sources of wealth, as she is the daughter of hedge fund mogul Nelson Peltz. While this family fortune is not technically included in her individual wealth, it bestows one access to large amounts of money, such as through luxury real estate, private investments, and elite business circles.Brooklyn Beckham and Nicola Peltz are the perfect modern union between a famous couple whose individual monetary pursuits are inexplicably tied to familial connections. A combined $60 million net worth certainly reflects what each of them has, but the rest of their family lines seem to continue giving them public exposure and wifely earnings power. Their account of ever-growing riches in 2025 has less to do with consolidation than it does with the merging of celebrity, family, and meticulously crafted careers.Also Read: Beckham family rift deepens: Brooklyn unfollows parents David and Victoria, spends Christmas apart","Brooklyn beckham and nicola peltz have a combined net worth of about $60 million in 2025.

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon musk has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

In March 2025, Xavier Worthy showed off his new custom-built garage, almost a year after his expensive car was stolen

In May 2024, Kansas City Chiefs wide receiver Xavier Worthy’s expensive car was stolen after it went missing overnight, the Kansas City Police Department told the Kansas City Star. The car was reportedly taken from a downtown parking garage at Two Light Apartments in the 1400 block of Grand Boulevard. A source for Mike Florio of NBC Sports said Worthy’s car was stolen from a residential garage by a professional group of criminals who “knew exactly what they were doing.” Xavier was not in the car when it was taken and was unharmed; there was no carjacking. Only a month had passed since the Chiefs drafted him in the first round when his car was stolen. As of late 2025, there have reportedly been no public reports indicating that Worthy ever recovered his stolen car. Cut to the present: through his TikTok pages, Worthy reportedly owns four cars costing over $1 million. Let’s find out which are those.According to Spotrac, Chiefs wide receiver Xavier Worthy signed a four-year contract worth $13.79 million in June 2024. Worthy is reportedly known for owning expensive cars purchased with his rookie contract:The no-longer-a-rookie wide receiver has been seen arriving at Kansas City Chiefs games in a sleek, matte black Rolls-Royce Phantom, which reportedly costs more than $500,000.In a TikTok video, he was seen posing in front of a Dodge Charger SRT Hellcat. The US Sun reported in March 2025 that Worthy drove a Dodge Charger in college.On another TikTok page, he was seen posing in front of a shiny black Mercedes SUV.In March, Daily Athlete reported on Instagram that Worthy owns several other luxury cars, including a Bugatti. Xavier will make $800,000 after taxes in the 2025 season.J. Arturo Trujillo of Marca reported in March that instead of purchasing an expensive car, Worthy decided to customize his garage. He filled the place with key moments from his football career: huge photos of him with the Chiefs, time spent at the University of Texas, and a record-breaking performance at the NFL Combine. The garage floor had a striking bluish-black abstract art and featured “Chosen 1,” reflecting Worthy’s unique playing style. CH Customs helped with the customization. Xavier shared a video of his revamped garage on TikTok, and it quickly gained a lot of recognition.Also Read: Xavier Worthy: Rising Star, Super Bowl Hopes, Career Highlights, and More","Xavier worthy signed a four-year contract worth $13.79 million in june 2024.

Asmongold and Wendy Ortiz have had enough with the tipping obsession





Popular Kick streamer Asmongold is weighing in on the recent controversy regarding Wendy Ortiz's sister, Evelyn Ortiz’s recent encounter with a waitress. The controversy began after a short clip from Ortiz’s IRL livestream spread rapidly across X and Reddit. The video showed a waitress confronting Ortiz for leaving a $5 tip on a $250 bill. Despite Evelyn trying to prevent any unnecessary conflict, the waitress was less than impressed at the act.Asmongold addressed the whole awkward situation, criticizing tipping culture as a whole. The streamer called it a side effect of slavery and a form of abuse that should not be entertained. Ortiz also reflected on the incident, calling out how one should not be upset at the amount they got tipped.Reacting to Evelyn’s video, Asmongold wrote on X, “Tipping, a side effect from slavery, is a psyop created by the business ruling class to pit the middle class against the working class. Engaging in tip-shaming or forms of social compliance to continue tipping works solely to continue this abuse. Never tip if you don't want to.""Wendy Ortiz later addressed the situation directly, offering a more personal perspective shaped by her own experience.She pushed back on the idea that tips should be expected or demanded, saying, ""As a waitress/waiter, I don't think you can expect a tip and be, like, upset at what they got tipped.""At the same time, she made it clear she does believe in and advocate for the need to tip when services are good and even often reminds others to do so. Wendy also pointed out how unusual the US tipping culture can feel compared to other countries, where people get offended and become unnecessarily rude when they are not tipped.This latest news comes in light of Wendy Ortiz’s recent public clash with FaZe Clan member Rani “Stable Ronaldo” earlier this month, where she called him a woman-hater. Although Asmongold was not a fan of her comments then, he now comes to the defense of her sister, who got embroiled in an unnecessary conflict.Also read: Wendy Ortiz apologizes after calling Stable Ronaldo a “woman hater”","Kick streamer asmongold is weighing in on the recent controversy regarding wendy ortiz's sister, evelyn ortiz's recent encounter with a waitress.

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Fear-driven leadership powers AI chip giant's success

Seven-day workweeks extend beyond executive suite





Despite leading the world's most valuable company with a $4.4 trillion market cap, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang operates in constant fear of failure. In a recent appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, the 62-year-old executive revealed he works seven days a week in a perpetual ""state of anxiety"" about the company going bankrupt.""I'm not ambitious, I just want to stay alive,"" Huang told host Joe Rogan, explaining his 33-year mantra of running Nvidia as if it's ""30 days from going out of business."" The co-founder, who has led the chipmaker since 1993, said this feeling of vulnerability ""doesn't leave you"" despite the company's recent milestone of becoming the first public firm to reach a $5 trillion valuation in October.Huang's unconventional leadership approach stems from near-death experiences in the 1990s when Nvidia faced bankruptcy multiple times. He recalled flying to Japan to inform Sega that a contracted graphics chip was flawed and the deal should be canceled, while simultaneously admitting Nvidia needed the final $5 million payment to survive. Sega converted the funds into an investment, providing the lifeline that kept the company afloat.""I have a greater drive from not wanting to fail than the drive of wanting to succeed,"" Huang explained. The CEO maintains his intense work schedule by waking at 4 a.m.daily to read emails for hours, processing several thousand messages each day. This routine continues through holidays including Thanksgiving and Christmas.Huang's relentless work ethic has influenced his family, with both adult children Madison and Spencer working at Nvidia seven days a week. The siblings, who are in their 30s, initially pursued different careers before joining the company as interns in 2020 and 2022.Nvidia reported record revenue of $57 billion for its third quarter, driven by surging demand for AI chips that power technology from Microsoft, OpenAI and Meta. However, Huang told Rogan that scale hasn't changed his mindset: ""The sense of vulnerability, the sense of uncertainty, the sense of insecurity—it doesn't leave you.""","Jensen huang, ceo of $4.4 trillion ai chip giant nvidia, lives in constant fear of bankruptcy.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him. The IIT rejection redirected his life towards a path only few could have imagined and which eventually led him to become the CEO of Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable companies. Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software. Nadella further added that like many of friends he also viewed IIT as the pinnacle of academic achievement. But when he failed to secure admission, Nadella faced a setback that could have easily defined his future. Instead, it became the catalyst for a different journey.Nadella described IIT as “the holy grail” for middle-class students, acknowledging the weight of expectations. Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there. However, all these experiences helped him in building adaptability which later went ahead and defined his leadership style.Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992, after working at Sun Microsystems. Over, the next two decade he rose steadily through the ranks and the became the Microsoft CEO in 2014. When Nadella became the CEO, the company was facing a lot competition from Apple, Google and Amazon. However, under his leadership, Microsoft reinvented itself and it now a market valuation of $3.54 trillion.Nadella has often said that “only in America would someone like me get the chance to prove himself rather than be typecast based on the school I attended.”","Microsoft ceo satya nadella once shared his experience of how not going to iit which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him.

The state of AI adoption





American billionaire and entrepreneur Mark Cuban has now urged the young engineers entering the job market to prioritise small and medium-sized companies over multinational corporations (MNCs) when seeking opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI). Cuban feels that smaller companies offer better platform for new graduates to make an immediate impact, while large corporations often dilute individual contributions.Speaking in an interview with CNBC and on his podcast The Dumbest Guy in the Room, Cuban explained that smaller companies are mainly entrepreneur-driven and they lack the deep IT departments or larger corporations. This gap creates opportunities for fresh graduates which directly contribute to the AI projects.“Small- to medium-size companies don’t have that depth. They are typically entrepreneurially driven and don’t have the flexibility to have people research things. Bringing a new graduate on to work on agentic AI projects is inexpensive for them and can get them immediate results,” Cuban said.Cuban also used the example of his own company, Cost Plus Drugs, noting how AI can automate processes to boost productivity, competitiveness, and profitability.Cuban argued that in big organisations, AI skills may not stand out as they are common among thousands of IT employees. On the other hand, in smaller firms often lack such expertise, making new graduates with AI knowledge invaluable. He also compared the present wave of AI with early days of the internet, when young engineers were hired to implement new technologies because they were more comfortable with them than older executives.Cuban also highlighted that 95% of companies have not yet seen measurable revenue returns from AI investments. The exceptions, he said, are mostly early-stage startups led by young entrepreneurs who design their processes around AI models tailored to their businesses.He urged his children and other young people to learn as much as possible about AI, stressing that companies are still grappling with how to use the technology for competitive advantage.",Mark cuban has urged young engineers to prioritise small and medium-sized companies over multinational corporations (mncs) when seeking opportunities in artificial intelligence.

Gates believes artificial intelligence could be a solution to misinformation





Microsoft founder Bill Gates has now acknowledged that he was ‘very wrong’ in assuming that making information widely available would naturally lead people to seek out accurate facts. Speaking in an interview with CNBC, Gates said that the had been quite naive to believe that access to information alone would curb misinformation. But now he sees that as a growing problem which is being passed on the younger generation. Gates admitted that he underestimated the appeal of confirmation bias, the tendency for people to gravitate toward platforms and connect which reinforce their present views. ““When we made information available, I thought people would want correct information,” Gates said. “But even I wallow. If there’s a politician I don’t like, and there’s an article criticizing him—even if exaggerated—I enjoy reading it.”Gates perspective further shifted after heading his daughter Phoebe Gates description. Phoebe described how she was harassed online underscoring the personal toll of misinformation and online abuse. Phoebe who is also the co-founder of AI shopping tool Phia, has previously spoken about being “memed” for her interracial relationship, highlighting how misinformation and online ridicule can distort public perception.Gates believes that artificial intelligence could play an important role in combating misinformation and handling deepfakes. He emphasised that AI systems might be used to enforce rules and regulations around harmful content such as incitement to violence or vaccine misinformation available online.“We should have free speech. But if you’re inciting violence, if you’re causing people not to take vaccines, where are those boundaries? Even the U.S. should have rules. And if you have rules, is it some AI that encodes those rules?” Gates asked.Gates also acknowledged that the fight against misinformation will be cyclical, with new detection methods constantly challenged by countermeasures.

Oracle takes control of data security and algorithm oversight

Deal resolves years of regulatory uncertainty over Chinese ownership





TikTok has secured a rescue deal with American investors, signing binding agreements to create a new US entity that keeps the wildly popular app operational while satisfying national security requirements. The transaction, set to close January 22, comes just two days before a federal ban would have forced TikTok offline for its 170 million American users.CEO Shou Zi Chew announced the agreement in an internal memo, confirming partnerships with Oracle Corporation, investment firm Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi's state fund MGX. Together, these managing investors will control 45% of the new joint venture, with another 5% going to unnamed new investors. Existing ByteDance investor affiliates hold 30.1%, while ByteDance itself retains just 19.9%.The restructured TikTok will operate under a seven-member, majority-American board with final authority over content moderation and policy decisions within the United States. Oracle assumes responsibility as the ""trusted security partner,"" storing all sensitive US user data in American cloud servers while auditing compliance with national security terms.Critically, TikTok's prized recommendation algorithm—the engine behind its addictive content feed—will be retrained exclusively on US user data to eliminate potential foreign manipulation. Oracle will oversee this process and validate ongoing compliance, though industry observers note questions remain about whether the algorithm has been fully transferred or merely licensed from ByteDance.The agreement caps more than six years of questions about TikTok's future in the United States, driven by concerns that Beijing could access Americans' sensitive data or use the platform to spread propaganda. Congress passed legislation in April 2024 requiring ByteDance to divest its US operations or face prohibition, a law the Supreme Court upheld in January.The deal marks a significant expansion for Oracle beyond traditional enterprise software, positioning the company at the center of one of the world's most influential social media platforms.","Tiktok has struck a deal with american investors, including oracle and silver lake, to form a new us entity.

'Trump Needs Indian Skilled Workers': Expert On Big Tech's AI Bet On India

Demis Hassabis makes his stand clear on AI scaling





Google DeepMind CEo Demis Hassabis has once again warned that the present wave of AI startup valuations is unsustainable. He also raised concerns that there are chances that the tech sector is heading towards a correction. Speaking on Google DeepMind: The Podcast, Hassabis said many early-stage companies are now raising tens of billions dollars before even launching product. He believes that this trend exposes cracks in the valuation model. “Some startups basically haven’t even got going yet,” Hassabis said. “It’s sort of interesting to see how can that be sustainable. My guess is probably not, at least not in general.” This increase in speculative funding has drawn comparisons to past bubbles, such as the dot-com boom and the crypto frenzy, where companies raised massive sums on hype rather than proven business models.Hassabis emphasised that these seed-stage valuations with investments by established companies like Google, which he said are backed by “a lot of real business.” While Big Tech’s AI bets are supported by revenue streams and infrastructure, many startups are relying solely on investor enthusiasm.He added that AI is “overhyped in the short term” but “underappreciated in the medium to long-term,” suggesting that while the technology’s potential is profound, the current funding frenzy may not reflect sustainable growth.Reflecting on DeepMind’s own early days, Hassabis noted how technological shifts often swing from skepticism to obsession, inflating valuations quickly. “It’s almost an overreaction to the underreaction,” he said, pointing out that investor sentiment can flip dramatically once a technology gains traction.Recently, Google DeepMind CEO also made his stand clear on the debate over how far AI scaling laws can take the industry.As reported by Business Insider, speaking at the Axios AI+ Summit in San Francisco, Hassabis said that scaling current systems must be pushed to the maximum, calling it a critical path towards artificial general intelligence (AGI). “The scaling of the current systems, we must push that to the maximum, because at the minimum, it will be a key component of the final AGI system. It could be the entirety of the AGI system,” Hassabis told the audience.AGI is still a theoretical form of AI which is capable of reasoning as well as humans. AGI is also the ultimate goal for leading AI companies that are driving billions in spending on infrastructure and talent. Scaling laws suggest that the more data and compute an AI model receives, the smarter it becomes.",Google deepmind ceo demis hassabis has once again warned that the present wave of ai startup valuations is unsustainable.
