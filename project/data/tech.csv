This retaliatory move follows Bangladesh's restrictions on Indian yarn and rice. While key items like fish and edible oil are spared, the ban impacts a significant portion of Bangladesh's garment exports to India.

Ban on Bangladesh goods likely to benefit NE

NEW DELHI: In a “retaliatory move”, govt on Saturday restricted the import of several products from Bangladesh, including a ban on the entry of readymade garments through the land route, amid growing unease with the interim administration led by chief adviser Muhammad Yunus.In a notification Saturday, the directorate general of foreign trade, however, allowed garments, the mainstay of Bangladesh industry, to be shipped via Nhava Sheva and Kolkata ports. The latest move will deal a blow to a significant chunk of the $700 million garment exports to India, a large part of which lands up in stores and on e-comm platforms.While fish, edible oil, LPG and crushed stones have been spared, import of several products via land customs stations and integrated check posts in Assam, Meghalaya, Tripura, Mizoram and Changrabandha and Fulbari in West Bengal will be discontinued.Govt sources said the notification by DGFT was retaliatory action against Bangladesh, which last month restricted the entry of Indian yarn, the key input for making apparel, and rice. India had earlier disallowed transit of Bangladesh garments meant for export to third markets as these goods cornered the space on freighters, elbowing out India-made products.“Bangladesh cannot cherry-pick the terms of bilateral engagement solely to benefit itself or take India’s market access for granted. India is willing to discuss these issues but it is Bangladesh’s responsibility to create an environment that is free of rancour,” said an official.Govt sources said industrial growth in the northeastern states had taken a hit because of the imposition of unreasonably high and economically unviable transit charges by Dhaka, even as Bangladesh itself enjoyed free access to the entire northeastern market. Access for manufactured products, barring some farm goods, is also an issue in Bangladesh.“Due to Bangladesh’s landport restrictions, the northeastern states suffer from lack of access to the Bangladesh market to sell locally manufactured goods, restricting market access to primary agricultural goods only,” said a source, adding India’s decision on Saturday will support local manufacturing in the Northeast and India’s Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative .Earlier this week, Yunus had suggested a comprehensive economic plan for Bangladesh, Nepal, Bhutan and the northeastern states. The notification comes days after an alleged “secret visit” by a Chinese team to Lalmonirhat to restore an air base.","India has restricted imports from bangladesh, including a ban on readymade garments via land routes.

Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath warns: ‘India is at the epicentre of the global…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/zerodha-co-founder-and-ceo-nithin-kamath-warns-india-is-at-the-epicentre-of-the-global/articleshow/121185441.cms,"

Here’s what Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath wrote on X (formerly Twitter)

""Here's something worrying from a recent earnings call of a beverage maker: Indian's are consuming more soft drinks than ever. Even Indian companies have said something similar. Remember, India is at the epicentre of the global diabetes epidemic.""

Diabetes is a ticking time bomb for India. We have the largest number of people with diabetes in the world.

There was a time when people used to call diabetes a rich person's disease. But that's no longer the case. According to a recent study, 21 crore Indians are living with diabetes.

Poll Do you believe increasing soft drink consumption is a significant health risk for India? No, I don't think so Yes, it's a serious concern

The scary part is the rate at which it's affecting young Indians. If you're a 20-year-old woman living in a city today, you have a 64.6% chance of developing diabetes during your lifetime. If you're a young man, your risk is also quite high at 55.5%.

But the sad part is there's a lack of awareness among people. About 27.5% of people with diabetes don't even know they have it. Even if they do know, very few people get treatment.

What makes this a serious crisis is that less than 20% of Indians have health insurance. Most Indians end up spending out of their pocket, which is a huge burden for poor and low-income households.

There's no magic bullet to solve this issue. We need multiple approaches, from public awareness campaigns, insurance coverage for the poor and vulnerable, to introducing early detection programs.

Simple lifestyle changes, like adding a few extra minutes of exercise each day or reducing time spent sitting, can make a big difference. Even small changes, such as walking or cycling for an extra five minutes a day, can lower the risk of diabetes.

We've been supporting founders and startups that are working on helping Indians become healthier, but this is a systemic challenge that needs all people involved—from individuals to the government—to take action.

Zerodha co-founder and CEO Nithin Kamath took to microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter) to raise concerns about increasing soft drink consumption in India. In the post, Kamath cited a worrying trend from a beverage maker’s recent earnings. “Indian's are consuming more soft drinks than ever,” he wrote without naming the beverage company. Kamath linked the increased consumption of soft drinks to a broader health issue, pointing out that “India is at the epicentre of the global diabetes epidemic”. Notably, this is the second time when Kamath has warned against rising cases of diabetes in the country. He previously shared a post in November last year, calling Diabetes 'a ticking time bomb for India.'Kamath quoted his previous post which he shared in November last year. He then wrote:","Zerodha co-founder and ceo nithin kamath took to microblogging platform x (formerly twitter) to raise concerns about increasing soft drink consumption in india.

US woman praises India’s 10 best traits on social media

1. Affordable healthcare

2. Extensive and cost-effective public transportation

3. Rich and diverse food culture

4. Strong community and family bonds



5. Culture of resourcefulness and sustainability

6. Affordable and high-quality education

7. Vibrant festivals and cultural celebrations



8. Hard work and resilience

9. Flexible and adaptive labor market

10. Strong social networks and community support



India, a nation known for its rich cultural heritage and rapid economic growth, often surprises foreigners with its unique blend of tradition and modernity. One such admirer is Kristen Fischer , an American expat living in India, who recently highlighted ten practical aspects of Indian life that she believes the country excels at, compared to other parts of the world. In an Instagram video titled ""Things India Does Better,"" Fischer shared her firsthand observations on why India stands out, praising its affordability, strong community support, and cultural vibrancy. Her insights provide a refreshing perspective on the everyday strengths of Indian society that often go unnoticed.India’s healthcare system stands out for its affordability and accessibility, a factor that Fischer highlighted as one of the country’s biggest strengths. Unlike many Western countries where medical treatments can lead to financial strain, India offers high-quality medical services at a fraction of the cost. This affordability extends to everything from routine check-ups to complex surgeries, making healthcare accessible to a larger section of the population.Additionally, India is known for its world-class hospitals and medical professionals, with cities like Chennai, Mumbai, and Delhi emerging as medical tourism hubs. Patients from around the globe often travel to India for treatments like heart surgeries, joint replacements, and cosmetic procedures, drawn by the combination of advanced technology and cost-effectiveness.India boasts one of the world’s largest and most cost-effective public transportation networks. Fischer praised the country’s extensive rail system, which spans over 68,000 kilometers, connecting even the remotest corners of the nation. This network is complemented by affordable buses, autorickshaws, metros, and app-based ride-sharing services, providing convenient travel options for millions every day.For instance, the Delhi Metro, known for its punctuality and cleanliness, has become a model for other cities, while local trains in Mumbai are the lifeline for the city’s bustling workforce. The affordability of these options makes daily commuting more economical compared to many Western countries, where public transport can be significantly more expensive.Indian cuisine is renowned worldwide for its vibrant flavors, rich spices, and immense variety. Fischer noted that India’s diverse food culture is not only delicious but also remarkably affordable. From street food like samosas and chaat to elaborate regional dishes like Rajasthani thalis and Hyderabadi biryani, India offers a gastronomic experience that caters to every palate and budget.Moreover, the widespread use of fresh, locally sourced ingredients and centuries-old cooking techniques contribute to the health benefits and distinct flavors of Indian dishes. India’s food culture also emphasizes hospitality and sharing, reflecting the country’s deeply rooted community values.One of the most distinctive aspects of Indian society is its emphasis on close-knit family structures and strong community ties. Fischer highlighted this as a key strength, noting that Indian families often live together, providing a robust support system for both emotional and financial well-being.In India, it is common for multiple generations to share a household, creating an environment where family members can rely on each other during tough times. This sense of togetherness extends beyond the family unit to include neighbors and local communities, fostering a deep sense of belonging and mutual support.Fischer also praised India’s culture of resourcefulness, where people often repair, reuse, and recycle items rather than discarding them. This mindset minimizes waste and promotes sustainability, reflecting a practical approach to everyday living.In rural areas, this resourcefulness is evident in the widespread use of traditional farming techniques, reliance on locally sourced food, and innovative approaches to water conservation. Urban households, too, are increasingly embracing sustainable practices, from composting to using solar power, driven by a growing awareness of environmental issues.India’s education system, while facing challenges, also stands out for its affordability and quality. Fischer noted that India is home to some of the world’s most prestigious institutions, like the Indian Institutes of Technology (IITs) and the Indian Institutes of Management (IIMs), which offer top-tier education at a fraction of the cost compared to their Western counterparts.This affordability extends to primary and secondary education, where many public and private schools provide high-quality instruction at reasonable fees, making education accessible to a broader population.India’s festivals, known for their color, energy, and inclusivity, are among the most vibrant in the world. Fischer appreciated the way these celebrations bring communities together, fostering a sense of unity and shared joy.From the lights of Diwali and the colors of Holi to the spiritual fervor of Eid and the grandeur of Durga Puja , Indian festivals reflect the country’s deep-rooted traditions and diverse cultural heritage. These celebrations often include family gatherings, community feasts, and elaborate rituals, creating lasting memories for participants.Fischer also highlighted the hardworking nature and resilience of Indians, who show remarkable adaptability in the face of challenges. This resilience is evident in the country’s thriving startup ecosystem, its rapid economic growth, and the determination of its people to overcome adversity.India’s labor market is known for its flexibility, which has fueled the growth of industries like information technology, business process outsourcing (BPO), and manufacturing. This adaptability has made India a global outsourcing hub, attracting companies from around the world seeking cost-effective solutions.Finally, Fischer emphasized the importance of strong social networks in India, where communities often come together to support each other during difficult times. This sense of community is reinforced by cultural values that prioritize relationships and collective well-being.","Us woman praises india’s 10 best traits on social media.

Melinda French Gates’ dream which changed her life

Melinda Gates says she suffered panic attacks

Microsoft founder Bill Gates ex-wife Melinda French Gates has revealed that a recurring dream played an important role in her decision to end her 27-year marriage. The divorce, which was finalised in 2021, followed the surfacing of certain information that impacted the couple's relationship. In a recent interview Melinda French Gates revealed that she experienced recurring nightmares in late 2019. She claimed that the dream turned out be a turning point in her journey.In an interview with enterprenuer Jamie Kern Lima, French Gates described her symbolic dream. Melinda French Gates described that in her dream, she saw that she was standing on a cliff along with Bill Gates and their children. As the dream progressed, the portion of the cliff where she stood began to crumble and break away. This imagery had a profound effect on her, which she interpreted as a clear sign that she needed to separate from Bill and move forward on her own.“I was going to have to make a decision—and I was going to have to make it by myself,” she recalled.""Some dreams will take me years to understand, but if they’re recurring, I know I need to pay attention to them,” added Melinda Gates.While the dream served as a catalyst, Melinda's decision was also influenced by other factors. While she did not disclose specific details, Melinda acknowledged that certain things came out publicly, reinforcing her decision to leave the marriage. She referenced Bill Gates’ past meetings with Jeffrey Epstein, which she described as deeply disturbing. Bill has previously admitted that associating with Epstein was a mistake.In a recent candid interview with The Times, French Gates addressed Bill Gates’ remarks about their divorce. She said, “If you can’t live your values out inside your most intimate relationship, it was necessary.”French Gates also opened up about the emotional strain of the divorce, sharing that she experienced panic attacks throughout the separation. “When you’re leaving a marriage, it’s very, very hard. And the negotiations were tough,” she said.She shared that her first panic attack occurred in 2014 while having lunch with Gates, prompting her to begin therapy. “I’d heard of people having panic attacks and I didn’t know if it was a real thing,” she said.Initially skeptical of therapy, French Gates admitted she later came to understand its value. “It doesn’t mean I’m damaged,” she explained. “It means I’ve been through some difficult things that I need to figure out.”Following the divorce, both Bill and Melinda Gates have continued their philanthropic efforts, though they are no longer working together as a couple. Bill Gates has publicly expressed regret about the divorce, acknowledging his role in the dissolution of their marriage.","Melinda french gates has revealed that a recurring dream played an important role in her decision to end her 27-year marriage to bill gates.

“As part of our ongoing work to make our teams and programs operate more efficiently, and to better align with our product roadmap, we’ve made the difficult decision to eliminate a small number of roles.”

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy’s plan to cut bureaucracy at company

Amazon has reportedly fired 100 employees within its Devices and Services division . According to a report by Reuters, the company said the jobs represented a small number of the total for the unit and were part of its regular business review. The Devices and Services unit is responsible for developing popular hardware products such as the Echo smart speakers, Fire TV devices, and Ring security systems. To recall, Amazon also laid off some employees from Alexa-related jobs in 2023.In a statement given to Reuters, Amazon spokesperson said,While the full scope of the layoffs remains unclear, reports indicate that a variety of teams within the Devices and Services unit have been affected. This suggests a broad restructuring effort rather than targeting a specific product line.The layoffs come as Amazon continues to navigate a challenging economic environment. Like many other tech companies, Amazon has been focused on cost-cutting measures to improve efficiency and profitability. These measures have included workforce reductions across various divisions. Amazon has not yet released an official statement specifying the reasons for this particular round of layoffs.Amazon CEO Andy Jassy told employees that building large teams and personal fiefdoms is not the path to advancement at the company, emphasizing instead that the e-commerce giant rewards those who accomplish more with fewer resources. Jassy's comments came during a recent all-hands meeting as Jassy continues his push to reduce management layers and bureaucracy across the organization.The CEO highlighted Amazon's commitment to operating with the agility of ""the world's largest startup"" despite its size. This initiative includes a recently completed effort to increase the ratio of individual contributors to managers by 15% across the company. Rather than massive layoffs, Amazon achieved this goal by combining teams and moving some managers into individual contributor roles.Jassy also stressed the importance of meritocracy over bureaucracy in Amazon's corporate culture. He mentioned reviewing more than a thousand employee emails sent to a dedicated ""No Bureaucracy"" alias, which has already resulted in 375 process improvements.",Amazon has reportedly fired 100 employees within its devices and services division.

The situation marks a significant escalation in the long-running dispute between the two tech giants over app store policies and digital revenue sharing.Despite a partial legal victory in 2023 that allowed Epic to direct users to its own payment methods, Apple has now blocked a fresh attempt to reinstate Fortnite on its US App Store, according to a statement from the official Fortnite account on X (formerly Twitter). The post read:This new block impacts both US and EU iOS users, effectively making Fortnite inaccessible globally on Apple devices.The conflict between Apple and Epic Games began in August 2020 when Epic introduced a direct payment option in its Fortnite app, bypassing Apple's 30% commission on in-app purchases. This move violated Apple’s App Store guidelines, leading to the immediate removal of Fortnite from the store. Epic responded by filing a lawsuit against Apple, accusing the tech giant of maintaining an illegal monopoly over app distribution and in-app payments.The latest block affects millions of Fortnite players worldwide, as iOS remains one of the largest gaming platforms. Key impacts include:",Apple has blocked fortnite on its us and eu app stores. Epic claims apple has still blocked its attempt to distribute the game via its own store.

In a world driven by technological advancements, the smartphone stands out as one of the most transformative inventions of the 21st century. It has revolutionised communication, reshaped business, and brought the vastness of the internet into the palms of billions. However, alongside these undeniable benefits, smartphones have also introduced a host of psychological, physical, and social challenges that threaten human well-being.Decades ago, Baba Vanga , the enigmatic Bulgarian mystic known for her eerily accurate prophecies, reportedly warned about a small, addictive device that would dominate human lives, leading to widespread mental distress and social decay. As smartphones become ever more entrenched in daily life, her chilling prediction appears more relevant than ever. This article delves into the profound impacts of smartphone addiction, highlighting the health risks, psychological consequences, and societal challenges that echo Vanga's grim vision.Baba Vanga, often referred to as the "" Nostradamus of the Balkans ,"" is known for her unsettlingly accurate prophecies. Among her many predictions, one stands out in the context of modern technology – a warning about humanity’s growing dependence on small electronic devices. Although Vanga made this prediction long before the smartphone era, her vision seems to perfectly capture the modern phenomenon of mobile addiction. She foresaw a future where these devices, initially celebrated for their convenience, would disrupt human relationships, undermine mental health, and alter the fabric of society.Her prediction aligns eerily with the reality of today, where smartphones have become indispensable but potentially dangerous tools, contributing to anxiety, social isolation, and physical health problems.Smartphone addiction is not just a problem for one generation – it spans all age groups, affecting children, teenagers, adults, and even the elderly. This widespread impact reflects Vanga’s prophecy of a technology that would infiltrate every aspect of human life.Children are among the most vulnerable to the effects of excessive smartphone use, as their developing brains are particularly sensitive to digital stimuli. According to a report by the National Commission for Protection of Child Rights (NCPCR) in India, nearly 24% of children regularly use smartphones before bed, a habit that disrupts sleep patterns and cognitive development.Adults are not immune to the lure of smartphones. In fact, they often face even more profound consequences due to the high-pressure environments of work and personal life.The physical and psychological effects of smartphone addiction are severe, often leading to long-term health issues that can be difficult to reverse.The impact of smartphone addiction extends beyond individual health, disrupting social dynamics and weakening family relationships.Given the widespread impact of smartphone addiction, it is crucial to adopt strategies to reduce screen time and restore digital balance.","Baba vanga’s chilling warning about smartphones impacts different age groups.

Apple Pay , one of the world's most widely used digital payment platforms, experienced a significant outage on May 16, 2025, affecting thousands of users across the United States. As per reports, the disruption, which began around 8:00 a.m. Pacific Time left many unable to make transactions, access their digital wallets, or use related services like Apple Cash and Apple Card. While Apple has since restored most of its services, the incident highlights the growing dependency on digital financial systems and the potential challenges they face.The first signs of the outage appeared when thousands of users began reporting issues on the popular outage tracking platform, Down Detector. At its peak, nearly 3,000 reports were logged, indicating a widespread problem affecting Apple Pay, Wallet, Cash, and Card services. Many users also took to social media platforms like X (formerly Twitter), Reddit, and Bluesky to share their frustrations about being unable to complete routine transactions. Apple Pay is not available in India.For nearly two hours, Apple Pay and Wallet remained inaccessible for many, significantly impacting users who rely on the service for daily purchases, transportation, and peer-to-peer payments. This prompted many to seek alternative payment methods, with some noting the inconvenience of being unable to access ride-hailing services like Uber and Lyft, which often depend on Apple Pay for quick transactions.Apple's official status page, which initially showed all systems as operational, eventually confirmed the widespread disruption. The page listed ongoing issues with Apple Pay, Apple Wallet, Apple Card, and Apple Cash, stating that ""some users may be experiencing issues with this service."" This acknowledgment came roughly an hour after the first reports surfaced, reflecting a delayed response to the problem.By late morning, Apple had updated its status page to indicate that Apple Cash and Apple Card services had returned to normal, while Apple Pay and Wallet continued to experience problems. Despite these updates, some users continued to report lingering issues, suggesting that the recovery process was not uniform across all regions or devices.As of 11:11 a.m. Pacific Time, Apple reported that all affected services, including Apple Pay and Wallet, had been restored. However, the company's status page provided no specific details about the cause of the outage or the steps taken to resolve it. Apple has not yet released an official statement addressing the incident, and requests for comment have so far gone unanswered.While the outage appears to be resolved for most users, some have continued to report sporadic connectivity issues, indicating that the recovery may still be ongoing for a subset of the user base. The incident also sparked renewed discussions online about the importance of having backup payment options, especially as digital payment systems become more deeply integrated into daily life.The timing of the outage, occurring on a Friday morning, likely added to the inconvenience for users attempting to pay bills, transfer funds, or make weekend plans. The incident also highlights the broader implications of relying on digital payment systems, which, while convenient, can leave users vulnerable to sudden disruptions.Given the scale and duration of the outage, Apple Pay's temporary unavailability serves as a reminder of the critical role digital payment platforms now play in global commerce. It also underscores the need for robust backup systems and clear communication from service providers when technical issues arise.","Apple pay, one of the world's most widely used digital payment platforms, experienced a significant outage on may 16, 2025.

US President Donald Trump on Saturday told Walmart to “eat the tariffs” after the retail giant warned that it would have to raise prices because of the new import taxes . Trump said that the retail giant should not blame tariffs for the price hikes.The US’s biggest retailer recently said that tariffs, even at reduced levels, would soon force price increases on many of its products. Walmart CEO Doug McMillon explained that while the company would try to keep prices low, it could not “absorb all the pressure” caused by the tariffs.In response, Trump took to his social media platform, Truth Social, to scold Walmart. “Walmart should STOP trying to blame Tariffs as the reason for raising prices throughout the chain,” he wrote. “Walmart made BILLIONS OF DOLLARS last year, far more than expected.”Trump urged Walmart to keep prices down despite the tariffs. “EAT THE TARIFFS,” he said, adding, “I’ll be watching, and so will your customers.”Walmart’s warning comes amid growing concerns over inflation and rising costs, with Trump pushing to keep prices stable as part of his trade policy. About one-third of Walmart’s products come from overseas, with many imported from China and Mexico.The company sells a wide range of affordable goods to millions of Americans and says 90% of the population is its customers, according to the New York Times.Many retailers have avoided raising prices so far by stockpiling goods. Walmart is seen as somewhat protected because many of its groceries are sourced within the United States. However, the company has stopped projecting profits for the current quarter due to the uncertainty caused by tariffs.Walmart reported a sales increase of over 3%, reaching $112 billion in the last quarter, and expects revenue growth of 3% to 4% for the year.

Devagiri and three others were indicted by a federal jury in August and were arrested in October, Federal prosecutors said, earlier this week, that Devagiri has pleaded guilty. Devagiri faces a sentence of up to 20 years in prison and a fine of $250,000. He is scheduled to appear for a status hearing in the case on September 16.Between 2020 and 2021, Devagiri and three others scammed the delivery company.Devagiri used to work as a DoorDash delivery driver. He devised this method, where he used customer accounts to place high-value orders on the app. Then he used an employee's credentials to access DoorDash software and manually reassign the orders to driver accounts that he and his co-conspirators controlled.Then, the fraudulent driver accounts that were in their control reported that the orders were delivered. In reality, those orders were not delivered because those orders were not even real. Then Devagiri used the software to pay the fraudulent drivers for those non-existent deliveries.Then Devagiri used the software to change the orders from ""delivered"" status to ""in process"". ""This procedure usually took less than five minutes, and was repeated hundreds of times for many of the orders,"" the US Attorney's Office said in a statement.Co-defendant Manaswi Mandadapu pled guilty to the same charge on May 6.

Chinese EV battery giant CATL aims to raise $4 billion in Hong Kong IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinese-ev-battery-giant-catl-aims-to-raise-4-bn-in-hong-kong-ipo/articleshow/121092657.cms,"Chinese EV battery giant CATL aims to raise $4 bn in Hong Kong IPO

'Military-linked company'





HONG KONG: Chinese EV battery giant CATL aims to raise $4 billion in its Hong Kong listing scheduled for May 20, said a statement filed to the bourse Monday, making it the largest IPO expected in the city so far this year.A global leader in the sector, CATL produces more than a third of all electric vehicle (EV) batteries sold worldwide, working with major brands including Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen.The company is already listed in Shenzhen, and its plan for a secondary listing in Hong Kong was announced in a December filing with the stock exchange.According to a prospectus filed Monday, CATL will offer approximately 117.9 million units priced at up to HK$263 per share ($33.8) for total expected proceeds of HK$31.01 billion.The listing is set to take place next Tuesday (May 20).Cornerstone investors, including Sinopec and Kuwait Investment Authority, agreed to buy shares worth HK$2.62 billion, the prospectus shows.Founded in 2011 in the eastern Chinese city of Ningde, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (CATL) was initially propelled to success by rapid growth in the domestic market.But the world's largest EV market has more recently begun to show signs of flagging sales amid a broader slowdown in consumption.The trends have fuelled a fierce price war in China's expansive EV sector, putting smaller firms under huge pressure to compete while remaining financially viable.But CATL continues to post solid performances, with its net profit jumping 32.9 percent in the first quarter.Funds raised from a secondary listing could be used to accelerate CATL's overseas expansion, particularly in Europe.The battery giant is building its second factory on the continent in Hungary after launching its first in Germany in January 2023.In December, CATL announced that it would work with automotive giant Stellantis on a $4.3 billion factory to make EV batteries in Spain, with production slated to begin by the end of 2026.Earlier analysts said CATL's float could be a blockbuster initial public offering that could boost Hong Kong's fortunes as a listing hub.Hong Kong's stock exchange is eager for the return of big-name Chinese listings in hopes of regaining its crown as the world's top IPO venue.The Chinese finance hub saw a steady decline in new offerings since Beijing's regulatory crackdown starting in 2020 led some Chinese mega-companies to put their plans on hold.In a list issued in January by the US Defense Department, CATL was designated as a ""Chinese military company"".The United States House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party highlighted this inclusion in letters to two American banks in April, urging them to withdraw from the IPO deal with the ""Chinese military-linked company"".But the two American banks JPMorgan and Bank of America are still on the deal.Beijing has denounced the list as ""suppression"", while CATL denied engaging ""in any military related activities"".According to Bloomberg, CATL plans to make the deal as a ""Reg S"" offering, which doesn't allow sales to US onshore investors, limiting the company's exposure to legal risks in the United States.",Chinese ev battery giant catl aims to raise $4 bn in hong kong ipo.

ZURICH: Swiss firm Climeworks , which has pioneered the direct capture of CO2 using huge industrial fans in Iceland, is holding talks with staff representatives to cut jobs, Swiss television said Friday.The Zurich-based company indicated earlier this week job cuts were coming ""in light of current macroeconomic uncertainty , shifting policy priorities where climate tech is seeing reduced momentum in some areas"" and lack of clarity for its next plant in the United States.US President Donald Trump's administration has moved to gut US government environmental and climate activities and roll back pollution regulations.Climeworks did not say how many jobs would be cut but state broadcaster RTS said on Friday that consultations with staff were under way.It noted the procedure is required when Swiss companies want to cut more than 10 percent of their staff.Climeworks employs nearly 500 people.The company said: ""We find ourselves navigating a challenging time"" and ""we need to be mindful that our funding must be managed with diligence.""It has been operating a facility in Iceland for several years that uses huge industrial fans to suck CO2 from the air and bury it underground.It hopes to launch construction next year of a larger facility in the US state of Louisiana with the aim of drastically reducing the cost of capturing carbon.There have long been concerns about whether carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) technology will prove effective and affordable but it has also spurred controversy over whether it should be part of plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and limit global warming.The fossil fuel industry has long looked at CCS as a technology that would allow use of oil and gas for longer.The Icelandic magazine Heimildin said in an article published on Thursday that the Climeworks facility there is not capturing enough CO2 to offset its own operations.Contacted by AFP, the company said its second-generation unit is still not fully constructed and has not reached its full planned carbon capture capacity.noo/rl/rlp",Swiss firm climeworks is holding talks with staff representatives to cut jobs.
