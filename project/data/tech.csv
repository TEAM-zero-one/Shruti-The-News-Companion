How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification







Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A life certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

What happened to Christian McCaffrey? Why the 49ers RB’s Week 10 numbers sparked renewed discussion about his health status,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/what-happened-to-christian-mccaffrey-why-the-49ers-rbs-week-10-numbers-sparked-renewed-discussion-about-his-health-status/articleshow/125211617.cms,"Christian McCaffrey's performance in Week 10 saw a dip. This was not due to injury but rather strong defensive strategies. Opposing teams are focusing on stopping McCaffrey first. This highlights his crucial role as the offensive engine for the San Francisco Forty-Niners. His struggles indicate the team's other offensive players are facing challenges.

Christian McCaffrey’s slow start in Week 10 raises questions, but this dip says more about defenses than it does his health

More coverage on NFL:

Christian McCaffrey entered Week 10 as one of the few bright spots in a San Francisco 49ers season that has been battered by injuries everywhere else. The expectation for him wasn’t just high, it was almost unfair. With no Jauan Jennings, no Ricky Pearsall, limited doses of George Kittle, and even stretches without Brock Purdy, McCaffrey became the singular engine that kept the Niners relevant in tough stretches.Yet when the team took on the Rams in this divisional test, viewers immediately began to ask if something was wrong. The stat sheet looked foreign to the standard he’s set. Was he hurt? Was something off? Or was the dip simply football reality?McCaffrey has already exploded this season as a premium pass-catching lifeline. He has totaled 626 receiving yards and four touchdowns on 61 receptions and added 596 rushing yards and four touchdowns on 168 carries. Yet the yards-per-carry number, 3.5 — is the one that’s been the most jarring. That’s not scheme regression. That’s not physical decline. That's a defensive obsession.Against Los Angeles, the trend became impossible to ignore. As San Francisco trailed 21-7, McCaffrey had only 14 rushing yards on seven carries and 12 receiving yards on three catches, a line that looked ordinary in a year when he has felt anything but ordinary.It’s important to note: nothing visible suggests new injury flare-ups. Last year’s trip to Germany to see specialists feels like a lifetime ago considering his 2025 availability. This looks like a classic case of a superstar being game-planned out.Defenses aren’t just reacting to McCaffrey, they’re calling entire drives based on stopping him first. When everyone else in the Niners’ offense is either injured, inexperienced, or inconsistent, that muzzling becomes even easier.So no, this Week 10 slow stretch shouldn’t be viewed as a panic signal. If anything, this is the clearest proof yet that McCaffrey is the gravitational force in the offense. When he looks human, it’s usually because everyone else is hurt, not because he is.",Christian mccaffrey's performance in week 10 saw a dip.

Davante Adams Net Worth in 2025: Exploring the contract milestones and smart money moves behind his $45M fortune,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/davante-adams-net-worth-in-2025-exploring-the-contract-milestones-and-smart-money-moves-behind-his-45m-fortune/articleshow/125211569.cms,"Davante Adams' $45 million net worth reflects his consistent on-field production and smart career moves, not just star receiver pay. His contracts with the Packers and Raiders, including a $140 million megadeal, highlight his market value. Beyond football, his real estate investments and Netflix appearance showcase a disciplined approach to building lasting wealth.

Davante Adams’ contracts, earnings and real-world value fuel his $45 million net worth

More coverage on NFL:

Davante Adams’ financial story isn’t just about being paid like a star wide receiver. It’s about how he built a portfolio, reputation, and demand in a league where value can disappear overnight. The NFL has always rewarded playmakers, but it rarely rewards them this consistently. From Palo Alto High to Fresno State to becoming one of the faces of the modern passing era, Adams has never been a storyline guy, he’s been a production guy.That consistency has turned into something far larger than highlight catches. As per Celebrity Net Worth, his 2025 net worth, widely estimated around $45 million, shows how timing, elite execution, brand awareness, and smart career positioning can collide into real wealth.Across every stop; Packers, Raiders, Jets, and now Los Angeles, Davante Adams has shown one consistent thread: he produces on Sundays, and the market always pays for that. A seven-figure rookie deal was simply the beginning. The $58 million Packers extension in 2017 confirmed he wasn’t just Aaron Rodgers’ beneficiary, he was a standalone force.Then came Las Vegas, and the deal that shifted the WR market: a five-year, $140 million megacontract that briefly made him the highest-paid wideout in league history.That number still gets referenced anytime a new WR1 deal shakes the league.He also crossed into mainstream pop-sports culture with Netflix’s “Receiver,” giving fans a look beyond the stat lines. And while Adams is not the splashy brand-publicity type, he’s built a quieter, sturdier financial identity. Real estate was a major signal of that, his reported $11.4 million Las Vegas home is not the impulsive purchase of a reckless star, it’s the move of a man who has already started thinking beyond football.And that’s why his wealth matters in conversation: it isn’t hype-inflated, it’s earned production and disciplined leverage, the kind future WRs will use as precedent.","Davante adams' $45 million net worth reflects his consistent on-field production and smart career moves.

'Don't lecture about Indian literacy rates': American CEO James Fishback's jibe at Vivek Ramaswamy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dont-lecture-about-indian-literacy-rates-american-ceo-james-fishbacks-jibe-at-vivek-ramaswamy/articleshow/125161003.cms,"CEO James Fishback took a veiled dig at Vivek Ramaswamy as he mentioned India, maths olympiad in his recent America First speech.





Azoria CEO and ex-DOGE architect James Fishback took a dig at GOP leader Vivek Ramaswamy without naming him and said Americans should not be apologetic about who they are and nobody should lecture Americans on India's literacy or Chinese maths. Americans won't change their culture for a maths olympiad or for a Chemistry exam, Fishback said as he was giving a speech at Boston University College Republicans. The ex-DOGE architect has emerged as a strong anti-H-1B voice.""We don't want ANYONE lecturing us about Indian literacy rates or Chinese math rates. Cut the crap now. We’re Americans. We’re talented. We’re smart. And no, we’re not giving up church on Sunday for more math tutoring. We’re not skipping Friday Night Lights because there’s a chemistry test to cram for. The second we stop apologizing for who we are, we will start winning again!"" Fishback said.The America First CEO has been pushing for completely stopping the H-1B visa program and said that a foreigner should only come to the US for tourism.Fishback's reference to math tutoring, chemistry test was a jibe at Indian-origin Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy who last year created a major uproar in the H-1B controversy as he attacked American culture to justify the H-1B program.Ramaswamy said American culture worships mediocrity over excellence, celebrates prom queen over math olympiad and hence tech companies need to hire foreign employees as there is a dearth of Americans in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.While Vivek's critique of American culture turned out to be a watershed moment for MAGA, with Vivek becoming sidelined, the H-1B conundrum still persists. The Donald Trump administration has imposed a $100,000 fee on hiring H-1Bs, making it difficult for tech companies to hire from foreign countries. Florida has recently announced a ban on H-1Bs in Florida colleges and universities as Governor Ron DeSantis revealed that instead of special positions, the colleges and universities made foreign hiring for some very basic posts, like a public policy professor from China, a graphic designer from Canada.","Azoria ceo and ex-doge architect james fishback took a dig at gop leader vivek ramaswamy without naming him.

Why conflict over Apple CarPlay Ultra

Apple's Secret 3-Year Plan: A New iPhone Era is Coming!





Ford CEO Jim Farley has joined a list of auto makers who are raising concerns about Apple’s expanding control over in-car systems through its new CarPlay Ultra platform. “We don’t like the execution of Ultra in round one,” Farley told The Verge, adding “I’ve talked to Tim [Cook] many times about this. Ford does not have the right, in our opinion, to disrupt someone’s digital life when they get in their car”.Farley further warned that Apple needs to make a decision on how much it wants to encroach into a vehicle system. “How far do you want the Apple brand to go? Do you want the Apple brand to start the car? Do you want the Apple brand to limit the speed? Do you want the Apple brand to limit access?”, a furious Farley question.“The difference between car companies where you have a software-defined vehicle is not going to be what your sheet metal looks like. It won’t be how powerful your EV motor is. That’s all math. All the cars look nice. It’s going to be this digital experience that says why someone buys this or that,” he further said.Introduced earlier this year, Apple CarPlay Ultra is the latest generation of CarPlay, enabling iPhone users to display car functions like fuel level and speed.Other than mirroring iPhone’s screen, CarPlay also lets drivers control the air conditioning, radio, and driving modes, all from the same screen.Currently, only Aston Martin is the only automaker that has fully integrated CarPlay Ultra into its vehicles. According to a Financial Times report, other automakers, including Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Polestar, Volvo, Renault, and others have no plans to integrate the new system into their cars.But the conflict heated up when General Motors (GM) CEO Mary Barra said the company’s future vehicles will no longer support Apple CarPlay or its Google counterpart, Android Auto.","Ford ceo jim farley has joined a list of auto makers who are raising concerns about apple’s expanding control over in-car systems through its new carplay ultra platform. “we don’t like the execution of ultra in round one,” farley said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125135370,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-30830,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Facebook-parent Meta stunned the Silicon Valley in June this year by announcing a $14.3 billion investment in AI startup — Scale AI. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made this investment to primarily onboard Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang and other top executives of the company. This move by Meta trigged an immediate speculation about the Scale AI’s viability, with major clients like OpenAI, Google, and Elon Musk’s xAI reportedly pausing work with the startup. The industry insiders also felt that the company had been effectively acquired, leaving its future uncertain. However, after almost five months after the investment made by Meta, Scale AI CFO Dennis Cinelli has pushed back this speculation. Speaking to CNBC in an interview, Cinelli said that ‘We are a company that signed some of the best deals we have had in the history of our company, just in the last two or three months. We are not a Zombie.”Emphasising on the fact that Scale AI has signed some of its best deals in recent months, Cinelli told CNBC, “We’re not a zombie company,”. Along with this, he also dismissed the claims that the investment made by Meta was a licensing or acquihire deal.He emphasised that Scale AI is still an independent and completely operational.Founded in 2016, ScaleAI is known for its data-labelling services and custom AI applications for governments and enterprises. Cinelli told CNBC that both the divisions of the company are growing with revenue “well into the nine figures.” He also revealed that Scale AI recently secured two major contracts with the US Department of Defense which value $99 million and $100 million in August and September, respectively.Scale AI fired about 14% of its workforce in July, soon after Meta made the investment of $14.3 billion, but the company started the process of hiring and has hired 200 new employees. Along with this, the AI company is also working on expansion and is opening new offices in New York, Washington D.C., St. Louis, and London. Despite alls this, the San Francisco still remains the largest hub of the company where it is occupying 180,000 square feet of former Airbnb space.The departure of Alexandr Wang from the company was considered to a major loss. He was the world’s youngest self-made billionaire until October but Cinelli insists the “vast majority” of employees remain. Facebook-parent Meta now owns 49% stake in ScaleAIwhich is valued around $29 billion, but the company has no voting power or product integration. “Scale’s data business has grown every month since the Meta deal, and its applications business has doubled in the second half of 2025 compared with the first half. Scale expects the applications unit to be the primary revenue driver for the company in the future,” Cenelli told CNBC.",Scale ai cfo pushes back: “we are alive and well” facebook-parent meta made a $14.3 billion investment in ai startup scale ai.

US Shutdown Triggers Massive Political War, Trump Mulls Mass Layoffs; Dems Call Move 'Dirty Trick'





Online job search platform Indeed is reportedly eliminating a very small number of roles, Business Insider reports. The latest job cuts come four months after the company announced to lay off over 100 employees in July earlier this year. The BI report quotes a statement from Indeed where it says “To better align our team structure with business priorities, we've reorganized several functions and made the difficult decision to eliminate a very small number of roles”.However, no details about the roles impacted are known yet.As part of an ongoing restructuring effort by its parent company – Japan’s Recruit Holdings, Indeed has reduced its global workforce to around 11,000 employees. As mentioned above, in July, Indeed and its sister company Glassdoor together laid off about 1,300 employees. The cuts then mainly affected the US-based teams working in research, people operations, and sustainability.In an internal email to staff at the time, Recruit Holdings and Indeed CEO Hisayuki “Deko” Idekoba said, “AI is changing the world” and stressed the need for the company to evolve quickly. “Delivering on this ambition requires us to move faster, try new things, and fix what's broken,” Idekoba wrote. “To achieve our company priorities, it requires creating a structure and culture to support them.”This marks the second round of layoffs at Indeed in two years. In May 2024, the company had already let go of around 1,000 employees, or about 8% of its workforce at the time.","The online job search platform indeed is reportedly eliminating a very small number of roles.

University of Pennsylvania cyber attack: Data worth million exposed





The University of Pennsylvania has confirmed that hackers gained access to several of its internal systems linked to development and alumni activities, stealing confidential data in the process, reports BleepingComputer. The breach, discovered on October 31, occurred after attackers obtained employee credentials through a social engineering scam.""Penn employs a robust information security program; however, access to these systems occurred due to a sophisticated identity impersonation commonly known as social engineering,"" the university said in a statement.The university said its staff quickly locked down the affected systems to stop further intrusions but not before an “offensive and fraudulent email” was sent to members of the Penn community.The university further revealed that it has alerted the FBI and is working with cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike to investigate the incident.According to BleepingComputer’s report, the attackers accessed Penn’s Salesforce donor database, SharePoint files, and other platforms, stealing around 1.71 GB of data. This includes sensitive personal and financial information of alumni and donors such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email IDs, and donation histories.The hackers claimed to have obtained records of roughly 1.2 million donors, including details like “gift histories, wealth ratings, and lifetime commitment amounts.” They also said they sent a mass email to nearly 700,000 people after discovering their access was revoked.The attackers told BleepingComputer that the breach wasn’t politically motivated but aimed at Penn’s “vast, wonderfully wealthy donor database.” However, their communications also included sharp criticism of the university’s diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.The university says it is now strengthening its security systems, conducting staff training on social engineering, and enhancing monitoring tools.Once the probe concludes, Penn plans to notify affected individuals. The university has also urged students, alumni, and donors to stay alert for suspicious emails or phone calls that could be phishing attempts.","University of pennsylvania has confirmed that hackers gained access to several of its internal systems linked to development and alumni activities.

Elon Musk Becomes First Man To Have $500 Billion Wealth





Jack Dorsey, Twitter co-founder and former CEO, has shared a post supporting proposed $1 trillion pay package for Tesla CEO Elon Musk . Voicing his support, Dorsey wrote in a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter): “.”Jack Dorsey quoted a previous Tesla post dated September 18. It said:.”Elon Musk acknowledged and replied to Jack Dorsey's post with a heart emoji.In September this year, the Tesla board proposed a $1 trillion compensation plan for CEO Elon Musk. The newly proposed award is roughly 18 times the size of the 2018 pay package. At its Novermber 6 annual general meeting, Tesla shareholders approved the pay with a strong majority of 75%.In a filing with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) then, the company said that “traditional compensation packages granted to executives at other companies were determined to not be appropriate for designing Mr.Musk’s incentive compensation.”Notably, the new pay package comes with a condition – 10 million active FSD subscriptions for Tesla and 1 million Tesla robotaxis on the road. FSD, as explained in the SEC filing “means an advanced driving system, regardless of the marketing name used, that is capable of performing transportation tasks that provide autonomous or similar functionality under specified driving conditions”.","Jack dorsey, twitter co-founder and former ceo, has shared a post supporting proposed $1 trillion pay package for tesla ceo elon musk.

Sam Altman says ‘Slack creates a lot of fake work’; Elon Musk responds: ‘As I was saying …’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sam-altman-says-slack-creates-a-lot-of-fake-work-elon-musk-responds-as-i-was-saying-/articleshow/125213230.cms,"



Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reacted sharply to Sam Altman ’s remarks about office productivity tools like Slack, saying that the ChatGPT-maker OpenAI will “compete directly with Microsoft”. Sam Altman, founder and CEO of OpenAI recently said that while there are many positives about Slack, it also creates a “lot of fake work”. In a now viral clip, Altman about how current workplace tools — such as Slack, Google Docs, email, and PowerPoint — may soon be replaced by a new generation of AI-driven systems.“There are positives about Slack,” Altman said, “but I kind of dread the first hour of the morning or last time before I go to bed, where I’m just dealing with this explosion of Slack. It creates a lot of fake work.”Altman added that he believes a new kind of AI-powered productivity platform is within reach — one where “your AI agent and my AI agent” will handle most communication and tasks, escalating only when necessary.Elon Musk, who has long been critical of OpenAI’s close partnership with Microsoft, responded on X (formerly known as Twitter) with a pointed remark: “As I was saying, OpenAI will compete directly with Microsoft.”The exchange comes as AI companies race to redefine workplace productivity. While Microsoft has heavily invested in “Copilot” features across its apps, Altman’s comments suggest OpenAI could be developing its own tools that may compete in the same space.In a recent post shared on X, Altman suggested that the company is planning another major new business venture, putting it in direct competition with cloud technology giants, including Google, Amazon and Microsoft.Altman wrote in the post: “We are also looking at ways to more directly sell compute capacity to other companies (and people); we are pretty sure the world is going to need a lot of 'AI cloud', and we are excited to offer this.”This means OpenAI could soon start selling cloud services, putting it in competition with established providers such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud. In September, OpenAI Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Sarah Friar made a similar point, suggesting that cloud providers had been “learning on our dime.” Her comment indicated that OpenAI was looking to safeguard its AI expertise from technology companies that may use its developments to advance their own capabilities.","Sam altman, founder and ceo of openai recently said that while there are many positives about slack, it also creates a “lot of fake work” tesla ceo elon musk has reacted sharply to altman’s remarks about office productivity tools like slack, saying that the chatgpt-maker openai will “compete directly with microsoft”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125213222,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-28312,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

What other activities are planned?



Australia leads the world in banning social media for children







The Danish government has reached an agreement to implement a minimum age requirement of 15 years old on certain social media platforms, it announced on Friday.The move follows Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen's call for restrictions on children's use of social media in her opening speech to Parliament last month, due to concerns over youth mental health. A majority of parties in parliament said they would support the plan.""As one of the first countries in the EU, Denmark is now taking a groundbreaking step towards introducing age limits on social media,"" said the country's digitalization ministry in a statement. ""This is done to protect children and young people in the digital world.""""As a starting point, children under the age of 15 should not have access to platforms that may expose them to harmful content or harmful features,"" the statement said.The ministry did not specify which social media platforms are affected or how the ban will be enforced.However, exceptions can be made if parents believe their child should have access to social media at an earlier age. According to the statement, parents will have the opportunity to consent to their children's access, if their children are as young as 13.The agreement also envisages allocating 160 million Danish kroner (€21.4 million; $24.8 million) to 14 initiatives aimed at strengthening the protection of children and young people online and creating a better framework for their digital lives.As part of the agreement, EU's Digital Services Act supervision will be strengthened, and funds will be allocated to support the development of alternative social media platforms. Additionally, extra efforts will be made to combat illegal marketing by influencers, the statement mentioned.A coalition of lawmakers ""are making it clear that children should not be left alone in a digital world where harmful content and commercial interests are too much a part of shaping their everyday lives and childhoods,"" the ministry said.""Children and young people have their sleep disrupted, lose their peace and concentration, and experience increasing pressure from digital relationships where adults are not always present,"" it said. ""This is a development that no parent, teacher or educator can stop alone.""""Denmark is now leading the way in Europe with a national age limit for social media and a concerted effort to strengthen the digital wellbeing of children and young people,"" Digitalization Minister Caroline Stage said.""We are taking a necessary stand against a development where large tech platforms have had free rein in children's rooms for far too long.""This Danish plan follows Australia's lead. In December, Australia is set to become the first country to ban social media for children, setting the minimum age at 16.In September, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told a United Nations forum in New York that she was ""inspired"" by Australia's ""common sense"" decision to enact age restrictions.The legislation subjects social media platforms to fines of up to 50 million Australian dollars (€30 million; $32.3 million) for allowing children under 16 to create accounts.On Wednesday, Australia announced that it had added the message board Reddit and the livestreaming service Kick to its list of social media platforms that must prohibit children under 16 from having accounts.These platforms will join Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, X, and YouTube in facing a world-first legal obligation to shut down accounts belonging to younger Australian children on December 10, according to Communications Minister Anika Wells.","Denmark to introduce minimum age requirement of 15 on certain social media platforms.

Shein sparks outrage over 'childlike' sex doll







Singapore-based online retailer Shein is not to be subject to a ban in France during a probe into the sale of illegal items, France's government announced on Friday.""The government has succeeded in getting Shein to remove all illegal products that were being sold on its platform,"" Paris said in a statement.The French government said that the firm remained ""under close observation by state authorities.""It stressed that legal proceedings initiated against the company are to continue.The government's assessment found that no illegal products such as child pornography, stabbing weapons or certain medicines were being sold on the platform.The company was founded in Nanjing, China, in 2008 and moved its headquarters to Singapore in 2022.The platform caused an uproar in France after it was found to have been advertising ""childlike"" sex dolls. In response, Shein said it had sanctioned the seller and banned the sale of sex dolls on its platform, while also temporarily suspending all third-party listings.France had also called upon the European Union to sanction the retailer over the listing of the dolls.On Wednesday, France's government took steps to ban Shein unless it complies with existing regulations.On the same day, Shein opened its first permanent brick-and-morter shop in Paris' iconic BHV Marais department store, which was met with a petition against the opening that garnered over 120,000 signatures.In a separate probe, the European Union and national consumer authorities are investigating the firm's marketing practices, which they allege are in breach of EU consumer law.Shein has also received criticism from environmental groups over its reliance on fast-fashion.","Singapore-based online retailer shein is not to be subject to a ban in france during a probe into the sale of illegal items.
