garib nawaz

I have been immersed in the study of the Upanishads and the Bhagavad Gita and many related scriptures over the last 10 years with a very good teacher. And what I found is that despite it being such an integral part of our heritage, I had no idea about the level of literary, poetic and value systems that I was being exposed to. I also found that there were some really beautiful connections that I was able to make in my training in Indian classical music and in parts of my life. It started out as a sort of a letter to my son, who’s now 24 but at the time was about 17-18, and ended up as a book.Rereading the book, I realised that it has a slightly simple quality. But it was honestly because I was addressing a young boy... I think that we do unwittingly tend to have a certain intellectual elitism. Human beings are, I think, inherently taught to other...We've been raised in a very competitive, capitalist world... I have come from a place of being a very high achiever; and so there was a tendency for me to just feel like I was in some ways superior.But now I'm very clear that whether it's a farmer or a writer or a person cleaning the house or the person who drives the train — they are absolutely equally important and interconnected in their particular context. So I think that tone has come into this book.I remember my music teacher telling me her teacher had once said, let one side of yourself surprise the other. And I love that idea because I hate the kind of silos that we've all put ourselves into, whether it’s personally or even in geopolitics. It's become such a strangely polarised world, and everyone has facets of different things within them. So I never consider myself to be too serious, too light, too maternal, too professional. You play the role that is required of you at the time... And even in spaces of friendship, I find that I'm a little more engaged than I was because I treat every aspect of my life with a certain meditative quality now. I'm monotasking more than multitasking.I've found that the study of this literature has helped me live a more fulfilling, a less anxiety-ridden life. Not to mention, the literary merit of some of these texts are mind-blowing. We know the politics of religion has made many of us very wary... In a very sly way, I'm also kind of trying to extract something very beautiful that has gotten a bit distorted, a bit appropriated.The most interesting thing for me is the fact that this in no way requires you to change your lifestyle; to start waking up at 4 in the morning and meditating; to stop certain things that you do. This in no way has anything prescriptive or instructive. All it does is change a certain lens with which you approach life, yourself and everything around you... You have a certain lightness of being, a certain humility, a certain unselfing of the self that you thought you were. You're not trapped in that version of the self, that pressure to prove something.Anyone who tries to other is actually not even talking about Hinduism because everything about Hinduism is that all that is here is one. So where is the question of the other? Instead of going and finding the source, we've started just bashing each other... I think the minute human beings come in, we cause chaos. But when you go back to the essence of the original text and the Upanishads... They use different kinds of metaphors that just make it logical to believe that, yes, we all come from mud and return to mud. And these ideas that we've heard in songs of Kumar Gandharva, the idea of ‘Nirakar’ or when Channulal Mishra sings the ‘Ramcharitmanas’, it's all there. The essence is very much the idea of unity and oneness. But it's gone into all its different territories and contexts and time periods.I've never really engaged much with that noise because it's a pointless cacophony. It's not like there's anyone actually paying attention and trying to understand. I also believe that things are not in a vacuum. And so when we are in a current sort of dispensation and dealing with really divisive forces, it's come from somewhere. It's perhaps come from a post-colonial India, which is now trying to reassert itself and it’s coming out in this crass way. And by attempting to offer one small, elegant way of saying what I think... it's like decolonising that. But not trying to say we are better, nothing is better or worse. If I had grown up in Italy, I may have been studying Christianity. Sometimes I read Augustine and St Francis of Assisi. They're saying the exact same thing. He talks about, I think, the invisible human footprint of unity. I happen to be born Hindu in India. I've been watching Ram Leela since I was a child. I've been exposed to these texts. I've learned Indian classical music, which is honestly an expression of this philosophy. It's got the same ideas. The cyclical quality, the idea of abstraction beyond the human being, the authorlessness. And they all come from a certain way of thinking — what I call our spiritual superpower.I was so astounded when I heard that that Tulsidas in the ‘Ramcharitmanas’ used Urdu phrases like. Because his whole idea was to have it be available to many more people. Honestly it sounds like we've been syncretic forever, it's idiotic to believe that we're not. And even today I've noticed that, even if a person may say something, they're actually living something else... Like how people pray to a tree or a river. Why they have a Tulsi plant in their angan. How my mother used to paint these wayside shrines. You see it all over India where you have a stone and you smear tangerine on it. Put some flowers over there and suddenly it becomes Hanumanji or a totem towards something larger than ourselves. And that idea is so beautiful, it's so ambient, it's so non-claustrophobic. Music is another way in which people express themselves... I honestly haven’t found such an extraordinary coming together of the intellectual, the aesthetic, the spiritual and even the magic realism that we all applaud in literature. Some of these mythologies are tapping into parts of ourselves and the universe and that idea beyond time and space that even physicists talk about. They're not just quaint little stories. As Joseph Campbell says, they're going into those parts of oneself that we don't know how to otherwise reach.","Tangerine was written as a letter to her son when he was 17-18 years old. The author has been studying the bhagavad gita for the last 10 years. Tangerine is a novel of love, loss and redemption. I've found that the study of this literature has helped me live a more fulfilling, a less anxiety-ridden life.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125111037,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-37042,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification







Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation, this process has become simpler and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate. Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity.Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A life certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

Everything to know about Haley Kalil who opens up about intimacy struggles that ended her marriage

More entertainment NFL stories from the author:

Sports Illustrated model and influencer Haley Kalil has finally spoken out about her marriage to former NFL player Matt Kalil — and her candid confession has left fans stunned. During a recent Twitch livestream with internet personality Marlon, Haley opened up about what really led to their breakup after nearly seven years of marriage. The two tied the knot in 2015 and officially divorced in 2022, but until now, the real cause behind their split had remained private.The 31-year-old model didn’t shy away from being honest, revealing that the biggest issue in their marriage was a deeply personal one. “We were trying to do the damn thing and [putting in work in their marriage],” Haley said before she typed something on her phone that wasn’t meant for the livestream and showed Marlon. From the context, it appeared that the couple faced physical incompatibility — an issue that, according to Haley, was impossible to overcome.Haley went on to admit that she and Matt did everything possible to make their marriage work. “Deadass… for our whole marriage, deadass. But I was going to try it all. We tried it all: therapist, doctors. Not even lying… Looked up lipo-type s–t… That’s why it’s kinda funny. It’s like my life is a comedy, and it kinda writes itself,” she said with a mix of humor and honesty.“That was the biggest factor… Love him, but he’s my homie… No, because he’s like .01 percent of the population. We’ve tried, impossible unless you’re going to be in tears type s–t,” Haley added, hinting that their intimacy issues became the ultimate reason for parting ways.Despite the uncomfortable revelation, Haley emphasized that the separation was amicable. “We were really chill people,” she said, explaining that they shared a lawyer during the divorce and remained on good terms. “He’s a really good person,” she added. “He made me want to be a better person.”Haley Kalil’s journey from science scholar to social media sensation is as inspiring as it is unexpected. The Minnesota native, who once wore the Miss Minnesota Teen USA crown in 2010, went on to graduate from St. Cloud State University with a perfect 4.0 GPA, earning degrees in biomedical sciences and psychology. But her ambitions stretched far beyond the lab. After being named Miss Minnesota USA in 2014, she took her first major step into the modeling world, later appearing in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue in 2018.Haley is a popular social media influencer and has garnered 9.3 million followers on Instagram and nearly 16 million on TikTok. She was married to former NFL star Matt Kalil from 2015 to 2022. Before that, she dated Brazilian model Kyle Viera, calling their breakup “amicable.” Over time, she’s appeared on covers of Glamour and Grazia, captivating audiences worldwide. Recently, Haley addressed rumors about Austin Butler, saying she’d “be open to seeing where things go. .. if she ever had the chance.”Since their divorce, both have moved on. Matt married model Keilani Asmus in April 2024, while Haley, who was featured as a rookie in Sports Illustrated Swimsuit in 2019, briefly dated Brazilian model Kyle Vieira. Today, Haley continues to build her career as a social media star, turning heads at major events — including Heidi Klum’s Halloween bash in New York City — and proving she’s moved on with grace and confidence.Their story, though personal, sheds light on how even high-profile relationships can face private battles that fame can’t fix.",Haley kalil has finally spoken out about her marriage to former nfl player matt kalil.

RAJKOT: A shocking cybercrime has rocked India’s digital security landscape, with hackers stealing at least 50,000 CCTV clips over nine months from facilities across the country and selling them online for anything between Rs 700 and Rs 4,000 per clip, feeding them into an international porn fetish network for profit.Investigators revealed that 80 CCTV dashboards were compromised, spanning hospitals, schools, corporate offices, factories, cinema halls, and even private residences across cities including Pune, Mumbai, Nashik, Surat, Ahmedabad, Delhi, and more.The scam came to light when teaser clips from Payal Maternity Hospital in Rajkot appeared on YouTube channels like “Megha Mbbs” and “cp monda”, leading customers to Telegram groups where the stolen footage was sold.Officials said the breaches were made possible by default passwords such as “admin123”, enabling hackers to launch automated attacks and collect massive amounts of sensitive footage.Despite the primary arrests being made earlier in 2025, investigators found that these illegally obtained clips were still available on Telegram groups until at least June.Investigators found that many of these CCTV systems still used factory-set passwords like ‘admin123’, which had not been changed during setup.This enabled the hackers to initiate an aggressive and automated assault.An officer from the cybercrime branch in Ahmedabad told TOI: “The primary method used was a ‘brute force attack’ (hackers using a program or bot to try every possible combination of letters and numbers for a lock).” Parit Dhameliya, the lead hacker in the operation, a BCom graduate, employed three different software programs to achieve this.“First, Dhameliya used a website called suIP.biz to obtain the IP addresses (the unique online location) of cameras in Gujarat. These IPs were then fed into a software called ‘Masscan’ which quickly scanned for open ports (the specific digital doorways that allow remote communication).”Next, the attackers used a specialized hacking tool called ‘SWC software’, which can reveal a camera’s ID, password, and IP address once the system is compromised. Using these stolen credentials, another accused, Rohit Sisodiya — later arrested in Delhi and who had posed as a medical laboratory technology diploma holder — accessed the hospital’s cameras through the DMSS application, a tool normally used for legitimate remote viewing.The officer added, “To access this sensitive footage cost around Rs 700 per person, though the highest-demand voyeuristic clips sold for up to Rs. 4,000. Praj Patil, also a NEET aspirant, acted as the financial facilitator, providing his mobile number and bank account to collect subscription payments.”To conceal their location, the attackers relied heavily on international infrastructure, routing their activities through virtual private networks (VPNs) that made their origins appear to be in cities like Bucharest in Romania, and New York in the US.The massive scale of unauthorized access — exceeding 11,000 successful external sessions in total — was meticulously tracked through log files spanning from Jan 2024 through early Dec 2024. The core members, including Prajwal Teli, Praj Patil, and Chandraprakash Phoolchand, were arrested within 39 hours of the FIR being registered. The threat actors were charged under several sections of the BNS Act and IT Act, including cyber terrorism.","80 cctv dashboards were compromised, spanning hospitals, schools, corporate offices, factories, cinema halls, and even private residences across cities including pune, mumbai, nashik, surat, ahmedabad, delhi, and more.

China has shut Nvidia out

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Nvidia CEO praises Donald Trump





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang came to Washington with a message for the Donald Trump administration. Speaking at he first Nvidia developers' conference, Nvidia CEO cautioned the US government that America cannot win the AI battle if the world, if China fully excludes Nvidia from its vast developer ecosystem. Highlighting Beijing's effective shutdown of Nvidia's operations in the world's second-largest economy, Huang urged US policymakers to reconsider restrictions that could result in Nvidia cede half the planet's AI talent to domestic rivals.""They've made it very clear that they don't want Nvidia to be there right now,"" Huang said at a news conference during the GTC event, revealing that Nvidia has not even applied for U.S. export licenses for its latest chips to China due to the hostile stance from Beijing. ""I hope that will change in the future because I think China is a very important market."" He argued that a policy isolating America from China's developers ""hurts us more"" in the long term, potentially squandering Nvidia's role in powering global AI infrastructure.This is not the first time that Jensen Huang has spoken about the company's falling market share in China.Speaking at a Citadel Securities event in New York earlier this month, Huang revealed that Nvidia is completely barred from selling its high-performance AI chips, including the A100, H100, and H200 models, to Chinese companies since restrictions began in 2022. He said that he has seen Nvidia's dominance in China’s advanced chip market vanish, with its market share dropping from 95% to Zero due to stringent US export controls.Despite the Chinese blockade -- exacerbated by the US export controls that have changed under successive US administrations -- Nvidia reported $500 billion in bookings for advanced chips and announced seven new supercomputers for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The largest, built with Oracle and featuring 100,000 Blackwell chips, will support nuclear weapons maintenance, fusion energy research, and other national priorities.Jensen Huang credited Trump's ""America First"" policies with revitalizing U.S. manufacturing, noting Nvidia's chip production in Arizona via TSMC, server assembly in Texas, and networking gear in California. ""Putting the weight of the nation behind pro-energy growth completely changed the game,"" he said, thanking Trump directly.The DOE deals underscore Nvidia's pivot to fortified US ties amid China's rejection. Analyst Blake Anderson of Carson Group estimated one supercomputer, ""Solstice,"" could involve $3–4 billion in Nvidia chips alone, though federal discounts may apply from the standard $30,000–$40,000 per Blackwell unit. Huang balanced praise for President Trump who is touring Asia ahead of a Thursday meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, where Nvidia's chips may feature prominently -- with pleas for market access.Trump initially tightened export bans on China-specific AI chips in his second term but reversed in July. Huang has long contended that barring Nvidia from ~$50 billion in annual Chinese sales hampers U.S. R&D funding, even as Chinese developers reportedly still prefer Nvidia over mandated Huawei alternatives.Beyond government wins, Huang unveiled expansions to offset China losses: A $1 billion investment for 2.9% stake in Nokia, plus the ""Arc"" product line to boost 6G base station efficiency for millions of sites globally.","China has shut nvidia out of its vast developer ecosystem, ceo jensen huang said.

We are continuing to monitor for any further issues,” the company initially stated. About an hour later, the platform confirmed that the issue “has been resolved,” restoring service to affected users globally.The Reddit outage is the latest in a series of service disruptions across the technology sector.Recently, a massive outage in the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing network caused widespread issues, hitting several major applications, including Reddit. That incident, which occurred on October 20, briefly disrupted a third of the internet after a Domain Name System (DNS) error at AWS’s Northern Virginia data center compromised the ability of apps to access their data.Additionally, Microsoft's Azure network also faced an outage last month that affected several websites, services and apps including Microsoft 365, Xbox and NatWest.Microsoft's Azure status page later confirmed problems with Azure Portal access. On its status page, Azure's network infrastructure was showing as “critical” in every region in the world, underscoring the global scale of the problem.Microsoft said it believed the outage was a result of ""an inadvertent configuration change"", and that it planned to remedy the situation by rolling the service back to a recent backup known to be functioning correctly.","Reddit experienced an outage in several countries, including the us and india.

Scale AI CFO pushes back: “We are alive and well”





Mark Zuckerberg unveils three new Meta AI smart glasses

Business is still booming





Moving ahead without Alexandr Wang





Facebook-parent Meta stunned the Silicon Valley in June this year by announcing a $14.3 billion investment in AI startup — Scale AI. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made this investment to primarily onboard Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang and other top executives of the company. This move by Meta trigged an immediate speculation about the Scale AI’s viability, with major clients like OpenAI, Google, and Elon Musk’s xAI reportedly pausing work with the startup. The industry insiders also felt that the company had been effectively acquired, leaving its future uncertain. However, after almost five months after the investment made by Meta, Scale AI CFO Dennis Cinelli has pushed back this speculation. Speaking to CNBC in an interview, Cinelli said that ‘We are a company that signed some of the best deals we have had in the history of our company, just in the last two or three months. We are not a Zombie.”Emphasising on the fact that Scale AI has signed some of its best deals in recent months, Cinelli told CNBC, “We’re not a zombie company,”. Along with this, he also dismissed the claims that the investment made by Meta was a licensing or acquihire deal.He emphasised that Scale AI is still an independent and completely operational.Founded in 2016, ScaleAI is known for its data-labelling services and custom AI applications for governments and enterprises. Cinelli told CNBC that both the divisions of the company are growing with revenue “well into the nine figures.” He also revealed that Scale AI recently secured two major contracts with the US Department of Defense which value $99 million and $100 million in August and September, respectively.Scale AI fired about 14% of its workforce in July, soon after Meta made the investment of $14.3 billion, but the company started the process of hiring and has hired 200 new employees. Along with this, the AI company is also working on expansion and is opening new offices in New York, Washington D.C., St. Louis, and London. Despite alls this, the San Francisco still remains the largest hub of the company where it is occupying 180,000 square feet of former Airbnb space.The departure of Alexandr Wang from the company was considered to a major loss. He was the world’s youngest self-made billionaire until October but Cinelli insists the “vast majority” of employees remain. Facebook-parent Meta now owns 49% stake in ScaleAIwhich is valued around $29 billion, but the company has no voting power or product integration. “Scale’s data business has grown every month since the Meta deal, and its applications business has doubled in the second half of 2025 compared with the first half. Scale expects the applications unit to be the primary revenue driver for the company in the future,” Cenelli told CNBC.",Scale ai cfo pushes back: “we are alive and well” facebook-parent meta made a $14.3 billion investment in ai startup scale ai.

CEO Satya Nadella bets on Microsoft’s year-long AI transition before expanding workforce again



Microsoft’s cost-cutting strategy delivers record margins as stock climbs above $500







Microsoft will resume hiring after forcing its 228,000-strong workforce through a year-long AI training period, CEO Satya Nadella announced, marking the first clear timeline for ending a hiring freeze that has seen over 15,000 employees cut in 2025 alone.The tech giant laid off 9,000 workers in July—its largest single round of cuts this year—followed by thousands more eliminated in January, May, and June as Nadella pushes employees to ""unlearn and relearn"" their jobs using AI tools before he'll approve new hires. The workforce purge represents a stunning reversal from fiscal 2022, when Microsoft expanded headcount by 22% in a pre-ChatGPT hiring spree.""I will say we will grow our headcount, but the way I look at it is, that headcount we grow will grow with a lot more leverage than the headcount we had pre-AI,"" Nadella told investor Brad Gerstner on the BG2 podcast that aired in early November.Nadella explained that the hiring pause isn't permanent—it's a strategic transition period allowing workers to fundamentally reshape how they perform their roles using AI. Employees need time to integrate tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and GitHub Copilot into their daily workflows before the company expands again.""It's the unlearning and learning process that I think will take the next year or so, then the headcount growth will come with max leverage,"" he said, comparing the shift to how email and Excel spreadsheets revolutionised workplace productivity decades ago.The CEO shared an example of a Microsoft networking executive who, facing massive data center expansion needs, built AI agents to handle maintenance tasks instead of hiring additional staff. ""That is an example of a team with AI tools being able to get more productivity,"" Nadella noted.Despite the layoffs weighing heavily on Nadella personally—he addressed employee concerns in a July memo—investors have rewarded Microsoft's cost-cutting approach. The stock surged above $500 for the first time in July, and the company recently reported its widest operating margin since 2002 alongside 12% year-over-year revenue growth.Microsoft previously implemented selective hiring freezes in its U.S. consulting division in January 2025 and during the COVID-19 pandemic, though strategic areas like Azure cloud services continued recruiting throughout those periods.The company now expects all work to begin with AI integration. ""Right now, any planning, any execution, starts with AI. You research with AI, you think with AI, you share with your colleagues,"" Nadella explained.","Microsoft will resume hiring after forcing its 228,000-strong workforce through a year-long ai training period.

"IBM Layoffs: IBM to cut thousands of jobs, here’s what the company said",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ibm-to-cut-thousands-of-jobs-heres-what-the-company-said/articleshow/125103243.cms,"IBM’s strategic shift towards AI and software







IBM has announced that it will layoff thousand of employees from its global workforce in the fourth quarter in 2025. As reported by CNBC, this latest round of job cuts of the company will impact thousands of employees as the company continues to move towards high-margin software and artificial intelligence services. “In the fourth quarter we are executing an action that will impact a low single-digit percentage of our global workforce,” an IBM spokesperson told CNBC. “While this may impact some U.S.-based roles, we anticipate that our U.S. employment will remain flat year over year.”IBM has the global headcount of approximately 2,70,000 employees at the end of 2024, so if the company plans even to layoff 1% of its employees then it will impact around 2,700 employees.The upcoming round of layoffs comes as part of IBM’s broader organisational realignment under CEO Arvind Krishna. The software giant is now sharpening its focus on AI-driven cloud services and software as both the areas have shown strong growth. In its recent earnings report, IBM posted better-than-expected results, driven by a 10% increase in software revenue.A report by The Wall Street Journal revealed that earlier this year, IBM eliminated job roles in marketing and communications and also replaced around 200 human resources positions with AI agents.The company has since redirected hiring efforts toward sales and software development roles.This latest move by IBM mirrors the current trend in the tech industry, where companies are laying off staff in order to streamline operations and also boost productivity. Last month, e-commerce major Amazon announced its plans to cut 14,000 corporate jobs, whereas Facebook-parent Meta said that it would eliminated 600 roles in its AI division.Despite the layoffs, IBM still maintains its workforce in the US will remain stable year-over-year, suggesting that the job cuts may be more concentrated in international markets or non-core business units.While IBM has not yet disclosed the departments and regions affected by the upcoming job cuts, but emphasised that the restructuring is part of a long-term strategy to align its workforce with emerging growth areas. “We routinely review our workforce and at times rebalance accordingly,” the company said in a statement.",Ibm has announced that it will layoff thousand of employees from its global workforce in the fourth quarter in 2025.

Citigroup has a buy rating on Bharti Airtel with the target price at Rs 2,225. Analysts said the telecom services major had a steady July Sept quarter (Q2FY26), with India mobile, homes, and business segments all modestly above expectations. They said India mobile revenue and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA) grew 2.5-4% on the quarter (QoQ) that was ahead of estimates, with slightly higher ARPUs offsetting slightly lower subscriber additions. Homes revenue and EBITDA both grew ~8.5%, both ahead of estimates, driven by robust subscriber additions. Airtel’s business revenue growth normalised to 4% on the quarter. They also said the company’s 32% QoQ increase in India (ex-Indus) capex was a surprise.Nomura has a buy rating on Titan with the target price at Rs 4,275. Analysts said the company’s Q2FY26 sales were strong and were largely in line with the pre-quarter update. However, margins were a bit lower on the year (YoY) but strong festive demand could drive an improvement in outlook. Its jewellery sales were in line though margins were a bit lower.Titan also reported a 13% growth in sales of watches, a little better than the pre-quarterly update of 12%. Its eyecare sales grew at 8.5% YoY, which was in line with the pre-quarter update. Titan also reported a 34% YoY growth in sales for its emerging businesses.Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating on Ambuja Cements with the target price at Rs 650. Analysts said the cement major’s revenues were in line with estimates with volumes and realizations largely in-line. EBITDA/ton was at Rs 1,060, ahead of the brokerage’s estimates. Under exceptionals, the company recognised losses aggregating Rs 220 crore to account for outstanding government grant, Rs 1,700 crore tax reversals. The company also upped its FY28 capacity target from about 140 million ton to about 155 million ton, led by debottlenecking.Macquarie has an outperform rating on Westlife Foodworld with the target price at Rs 750. Analysts said Q2FY26 EBITDA was below their and the market’s consensus estimates. The company is investing for growth while a pick-up in demand was the key. They also said limited signs of an industry recovery remain a concern.Jefferies has a buy rating on Ajanta Pharma with the target price at Rs 3,320, up from Rs 3120. Analysts said Ajanta Pharma’s Sept quarter numbers beat estimates and the outlook for the company remains strong. They said FY26 guidance pointed towards continued strength in the USA and increased sales growth in Africa.

Who is Bankim Brahmbhatt





What is the case against him





Where is Bankim Brahmbhatt now





What next





American investment giant BlackRock has accused Bankim Brahmbhatt, the Indian-origin CEO of US-based telecom companies Broadband Telecom and Bridgevoice, of multi-million-dollar fraud, The Wall Street Journal reported.Lenders, including HPS Investment Partners - the private credit arm of BlackRock - have accused Brahmbhatt’s firms of fabricating accounts receivable that were used as collateral for loans. The lenders now claim to be owed over $500 million. Brahmbhatt’s lawyer told WSJ that his client disputed the fraud allegations.Bankim Brahmbhatt is the founder, president and CEO of Bankai Group, a US-headquartered telecommunications and fintech company.In interviews with Entrepreneur Middle East and Industry Chronicle, Brahmbhatt described himself as a telecom engineer turned entrepreneur, who began his journey in 1989 by setting up a push-button telephone manufacturing unit in India. Over the years, his ventures expanded into satellite dishes, telecom billing, and digital financial solutions.Bankai Group’s flagship product, MobiFin Elite, provides digital financial services and has been implemented by clients across several countries, particularly in Africa.Brahmbhatt often spoke about his vision to create a self-sustaining ecosystem for carriers, operators, and financial institutions, combining “technical skills and people skills.”His LinkedIn profile which earlier has sizable followers appears to have deactivated.According to WSJ, HPS began lending to a financing arm linked to Brahmbhatt’s companies in September 2020, later expanding its exposure to about $430 million by August 2024, with BNP Paribas helping finance the loans.Trouble surfaced in July 2024, when an HPS employee discovered that some customer emails appeared to come from fake domains imitating real telecom firms. When questioned, Brahmbhatt reportedly assured HPS officials there was nothing to worry about, before stopping all communication.Subsequent checks by accounting firm CBIZ and law firm Quinn Emanuel, hired by the lenders, found that emails and invoices provided as proof of receivables were falsified, the report said. A Belgian telecom company, BICS, confirmed to investigators that it had no connection to the emails used by Brahmbhatt’s firms, calling it a “confirmed fraud attempt.”Court filings allege that fraudulent customer contracts dated back to 2018 and that assets pledged as collateral were transferred to offshore accounts in India and Mauritius.Brahmbhatt’s companies - Broadband Telecom, Bridgevoice, Carriox Capital II, and BB Capital SPV - filed for bankruptcy in August, the same month lenders sued. BNP Paribas also reported adding €190 million (around $220 million) in loan-loss provisions linked to a “specific credit situation,” though it did not name the borrower.HPS has told clients it believes Brahmbhatt is currently in India. A person who visited the New York offices of his companies in July found them closed and vacant, the WSJ report said.Brahmbhatt also filed for personal bankruptcy on August 12, the same day his companies sought Chapter 11 protection.Despite the scale of the alleged fraud, sources told WSJ that the incident represents only a small portion of HPS’s $179 billion in assets under management and is unlikely to materially affect BlackRock’s overall performance.While the US courts are now handling the bankruptcy proceedings and civil lawsuits, Brahmbhatt has denied these allegagtions and is missing. The full scope of the alleged fraud and its potential impact on BlackRock’s private credit arm and BNP Paribas remains under investigation.","Bankim brahmbhatt is the indian-origin ceo of us-based telecom companies broadband telecom and bridgevoice.

Guggenheim Museum in New York. (AP Photo, File)





LONDON: For sale: The world's most valuable toilet, a lavatory literally worth its weight in gold. Sotheby's announced Friday it will auction off the solid gold cistern, a sculpture by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan entitled ""America. ""The auction house calls it an ""incisive commentary on the collision of artistic production and commodity value."" It's also a fully functional toilet, identical to one that gained global fame when it was stolen in an audacious heist from England's Blenheim Palace in 2019.The starting price at the Nov 18 auction in New York will be the price of the just over 101.2kg of gold used to make it - about $10 million.David Galperin, head of contemporary art at Sotheby's in New York, said Cattelan is ""the consummate art world provocateur."" He's also one of most successful, an artist whose work ""Comedian,"" a banana duct-taped to a wall, sold at a New York auction last year for $6.2 million. ""Him"" - Cattelan's unsettling sculpture of a kneeling Adolf Hitler - sold for $17.2 million at a Christie's auction in 2016.The artist has said ""America"" satirises excessive wealth.""Whatever you eat, a $200 lunch or a $2 hot dog, the results are the same, toilet-wise,"" he once said.Two versions of ""America"" were created in 2016. The one being sold has been owned by an unnamed collector since 2017. The other version went on display in a bathroom at the Guggenheim Museum in New York in 2016. More than 100,000 visitors queued up to - to put it delicately - interact with the work.The Guggenheim offered the work to US President Donald Trump during his first term in office after he had asked to borrow a Van Gogh painting.In 2019, it went on show at Blenheim Palace, the English country manor that was the birthplace of Winston Churchill. Within days, it was stolen by burglars who broke into the building, forcibly wrenched it from the plumbing, and fled. Two men were convicted earlier this year and jailed. The toilet has never been recovered. Investigators think it was likely broken up and melted down.Galperin is unwilling to speculate on how much ""America"" could sell for. He notes that Cattelan's duct-taped banana posed questions about ""how one assigns value to something that has, in essence, no value aside from its authorship and its conceptual idea.""'America' is in many ways the complete inverse of that. It is a perfect foil in that this work has a lot of intrinsic value in a way that most artworks do not,"" he said ""The question of the proportion of value between the raw materials and the artistic idea is very on the table here.""""America"" will go on display at Sotheby's new New York headquarters, the Breuer Building, from Nov 8 until the auction. It will be in a bathroom, and visitors will be able to see it up close and personal.At Guggenheim and Blenheim Palace, the toilet was connected to the plumbing system and visitors could book a 3-minute appointment to use it. This time, visitors won't be able to use it - they can look, but they can't flush.","Sotheby's will auction off the solid gold cistern, a sculpture by italian artist maurizio cattelan entitled ""america"" it's also a fully functional toilet, identical to one that gained global fame when it was stolen in an audacious heist from england's blenheim palace in 2019.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125008566,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-65280,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Password for Louvre’s security system was ‘LOUVRE’ — and social media can’t stop laughing: ‘Not even L0uvr3?!’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/password-for-louvres-security-system-was-louvre-and-social-media-cant-stop-laughing-not-even-l0uvr3/articleshow/125117435.cms,"Watch: Louvre Jewels Stolen In Seconds: Thief Caught On Camera

Social media reactions:





A post-heist security audit has revealed shocking details about the Louvre’s cybersecurity, revealing that the password protecting France’s most famous museum’s video surveillance system was simply “LOUVRE. ”French newspaper Libération first reported the revelation.The revelations come weeks after the daring October 18 heist, in which thieves made off with crown jewels worth $102 million (£76 million) from the Galerie d’Apollon in broad daylight in a few minutes. The robbers entered via a balcony using a stolen mechanical lift, smashed display cases, and escaped.The findings about the security system are part of a wider trove of documents from the French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI), which has been auditing the museum’s systems for more than a decade.In a 2014 review, ANSSI warned that the Louvre’s IT systems that are responsible for alarms, access control, and video surveillance were dangerously vulnerable. “An attacker who manages to take control of it would be able to facilitate damage or even theft of artworks,” the report said.Cybersecurity advisor Javvad Malik of software firm KnowBe4 described the museum’s defences as “shockingly simplistic.” He told the Daily Mail, “The museum's video surveillance systems were protected by shockingly simplistic passwords.Whether this weakness played a role in the heist is still under review. But the lesson is clear. When systems safeguarding priceless cultural treasures rely on guessable credentials, it's not a policy gap – it is an invitation, serving as an indicator that the overall culture of security may be weak. ”Adding to the embarrassment, the report found the museum was still using outdated versions of Windows, which experts say is equivalent to “leaving your front door unlocked.” Later reviews, including those as recent as 2025, suggested the Louvre continued to suffer from major cybersecurity flaws.Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau told Franceinfo radio that the suspects were likely “petty criminals rather than professional members of an organised crime group.”The French daylight heist has since resulted in the endless ridicule of the Louvre across social media, including from billionaire CEO Elon Musk.","The password protecting the louvre's video surveillance system was simply “louvre. ” french newspaper libération first reported the revelation. The revelations come weeks after the daring october 18 heist, in which thieves made off with crown jewels worth $102 million.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125117572,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-965972,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Sulfur Cave spiders thrive in a unique Sulfur-powered ecosystem





In an astonishing discovery, scientists have found what is believed to be the world’s largest spiderweb inside Sulfur Cave, a dark and narrow passage located on the border between Greece and Albania. This extraordinary web, sprawling over a massive 106 square meters (1,140 square feet), is home to an estimated 111,000 spiders living together in an unprecedented colonial network.The web, first discovered by cavers from the Czech Speleological Society during a 2022 expedition in Vromoner Canyon, is a remarkable patchwork of thousands of individual funnel-shaped webs clinging to the cave walls. A team of researchers led by István Urák from the Sapientia Hungarian University of Transylvania in Romania visited the cave in 2024 to study this extraordinary arachnid colony.The colony comprises two dominant species: about 69,000 individuals of Tegenaria domestica, commonly known as the barn funnel weaver or domestic house spider, alongside more than 42,000 Prinerigone vagans, a type of sheet weaver spider. This is the first documented instance of these two common species exhibiting cooperative colonial behavior instead of their usual solitary or predatory interactions.According to the researchers, the absence of light within Sulfur Cave appears to have altered normal spider behaviors, potentially disrupting predatory instincts and allowing these species to coexist in such high densities.The cave environment is uniquely sustained by a sulfur-rich stream flowing through the cavern, producing hydrogen sulfide that supports a sulfur-based microbial biofilm ecosystem.The spiders’ primary diet consists of non-biting midges, which feed on these microbial films, creating a fascinating sulfur-driven food web that sustains the massive spider colony. This cave ecosystem is unlike any other, as molecular and gut content analyses reveal that the cave-dwelling spiders have genetically diverged from their surface relatives and possess less diverse microbiomes due to their sulphur-based diet.The cave is also a hotspot for reproduction, with female house spiders known to lay six to eight egg sacs every 20 to 25 days, each containing up to 100 eggs in the first cocoon, followed by smaller successive clutches. The density of the webs makes it impossible to count all the egg sacs precisely.“The moment of discovery inspired admiration, respect, and gratitude,” said lead author Urák, emphasizing the uniqueness and ecological importance of this find. The research team is now preparing for further studies to better understand the web’s ecology and the adaptations of its arachnid inhabitants. Conservation of this site remains a priority, given its fragile and isolated nature.This groundbreaking discovery sheds light on how species adapt within extreme environments and reveals a hidden biodiversity hotspot demonstrating remarkable biological cooperation and survival.","Scientists have found what is believed to be the world’s largest spiderweb inside sulfur cave, a dark and narrow passage located on the border between greece and albania.

Meet the richest Indian in the UAE: Who Is Rizwan Sajan; what is his net worth?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/meet-the-richest-indian-in-the-uae-who-is-rizwan-sajan-what-is-his-net-worth/articleshow/125101266.cms,"Rizwan Sajan, founder of Dubai’s Danube Group, rose from Mumbai’s Ghatkopar slums to lead a global $2 billion conglomerate/ Image: Danube Group

Accolades and impact







Rizwan Sajan’s journey from the crowded lanes of Ghatkopar in Mumbai to becoming Dubai’s richest Indian reads like a modern-day rags-to-riches saga. Today, the 60-year-old billionaire stands atop a business empire worth ₹16,709 crore (US$2 billion), with a personal net worth of ₹20,833 crore (US$2.5 billion), a far cry from his modest beginnings in suburban India.Born into a middle-class family in Mumbai’s Ghatkopar, Rizwan Sajan’s early life was steeped in struggle. When he was just 16, tragedy struck, his father passed away suddenly, forcing him to abandon school and shoulder the family’s financial burden.Using a small kitty his father had managed to save from his workplace, Sajan began manufacturing box files to keep the household afloat. The business found some success, but money was still tight. “Making ends meet was a daily challenge,” he later recalled.Two years on, fortune smiled in the form of his uncle, who offered him a job in Kuwait. “That was my lottery,” Sajan told Forbes India. In Mumbai, he had been earning around ₹6,000 a month; in Kuwait, his new salary jumped to ₹18,000, roughly 150 Kuwaiti dinars at the time. Starting as a trainee salesman, he worked his way up to a managerial role, with his pay ballooning from 150 to 1,500 dinars.Add a monthly sales commission of nearly 50,000 dinars, and Sajan suddenly found himself living a dream.With his newfound wealth, he bought a Toyota Land Cruiser, purchased a home in Bandra, and even financed his sister’s wedding — milestones that symbolised how far he had come.Then, just as swiftly, the dream collapsed. In August 1990, Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, throwing the region into turmoil. Sajan was forced to flee back to Mumbai, abandoning everything he had built. “That was the second turning point in my life,” he said. “I was back to zero.”But as history would prove, it was also the beginning of his greatest ascent.In 1993, Rizwan Sajan arrived in Dubai with just a few thousand dirhams and a vision. That same year, he founded Danube Group, a modest trading firm dealing in building materials. “It was a brokerage business, where I was making commission,” he later recalled. Before long, he transitioned into full-scale building material trading, a decision that proved transformative.His timing was impeccable. Dubai was on the cusp of a construction boom, and Sajan’s relentless drive positioned Danube at the heart of it. Over the next decade and a half, he steadily diversified the company, laying the foundations of what would become one of the region’s most dynamic business empires.In 2006, Sajan launched Milano, a brand offering sanitary solutions. Two years later came Danube Home in 2008, marking his entry into home furnishings. By 2012, he expanded again with Alucopanel, a venture specialising in aluminium composite panels — followed by the company’s entry into real estate in 2014. “Since then, there has been no looking back,” Sajan told Forbes India.Today, Danube Group has evolved into a diversified conglomerate spanning real estate, building materials, and home décor. Its flagship divisions, Danube Home, Milano, and Alucopanel, operate across India, China, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Oman, and Canada, with an annual turnover exceeding US$2 billion (₹16,709 crore).Sajan’s son Adel Sajan now serves as Group Managing Director, while his brother Anil Sajan holds the role of Vice Chairman, steering the next phase of Danube’s expansion.When Sajan entered the real estate sector in 2014, he sought to “democratise luxury” for Dubai’s vast expatriate population, many of whom were renters rather than homeowners. His innovative “1% plan” offered buyers the option to pay just 1% of the property’s value monthly after a small down payment, with the balance due upon completion.“The consumer would have already paid 50–60% by the time the building is ready.” The model made homeownership accessible to thousands of expatriates and reshaped mid-market property sales in Dubai.The success of Danube Properties earned Sajan a 10-year UAE Golden Visa in 2019, recognising his contribution to the nation’s economy.Over the years, Rizwan Sajan has been consistently recognised as one of the Gulf’s most influential business figures. In 2021, he was ranked 12th on Forbes Middle East’s “Top 100 Indian Leaders in the UAE” and received the prestigious Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Business Excellence Award, honours that cemented his status as a leading name in the region’s business landscape.Since then, Sajan’s wealth and influence have only grown. As of 2025, he stands as the richest Indian in the UAE and is counted among the top ten richest billionaires in the Emirates. His journey, from a modest upbringing in Mumbai’s Ghatkopar to leading a multibillion-dollar empire in Dubai, has become one of the most remarkable rags-to-riches stories in the Gulf.Beyond boardrooms and balance sheets, he founded the Danube Welfare Society, offering free training programmes to help unskilled workers improve their language and technical skills, a gesture that mirrors his own humble beginnings.“The UAE was, and will remain, a land of opportunity,” Sajan has said. “It has helped us foreigners not only develop ourselves, but also contribute to the UAE’s society and economy.”","Rizwan sajan, founder of dubai's danube group, rose from mumbai's ghatkopar slums to lead a global $2 billion conglomerate.
