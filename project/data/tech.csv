"Pete Alonso Contract: After Pete Alonso's Short-Term Deal, Mets Could Be Targeting $400M Guerrero Jr.",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/after-pete-alonsos-short-term-deal-mets-could-be-targeting-400m-guerrero-jr-/articleshow/118258870.cms,"THE CANADIAN PRESS/Christopher Katsarov

Mets Maintain Flexibility with Pete Alonso’s Short-Term Contract Decision



Mets Could Pursue Vladimir Guerrero Jr. as a Major Free-Agent Acquisition



Financial Implications: Will the Mets Make Another Monster Splash?



The New York Mets signing Pete Alonso to a short-term contract might be paving the way for an even larger move. Rumors indicate that the Mets are preparing to make a run at Toronto Blue Jays first baseman Vladimir Guerrero Jr. in the next offseason. With Guerrero likely to seek a deal worth more than $400 million, this possible move would redefine the Mets' future.Alonso's new two-year, $54 million deal features an opt-out after one season, allowing him to try his luck on the market again in just nine months. The Mets' hesitation to sign him for more than two years—allegedly rejecting a five-year, $130 million contract—indicates that they are holding onto financial flexibility for a significant acquisition. With Alonso's value being mostly attributed to his home run output, the front office might be considering younger, more versatile players.Increasing speculation suggests the Mets are targeting Guerrero Jr., who is five years younger than Alonso and shares elite level hitting skills. Word has Guerrero's people established an extension window by Feb. 18 to retain him in the Blue Jays with the looming prospect of winter free agency awaiting next winter should he hit free agency. Had he become free, he'd have been an exemplary long-term stud to match freshly signed Juan Soto.The Mets recently invested $765 million in Juan Soto, and some have even hinted that this might be a one-off spending spree. Still, with ownership's appetite to spend on star players, it cannot be eliminated that another big deal will follow. If Guerrero goes into free agency, the Mets could very well be the top contender to sign another generation talent.Having structured Alonso's deal with short-term options, the Mets have made themselves available to make a monster deal. New York might then be in their best position ever to sign him if Guerrero Jr. does somehow come on the market. Alonso's next year will be deciding his fate among the Mets organization and whether New York is comfortable handing out a second record-breaker to obtain a superstar at first base.Also Read: New York Yankees’ $90,000,000 All-Star at Risk of Losing His Spot as Young Talent Pushes for Third Base Job","The new york mets signed pete alonso to a short-term contract, paving the way for an even larger move.

“He’s got the precise ability to be a surgeon,” states Longtime FOX Analyst Joel Klatt about Colorado QB Shedeur Sanders

The Joel Klatt Show: A College Football Podcast,

“Here’s the reason. Sheduer has the beautiful combination of the ability to be a prototypical passer from the pocket. And he’s got the precise ability to be a surgeon in those cases. He also has the ability to be an artist, and that combination doesn’t come around a lot.”

The Eddie Crowder awardee, Joel Klatt, compared QB Shedeur Sanders to the 85 YO Minnesota Vikings quarterback Fran Tarkenton

“His (Shedeur's) ability to create outside of the pocket and extend the play is Fran Tarkenton-esque. He’s excellent in those situations. If you give him some time in the pocket, which Colorado did not generally do with that offensive line.

If he has time and he can diagnose what’s going on, he can be surgical in the pocket. I believe that he has a chance to be much better in the NFL than he was even at Colorado.”

“I don’t think Shedeur Sanders is going to want to play No. 1 in Tennessee, and I do not believe that any other players should be taken No. 1.

Tennessee can either not take him and go with Cam Ward at No. 1. Or I think they can get some capital. Still, fall back and potentially get Cam Ward. I believe Tennessee trades the first pick.

I believe that the Giants jump to No. 1, from three to one. They do have a great relationship with Shedeur Sanders. They have vetted him out several times. I believe that it is reciprocal.”

UK Home Buying Selling Reforms: UK to digitise property sales for faster transactions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/fit-for-21st-century-uk-to-digitise-property-sales-for-faster-transactions/articleshow/118106621.cms,"Long homebuying process in UK

The UK government is planning to digitise property sales data to speed up home purchases and reduce delays, The Guardian reports.A 12-week initiative has been launched to create standardised rules for data sharing among conveyancers, lenders, and others involved in transactions.Currently, much of the process relies on paper documents or outdated systems, causing delays. The changes aim to improve information sharing and make the process more efficient.""We are streamlining the cumbersome homebuying process so that it is fit for the 21st century, helping homebuyers save money, gain time, and reduce stress while also cutting the number of house sales that fall through,"" housing and planning minister Matthew Pennycook was quoted as saying, according to The Guardian.The initiative is part of a wider housing reform plan, including changes to planning rules, building 1.5 million homes, and leasehold reforms.Buying a home in the UK typically takes months, with delays caused by conveyancing, property searches, and document retrieval.According to Rightmove, the UK's largest online real estate portal, it takes an average of five months from offer acceptance to moving in.Rightmove CEO Johan Svanstrom explained that this follows an initial two-month period for property selection and offer agreement. He added: ""The current process also contributes to an average of more than one in five home sales falling through, and hopefully a better process can help reduce this as well.""The ministry of housing, communities and local government says full digitalisation will allow instant access to information for mortgage providers and surveyors, with single identity verification.Right now, important documents like building control and highways records are mostly on paper. Delays also happen because there are no standardised protocols for accessing and verifying electronic data.To improve this, the ministry is working with HM Land Registry (HMLR) and experts from the Digital Property Market Steering Group.HMLR will lead 10-month pilot projects with councils to test digital data sharing. Plans also include digital identity verification to speed up transactions.New leasehold legislation taking effect on March 3 will give leaseholders more control over service charge costs and remove their obligation to pay freeholder legal fees for right-to-manage claims.These changes could save leaseholders up to £3,000 on legal costs and reduce landlord obstruction tactics.Pennycook said the reforms will help leaseholders ""more easily and cheaply take control of the buildings they live in and clamp down on unreasonable or extortionate charges.""","The uk government is planning to digitise property sales data to speed up home purchases.

Takeaways: Tesla has sued Chinese customers and journalists and won almost every time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/takeaways-tesla-has-sued-chinese-customers-and-journalists-and-won-almost-every-time/articleshow/118180992.cms,"In this photo, Zhang Yazhou sits on the roof of her damaged Tesla Model 3 with a bullhorn outside a Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou (Image credits: AP)

Tesla did not return requests for comment. Here are some key things to know about Tesla's success in China:

Media coverage of Tesla in China is constrained

BEIJING: Tesla has embraced an aggressive legal strategy in China to stifle its critics suing its own customers.That's left some Tesla owners desperate. Zhang Yazhou protested publicly that her Model 3's brakes had failed and caused an accident in 2021 that sent her parents to the hospital. Tesla said that wasn't true and sued her for defamation. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay the $1.1-trillion company more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize for her criticism.""I refuse to accept it,"" said Zhang, who appealed the verdict. ""As a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.""As concerns mount about eroding checks and balances in the US, Tesla's record in China shows how it has thrived in a system where regulators, the courts and media all answer to the ruling Communist Party.It's not common for automakers in China or elsewhere to sue their own customers. But Tesla has done so successfully in China, where Elon Musk 's company has used the courts and the patronage of a powerful leader to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.Musk has a powerful patron in China Tesla's commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China's premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping . Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China's financial capital under his watch in 2019.With Li's support, Tesla was the first foreign automaker allowed to retain complete control over its China venture. Tesla got low-interest loans, tax breaks, favorable regulatory changes and other benefits.In January 2020, Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. That year, Tesla turned an annual profit for the first time in its history and Musk was soon declared the world's richest person.Musk's ""greater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,"" said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd, an advisory firm based in Shanghai. ""He's done a good job of it in China, and he's done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.""Requests for comment to the state council, which is run by Li Qiang, went unanswered.Tesla has had an impressive winning streak in Chinese courts Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures.The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review of public court documents and Chinese media reports by The Associated Press.Tesla won all eleven cases for which AP could determine the verdicts. Two judgments are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it has also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgments in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.While some industry experts say it's generally difficult for customers to win such cases, others say it's remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.""For Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,"" said Russo, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. ""The odds are stacked against you. It's like going to the casino and winning every hand.""In a statement to AP, the Shanghai high people's court said that judgements are the result of a ""fair trial.""""It cannot be assumed that the party has received 'special protection' or 'special treatment' because of their victory,"" the court wrote.Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.""We were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,"" a tech reporter told AP.Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk's company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. PingWest had to apologize for a report that claimed Tesla's Shanghai factory was a ""sweatshop"" and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). The AP could not determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com, which drew Tesla's ire after writing about the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla.Electric vehicle giant BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors in going after car owners who suffered crashes.""Tesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,"" said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,000) after he wrote about Tesla's alleged brake failures. ""Tesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.""","Tesla's success in china has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: li qiang, the former party boss of shanghai who is now china's premier.

MUMBAI: In a setback to Digvijay Gaekwad 's plans to make a competing offer for Religare Enterprises , the Securities and Exchange Board of India ( Sebi ) rejected his application on Friday, citing a lack of proof of financial resources and terming the application as frivolous.In his application, Gaekwad, who is a Florida-based investor, had requested Sebi's exemption from strict enforcement of regulation 20 of takeover rules by allowing him to make a competing offer to acquire 55% of Religare at Rs 275 per share.Sebi said Gaekwad had ""failed to demonstrate his ability to meet the financial obligation for making the competing open offer"". It also noted Gaekwad's non-compliance with the Supreme Court order, stating that he had ""failed to deposit Rs 600 crore, as directed by the Supreme Court, which would have shown his commitment towards making the offer"". The rejection of Gaekwad's application removes a hurdle for the Burmans , the largest shareholders of Religare, who have been attempting to gain control of the company.""In the absence of adequate proof of financial resources required for making the offer, the application does not appear to be bonafide,"" Sebi said. It deemed the application frivolous and aimed at hindering the open offer process of the Burmans. As a result, it disposed of the application filed by Gaekwad. Friday's order follows Religare's announcement on the departure of its chairperson Rashmi Saluja from the company.Shareholders had voted against her reappointment, resulting in the termination of her directorship.The Burmans had made an open offer for an additional 26% stake in Religare at Rs 235 per share, but they only managed to acquire 0.26% in the open offer that closed on Thursday.","Digvijay gaekwad's plans to make a competing offer for religare enterprises rejected.

Bitter chocolate: High prices pinch pockets on Valentine's Day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bitter-chocolate-high-prices-pinch-pockets-on-valentines-day/articleshow/118263021.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: For consumers, love may have come at a cost this Valentine's Day. Chocolates, the go-to gifting choice for the season have become more expensive on the back of soaring global cocoa prices, nudging several companies to take price hikes. This essentially means that the price increases which have been taken over the past few months have now hit the markets and consumers are paying more to buy the same pack of their favourite chocolate. Amul, for instance, took a price hike of about 20%-30% for its chocolates around August 2024. ""Global cocoa prices are trending at $10,000 per metric ton. We haven't seen such price rise in the last 50 years. The situation doesn't look good but we have to live with it,"" Jayen Mehta, MD at Gujarat Cooperative Milk Marketing Federation, which owns the brand Amul, told TOI. The company remains watchful of the situation, Mehta said, not ruling out further price hikes if the situation warrants. Global cocoa prices which have been on the boil for quite some time due to scarce supply reached nearly $13,000 per metric ton in December last year, hitting a record high.Chocolate prices have surged by nearly 50% compared to Valentine's Day last year, said Ashwin Rathi, chief financial officer at Smoor Chocolates. The company said that it has recorded a 100% increase in raw material costs over the past year. ""While cocoa costs have nearly doubled, we have limited the price adjustment to only 30%-40% of the total increase. We have absorbed a significant portion (of the cost increase) to ensure our products remain accessible to our customers,"" said Rathi.For Indians who love to snack on chocolates, the rise in prices comes at a time when they have already been tightening their household budgets due to inflation.Global chocolate makers like Mondelez, Hershey's and Nestle have been grappling with rising prices of cocoa. In its recent earnings, Mondelez International, the maker of Cadbury chocolates termed the cocoa cost inflation as ""unprecedented."" The company said that if cocoa prices remain elevated, more price increases may be required in the second half of 2025 and in 2026, although the attempt will be to hold on to the price points of low unit pricing (low unit packs) in ""emerging markets"" (like India).","Chocolate prices have surged by nearly 50% compared to valentine's day last year.

NEW DELHI: Wholesale price inflation eased marginally in Jan on the back of moderating food prices , indicating softening of price pressures as supplies improved.Data released by the commerce and industry ministry on Friday showed inflation, as measured by the wholesale price index (WPI) rose an annual 2.3% in Jan, softening slightly from the 2.4% in December.Positive rate of inflation in Jan 2025 is primarily due to increase in prices of manufacture of food products, food articles, other manufacturing, non-food articles and manufacture of textiles, said an official statement from the ministry. Earlier data released by the NSO showed retail inflation , as measured by the consumer price index (CI), slowed to a five-month low in Jan, aided by a softening in food prices.The data showed inflation in food articles slowed to 5.9% in Jan from 6% in the previous month. Vegetable prices , which have been stubborn, softened to 8.4%, moderating from 28.7% in the previous month. Inflation in potatoes eased a tad, rising 74.3% from 93.2% in Dec, but onion prices strengthened 28.3% in Jan from 16.8% in the previous month.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has cut rates by 25 basis points earlier this month - the first cut in nearly five years. The decision was largely led by a softening in price pressures.","Wholesale price inflation eased marginally in jan on the back of moderating food prices.

Bitcoin bull mania has gripped the crypto market once again. This time, in a meme coin format. Bitcoin Bull ($BTCBULL) just broke the $1 million milestone in its presale.The community-driven token is on a mission to give investors exposure to the BTC bull mania, which is hyped to touch $1 million and beyond. Whenever Bitcoin hits a major price milestone, $BTCBULL holders receive Bitcoin as a reward.BTC is one of the world’s most successful assets. It has registered an AAR (Average Annual Return) of 230%. For better context, the token has seen its value rise over 200 million percent since its beginning. However, most of the market missed out on BTC’s massive explosion over the years. $BTCBULL is here to alleviate the regret. With BTC expected to grow and expand further, from $100,000 to $250,000 and beyond $1 million, investors are optimistic. Increased media coverage, widespread adoption, and potential use in national reserves have strengthened the bullish narratives.With $BTCBULL, investors can join the Bitcoin movement at an affordable price. The platform hosts $BTCBULL and $BTC airdrops that coincide with the key price milestones of Bitcoin.True, BTC has experienced multifold growth over the years and most investors can’t afford to pay $100,000 to buy a Bitcoin. But $BTCBULL gives the community exposure to BTC’s growth at small costs.$BTCBULL has a total supply of 21 billion tokens, while BTC has a total supply of 21 million. $BTCBULL has implemented a built-in deflationary model to bring more scarcity into the tokenomics over time.The burning mechanism is designed to drive the value of the token by taking advantage of the inverse relationship between price and supply. It rewards long-term $BTCBULL investors by creating upward price pressure through increased demand.Exciting $BTCBULL airdrops or burns are activated every time $BTC hits a new price milestone. For example, when the BTC price hits $100,000 after the $BTCBULL presale sell-out, the token will make its debut exchange listing. When the Bitcoin price hits $125,000, a token burn goes live, and when it touches $150,000, a BTC airdrop will go live.Being built on the Ethereum blockchain using the EVM standard, the token is more conducive to adoption and trading than BRC-20 tokens.While BRC-20 tokens demand Bitcoin-native wallets that are complex to handle for everyday investors, Ethereum wallets offer seamless trading. Although $BTCBULL is an Ethereum token, the rewards are compatible with multichain wallets. After the presale sell-out, the token will be listed on leading crypto exchanges .With a multichain wallet, $BTCBULL holders can receive $BTC and $BTCBULL airdrop rewards. The ongoing $BTCBULL presale is also hosting a passive income program that rewards users for depositing their tokens in the contract. $BTCBULL rewards will be distributed to passive income participants throughout the presale and for the following two years.The crypto market is crowded with meme coins. Yet, there are few Bitcoin-themed meme coins. That is a shame, since both meme coins and BTC are evergreen topics. $BTCBULL cleverly combines these two and offers investors a fun and inclusive way to earn bitcoin rewards .In a market full of dog and frog coins, $BTCBULL stands out with its vibrant illustrations and bold narratives. Although it has been just days since the presale launched, the community is fast-growing. As a project that targets both Bitcoin purists and meme coin degens, $BTCBULL has a target market worth over 2 trillion dollars.$BTCBULL represents Bitcoin bullishness and cheers for BTC’s journey to $1 million through memes, reward programs, and community engagement by tapping into Bitcoin’s deep-rooted brand strength.$BTCBULL has joined forces with Best Wallet to offer a seamless presale experience. Early backers can buy the token via the Upcoming Tokens section on Best Wallet. By opting for this purchase mode, investors will get BTC airdrop rewards directly in their multichain wallets through the Best Wallet mobile app.The presale also supports purchases using Metamask, Wallet Connect, and Coinbase Wallet.

TikTok returns to Apple and Google app stores in US after Trump delays ban,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tiktok-returns-to-apple-and-google-app-stores-in-us-after-trump-delays-ban/articleshow/118232709.cms,"TikTok is back on Apple and Google app stores in the United States after President Donald Trump delayed enforcing a ban on the short-form video platform for 75 days.The Chinese-owned social media platform was reinstated on Thursday evening, weeks after being removed in compliance with a newly enacted law prohibiting its operation in the country.Trump attempted to delay enforcement of the TikTok ban through an executive order, but companies hesitated to restore the app until they were certain it would not violate the law.The legislation, passed last year, mandated that ByteDance , TikTok's Chinese parent company, divest ownership to a non-Chinese entity by January 19. It also imposed significant financial penalties on app store operators and internet hosting providers that continued to distribute or support TikTok.According to The New York Times, TikTok executives expressed optimism during a briefing call on Tuesday that Apple and Google would soon reinstate the app. H. Lee Justine, a TikTok creator and author who participated in the call, confirmed the statement.""They said that the administration had given them a lot of information that they wouldn't be penalized and that they were really hopeful that any day now they would put it back in the app stores,"" she said in an interview.""It makes me very hopeful that they felt that they could do this because hopefully this means that long term there's not going to be issues and this will work out,"" she added.Despite Apple and Google preventing new TikTok downloads, previously installed versions continued functioning normally on American devices.TikTok's reinstatement on app stores is a promising development, granting the company until early April to secure a buyer. This marks a dramatic turnaround—just a month ago, it faced a ban with strong bipartisan support in Congress. The law had even received unanimous approval from the Supreme Court before being overturned by Trump.",Tiktok is back on apple and google app stores in the united states.

Thomson Reuters wins AI copyright battle in US against Ross Intelligence,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/thomson-reuters-wins-ai-copyright-battle-in-us-against-ross-intelligence/articleshow/118231116.cms,"Thomson Reuters has secured an early legal victory in the ongoing debate over fair use in AI-related copyright cases. The media and technology company sued Ross Intelligence—a now-defunct legal research firm—in 2020, alleging that it unlawfully used content from its legal platform, Westlaw, to train an AI model without authorisation.Judge Stephanos Bibas of the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled a decision on Tuesday that Ross Intelligence was not entitled to use Thomson Reuters' content under US copyright law to develop a competing platform.According to the Associated Press, Bibas, in the summary judgment, concluded that ""none of Ross's possible defenses holds water"" and ruled in Reuters' favour regarding the ""fair use"" matter.Under US law, the ""fair use"" doctrine permits limited use of copyrighted materials for purposes such as teaching, research, or creating a transformative work.In an email to WIRED, Reuters' representative Jeffrey McCoy expressed satisfaction with the verdict, stating that: “We are pleased that the court granted summary judgment in our favor and concluded that Westlaw’s editorial content created and maintained by our attorney editors, is protected by copyright and cannot be used without our consent,” he wrote. “The copying of our content was not ‘fair use.’”Reuters' victory emerges amidst an increasing number of legal challenges initiated by creators, artists and music companies against AI system developers over comparable concerns.The common thread in these legal disputes is the allegation that technology firms utilised vast collections of human-authored content to train their AI systems for generating text that mimics human writing, without seeking authorisation or offering payment to the original content creators.OpenAI and its commercial partner Microsoft are facing copyright infringement lawsuits from renowned authors, including John Grisham, Jodi Picoult, and ""Game of Thrones"" creator George R.R. Martin, as well as separate legal challenges from major media outlets such as The New York Times, the Chicago Tribune, and Mother Jones.","Thomson reuters has secured an early legal victory in the ongoing debate over fair use in ai-related copyright cases.

"Amazon reports strong earnings for Q4, but stocks dip due to outlook for the 1st quarter",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/amazon-reports-strong-earnings-for-q4-but-stocks-dip-due-to-outlook-for-the-1st-quarter/articleshow/117998797.cms,"Amazon on Thursday reported better-than-expected revenue and profits for the holiday shopping period, but its stocks dipped in after-hours trading due to disappointing guidance for the current quarter.The Seattle-based e-commerce and technology company said its revenue for the October-December period totaled $187.8 billion, a 10% jump compared to the same period in 2023. Profits came out to $20 billion while earnings per share reached $1.86, higher than the $1.49 that analysts surveyed by FactSet had anticipated.But the company said it expected revenue for the current quarter to be between $151 billion and 155.5 billion, lower than the $158.56 billion that analysts were expecting. The guidance anticipates ""an unusually large, unfavorable impact"" from foreign exchange rates, it said.Amazon is the biggest online shopping destination in the U.S. and has long been a beneficiary of consumer spending during the holidays. As it has done in recent years, the company in October began offering promotions intended to lure early holiday shoppers. It advertised other discounts during the three-month period, including on major sales days such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.Amazon on Thursday reported it saw $75.5 billion in revenue for its online shopping business, up 7% from the same period in 2023.Across the retail industry, holiday sales in November and December were better than expected compared with the previous year as lower inflation on holiday goods enticed shoppers to buy, according to The National Retail Federation. Online shopping also saw record sales levels, Adobe Analytics reported in January.Sales for Amazon Web services, the company's prominent cloud computing unit, rose 19% during the fourth quarter. But it fell slightly below analysts expectations.Amazon is one of the biggest players in the competitive tech race around generative artificial intelligence. Like other tech companies, it has ramped up investments in the technology and is spending billions to expand data centers that support AI and cloud computing. The company is also spending money on other equipment, including its own computer chips and those developed by Nvidia. It has also rolled out its own AI models and integrated the generative AI into other parts of its business.In the fourth quarter, Amazon reported spending $27.8 billion on property and equipment, significantly higher than the same period in 2023. Most of the spending was geared towards AI and AWS, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during a call with analysts on Thursday.""We think virtually every application that we know of today is going to be re-invented with AI inside of it,"" Jassy said. ""I think both our business, our customers and shareholders will be happy medium-to-long term that we're pursuing the capital opportunity and the business opportunity in AI.""Jassy also said during the call that Amazon, like many others, was ""impressed"" by DeepSeek, the Chinese artificial intelligence company whose chatbot recently became the most downloaded app in the U.S.Amazon's quarterly report also comes as the retail industry is absorbing a new 10% tariff President Donald Trump imposed on Chinese imports on Tuesday. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been put on hold for about a month.Trump also thew out a trade exemption that allowed low-value shipments from China to bypass duties, a loophole that had given an advantage to China-founded e-commerce firms, such as Shein and Temu.The new tariffs could benefit Amazon by increasing costs for its competitors. But it would also impact Chinese sellers who connect with American consumers on the company's shopping platform. Furthermore, it could raise prices on a recently-launched online storefront that Amazon set up to ship low-cost products directly from China. The storefront, called Amazon Haul, was Amazon's answer to Shein and Temu.Additionally, analysts from Morgan Stanley wrote in a Monday note that Amazon's first-party retail business, though which the company sells products purchased from manufacturers, has the highest exposure to the tariffs. The analysts estimate 25% of the merchandise sold through that business comes from China.","Amazon reported better-than-expected revenue and profits for the holiday shopping period.
