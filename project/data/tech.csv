The discovery of ignorance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/the-discovery-of-ignorance/articleshow/123717836.cms,"Thirukkural

with the Times explores real-world lessons from the classic Tamil text ‘Thirukkural’. Written by Tamil poet and philosopher Thiruvalluvar, the Kural consists of 1,330 short couplets of seven words each. This text is divided into three books with teachings on virtue, wealth, and

love

and is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality. The Kural has influenced scholars and leaders across social, political, and philosophical spheres.

Motivational speaker, author and diversity champion Bharathi Bhaskar explores the masterpiece.

Kamathuppaal

“Aridhoaru Ariyaamai Kandatraal Kaamam





Seridhoarum Seyizhai Maattu.”

The more men learn, the more their ignorance they detect; so is passion—that discovers more of her undiscovered secrets at every union.

Book of Love

The genius of Thiruvalluvar lies not only in the wisdom of his words but in his craft. Nowhere is this more visible than in—the Book of Love. With just two principal characters—the man and his beloved—he scripts a complete play of 25 chapters and 250 couplets.Apart from the two, there are only faint shadows of other figures; the thozhi, friend of the lady, paangan, friend of the lad, and the foster mother of the lady. It remains a two-character play, where Valluvar carefully scripts the entire arc of a relationship; intimate yet vast, narrow in frame but infinite in resonance.The lover celebrates her beauty while she longs for eternal companionship. There are moments of bliss, episodes of quarrels, reconciliations, separations, and the yearning to be reunited. In every line, the elixir of love binds them together.And what is the play about? Nothing less than life itself. Love is the pinnacle of human happiness, a universal experience that transcends cultures and centuries. The drama of love has not changed — couples quarrel, break up, reconcile, and rush back into each other’s arms. Perhaps the Gods themselves must be weary of watching the same scenes replay endlessly. Yet when these emotions are woven with the grandeur of poetry, they appear fresh.What elevates this poetic drama is not just its theme but the devices Valluvar employs. He uses soliloquy, dramatic irony, metaphors, and similes to breathe life into his characters. The result is more than poetry—it is theatre, staged not in grand halls but in the hearts of those who read it.What makes Valluvar’s poetry radiant are also some unexpected allegories and parables that almost jolt you. Couplet 1110, is an example:At first glance, this seems misplaced. Such a thought could have belonged in the chapters on learning () or wisdom (). Indeed, it describes a universal truth: the more one discovers, the more one realises how little one knows. Newton’s confession: “I feel like a boy playing on the seashore, finding pebbles, while the great ocean of truth lies undiscovered before me” is a perfect echo of this.Galileo, on the night of January 7, 1610, peering at Jupiter through his telescope, must have felt this same shock—that the universe is infinitely larger than one can fathom. Ramanujan, writing his first theorem, must have sensed that numbers conceal an inexhaustible world. In knowledge, every discovery reveals the immensity of what remains.Why then does Valluvar speak of this in the? Because love too is an endless quest. The lover, like the seeker, realises that every new glimpse of his beloved opens yet another hidden dimension of her being. The journey of desire is also like an endless path where every door opened leads to another. Knowledge and love, science and passion—all the different quests merge in the recognition that the greatest truths are inexhaustible.Perhaps the only certainty is that Valluvar himself was in love. For only one who has truly loved could have dared to compare the boundless mysteries of the universe with the inexhaustible depth of a beloved.","Thirukkural is considered one of the great works ever on ethics and morality.

""This will enable our private industry to step up R&D efforts, build production lines and assemblies to meet the requirements in a desired timeframe,"" it said.As per the roadmap, which specifies over 200 weapon systems and futuristic technologies, the armed forces require around 150 stealth unmanned combat aerial vehicles, among other types of drones, and over 500 hypersonic missiles with scramjet propulsion in the coming years as well as measures to counter them.The Navy wants nuclear-propulsion for at least 10 of its future warships, including an aircraft carrier, and 20 high-endurance autonomous underwater vehicles for anti-submarine warfare. The Army, in turn, requires 1,700-1,800 next-generation main-battle tanks as well as 400 light tanks for mountain warfare, while the IAF wants 20 stratospheric airships for surveillance, intelligence-gathering and communications, among other capabilities.Most of the capabilities listed out in the new roadmap are already known but presented in a consolidated format for the industry as a ready reckoner. ""The cardinal need to embrace self-reliance (Atmanirbharata) along all stages of design and development cannot be further stressed upon,"" the roadmap stated.","The new 'technology perspective capability roadmap' conveys key requirements of the over 14-lakh strong armed forces.

NEW DELHI: Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) and Infrastructure Investment Trusts (InvITs) are coming after age in India as a mainstream asset class and are playing “a pivotal role” in driving growth in these two sectors, according to the Indian REITs Association and Bharat InvITs Association. India currently has five publicly listed REITs — Brookfield India Real Estate Trust, Embassy Office Parks REIT, Mindspace Business Parks REIT, Nexus Select Trust and Knowledge Realty Trust. And of the 27 SEBI-registered InvITs, five are publicly listed. Both REITs and InvITs are regulated by SEBI.Terming REITs as a”critical bridge between physical real estate and financial markets,” Alok Aggarwal, MD & CEO of Brookfield India Real Estate Trust and chairman of the Indian REITs Association, said here Friday: “India’s REIT market has moved beyond its early phase to become a reliable investment avenue for both institutional and retail investors. Since their inception, the first four REITs have distributed more than Rs 24,300 crore to unit holders, demonstrating steady cash generation and disciplined governance. Building on this foundation, now five listed REITs command a combined market capitalisation of about Rs 1.5 lakh crore, reflecting growing confidence in the asset class and its ability to deliver stable, predictable distributions.” By regulation, REITs are required to distribute at least 90% of their net distributable cash flows to unit holders on a half-yearly basis.Bharat InvITs Association CEO N S Venkatesh said: “InvITs have emerged as a structured and transparent investment platform, well-suited to India's evolving infrastructure financing needs. They have created a distinct and credible asset class that brings long-term capital into infrastructure while offering stable returns to investors. The InvIT industry in India has witnessed significant growth, with 27 InvITs registered and cumulative distributions of over Rs 68,000 crore made since inception, underscoring its scale, stability, and increasing investor confidence. With increasing participation from diverse investor categories and a strong regulatory oversight and support from SEBI, InvITs are poised to play an integral role in supporting India’s infrastructure goals.”","'reits & invits coming of age as mainstream asset class in india' - associations.

Boxing earnings fuel Manny Pacquiao’s massive fortune

Endorsements amplify Manny Pacquiao’s global brand

Political career adds to Manny Pacquiao’s influence but not wealth

Manny Pacquiao, the Filipino boxing star, had built a vast fortune by 2025, inspiring millions around the world. His net worth is around $220 million, thanks to his incredible journey from a poor kid to a global hero. Known as “PacMan,” he made money through boxing, brand deals, and politics.Manny Pacquiao's boxing career is the biggest reason for his massive wealth, earning him millions over the years. As the only boxer to win world titles in eight weight classes, he made about $575 million from his fights. His 2015 fight against Floyd Mayweather alone brought in $130 million. His 25 pay-per-view fights earned $1.3 billion total, proving how popular he is worldwide.Even at the age of 46, Pacquiao keeps fighting, like his July 2025 draw against Mario Barrios, which earned him around $12.5 million. His exciting style and wins against stars like Miguel Cotto and Oscar De La Hoya made him a fan favorite. Pay-per-view shares also added to his fortune, making him one of the richest boxers ever. His hard work in the ring built a strong financial foundation for his life.Also Read: Manny Pacquiao dares to defy age with bold move to steal Mario Barrios' WBC title Pacquiano became a target of major brands due to his fame, and his net worth was boosted by endorsements to the tune of millions.During his prime, companies such as Nike, Nestlé, and Hennessy paid him annually between 2 and 5 million dollars. In his fight with Mayweather, companies such as Paramount Pictures and Smart Communications also purchased advertising space on his shorts to the tune of $300,000 apiece. In 2016, Nike dumped him, and he joined the Chinese ANATA brand.Being a clean image and with a massive following, and more so in the Philippines, he was ideal for marketing. He, too, began Manny Pacquiao Promotions to help the young boxers, which is another source of revenue. Team Pacquiao Coffee and real estate are other business activities that contribute to his wealth. These transactions demonstrate how Pacquiao has built his brand of fame beyond the boxing ring. Together, these ventures highlight the boxing legend Pacquiao’s sharp business mindset and ability to turn fame into a mega fortune. His journey was tough, but it also proves that his legacy extends far beyond the boxing arena.Pacquiao earned some respect through his work in politics, but could not significantly contribute to his wealth as compared to boxing. He represented the Philippines in the Senate between 2016 and 2022 and made approximately $40,000 a year, a modest sum when compared to his fight purse. His 2022 presidential campaign and 2025 Senate bid were not successful, but kept him in the limelight. These positions made his image, but they were not mega-grossers.He pays it back through his Manny Pacquiao Foundation, where he finances homes and scholarships to the poor. He also has a Beverly Hills mansion worth $12.5 million and houses in the Philippines. Politics did not make him wealthy; however, it reinforced his reputation as a popular personality. The combination of charity, investments, and service to the people demonstrates that he left a non-monetary legacy.","Manny pacquiao, the filipino boxing star, had built a vast fortune by 2025.

Steve Ballmer denies salary cap circumvention allegations

Steve Ballmer denies report that Clippers circumvented NBA’s salary cap [FULL INTERVIEW]

Steve Ballmer is adamant about having done the ""right thing""

The world of NBA was quite stunned when investigative journalist Pablo Torre revealed a report on the Los Angeles Clippers, their owner Steve Ballmer, and their star forward, Kawhi Leonard. The salary cap circumvention controversy has caught the eye of everyone, and the NBA is also launching an investigation into the matter. The Clippers as well as Ballmer have denied any wrongdoing on their part, and are open to said investigation. And now Steve Ballmer has doubled down on his stance in the matter, denying any involvement on his part.Steve Ballmer recently sat down for an interview, where he vehemently denied the allegations against him as well as the Los Angeles Clippers, being involved in salary cap circumvention. He did not arrange any ""no-show"" endorsement deal between the fintech company, Aspiration and Clippers player Kawhi Leonard. Ballmer told ESPN SportsCenter:""We made an investment in the company. All fine. I had no control over this company. This is important under the salary cap rules. I owned less than three percent of the company. There were investors who put in a lot more money than I did. I had no board seat. I had no control. Heck, it was a fraudulent company. It's possible nobody had control.""He further added:""At that time, we hadn't introduced Kawhi to Aspiration. We were done with Kawhi. We were done with Aspiration. The deals were all locked and loaded.Then they did ask to be introduced to Kawhi. Under the rules, we can introduce our sponsors to our athletes. We just can't be involved. We made an introduction. ... Where could any of this circumvention have happened? It didn't. It couldn't have.""But given Ballmer invested $50 million into the company, all eyes are on him and the Clippers as the NBA begins their investigation on this matter.Throughout the interview, Steve Ballmer was adamant that he and the Clippers had always done what was right. He said that they are looking forward to the investigation, so that things can be clear for everyone and it can be proven that there was no wrongdoing on their part. His priority is the Clipper fans, and he wants to show them that ""We've really emphasized on doing things the right way,"" without taking any shortcuts.He wants his fans to know that they are an up-and-up organization, that does things the ""right way,"" and he hopes after the investigation is done, it can all be put to rest. He was very adamant about them following every rule in the NBA, and continuously kept denying any involvement with Kawhi Leonard's $28 million 4-year endorsement deal with the fintech company.He also added that he made introductions between Leonard and Aspiration, but had no involvement in the deal. In fact, he said he didn't even know there was a deal between the two parties. Pointing out the company's fraudulent nature, he said he has no idea why any of it happened, and he is just as bewildered by the situation as anyone else.Also Read: Kawhi Leonard endorsement controversy gains another spark after Toronto Raptors deal come to light","Los angeles clippers owner steve ballmer has denied any involvement in salary cap circumvention.

Why Mitesh Khapra is named in Time AI 100 list

Time Magazine recently unveiled its 2025 list of 100 tech CEOs, founders, leaders and other executives. The list featured prominent names like Tesla CEO Elon Musk , OpenAI CEO Sam Altman , Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg and others. One name that stood out this year was Mitesh Khapra , an Associate Professor at Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras. Khapra was recognised for his efforts to make AI accessible to millions of non-English speakers in India.Mitesh Khapra is an Associate Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the IIT Madras. According to his Linkedin profile, he has worked with Infosys and LG as a software engineer. He then jumped to research roles with Microsoft India and IBM before joining IIT Madras in 2016.Khapra is also a co-founder of One Fourth Labs where the mission is to provide high quality education in AI at affordable prices to build a workforce capable of building AI solutions of societal and commercial value in India. Mitesh describes Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and Conversation Systems as his specialities.As per information available on Time100 AI collections page, Mitesh Khapra recognized early on that “the reason Indian language technology is behind English is because we do not have enough data for Indian languages,” he says.While Western models may perform well on highly represented languages like Hindi and Bengali, they are weaker on underrepresented languages. To close the gap, Khapra’s research lab AI4Bharat led a project that took researchers to almost 500 of India’s 700 districts, recording thousands of hours of voices from people with diverse educational and socioeconomic backgrounds to capture all 22 of India’s official languages.Co-founded in 2019, AI4Bharat became an official partner for the Indian government’s Bhashini program, which uses AI to assist citizens in accessing digital services in their own languages; AI4Bharat supplies 80% of the data with its open-source dataset. It welcomes other developers utilizing its data for their models, too. Khapra says that if big tech companies use its data to make their models better at Hindi or Marathi, “it benefits the country at large.”AI4Bharat’s AI models have been deployed in the Indian Supreme Court to translate official documents, and to create a voice bot that regional farmers can call to report issues with their government subsidy payments. The company’s latest project involves partnering with Sarvam AI—a startup launched by two other AI4Bharat co-founders—to build India’s first foundation model for the Indian government. Even if the model initially underperforms its Western counterparts, Khapra sees its creation as essential for the country’s sovereignty. “Unless we learn that skill, we will always be in a perpetually dependent position,” he says.Already Khapra sees his work helping to reshape his nation’s academic research. He says that ""15 years back, an average PhD student in India working on language technology would end up working on English problems,” but adds that “with these datasets available, I see a shift: now Indian students are working on Indian problems.""",Mitesh khapra was recognised for his efforts to make ai accessible to millions of non-english speakers in india.

The NFL Fantasy Football app suffered a major outage during the much-awaited season opener between the Kansas City Chiefs and Baltimore Ravens. The players were unable to track their scores, make roster changes or follow live updates due to the outage. Many players took to social media platforms to report about the outage. Many users complained that they were not able to log in, view matchups or see player stats. The outage tracker sites also showed a sharp spike in error reports during the first quarter.Frustrated fantasy managers took to X (formerly Twitter) to voice their anger, with some calling it the “worst possible timing” for a crash. Many pointed out that the first game of the NFL season is one of the busiest nights for fantasy activity, as players make last-minute lineup changes and monitor early performances.“Today @NFLFantasy website and app crashed in the middle of my leagues draft. Completely unacceptable. As a commissioner he’s my comments on this monstrosity,” posted a user.“@NFL this is the 4th year in a row where the fantasy app doesn't work on the day i draft and just doesnt let me log in, plz fix this plese,” wrote another user.NFL acknowledged the technical issue in a statement and also said that the engineers are working to resolve the issue.

Apple's Secret 3-Year Plan: A New iPhone Era is Coming!

Apple’s lead AI researcher for robotics Zian Jhang has left the company to join Meta. According to a Bloomberg report, Jian Zhang has joined the Meta Robotics Studio on September 2. As per the report, three other AI researchers have left Apple’s in-house large language models (LLMs) team. Citing unnamed sources speaking on the condition of anonymity, the report said that these three employees include John Peebles, Nan Du and Zhao Meng. They were all part of an Apple Foundation Models team. While Pebbles and Du are joining OpenAI , Meng is reportedly heading to Anthropic.So far, Apple has lost roughly 10 employees, including chief of the company’s Foundation Models team. The group was central to the creation of the Apple Intelligence platform . According to Bloomberg news, the iPhone maker is now discussing internally whether to rely more on outside technology, rather than just homegrown models.Jian Zhang, a robotics researcher, led a small team of academics studying automation technology at Apple and how AI is used in it. The team has already seen some changes, as one of Zhang’s team members, Mario Srouji, left in April to lead AI products at Archer Aviation Inc.Zhang worked with Apple for nearly 10 years. His previous works, according to his LinkedIn profile include Lecturer at Purdue University and Research Intern at Mitsubishi Electric. Zhang holds a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering and studied at University of Washington under student exchange program. He completed his Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Engineering from Purdue University.According to a Financial Times report, many recruiters see the recent wave of departures from Apple as a “crisis of confidence” in the company’s AI plans. Apple is still working on a more advanced AI version of Siri, expected next year, but it stumbled when the new Apple Intelligence version of Siri was delayed and didn’t make it into iOS 18.At an employee meeting in August, Apple’s software chief Craig Federighi said the company has built a new Siri system that will bring big improvements in 2026.Apple is also exploring outside partners to boost Siri’s AI, holding talks with OpenAI, Anthropic, and Google.

I grow little of the food I eat, and of the little I do grow I did not breed or perfect the seeds.

I do not make any of my own clothing. I speak a language I did not invent or refine. I did not discover the mathematics I use. I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate.

I am moved by music I did not create myself. When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive. I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with.I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being.

Gmail Warning: That Urgent Security Notification from Google May Be a Trap

Eugene Ling , a former sales employee at Scale AI, has issued a public apology to his current team and employer, Mercor , after a report emerged that his ex-company is suing them. The lawsuit, filed two months after Scale AI secured a massive $14.3 billion investment from Mark Zuckerberg's Meta, accuses Ling of stealing confidential documents containing customer strategies and other proprietary information.“Just heard I’m getting sued by Scale. Last month, I left Scale to work at Mercor. I know this was frustrating for my old team, and I feel bad about that,” Ling said in a post.Ling also denies any “nefarious intent.” He stated that after leaving Scale, he asked his former employer if he could delete files from his personal drive, but was instructed not to.“When Scale reached out about some files I had in my personal drive, I asked if I could just delete them. But Scale asked that I not do anything with them, so I’m still waiting for guidance on how to resolve this. I’ve never used any of them in this role. It sounds like Scale wants to sue me and that’s up to them,” he said.“I’m really sorry to my new team at Mercor for having to deal with this,” he added.Ling’s post that came after a report by TechCrunch said that Scale AI’s lawsuit alleges that Ling ""stole more than 100 confidential documents concerning Scale’s customer strategies and other proprietary information"" and attempted to poach one of Scale’s largest clients for Mercor.Surya Midha, co-founder of Mercor, told the publication that Ling may have had possession of the documents but denied that his company had used any of the data.“We have no interest in any of Scale’s trade secrets and in fact are intentionally running our business in a different way,” Midha said. He also revealed that Mercor had reached out to Scale AI days before the lawsuit was filed, offering to have Ling destroy the files.Scale AI's lawsuit claims that the stolen documents contained data that would have allowed Mercor to serve several of its most important clients, including a major customer, referred to in the suit as ""Customer A."" Scale alleges that winning this client away would be “worth millions of dollars to Mercor.”The legal action comes just weeks after Meta's significant investment in Scale AI. Zuckerberg’s company now holds 49% of Scale AI and also hired its CEO Alexandr Wang as well as some other employees as part of the deal.

Nepal has ordered a ban on 26 social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and X, after they failed to register with the government within a seven-day deadline.The decision comes in line with a Supreme Court directive and a ministerial meeting held on Thursday that included Communications and Information Technology Minister Prithvi Subba Gurung, ministry officials, the Nepal Telecommunication Authority, telecom operators and internet service providers.According to officials, restrictions will apply nationwide with immediate effect, and the ministry has begun issuing letters to the concerned companies. The government had earlier warned that non-compliant platforms would face suspension.While Viber, TikTok, Wetalk and Nimbuzz are registered, and Telegram and Global Diary are in the process, major platforms such as Facebook, Twitter (X), WhatsApp, Reddit, LinkedIn and YouTube have yet to initiate registration. Officials said services may resume once platforms complete the registration process and comply with national rules.“The Honourable Supreme Court, in a contempt of court case (Case No. 080-8-0012), has issued a directive order in the name of the Government of Nepal to mandatorily list domestic or foreign-origin online and social media platforms with the relevant authorities before operation and to evaluate and monitor unwanted content.In accordance with the decision of the Government of Nepal (Council of Ministers) dated 2082.05.09, for the implementation of the said order, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology has published a public notice on 2082.05.12, giving a deadline of seven (7) days to list social media platforms as per the 'Directive on Regulating the Use of Social Media, 2080'. All stakeholders are hereby informed that the Nepal Telecommunication Authority has been directed to deactivate social media platforms within Nepal that have not contacted the Ministry for listing within the specified time limit and to reactivate them from the same moment if they are listed,” a notice issued by the ministry reads.The ministry added that all other major social media and communication platforms, including Messenger, Snapchat, Discord, Pinterest, Signal, Threads, WeChat, Quora, Tumblr, Clubhouse, Rumble, Mi Video, Mi Vike, Line, Imo, Jalo, Sol and Hamro Patro, will also be blocked until they complete registration.The Supreme Court issued its mandamus order on Wednesday, nearly five years after writ petitions were filed seeking restrictions on advertisements and content broadcast via unlicensed social media platforms, OTT apps and internet browsers. A joint bench of Justices Tek Prasad Dhungana and Shanti Singh Thapa heard three petitions together and ruled in favour of the petitioners.In December 2020, advocates B.P. Gautam and Anita Bajgain had filed writs demanding a ban on unrestricted broadcasts, including foreign advertisements, through social media. Manoj Gurung, General Secretary of the Nepal Cable Television Federation, filed a similar petition. The court consolidated the cases before issuing the mandamus, directing that unlicensed platforms must stop broadcasting advertisements and content without legal approval.Government spokesperson and Minister for Communications and Information Technology Prithvi Subba Gurung told the National Assembly on August 19 that Meta, the parent company of Facebook, was repeatedly urged to register in Nepal but responded that it was not ready to comply with Nepal’s laws and constitution.According to the ministry’s notice, operational platforms must register with the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, designate contact points in Nepal, appoint officials to handle local complaints and assign compliance monitoring officers.","The decision comes in line with a supreme court directive and a ministerial meeting held on thursday.
