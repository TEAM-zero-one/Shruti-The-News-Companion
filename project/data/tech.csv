Nina Lin & Zoe Spencer Unbanned On Twitch One Day After Alleged Sexual Assault Ban

Streamers Disguised Toast and Valkyrae react to Nina Lin’s return





Nina Lin, a popular Twitch streamer, has been unbanned on Twitch after a one-week suspension that stirred a huge debate online. Her channel was first banned on October 24, 2025, after videos from a May 2024 live stream showed her and another streamer, Zoe Spencer, touching a production team member named Said without his consent. The incident led to serious accusations of sexual harassment and drew massive backlash across the Twitch community.At first, Twitch lifted Nina Lin’s ban just one day later, on October 25, which made many users angry. They felt the platform acted too quickly to forgive her. When more old clips surfaced showing similar behavior, Twitch banned her again on October 30. Now, after one week, her channel has been unbanned, but the controversy around her name still hasn’t gone away. Many viewers and streamers are still upset with Twitch, saying the company isn’t handling such serious behavior properly.Famous Twitch streamers like Disguised Toast and Valkyrae spoke out about Nina Lin’s actions and Twitch’s handling of the bans. Disguised Toast shared that he once felt uncomfortable when Nina Lin interrupted his massage during a sponsored event and touched him without permission.Valkyrae also said she felt uneasy watching the video of Nina and Zoe Spencer touching Said during the FaZe Clan live stream.Nina Lin later apologized during a live stream, saying she thought it was all a joke and did not mean to hurt anyone. But many viewers didn’t accept her apology, saying what happened was serious and not something to be laughed off.After her first ban was lifted too soon, many creators, including Disguised Toast, said Twitch needed to take such incidents more seriously. They asked for stricter rules to make sure everyone, creators, fans, and production staff, feel safe during live events.Also Read: Sneako Admires Zohran Mamdani And Wife Rama Duwaji’s Real Love And The Internet Falls For Their Charm Right now, Nina Lin’s channel is visible again, but it is still under review for breaking Twitch’s community guidelines.

How Jeevan Pramaan simplifies pensioner verification







Every year, lakhs of pensioners across India must prove that they are still alive to continue receiving their pension. This verification, known as the Life Certificate or Digital Life Certificate (DLC), is a crucial and mandatory step in ensuring that pension payments are made only to eligible recipients, preventing fraud and misuse.Traditionally, this process involved visiting the bank or pension office in person, standing in long queues, and submitting a signed paper certificate. However, with the government’s focus on digitisation and technological advancement, this process has become much simpler, faster, and more convenient. Pensioners can now submit their certificates digitally from the comfort of their homes using Jeevan Pramaan, a secure, user-friendly, and Aadhaar-based platform.A Life Certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive. Without it, pension payments are automatically paused by the pension disbursing agency. This verification is essential for preventing fraudulent claims and ensuring that pensions reach the rightful beneficiaries.The Digital Life Certificate (DLC), also known as Jeevan Pramaan, is an advanced biometric-enabled version of the traditional paper certificate.Introduced by the Government of India, it uses Aadhaar-based biometric authentication using either fingerprint or iris scan to verify a pensioner’s identity. Once verified, a digital certificate is automatically generated and shared with authorised pension disbursing agencies.This online process eliminates the need for physical verification, providing elderly pensioners with a simpler and more accessible way to maintain their pension benefits.According to PIB, The submission of the Life Certificate is mandatory for all pensioners who wish to continue receiving their pension without interruption. For the year 2025, the standard submission period is betweenTo make the process more comfortable for the elderly, the government allows pensioners aged 80 years and above to begin the submission process earlier, from 1 October 2025. This extended window gives senior citizens more time and flexibility to complete the procedure without facing last-minute difficulties.The Jeevan Pramaan process involves two main steps: registering the biometric device and generating the digital certificate.Before using the service, pensioners or operators must register their biometric device such as a fingerprint or iris scanner. During registration, the user provides their Aadhaar number and mobile number, after which an OTP (One-Time Password) is sent to their mobile. After entering the OTP, they must provide their name and email ID before scanning their fingerprint or iris.Once authentication is complete, the system confirms that device registration was successful, allowing the user to move to the next step.In this step, the pensioner enters personal details such as Aadhaar number, mobile number, name, PPO number, pension type, sanctioning authority, disbursing agency, and bank account details. The system also asks whether the pensioner has remarried or is re-employed.After entering all details, the pensioner scans their fingerprint or iris using the registered biometric device. Upon successful authentication, the Digital Life Certificate is generated, and an SMS acknowledgment with the Jeevan Pramaan Certificate ID is sent to the registered mobile number.This certificate is automatically stored in the Life Certificate Repository, accessible anytime to both pensioners and pension agencies.Once the Digital Life Certificate is created, it can be electronically delivered to the concerned Pension Disbursing Agency (PDA). PDAs can log in to the Jeevan Pramaan portal to view, verify, or download the certificate directly.Pensioners can also download a PDF copy of their certificate by visiting the Jeevan Pramaan website and entering their Pramaan ID or Aadhaar number. This ensures transparency and easy access for future reference.The government provides several options to submit the Life Certificate, allowing pensioners to choose the method that suits them best.Pensioners who prefer traditional methods can visit their bank branch or a Citizen Service Centre (CSC) to submit their Life Certificate physically. Trained staff at these centres assist pensioners in verifying their details and completing the process.For those unable to travel due to age or health issues, India Post Payments Bank (IPPB) offers a doorstep banking service. Pensioners can schedule an appointment, and an IPPB representative will visit their home to complete the submission using biometric authentication. This service is available for both IPPB and non-IPPB account holders.For pensioners comfortable with technology, the Jeevan Pramaan portal provides a completely online process. By visiting https://jeevanpramaan.gov.in, pensioners can submit their Digital Life Certificate using a computer, laptop, or smartphone equipped with a fingerprint or iris scanner.The system uses the Aadhaar platform to authenticate biometric details. Once verification is successful, a Digital Life Certificate is generated and stored in a secure online repository. Pension disbursing agencies can then directly access the certificate, removing the need for physical paperwork.The UMANG (Unified Mobile Application for New-age Governance) app offers another easy option. Pensioners can download the app from the Google Play Store, search for “Jeevan Pramaan,” and select “Generate Life Certificate.”After entering the necessary details such as Aadhaar number, PPO number, and type of pension, pensioners must authenticate themselves using biometric verification. The app then generates a Digital Life Certificate (DLC), which is automatically shared with the pension disbursing authority.All pensioners who receive government, defence, or private sector pensions through authorised disbursing agencies are required to submit their Life Certificate every year. This includes:Failure to submit the certificate within the stipulated period may result in temporary suspension of pension payments until verification is completed.To ensure a smooth submission process, pensioners should keep certain details and documents ready. These include:Having these details ready helps to avoid delays or errors during authentication, whether submitting online or offline.Yes, an Aadhaar number or Virtual ID (VID) is mandatory to generate a Digital Life Certificate. The entire Jeevan Pramaan system is based on Aadhaar authentication, which ensures accuracy and prevents fraud. Pensioners must make sure their Aadhaar is linked with their mobile number and bank account before attempting to generate the certificate.The Digital Life Certificate is fully valid and legally recognised under the Information Technology Act. Pension disbursing authorities across India accept it as an official document, equivalent to the traditional paper-based life certificate.Its biometric verification system makes it secure and tamper-proof, reducing the chances of wrongful pension disbursal or misuse of pension funds.Before the introduction of Jeevan Pramaan, pensioners often faced difficulties in submitting their certificates, especially those with health problems or limited mobility. The digital system has removed these challenges, allowing pensioners to submit their verification anytime and anywhere.By integrating biometric technology and Aadhaar authentication, Jeevan Pramaan has streamlined pension management, improving efficiency for both pensioners and government departments. It also enhances transparency and ensures that genuine beneficiaries receive payments on time.","A life certificate is an official document that confirms a pensioner is alive.

'Don't lecture about Indian literacy rates': American CEO James Fishback's jibe at Vivek Ramaswamy,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dont-lecture-about-indian-literacy-rates-american-ceo-james-fishbacks-jibe-at-vivek-ramaswamy/articleshow/125161003.cms,"CEO James Fishback took a veiled dig at Vivek Ramaswamy as he mentioned India, maths olympiad in his recent America First speech.





Azoria CEO and ex-DOGE architect James Fishback took a dig at GOP leader Vivek Ramaswamy without naming him and said Americans should not be apologetic about who they are and nobody should lecture Americans on India's literacy or Chinese maths. Americans won't change their culture for a maths olympiad or for a Chemistry exam, Fishback said as he was giving a speech at Boston University College Republicans. The ex-DOGE architect has emerged as a strong anti-H-1B voice.""We don't want ANYONE lecturing us about Indian literacy rates or Chinese math rates. Cut the crap now. We’re Americans. We’re talented. We’re smart. And no, we’re not giving up church on Sunday for more math tutoring. We’re not skipping Friday Night Lights because there’s a chemistry test to cram for. The second we stop apologizing for who we are, we will start winning again!"" Fishback said.The America First CEO has been pushing for completely stopping the H-1B visa program and said that a foreigner should only come to the US for tourism.Fishback's reference to math tutoring, chemistry test was a jibe at Indian-origin Republican leader Vivek Ramaswamy who last year created a major uproar in the H-1B controversy as he attacked American culture to justify the H-1B program.Ramaswamy said American culture worships mediocrity over excellence, celebrates prom queen over math olympiad and hence tech companies need to hire foreign employees as there is a dearth of Americans in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics.While Vivek's critique of American culture turned out to be a watershed moment for MAGA, with Vivek becoming sidelined, the H-1B conundrum still persists. The Donald Trump administration has imposed a $100,000 fee on hiring H-1Bs, making it difficult for tech companies to hire from foreign countries. Florida has recently announced a ban on H-1Bs in Florida colleges and universities as Governor Ron DeSantis revealed that instead of special positions, the colleges and universities made foreign hiring for some very basic posts, like a public policy professor from China, a graphic designer from Canada.","Azoria ceo and ex-doge architect james fishback took a dig at gop leader vivek ramaswamy without naming him.

NEW DELHI: Zerodha co-founder Nikhil Kamath has questioned the value of traditional higher education, especially MBA programs, saying that, ""colleges are dead.""Speaking during Zerodha’s 15th anniversary discussion, co-founder Nikhil Kamath said that formal education is being rapidly outpaced by open and digital learning platforms.""Colleges are dead.

Kamath argued that such confidence shouldn’t come at such a high cost.He also pointed out that major global firms are already moving away from degree-based hiring.""When large companies like Meta or Apple say that qualifications don’t matter in job applications, it’s only a matter of time before that approach trickles down here,"" he said, ET reported.While acknowledging that some colleges still offer valuable mentorship, Kamath said such institutions are rare in India.He further predicted that vocational and skill-based learning will soon surpass traditional degrees as companies increasingly prioritize practical expertise over formal qualifications.","Zerodha co-founder nikhil kamath has questioned the value of traditional higher education, especially mba programs.

What is the conflict over Apple CarPlay Ultra

Apple's Secret 3-Year Plan: A New iPhone Era is Coming!





Ford CEO Jim Farley has joined a list of auto makers who are raising concerns about Apple’s expanding control over in-car systems through its new CarPlay Ultra platform. “We don’t like the execution of Ultra in round one,” Farley told The Verge, adding “I’ve talked to Tim [Cook] many times about this. Ford does not have the right, in our opinion, to disrupt someone’s digital life when they get in their car”.Farley further warned that Apple needs to make a decision on how much it wants to encroach into a vehicle system. “How far do you want the Apple brand to go? Do you want the Apple brand to start the car? Do you want the Apple brand to limit the speed? Do you want the Apple brand to limit access?”, a furious Farley question.“The difference between car companies where you have a software-defined vehicle is not going to be what your sheet metal looks like. It won’t be how powerful your EV motor is. That’s all math. All the cars look nice. It’s going to be this digital experience that says why someone buys this or that,” he further said.Introduced earlier this year, Apple CarPlay Ultra is the latest generation of CarPlay, enabling Apple iPhone users to display car functions like fuel level and speed.Other than mirroring iPhone’s screen, CarPlay also lets drivers control the air conditioning, radio, and driving modes, all from the same screen.Currently, only Aston Martin is the only automaker that has fully integrated CarPlay Ultra into its vehicles. According to a Financial Times report, other automakers, including Audi, Mercedes-Benz, Polestar, Volvo, Renault, and others have no plans to integrate the new system into their cars.But the conflict heated up when General Motors (GM) CEO Mary Barra said the company’s future vehicles will no longer support Apple CarPlay or its Google counterpart, Android Auto.","Ford ceo jim farley has joined a list of auto makers who are raising concerns about apple’s expanding control over in-car systems through its new carplay ultra platform. “we don’t like the execution of ultra in round one,” farley said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125135370,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-30830,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Scale AI CFO pushes back: “We are alive and well”





Mark Zuckerberg unveils three new Meta AI smart glasses

Business is still booming





Moving ahead without Alexandr Wang





Facebook-parent Meta stunned the Silicon Valley in June this year by announcing a $14.3 billion investment in AI startup — Scale AI. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made this investment to primarily onboard Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang and other top executives of the company. This move by Meta trigged an immediate speculation about the Scale AI’s viability, with major clients like OpenAI, Google, and Elon Musk’s xAI reportedly pausing work with the startup. The industry insiders also felt that the company had been effectively acquired, leaving its future uncertain. However, after almost five months after the investment made by Meta, Scale AI CFO Dennis Cinelli has pushed back this speculation. Speaking to CNBC in an interview, Cinelli said that ‘We are a company that signed some of the best deals we have had in the history of our company, just in the last two or three months. We are not a Zombie.”Emphasising on the fact that Scale AI has signed some of its best deals in recent months, Cinelli told CNBC, “We’re not a zombie company,”. Along with this, he also dismissed the claims that the investment made by Meta was a licensing or acquihire deal.He emphasised that Scale AI is still an independent and completely operational.Founded in 2016, ScaleAI is known for its data-labelling services and custom AI applications for governments and enterprises. Cinelli told CNBC that both the divisions of the company are growing with revenue “well into the nine figures.” He also revealed that Scale AI recently secured two major contracts with the US Department of Defense which value $99 million and $100 million in August and September, respectively.Scale AI fired about 14% of its workforce in July, soon after Meta made the investment of $14.3 billion, but the company started the process of hiring and has hired 200 new employees. Along with this, the AI company is also working on expansion and is opening new offices in New York, Washington D.C., St. Louis, and London. Despite alls this, the San Francisco still remains the largest hub of the company where it is occupying 180,000 square feet of former Airbnb space.The departure of Alexandr Wang from the company was considered to a major loss. He was the world’s youngest self-made billionaire until October but Cinelli insists the “vast majority” of employees remain. Facebook-parent Meta now owns 49% stake in ScaleAIwhich is valued around $29 billion, but the company has no voting power or product integration. “Scale’s data business has grown every month since the Meta deal, and its applications business has doubled in the second half of 2025 compared with the first half. Scale expects the applications unit to be the primary revenue driver for the company in the future,” Cenelli told CNBC.",Scale ai cfo pushes back: “we are alive and well” facebook-parent meta made a $14.3 billion investment in ai startup scale ai.

US Shutdown Triggers Massive Political War, Trump Mulls Mass Layoffs; Dems Call Move 'Dirty Trick'





Online job search platform Indeed is reportedly eliminating a very small number of roles, Business Insider reports. The latest job cuts come four months after the company announced to lay off over 100 employees in July earlier this year. The BI report quotes a statement from Indeed where it says “To better align our team structure with business priorities, we've reorganized several functions and made the difficult decision to eliminate a very small number of roles”.However, no details about the roles impacted are known yet.As part of an ongoing restructuring effort by its parent company – Japan’s Recruit Holdings, Indeed has reduced its global workforce to around 11,000 employees. As mentioned above, in July, Indeed and its sister company Glassdoor together laid off about 1,300 employees. The cuts then mainly affected the US-based teams working in research, people operations, and sustainability.In an internal email to staff at the time, Recruit Holdings and Indeed CEO Hisayuki “Deko” Idekoba said, “AI is changing the world” and stressed the need for the company to evolve quickly. “Delivering on this ambition requires us to move faster, try new things, and fix what's broken,” Idekoba wrote. “To achieve our company priorities, it requires creating a structure and culture to support them.”This marks the second round of layoffs at Indeed in two years. In May 2024, the company had already let go of around 1,000 employees, or about 8% of its workforce at the time.","The online job search platform indeed is reportedly eliminating a very small number of roles.

University of Pennsylvania cyber attack: Data worth million exposed





The University of Pennsylvania has confirmed that hackers gained access to several of its internal systems linked to development and alumni activities, stealing confidential data in the process, reports BleepingComputer. The breach, discovered on October 31, occurred after attackers obtained employee credentials through a social engineering scam.""Penn employs a robust information security program; however, access to these systems occurred due to a sophisticated identity impersonation commonly known as social engineering,"" the university said in a statement.The university said its staff quickly locked down the affected systems to stop further intrusions but not before an “offensive and fraudulent email” was sent to members of the Penn community.The university further revealed that it has alerted the FBI and is working with cybersecurity firm CrowdStrike to investigate the incident.According to BleepingComputer’s report, the attackers accessed Penn’s Salesforce donor database, SharePoint files, and other platforms, stealing around 1.71 GB of data. This includes sensitive personal and financial information of alumni and donors such as names, addresses, phone numbers, email IDs, and donation histories.The hackers claimed to have obtained records of roughly 1.2 million donors, including details like “gift histories, wealth ratings, and lifetime commitment amounts.” They also said they sent a mass email to nearly 700,000 people after discovering their access was revoked.The attackers told BleepingComputer that the breach wasn’t politically motivated but aimed at Penn’s “vast, wonderfully wealthy donor database.” However, their communications also included sharp criticism of the university’s diversity, equity, and inclusion policies.The university says it is now strengthening its security systems, conducting staff training on social engineering, and enhancing monitoring tools.Once the probe concludes, Penn plans to notify affected individuals. The university has also urged students, alumni, and donors to stay alert for suspicious emails or phone calls that could be phishing attempts.","University of pennsylvania has confirmed that hackers gained access to several of its internal systems linked to development and alumni activities.

After Labubus: Why are people camping outside Starbucks and fighting over the 'Bearista Cup?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/after-labubus-why-are-people-camping-outside-starbucks-and-fighting-over-the-bearista-cup/articleshow/125165123.cms,"The 20-ounce glass Bearista cup, priced at US$29.95, sold out within minutes, leaving fans camping outside Starbucks stores overnight without success/ Image: X

A cuddly cup that brewed chaos

“HAPPENING NOW: WHEN IT'S 5 A.M. AND THE DRAMA’S ALREADY BREWING! Deputies were called for a rather unique disturbance — several individuals refusing to leave the store and fighting… over a new ‘Bearista’ cup! Deputies are on scene, restoring peace before anyone spilled their latte or lost their teddy bear.”

Starbucks Bearista Cold Cup sold out in seconds

“The excitement for our merchandise exceeded even our biggest expectations. Despite shipping more Bearista cups to coffeehouses than almost any other merchandise item this holiday season, the Bearista cup and some other items sold out fast.”

“We understand many customers were excited about the Bearista cup and apologise for the disappointment this may have caused.”

Fans camp out, miss out and speak out

“I find it quite disappointing that a big company like Starbucks would release a new collection that clearly generates hype and inevitably, frustration,” wrote one Instagram user. “I’m sorry, but this time the disappointment has real consequences. There are plenty of alternatives out there, and many of us feel let down.”

“I think I have a better chance at winning the lottery than I do obtaining this cute bear cup,” another quipped.

“This was a waste of my time,” a commenter said. “The

Bearistas

were sold out before the doors even opened and other stores only had about two.”

“I went to four stores, the first one opened at 4:30. I saw the barista put out two cups and then bought both before anyone else could.

The other three stores only got one each, and one didn’t get any. This was all before 5:30 in the morning.”

“I got up at 4 a.m. and drove to a location that specifically said it would have this cup. I was first in line, they didn’t have it. I drove to four more stores, none of them had it and said they never did,”

“Please don’t market something so heavily if people don’t even have the option to actually purchase it; it has the opposite effect of what you’re hoping for,” wrote one frustrated customer.

“Not cool marketing, Starbucks, to only have 1–2 at each store and allow your baristas to buy them before customers. You should have had at least 10–20 for each location.”

“Basically advertising a non-existent product. It’s really unbelievable,”

“give Starbucks their money”

“Send more than two cups to each store; y’all are creating unnecessary excitement.”

From cute collectible to resale goldmine

“Please restock the Bear cup. No one wants to buy for $300.”





Starbucks’ seasonal tradition





Just as the world was recovering from the Labubu frenzy, another collectible craze has stirred the internet into a froth, this time, in the form of a teddy bear-shaped glass cup from Starbucks. The new “Bearista” cold cup, part of the coffee chain’s 2025 holiday collection, has proven so wildly popular that fans have camped out overnight, brawled in stores, and flooded social media with complaints, forcing Starbucks to issue an official apology.Released on 6 November 2025 alongside Starbucks’ festive drinks menu, the Glass Starbucks Bearista Cold Cup is a 20-ounce glass vessel moulded in the shape of a teddy bear. It features a green knitted Starbucks beanie, a reusable straw, and a price tag of US$29.95.The design, both nostalgic and charming, immediately caught the attention of collectors and Starbucks loyalists. Videos and photos of the cup, posted to the company’s own social channels on 5 November, went viral overnight.Within hours, fans were queueing before dawn in the hope of snagging one, some even waiting outside their local stores from 1 a.m.But the excitement quickly curdled into chaos. Reports emerged from across the United States of stores selling out within minutes, while some locations received as few as one or two cups. In Houston, deputies from Constable Mark Herman’s Office were called to a Starbucks to break up a fight between customers refusing to leave the store. The department’s Facebook post summed it up with bemused understatement:The incident underscored the scale of the mania. By sunrise, the Bearista had become the most talked-about piece of drinkware on the internet, and the most elusive.Starbucks later confirmed that the Bearista cups had sold out nationwide, acknowledging that demand had far outstripped supply. In an official statement, the company said:The company declined to specify how many cups were distributed per store, or whether restocks were planned, but promised that “more exciting merchandise” would arrive later in the holiday season.While Starbucks has long built its holiday releases into collectible events, from tumblers to snow globe mugs, the Bearista may have outpaced even the brand’s most optimistic projections. Fans who had queued for hours often found shelves empty or baristas informing them their branch hadn’t received any stock at all.For many, frustration quickly spilled onto social media. Comments under Starbucks’ official posts captured the collective dismay:Others shared elaborate tales of failed quests:said another.Others questioned the marketing logic:another person added.A few users, exasperated, joked that they wanted tobut couldn’t, while one simply pleaded:The scarcity only amplified the frenzy. Almost immediately after launch, Bearista cups began appearing on resale platforms at staggering mark-ups. Listings on eBay showed prices ranging from US$109 to US$275, while sellers on Mercari Japan were asking as much as US$150. One commenter summed up the sentiment succinctly:For collectors unwilling to pay such prices, others pointed out cheaper alternatives on Amazon and other retailers, including lookalike teddy-bear glass mugs that mimic the Bearista’s design.Meanwhile, some fans lamented that the overhyped drop had “done nothing but fuel resale at absurd prices, feeding a market that shouldn’t even exist.” Others joked that the fragile glass construction meant the few who did manage to secure one might not keep it intact for long.The Bearista joins a long line of Starbucks’ seasonal merchandise releases that tend to inspire both delight and exasperation in equal measure. Each holiday season, the Seattle-based chain unveils limited-edition designs alongside its much-loved drinks — this year including the Peppermint Mocha, Caramel Brulée Latte, Iced Sugar Cookie Latte, Iced Sugar Cookie Breve, and Iced Gingerbread Chai.However, this year’s Bearista launch highlighted how carefully orchestrated “drop culture” can misfire. Fans accused Starbucks of creating artificial scarcity, alleging that hyped marketing campaigns were not matched with fair distribution.For many, the frenzy over a simple glass bear has become a reminder that in the age of hype, even a coffee cup can brew more drama than a double espresso.","The 20-ounce glass bearista cup, priced at us$29.95, sold out within minutes.

Password for Louvre’s security system was ‘LOUVRE’ — and social media can’t stop laughing: ‘Not even L0uvr3?!’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/password-for-louvres-security-system-was-louvre-and-social-media-cant-stop-laughing-not-even-l0uvr3/articleshow/125117435.cms,"Watch: Louvre Jewels Stolen In Seconds: Thief Caught On Camera

Social media reactions:





A post-heist security audit has revealed shocking details about the Louvre’s cybersecurity, revealing that the password protecting France’s most famous museum’s video surveillance system was simply “LOUVRE. ”French newspaper Libération first reported the revelation.The revelations come weeks after the daring October 18 heist, in which thieves made off with crown jewels worth $102 million (£76 million) from the Galerie d’Apollon in broad daylight in a few minutes. The robbers entered via a balcony using a stolen mechanical lift, smashed display cases, and escaped.The findings about the security system are part of a wider trove of documents from the French National Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI), which has been auditing the museum’s systems for more than a decade.In a 2014 review, ANSSI warned that the Louvre’s IT systems that are responsible for alarms, access control, and video surveillance were dangerously vulnerable. “An attacker who manages to take control of it would be able to facilitate damage or even theft of artworks,” the report said.Cybersecurity advisor Javvad Malik of software firm KnowBe4 described the museum’s defences as “shockingly simplistic.” He told the Daily Mail, “The museum's video surveillance systems were protected by shockingly simplistic passwords.Whether this weakness played a role in the heist is still under review. But the lesson is clear. When systems safeguarding priceless cultural treasures rely on guessable credentials, it's not a policy gap – it is an invitation, serving as an indicator that the overall culture of security may be weak. ”Adding to the embarrassment, the report found the museum was still using outdated versions of Windows, which experts say is equivalent to “leaving your front door unlocked.” Later reviews, including those as recent as 2025, suggested the Louvre continued to suffer from major cybersecurity flaws.Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau told Franceinfo radio that the suspects were likely “petty criminals rather than professional members of an organised crime group.”The French daylight heist has since resulted in the endless ridicule of the Louvre across social media, including from billionaire CEO Elon Musk.","The password protecting the louvre's video surveillance system was simply “louvre. ” french newspaper libération first reported the revelation.

Sulfur Cave spiders thrive in a unique Sulfur-powered ecosystem





In an astonishing discovery, scientists have found what is believed to be the world’s largest spiderweb inside Sulfur Cave, a dark and narrow passage located on the border between Greece and Albania. This extraordinary web, sprawling over a massive 106 square meters (1,140 square feet), is home to an estimated 111,000 spiders living together in an unprecedented colonial network.The web, first discovered by cavers from the Czech Speleological Society during a 2022 expedition in Vromoner Canyon, is a remarkable patchwork of thousands of individual funnel-shaped webs clinging to the cave walls. A team of researchers led by István Urák from the Sapientia Hungarian University of Transylvania in Romania visited the cave in 2024 to study this extraordinary arachnid colony.The colony comprises two dominant species: about 69,000 individuals of Tegenaria domestica, commonly known as the barn funnel weaver or domestic house spider, alongside more than 42,000 Prinerigone vagans, a type of sheet weaver spider. This is the first documented instance of these two common species exhibiting cooperative colonial behavior instead of their usual solitary or predatory interactions.According to the researchers, the absence of light within Sulfur Cave appears to have altered normal spider behaviors, potentially disrupting predatory instincts and allowing these species to coexist in such high densities.The cave environment is uniquely sustained by a sulfur-rich stream flowing through the cavern, producing hydrogen sulfide that supports a sulfur-based microbial biofilm ecosystem.The spiders’ primary diet consists of non-biting midges, which feed on these microbial films, creating a fascinating sulfur-driven food web that sustains the massive spider colony. This cave ecosystem is unlike any other, as molecular and gut content analyses reveal that the cave-dwelling spiders have genetically diverged from their surface relatives and possess less diverse microbiomes due to their sulphur-based diet.The cave is also a hotspot for reproduction, with female house spiders known to lay six to eight egg sacs every 20 to 25 days, each containing up to 100 eggs in the first cocoon, followed by smaller successive clutches. The density of the webs makes it impossible to count all the egg sacs precisely.“The moment of discovery inspired admiration, respect, and gratitude,” said lead author Urák, emphasizing the uniqueness and ecological importance of this find. The research team is now preparing for further studies to better understand the web’s ecology and the adaptations of its arachnid inhabitants. Conservation of this site remains a priority, given its fragile and isolated nature.This groundbreaking discovery sheds light on how species adapt within extreme environments and reveals a hidden biodiversity hotspot demonstrating remarkable biological cooperation and survival.","Scientists have found what is believed to be the world’s largest spiderweb inside sulfur cave, a dark and narrow passage located on the border between greece and albania.

Reconstructing the streets of ancient Makkah





Witnessing the birth of a community





Madina and the principles of early islam





An educational and emotional experience









Visitors to the Sharjah International Book Fair are now able to experience the heart of early Islam as never before. A new virtual reality (VR) installation, developed by Ana Al Madina, transports participants more than 1,400 years back in time, offering an immersive encounter with the streets, homes, and spiritual landmarks of Makkah and Madina. The experience blends meticulous historical reconstruction with advanced VR technology, allowing users to witness the life, culture, and transformative events of the Prophet Muhammad’s era in vivid, almost tangible detail.The VR journey begins in the very heart of pre-Islamic Makkah, the city of the Prophet’s birth. Participants descend through space before landing in a bustling metropolis, where narrow alleys and open markets unfold around them. Rough stones form the Kaaba, surrounded by the idols that once stood there. Traders sell goods, residents move through crowded streets, and the narration provides insight into daily life, including social norms and the position of women and young girls prior to Islam.The simulation then leads viewers through the early life of the Prophet Muhammad (peace be upon him). Key moments include his spiritual retreat in the Cave of Hira, where Angel Jibreel revealed the first message of Islam.The visual and auditory elements are designed to create an overwhelming sense of presence, with visitors often instinctively reaching toward the cave walls as if to confirm the reality of the experience.Dr Adil Abdul Qadir, Manager of Ana Al Madina, explained the intent behind the project: “This VR set is designed purely for educational purposes. People who experience it understand what Makkah and Madina were like 1,400 years ago—the culture, the lifestyle, and the way people interacted.”The simulation continues by showing the early Muslim armies forming in Makkah, followed by the city’s transformation after the spread of Islam. These sequences provide both historical context and emotional resonance, culminating in the transition to the modern-day Kaaba. At this stage, users can virtually step inside the Holy Kaaba itself, observing its structure, golden lamps, and the serenity that defines the sacred space. For many, the experience is profoundly moving.“The feeling of watching or experiencing this is amazing,” Dr Adil said. “Many people come out with tears in their eyes because it feels so real, as if they have truly travelled back in time. It helps them understand the message of peace and unity that the Prophet brought.”The VR journey then transports participants to Madina, highlighting the Prophet’s migration and the construction of Masjid Al Nabawi. Users catch glimpses of his home, community life, and the societal structures he established. The simulation emphasises the core values of early Islamic society: compassion, equality, and justice. Every visual and narrative element is designed to reinforce how these principles shaped both the community and the broader trajectory of Islam.Dr Adil summarised the broader purpose of the project: “This remarkable journey connects people to faith through deep knowledge. We want visitors not just to see history, but to truly feel it, to experience the timeless values that shaped our world.”The Ana Al Madina VR experience represents more than a technological marvel; it is an educational tool and a spiritual bridge. By combining historical accuracy with immersive storytelling, it allows users to engage with the earliest days of Islam in a way that is both intellectually enlightening and emotionally resonant. Visitors leave with a deeper understanding of Makkah and Madina’s heritage, the life of the Prophet, and the enduring values he imparted.","At sharjah book fair, visitors wearing vr headsets explore ancient makkah streets and the holy kaaba.
