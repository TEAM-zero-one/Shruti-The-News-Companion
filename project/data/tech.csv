AI Rivals Altman, Amodei Snub Each Other, Turns India AI Impact Summit Photo Op With PM Modi Awkward

NEW DELHI: At the AI Impact Summit on Thursday, there was a ""caught-off-guard moment"" on stage. When PM Narendra Modi invited tech leaders to join him on the dais for a group photo, Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei and OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, who ended up standing next to each other, stopped short of holding hands.Instead, the two AI rivals stood beside each other with arms crossed - a subtle but noticeable gesture that stood out during the otherwise celebratory moment.The moment when Altman and Amodei chose not to join hands on stage quickly went viral across social media platforms. The optics drew attention at a time when rivalry between OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, and Anthropic, which develops Claude, sharpened. Both companies aggressively competed to position their models as the preferred AI assistant for users globally, intensifying an already high stakes battle for global dominance.Altman later clarified in a media statement, ""I was sort of confused... (PM) Modi grabbed my hand and put it up, and I just wasn't sure what we were supposed to be doing.""While CEOs of other companies joined hands, Amodei and Altman stood uneasily, their elbows touching.Altman and Amodei worked together at OpenAI till 2019. Amodei, his sister, Daniela and a group of researchers, left the company in 2020 due to disagreements with Altman and the board over the company's direction, and subsequently set up Anthropic.Earlier this month, Altman hit out at Anthropic after the latter used a Super Bowl campaign to criticise a potential introduction of advertising within ChatGPT. The ads characterised such a move as a ""betrayal"". The TV ads positioned its own Claude chatbot as permanently ad-free.Altman called this campaign ""dishonest"" and defended his company's strategy of using ads, being different from what Anthropic portrayed. ""We are not stupid and know our users would reject that... I guess it's on brand for Anthropic doublespeak to use a deceptive ad to critique theoretical deceptive ads that aren't real, but a Super Bowl ad is not where I would expect it,"" he had said in a social media post.","Openai ceo sam altman and anthropic ceo dario amodei did not hold hands.

NEW DELHI: Anthropic has raised concerns about development of fully autonomous weapons without a human in the loop and mass surveillance of US citizens, its co-founder and chief executive Dario Amodei said.Speaking to a TV channel on the sidelines of the AI Impact Summit on Thursday, he said these red lines are critical and it is essential to ensure AI is used in a way that is compatible with democracy and aligned with the company's values.He was responding to a question on whether the company could face blacklisting by the US govt because of its restrictions on how the technology is used. ""We continue to have productive discussions and are excited to help countries in national security,"" he said.Addressing the sell-off in IT stocks amid fears around AI models, Amodei said the company is not trying to replace the existing industry but to work with it. He compared Anthropic to Lego blocks, saying other companies build on its models. However, he acknowledged that some disruption is inevitable.Earlier in the day, he said India could see 20-25% economic growth driven by AI-led productivity gains.""It sounds absurd, and is unknown anywhere in the world. But as I think about this, it kind of stacks all the factors for a very bullish picture of how that growth could happen. India has technical capabilities and eagerness to adopt AI...

'India Well Positioned To Lead The World In AI': OpenAI CEO Sam Altman At AI Impact Summit

NEW DELHI: OpenAI CEO Sam Altman placed India squarely at the centre of global AI map, arguing that the world's largest democracy is not merely adopting AI at scale but shaping its trajectory.""More than 100 million people in India use ChatGPT every week,"" he said at the AI Impact Summit on Thursday, adding that ""more than a third of them are students"". India, he noted, is now the fastest-growing market for Codex, OpenAI's coding agent. ""The world's largest democracy is well positioned to lead in AI. Not just to build it, but to shape it and decide what our future is going to look like.""He also noted that it is becoming increasingly more affordable for countries in the Global South to use AI. The cost of OpenAI's models, he said, had come down by more than 1000x in 14 months, adding costs would continue to reduce dramatically in the coming times. High AI infrastructure costs make it difficult particularly for smaller companies and startups to generate returns on investment quickly.Altman said AI models in past few months had become so powerful that they are even discovering new knowledge. ""There was a recent physics result that really seemed to amaze a lot of physicists,"" he said.Altman's most arresting claim was that humanity may be only a couple of years away from early versions of true super-intelligence. If that proves correct, he said, ""by the end of 2028, more of the world's intellectual capacity could reside inside of data centres than outside of them"". He conceded he could be wrong, but noted that it was an issue that bears serious consideration. A super-intelligent system, he suggested, could one day do ""a better job being the CEO of a major company than any executive"" or outperform the best scientists in research.However, he cautioned increasingly capable systems can be misused, noting in particular open-source bio models can be misused to create dangerous new pathogens.He acknowledged concerns about concentration of AI in the hands of select companies and countries. The only path forward, he said, is to have democratised AI and put these tools in hands of people, even if it comes with some downsides. ""All of my study of history suggests that concentrating AI power in the hands of one company or country, even if it was in the name of safety, would be a disastrously bad thing to do,"" he said.Asked about fair compensation for traditional new media, Altman cited the US fair use principle to defend their use. ""Our stance is that when we're displaying a quote from a news article or an opinion piece or something like that, we want to do that in a way where we can explore new business models with creators for training.""","'india well positioned to lead the world in ai': openai ceo sam altman.

AI Impact Summit: Facing Backlash Over China-made Robo Dog, Galgotias University Told To Leave Event

University issues clarification

NEW DELHI: Galgotias University was asked to vacate its stall at the AI Summit Expo in Bharat Mandapam on Wednesday after a robotic dog displayed at its booth as an in-house innovation was identified as a commercially available Chinese product, said government sources.The robot, showcased by the university as “Orion,” was recognised by observers as the Unitree Go2 made by Chinese robotics firm Unitree. The incident quickly escalated into a wider controversy at the India AI Impact Summit 2026 , a flagship AI event inaugurated by PM Modi.The robotic dog displayed at the university’s stall was identified as the Unitree Go2, a commercially available quadruped robot sold in India for about Rs 2–3 lakh.Critics said the robot was presented at the summit as a product developed by the university, raising questions about showcasing imported technology at a national AI event meant to highlight domestic innovation.After scrutiny intensified, power at the Galgotias University pavilion at the AI Summit was also reportedly cut off after it was asked to vacate the expo.Professor Neha Singh, while presenting the robot earlier, told DD News, ""We are the first private university investing more than 350 crore rupees in artificial intelligence and we have a dedicated data science and artificial intelligence block on the campus. So Orion has been developed by the Center of Excellences and as you can see, it can take all shapes and sizes.”“It's quite naughty also. It's quite naughty also and it can perform small tasks of surveillance, monitoring,” she added.The controversy drew sharp reactions from opposition. The Congress said on X: “The Modi government has made a laughing stock of India globally, with regard to AI. In the ongoing AI summit, Chinese robots are being displayed as our own. The Chinese media has mocked us. This is truly embarrassing for India. What is even more shameful is the fact that Modi’s minister Ashwini Vaishnaw is indulging in the same falsehood, promoting China's robots at the Indian summit. """"The Modi Government has caused irreparable damage to the image of the country - they have reduced AI to a joke - a field in which we could be world leaders given our data power,"" it added.Leader of opposition in Lok Sabha Rahul Gandhi called the summit a “disorganised PR spectacle.” In a post on X, he said, “Instead of leveraging India's talent and data, the AI summit is a disorganised PR spectacle - Indian data up for sale, Chinese products showcased.”In the first statement, Galgotias University said it had not built or claimed to have built the robotic dog and emphasised its focus on student learning through exposure to advanced global technologies.""Let us be clear - Galgotias has not built this robodog,neither have we claimed. But what we are building are minds that will soon design, engineer, and manufacture such technologies right here in Bharat. Innovation knows no borders. Learning should not either. We will continue to source the best technologies from across the world so our students can study them, challenge them, improve upon them—and ultimately create world-class solutions from India for the world. ""In a later statement, the university said concerns about “propaganda” against the university were misplaced.“We at Galgotias, faculty and students, are deeply pained by the propaganda campaign against our university. We would like to clearly state that the robotic programming is part of our endeavour to make students learn Al programming and develop & deploy real world skills using globally available tools and resources, given developing Al talent is need of an hour.”Professor Neha Singh, who was representing the university, said the controversy stemmed from unclear communication.“The controversy happened because things may not have been expressed clearly. I take accountability that perhaps I did not communicate it properly, as it was done with a lot of energy and enthusiasm and very quickly, so I may not have come across as eloquently as I usually do. Also, the intent may not have been properly understood. One important point is regarding the robot dog—we cannot claim that we manufactured it. I have told everyone that we introduced it to our students to inspire them to create something better on their own. Our university contributes to building future leaders by providing cutting-edge technologies in the field of AI, and it will continue to do so.”The summit’s focus on India’s AI ambitions was overshadowed after observers identified the robot as the Unitree Go2, a model sold by Chinese robotics company Unitree.","The robot, showcased by the university as “orion,” was recognised by observers as the unitree go2 made by chinese robotics firm unitree.

2. Rolls-Royce Cullinan (Mansory Edition)

3. Ferrari F8 Tributo



4. Lamborghini Urus (Neon Yellow)

5. Lamborghini Gallardo

For the 24-year-old LaMelo Ball, the driveway usually looks a little different than the average commuter's, especially with a $260 million contract. The Charlotte Hornets sensation’s car collection is more than just a fleet of expensive metal, it is an extension of his 1-of-1 brand.Valued at over $1.2 million, the NBA All-Star’s garage is a mix of high-speed Italian engineering and heavy-duty American muscle, almost always finished with a custom flair that ensures he’s never missed on the streets of Uptown Charlotte. So, let’s take a look at these top five standout vehicles in LaMelo’s world-class collection.Perhaps his most famous (and recently infamous) ride is the custom-wrapped GMC Hummer EV. This electric beast was designed as a rolling tribute to his signature Puma MB.01 sneakers. The car features a desert camo 3M wrap with bright orange accents on the rims, with graphics inspired by tattoos, and a glass display case inside for his shoes. While the vehicle made headlines in February 2026 after a minor collision in downtown Charlotte, it remains the ultimate symbol of LaMelo Ball’s multi-million dollar partnership with Puma.For pure luxury, LaMelo turns to his blacked-out Rolls-Royce Cullinan. This isn't just a standard luxury SUV but a heavily modified moving symbol of opulence by Mansory. Ball is known for frequently changing the look of this car, and this car too has changed from matte black to deep purple and, most recently, to a bold dark lava orange. It features a 6.7L twin-turbo V12 under the hood, showcasing the perfect combination of a smooth ride and aggressive street presence.When it’s time for pure speed, LaMelo Ball knows it’s time to drive the Ferrari F8 Tributo. The car can hit 211 mph and sprints from 0 to 60 in under three seconds. The F8 Tributo is a masterpiece of aerodynamics. LaMelo has famously had the car outfitted with a hologram skin that shifts colors depending on the angle of the light, making it one of the most eye-catching Ferraris in the league.LaMelo’s Neon Yellow Lamborghini Urus is impossible to ignore, as the car features a Hexus fluorescent wrap, a 1016 Industries widebody kit, and massive 24-inch wheels. This 641-horsepower SUV with 4.0 liter and V8 engine is his daily driver for making a statement. Ball has included other personal touches like the custom red “RARE” calipers and bright orange interior.This car holds a special place in LaMelo Ball’s collection as it was a gift from his father, LaVar Ball, for his 16th birthday. The car is reported to be valued at $185,000, and it’s one of the older models in his garage. With a classic V10-powered Gallardo, the car is customised from blue to a neon colour to create a “not from here” style for the budding NBA star.",Charlotte hornets star lamelo ball has a $260 million contract with the nba.

Passports and other identity documents belonging to hundreds of Abu Dhabi Finance Week (ADFW) attendees have been posted online. High-profile attendees of the December 2025 event from the cryptocurrency, international finance, and political sectors had their personal information compromised in the security breach. Over 35,000 people attended the event.According to documents reviewed by the Financial Times (FT), scans of more than 700 passports and state identity cards were found on an unprotected cloud storage server linked to the state-sponsored investment conference. This includes data of former British Prime Minister Lord David Cameron, billionaire hedge fund manager Alan Howard, and former White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci.Other prominent individuals whose details were disclosed included Richard Teng, co-chief executive of crypto exchange Binance and former chief of ADGM, and Lucie Berger, the EU's ambassador to the UAE, the FT reports, citing a sample of files reviewed.Roni Suchowski, a freelance security researcher and consultant, identified the issue and said that the exposed data could be accessed by anyone using a standard web browser.After the FT contacted ADFW about the data exposure this week, the server was secured. Cybersecurity experts said the lapse could harm the Gulf state's reputation, which frequently hosts international conferences and emphasises its security arrangements.Suchowski identified the data exposure using commonly available software that scans cloud services for unsecured information. He said the dataset, which included tens of thousands of publicly accessible files, such as passports, ID cards, and ADFW invoices, was likely exposed for at least two months. He added that earlier attempts to alert ADFW had been unsuccessful, which prompted him to contact the FT.in cases of data breaches to protect affected individuals, Suchowski told the publication.the researcher added.Complete passport scans can be valuable to fraudsters operating on the dark web. These documents can be combined with other personal information to facilitate identity theft , targeted phishing attempts, or unauthorised access to online accounts.In a statement to FT, ADFW confirmedNeil Quilliam, an associate fellow at Chatham House’s Middle East and North Africa Programme, described the ADFW cyber security incident as aHe said such aADFW said it had contacted the affected attendees to inform them about the data breach.

What Sarvam AI has demonstrated - world class AI can be done much more affordably and sustainably with much lower energy and compute footprint - is important.

I have come to believe that in software code generation, much more energy and compute efficient approaches to AI can be developed.

That is important because the earth cannot afford today's AI energy footprint.

Sridhar Vembu has said that artificial intelligence (AI) can be developed in a more affordable and sustainable way, with far lower energy and computing needs than what is commonly used today. In a post shared on X (formerly known as Twitter), Vembu pointed to the work done by Sarvam AI as an example of how high-quality AI systems can be built without heavy reliance on large-scale infrastructure. For those unaware, Sarvam AI is an AI model founded by IIT alumni – Pratyush Kumar and Vivek Raghavan. The Bengaluru-based startup recently claimed that the AI model has outperformed some of the biggest names in artificial intelligence, including Google Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.In the post, Vembu said Sarvam AI’s work shows that “world-class AI” does not require excessive compute power or energy consumption. He added that this approach is important as concerns grow over the environmental impact of large AI models, which rely on energy-intensive data centres.The Zoho founder also said he believes software code generation, in particular, offers scope for more efficient AI techniques. According to Vembu, new approaches could significantly reduce the energy and compute footprint needed to build and run such systems.Sridhar Vembu further warned that the current trajectory of AI development may not be sustainable in the long run. Vembu said the planet cannot support the rising energy demands of today’s AI models, highlighting the need for alternatives that balance performance with environmental responsibility.His comments come amid broader global debate over the cost, scalability, and environmental impact of advanced AI systems, as companies continue to invest heavily in computing infrastructure to train and deploy large models.","Sridhar vembu said sarvam ai's work shows that ‘world-class ai’ does not require excessive compute power or energy consumption.

Instagram’s beauty filters and free expression



Underage users and enforcement



Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has testified in Los Angeles Superior Court on Wednesday (February 18). According to a report by CNBC, Zuckerberg informed that court that he had reached out to Apple CEO Tim Cook in 2018 to discuss the ‘well being of teens and kids’. The comments from Meta CEO came after the defense lawyers presented emails between the two executives, aiming to highlight that Zuckerberg was proactive about the safety of kids and teens on Instagram . “I care about the wellbeing of teens and kids who are using our services,” Zuckerberg said.The central issue in the trial is whether Instagram’s beauty filters harmed young users. Lawyers pressed Zuckerberg on internal discussions about banning cosmetic surgery filters after experts warned that these filters will have negative impact of the teenage girls. The report adds that Zuckernger acknowledged the concerns but mentioned that the decision came down to free expression. “I genuinely want to err on the side of giving people the ability to express themselves,” he testified.Along with this, the case also centers on the allegations that Meta designed Instagram to maximise the time spent on the app. However, Zuckerberg pushed back, saying that the engagement metrics were used as internal milestones rather than company goals.The evidence presented in the court included documents from Instagram chief Adam Mosseri, showing targets to increase daily user time to 40 minutes in 2023 and 46 minutes in 2026.The lawyers also questioned whether Meta adequately prevents under-13 users from joining Instagram. As the documents presented before the court revealed that nearly 4 million children under the age of 13 are using the platform in the US. Replying to the question, Meta CEO admitted that some users lie about their age but he also said that Meta removes underage accounts when identified and Instagram only began requiring birthdays at sign‑up in late 2019.The trial also saw unusual moments, with Judge Carolyn B. Kuhl warning that anyone using AI smart glasses during testimony would be held in contempt. Members of Zuckerberg’s team were photographed wearing Meta’s Ray‑Ban AI glasses before entering the courthouse.The Los Angeles case is one of several lawsuits this year accusing social media companies of harming young users’ mental health.

Satellite radar study claims vast underground structures beneath the Giza Pyramid,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/satellite-radar-study-claims-vast-underground-structures-beneath-the-giza-pyramid/articleshow/128546086.cms,"Satellite radar study claims vast underground structures beneath the Giza Pyramid



Synthetic aperture radar used to map subsurface features beneath the Pyramid of Khafre



Claims generate online interest and academic caution



Natural caves already exist beneath the Giza Plateau



Speculation links findings to ancient myths and older cultures





Reports emerging in March 2025 have drawn attention to fresh claims about hidden structures beneath the Pyramid of Khafre on the Giza plateau. An Italy-based research group, working with satellite radar imagery rather than ground excavation, says it has identified large underground features extending deep below the monument. The team used Synthetic Aperture Radar data gathered from orbiting satellites and processed it to produce composite images of subsurface density. Their interpretation points to vertical shafts and sizable chambers cut into the bedrock. The findings have not been verified through an on-site investigation. For now, they remain part of an ongoing debate about remote sensing methods, data interpretation and the long-studied geology of the Giza plateau in Egypt.The researchers relied on Synthetic Aperture Radar, often shortened to SAR. This technology sends radar signals from satellites in orbit. The signals reflect off the ground and are recorded, then processed using mathematical modelling. Variations in density and structure can appear as patterns in the final images.Based on this study, “What Really Lies Beneath the Pyramids?” , the team believes it can see eight deep cylindrical shafts beneath the pyramid.These are said to descend hundreds of metres into the limestone bedrock. At the lower end, the images appear to show two large cubic chambers. Inside the pyramid itself, five vertical voids are also suggested. It is an interpretation of patterns rather than a physical survey.The announcement moved quickly across social media platforms. Alternative history commentators gave it prominence. Videos and commentary circulated widely within days.Academic reaction has been more restrained. Egyptologists point out that satellite radar imagery can be complex. Image processing may produce shapes that resemble structures without confirming their material nature. Without drilling, excavation or ground-penetrating surveys, it is difficult to establish what lies below.The Giza plateau is not solid stone throughout. Limestone bedrock in the area contains natural cavities and fissures. Some caves have been explored in previous decades. Earlier geophysical surveys also detected voids in certain areas beneath the pyramids.Because of this, some researchers suggest the radar signatures could represent natural formations rather than engineered shafts. The difference matters. Geological voids are common in limestone terrain. The present claims do not yet clearly separate between natural and artificial origins.Beyond the technical debate, some writers have drawn connections between the proposed structures and ancient Egyptian ideas of the Duat, the underworld realm described in funerary texts. Others go further, suggesting links with prehistoric sites in Anatolia associated with the Taş Tepeler tradition.These associations remain speculative. No archaeological evidence currently connects the Giza plateau to those earlier cultures. For now, the radar study adds another layer to the discussion around Khafre’s pyramid. It does not settle it.","Satellite radar study claims vast underground structures beneath the giza pyramid.claims generate online interest and academic caution.speculation links findings to ancient myths and older cultures.

Jimmy Donaldson responds after X users question his eyes as MrBeast shares vision struggle and 1 billion monthly viewers claim





Jimmy Donaldson, known to millions as MrBeast, has spoken openly about his eyesight after people on X said his “eyes never smile.” The YouTube star, who runs the most followed individual channel on the platform, replied directly to the comment and shared something personal. He said he is “borderline blind in my right eye” and that he has to squint to see properly, even when he wears contact lenses. The comment started when an X user, @IterIntellectus, said his eyes looked “off.” Instead of ignoring it, Jimmy Donaldson answered himself.He wrote, “I love how the biggest criticism of me is about my eyes which are out of my control. I’m borderline blind in my right eye, the reason they look off is because I have to squint my right eye to see better even with my contacts in. There is nothing I can do.”His reply quickly spread across social media. Many people supported him. Others continued to question his expressions. But the main point was clear. He said his eye condition is not something he can fix.After Jimmy Donaldson explained his vision issue, the same user answered, “well, i haven’t seen any of your videos so i can’t really comment on them. but if its a vision thing then fair enough, sorry you’re blind man, that sucks.”That reply also gained attention.Soon, more users joined the conversation. One account, @GrowSoulNow, wrote, “People will literally find a way to villainize a man for the way his eyes focus while he’s busy curing blindness for thousands.” Another user, @AceDailyX, said, “people will always attack what they can see instead of what actually matters… the fact you’re still showing up and explaining it takes more strength than they’ll ever admit, why do we act like someone’s face is public property. ”Still, not everyone agreed. One person, @sorisshin, wrote, “The only images I’ve ever seen of you genuinely smiling have been AI. The ‘critique’ isn’t that your eyes look weird. It’s that your entire demeanor doesn’t seem at all genuine or happy.”This all began after @Pubity shared a post saying MrBeast gets around 1 billion unique monthly viewers, which would mean about one out of every eight people on Earth watches him. As of January 2026, according to Viewstats, the analytics platform co-founded by Jimmy Donaldson, his channel recorded more than three billion views in that month alone. The platform also shows his channel has crossed 112 billion total views overall.Even with huge numbers and global fame, Jimmy Donaldson made it clear that some things, like his eyesight, are simply beyond his control.","Youtube star jimmy donaldson, known as mrbeast, has spoken openly about his eyesight.
