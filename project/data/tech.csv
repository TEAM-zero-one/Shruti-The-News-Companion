NEW DELHI: Cracking down on deepfakes, the Centre has tightened India's digital rules by mandating compulsory labelling, traceability and user declarations for AI-generated content. It has also sharply cut timelines to take down unlawful content to as little as three hours from 36 hours and placed direct compliance responsibility on social media platforms and their senior officers.For the first time, AI-generated material, including deepfake videos, synthetic audio and manipulated visuals, has been brought under a formal regulatory framework through amendments to the IT intermediary rules. The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Amendment Rules, 2026 will come into force from Feb 20.The amended rules introduce a statutory definition of ""synthetically generated information"" (SGI).The new rules impose mandatory obligations on intermediaries to identify, label and trace AI content. All AI-generated or AI-altered material must carry a clear and prominent disclosure visible to users.Platforms must also embed persistent metadata and unique identifiers to enable traceability of the content’s origin and the tools used to create it. Once applied, these disclosures cannot be altered, hidden or removed.The rules exclude routine edits such as colour correction, noise reduction, compression or translation, as long as they do not change the meaning. Clearly hypothetical or illustrative drafts are exempt.Large social media platforms face stricter compliance requirements. Before any content goes live, platforms must ensure users declare if it is AI-generated. Intermediaries must deploy automated tools to verify these declarations by analysing the content’s format, source and characteristics. If content is identified as synthetic, visible labelling becomes mandatory. Platforms that knowingly allow unlabelled AI-generated content to remain online will be treated as having failed their due-diligence obligations.The rules also compress response timelines. Certain lawful takedown orders must now be complied with within three hours, compared to 36 hours earlier. Other deadlines have been tightened, with a 15-day window reduced to 7 days and a 24-hour window cut to 12 hours. Platforms must acknowledge user grievances within two hours and resolve them within seven days.Oversight and enforcement will rest with the ministry of electronics and information technology, while users can appeal platform decisions to the grievance appellate committee.Misuse of SGI linked to child sexual abuse material, obscene content, false electronic records, impersonation using a real person’s identity or voice, or explosives-related material will attract action under multiple criminal laws.Platforms must also warn users at least once every three months about penalties for misuse of AI-generated content.","The centre has tightened india's digital rules by mandating labelling, traceability and user declarations for ai-generated content.

In the next phase, the focus will be on greater use of biofuels through flex-fuel vehicles (FFVs), higher Bio-CNG blending and hybrid FFV models, while electric vehicle adoption continues to rise. The final phase is a full shift to zero-emission vehicles.Niti Aayog said road transport depended heavily on fossil fuels, with petrol and diesel accounting for more than 80% of energy consumption.

Ten days of love: Times Prime's February celebration everyone's talking about,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ten-days-of-love-times-primes-february-celebration-everyones-talking-about/articleshow/128167796.cms,"February has always been a month of celebration, but this year, it's lasting longer than ever. Times Prime's Love All Members Fest is back for its second edition, running February 6-15, and it's bringing something the season has been missing: ten straight days of joy, surprises, and reasons to celebrate love in every form it takes.Imagine waking up each morning knowing that at noon, something delightful is waiting for you. That's the magic of Love All Members Fest. For ten consecutive days, the Times Prime app unlocks a brand-new exclusive offer—and the anticipation has become a daily ritual for members across India.Last year's fest was a revelation. Members set noon reminders, shared their favorite finds with friends, and made spontaneous plans around the offers. This year, the celebration has grown even bigger — experiences in four cities, and a lineup that truly reflects how beautifully diverse celebration can be.February 6 opens with a golden rose from IGP—perfect whether you send it to someone special or keep it for yourself. February 7 brings Rs 1,000 off travel bookings through Klook. GIVA offers Rs 1,000 off jewelry on February 8, while FlowerAura follows with 25% off on February 9.Members also get 60% off soft toys from FirstCry on February 10, and movie lovers can grab Rs 500 off Cinepolis tickets on February 11.The beauty days arrive next: complimentary full-sized perfume from OG Beauty on February 12, and Renee's Lip Drip Glossy Balm on February 13—both free with just shipping costs. February 14 brings the most indulgent offer: 100% cashback on services at Enrich Beauty. The fest closes on February 15 with Sbooch's Kombucha set, a refreshing wellness-focused note to end the celebration.What makes this year's fest truly special is how it extends beyond your phone screen. Times Prime is bringing members together through the Wine Affair activation—featuring Sangria-making workshops at Café Noir and wine-tasting sessions at Refuge.These aren't just perks; they're experiences worth making time for. There's something uniquely wonderful about learning to craft the perfect Sangria with fellow members or discovering new wine notes in good company.For anyone navigating February solo or simply wanting to meet new people, the Singles Meets happening across Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Kolkata, and Hyderabad offer genuine connection without pressure. Last year's Mumbai gathering filled up in 48 hours, and participants left with friendships that lasted well beyond February.There's a reason Love All Members Fest resonated so deeply in its first year. In a season that can sometimes feel prescriptive about who should celebrate and how, this fest simply opens the doors wider.Couples absolutely celebrate—but so do friends planning group outings, parents treating their kids, colleagues surprising each other, and individuals choosing to invest in themselves. The beauty is in the choice. Every day brings something new, and you take what speaks to you.""What I loved most was the lack of pressure,"" shares Anjali Verma, a Delhi-based member who participated last year. ""Some days I claimed offers for myself, some days I surprised my sister. It felt personal, not prescribed.""This approach mirrors how Indians naturally celebrate. Just as Diwali festivities stretch across days or Navratri unfolds over nine nights, February becomes a season rather than a single date. There's room to participate when it suits you, in ways that feel meaningful to your life.The fest's growth speaks volumes. From experiences in two cities to four. And membership signups double during fest periods compared to regular months.Last year saw a 67% spike in daily app engagement, with 58% of participants purchasing for themselves or for non-romantic relationships. Social media fills with members sharing their daily finds and coordinating around experiences.Beyond the individual offers, there's something compelling about the cumulative experience. Ten days of checking in. Ten days of pleasant surprises. Ten days of feeling valued.The daily unlock creates a sense of occasion. Noon becomes a moment. Opening the app feels less like a transaction and more like unwrapping a gift chosen just for you. And because each offer is live for just that day, there's genuine excitement to being part of something happening right now.Throughout the fest, members also access ""hero deals""—gift hampers, gadgets, wallet offers, and a free two-month Crunchyroll subscription. It's a thoughtfully curated celebration that recognizes how diverse the Times Prime community is.For Times Prime members, participating is simple: open the app at 12 PM daily from February 6-15 and discover what's unlocked. For experiences like wine workshops and Singles Meets, book early—the best moments fill up fast.At its heart, Love All Members Fest is about something beautifully simple: celebrating love without boundaries. Love for partners, parents, friends, yourself. Love expressed through a thoughtful gift, a shared experience, a moment of self-care, or just something that makes you smile.This February, Times Prime is proving that celebration doesn't need to fit a single mold. It can be as diverse, vibrant, and personal as the people doing the celebrating. Ten days. Countless ways to participate. One joyful, inclusive season that reminds us all: everyone deserves to feel celebrated.","Times prime's love all members fest is back for its second edition, running february 6-15.

What Fragrances Will Define Ramadan 2026 for Women? Exploring Arabic Perfume Trends

Why Arabic perfume culture is resonating with women ahead of Ramadan 2026







As the holy month of Ramadan gears up to unfold across the Middle East and beyond, women’s fragrance choices are becoming a meaningful expression of personal style, cultural resonance and sensory storytelling. Arabic perfumes, long celebrated for their rich, evocative compositions, are trending this season not just as gifts or evening scents but as symbolic extensions of the Ramadan experience: warm, comforting and deeply memorable.In 2026, the narrative around women’s fragrances reflects broader industry shifts toward textural sophistication and emotional connection. Global perfumery trends emphasise personalisation, immersive scent experiences and nuanced reinterpretations of classic notes, all of which align beautifully with the rich palette of Arabic perfumery.One of the defining movements in the Ramadan perfume landscape this year is the resurgence of floral-oriental compositions. These perfumes blend soft blossoms like jasmine and rose with deeper bases such as amber and musk, resulting in scents that feel both romantic and sophisticated. For many women, these fragrances strike the perfect balance between everyday elegance and evening allure, suitable for mosque visits, iftar gatherings or Eid celebrations.Floral-oriental profiles are evolving in 2026 to feel more refined and textured. Industry voices note that florals are being paired with unexpected elements of earthier woods, nuanced resins or gourmand undertones, giving traditional blooms a modern and personal expression.As the sun sets and social rhythms begin, many women are drawn toward warm spice and amber compositions. These fragrances open with rich, comforting top notes, often complemented by subtle hints of spice, before settling into amber-clad bases that envelop the wearer in warmth. These profiles are especially beloved for evening wear, when gatherings with loved ones call for something both bold and memorable.In a broader context, amber and spice-driven perfumes resonate with a growing preference for scents that feel like a sensory hug: enveloping, rich and long-lasting. This mirrors global trends where gourmands and amber accords are gaining traction for their comforting, tactile qualities.Another strong current in the Ramadan fragrance story for women is the rise of softly sweet and powdery scents. These are lighter, more approachable compositions featuring gentle sweetness or subtle vanilla-like nuances layered with musky or floral undertones.They are excellent for daytime moments of quiet reflection, casual outings or workplaces where subtlety and elegance are valued over bold projection. This trend toward nuanced sweetness also reflects a shift in the industry where refined gourmand notes feel less dessert-sweet and more textured, mature and wearable.More women are also embracing the idea of scent layering by combining multiple fragrances or formats (like concentrated oils, sprays or body mists) to create something uniquely personal. This approach echoes a broader 2026 trend toward “scent wardrobes” or narrative fragrance experiences, where a perfume isn’t just a single choice but part of a richer sensory identity.Layering allows for playful contrasts like a soft floral with a warm amber base or a light citrus top with a spice-accented dry-down, offering versatility throughout the varied moments of Ramadan and Eid.Arabic perfumes for women this Ramadan are not just trending because of their notes; they are resonating because they bridge tradition and contemporary expression. Their richness and depth reflect cultural heritage, while their evolving compositions align with global fragrance innovations, from gumptious amber blends to nuanced floral artistry.Whether worn for spiritual reflection, family gatherings or festive evenings, these fragrances are helping redefine how scent plays into holiday rituals, turning each application into a small celebration of identity, memory and beauty.","Ramadan 2026 fragrance trends: arabic perfumes for women, floral-oriental and amber scents.

Mizkif reflects on Maya Higa breakup while discussing JasonTheWeen and Sakura split,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/mizkif-reflects-on-maya-higa-breakup-while-discussing-jasontheween-and-sakura-split/articleshow/128175138.cms,"Image Via Instagram

Mizkif draws parallels between his breakup and JasonTheWeen–Sakura split

“This is a very similar situation to me and Maya. I was the popular one, she came into my circle, and all of her friends became my friends,”

“This is actually going to make Jason’s career grow. People are going to be more invested in his life and what’s next,”

“The person who’s really going to struggle is Sakura. Where do you go from here when all of your friends are his friends?”





Streamer Mizkif highlighted his past relationship in the course of reacting to the breakup between JasonTheWeen and Sakura. Speaking at a Kick stream, Mizkif related that watching their breakup brought back memories of his breakup with the streamer Maya Higa. His remarks were unique because the personal experience was correlated with a current and widely discussed streamer breakup. Fans immediately drew upon the comparison because all parties involved have online audiences and public personal lives.This, however, happened just a day after JasonTheWeen and Sakura revealed that they had parted ways on February 9, 2026. The two, however, made a joint post where they revealed that they had broken up while still maintaining their respect for each other. The breakup evidently did not come as a surprise, as there had been rumors developing online, including the possibility of Jason cheating on his partner, which he vehemently denied while streaming. The breakup is not the first, either, as the two had parted ways in August 2025 before reuniting.While discussing the situation, Mizkif directly compared it to his own past with Maya Higa.he said.He explained that in streaming relationships, one partner is often more established, which can shape how friendships and careers grow during the relationship.Mizkif also shared his thoughts on how the breakup could affect JasonTheWeen and Sakura differently.he said, suggesting that public attention often increases after major personal events. However, he added that Sakura may face a harder path forward.he asked.His words touched on the common phenomenon where, in the world of streaming, the lines between relationships, work, friendships, and online communities sometimes blend. The experience of having gone through a breakup can find a person starting from scratch or feeling isolated in their social and professional life.Ultimately, however, it was Mizkif's reflections that provided a wider overview on the impact of public break-ups, beyond the emotional toll they can take on an individual. Shared fan bases ensure that, even when a relationship comes to an end, it can have a lingering effect on both parties, and it was with this recognition that JasonTheWeen and Sakura are now moving forward, as illustrated with Mizkif's reflections on this all-too-familiar situation within live stream culture.","Jasontheween and sakura revealed that they had broken up on february 9, 2026.

Apple iPhone 17e price (expected)

Apple is reportedly gearing up to announce the successor to last year’s iPhone 16e. Likely to be called iPhone 17e, the smartphone “is due imminently”, claims Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman in the latest edition of his weekly PowerOn newsletter. “Apple will market the 17e heavily to users in emerging economies and enterprises — two areas the company plans to target aggressively this year with both devices and software,” Gurman writes in the newsletter. He also shared that the phone will come with a few “big changes” that include iPhone 17’s A19 chipset and MagSafe charging, among others.The upcoming iPhone 17e, Gurman says will be powered by the A19 chip that comes with iPhone 17. The A19 offers a modest boost in CPU speed compared to the A18, but most of its improvement is in GPU, thus allowing it to be even better for AI features and gaming.Further, the handset is tipped to get MagSafe charging feature. Another change coming the iPhone 17e is that it may be equipped with Apple’s newest in-house cellular and wireless chips.Korean news outlet The Elec previously reported that the iPhone 17e is expected to feature slimmer display bezels while retaining the iPhone 14-era OLED panel. Other major new features include an 18MP front camera with Center Stage. This camera automatically extends to show everybody in a group selfie, even when you hold the phone vertically.As far as the pricing of the upcoming iPhone 17e is concerned, Gurman says that the company is planning to keep pricing the same as iPhone 16e. To recall, iPhone 16e launched in 2025 with a price tag of $599 or Rs 59,900 in India.","Apple is reportedly gearing up to announce the successor to last year’s iphone 16e.

Travis Kelce reportedly never liked hanging out with Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds when Taylor Swift was friends with them

Travis Kelce seems to be worried about Taylor Swift

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce publicly distanced themselves from the pop star’s former best friend, Blake Lively, and her husband, popular Hollywood actor, Ryan Reynolds, ever since their legal drama with Justin Baldoni began.While Taylor Swift could be called to court after her controversial text exchange with Blake Lively was made public, it seems Travis Kelce was never fond of their company.A few hours ago, as per Rob Shuter, a source revealed that, “He hated the double-dating…He felt like it was all optics and no authenticity.”The source added, “Travis is blunt and real…Ryan is curated. That contrast never worked.”Just two months before Taylor Swift was dragged in the legal chaos between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, the pop star and Travis Kelce were spotted on a double date with the Hollywood power couple.That was the last time either Taylor Swift or Travis Kelce were spotted alongside Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds. The two have remained publicly distant from the Hollywood power couple ever since.Around a year ago, there were also strong speculations of Travis Kelce removing Ryan Reynolds from his social media.But neither Travis Kelce nor Ryan Reynolds addressed the speculations in public.While Taylor Swift remains private about her emotions about the situation, it seems Travis Kelce is pretty concerned about her and his future in the league after a pretty poor season on the field.According to The U.S. Sun, a source has said, ""Between a difficult season, the reality of preparing for retirement—which has left him stressed and a bit depressed…”The insider added, “And the looming possibility of Taylor being called to court as a witness, it's been emotionally exhausting and increasingly frustrating for him to handle.""This has also led to many insiders claiming that Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have decided to put their “wedding on hold” until they are able to deal with the issues in their lives.However, both Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce have stayed away from confirming these speculations in public.",Travis kelce reportedly felt awkward and forced during outings with taylor swift’s former friend blake lively and ryan reynolds.

YouTube Music limits free song lyrics to push premium subscriptions





YouTube Music has upset many users after changing how song lyrics work on its app. Earlier, lyrics were free for everyone. Now, free users can only read lyrics for a limited time before they are blocked. This change has prompted dissatisfaction among listeners who love to read song lyrics as they listen. This discontent comes from users’ perception that this move removes a basic feature that assists them in enjoying their favorite music better. The move has also prompted discussion about how much music apps should charge for their features.The update enables free users to view scrollable lyrics for just the first five songs they play. After that limit is reached, the lyrics become blurred and unreadable. To continue seeing lyrics, users must subscribe to YouTube Music Premium, which costs $10.99 per month. The change rolled out widely in early February after being tested with a smaller group of users. A pop-up now appears in the app, showing a countdown of how many free lyric views remain.This move has added to growing criticism of music streaming platforms.While YouTube Music offers free access to songs with ads, many users believe lyrics should remain a basic feature. Lyrics help listeners sing along, learn new languages, and better understand songs. By limiting access, YouTube Music appears to be encouraging users to upgrade to its paid plan rather than improving the free experience.Not all people have the same experience, as some report that they do not usually refer to the lyrics and can get along fine as usual. Some also note that not all songs included in the popular site do have their lyrics available. Despite the various perceptions regarding the change, many regard the change as unnecessary, which according to some, is unfriendly to some of the regular users. This change happens at a time when the service is facing criticism.It is still not clear whether YouTube Music intends to revisit their decision. For now, the limitation on access to lyrics for free users is active. They must weigh their choices between using this service with the limitation and having Premium. Of course, competition between music streaming services can easily depend on their management of basic elements like lyrics.","Youtube music has changed how song lyrics work on its app. Earlier, lyrics were free for everyone.

Rare Mercedes supercar badly damaged in incident

Pre-season plans for Andrea Kimi Antonelli remain unchanged

Formula 1 prospect Andrea Kimi Antonelli was involved in a scary car accident over the weekend when his high-performance Mercedes AMG GT crashed into a roadside barrier close to his home in San Marino. The 19-year-old, seen as one of modern motorsport's preeminent talents, escaped from the crash unscathed. A team spokesperson confirmed that Antonelli was the only person in the car at the time and that no other cars were involved in the accident.Antonelli was just days away from participating in key pre-season testing alongside the Mercedes Formula 1 squad when the accident occurred. Although the incident is dramatic and the luxury supercar has been heavily damaged, preliminary reports suggest that the young Italian will miss no scheduled track sessions. Antonelli then called the authorities to the scene, who have initiated routine investigations into the cause of the crash.The car in the scene, a Mercedes AMG GT 63 PRO 4MATIC+ Motorsport Collectors Edition, is a not-so-regular model that costs about £180,000. The low production numbers of the limited-production supercar and the fact that it is powered by a twin-turbo V8, among other styling cues from Mercedes' Formula 1 program.It ranks among the best performance cars the brand has on sale today.Images from the scene revealed heavy damage to the car's front end and passenger side from where it hit a guardrail. Fortunately, Antonelli appears to have sustained no injury thanks to the modern safety systems and crashworthiness of the vehicle. Emergency services attended but only as a precaution, and the driver did not need any medical treatment, according to reports. Mercedes then issued a brief statement reassuring the safety and well-being of their young driver.It said authorities were investigating road conditions, nearby vehicles, and speed as part of what caused the crash. The current stage carries no implication of driving dangerously, and is considered an unfortunate accident and not a serious offence.Fortunately for Antonelli's Formula 1 preparations, the accident is not set to hinder his plans. Mercedes is still developing their latest challenger, and it is set to link up with teammate George Russell at official pre-season testing in Bahrain. Sources inside the team have indicated that the 19-year-old is in good shape and that his mind is clear and ready to concentrate on his tasks ahead.Antonelli comes into his first full season as a Mercedes race driver after a swift rise through junior categories. He has always been seen as the potential future star and a part of the team for years to come. The crash added a momentary anxiety that was definitely not needed, but it seems to have had no lasting effects.",Andrea kimi antonelli was involved in a car accident over the weekend.

No public EV charging points in GGN, FBD





NEW DELHI: Delhi currently has 8,998 EV charging points against a requirement of 36,177, leaving a shortfall of 27,179, or 302%. Delhi govt has set a target to increase the total number to 16,070 by the end of this year.The situation is similar in neighbouring NCR districts. At present, Gurgaon and Faridabad have no public EV charging points, against requirements of 20 and 26, respectively. Noida has 69 charging points against the required 150 while Greater Noida has only three and needs 13 more.In Ghaziabad, there are 126 public charging points as opposed to the requirement of 450, leading to a gap of 324 points. However, it plans to add 100 such points by Dec 31 this year.According to action plans to deal with air pollution submitted to the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM), Delhi and NCR cities are targeting adding over 7,300 charging points, mostly in Delhi, by the end of this year.Of the total 8,998 EV charging points in Delhi, 8,849 are under the transport department while the remaining 149 are under Delhi Metro Rail Corporation. As per Delhi's action plan, the authorities will almost double the EV charging points to 16,070 this year, but the gap of over 20,000 will remain.Of the 7,000 points planned in Delhi, most are under the transport department. Six points each will be installed at Anand Vihar and New Ashok Nagar RRTS stations, and 66 at stations of Delhi metro.In terms of battery-swapping infrastructure, Delhi has 948 stations against a requirement of 1,606, with a target to scale this up to 1,268 by the end of 2026.Experts said proper EV infrastructure is key for Delhi's clean mobility, but it should be ensured that timelines are adhered to.According to Anumita Roychowdhury, executive director, research and advocacy, Centre for Science and Environment, ""To achieve an ambitious zero-tailpipe-emissions target and improve air quality, the strategy must shift from merely building charging stations to creating a cohesive charging ecosystem. This requires an urgent upscaling of the charging network, dedicated charging hubs and adequate battery-swapping facilities. ""Most critical, she said, will be the implementation of ‘Right to Charge' laws to prevent the obstruction of residents installing chargers in their own parking slots. ""Mandatorily, a substantial part of all parking spaces in new residential and commercial buildings should be EV-ready,"" she added.Amit Bhatt, India managing director, International Council on Clean Transportation, said the requirement for EV charging points is based on vehicle density.""Apart from the addition of public charging points, destination charging (at home or work) should be considered. Most EV charging points were installed when electrification started, and in space which was easily available. However, additional charging points should be added, considering where the demand is, and such points should be surveilled so that they are not vandalised,"" said Bhatt.A CAQM official said the commission will monitor and review the progress of the action plans submitted by Delhi and NCR cities, which have set their own individual targets.","Delhi currently has 8,998 ev charging points against a requirement of 36,177.

Integration of gaming concepts into formal courses using electronic games to illustrate digital literacy, computer science fundamentals, teamwork and creative expression.

Professional pathways including training and qualification programs aligned with Saudi scholarship and vocational tracks like Khadem Al-Haramein Scholarship and Wa’ed, supporting future game designers and developers.

What comes next in Saudi Arabia’s gaming curriculum: Implementation and expansion



Saudi Arabia Rewrites School Rules: Electronic Gaming Is Now Officially ‘Educational’ as KSA Taps Into Global Trend





In a bold and unprecedented move, Saudi Arabia ’s Ministry of Education has officially approved the inclusion of electronic gaming, both competitive and educational aspects, in school curricula across all education levels. This landmark initiative aims to bridge traditional education with 21st-century digital skills, creativity and the rapidly growing gaming industry, reflecting a global shift toward recognising video games as valuable tools for learning and future careers.The decision comes after three strategic memorandums of understanding were signed between the Ministry of Education, the National Institute for Educational Development and the Educational Services Development Company with Savvy Games Group, a state-owned gaming enterprise under the Public Investment Fund. These agreements formalise the integration of electronic games into curricula, development of national gaming competitions and training pathways to build local talent within the gaming sector.Coverage from Al-Marsad newspaper reports that the collaboration will include working with the National Curriculum Center to embed game-related skills and knowledge in school content, alongside initiatives to upskill educators, create educational games and support nationwide innovation challenges tied to the gaming industry.This is one of the most significant educational policy shifts in the Middle East in recent years, not just because games are fun but because they can teach transferable and future-oriented skills. According to international research and global education commentary, competitive video gaming and esports programs in schools can nurture collaboration, strategic thinking, problem-solving, communication and leadership, all skills employers increasingly value.For example, schools in Wales and the US that implemented esports suites and gaming programs noted positive impacts on student engagement, teamwork and pathways into tech-related careers. Just as structured arts or sports programs can support growth, gaming education, when well designed, can be both academic and practical.Saudi Arabia’s move aligns with global experimentation around gaming as an educational tool. In Japan, certain schools have incorporated video games into classroom learning to help students build critical thinking and communication skills, with high participation and positive university progression rates among graduates.Likewise, academic discussion including research into game-based learning curricula such as Quest To Learn in the US, has highlighted how games can reinforce systems thinking and engagement, supporting traditional subjects like math, science and language through interactive design and strategic challenges. Saudi officials are positioning the gaming curriculum initiative as part of a larger push toward digital transformation, innovation and job creation in future industries.The Kingdom’s gaming sector already demonstrates strength, with millions of players and billions in annual revenue, signalling robust interest and economic potential. By formalising gaming education, authorities aim to prepare students for careers across game development, design, esports management, digital media, cybersecurity and related tech sectors. These are the fields that are poised for growth alongside Saudi Arabia’s broader economic diversification goals.While official details on the exact curriculum framework are still emerging, the memorandums outline several key components:The initiative is also expected to include the establishment of gaming labs and innovation hubs within technical and vocational institutions, geared toward hands-on experience and industry projects. Global education voices, including contributors to research platforms and the World Economic Forum , have explored how esports and gaming curricula can teach teamwork, leadership, problem solving and communication skills, especially when embedded within supportive academic structures.These programs often serve dual purposes: they enhance student engagement (particularly among learners who struggle with traditional teaching methods) and they create career pathways in technology, digital arts, programming and business.Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Education is now in the roll-out phase, working with curriculum developers, industry partners and training institutions to finalise content, teacher preparation and infrastructure. The early emphasis will likely be on pilot programs, teacher upskilling and integration phases to ensure the curriculum complements, rather than replaces, existing subject goals.Over time, the success of this gaming integration could attract attention from other countries in the region exploring innovative education models that respond to a rapidly evolving labour market and the rise of digital economies globally. With the official inclusion of electronic gaming in Saudi school curricula, the Kingdom is at the forefront of a global shift toward embracing games as tools for learning, creativity and future career readiness.While challenges remain, including ensuring balanced screen time and aligning gaming with core academic standards, the initiative signals a bold rethinking of how education can evolve to reflect the digital aspirations of a new generation of learners.","Saudi arabia integrates gaming into school curricula: a digital education revolution.

Twitch’s new pause-screen ads draw criticism from viewers and streamers





Twitch is introducing a new kind of advertisement that will appear when the stream is paused. Advertising was one of the main ways for streamers to earn money on Twitch, though it sometimes resulted in a loss for the viewers who missed important parts of the stream. Viewers who want to avoid these interruptions can sign up for Twitch Prime or Turbo; however, not all may afford these services. There have already been complaints over the new kind of advertisement from both the viewers and the streamers themselves who claim that this may adversely affect the streaming service.The new ads will show up whenever someone pauses a stream, even if they step away from the screen. Twitch announced this update on February 10, 2026, saying it is part of an experiment calledThe company also noted that skippable ads are still being tested at the same time. While the goal is to make ads less intrusive, many users have expressed frustration, saying ads while paused could cause viewers to fall behind the live stream or disrupt their viewing habits.Many people have expressed their concerns about the new change through various social media posts. There was even criticism that people may become irritated since pausing a video might be used for quick look-up of information, and the ads might interfere with the pause.Hence, people may stop using the site. The prominent Twitch streamers have also expressed their own concerns that the new ads may interfere with the viewing experience and be detrimental to the streamers.Although there is a backlash, the platform asserts that the test is intended to generate additional earnings for the streamer without totally disrupting the stream. It is said that the ads will only be shown while the stream is paused, thus the streaming will still be conducted at the back of the screen.Ultimately, the new ads that will appear while the viewer has their Twitch video paused serve as a prime example of the constantly ongoing issue of finding the right balance in the name of generating more income without making the user experience suffer as a result. While the streamer derives the intended benefits from such a feature, the viewer base nonetheless has legitimate issues with the overall experience.","The new ads will show up whenever someone pauses a stream, even if they step away from the screen.

GCC's Digital Gold Rush: Are You Skilled Enough for 2026's Tech Takeover?

Soft skills: Leadership, communication and adaptability



Lifelong learning and reskilling mindset



Understanding localisation policies







As GCC economies accelerate towards digital-first, knowledge-driven growth, the skills that employers are looking for in 2026 have shifted dramatically. From Saudi Arabia ’s Vision 2030 projects to the UAE’s AI-led governance push, hiring priorities across the Gulf are increasingly shaped by technology adoption, sustainability goals and workforce localisation policies.Artificial Intelligence sits at the heart of GCC transformation strategies. According to the Hays GCC Salary Guide 2026 , digital and AI-driven roles are among the hardest to fill across the Middle East , with 90% of employers reporting skills shortages, particularly in advanced tech roles.Academic research supports this shift. A 2024 study published on arXiv , analysing millions of job listings, found that AI adoption increases demand not just for AI engineers but for AI-literate professionals across non-technical roles as well. The paper noted, “AI exposure is associated with higher demand for complementary skills such as analytical thinking, adaptability and collaboration.”In the GCC, AI skills are increasingly required in finance, healthcare, government services, logistics and media, not just tech firms.Data has become the backbone of decision-making in Gulf organisations. A landmark 2017 Strategy and PwC report on the GCC digital workforce found that while digital adoption is growing, advanced data skills remain scarce, limiting productivity gains.The report stated, “The shortage of advanced analytics and data science skills is one of the biggest barriers preventing GCC organisations from capturing full value from digital investments.” As governments and enterprises push for smart cities, fintech ecosystems and AI-powered public services, professionals skilled in data analysis, business intelligence and statistical modelling are becoming indispensable.With rapid digitisation comes increased cyber risk. While GCC-specific academic studies are limited, global labour research consistently ranks cybersecurity among the fastest-growing skills worldwide, a trend echoed in GCC hiring data.According to hiring outlooks cited by Khaleej Times and regional recruitment firms, cybersecurity specialists remain in high demand as governments and private firms strengthen digital infrastructureThese skills are especially relevant in banking, government, aviation and healthcare sectors across the GCC.Cloud expertise is now a foundational requirement rather than a niche skill. As per global hiring outlook reports AI, cloud and platform engineering roles dominate new job creation in global capability centres expanding operations linked to GCC markets.Cloud architects, DevOps engineers and platform specialists are especially valuable as Gulf companies migrate operations to scalable digital ecosystems.Despite the digital pivot, engineering and project management remain pillars of GCC employment, driven by infrastructure, energy and urban development megaprojects. According to regional hiring analyses cited by Khaleej Times, demand continues for professionals who can manage large-scale, multi-stakeholder projects, particularly those integrating digital and sustainability elementsProject managers with technical literacy, risk management skills and cross-cultural leadership ability are especially prized.Sustainability is no longer optional in the GCC. With the UAE and Saudi Arabia investing heavily in renewable energy, clean technology and climate initiatives, green skills are moving into the mainstream.A recent 2025 workforce analysis by PeopleConnect Global highlights rising demand for professionals skilled in sustainability reporting, renewable energy systems and environmental compliance across GCC markets.Roles linked to net-zero strategies, ESG compliance and sustainable infrastructure are expected to grow steadily through 2026.Multiple studies stress that human skills grow more valuable as automation increases. The same arXiv 2024 study on AI and labour markets found that AI-exposed roles show higher demand for teamwork, communication and resilience, not less.In the GCC, where teams are highly multicultural, employers increasingly value professionals who can lead diverse teams, communicate clearly and adapt to fast-changing environments.The 2027 Strategy& GCC digital workforce report emphasises that long-term employability depends not on one-time qualifications but on continuous upskilling. The report noted that economies that embed lifelong learning frameworks will be better positioned to meet future labour demands.This message is echoed in national workforce strategies across the Gulf.Understanding Emiratisation, Saudisation and national talent development policies is increasingly important. The Hays GCC Salary Guide 2026 highlights that localisation efforts are reshaping hiring strategies, particularly in leadership and specialist roles. Professionals who align their skills with these frameworks gain a competitive edge.Research across academia, recruitment and policy consistently point to one conclusion that GCC jobs in 2026 will reward hybrid professionals or those who combine digital fluency, analytical capability, adaptability and human-centric skills. From AI literacy to sustainability expertise, the most future-proof careers will belong to individuals who learn continuously, adapt quickly and align with the region’s transformation goals.","Top 2026 skills for gcc job market: ai, data, cybersecurity and more.
