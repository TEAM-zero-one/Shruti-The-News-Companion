DeepSeek has an ‘API request’ for its customers: “…please understand!”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/deepseek-has-an-api-request-for-its-customers-please-understand/articleshow/117987906.cms,"Why DeepSeek is popular

DeepSeek, the Chinese AI startup that recently caused a stir in the tech world, has a request for its customers. The company said that it is experiencing such high demand for its services that it's running out of server capacity. To manage this, they've temporarily restricted access to their application programming interface (API).According to a report by Bloomberg, DeepSeek has temporarily suspended the ability for customers to add more credits to their API accounts to prevent broader service disruptions. This means new users might have to wait to access the API, and existing users will need to manage their usage with their current credit balance.An API allows developers to integrate DeepSeek's AI models into their own applications and services. It’s essentially a way for others to access and utilise DeepSeek's technology.“The existing recharge amount can continue to be used, please understand!” the company said.DeepSeek is reportedly experiencing a surge in demand for its API services. This increased demand is putting a strain on their servers, which are struggling to keep up.DeepSeek’s services have been overwhelmed, likely due to the recent launch of its new models and their competitive pricing. In January, the company unveiled an AI chatbot that it claimed can rival OpenAI’s ChatGPT and was developed at a fraction of the cost of competing products.The company previously restricted signups for new users to people with a mainland China telephone number. DeepSeek also said that discounts for access to its model will end on February 8.Meanwhile, a bunch of countries have already banned the use of the DeepSeek AI model in various capacities. For example, Italy, Australia and Taiwan have banned the use of the chatbot. South Korea has asked government officials to not use DeepSeek chatbot on work devices and India has also warned against using it on official devices.","Deepseek is reportedly experiencing a surge in demand for its api services.

3 Answers Google HR head gave to employees in memo as the company ends diversity hiring goals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/3-answers-google-hr-head-gave-to-employees-in-memo-as-the-company-ends-diversity-hiring-goals/articleshow/118001657.cms,"Read the full memo

With new U.S. Executive Orders, court decisions, and many companies making changes to their DEl programs in recent weeks, we sat down with Fiona Cicconi to learn how Google is thinking about this.
>>>>>>> Stashed changes

Can you tell us how we’re thinking about this across the company?

First, I want to be clear: we’ve always been committed to creating a workplace where we hire the best people wherever we operate, create an environment where everyone can thrive, and treat everyone fairly. That’s exactly what you can expect to see going forward. Our users come from all across the U.S. and around the world, and we serve them better when our employees do, too.

Every year, we review the programs designed to help us get there and make changes. And because we are a federal contractor, our teams are also evaluating changes to our programs required to comply with recent court decisions and U.S. Executive Orders on this topic. For example, in 2020, we set aspirational hiring goals and focused on growing our offices outside California and New York to improve representation. We’ll continue to invest in states across the U.S. — and in many countries globally — but in the future we will no longer have aspirational goals.

You mentioned we’ll evaluate our programs. Can you share more about that?

Melonie Parker and her team will lead on closely and carefully evaluating programs, trainings, and initiatives, and will update them as needed — including those that raise risk, or that aren’t as impactful as we’d hoped. She’ll work with senior leaders across the company.

And is there anything else you want Googlers to know now?

While there will be changes, our central Employee Resource Groups will remain, as will our work with colleges and universities, and our work to build products to help all our users and partners. That is all vital work for our business and our Googler community.

Statement omitted from SEC filing

Google not only company to end DEI program

Google is removing its previous goal of increasing hires from underrepresented groups and is reevaluating some of its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives, reports Reuters. In a memo, Google-parent Alphabet's Chief People Officer Fiona Cicconi, said “In 2020, we set ambitious hiring goals and aimed to expand representation by growing offices outside California and New York”.“However, moving forward, we will no longer set aspirational goals.”Additionally, Google is assessing changes to its policies in response to federal guidelines introduced during Donald Trump's presidency, which sought to limit DEI efforts in government and among federal contractors.""Because we are a federal contractor, our teams are also evaluating changes to our programs required to comply with recent court decisions and U.S. Executive Orders on this topic,"" Cicconi said in the email.Despite these shifts, Google stated it would maintain internal employee groups like ""Trans at Google,"" ""Black Googler Network,"" and the ""Disability Alliance,"" which contribute to product and policy decisions.In its latest annual filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Alphabet also omitted a statement previously included in reports from 2021 to 2024, which read that the company is ""committed to making diversity, equity and inclusion part of everything we do and to growing a workforce that is representative of the users we serve.” A company spokesperson explained that the line was removed as part of its review of DEI initiatives .For years, Google had been a leading advocate for inclusive policies, especially following the 2020 protests against the police killings of George Floyd and other Black Americans. That same year, CEO Sundar Pichai announced a target for 30% of Google's leadership to come from underrepresented groups by 2025. At the time, 96% of the company’s US leaders were white or Asian, and 73% of leaders globally were men.Other major companies are also scaling back DEI programs. In January, Meta, Facebook's parent company, announced it was discontinuing some DEI initiatives, including those related to hiring, training, and supplier selection. Similarly, Amazon stated in an internal memo that it was phasing out ""outdated programs and materials"" tied to diversity and inclusion.","Google is removing its previous goal of increasing hires from underrepresented groups.

The proposed bill, crafted by bipartisan representatives Darin LaHood (Republican) and Josh Gottheimer (Democratic), aims to prevent what lawmakers see as a potential information security threat.The Wall Street Journal reported that the legislative move is driven by similar national security considerations that led to the ban of TikTok last year. ""This should be a no-brainer in terms of actions we should take immediately to prevent our enemy from getting information from our government,"" Gottheimer emphasized.Despite the mounting challenges, DeepSeek continues to gain popularity. The app's rapid rise has been remarkable, becoming the most downloaded app in America and boasting an open-source model that has been widely embraced by consumers and businesses. However, its Chinese origins have triggered scrutiny, with US government agencies like the Navy and NASA already restricting its use.Asides Navy and NASA, Texas became the first US state to block the AI application on government devices, with Governor Greg Abbott stating, ""Texas will not allow the Chinese Communist Party to infiltrate our state's critical infrastructure through data-harvesting AI and social media apps.""Cybersecurity experts have raised significant concerns about the app's data practices.

NYT Connections hints for February 7



<<<<<<< Updated upstream
TikTok parent ByteDance has developed a new AI model called OmniHuman-1 . The latest model can generate realistic videos from photos and sound bites. This comes after ChatGPT-maker OpenAI expanded access to its video-generation tool, Sora, making it available to ChatGPT Plus and Pro users in December 2024. Last year, Google DeepMind also announced its Veo model which can create “high-quality, high-definition videos based on text or image prompts in a wide range of cinematic and visual styles with exceptional speed.” However, both OpenAI and Google's models that turn photos into videos are still not available to the public.In a paper (seen by the South China Morning Post), the ByteDance team behind OmniHuman-1 claimed that the multimodal model excels at creating videos of people speaking, singing, and moving with a quality “significantly outperforming existing audio-conditioned human video-generation methods”. While OmniHuman-1 has not yet been publicly released, sample videos have generated significant buzz online. One of the demo videos shows a 23-second clip of Albert Einstein giving a speech that was shared on YouTube.In a recently published technical paper, ByteDance researchers Lin Gaojie, Jiang Jianwen, Yang Jiaqi, Zheng Zerong, and Liang Chao introduced a new training strategy that integrates diverse datasets of text, audio and movement to enhance video-generation models. With this approach, the company aims to tackle challenges faced by global researchers in scaling such models.ByteDance also claimed that its method advances conventional video generation without directly naming competing AI tools. The researchers highlighted that their data-mixing approach allows for realistic video generation across various aspect ratios and body proportions, ranging from close-up facial shots to full-body visuals.The generated clips exhibit detailed facial expressions synchronised with audio, along with natural head and gesture movements, potentially enabling broader real-world applications.Among the sample videos released, one features a man delivering a TED Talk-style speech with lifelike hand gestures and synchronised lip movements, making it nearly indistinguishable from a real recording, the report adds.","Tiktok parent bytedance has developed a new ai model called omnihuman-1.

AI researchers develop 'reasoning' model for under $50 like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek's R1,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/ai-researchers-develop-reasoning-model-for-under-50-like-openais-o1-and-deepseeks-r1/articleshow/117986776.cms,"How researchers developed reasoning model

A team of AI researchers from Stanford University and the University of Washington have achieved a breakthrough in AI development by training a sophisticated “reasoning” model for less than $50 in cloud compute credits. Researchers used AI models by Google, Alibaba to create a chatbot with reasoning level as good as the ChatGPT-maker OpenAI ’s o1 LLMs.The model, named s1, is claimed to exhibit performance comparable to cutting-edge reasoning models like OpenAI's o1 and DeepSeek's R1 on tests evaluating math and coding abilities. The s1 model , along with the data and code used in its training, has been made available on GitHub.The researchers behind s1 said that they utilised a readily available base model and refined it through a process known as distillation – a technique that involves extracting the “reasoning” capabilities from another AI model by training s1 on its answers.The researchers claim that their model s1 has been distilled from Google's Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking Experimental model. This approach mirrors the method used by Berkeley researchers who created an AI reasoning model for around $450 last month.The researchers behind s1 aimed to identify the simplest approach to achieve strong reasoning performance and ""test-time scaling,"" which allows an AI model to deliberate more before generating a response.“Test-time scaling is a promising new approach to language modeling that uses extra test-time compute to improve performance,” the researchers said in their paper published last week (via TechCrunch), adding that they “seek the simplest approach to achieve test-time scaling and strong reasoning performance.”The s1 research suggests that reasoning models can be effectively distilled using a relatively small dataset and a process called supervised fine-tuning (SFT), where an AI model is explicitly trained to mimic specific behaviors in the dataset.“First, we curate a small dataset s1K of 1,000 questions paired with reasoning traces relying on three criteria we validate through ablations: difficulty, diversity, and quality. Second, we develop budget forcing to control test-time compute by forcefully terminating the model’s thinking process or lengthening it by appending “Wait” multiple times to the model’s generation when it tries to end. This can lead the model to doublecheck its answer, often fixing incorrect reasoning steps,” the researchers said.","Researchers from stanford university and the university of washington have trained a sophisticated “reasoning” model for less than $50 in cloud compute credits.

“Dear fellow shareholders,

A few weeks ago, on December 23rd, we entered the BSE Sensex. Coincidentally, that was exactly the day I started writing the first line of code for Zomato — then Foodiebay — seventeen years ago, in 2007. Becoming the first tech startup in India to make it to the Sensex is a moment of pride and also a moment of reflection, bringing with it a heightened sense of responsibility — responsibility towards the people we serve, the people who build with us, and the country we live in.

In many ways, we feel like we’ve broken some ice. In a world where success often seems reserved for the privileged, we have shown that people from ordinary backgrounds, armed with nothing but conviction and hard work, can come together, defy the odds, create large-scale impact, and, in under two decades, build one of the top thirty listed companies in India. This journey has created tremendous wealth — not just for me, but for our employees, institutional investors, and retail shareholders. But I did not start Zomato to make money. I started it because I wanted to do something worthwhile with my life. One weekend, I went around town, collected takeaway menus, and uploaded them onto a website — purely in the spirit of service. I never thought it could be a business. I wasn’t looking for revenue. I was simply trying to be helpful.

Zomato is an accidental company. It was born out of a simple desire to serve, and over time, it became a business. And the journey has been nothing short of extraordinary. Our work has created millions of direct and indirect jobs. It endears my heart when our delivery partners, restaurant partners, and store partners tell me how we empower them, to make more money, to have more freedom, and to better provide for their families. A lot of them tell me that they are now able to send their kids to better schools, and are able to keep them in those schools, which was sometimes not possible earlier. They tell me that their life is more full of hope than what it used to be.

I am a student of system design thinking, and one of the goals for me at Zomato has been to design an organisation that lasts beyond its current set of leaders – an organisation where culture drives outcomes, more than strategy; something that is an institution in itself, and not just a company.

We shape our institutions, and then they shape us. But institutions are not just legal entities, groups of people, or physical structures; they are also the mental models and paradigms within which we operate. One such paradigm, often overlooked in shaping a company’s future, is its name.

When we acquired Blinkit, we started using “Eternal” (instead of Zomato) internally to distinguish between the company and the brand/app. We also thought that we would publicly rename the company to Eternal, the day something beyond Zomato became a significant driver of our future. Today, with Blinkit, I feel we are there. We would like to rename Zomato Ltd., the company (not the brand/app), to Eternal Ltd.

Eternal is a powerful name, and to be honest, it scares me to my core. It is a tall order to live up to. Because ‘Eternal’ carries both a promise and a paradox. True permanence isn’t built on bold claims of invincibility or the swagger of success. It is forged in the quiet understanding that our immortality stems from our mortality — because the day we think we will last forever simply because we declare it, we begin our end.

To work at Eternal will be to wake up every day knowing that our forever is earned in moments of self-doubt, in acknowledging our limitations, in our constant hunger to be better than we were yesterday.

This isn’t just a name change; it is a mission statement. A reminder etched into our identity that we will endure — not because we are here, but because we need to get there.

Our Board has approved this change today and I request our shareholders to also support this change. If and when it is approved, our corporate website will transition from zomato.com to eternal.com. We will also change our stock ticker from ZOMATO to ETERNAL. Eternal will comprise four major businesses (as of now) – Zomato, Blinkit, District, and Hyperpure.

A company has multiple founding moments, and I hope this change is another one in our journey into the future.

Amazon faces heightened pressure to deliver strong cloud computing results in its upcoming fourth-quarter earnings report, as recent disappointing performances from tech rivals Microsoft and Google have raised questions about massive AI investments across the industry.Major tech stocks have experienced significant gains over the past two years, driven by expectations that AI technologies would fuel sustained datacenter expansion. However, recent developments, including Chinese startup DeepSeek's claimed AI breakthroughs at reduced costs, have triggered a technology sector selloff.""

This comes as the company prepares to unveil its delayed Alexa generative AI voice service later this month.""We actually believe that AWS is regaining share,"" explains D.A.

What are NYT Strands and how to play the game?

Strands is a puzzle game that blends elements of Connections, Spelling Bee, and classic crossword puzzles. Players are given 48 letters arranged on a 6 x 8-inch grid, along with a daily theme. The goal is to solve the Spangram and uncover all the theme-related words.

To play, connect letters on the grid to form words by dragging your mouse or fingers (on a touchscreen) in horizontal, vertical, or diagonal directions.

Start by identifying the central theme word or Spangram, which will help you understand the puzzle’s theme.

In addition to the Spangram, you must also find other words related to the theme hidden in the grid. Once you’ve uncovered them all, the puzzle is complete.

Tips for solving NYT Strands puzzle

Identify the theme words: Fill in the grid with the theme words. Once found, they will be highlighted in blue and won't overlap with each other.

Find the Spangram: Identify the Spangram, a key part of the puzzle that connects two opposite sides of the grid. It encapsulates the theme and may consist of two words. The Spangram will be highlighted in yellow once you’ve located it.

Take advantage of hints: Pay attention to off-topic words for clues. For every three non-theme words you uncover, letters will be highlighted to give you a hint toward finding a theme word, without directly revealing it
