‘Social media giants must be accountable’

NEW DELHI: Information and broadcasting minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said Thursday social media platforms should compensate creators of the content they use for earning billions in profit.“Social media platforms must also share revenue in a fair way with the people who are creating content, whether it is news persons, conventional media, creators in far-flung areas, influencers, or professors and researchers disseminating their work using the platforms. .. there has to be a fair share of revenue with the people who are creating the content,” Vaishnaw said at the Storyboard 18 Digital News Publishers Association Conclave.Information and broadcasting minister Ashwini Vaishnaw’s pitch for “fair compensation” comes amid a debate raging globally over the refusal of social media giants to compensate creators of content which they have used to make huge profits.The conduct of platforms was under focus in the deliberations at the conclave, with Vaishnaw saying that social media companies can no longer function as neutral intermediaries. They now operate like publishers and must be accountable for the content they host and amplify, he said.Vaishnaw said internet’s evolution into a powerful media ecosystem demands a redistribution of responsibility. “The nature of internet has changed... today it has become a powerful media outlet, where, like media, the platforms must take responsibility,” he said, adding, “Platforms must take responsibility for what they are publishing.”Warning deepfakes, disinformation and synthetic media are corroding public trust, the minister said the damage goes beyond individual harm. “The entire society is built upon trust in institutions... that core tenet of trust is under threat,” he said, pointing to the rapid spread of fabricated images and videos through algorithm-driven virality.The I&B minister also emphasised that synthetic content must not be created without explicit consent.","Information and broadcasting minister ashwini vaishnaw said social media platforms should compensate creators of the content they use for earning billions in profit. “social media platforms must also share revenue in a fair way with the people who are creating content, whether it is news persons, conventional media, creators in far-flung areas, influencers, or professors and researchers disseminating their work using the platforms,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128834384,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-686631,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

For example if you’re a platform you might not like the guidelines that have come about these intermediaries. Whereas you look from the shoes of digital media, in an age of AI, deepfakes, the credibility, research and authenticity of work is in question.”Highlighting his journey through different media platforms Shivnath Thukral, VP Public Policy & Government Affairs, PhonePe (former Public Policy VP at Meta), said after working through different mediums “I can hardly complain that policy hasn’t been an enabler.”He went on to say, “there must be a reason why all the platforms like Facebook, Google, and all have the largest market base in India.There must be a reason why RBI is working towards policy enabling with the Government of India support.

The regulation in the digital ecosystem including digital media has created a lot of space for innovation. ”Asserting the importance of regulation for a good economy Supreme Court lawyer, Vivek Narayan Sharma, said “there is no question of no regulation and operating, for good economy and a stable economy regulations have to be in place. If they are not in place everything will go haywire, everyone will do what they want and there will be no control.”Sharma also spoke about an important question that how much control should be there and to what extent.

The Digital News Publishers Association (DNPA) Conclave 2026 took place in New Delhi on Thursday, bringing together India’s foremost digital media leaders. The event focused on the dynamic evolution of news, governance, and digital innovation, centered around the theme: “The New World Order of News: Rewriting the Playbook for a Resilient Digital Future. ”During the DNPA Conclave 2026, the panel “From Creation to Compensation: Content Economics”, moderated by Prasad Sanyal, Group Business Head at TimesofIndia.com Indiatimes.com , and Whatshot, delved into the intricacies of content economics. The discussion explored building trust, monetization strategies, and the importance of a digital-first approach in today’s evolving media ecosystem.Speaking at the Conclave, Nandini Bhalla, Editor-in-Chief of The Word Magazine and former editor of Harper’s Bazaar, Cosmopolitan, Brides Today, and Grazia, highlighted the enduring value of print principles in digital journalism: “The Word is digital with a heart of print. All those values that print stands for—trust, research, journalism—we bring them into the digital world where our audience sits. Digital is where all of the action is, but content will always be king, whether it’s on paper or on your phones. ”Malini Agarwal, Founder of MissMalini and Co-founder of IF, emphasized the role of authenticity and reliability in digital content: “Anyone can create content. But who do you trust? Whose content do you trust is where the real value lies.Print still has that strength of authenticity, and digital has the pace. The ones that survive will be truthful.”Dhruv Chitgopekar, Co-founder & Partner, Collective Artists Network, added, “Trust is no longer a nice-to-have. Consistency, authenticity, and depth in your content are critical. Digital magnifies the need to be yourself, to be credible, and to invest in your subject expertise.”DNPA Conclave 2026 served as a key platform where policymakers, media leaders, and industry experts came together to discuss the evolving world of news, governance, and digital innovation.

DNPA Conclave 2026: Why getting Indian users to pay for news remains a tough sell,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dnpa-conclave-2026-why-getting-indian-users-to-pay-for-news-remains-a-tough-sell/articleshow/128816840.cms,"DNPA Conclave 2026

Leaders from media, technology, and policy convened on Thursday to chart the future of journalism in a rapidly evolving digital landscape, at the Fourth Annual Digital News Publishers Association (DNPA) Conclave 2026. Held under the theme “Rewriting the Playbook for a Resilient Digital Future,” the event highlighted conversations around trust, innovation, artificial intelligence, regulation, and sustainable growth, setting the stage for deeper debates on the structural challenges facing the industry.During the final panel discussion of the event titled “Getting the Indian User to Pay,” executives from media, technology, and consumer platforms converged on a sobering reality: while subscriptions are widely seen as one of industry’s long-term goal, the path to scale remains complex.Avinash Mudaliar, CEO of OTTPLAY, framed the struggle as fundamentally behavioural. Drawing a sharp contrast between news and streaming platforms, he argued that the gap is less technological and more psychological. “OTTs solve for dopamine, news solves for cortisol,” Mudaliar observed, suggesting that entertainment platforms are designed around reward cycles. “You're are not literally craving attention; you're are craving retention.That’s the bus we seem to be missing.”He noted that OTT platforms simplify sampling for users. “News makes sampling so tough. If you read two articles, the third asks you to pay. OTT has it simple — sample for a month, watch multiple episodes, then decide whether to stay.”Mudaliar also pushed back against the idea that video-led news subscriptions alone could unlock growth, citing the ad-supported success of platforms like YouTube. “News OTT won't work unless you approach it differently — with focus on the story, not just information.”From a consumer-platform lens, Anurag P, VP Product at Swiggy, shared lessons from SwiggyOne’s subscription model. “We’re not selling free deliveries; we’re selling mental bandwidth to users,” he said, emphasising the importance of reducing user friction.“How do you make the whole process friction-free?” he explained was the idea on his mind, adding that publishers must identify where friction emerges in news too, citing examples like rigid paywalls or overwhelming content abundance.Subscriptions, the panel agreed, also need flexibility. Mudaliar highlighted experiments with pause features. “We introduced a pause. If you’ve taken a yearly subscription but want to pause, you can. It’s about being truthful to users.”With Neeraj Sharma, Managing Director at Accenture, the conversation shifted a little, offering a pragmatic view on enterprise-scale subscription opportunities. “The simple answer is no,” he said when asked about the viability of B2B news subscriptions in India. “For any enterprise to invest widely, you need very unique content or depth. The same news is available everywhere.”To build paying communities, Sharma argued, publishers must go deeper rather than wider. “Build depth content — like a community — with real-world opportunities and unique conversations. That’s when subscriptions might sell.”Jaideep Karnik, Head of Digital and Editor at Amar Ujala, echoed the structural challenge. “Subscriptions are not working, really,” he admitted, pointing to the historical economics of Indian news.“When people were paying for news, only a small fraction came from readers. The majority came from advertisers. We have not made people used to paying for news.”Karnik underlined the behavioural hurdle: “If even one source of news is free, people will not pay. It is also about habit. This cannot change in one day.”As the discussion went on, panellists outlined what they believed could realistically persuade Indian users to open their wallets.Jaideep Karnik stressed that news alone may not be enough to drive payment behaviour. “People will not pay for news, but for experience. What will you give?” he said, pointing to the need for publishers to rethink value creation and options like packaged 'bundles' with multiple news-related products.Neeraj Sharma argued that depth, not volume, could unlock subscription potential. “Depth,” he said, emphasising the importance of specialised, high-value content and community-led offerings.Avinash Mudaliar highlighted accessibility as a decisive factor. “Ease of access,” he noted.From a product standpoint, Anurag P offered a more personal view, pointing to the kind of utility-driven experience that could resonate with users. “I would pay for something that gives me the most important news in three minutes every morning, without clutter,” he said, which pointed to the viability in personalisation.The discussion ultimately signalled that success may depend less on rigid paywalls alone and more on psychology, personalisation, and designing experiences users genuinely value.","Dnpa conclave 2026 was held in new delhi on thursday.

NEW DELHI: Veteran journalist and news anchor Sudhir Chaudhary on Thursday shared his reflections on the evolution of television journalism and the fast-changing landscape of digital news during a session at the Fourth Annual Digital News Publishers Association (DNPA) Conclave 2026 in New Delhi.In an engaging conversation moderated by RJ Raunac — the artist, entertainer, and entrepreneur popularly known as “Bauaa” — the discussion, themed “The new world order of news: rewriting the playbook for a resilient digital future”, explored how technology continues to redefine storytelling, credibility, and audience engagement in modern newsrooms.Responding to a question about the dramatic shift from the early days of television to the rise of the digital and AI-driven era, Chaudhary traced his journey from the mid-1990s, when India’s TV news industry was just taking root.“When I began my career in 1994–95, television was just taking off in India. There was only one news bulletin a day, aired around 9 or 10 pm. People would wait eagerly for that slot, believing it marked the dawn of a new era in broadcasting. It was truly just the beginning,” he said, recalling how the medium evolved from a single nightly bulletin to over 400 channels running 24 hours across the country today.Sharing anecdotes from his early reportage, Chaudhary highlighted the challenges of telling stories when technology was limited.He recounted how, during the Kargil War in 1999, which he called India’s first “televised war,” sending footage from the conflict zone to Delhi took up to two days, often leaving reporters anxious and helpless.Sharing another memory from the 2002 Parliament attack, he said, “I had the best visuals, best footage of the incident, but there was no medium to send it from the Parliament to my office in Noida. Though OB vans were a thing, we did not have OB vans available that day.”Reflecting on how far the industry has come, he observed that despite the tools changing—from broadcast to social media, and now AI—certain core principles have remained constant.“People say TV is dying now since it’s being taken over by social media, which is also being challenged by AI. But I feel certain things have not changed,” he said.Emphasising the enduring essence of journalism, Chaudhary noted, “Storytelling, clarity, and responsibility — these things have never changed. Technology can create content for you, but the emotion and intent behind the content will always be driven by you.”The DNPA Conclave 2026 brought together policymakers, editors, technologists, and industry leaders to deliberate on the future of news in an AI-led world. The day’s sessions examined how innovation, regulation, and ethics can coexist to shape a trustworthy and sustainable digital media environment for the next decade.","Sudhir chaudhary was speaking at the fourth annual digital news publishers association (dnpa) conclave 2026 in new delhi.

CEA says India ready for 270 GW peak demand; Discoms must ensure reliable supply,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cea-says-india-ready-for-270-gw-peak-demand-discoms-must-ensure-reliable-supply/articleshow/128810648.cms,"-

NEW DELHI: With power demand likely to touch 265-270 gigawatts (GW) this year, Central Electricity Authority (CEA) chairman Ghanshyam Prasad said the system was “well-prepared” to meet the requirement and that it was now for distribution companies to ensure reliable supply to consumers.Talking to, Prasad said the government was ready to meet the 270 GW demand in 2025 itself, but a good monsoon ensured that the requirement remained lower than the previous year, when it had touched 250 GW. He added that nearly 52 GW of additional capacity had already been added in the first 10 months of the 2025–26 financial year, while another 10 GW was likely to be commissioned in the remaining two months.While peak demand during the summer of 2025 reached 242.8 GW, it crossed 245 GW in Jan this year — the highest so far in the 2025–26 financial year.Prasad said discoms had been given resource adequacy plans and must not only tie up with generation companies to secure sufficient electricity but also invest in strengthening their distribution networks.“It is their responsibility to put in capital expenditure, strengthen their distribution network and make it N-1 compliant as far as possible so that they are able to supply power even if there is a contingency,” he said.He added that some private discoms in cities such as Ahmedabad, Mumbai and Delhi already have N-1 compliant networks at the 33 kV substation level, resulting in negligible outages.The CEA is also stepping up efforts to sensitise linemen in both the transmission and distribution segments about the use of proper safety gear while on duty. Calling them critical to maintaining reliable supply, Prasad said an event would be organised on ‘Lineman Diwas’ on March 7, where workers from across states will share best practices.At the same time, Prasad cautioned that ensuring zero outages requires significant investment in the distribution network, which inevitably has tariff implications. Citing the example of data centres that require uninterrupted, high-quality 24x7 power, he said such facilities are typically connected through two feeders. “Reliability always comes at a cost. If a residential pocket wants that kind of supply, it can petition the state electricity commission. I am sure the discom won’t be able to ignore it,” he said. He added, however, that most consumers prefer lower tariffs even if that means brief outages of 5–10 or even 30 minutes.Despite India being a power-surplus country, many urban pockets continue to face outages, largely because of local distribution faults.On the financial health of discoms, Prasad said the situation had begun to improve, crediting the Revamped Distribution Sector Scheme (RDSS), which mandates timely release of subsidy by state govts. He said this was among the reasons discoms posted a cumulative profit of Rs 2,700 crore for the first time. Installation of smart prepaid meters under RDSS is also aiding better and advance revenue collection while helping curb power theft. States such as Bihar and Assam, he said, have shown notable progress and set an example for others. Of the nearly 20 crore smart meters targeted under the scheme, over 5.2 crore have already been installed.",Power demand likely to touch 265-270 gigawatts (gw) this year.

India’s digital news ecosystem is at a critical juncture, as technology, artificial intelligence, regulatory frameworks, and audience expectations converge to reshape the future of journalism.At the Fourth Annual Digital News Publishers Association Conclave 2026, leaders from media, technology, and policy discussed how credibility, verified content, and India’s expanding digital public infrastructure are redefining the responsibilities and opportunities for news organisations.Technology can strengthen journalism by amplifying credible and responsible reporting, S. Krishnan, Secretary, MeitY, said, stressing the need to prioritise authenticated information in an era of rapid digital change.“If you create the right kind of content, technology will help you amplify the right kind of message.""He highlighted the public responsibility of publishers to ensure verified and curated information receives precedence over unverified material circulating online.“There's a social duty, and there's a social necessity of creating authenticated content. Any content which is authenticated and curated clearly needs to have priority and more privilege than any other content which is just randomly put up there.”The conclave also underscored the convergence of pressures on Indian media. Artificial intelligence adoption, regulatory recalibration, advertiser scrutiny, and audience mistrust are unfolding simultaneously, compressing change and reducing the space for trial-and-error strategies.Publishers are now facing structural decisions that will determine long-term direction rather than short-term growth, particularly in a diverse market marked by linguistic variety, uneven connectivity, and massive youth participation.Adding perspective on India’s digital foundations, Anil Kumar Lahoti, chairman of the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, spoke during a fireside chat on The Evolving Telecom & Digital Infrastructure Landscape, highlighting how telecom and digital systems are transforming access to information and connectivity.Vineet Nayar, founder-chairman of Sampark Foundation and former CEO of HCL Technologies, addressed The Architecture of India’s Digital Identity, explaining how India’s public digital infrastructure—spanning governance, finance, and identity—is reshaping citizen expectations around access, authentication, and trust.For media organisations, this signals that credibility, inclusion, and accessibility are no longer optional—they are central to their role.India’s digital public infrastructure positions technology as civic architecture, placing media at the heart of a broader ecosystem of digital citizenship. Globally, India is being observed as a model for integrating technology, governance, and public interest, with media serving as both a participant and a stakeholder in this transformation.The conclave, held under the theme “Rewriting the Playbook for a Resilient Digital Future,” brought together leaders to explore how trust, innovation, AI, regulation, and sustainable growth will shape the next phase of India’s news industry.","Leaders from media, technology, and policy discussed how credibility, verified content, and india’s expanding digital public infrastructure are redefining the responsibilities and opportunities for news organisations.

The Fourth Annual Digital News Publishers Association Conclave (DNPA) 2026 brought together leaders from media, technology and policy to deliberate on the future of journalism in an increasingly complex digital environment.Held under the theme “Rewriting the Playbook for a Resilient Digital Future,” the conclave focused on trust, innovation, artificial intelligence, regulation and sustainable growth, signalling a decisive moment for India’s digital news ecosystem.The session began with a keynote address by Sunil Kant Munjal, Chairman of Hero Enterprises. He examined why long-term capital remains limited for digital news networks. Munjal described the sector as relatively new but critical in shaping information distribution.He stressed that building trust with audiences is fundamental to longevity. From an investor’s standpoint, he highlighted the importance of diversified revenue streams, questioning whether companies remain overly dependent on advertising or are exploring alternatives such as subscriptions and events.He also observed that over the last two decades, investor approaches toward enterprises have undergone a dramatic shift, with greater emphasis on sustainable and scalable business models.The first panel discussion, titled “From reach to results, influence vs performance: Where does digital news fit in the new media equation?” examined digital news from an agency lens.The panel comprised of Ashwin Padmanabhan (WPP Media), Kartik Sharma (Omnicom Media Group India), Vinod Thadani (Dentsu Media & iPROSPECT) and Santosh P Kumar (Innocean India).The session was moderated by Hemant Jain (Lokmat Media Group), where he questioned whether the industry is facing a perspective, product or measurement problem.Kartik Sharma pointed out that measurement frameworks need sharper focus, highlighting that many clients still buy media based on impressions. He suggested moving towards defined target reach metrics for better outcomes. Vinod Thadani added that “performance” carries different meanings depending on the publisher and context, indicating that standardised definitions remain a challenge.The second panel discussion, titled “The new economics of content in the AI age,” explored monetisation and content credibility amid rapid technological change.Participants included Toshit Panigrahi (TollBit), Gowthaman Ragothaman (Saptharushi), Marcus Pousette (Magnite), Aaron Rigby (Taboola) and Bharat Gupta (ToBe & former CEO, Jagran New Media). The session was moderated by Puneet Jain (CEO, HT Digital).While acknowledging that AI is disrupting traditional models, speakers agreed it also presents opportunities to redefine content creation and distribution. Responding to a question on whether AI-led monetisation could generate significant revenue within the next 12 months, Gowthaman Ragothaman cautioned that one year may be too short to make firm predictions.Bharat Gupta emphasised that the ecosystem has shifted from simple content discovery and engagement to more complex monetisation pathways, urging publishers to adapt and redefine production strategies in response to changing discovery mechanisms.","The fourth annual digital news publishers association conclave (dnpa) 2026 brought together leaders from media, technology and policy.

DNPA Conclave 2026: Ashwini Vaishnaw says social media platforms must fairly share revenue with content creators,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dnpa-conclave-2026-ashwini-vaishnaw-says-social-media-platforms-must-fairly-share-revenue-with-content-creaters/articleshow/128804263.cms,"Fair Pay, Consent, Online Safety: Ashwini Vaishnaw Draws Red Line For Digital Platforms

NEW DELHI: Union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Thursday urged social media platforms to share the revenue fairly with the content creators. Further highlighting the shift in digital platform operations, he asserted that platforms must take responsibility for the content they host. He said user consent must be mandatory for ""all synthetically generated"" content and called on digital platforms to take proactive steps to curb cyber fraud Speaking at the Fourth Annual Digital News Publishers Association Conclave 2026 in New Delhi, Vaishnaw said, ""Platforms must take responsibility of what they are publishing. Times have gone when a platform could say that they are responsible for the content. Those times have gone because the platforms have themselves changed from being pure platforms to becoming hosts to the world. They must take the responsibility for the harmful content which is hosted by them. ""The minister further said, ""I will request all the platforms to rethink their revenue-sharing policies because that is also one of the major concerns that the entire society today is raising. If this is not done voluntarily, then there are so many countries which have shown the path to get it done in a legal way.""Emphasising the importance of trust in democratic systems, Vaishnaw said, “Human society is built upon trust and institutions.When human beings created the social structures. They created so many institutions beginning with the institution of family, a social identity, judiciary, media, legislature and a democratic way of coming together and deciding things.”The Minister also noted that the growth of science and arts depends on respecting original work.""The people who created copyrights, the people who created the original content, the society grew on the basis of that intellectual property. And if that intellectual property is not well respected and not fairly compensated, then the growth of the society, the growth of science, the growth of technology, the growth of arts, the growth of literature, that will all get stunted and the human growth which has happened over past thousands of years will get delayed, will get muted, will get stunted. That incentive for creating the original work and getting that fair compensation and fair appreciation from sections of the society, from the entire society, must be respected, must be valued,"" he said.Warning that this foundation is under strain, Vaishnaw said, “The way the world is emerging today, that core tenet of trust is under threat. That threat is coming from so many different angles, deepfakes which can make you believe in things which have never happened anywhere.”“Disinformation barrage which can cause a sense of distrust, which doesn't exist in real life. Creating synthetically generated photos and videos which have absolutely no relation with reality. And all that content when it reaches the common citizen. They start questioning the very basic structure of the society. And this is a big threat that every country including India is juggling with these issues now,” he added.Earlier, DNPA Chairperson and Manorama Online CEO Mariam Mammen Mathew opened the conclave, saying artificial intelligence and rapid shifts in the digital ecosystem are fundamentally reshaping how news is created, distributed, discovered and monetised.Speaking on the theme she said, ""Transformation of Media in the Age of Artificial Intelligence is at a critical juncture as AI, evolving data governance norms, shifting platform economics and changing audience behaviour redefine digital journalism.""The DNPA Conclave 2026 brought together policymakers, media leaders and industry experts to discuss the rapidly evolving landscape of news, governance and digital innovation. As a key industry platform, the conclave featured curated panel discussions and expert-led sessions examining emerging trends, addressing shared challenges and outlining a forward-looking roadmap for India’s digital media ecosystem.Discussions focused on the evolving regulatory environment governing digital communications and how policy frameworks can balance innovation with consumer protection and industry growth in an AI-driven era. Sessions also explored how artificial intelligence is transforming newsroom workflows, content creation, distribution strategies and audience engagement across platforms.The conclave further examined where audiences are turning for credible information, how trust can be built and sustained, and what constitutes the new public square in a fragmented, platform-led media landscape. The impact of regulatory changes on various stakeholders was also discussed, including who stands to benefit, who bears the costs, and how the ecosystem can remain competitive and inclusive.","Union minister ashwini vaishnaw urged social media platforms to share the revenue fairly with the content creators.

I&B Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw Sounds Big Alert On Cybercrime, Pushes Fair Revenue For Creators

Trust has emerged as the central pillar of the future news ecosystem, with credibility increasingly shaping audience loyalty, advertiser confidence and long-term relevance in a saturated digital environment.At the Fourth Annual Digital News Publishers Association Conclave 2026, discussions focused on how trust has moved beyond a moral value to become functional infrastructure for media organisations. In an era of abundant content and rising misinformation, credibility now determines discoverability, sustainability and public confidence.The rise of AI-generated content has intensified this shift. As creation becomes easier and faster, verification is becoming the key differentiator for newsrooms. Participants noted that audiences in the post-virality phase of digital media are more sceptical and reward sources that demonstrate rigour, transparency and accountability.Brands are also reassessing where they place advertising, evaluating the credibility of media environments rather than just scale of impressions. At the same time, revenue streams such as subscriptions, donations and premium partnerships are increasingly dependent on trust.Speaking during the conclave, Tanmay Maheshwari, the managing director of Amar Ujala reflected on India’s vast digital base and its implications for media experimentation.“In the Indian context, with 800 million plus internet users, 600 million plus smartphone users, and the cheapest data in the world, it is the breeding ground of all the experiments.”He described India as a deeply engaged digital society while warning of the paradox facing media organisations.“We're not just a digital nation. We're a hyper-digital active society. But here's the irony . we're making more content than ever. we're consuming more content than ever and yet, the media ecosystem is more fragile than ever.”On artificial intelligence in journalism, he stressed the limits of automation compared with on-ground reporting.“AI can summarise , AI can translate, AI can optimise headlines, but I think that AI cannot attend a village in 45 degrees heat and understand the pain of a local villager and share it with the nation so that his voice is heard. all of us in this room have a responsibility that the voices should be heard. propaganda should be curtailed.and the nation should grow.”The conclave, held under the theme “Rewriting the Playbook for a Resilient Digital Future,” brought together leaders from media, technology and policy to examine how trust, innovation, AI, regulation and sustainable growth will shape journalism in the coming decade.","Tanmay maheshwari, md of amar ujala spoke at the digital news publishers association conclave 2026.

Digital News Publishers Association (DNPA) chairperson and Manorama Online CEO Mariam Mammen Mathew on Thursday opened the DNPA conclave and said that artificial intelligence and rapid shifts in the digital ecosystem are fundamentally reshaping how news is created, distributed, discovered and monetised.Speaking at the Fourth Annual Digital News Publishers Association Conclave 2026 on the theme, “Transformation of Media in the Age of Artificial Intelligence,” Mathew said the industry is at a critical juncture as artificial intelligence, evolving data governance norms, shifting platform economics and changing audience behaviour redefine digital journalism.With India preparing to implement a forward-looking AI regulatory framework, she described the dialogue between policymakers and industry leaders as both timely and essential.Mathew said DNPA has worked to ensure that the voice of credible digital publishers remains central to this transformation. The association has engaged with the government on key policy consultations, including the Digital Personal Data Protection framework, discussions on generative AI, copyright and broader regulatory developments affecting digital news.“Strong AI requires strong, credible journalism,” she said, highlighting the need to anchor technological advancement in trust and editorial integrity.Internally, she noted, DNPA has strengthened collaboration among its members, focusing on traffic growth, sustainable monetisation models, newsroom adoption of AI tools and collective opportunities for innovation. Through working groups, policy dialogues and knowledge exchanges, the association aims to ensure that no publisher navigates the ongoing disruption alone.Mathew emphasised that trust remains the core principle amid industry-wide transformation. She said DNPA has brought together policymakers, technology leaders, industry partners and publishers not only to discuss challenges but to co-create solutions. Key concerns include building sustainable monetisation in an AI-mediated ecosystem, protecting intellectual property while enabling innovation, and reducing platform dependency to build traffic resilience.The Digital News Publishers Association represents 21 prominent digital news publishers in India. The body advocates on behalf of its members in engagements with institutions such as the ministry of electronics and information technology, the ministry of information and broadcasting and the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, while also promoting best practices and collaboration across the industry.","Artificial intelligence and rapid shifts in the digital ecosystem are fundamentally reshaping how news is created, distributed, discovered and monetised.

NEW DELHI: Describing BSNL's lavish arrangements for director Vivek Banzal's now called-off trip to Prayagraj ""improper and absurd"", communications minister Jyotiraditya Scindia Wednesday said that ""appropriate action"" will be taken against the senior executive of the state-run company.""I have made it very clear that this is improper and a violation of all the established rules and traditions. It is completely unacceptable in 21st century. It is completely absurd and shocking. A show-cause notice has already been issued to the director with a seven-day response period,"" the minister told reporters.The lavish, four-page instructions detailing snan kits, personal toiletries, undergarments and other comforts, including a retinue of nearly 50 officials to attend to to Banzal and a chief general manager, had sparked concern over misuse of official resources.Showcause notices have been issued to Banzal, a telecom service officer, and two executives - Brijendra Singh, principal GM, and Jogeshwar Verma, DGM, - who were posted in Prayagraj have been transferred. Verma, who was part of Singh's office, had issued the instructions.""We will take strictest possible action. We don't want any distraction from BSNL's focus on improving customer service and network improvement,"" said an official.Banzal had planned a two-day trip to Prayagraj, starting Wednesday, and BSNL had deputed a posse of executives to receive him and take care of arrangements, which included a bath in Ganga. The instructions, running into four pages, asked the PSU staff to arrange for eight sets of ""snan"" or bath kits for men and women, including towels, undergarments, slippers, combs, mirrors, soap, shampoo, and oil, along with a bed sheet.The office order, which went viral on social media, also asked officials to make arrangements at a hotel and circuit house, which included dry fruits, fruit bowls, towels, toiletries, and shaving kits for the director, and other guests. Nearly 50 officials were to be deployed to attend to Banzal and a chief general manager.Following uproar, the telecom service officer called off the trip, which also included visits to temples and some meetings.According to the BSNL website, Banzal's ""never say rest"" attitude and constant innovation have helped drive growth in the fixed-line business. Since 2016, he has been promoting and managing Bharat Fiber, BSNL IT framework and other services.

New GDP data series from today: What are the top changes in the methodology? FAQs answered,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-gdp-data-series-from-today-what-are-the-top-changes-in-the-methodology-faqs-answered/articleshow/128835336.cms,"New GDP series: FAQs answered

New GDP Series : Frequently Asked Questions Answered

1. What is Gross Domestic Product?

2. What is a base year with reference to National Accounts? What is rebasing exercise? What is the importance of this rebasing exercise carried out by MoSPI?

3. What is the frequency of base year revisions undertaken by MoSPI?

4. Why is the GDP base year being revised to FY 2022-23?

5. In the new GDP series, for how many years will the back-series data be provided for? By when can we expect it?

6. How comparable will the revised GDP series be with international statistical standards such as the UN System of National Accounts?

7. Is MoSPI planning to release a detailed document on methodology and data sources used in the new series?

8. What new data are being incorporated in the new GDP series?

GST data: Data from GST are being used for allocation of all-India estimates for private corporate sector across states, and for cross-validation in annual accounts besides its extensive use in quaternization and as an indicator in Quarterly National Accounts.

e-Vahan: Data from e-Vahan are being used to estimate Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE) related to road transport services.

Public Finance Management System (PFMS): Data from the PFMS are being used to compile central government estimates and allocate them among states. This will allow the use of actual expenditure data instead of Revised Estimates (RE) at the FRE stage itself.

Studies: New and updated rates and ratios are being adopted based on recent studies conducted by expert institutions. These include: (i) a grass and fodder study conducted by the Indian Grassland and Fodder Research Institute for agriculture; (ii) fisheries studies conducted by the Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute and the Central Inland Fisheries Research Institute; (iii) a study on milk and milk products conducted by the National Dairy Research Institute for use in Private Final Consumption Expenditure (PFCE); and (iv) a study on transport services conducted by Jawaharlal Nehru University for PFCE.

9. What are the major methodological changes in the new GDP series?

The major methodological improvements include:

Increased dynamism in measuring the household sector: In the old series, the household sector was estimated either through inter-survey growth or through proxy indicators. In the new series, level estimates are being compiled through regular surveys (ASUSE and PLFS) being conducted each year.

Use of double deflation or single extrapolation: In the new series, double deflation is being used in manufacturing and agriculture sector, and single extrapolation elsewhere. Single deflation has been completely done away with. Deflators will also be used at a more granular level. Over 260 granular level CPI for different goods and services are being used in the new GDP series.

Lower discrepancy through Supply and Use Tables: The SUT framework is being integrated with the National Accounts framework to minimise the discrepancy between GDP from production and expenditure approaches. SUT shows what industries produce (Supply) and how products are used by industries or final consumers (Use). A balanced SUT ensures that total supply matches total demand in the economy.

Updated rates and ratios: Rates and ratios used in compilation is being revised from surveys that have become available in the intervening period, or through studies conducted by MoSPI in collaboration with other expert organisations.

Segregation of multi-activity private corporations: In the old series, total value added of multi-activity enterprises was allocated to the major activity of the enterprise. In the new series, as MGT-7/7A data has become available (where corporations are mandated to report activity-wise share in turnover), this is being used to segregate total value added (and other aggregates) across different activities.

More nuanced estimation of PFCE: The new series uses a mixed approach: (a) enhanced use of the Household Consumer Expenditure Survey; (b) direct estimation based on production and other data sources; (c) the commodity flow approach. The latest relevant standard, COICOP 2018, has also been adopted.

New data sources: GST data, PFMS, e-Vahan, and other sources that are more comprehensive and available at a shorter time lag have been explored for augmenting existing data sources for compilation and corroboration of estimates.

10. From where details of improvements listed above can be accessed?

11. What measures have been taken in the new series to capture India’s household sector more comprehensively?

12. Is the contribution of the hired domestic workers (like cooks, drivers, persons cleaning households, etc.) by the households included in the estimation of GDP?

13. How will the revised base year improve measurement of newer sectors like digital services, platform economy, gig workers etc.?

14. Does the new series comprehensively resolve the persistent concerns regarding the accuracy of the GDP deflator?

15. Is MoSPI still using the WPI with 2011-12 base year in calculating GDP estimates in the new series? Will the ministry use the PPI prepared by DPIIT in the new GDP series?

16. What is Supply and Use Table Framework?

17. What is Supply and Use Table Framework?

The Gross Domestic Product or GDP data for the third quarter of the current financial year 2025-26 is set to be released later in the day today. This will be the first GDP data based on the new series that the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation has adopted. India is the world's fastest growing major economy, on its way to become the third largest economy in nominal GDP terms in the coming years.The new series of data not only revises the base year for calculation purposes to 2022-23, it also incorporates several vital changes with an aim to give a more accurate measurement of the size of the Indian economy and its real and nominal GDP growth. What changes in the new GDP data series? Below is a list of FAQs shares by the Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation:Gross Domestic Product, which is commonly known as GDP, is the value of final goods and services produced in the domestic economy in an accounting period. In order to assess the change in economy from one period to another in a meaningful manner, it is important to ensure that same measurement methods and data sources have been used for both the periods.The base year in National Accounts Statistics is the reference year whose prices are used to calculate real growth.Rebasing refers to a process of updating base-period benchmarks with new updated statistics to arrive at a new economic structure that will serve as the basis for estimating gross domestic product and its components, consumer price index and index of industrial production, moving forward.Methodology and data sources used in compilation of GDP and other macro-economic indicators for a particular series are finalized at the time of base year revision and continue for all subsequent years till the base year is revised again.The base year is updated from time to time to reflect the changes that have happened in the economy over the years. This helps make economic data more accurate. It also allows the use of new data sources and better methods for calculating estimates.Under normal conditions, it has been MoSPI’s endeavor to revise the base year periodically in five years, as per international recommendation.The base year of the national accounts is being revised from 2011-12 to 2022-23. MoSPI's endeavour has been to revise the base year every five years. However, year between FY 2017-18 to FY 2021-22 were not suitable as base year:● FY 2017-18:There was major change introduced namely, GST. This required time for consolidation.● FY 2019-20 and FY 2020-21 were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic.● FY 2021-22 witnessed sharp GDP growth largely due to the base effect of post-COVID recovery, making it unsuitable.After detailed discussions, the Advisory Committee on National Accounts Statistics recommended 2022-23 as the new base year. The Committee includes members from various Central Ministries and Departments, State Governments, Academia and Research Institutions. The Committee found FY 2022-23 to be a normal economic year, and important survey data needed for estimating national income was also available for this year.On 27 February, 2026, both the annual and quarterly estimates for the year 2022-23 to 2025-26 will be released. Back series data is expected to be released by December 2026. As per the practice, in India, back-series estimates are recalculated using revised methodology of the new GDP series up to the previous base year. After that, the data is linked at a disaggregated level and extended back to 1950-51. However, the final method for preparing the back-series will be decided in consultation with the Advisory Committee set up to guide MoSPI.India prepares its GDP estimates according to the 2008 System of National of Accounts (SNA 2008), which is a globally accepted standard. The United Nations Statistical Division (UNSD) is now moving from SNA 2008 to SNA 2025. Countries are expected to adopt a new standard during 2029-30. India plans to shift to SNA 2025 in its next base year revision. Besides, India is also a subscriber of IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), which indicates that the country meets all the tests of good statistical citizenship. The revised series is in sync with the international statistical standards.Yes. Methodology and data sources used in compilation of estimates will be presented comprehensively in MoSPI's publication 'Sources and Methods'. The publication is scheduled to be released in the next few months.Several new and improved data sources are being used in the new GDP series to make the estimates more accurate and reliable.Measurement of the Household Sector:Earlier, the household sector was estimated using growth rates between surveys or proxy indicators. In the new series, actual level estimates are being prepared using regular annual surveys such as Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprise (ASUSE) and Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS). These surveys will measure the dynamism in the household sector more accurately and regularly. GST data will also be used to cross-check the estimates obtained from other data sources.Advisory Committee on National Accounts Statistics (ACNAS) was constituted in 2024 to suggest MoSPI, among other things, on issues such as methodological improvements, incorporation of new data sources etc. Five sub-committees were constituted under ACNAS to simultaneously deliberate on specific subjects. 56 experts who were members of these committees deliberated in 40 meetings during the past two years on these issues.The details of above-mentioned improvements are available in the reports of three sub-committees dealing with all-India estimates, which are available on the website of the Ministry. Report of the Sub-committee on Regional Accounts and Sub-committee on SNA Update will be released later.In the old series, the household sector was estimated for the base year using the Survey on Unincorporated Sector Enterprises and the Employment Survey. For later years, estimates were made by extrapolating the base year using growth between surveys or proxy indicators.In the new series, however, actual level estimates of the household sector are being prepared each year using regular surveys such as Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprise (ASUSE) and Periodic Labour Force Survey (PLFS). This approach allows the household sector to be measured more accurately and dynamically, eliminating the need for extrapolation from the base year.Yes, such activities are termed as the “activities of households as employers of domestic personnel” and their contribution is included in the estimation of the GDP. The estimation is based on the number of such workers and their wages as available from the annual PLFS data.All economic activities, including digital services and intermediary platforms etc. were already covered through MCA-21 data for the corporate sector.In the 2022-23 series, with availability of two annual surveys namely, ASUSE and PLFS, the contribution of GDP of these sectors in the household sector (like unincorporated small businesses, self-employed people, informal economic work, etc.) is being more accurately captured annually through these survey-based estimates. ASUSE has dedicated economic activity codes to capture gig workers, such as drivers operating under aggregators (like Ola, Uber, etc. ) and delivery service activities (like Zomato, Swiggy, etc.). All economic activities is being captured more comprehensively in the new series.Yes. An advisory Committee was set up to guide the base revision of GDP. A sub-committee specifically examined issues related to deflators. As per the recommendation of the Committee, in the new series, single deflation has been completely eliminated. In fact, double deflation is being applied in sectors like manufacturing and agriculture. In other sectors, single extrapolation is being used. Deflators are being applied at a more detailed, granular level. These changes are expected to improve the accuracy and reliability of GDP deflators in the new series.The base year revision of WPI is still in progress. Until the updated WPI becomes available, the existing WPI will continue to be used as a deflator. However, it is important to note that the method of use of WPI has undergone change in new series compared to the old series. In the new series, WPI is used at granular level. Separate item-level WPI for output and intermediate consumption are used in Manufacturing sector. Adoption of double deflation in manufacturing sector will enable improved measurement of its GVA estimates compared to old series where same WPI was used for both output and input items. Using WPI at the item level also avoids distortions caused by changes in weights when aggregating across items and sub-categories.Additionally, the Ministry plans to incorporate the PPI in the near future once it is officially released by the DPIIT.The supply and use tables describe how products (goods and services) are brought into an economy (either as a result of domestic production or imports from other countries), and how those same products are used (as intermediate consumption or as final consumption by households, nonprofit institutions serving households (NPISHs), general government or as gross capital formation or as exports). The supply and use tables provide a powerful framework to balance and integrate all the components of the production, income and expenditure approaches to measuring GDP.The supply and use tables describe how products (goods and services) are brought into an economy (either as a result of domestic production or imports from other countries), and how those same products are used (as intermediate consumption or as final consumption by households, nonprofit institutions serving households (NPISHs), general government or as gross capital formation or as exports). The supply and use tables provide a powerful framework to balance and integrate all the components of the production, income and expenditure approaches to measuring GDP.Discrepancies occur because of differences in data coverage across sources, time lags in when information becomes available, use of proxy data for advance estimates, and different estimation methods.As per the System of National Accounts 2008 (SNA 2008) and continued in System of National Accounts 2025 (SNA 2025), the following recommendations are made for handling statistical discrepancy in GDP estimates:i) The statistical discrepancy may be explicitly shown and published alongside official GDP estimates. This enhances transparency enabling users to clearly understand the statistical difference instead of adjusting the estimates to force equality.ii) Another approach is to reconcile the Production/Income and Production side estimates by borrowing strength from Supply and Use Table (SUT) framework.In the new GDP series, the Supply and Use Tables (SUT) framework is being used to reconcile differences between production and expenditure estimates. The SUT framework applies the product-balancing principle, providing a robust way to align divergent data and ensure consistency across all sectors. By integrating SUT framework into GDP compilation, discrepancies in the Final Estimates is being resolved, resulting in internally consistent GDP estimates.Following SNA 2008, the economy has been divided in the following institutional sectors:i. Non-Financial Private Corporations Sector: by using the data on their annual profit & loss account and balance sheet etc. from Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA)ii. Financial Corporations Sector: by using the data of the financial companies, regulators (SEBI, RBI, IRDAI etc.) on the profit & loss account and balance sheet etc.iii. General Government Sector: by using the budget documents of Central and State Governments and PFMS data on the expenditure.iv. Household Sector: for agriculture, using the data on production of crops from the Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers welfare and the price data of the crops from the State/UT Governments, the animal husbandry and fisheries related data from the respective Ministries, for construction sector using the data on different commodities used in the industry from different sources and for the remaining sectors by using the annual surveys conducted by NSO, MoSPI, namely, ASUSE and PLFS.v. Non-Profit Institutions Serving Household (NPISH) Sector: Presently, in India, the estimates for NPISH are included in the Household Sector using the survey data.Estimates for each industry are prepared by institutional sector. For the Household Sector, industries such as Agriculture, Construction, and Ownership of Dwellings use a different methodology than other industries. Detailed explanations of these methods are available in the relevant discussion papers and sub-committee reports.The main data sources for the General Government sector include: Central and state governments budget documents (e.g., receipt budget, detailed demands for grants of all Ministries/Departments), annual accounts of local bodies and autonomous institutions.As government provides services on non-market basis, output of this sector is valued by the sum of the costs incurred in their production, namely, as the sum of Compensation of Employees (CE), Intermediate Consumption (IC) and Consumption of Fixed Capital (CFC). The basic identities in this case are:Under the revised base year (2022–23), the quarterly GDP estimation framework has been strengthened through important methodological improvements, most notably the shift from the earlier Pro-Rata benchmarking method to the Proportional Denton method. The new benchmarking method will remove artificial discontinuities, commonly known as the “step problem,” and ensures smoother and more consistent quarterly series that better reflect underlying short-term movements in economic activity.The new series makes wider and more systematic use of GST data across manufacturing and non-financial services sectors. Outward taxable supply made in the course of business, are comprehensively covered in GST data. Growth in Outward taxable supply for concerned institutional sector of various economic activities is being used as high frequency indicator in compilation of quarterly estimates.FISIM-based approach has been adopted for Financial Services at the quarterly level. Estimation methods for Product Taxes and Subsidies have been strengthened using improved volume indicators, and method for estimating Gross Fixed Capital Formation and Trade in Services at quarterly level are more aligned to the annual approach.In addition, deflation practices have been improved by moving from aggregate deflators to item-level and sector-specific price indices, with greater use of appropriate indices such as CPI, WPI, Unit Value Indices, and service-specific deflators depending on sectoral characteristics.The revised quarterly compilation framework has been aligned more closely with the Annual National Accounts methodology in terms of sectoral classification, deflation strategies, and estimation practices. This harmonisation ensures greater consistency between quarterly and annual GDP and GVA estimates. Also, new benchmarking method adopted in quarterly series will strengthen consistency with annual national accounts series.Several sector-specific refinements have been introduced in deflation method. Double deflation is adopted for Manufacturing sector against the previous practice of single deflation. Under this approach, outputs and inputs are deflated separately using their respective price indices leading to more accurate measurement of real growth of manufacturing sector. Further, deflators such as CPI, WPI, Unit Value Index, etc is being used at more granular level by moving from aggregate level in old series to item-group level in new series. Further, new series of CPI is considered and new series of WPI/PPI is being adopted whenever released in near future.NSO, MoSPI calculates the quarterly GDP estimates using Benchmark-Indicator and this is astandard method used worldwide following the SNA 2008 and IMF’s Quarterly National Accounts Manual 2017. The method works as follows:Benchmarking to annual estimates ensures temporal consistency. High frequency indicators are applied on the benchmark estimates to derive the estimates. Due to divergence of data sources of indicators and the annual estimates in terms of definition and coverage, quarterly estimates are inherently prone to revision. In the new series, adoption of proportional Denton benchmarking enhances, incorporation new data sources and increased granularity and better deflation strategy is likely to institute more stability and robustness of estimates.Yes. As the base year is being changed and the method of calculation is being updated like adding new indicators, using more detailed data, and better ways to adjust for inflation, etc. The annual and quarterly estimates for the years 2022-23 to 2025-26 as per base year 2022-23 will be released on 27 February 2026.NSO, MoSPI issues the guidelines for estimating the GSDP estimates and helps the States and the Union Territories (UT) to estimate their own Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) in a consistent way by providing the guidance and advice following uniform definition, concepts and methodology. The Directorates of Economics and Statistics (DES) of the States/UTs compiles their GSDP using their State/UT-specific data from the same data sources mostly.When the national GDP base year is updated by NSO, MoSPI, the State/UTs also update their GSDP base year to match. This keeps the State/UTs’ GSDP estimates consistent with the national estimate. After the GDP with the updated base year 2022-23 is released, NSO, MoSPI will inform the States/UTs about the methodological changes or improvements in the way GSDP is calculated.Major methodological improvements include: (i) reduction in allocation-based methods in favour of direct estimation for some sectors or sub-sectors, (ii) reduction in reliance on fixed ratios and proxies, (iii) improved use of State-wise information of economic activity, (iv) greater methodological consistency across States.GDP estimate is not only a macro-economic indicator, it is a significant part of the human development at national level. GDP provides contribution of various sectors in the economy and helps formulate appropriate policies, which helps people including farmers, small businesses, manufacturers and service enterprises.For example, earlier, in agriculture, more emphasis was on production of crops like paddy, wheat etc. GDP estimates provide crop wise production figures. Now enhanced focus is being provided for growing of fruits, oilseeds, pulses, fisheries sector etc. Similarly, enhanced emphasis is being provided to the manufacturing sector by the Government. In addition to this, the investment decisions, capacity to take loan etc. are also influenced by the GDP estimates. Thus, it plays a very important role in every citizen’s lives.","New gdp series: faqs answered.

TYLER MYERS HELD OUT FOR TRADE REASONS: HUGE CANUCKS NEWS (Vancouver VS Winnipeg Jets)

Brock Boeser and Tom Willander discuss Tyler Myers' Vancouver Canucks future

The trading deadline is rapidly looming, and uncertainty is still lingering as far as the Vancouver Canucks locker room is concerned. As the team comes to overcome a difficult period, a veteran defenseman in the form of Tyler Myers has turned into the center of persistent NHL trade speculations. His recent lack of the lineup, courtesy of the roster management decision, has only contributed to speculation.With the long-term decisions regarding the Canucks roster pending, players are starting to come out and talk about what a possible exit of Myers would entail. The 17-year NHL veteran has been a stable figure on and off the field, and his potential departure is not only an indication of a deal but also of how the organization is headed as the NHL clock runs out.Forward Brock Boeser did not avoid the emotional burden of the situation. He called Myers a big voice within the room and one that players of a younger age always look up to. Boeser stressed that it would be hard to lose such a respected leader, but he knows the facts that are associated with the NHL trade deadline.Boeser also observed that Myers should be given a chance to compete for a Stanley Cup championship in case he is transferred.As Vancouver is a retooling process, the management might focus on acquiring future assets, and this is the recurrent theme in recent NHL news roundup discussions.Young defenseman Tom Willander had the same sentiments. The 20-year-old gave credit to Myers because he provided him with good on-ice and off-ice advice. Willander indicated that, in addition to tactical directions, Myers has made a permanent mark on the career of developing players who are attempting to take root in the NHL.Myers has played an offensive role in several seasons with Canucks, and in addition to that, he has played a considerable number of minutes in shutdown scenarios. With increasing trade talk before the NHL deadline, it is still unclear what the next step to be taken by the Canucks will be.",Tyler myers has turned into the center of persistent nhl trade speculations.

Reactions on social media platforms

The world may be on the brink of a major disruption caused by artificial intelligence, according to Dario Amodei, the chief executive officer of Anthropic, a leading AI company. In a recent interview, Amodei described the rapid evolution of AI systems as an “AI tsunami” that is approaching society faster than most people realise. He said that AI is getting closer to being able to do things that people can do faster than expected, but most of the world is still not ready for what that means. There is a lot of talk right now about how AI could change jobs, industries, the economy, and the balance of power in the world. People are paying attention to Amodei's comments because they suggest that both public knowledge and rules may not be keeping up with new technologies. The comments also show that people in the AI research community are very worried about how fast and how much innovation will change things.According to Amodei, society is at a moment where powerful AI systems are moving beyond simple tasks and are beginning to perform complex functions once thought to require deep human intelligence. In an interview on a podcast with entrepreneur Nikhil Kamath, he said the world must recognise the large-scale changes ahead, rather than dismissing them as insignificant.He used the term “tsunami” to describe AI’s rapid rise, adding that many still treat it as “just a trick of the light. ”Amodei explained that automation is already affecting technical areas such as coding, mathematics, and scientific research. He said that AI models are increasingly handling routine and specialised work previously done by humans, potentially leading to major shifts in labour markets and business models.The CEO said that the rise of advanced AI systems could have big effects on the economy and the world as a whole. He said that the spread of technology won't be limited to one industry or sector; it could also affect jobs, global markets, and competition between countries. AI investments and tools are already influencing stock prices and investor behaviour, with some financial commentators dubbing recent market reactions the “Claude Crash,” after Anthropic’s Claude models, which are competitors to other major AI systems.Amodei said that while human-centred jobs that require empathy and interpersonal skills may persist longer, roles involving repetitive or structured cognitive tasks are likely to change first. He noted that coding may be one of the earliest areas where AI takes on a significant share of the work.People on tech forums and in online communities have been talking about what Amodei said. People on Reddit agreed with some of his warnings, saying that AI could have huge effects on the economy that would affect not just tech jobs but also many other areas, including healthcare, education, and manufacturing. Some said that investors and markets are very worried because companies and workers are trying to figure out how AI will change their fields and daily operations.The comparison to a tsunami shows how quickly and on a large scale some people think AI could grow. Even though the term is a metaphor, it shows that many people and organisations may not fully understand how quickly things are changing, or the long-term consequences it could bring.","Dario amodei, ceo of leading ai company anthropic, said the world may be on the brink of a major disruption caused by artificial intelligence.

“occupy very strong positions”

“whether they act as important gateways between businesses and consumers”

“effective in addressing practices that limit competitiveness or are unfair in the cloud sector.”

Microsoft’s offices in Japan were recently raided by the country’s antitrust regulator. These raids came as part of an investigation into suspected unfair trade practices linked to the software giant’s cloud business. A Nikkei Asia report cited sources familiar with the matter to claim that the Japan Fair Trade Commission (JFTC) is examining whether Microsoft Japan improperly restricted customers of its Azure platform from using competing cloud services.The regulator is probing a potential violation of the Antimonopoly Act and is also expected to seek clarification from Microsoft’s parent company in the United States. The report cited sources to claim that Microsoft Japan is suspected of setting conditions that either made it difficult to use its software on non-Azure cloud platforms or resulted in higher fees for customers choosing alternative services.Azure competes with Amazon Web Services and Google Cloud in the global cloud market, and the raid is part of the JFTC’s efforts to ensure fair competition in the growing technology sector. According to the report, Microsoft may have relied on its market position in products such as Windows Server and Microsoft 365, with its Japan subsidiary suspected of steering customers toward Azure by limiting access to these widely used services on rival cloud platforms.Apart from Japan, regulators in Britain, Europe, and the United States have also been examining Microsoft and other companies over their cloud computing practices. Last month, Brazil’s antitrust authority opened an administrative investigation into Microsoft’s local unit in connection with its cloud services.In November 2025, the European Union opened an investigation into Amazon Web Services and Microsoft’s Azure to determine whether the two cloud platforms should be subject to rules aimed at limiting the market influence of major technology companies.The European Commission said the companiesand that it would assessunder the Digital Markets Act.The regulator also said it would examine whether the rulebook designed to address anti-competitive conduct isThe EU’s scrutiny of cloud platforms followed several industry outages that disrupted global services and raised concerns about reliance on a limited number of providers.A Microsoft spokesperson at that time said the company stands ready to contribute to the commission’s market inquiry. In contrast, a spokesperson for Amazon’s AWS unit said it is confident regulators will find that the cloud market provides choice and innovation.This came after an outage affecting Amazon’s cloud services in October 2025, which lasted around 15 hours and disrupted operations at hundreds of companies, including Apple, McDonald’s and Epic Games. Microsoft’s Azure also faced issues in October that prevented passengers from checking in for Alaska Airlines flights and interrupted voting activities in the Scottish Parliament.At that time, the European Commission said the investigation into AWS and Azure is expected to conclude within 12 months, with a final decision on the regulatory approach for the cloud sector under the Digital Markets Act likely within 18 months.",Japan fair trade commission (jftc) is examining whether microsoft japan improperly restricted customers of its azure platform from using competing cloud services.

US, China Challenge ‘Make in India’ push

India’s Solar Production Jumps After Government Support

US, China Themselves Under Scrutiny

Modi government's push for ‘ Make in India ’ is facing resistance and criticism from US and China - the two largest world economies. India is currently the world’s fifth largest economy as per IMF's World Economic Outlook from October 2025, and is on its way to become the third largest in the coming years.The move to transform India into a major global manufacturing hub faces a challenge from the US and China - both the countries have argued that India’s subsidy policies violate international trade rules.Central to the disputes is India’s production-linked incentive programme, launched by the Modi government in 2020 with the aim of strengthening domestic manufacturing. Covering 14 industries ranging from electronics and pharmaceuticals to solar equipment and medical devices, the scheme involves a total allocation of ₹1.91 trillion ($21 billion).According to a Bloomberg report, trading partners maintain that these incentives give domestic companies an edge over foreign competitors. In the solar industry, firms such as Waaree Energies Ltd., Adani Enterprises Ltd., and Reliance Industries Ltd. have gained from government backing through production-linked incentives as well as a range of non-tariff measures.On Wednesday, the United States announced preliminary tariffs of 126% on solar equipment imported from India after concluding that the industry had received unfair government support.Analysts believe these steep duties will likely make it difficult for Indian solar manufacturers to compete in the US market.The development followed a decision by the World Trade Organization’s dispute settlement body to form a panel to review China’s complaint that India’s incentive schemes for the automotive and renewable energy sectors favor domestically produced goods over imports, placing Chinese exporters at a disadvantage.The panel was constituted after initial consultations between the two sides - the first stage of the WTO dispute mechanism - did not resolve Beijing’s objections to India’s industry-specific subsidies.Officials told Bloomberg that the government intends to firmly defend its incentive schemes and maintains that they are consistent with WTO regulations.These initiatives play a key role in India’s strategy to increase manufacturing’s contribution to gross domestic product to roughly 25%, but rising objections from major trading partners could present challenges for policymakers. At present, the manufacturing sector accounts for about 17% of the economy.“Without schemes like PLI, revival of manufacturing looks difficult,” said Biswajit Dhar, a New Delhi-based independent trade economist and former professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University. At the same time, India needs to explore alternative ways to support industries, such as investing more in technology and innovation, he added.The criticism comes at a time when India is attempting to stabilize its relationships with both the United States and China. New Delhi and Washington have only recently reached an agreement that brought an end to months of trade tensions, during which India faced some of the steepest US tariffs imposed on Asian economies. At the same time, India has been working to improve ties with Beijing.The United States and China have themselves come under examination for their respective subsidy policies. In 2024, Beijing challenged aspects of the US Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, arguing that certain subsidies were tied to the use of domestically produced inputs or unfairly disadvantaged Chinese goods.Separately, European nations have accused China of relying on large-scale subsidies to accelerate the growth of its electric vehicle and solar manufacturing industries.","The push to transform india into a major global manufacturing hub faces a challenge from the us and china.
