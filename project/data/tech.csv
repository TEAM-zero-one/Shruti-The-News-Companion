How to apply for an e-passport

The age of digital travel has officially arrived in India. Now that the government is implementing chip-enabled e-passports in a few places, Indian tourists will now be able to experience improved security, quicker immigration, and worldwide compatibility. The introduction promises a safer and more intelligent method of crossing foreign borders, marking a major improvement over the conventional passport booklet. What is an e-passport, though, and is it necessary for existing passport holders to convert? Here's all that you need to know.An Indian e-passport is a modern travel document that combines the traditional paper booklet with an embedded Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) chip and antenna. The passport holder's biometric and personal data, including fingerprints and photos, are safely stored on this chip. These passports are recognised by a unique gold-colored insignia on the front cover. Processing at immigration checkpoints is made faster and more secure by the use of this technology.: Digitally signed biometric data, secured by Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), is stored on the integrated chip in e-passports.This security framework ensures the legitimacy and integrity of the data, making it difficult to fabricate or change the passport.: e-Passports enable automated and contactless verification at border controls, which will likely reduce wait times significantly and enhance the overall travel experience.: Indian e-passports, which adhere to International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) standards, will allow Indian nationals to enjoy hassle-free travel abroad, as these chip-based passports are recognised and acknowledged at immigration checkpoints in most parts of the world.: By discouraging counterfeiting and unauthorised changes, advanced security elements in e-passports shield users against fraud and identity theft.Read more: Beginner’s guide: 10 countries first-time solo travellers can visit No, holders of valid passports are not obliged to switch to electronic passports.

Currently, selected passport offices in cities such as Chennai, Hyderabad, Bhubaneswar, Surat, Nagpur, Goa, Shimla, Raipur, Amritsar, Jaipur, and Ranchi are equipped to issue e-passports.

The new chip-enabled passport will be issued to applicants throughout the application or renewal procedure if the relevant passport office is prepared to issue e-passports. In the upcoming months, a phased deployment of the government's efforts to allow all passport offices nationwide to issue e-passports is anticipated.With the launch of these passports, India moves ahead to improve national security and make foreign travel easier for its residents.The Government encourages residents to choose the new, safe, and internationally accepted travel document when they apply for or renew their passports, even if current passport holders are not required to use e-passports.","The indian government launched e-passports on april 1, 2024, in a pilot phase.

Why the Indian-origin entrepreneur was on a bus







The family and friends of Akshay Gupta, the Indian-origin entrepreneur who was stabbed by a stranger on a bus in Austin, have spoken out about Gupta's long list of achievements and his love for America. His family has revealed that his innovations got noticed by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and he was personally invited to meet him.Gupta co-founded FootBit, a startup to help the elderly live independently and safely and he even turned down a $300,000 job offer from Amazon to pursue his startup. He got an O1A visa from the US, which is only awarded to individuals with extraordinary contributions in the field of science.A 31-year-old homeless man, also from India, Deepak Kandel, stabbed Gupta in the neck on a CapMetro bus because he looked like his uncle.

He believed in where he was building it. He believed in America. America was a dreamland and he was more American than anyone,"" Jasmine said about Akshay.As the incident shocked his friends and family members to their core that a stranger could have stabbed the brightest person they knew, they revealed that Gupta recently moved to Austin from Florida and was staying with a roommate.

MrBeast’s early life and how his career started

YouTuber Jimmy Donaldson , also known as MrBeast, has reportedly joined the ranks of billionaires, with Celebrity Net Worth estimating his net worth at $1 billion. This makes the 27-year-old content creator the eighth youngest billionaire globally, and the only one under 30 who built his wealth without inheritance. MrBeast began his YouTube career as a teenager, posting videos from his North Carolina home. His initial viral success came in 2017 with ""I Counted to 100,000,"" a video that took 44 hours to film and has since accumulated over 31 million views. Since then, he has gained recognition on the platform for his challenges, large-scale giveaways, and philanthropic content.In 2024, MrBeast was identified as a leading creator on the Forbes Top Creators list. While Forbes had previously estimated his net worth at $85 million, court documents from a 2024 lawsuit related to his food brand revealed his earnings were $223 million in 2023 and were projected to reach $700 million in 2024.His business ventures include Beast Burger , a delivery-only fast-food chain launched in 2020 that reportedly earned $2.3 million per month, though he later sued due to quality concerns. MrBeast also founded Feastables , a chocolate bar company that generated over $10 million in its initial months.Additionally, he co-created Juice Funds, a $2 million initiative with Creative Juice that invests up to $250,000 in emerging creators. In the crypto and tech space, MrBeast holds Bitcoin and several CryptoPunks NFTs and is involved with platforms like Coinbase, Refinable, and the XCAD Network, which helps creators monetise videos with NFTs.His philanthropic efforts are equally extensive, as he established Beast Philanthropy, a nonprofit supporting large-scale charitable projects. MrBeast has donated over 100 cars, given away $1 million in a single video, and helped raise $20 million to plant trees through Team Trees.In 2023, he faced criticism for funding cataract surgeries for 1,000 blind individuals. In response, MrBeast reiterated his commitment, stating, “I promise to give away all my money before I die. Every single penny.”He made a similar pledge in 2019, outlining his life’s goal as ""make a bunch of money, and then give it all away while doing as much good as possible.""MrBeast's achievements have earned him various industry accolades, including a nomination for Vlogger of the Year at the Shorty Awards in 2019 and wins for Breakout Creator and 2020 YouTuber of the Year.His journey from counting to 100,000 on camera to building a multi-billion-dollar empire showcases a blend of creativity and generosity. MrBeast's career trajectory began in 2012 when, at just 13 years old, he started uploading videos under the username ""MrBeast6000.""His early content included gaming videos, often featuring Minecraft and Call of Duty, as well as videos estimating the wealth of other YouTubers. He also created reaction videos and funny compilations, showcasing his willingness to experiment with different formats.By mid-2016, his main channel on YouTube had fewer than 30,000 subscribers, but his persistence led him to drop out of college later that year to pursue YouTube full-time.His growth accelerated through diverse real-world formats, including challenges, vlogs, and absurd tasks like watching paint dry for an hour or attempting to break glass with a hundred megaphones. He gained initial popularity with his ""Worst Intros on YouTube"" series.MrBeast is known for reinvesting nearly all his video earnings back into creating new content, allowing for increasingly ambitious productions. In 2021, he was the fastest-growing creator on YouTube, adding 37 million subscribers in one year.He has also expanded his content globally by launching separate channels for dubbed videos in over 10 languages, including Spanish, French, and Arabic, leading to substantial international viewership. His main channel became the most-subscribed on YouTube in June 2024.","Jimmy donaldson, also known as mrbeast, has reportedly joined the ranks of billionaires, with celebrity net worth estimating his net worth at $1 billion.

To those also affected—you're not alone, we're at least 6,000, says Microsoft's fired AI director

Microsoft's second biggest layoffs ever hits over 6,000 employees



Microsoft announced last week that it is laying off approximately 6,000 employees, nearly 3% of its global workforce—in what marks the company's second-largest job reduction in its history. Among those affected was Gabriela de Queiroz , Director of Artificial Intelligence for Microsoft for Startups , who shared the ""bittersweet news"" of her departure on social media.""I was impacted by Microsoft's latest round of layoffs. Am I sad? Absolutely. I'm heartbroken to see so many talented people I've had the honor of working with being let go. These are people who cared deeply, went above and beyond, and truly made a difference,"" Gabriela de Queiroz wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter), alongside a picture of herself smiling.The layoffs come as Microsoft aggressively pushes into artificial intelligence, with CEO Satya Nadella revealing in April that AI now writes up to 30% of code in some Microsoft projects. Software engineers bore the brunt of the cuts, representing over 40% of the approximately 2,000 positions eliminated in Washington state alone, according to Bloomberg analysis.Despite being asked to stop work immediately and set an out-of-office message, Gabriela de Queiroz chose to stay longer. ""I chose to stay a little longer—showing up for meetings, saying goodbye, wrapping up what I could. That felt right to me,"" she explained in her social media posts.The irony of laying off an AI director while the company invests heavily in AI technology wasn't lost on industry observers. One Microsoft vice president recently told his team to use AI chatbots to generate half their computer code, up from the current 20-30%, before more than a dozen engineers on his team were subsequently laid off.""But if you know me, you know I always look at the bright side. I'm an optimist at heart. That hasn't changed. My smile, my gratitude, my belief that each day is a gift—that's all still here,"" Gabriela de Queiroz wrote, maintaining her positive outlook despite the circumstances.The cuts affect all levels, teams, and geographies as Microsoft streamlines operations and reduces management layers. ""What's next? I don't know yet. It's too soon to say. But I trust that something good will come out of this,"" Gabriela de Queiroz concluded, addressing fellow impacted employees: ""To those also affected—you're not alone. We are at least 6,000.""In another news, a Microsoft employee disrupted the company’s annual developer conference, Build 2025, in Seattle on May 19. The employee protested against the company’s Cloud and AI work with the Israeli government.Microsoft recently announced it will lay off 3% of its global workforce, affecting thousands of employees across all levels, teams, and geographies, amounting to over 6,000 employees. The cuts at the Redmond giant, which employed 228,000 people as of last June, aim to reduce management layers and streamline operations.In a related news, Microsoft's Build 2025 event faced disruption as an employee, Joe Lopez, protested against the company's contracts with the Israeli government, shouting slogans like 'Free Palestine'. This follows similar protests at Microsoft's 50th-anniversary celebrations. Lopez, a Microsoft Azure veteran, claims the company's technology aids in harming Palestinian civilians, a claim Microsoft denies.According to reports, the protesting employee was also joined by a fired Google employee who was part of last year’s sit-in protests against Google’s cloud contract with Israel. The disruptions appear to have been organised by the group 'No Azure for Apartheid'.","Microsoft layoffs 2025 hit 6,000 employees worldwide, including ai director gabriela de queiroz.

Indian-American Vaibhav Taneja , Tesla’s Chief Financial Officer (CFO), has garnered significant media attention for his extraordinary compensation package. In 2024, Taneja earned a staggering $139 million (approximately Rs 1,195.4 crore), surpassing top tech CEOs such as Satya Nadella of Microsoft, Sundar Pichai of Google, and Mark Zuckerberg of Meta. His pay package, which places him among the highest-paid finance executives in history, includes substantial stock options and equity grants granted after his promotion as CFO in 2023. Taneja's remarkable earnings reflect his pivotal role at Tesla, especially during a challenging period for the company.Vaibhav Taneja's overall compensation for 2024 is the highest among CFOs worldwide, according to reports. This compensation package not only eclipsed Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and Google CEO Sundar Pichai but also broke the previous quarterly CFO compensation record of $86 million by Nikola's previous CFO in 2020. Much of Taneja's compensation package is made up of stock options and equity grants, which were issued upon his promotion as CFO in August 2023. While his base pay was $400,000 (Rs 3.44 crore roughly), most of his compensation was performance-based to shares, aligning his fiscal interests with Tesla's long-term success.Taneja's compensation package places him far above his colleagues in the tech industry. For instance, Satya Nadella took home a total salary package of $79.1 million (approximately Rs 680 crore) in 2024, and Sundar Pichai took home $10.7 million (approximately Rs 92 crore). Taneja's compensation is orders of magnitude higher than that, an indicator of his business-critical significance at Tesla during a challenging period for the company.Vaibhav Taneja kick-started his career in business in India with a Bachelor of Commerce degree from Delhi University in 1999. He then went on to become a Chartered Accountant (CA) from the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) in 2000. In 2006, he also became the illustrious Certified Public Accountant (CPA) of the United States, once again establishing himself as an accounting and finance expert.Taneja spent close to 17 years in PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) and bridged both India and the United States. He acquired valuable experience in auditing, regulation compliance, and financial services during his time working for PwC, which laid a solid foundation for his subsequent career in the corporate sector.In 2016, Taneja broke into the industry when he joined SolarCity, a solar energy firm that later merged with Tesla. This was the start of his association with Elon Musk's electric car firm. After Tesla acquired SolarCity in 2017, Taneja became Assistant Corporate Controller. He advanced within the company and was later appointed Corporate Controller in 2018 and Chief Accounting Officer in 2019.In August 2023, Taneja was promoted to Chief Financial Officer, succeeding Zach Kirkhorn. Taneja, in his position as Chief Financial Officer, manages the finances of Tesla and is also a senior member of the company's strategic decision-making groups.Besides his international roles, Vaibhav Taneja serves as a director at Tesla India Motors and Energy Private Limited. In this role, Taneja has a key responsibility of charting the expansion of Tesla in India, a country with immense potential for the growth of electric vehicles (EVs). His contribution to Tesla's efforts to enter the Indian market is significant since the company is trying to build a bigger presence in one of the world's fastest-growing car markets.Although Taneja's pay is certainly generous, it is occurring at a tough time for Tesla. The firm has several concerns that it has to address, such as declining profit margins, enhanced competition in the EV space, and declining vehicle deliveries. In the first quarter of 2025, Tesla posted a decline of 13% in worldwide deliveries and its net profit fell by 71%, its first annual decline in deliveries in more than a decade. Despite all these challenges, Taneja's leadership and vision of guidance are considered essential in steering through these rough waters.Vaibhav Taneja an Indian-origin executive and Tesla’s Chief Financial Officer net worth in 2025, received a jaw-dropping paycheck worth $139 million in 2024. His financial success is driven by his experience at Tesla and the extremely valuable stock options he has accumulated over the years. His better returns reflect his top-level financial expertise and his skill level in a complex finance environment, both in his present role at Tesla and overall.Vaibhav Taneja's ascension to the position of prominence as Tesla's CFO is an inspirational rags-to-riches story, one that encapsulates the colossal benefits of leadership positions in corporate life. With more than two decades as part of a shining career marked by turning points at PwC, SolarCity, and Tesla, Taneja has emerged as one of the most distinguished finance executives of today. His record-breaking compensation package, along with his visionary role in Tesla's international expansion, cements his reputation as a powerful player in the electric vehicle and corporate finance circles. As Tesla battles on in the crowded EV market, Taneja's leadership and experience will be a deciding element in the company's ongoing success.","Indian-american vaibhav taneja is tesla's chief financial officer (cfo) in 2024, he earned a staggering $139 million (approximately rs 1,195.4 crore) this compensation package not only eclipsed microsoft ceo satya nadella and google ceo sundar pichai but also broke the previous quarterly cfo compensation record of $86 million.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121335626,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-12484,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Xbox and PlayStation Price Hikes Explained

Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently highlighted a cost-cutting measure that suggests that the US federal government may be wasting about $100 million annually on inactive phone lines. Musk quoted a post by DOGE aka the Department of Government Efficiency which revealed that nearly 20% of the phone lines at a federal agency were unused. DOGE shared a post on X that reads “Unused phone lines! Of the 1048 @USOPM phone lines, 198 (19%) were either unused or duplicated.”It further added: “OPM (Office of Personnel Management) cancelled these lines (took 1 hour), resulting in ~$100k/yr in savings. Since OPM is ~0.1% of the federal government, this suggests that ~$100M/yr is wasted on unused lines”.The tech billionaire responded to the post, statingThe revelation could have broader implications for telecom providers supplying services to federal agencies. According to a 2023 Washington Post report, only 2% of U.S. adults use landlines exclusively. As legacy landline usage continues to decline—the cost and necessity of maintaining unused infrastructure is under increasing scrutiny.In 2019, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) repealed regulations that had previously required telecom providers to run copper landline connections to every home. The move marked a significant shift toward modernizing telecommunications infrastructure in favor of wireless and fiber-optic networks.According to a report, Verizon Communications Inc. remains the dominant landline service provider in the Northeastern United States, maintaining a strong regional presence even as overall landline use continues to decline nationwide.",Tesla ceo elon musk highlighted a cost-cutting measure that suggests that the us federal government may be wasting about $100 million annually on inactive phone lines.

Indigenous Amazon tribe says New York Times story led to its members being smeared as porn addicts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indigenous-amazon-tribe-says-new-york-times-story-led-to-its-members-being-smeared-as-porn-addicts/articleshow/121349433.cms,"Representative Image (AP)





LOS ANGELES: An Indigenous tribe from the Brazilian Amazon has sued The New York Times, saying the newspaper's reporting on the tribe's first exposure to the internet led to its members being widely portrayed as technology-addled and addicted to pornography.The Marubo Tribe of the Javari Valley, a sovereign community of about 2,000 people in the rainforest, filed the defamation lawsuit seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages this week in a court in Los Angeles.It also names TMZ and Yahoo as defendants, alleging that their stories amplified and sensationalized the Times' reporting and smeared the tribe in the process.The suit says the Times' June 2024 story by reporter Jack Nicas on how the group was handling the introduction of satellite service through Elon Musk's Starlink ""portrayed the Marubo people as a community unable to handle basic exposure to the internet, highlighting allegations that their youth had become consumed by pornography.""""These statements were not only inflammatory but conveyed to the average reader that the Marubo people had descended into moral and social decline as a direct result of internet access,"" an amended version of the lawsuit filed Thursday says. ""Such portrayals go far beyond cultural commentary; they directly attack the character, morality, and social standing of an entire people, suggesting they lack the discipline or values to function in the modern world.In a statement to The Associated Press, a Times spokesperson said: ""Any fair reading of this piece shows a sensitive and nuanced exploration of the benefits and complications of new technology in a remote Indigenous village with a proud history and preserved culture. We intend to vigorously defend against the lawsuit.""The theme of Nicas' story was that after less than a year of service, the community was now facing the same kinds of struggles with the pervasive effects of the internet and the proliferation of smartphones that much of the world has dealt with for years.Nicas listed a broad range of those challenges: ""teenagers glued to phones; group chats full of gossip; addictive social networks; online strangers; violent video games; scams; misinformation; and minors watching pornography.""He later wrote that a tribal leader ""is most unsettled by the pornography. He said young men were sharing explicit videos in group chats, a stunning development for a culture that frowns on kissing in public.""The piece makes no other mention of porn, but that aspect of the story was amplified and aggregated by other outlets including TMZ, which ran a story and accompanying video headlined, ""Elon Musk's Starlink Hookup Leaves A Remote Tribe Addicted To Porn.""The suit says the video segment ""falsely framed the Marubo Tribe as having descended into moral collapse.""Messages seeking comment from TMZ and Yahoo were not immediately answered.The misperceptions brought on by the aggregation and repackaging of the story led the Times to publish a follow-up.""The Marubo people are not addicted to pornography,"" Nicas wrote in the the second story. ""There was no hint of this in the forest, and there was no suggestion of it in The New York Times's article.""That did not satisfy the tribe, which says in the lawsuit that it ""failed to acknowledge the role the NYT itself played in fueling the defamatory narrative. Rather than issuing a retraction or apology, the follow-up downplayed the original article's emphasis on pornography by shifting blame to third-party aggregators.""Nicas wrote that he spent a week with the Marubo tribe. The lawsuit says that while he was invited for a week, he spent less than 48 hours in the village, ""barely enough time to observe, understand, or respectfully engage with the community.The lawsuit was first reported by Courthouse News.The plaintiffs also include community leader Enoque Marubo and Brazilian journalist and sociologist Flora Dutra, both of whom appeared in the story.Both were instrumental in bringing the tribe the internet connection, which they said has had many positive effects including facilitating emergency medicine and the education of children.They cited the TMZ video, which shows them setting up antennas for the connection, as creating the ""unmistakable impression"" that the two ""had introduced harmful, sexually explicit material into the community and facilitated the alleged moral and social decay.""The lawsuit seeks at least $180 million, including both general and punitive damages, from each of the defendants.""The fallout from the publication was not limited to public perception,"" the suit says, ""it destroyed lives, institutions, and culturally significant projects.""","The marubo tribe of the javari valley, a sovereign community of about 2,000 people in the rainforest, filed the defamation lawsuit this week.

Is this plan a good idea?

But the plan is also drawing criticism.

The pros and cons of cheaper electricity

Will Brussels thwart Berlin's plan?

'Tailored measures' make more sense





Ahead of February's general election in Germany, the country's industry leaders raised the alarm. They urged the new German government to do something against high electricity prices and warned of business closures and companies relocating abroad if nothing happened.Their concerns appear to have resonated with the new coalition government of the conservative CDU/CSU party alliance and the Social Democrats (SPD) headed by Chancellor Friedrich Merz.After only a few weeks in office, it is planning significant relief measures, but some experts are warning of potential downsides.How high are electricity prices for German industry?It's hard to pinpoint a single figure, as existing relief from electricity costs varies depending on company size and sector.According to a study by the Bavarian Business Association (vbw) based in Munich, Germany's industrial electricity prices were around the European average in 2022. However, the impact of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 affected energy markets, making year-to-year comparisons difficult.Recent EU data shows that Germany ranks third in the bloc regarding electricity prices for non-household consumers — a category that includes not only industries but also public institutions like schools and government offices, thus making it hard to draw conclusions about the impact on industry specifically.When it comes to the wholesale electricity price — before taxes and fees — Germany is in the middle of international comparisons, said Bruno Burger, energy expert at the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems, while speaking to the German daily Frankfurter Rundschau recently.Germany's plan to keep up with US and ChinaOne thing is clear, though, companies in the US and China pay significantly less.In 2023, industrial electricity prices were around 7 euro cents (around 8 cents) per kilowatt-hour in the US, according to the German ifo Institute think tank, and about 8 cents in China, vbw data show. In Germany, however, industrial firms pay around 20 cents, ifo says.Plans by the coalition government in Berlin reportedly include broad-based relief measures to reduce industrial electricity prices.In Germany, the electricity price is made up of the wholesale price, plus an electricity tax, surcharges, and grid fees. Grid fees are charges for using the power network, while surcharges fund specific government initiatives.Berlin is now planning to reduce the electricity price by 5 cents per kilowatt-hour for businesses by lowering the electricity tax to the EU minimum and cutting surcharges and grid fees.The government also wants to extend and expand the electricity price compensation program, which reimburses energy-intensive industries for costs arising from CO2 pricing. The CO2 price is applied to the use of fossil fuels in Germany and the EU to discourage emissions.Andreas Fischer, energy and climate policy expert at the Cologne-based German Economic Institute (IW), told DW that ""from the consumer's perspective, the broad-based relief is positive.""Max Jankowsky, CEO of Lössnitz Foundry and president of the Chemnitz Chamber of Industry and Commerce, agrees, telling DW in a statement that the urgency of reducing electricity prices for industry has been ""recognized.""""A blanket reduction in electricity prices contradicts the needs of a system based on renewable energy,"" says Swantje Fiedler, scientific director at the Forum for Ecological-Social Market Economy. Rather, the German energy system would need incentives for energy storage and flexibility, she told DW, because renewable electricity supply is bound to fluctuate, with abundant supply in summer and scarce in winter.“At the same time, it is important to consider how flexible a company can be,” says IW expert Fischer, as not all firms could quickly adapt to changes in electricity supply or pricing.Leonhard Probst, from the Germany-based Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems in Freiburg, believes lower electricity prices may reduce incentives for companies to use electricity more efficiently.Probst, who manages the Energy-Charts.de platform — the most comprehensive database for power generation in Germany — also said that, on the other hand, cheaper electricity can make it easier to electrify industrial processes, which is better for the environment in the long run.The Lössnitz Foundry would be such a case in point, as the company's CEO Max Jankowsky has been planning to switch from coke to an electric smelting furnace. So far, however, high power prices are holding him back: ""It feels like running into a buzzsaw,"" he said, referring to the risk of permanently high electricity prices.The coalition agreement of Germany's ruling parties also mentions further relief for energy-intensive companies. It remains unclear whether this includes capping the wholesale electricity price, though some experts believe that's the intent.As shown in price breakdowns, taxes and surcharges already account for only a small portion of the final electricity cost.Fraunhofer scientist Probst warns that artificially lowering prices could backfire: ""If electricity is in short supply but sold cheaply, scarcity intensifies and prices rise further,"" he argued.Sebastian Bolay, head of energy, environment and industry at the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce (DIHK), sees another problem looming for the government on the horizon.""A price cap would interfere with market pricing and would likely not be permissible under EU state aid rules,"" Bolay told DW.Moreover, a price cap could also be expensive for taxpayers, Probst added, as many companies that don't need relief, because energy costs make up only a small part of their value creation, would ""benefit unnecessarily.""Swantje Fiedler is convinced that a faster rollout of renewable energy in Germany will ""lower prices in the long term.""In the meantime, said Probst, ""targeted subsidies"" are more effective than blanket price reductions, and could include special electricity rates for the use of heat pumps.Jankowsky is also calling for what he called ""tailored measures,"" especially to help small and medium-sized businesses (SME's), noting that many existing subsidies don't apply to them, which must be changed, ""and it needs to happen fast.""",German industry leaders urged the new government to do something against high electricity prices. Industry leaders warned of business closures and companies relocating abroad if nothing happened.

French lawmakers move to stop annoying telemarketer calls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/french-lawmakers-move-to-stop-annoying-telemarketer-calls/articleshow/121322322.cms,"Representative AI image





The French parliament moved Wednesday to stop telemarketers making annoying, unsolicited phone calls, with measures due to come into force in just over a year.Under the legislation, passed in a senate vote, it will be up to a company to prove that a call made on their behalf to an individual's telephone was done so with the person's express consent.The only exception would be when the company is calling to carry out an already-agreed contract.According to an October 2024 survey by French consumer group UFC-Que Choisir, 97 percent of people in France have expressed irritation at the cold calls.Often the telemarketers use different phone numbers from different geographic areas as a tactic to place the calls about heat pumps, changing utility or cell phone providers, installing windows, or other transactions.The lawmakers, backed by the government, decided to erect a law against the cold-callers after seeing that a French service, Bloctel, meant to prevent such spam calls, was not working.One Frenchwoman, Lucie Kapfer, 43, said she got rid of her landline after receiving ""several calls each week"" from unwanted telemarketers.""But they continued on my mobile phone. Several calls a day, it was sheer hell,"" she said.The French government was also concerned by how many of the calls were about arranging fraudulent access to publicly funded schemes, such as training programmes or subsidies for making homes more energy efficient.The law will protect ""the more vulnerable people, the elderly, those who sometimes don't realise that this harassment by telephone is only an entry point to massive fraud schemes"", said the minister for public accounts, Amelie de Montchalin.The law is scheduled to come into effect in August 2026.Companies ""will have a year to organise themselves"" to comply with the law, but after that ""there will be no exceptions,"" said the senator Pierre-Jean Verzelen, who promoted the measure.Spain, too, is looking at taking action against telemarketers. Its government last week said it wants telecom operators to block calls from firms not using a dedicated prefix identifying them as commercial callers.","French parliament moves to stop telemarketers making annoying, unsolicited phone calls. 97 percent of people in france have expressed irritation at the cold calls.

Coconut oil on the boil: Price hikes pinch users,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/coconut-oil-on-the-boil-price-hikes-pinch-users/articleshow/121350178.cms,"MUMBAI: The humble coconut oil-a must-have product in almost every Indian household-may be the reason your grocery bills pinched you a bit more. Companies like Marico and Dabur collectively took close to 40% price hikes in coconut oil over the past 12 months due to high inflation in the category.Prices of commodities have more or less 'peaked', and any major price increases are unlikely to be passed on to consumers unless there's a 'black swan event', said Saugata Gupta, MD & CEO at Marico, who is betting on better volume growth for the FMCG sector this financial year. For Marico, which makes Parachute coconut oil, copra (from which coconut oil is derived) makes up a large share of its commodity basket. Copra prices soared by 40%-50% over the past year, pushing Marico to take nearly 30% price increases over the past 12 months, Gupta told TOI. Marico leads the coconut oil market with more than a 50% share, according to market estimates. Firms with a bigger play, like Marico, use copra to derive coconut oil, while some buy the oil directly from the market.Dabur took around a 10% price hike in the category in the past three to six months, stockist sources said. ""We mitigated the impact of inflation through a mix of value engineering, cost-saving initiatives, and judicious price increases, keeping the competitive intensity in mind,"" said Ankush Jain, CFO at Dabur India.Coconut oil is on the boil globally, with prices hitting a record high. Earlier this month, the benchmark wholesale price for Filipino coconut oil delivered in Rotterdam rose above $2,700 a metric ton, about 200% higher than the 2000-2020 average, Bloomberg reported. Bad weather hit coconut production in Southeast Asia.The local consumer goods industry is contending with high input cost inflation in a few other commodities, such as cocoa and edible oils, as well. Crude, though, has been soft, giving some relief to firms. FMCG companies have also been struggling with a demand slowdown led by weak urban consumption, which firms hope will see revival going ahead, helped by easing food inflation.The biggest player, Hindustan Unilever (HUL), expects the first half of FY26 to be better than the second half of FY25. Marico's Gupta said that the industry will see better volume growth this FY. ""Urban demand didn't deteriorate further. It's subdued but not stressful,"" Gupta said, adding that companies will have to continue premiumising to sustain growth even in a sluggish environment. ""The extra disposable income that consumers will get through the tax breaks will be spent on upgrading and discretionary, not necessarily only staples,"" said Gupta.","Coconut oil is on the boil globally, with prices hitting a record high.

NEW DELHI: Gross foreign direct investment (FDI) into India rose 13.6% to $81 billion during the last financial year, the fastest pace of expansion since 2019-20.The increase in the year was despite a contraction seen during the fourth quarter of 2024-25 when inflows on a gross basis declined 6% to $17.9 billion, probably due to the uncertainty caused by Donald Trump's election and his assertions around getting investments back into the US.On net basis, however, FDI declined 97% to $353 million due to large scale repatriation out of the country, driven to an extent by overseas investors such as Hyundai cashing out through initial public offers.Latest data released by RBI pegged repatriation and disinvestment of stake in India at Rs $51.5 billion in 2024-25, 16% higher than the previous year. As a result, FDI into India was estimated at $29.5 billion.After you factor in FDI by India - which shot up 75% to $29.2 billion - net inflows barely remained in the positive zone. During the last fiscal year, Indian companies invested $17 billion in equity capital overseas, which was 87% higher than the previous year.""FDI inflows into India have shown a healthy trend, but with more India companies showing global investment appetite, net inflows have been impacted,"" a top policymaker said.Govt has been trying to push FDI into the country as it seeks to tap into growing appetite among global investors to diversify beyond China. But, by all accounts companies have opted to invest in Vietnam and Mexico and the task has become more difficult with Trump pushing companies, including the likes of Apple, to invest in the US.Global agencies as well as domestic economists have called for govt to push a fresh set of reforms, including notification of the labour codes and making it easier for companies to acquire land.",Gross foreign direct investment (fdi) into india rose 13.6% to $81 billion during the last financial year.

De Beers working with govt for zero-tariff in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/de-beers-working-with-govt-for-zero-tariff-in-us/articleshow/121350228.cms,"MUMBAI: De Beers Group is collaborating with the Indian govt to establish a policy of zero tariff for diamonds entering the US after being cut and polished in India. The group has also met with Piyush Goyal, minister of commerce and industry, requesting him to engage with his US counterpart for the ""free flow of diamonds"".Al Cook, CEO of De Beers Group, stated that 90% of diamonds are exported from India, making it crucial for the country to secure a deal before July 9. ""Britain and India seem to be doing very good jobs on working with tariff deals with the US. I am very confident that India will reach a deal ahead of July 9. We have already seen a deal in the UK,"" he said.Cook added that beyond India and the US, the world allows the ""free flow of natural diamonds"" as there are only a few places around the world, mainly in Africa, where they are produced. Since diamonds are mined in the US and cut and polished mostly in India, a zero-duty entry of diamonds into the US will not lead to any job losses, he reasoned. ""We don't think there should be a tax on love,"" the De Beers CEO remarked. Discussing shifting trends, he noted that until a few years ago, it was about diamonds 'from India' and 'by India,' but now it is 'for India' and 'to India. ' He was hinting at the increasing domestic demand for diamonds in the second largest market in the world.The diamond conglomerate forecasts that India's natural diamond consumption market is likely to double in the coming five years, from about $9-10 billion to about $18-20 billion. Speaking about the bifurcation of the market into natural and lab-grown diamonds (LGD), he mentioned that as LGD wholesale value has fallen to below $60 per carat, the significance of technology-enabled diamond testing has grown in importance.","De beers group is collaborating with the indian govt to establish a policy of zero tariff for diamonds entering the us.
