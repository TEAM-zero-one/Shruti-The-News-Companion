ISRO Makes History As ‘Bahubali’ Rocket Places India’s Heaviest Communication Satellite In Orbit

CHENNAI/BENGALURU: Isro Sunday launched the 4,410kg CMS-03 or the Gsat-7R, a communication satellite that will enhance telecommunication coverage across the strategic Indian Ocean Region (IOR) for the Indian Navy.The launch of the heaviest communication satellite from Indian soil onboard LVM3-M5 from the second launch pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, marked the fifth operational flight of LVM3. The mission also saw a new in-orbit experiment - a successful re-ignition of the cryogenic upper stage.About 16 minutes after lift-off, LVM-3 placed Gsat-7R into a sub-Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (sub-GTO) with a perigee (farthest point from Earth) of only 26,700km.Gsat-7R is designed to replace Gsat-7 (Rukmini), which was launched in 2013 and is primarily dedicated to Indian Navy, while Isro had launched another satellite from the same family - Gsat-7A - for the Indian Air Force.As per the Navy, Gsat-7R includes many indigenous state-of-the-art components developed specifically to meet its operational requirements. The Navy said that in an era of complex security challenges, the satellite represents its determination to protect the nation's maritime interests, leveraging advanced technology through self-reliance.""Gsat-7Rwill provide robust telecommunication coverage across IOR. Its payload includes transponders capable of supporting voice, data, and video links over multiple communication bands. This satellite will significantly enhance connectivity with high-capacity bandwidth, enabling seamless and secure communication links between ships, aircraft, submarines, and Maritime Operations Centres,"" the Navy stated.UR Rao Satellite Centre director M Sankaran said the satellite carries advanced payloads in multiple frequency bands - UHF, S-band, C-band and Ku-band - and includes several indigenous technologies such as a 1,200-litre propulsion tank and collapsible antenna systems. ""All systems are functioning normally. The satellite is healthy, and all isolation valves have opened as expected,"" Sankaran said.As per Isro's own description of LVM-3, its capacity to GTO (around 36,000km perigee) is only 4,000 tonnes. Until Sunday, all satellites Isro put into GTO using an LVM-3 have weighed under 4,000kg -anything heavier than that has been launched using foreign launch vehicles.Isro chairman V Narayanan said: ""...The vehicle performance was enhanced to increase its payload capacity by 10%. The satellite has a life of 15 years and carries a host of new technologies. We accomplished this mission despite difficult weather conditions.""","Gsat-7r is designed to replace gsat-7 (rukmini), which was launched in 2013.

The Indian Space Research Organisation ISRO ) on Sunday successfully launched CMS-03, the heaviest communication satellite to be launched from India, onboard its LVM3-M5 (GSLV-MkIII) heavy-lift rocket from the Second Launch Pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre , Sriharikota. The mission marks the fifth operational flight of the LVM3 vehicle. The previous mission using the rocket was Chandrayaan-3 on July 14, 2023.Around 16minutes after liftoff, the rocket with a total lift off mass of 642 tonnes and a height of 43.5 metres, placed the 4410-kg CMS-03 satellite into a Geo-synchronous Transfer Orbit (GTO).The mission’s flight sequence began with the ignition of both S200 boosters at lift-off, followed by their separation at around 131.14 seconds when the vehicle reached an altitude of 62.3 km. The L110 stage ignited at 106.94 seconds and separated at 304.70 seconds, at an altitude of 166.9 km. The C25 cryogenic stage ignited at 307.10 seconds and continued its burn until 950.94 seconds, achieving an inertial velocity of 10.14 km/s. The CMS-03 satellite separated from the launch vehicle at 965.94 seconds at an altitude of 179.8 km, completing its insertion into the targeted orbit.PM Modi congratulated Isro and wrote on social media platform X, ""Our space sector continues to make us proud! Congratulations ISRO on the successful launch of India’s heaviest communication satellite, CMS-03.Powered by our space scientists, it is commendable how our space sector has become synonymous with excellence and innovation. Their successes have furthered national progress and empowered countless lives. ""The LVM3-M5 vehicle, which has seven consecutive successful missions, consisted of two solid strap-on boosters (S200), a liquid core stage (L110), and a cryogenic upper stage (C25), all housed within a 5-metre diameter Ogive Payload Fairing. Each S200 motor carried 204.5 tonnes of Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene (HTPB)-based solid propellant, while the L110 core contained 115.9 tonnes of UH25 and N2O4 liquid propellants. The C25 cryogenic stage was loaded with 28.6 tonnes of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen.On the occasion, Isro chairman V Narayanan said, ""LVM3-M5 successfully injected into the required orbit precisely. This is the 8th consecutive successful launch by LVM3. CMS-03 is the heaviest satellite placed in GTO orbit. The vehicle performance was enhanced to increase its payload capacity by 10%.""""The satellite has a life of 15 years and carries a host of new technologies. We accomplished this mission despite the difficult weather condition. The launch also had the reignition of C20 cryogenic engine for the first time after placing the satellite. This will help in placing satellites in multiple orbits using LVM3"", he further added.CMS-03 is a multi-band communication satellite designed to provide services over a wide oceanic region, including the Indian landmass.Narayanan said there will be seven more launches in this financial year. This includes the LVM3-M6 launching a customer satellite in the second week of December; PSLV-C62 launch and SSLV-L1 launch, placing customer satellites; PSLV technology demonstration of 34 new technologies, and the first uncrewed mission of Gaganyaan.The satellite will be used for civilian and strategic purposes.","Lvm3-m5 mission successfully launches cms-03 satellite into a geo-synchronous transfer orbit.

Rare earth nod comes with no-export rider





NEW DELHI: Govt on Thursday announced ""some Indian companies"" have got approval from China to import rare earth magnets, to be used in automotive and electronics industries.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said licenses have been issued, which will enable access to the magnets whose procurement had been stopped after China put curbs on their sale earlier this year.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal on Thursday confirmed that some Indian companies have received licences for importing rare earth magnets from China, while responding to questions on the matter.""As far as the question of the latest talks and relaxations that have happened between the US and China (and) as to how it is going to play into our domain, I will come back to you. We have yet to look at it. I am not aware of the technicalities... But I do confirm that Indian companies have received licenses for importing rare earths from China,"" he said.Jaiswal, however, did not give details of the companies that have received permission. Industry sources said the companies include those that supply components to the automotive and electronics industries.However, the imports come with certain restrictions. These include conditions that the magnets cannot be exported to the US, and cannot be used for defence-related industries.The curbs have impacted the production of automobiles, especially electric cars and two-wheelers with companies petitioning govt to take up the matter with China.Rare earth magnets are the strongest type of permanent magnets commercially available. Their high magnetic strength and resistance to demagnetisation make them indispensable in a range of applications, especially where weight and space are constraints.According to experts, these magnets are made primarily from rare earth elements like neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium - materials that allow for powerful magnetic properties essential in miniaturised and energy-efficient devices. They are typically made from alloys that contain rare earth elements. The most commonly used rare earth magnet is the neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnet.China is estimated to account for about 70% of global rare earth metals mining and holds nearly 90% of the world's rare earth magnet's production. One of the biggest reasons that China dominates the rare earth magnet industry is its control over the entire supply chain, including mining of rare earth ores, separation and refining of rare earth elements (a complex and environmentally sensitive process), and alloy production and magnet manufacturing.Just in the Indian auto industry alone, about 870 tonnes of rare-earth magnets are required to be imported in FY 2025-26 out of the country's estimated overall requirement of 3,600 tonnes.","Mea spokesperson randhir jaiswal said licenses have been issued, which will enable access to the magnets.

Travis Kelce’s ex-girlfriend, Kayla Nicole, turned heads on Halloween with an Instagram post that many fans interpreted as a subtle dig at the Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce and his fiancée, Taylor Swift . Nicole dressed as singer Toni Braxton, recreating the music video for Braxton’s hit, “He Wasn’t Man Enough”. In the video, she danced and lip-synced the lyrics:“Do you know I dumped your husband, girlfriend? … Do you know he begged to stay with me? He wasn’t man enough for me. ” The timing and content of the post quickly sparked speculation that it was aimed at Kelce and Swift, who got engaged in August after more than two years of dating.The post drew attention not just from fans, but from notable figures in sports and entertainment.

PewDiePie’s honest opinion about AI use











PewDiePieYouTube star Felix “PewDiePie” Kjellberg has surprised fans again, this time with a big tech project at home. Living in Japan with his wife and son, Felix now spends more time on hobbies he loves. On October 31, 2025, he posted a video called “STOP. Using AI Right now.” In it, he showed his powerful new computer setup, worth around $20,000, built with several RTX 4090 GPUs.He said he first wanted to use this machine to help with cancer research using a project called Folding@home, where people share their computer power with scientists. But soon, he began using the same system to explore AI. This made fans wonder if PewDiePie had built his own artificial intelligence.Felix explained that he didn’t create a new AI from scratch. Instead, he used his computer to self-host existing open-source AI models. He ran OpenAI’s open-source GPT-OSS 120B model, which means it has 120 billion parameters.Later, he tried another model called Qwen 2.5 3B, which needed even stronger hardware. PewDiePie said it felt “exactly like ChatGPT, but much faster.”His goal was not to invent something new but to learn how AI systems work locally and to keep his data private.He said he doesn’t want to depend on big companies like OpenAI or Google.As per Wccftech (Nov 2025), his PC can also help scientists when idle, a mix of tech passion and good cause.Even though Felix likes learning about AI, he doesn’t like how it’s taking over everything online. In the same video, he said he dislikes AI art and AI video tools because he wants to protect real artists.“I don’t mess with image generation or video generation. I stand with the drawing nerds,” he said around 6:40 minutes.Also Read: Sneako Calls Out Erika Kirk For Her Viral Hug With JD Vance And Her Bold Charlie Kirk Comparison He also said seeing AI everywhere “feels annoying” and called some YouTube AI tools “useless.” Still, he added that people who hate AI are “equally bad,” giving the example of Markiplier, who got backlash for using AI in his clothing brand Cloak.Fans online praised his honesty and said PewDiePie “already won at life.”","Youtube star felix “pewdiepie” kjellberg has surprised fans again, this time with a big tech project at home.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says that the company’s latest round of layoffs that impacted barely 14,000 people is not because of money or AI. Instead, the real reason behind Amazon job cuts is the culture, Jassy said. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” he said as quoted by Business Insider. “It really — it's culture.”“And if you grow as fast as we did for several years, the size of businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers,” Jassy explained.“And when that happens, Sometimes, without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work,” he added. “And it can lead to slowing you down.”In a blog post dated October 28, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti announced that the e-commerce company is “making organizational changes across Amazon that will impact some of our teammates.”“While this will include reducing in some areas and hiring in others, it will mean an overall reduction in our corporate workforce of approximately 14,000 roles,” she said.Amazon’s latest job cuts is the company’s biggest layoff since 2022 when the company laid off 27,000 positions. Jassy’s remarks contradict what Amazon executive has been saying about the job cuts.In the blog post, Beth Galetti explained “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.”Separately, Tapas Roy, vice president of device software and services sent a company-wide email this week saying the company is cutting roles within its OS & Services team and asked remaining workers to ""lean in on AI.""","Amazon ceo andy jassy says that the company’s latest round of layoffs that impacted barely 14,000 people is not because of money or ai. “the announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really ai-driven, not right now at least,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124986273,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-17580,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

YouTube TV subscribers woke up to a blackout of Disney-owned channels including ESPN, ABC, FX and National Geographic after the contract negotiations between Google and Disney failed to reach a new agreement before the deadline of October 30. The blackout of Disney channels on YouTube TV started around midnight ET on October 31, when the previous deal expired. Earlier this week, Disney also warned its subscribers about the potential disruption citing stalled negotiations over pricing. YouTube TV, which charges $82.99/month, said it was unwilling to accept Disney’s proposed rate hikes, calling them unfair to customers.The timing for the blackout of Disney channels couldn’t be worst as it affects the access to college football, NFL, NBA, and NHL games broadcast on ESPN and ABC. Viewers in Florida, for example, will miss the highly anticipated Florida–Georgia rivalry game this Saturday. Disney’s sports networks including ACC Network and SEC Network are also unavailable, leaving fans without coverage of major playoff events and seasonal matchups.The blackout impacts more than 20 channels, including:In addition to live broadcasts, recorded content from Disney networks has also been removed from YouTube TV’s cloud DVR service.Speaking about the issue, YouTube TV issued an official statement saying, “This decision directly harms our subscribers while benefiting their own live TV products, including Hulu + Live TV and Fubo”.

Apple reported a surprise fall in sales in China. However, much to investors and the company's relief, the fall has not been due to the decline in demand. Apple reportedly blamed the surprise decline in China revenue on supply disruptions. According to a report in Bloomberg, Apple has predicted that the company will return to growth in the world’s biggest smartphone arena as the iPhone 17 gains momentum. Apple CEO Tim Cook said at the earnings call, “It was basically supply constraints that drove the results.” Cook added, “We’re thrilled with what we’re seeing right now.”Apple CEO said that Apple’s store traffic is up significantly in China, and that the latest iPhones -- iPhone 17 series -- has been well received. Cook also said that Apple reached a new high for September-quarter revenue from services in China, while reiterating that the iPhone is doing very well.According to the report, China was a prominent topic during the earning conference, with analysts asking about the region multiple times. The threat of higher tariffs has disrupted global tech supply chain that’s already in flux because of longer-term decisions to diversify away from China.Apple’s total growth projection for the December quarter is between 10% and 12%. Cook, however, didn't specify how much China would contribute to that.Apple has seen stiffer competition from local brands in China. Reports suggest that Huawei Technologies took the top spot in June, as its campaign to reclaim a bigger share of the premium tier resonated with Chinese consumers. Xiaomi too is reported to have made a splash with its Xiaomi 17 series.IDC estimates that 58.6 million iPhones were sold worldwide in the July-September quarter, putting Apple second behind Samsung at 61.4 million of their Android-powered phones sold worldwide in the quarter.In a conference call with analysts, Tim Cook indicated his belief that the iPhone 17 lineup will continue to do well, predicting even more of the devices will be sold during the final three months of the year. “As we head into the holiday season with our most powerful lineup ever, I couldn’t be more excited for what’s to come,” Cook said. Apple expects its iPhone sales to increase at least 10% from last year's holiday season, according to projections provided by Apple's chief financial officer, Kevan Parekh. Total revenue is expected to rise at a similar rate.","Apple reported a surprise fall in sales in china.

In a major push to consolidate its presence in the Indian market, OpenAI has announced that it will offer ChatGPT Go free to all users in India starting November 4. For the uninitiated, ChatGPT Go is OpenAI's mid-tier subscription plan for its AI chatbot ChatGPT. The move targets India, which the company identifies as its second-largest and fastest-growing global market. The year-long complimentary access to ChatGPT Go comes as a direct response to similar aggressive user acquisition tactics by rivals Google and Perplexity. Both companies recently waived fees for their premium AI features to appeal to the vast Indian consumer base.OpenAI's decision follows Google's move to make its AI Pro membership, priced at Rs 19,500$, free for students for a year. Similarly, Perplexity partnered with telecom giant Airtel to offer free access to its premium plan, intensifying the battle for AI market share in the country.ChatGPT Go, which initially launched in India in August at an affordable monthly price of Rs 399, was designed as a bridge between the free tier and the more expensive ChatGPT Plus subscription. The free ChatGPT Go tier will provide Indian users with significant benefits, including: Higher message limits; Increased daily image generation and uploads; Longer memory for more personalized and context-aware responses"".Since launching ChatGPT Go in India a few months ago, the adoption and creativity we've seen from users has been inspiring,"" said Nick Turley, Vice President and Head of ChatGPT, in a statement. ""Ahead of our first DevDay Exchange event in India, we’re making ChatGPT Go freely available for a year to help more people across India access and benefit from advanced AI.""OpenAI founder and CEO Sam Altman recently highlighted that India is not only the company’s second-largest market but also its fastest-growing. The company noted that since the introduction of the paid ChatGPT Go tier, its overall paid subscriptions in India have more than doubled, underscoring the demand for advanced AI services. The Go plan has since expanded its reach to nearly 90 markets worldwide.","Chatgpt go is openai's mid-tier subscription plan for its ai chatbot chatgpt.

"Indian e-Passport rollout 2025: Embassy confirms no biometrics, no change in charges",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/indian-e-passport-rollout-2025-embassy-confirms-no-biometrics-no-change-in-charges/articleshow/124954371.cms,"UAE Indians Face No Extra Steps for New e-Passport / AI-generated illustration

What does the new e-passport rollout actually mean?

New e-passport = chip inside: The upgraded passport contains an electronic chip with digitised passport data to speed up immigration clearance and improve security. Applicants will be able to upload a digital, ICAO-compliant photo, signature and supporting documents through the new portal.

No extra biometrics or fees: The Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate in Dubai stated explicitly that biometric collection rules and passport fees remain unchanged for applicants in the UAE. If you’ve given biometrics for a recent passport, you will not be asked again just because of the e-passport introduction.

Who issues them: The Embassy and Consulate will process applications through the Passport Seva Portal (GPSP 2.0) with support from BLS International for on-the-ground services. Missions say they can handle large volumes around 1,600 passports a day across the UAE to speed renewals and new issues.

What exactly is an Indian e-Passport?

Digital chip with encrypted security data

Improved fraud protection and identity verification

Faster processing at international airports

Globally compliant with ICAO standard

No change in services for Indians in UAE

Conclusion





Indian expats in the UAE can finally put the rumours to rest. During a press conference held on October 30, 2025 by the Embassy of India in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate General of India in Dubai, officials clarified that the rollout of India’s new chip-enabled e-passport will not involve any extra biometrics, new procedures, or fee changes for applicants in the UAE. The announcement came amid widespread speculation about additional requirements for the upgraded passport system.The e-passport looks like a regular passport but comes with a secure embedded chip containing the holder’s personal and biometric data. This upgrade enhances security and helps speed up global immigration checks, making travel simpler and safer.Key features of the e-passport include:The initiative is an important part of India’s ongoing mission to modernise travel documents, strengthen cyber-security measures, and align with global digital passport standards.For Indian residents in the UAE, the e-passport rollout will feel no different from the current process. Applicants will continue to use the same channels — including BLS centres, VFS services (where applicable), and the embassy or consulate counters, without the need for new appointments, extra document checks, or revised fees. The missions also urged the community to rely only on official updates from the Embassy or Consulate, reminding expats not to fall for misinformation circulating on social media.The clarification from the Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate in Dubai has offered much-needed reassurance to the UAE’s Indian community. With no added fees, no extra biometrics, and no change in the application process, the transition to e-passports is set to be smooth and stress-free for expats. As India modernises its passport system to enhance global travel security, UAE-based applicants can continue using the same familiar services without any disruption. For now, the message is simple: nothing changes for you — just a smarter, more secure passport ahead.","Uae indians face no extra steps for new e-passport.

November 2025 fuel prices

What’s Driving the November price Buzz?

Oil prices dropped to around $65 a barrel, raising hopes for a price cut.

Then global supply tensions and sanctions sent prices jumping again up by nearly 5% in one day.

What will become cheaper if prices drop in November?

Daily Commutes Get Cheaper: If you drive to work five days a week, your monthly fuel spend could drop by AED 15–40, depending on distance and car type. It may not feel like a jackpot but over a year, that’s a few brunches saved.

School Runs for Parents: Parents doing multiple school pick-ups and drop-offs will feel this the most. With fewer refills, you save not just dirhams… but also those “Why are we stopping for petrol again?” kid complaints.

Delivery & Ride-Hailing Services: Talabat, Deliveroo, Careem, Uber, RTA taxis, chauffeur services, all rely heavily on petrol costs. If fuel drops, operating costs drop and sometimes customers enjoy lower delivery fees or promo rides.

Business Transport & Logistics: Couriers, small business vans, carpenters, maintenance and AC technicians, all feel the heat when fuel rises. Cheaper petrol can mean:

Lower service charges Fewer fuel surcharges Better deals for customers

Weekends and Road Trips Become More Tempting: Lower fuel prices = guilt-free drives to Abu Dhabi, Fujairah, Ras Al Khaimah or Hatta. A small drop in fuel cost could shave off AED 5–15 per road trip enough to justify that karak stop.

Analysts expect a marginal reduction of a few fils per litre, which could bring Super 98 down by around 10 fils to approximately AED 2.67 per litre (about ₹61.41) and Special 95 to AED 2.56 per litre (about ₹58.88) if the trend holds.

Guggenheim Museum in New York. (AP Photo, File)





LONDON: For sale: The world's most valuable toilet, a lavatory literally worth its weight in gold. Sotheby's announced Friday it will auction off the solid gold cistern, a sculpture by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan entitled ""America. ""The auction house calls it an ""incisive commentary on the collision of artistic production and commodity value."" It's also a fully functional toilet, identical to one that gained global fame when it was stolen in an audacious heist from England's Blenheim Palace in 2019.The starting price at the Nov 18 auction in New York will be the price of the just over 101.2kg of gold used to make it - about $10 million.David Galperin, head of contemporary art at Sotheby's in New York, said Cattelan is ""the consummate art world provocateur."" He's also one of most successful, an artist whose work ""Comedian,"" a banana duct-taped to a wall, sold at a New York auction last year for $6.2 million. ""Him"" - Cattelan's unsettling sculpture of a kneeling Adolf Hitler - sold for $17.2 million at a Christie's auction in 2016.The artist has said ""America"" satirises excessive wealth.""Whatever you eat, a $200 lunch or a $2 hot dog, the results are the same, toilet-wise,"" he once said.Two versions of ""America"" were created in 2016. The one being sold has been owned by an unnamed collector since 2017. The other version went on display in a bathroom at the Guggenheim Museum in New York in 2016. More than 100,000 visitors queued up to - to put it delicately - interact with the work.The Guggenheim offered the work to US President Donald Trump during his first term in office after he had asked to borrow a Van Gogh painting.In 2019, it went on show at Blenheim Palace, the English country manor that was the birthplace of Winston Churchill. Within days, it was stolen by burglars who broke into the building, forcibly wrenched it from the plumbing, and fled. Two men were convicted earlier this year and jailed. The toilet has never been recovered. Investigators think it was likely broken up and melted down.Galperin is unwilling to speculate on how much ""America"" could sell for. He notes that Cattelan's duct-taped banana posed questions about ""how one assigns value to something that has, in essence, no value aside from its authorship and its conceptual idea.""'America' is in many ways the complete inverse of that. It is a perfect foil in that this work has a lot of intrinsic value in a way that most artworks do not,"" he said ""The question of the proportion of value between the raw materials and the artistic idea is very on the table here.""""America"" will go on display at Sotheby's new New York headquarters, the Breuer Building, from Nov 8 until the auction. It will be in a bathroom, and visitors will be able to see it up close and personal.At Guggenheim and Blenheim Palace, the toilet was connected to the plumbing system and visitors could book a 3-minute appointment to use it. This time, visitors won't be able to use it - they can look, but they can't flush.","Sotheby's will auction off the solid gold cistern, a sculpture by italian artist maurizio cattelan entitled ""america"" it's also a fully functional toilet, identical to one that gained global fame when it was stolen in an audacious heist from england's blenheim palace in 2019.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125008566,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-65280,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Abu Dhabi offers free renewal for business licences expired over three years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/abu-dhabi-offers-free-renewal-for-business-licences-expired-over-three-years/articleshow/125011605.cms,"Abu Dhabi allows businesses with licences expired before 2010 to renew them penalty-free throughout November 2025/Image: WAM

Phase one: Renewal window for pre-2010 licences





Supporting a growing business environment





Economic context and performance





Part of a broader reform agenda









Abu Dhabi has introduced a time-limited initiative allowing investors to renew or update economic licences that have been inactive for three years or more, granting a full waiver on late renewal fees. The move, aimed at encouraging compliance and supporting business continuity, marks another step in the emirate’s strategy to enhance its competitiveness and attract investment.The Abu Dhabi Registration and Licensing Authority (ADRA) has announced that, throughout November 2025, investors whose licences expired before 2010 can regularise their status without incurring any late-renewal penalties.Licences that have remained unrenewed for three years or longer are ordinarily transferred to an expired registry and become subject to revocation. By opening this grace period, ADRA aims to ease the process for affected investors and reintegrate dormant businesses into the formal economy.A timeline for licences that expired after 2010 will be announced in subsequent phases. ADRA confirmed that this staged approach allows for a smooth implementation and ensures all business owners receive equitable access to the support measures.Mohammed Munif Al Mansoori, Director General of ADRA, said the initiative strengthens the emirate’s efforts to improve the ease of doing business and maintain investor confidence.“This initiative supports the ease of doing business by allowing investors to regularise expired licences, while also streamlining processes that enable them to seize the promising opportunities within Abu Dhabi’s dynamic economy,” he said.He added that extending eligibility to licences that lapsed before 2010 underscores Abu Dhabi’s commitment to inclusive support for all business operators.“Our focus remains on delivering effective, business-friendly solutions that simplify licensing from set-up to every stage of the operational life cycle,” Al Mansoori noted.The initiative comes at a time of robust economic performance across Abu Dhabi.In the first half of 2025, the number of active business licences increased by 19 per cent compared with the same period in 2024, reflecting strong investor confidence.According to the Statistics Centre – Abu Dhabi, the emirate’s gross domestic product grew by nearly 4 per cent year-on-year in the second quarter of 2025, reaching Dh306.3 billion ($83.4 billion). Growth has been driven primarily by the non-oil sector, highlighting the capital’s continued diversification away from hydrocarbons.Non-oil foreign trade surged 34.7 per cent in the first half of the year to Dh195.4 billion, underscoring Abu Dhabi’s position as a competitive regional hub for commerce and investment.The business renewal programme aligns with a series of reforms and regulatory updates designed to cultivate an investor-friendly ecosystem. Over recent years, Abu Dhabi has introduced simplified licensing processes, flexible ownership laws, and targeted incentives to attract both domestic and international enterprises.By combining administrative flexibility with sustained economic growth, the new licensing initiative reflects Abu Dhabi’s broader vision: to maintain a transparent, accessible, and forward-looking business environment that supports entrepreneurs and strengthens the emirate’s standing as a global investment destination.","Abu dhabi allows businesses with licences expired before 2010 to renew them penalty-free throughout november 2025.

MUMBAI: In October, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) turned net buyers of stocks in the Indian market again, and infused a little over Rs 14,600 crore. Between July and Sept this year, FPIs had net sold stocks worth a little over Rs 76,600 crore, data from NSDL showed.The net buying by foreign funds was because of resilient corporate earnings of Indian companies, a series of rate cuts by the US Federal Reserve in the last few months, and hopes of a US-India trade deal that would address the ongoing tariff-related issues, among others. The net purchase of domestic equities came despite the rupee hitting a new all-time low against the dollar, market players said.Official data showed that in Sept, foreign funds had net sold stocks worth Rs 23,885 crore, Rs 34,993 crore in Aug and Rs 17,741 crore in July.Oct's Rs 14,610-crore net inflow was the second highest monthly net buying figure for 2025, behind a Rs 19,860-crore inflow in May and just ahead of June figure of Rs 14,590 crore.According to Shrikant Chouhan, head equity research, Kotak Securities, globally investors were again taking a positive view of equities in Oct because of a new trade truce between China and the US, the US Fed cutting interest rates, and Alphabet, Meta, and Microsoft raising their capex guidance.However, going forward, the flows could be volatile, Chouhan said.VK Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist, Geojit Investments, was also cautious about the sustainability of FPI flows through stocks. ""The relatively higher valuations in India may prompt FPIs to sell again. Whether FPIs will buy or sell will depend on the trajectory of India's corporate sector's earnings growth,"" Vijayakumar said. ""There are clear signs of earnings recovery now.

Jefferies has a buy on Adani Power with the price target at Rs 195. Analysts said the company’s Sept quarter earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBITDA) was 4% lower than expectation due to lower utilisation on weak power demand. They also feel the recent thermal tariff power purchase agreements (PPAs) are being signed at close to Rs 6/unit against sub-Rs 5.5/unit earlier, which should lead to better profitability for FY28-FY30.Nomura has a buy on ITC with the target price at Rs 540. Analysts said the company’s July-Sept quarter (Q2FY26) was in-line with expectations.
