Sensex outlook: Worst over?

Global Market Turmoil: US equities bleed as well



Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





What a fall! BSE Sensex and Nifty50 have plunged drastically from their lifetime peaks in a matter of a few months. According to a Bloomberg report, the Indian stock market decline has erased over $1 trillion in market value during the previous four months! This has led to a reduction in India's portion of worldwide market capitalisation.Based on a 20-day average calculation, India's share of global equity market value is approaching 3%, showing a significant decrease from its highest point of over 4% recorded in the previous year, the report said.The Indian stock market is experiencing an unusually prolonged downturn, with a 16% decline from its peak - a correction phase that has lasted significantly longer than typical market adjustments outside major global crises.Historical data examining 20 previous instances of market corrections exceeding 10% (excluding the global financial crisis and Covid-19) reveals that standard corrections averaged 14% and typically resolved within 70 days, states an ET report.Also Read | Why Jim Walker, man who foresaw 2008 market crash, wants investors to ‘absolutely double down’ on Indian equities The current situation stands apart, with the Nifty 200 experiencing a substantial 16% decrease over 165 days, establishing this as one of the most significant and extended downturns in recent market history.This correction differs from previous market declines, which were primarily caused by significant global events. The present downturn lacks a major external catalyst, aside from US trade-related tensions. The primary factors appear to be domestic economic challenges, including poor corporate performance, high valuation levels, and continuous Foreign Institutional Investor withdrawals.What initially appeared as a standard market adjustment has evolved into a persistent decline, affecting both active traders and buy-and-hold investors.The continuous decline in the Nifty since September, extending across approximately six months, represents an unusual pattern. This gradual but persistent downturn presents a notable contrast to the previous extended bull market phase, which continued for 55 months without experiencing even a 5% reduction.The BSE100 companies, comprising major and frequently traded firms on the Bombay Stock Exchange, witnessed their revenue growth decelerate to one-third in the previous calendar year versus 2023, whilst their net profit growth accelerated fivefold, demonstrating successful cost management strategies.Also Read | Trump tariffs and trade tensions: Three reasons why India is best placed in Asia to outperform Analysis of BSE100 data by the financial daily, which offers a comprehensive view of India's equity markets beyond the Sensex, indicated considerable deceleration across industrial, service and consumer sectors.These organisations recorded a 9% increase in revenues and 32% growth in net profit during 2024, in contrast to 25% sales growth and 7% profit increase in 2023.""It is largely due to a slowdown in the overall consumption segment as well as oil, gas and steel businesses, where prices essentially remained benign and hurt value growth,"" Madan Sabnavis, chief economist, Bank of Baroda was quoted as saying. ""If BFSI is excluded, the overall growth will moderate even further. While profit was higher, it was largely due to high base effect, cost control by companies that include cost of production, and marginal salary hikes.""According to Sabnavis, these organisations are anticipated to deliver improved collective results in the upcoming year.Morgan Stanley maintains its year-end Sensex projection of 105,000 points by December 2025, despite recent global tariff conflicts. Morgan Stanley’s team, headed by Ridham Desai, identifies India as 'A stock pickers' market' and notes that India's comparative earnings growth is improving, even considering conservative consensus estimates.A separate analysis from Morgan Stanley suggests that India's position, with minimal share in global manufacturing exports but substantial presence in services exports, could prove advantageous during international trade disputes.“Valuations are the most attractive since the Covid pandemic. The market has ignored the RBI's policy pivot, and a strong budget from the government, among other positive developments since early February. India's low beta characteristic make it an ideal market for the uncertain macro environment that equities are dealing with. Importantly, our sentiment indicator is in strong buy territory,” Desai’s report says.US equity markets have seen a $4 trillion decline in market capitalisation, entering correction territory with a drop exceeding 10% from their December high. The substantial decline stems from economic uncertainties, recession concerns and growing trade disputes, triggering widespread selling that has erased vast amounts of market worth.The technology sector has experienced the steepest declines. Tesla witnessed a single-day value erosion of $125 billion, whilst Apple and Nvidia each declined approximately 5%. The technology component of the S&P 500 registered a 4.3% fall. Additionally, Delta Air Lines shares tumbled 14% following the airline's announcement of halved first-quarter profit projections.","India's share of global equity market value is approaching 3%, showing a significant decrease from its highest point of over 4%.

‘Indians among our biggest job applicants:’ Riyadh Air CEO Tony Douglas,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indians-among-our-biggest-job-applicants-riyadh-air-ceo-tony-douglas/articleshow/118932650.cms,":

NEW DELHI: Aviation industry personnel in India have made a beeline for joining Saudi Arabia’s soon to be launched second national carrier Riyadh Air. The airline website’s career portal has been open for two years on which pilots, cabin crew members, ground, maintenance staff and others can evince interest by submitting their details. “In the last two years, we have received 14 lakh applications from 146 nationalities of which 52% are women. India is one of the biggest source countries for the applications. We are overwhelmed by the interest and faith in our brand despite the fact that so far we have not announced any salary structures,” Riyadh Air CEO Tony Douglas said here Wednesday.The upcoming full service airline has ordered up to 132 aircraft, Airbus A321neos and Boeing 787 Dreamliners. It is currently in talks with both Boeing and Airbus for placing orders for ultra long range wide bodies with the choice being between the B777 9X and A350-1000. It currently has one aircraft and 500 employees, including 36 cabin crew and pilots each. “After Saudis, the second biggest nationality of employees is Indians. Ditto for the population of Singapore,” he said.The airline, which is going to start operations in a few months, says India is a key market for it. “In 2024 Saudi Arabia saw 15 lakh tourists from India which was a 50% jump over previous year. Ninety-three per cent of flyers at Riyadh are point to point and just 7% are in transit. That shows the scope of growth from India as well as of our connecting potential from our hub, Riyadh, as our fleet grows. Nearby Doha has 80% transfer traffic and the figures for Dubai are also very high,” Douglas said.The Saudi Tourism Authority aims to welcome 75 lakh visitors from India per annum by the close of the decade. Unlike Dubai, Qatar, Singapore and many other countries/regions, Saudi still has a lot of unutilized bilaterals or flying rights for India that Riyadh Air will use. The CEO and his team are meeting both IndiGo and Air India management to discuss partnerships with them. “We have made good partnerships like Delta for North America; two airlines in China and some other countries. We have two gaps, one in northwestern Europe and the other in India which is a huge market,” he said. The Riyadh Air delegation will meet the officials at the Directorate General of Civil Aviation and Embassy of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia for “requisite permissions and support to launch India operations.”Douglas said“India has long been a crucial part of Riyadh Air’s network planning ahead of our operations launch. India is a beautiful nation which will play a big part in the success story of our airline, as travel and business opportunities multiply with the expanded offerings we are set to provide. Beyond connecting people, fostering economic growth, and enhancing and diversifying the Saudi Arabian and Indian tourism sectors, Riyadh Air’s network will help develop even stronger bonds between the two great countries.”","The airline website’s career portal has been open for two years on which pilots, cabin crew members, ground, maintenance staff and others can evince interest by submitting their details. “in the last two years, we have received 14 lakh applications from 146 nationalities of which 52% are women,” riyadh air ceo tony douglas said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118932629,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-853913,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Socialite Shalini Passi , wife of businessman Sanjay Passi , has been summoned by the Meerut unit of Directorate General of GST Intelligence ( DGGI ) for questioning on Thursday in a case of alleged Goods and Services Tax evasion.According to sources, the matter pertains to alleged short payment of GST by Pasco Motors LLP of which she was a partner. Shalini Passi shot to fame after starring in the ‘Fablous Lives of Bollywood Housewives’ on Netflix.Pasco Motors LLP is an authorised dealer of Tata Motors and is in the business of sale of heavy motor vehicles, both chassis and fully built buses and trucks. The tax intelligence department had earlier served summons to Sanjay Passi and other executives of Pasco Motors but they are yet to join the investigation.J K Mittal, lawyer of Sanjay Passi, has denied any tax evasion and told TOI that the allegations are false. “GST summons issued by the DGGI is malafide and the information of tax evasion is not mentioned in the said summon at all,” he said, adding that the matter has already been challenged in the Punjab and Haryana HC and is presently sub judice. Mittal also confirmed that Shalini Passi was a partner in Pasco Motors LLP and DGGI was making an inquiry into alleged “short payment of GST” as mentioned in the summons.Sources said while supplying fully built-up buses and trucks, Pasco Motors issues a single invoice but splits the total value into two components: the value of the chassis, which is charged at a GST rate of 28%, and the value of body fabrication, which is charged at a GST rate of 18%.“As per the law, if a bus body builder constructs and supplies a fully built-up bus, the entire supply should be taxed at flat 28% GST. Therefore, Pasco Motors LLP is evading GST by charging different GST rates for the chassis and body fabrications in a single invoice,” a source said.GST Intelligence has asked the company to clarify the differential rate of GST billed to customers and provide supporting documents. After queries remained unanswered, the agency sent summons to the company and its partners to record statements and ensure compliance. Generally, summonses are issued after non-compliance and non-cooperation by the other party.",Shalini passi shot to fame after starring in the ‘fablous lives of bollywood housewives’ on netflix.

Brett Favre Criticizes ESPN's Teaser, Defending Mark Gastineau's Reputation

NFL legend Mark Gastineau is taking a swing at ESPN — legally this time — accusing the network of damaging his reputation by posting an edited video of his altercation with Brett Favre . And now? He wants $25 million in damages.The drama unfolded in November 2023 at a sports show in Chicago, where Mark Gastineau confronted former Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre over a decades-old controversy. The beef? A 2002 game where Brett Favre gave up what many saw as an ""easy"" sack to Michael Strahan — a move that allowed Strahan to break Mark Gastineau’s single-season sack record.In the now-viral clip obtained by ESPN, Mark Gastineau was visibly upset, repeatedly telling Brett Favre that his actions during that game ""hurt me."" The network used the heated exchange as a teaser for theirdocumentary — but according to Mark Gastineau, they left out a crucial part of the story.In his lawsuit, filed in a federal court in New York on March12, 2025, Mark Gastineau argues that ESPN intentionally cut the moment where he and Brett Favre shook hands after the confrontation. This, he says, made him appear far more aggressive than he actually was.Mark Gastineau also claims that he never gave ESPN permission to record the private interaction. To make matters worse, when he officially agreed to participate in thedocumentary in January 2024, there was an understanding that he'd have approval over any edits — including the Brett Favre clip.Now, Mark Gastineau says the edited footage has sparked a wave of online attacks, with people mocking and ridiculing him on social media. Feeling blindsided by the way the situation was portrayed, he's demanding $25 million in damages.Interestingly, Brett Favre seems to be in Mark Gastineau's corner on this one. Back in December 2024, Brett Favre spoke out against ESPN’s teaser, calling it a ""private moment of frustration between two old football warriors"" that shouldn’t have been filmed and released. He even praised Mark Gastineau, saying the controversy should remind people of ""just how great Mark Gastineau was.""As of now, ESPN hasn't responded to the lawsuit — but with a $25 million price tag attached, this legal showdown is far from over.Stay tuned as this sports drama continues to unfold.Also read - Breaking Down the Worst Contracts of NFL Free Agency 2025 — Who Got Overpaid?","Nfl legend mark gastineau is suing espn for $25 million in damages.

Many subscribers felt that the delay was not only unexpected but also a betrayal of Netflix’s promised content schedule.Numerous users took to X (formerly Twitter) to voice their frustrations, with some even threatening to cancel their subscriptions. One user wrote, ""I have canceled my Netflix subscription. This is the last time Netflix lies about releasing a show for me."" Another fumed, ""Netflix, count your f*****g days!! We want the bin Laden documentary NOW, as advertised!!!"" A third demanded compensation, posting, ""Paying a ridiculous amount of money to watch the bin Laden doc on Netflix, just for it not to be uploaded. Smh. Refund?""The controversy surrounding the documentary’s delay has only intensified as Netflix has yet to provide a clear explanation for the sudden change.Despite the growing controversy, Netflix has remained largely silent on the matter.Entertainment journalist Rama’s Screen reportedly reached out to Netflix for clarification. However, the streaming giant only provided a vague response, stating that the documentary has been rescheduled for a later, unspecified date.So far, no official statement has been released addressing the delay, leaving frustrated viewers uncertain about whether American Manhunt: Osama bin Laden will premiere anytime soon.","Netflix subscribers were left frustrated and confused after the highly anticipated three-part documentary american manhunt: osama bin laden failed to premiere on its scheduled release date of march 10, 2025. The documentary was set to provide an in-depth account of the decade-long u.s. military operation to locate and eliminate the al-qaeda leader.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118931030,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-38066,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Meghan Markle's father blasts her new Netflix cookery show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/shes-faking-it-for-the-cameras-meghan-markles-father-blasts-her-new-netflix-cookery-show/articleshow/118855446.cms,"This image released by Netflix shows Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, left, and Mindy Kaling in a scene from ""With Love, Meghan."" (Netflix via AP)

With Love,

Meghan

With Love, Meghan

The Duchess of Sussex , in the second episode of her new Netflix cookery show, shares how her passion for jam-making stems from childhood memories of her grandmother making apple butter. However, her estranged father, 80-year-old Thomas Markle Sr , has criticised the series, claiming Meghan has ""never been authentic"" and that ""she's faking it for the cameras.""He said that whilst his mother Doris, who passed away in 2011, deeply cared for Meghan, she would be distressed by her granddaughter's recent statements. ""I haven't seen the show but I've seen a ton of clips and I've read many stories. I might sit down and watch it one day but I'm not sure,"" Meghan’s father, Thomas Markle Sr told The Daily Mail on Sunday.During the show, viewers noticed an interaction between Meghan and Mindy Kaling , where Meghan interrupts her friend for using ' Meghan Markle ', stating: ""It's so funny you keep saying 'Meghan Markle', you know I'm 'Sussex' now.""Thomas responded: ""My mum loved Meghan very much but she would be so disappointed to hear that Meghan no longer wants to use the name ""Markle."" He further remarked sarcastically: ""Now I have to say, I am Meghan Sussex's dad.""Thomas, a seasoned Hollywood professional who has worked on shows like Married… with Children and General Hospital, shared insights from his industry experience, stating that: ""Cooking shows are horrendously boring unless the presenter has a passion for it.""""You have to be authentic to hold people’s attention. When you are stuffing the turkey’s ass it has to look like you’re having fun doing it. Unfortunately Meghan has never been authentic. She has to think about everything. She's not spontaneous. Everything she says is pre-planned and rehearsed. It makes me laugh because I know all her looks and expressions,"" the retired TV lighting director, said.He continued: ""I know when she's faking it for the cameras. She's trying so hard to be perfect that she tenses up every time the camera is on her.""""The best cooks are funny, they mess up, they are human. She just wants to be perfect. It’s sad because she’s trying so hard to stay in the limelight,"" he added.In the Netflix series, Meghan portrayed herself as a ""latchkey kid"" and discussed her supposedly modest upbringing, claiming regular consumption of fast food and TV dinners stating that: ""I grew up with a lot of fast food and also a lot of TV tray dinners. It feels like such a different time but that was so normal with the microwavable kids meals.'Thomas countered this narrative, explaining, ""We occasionally ate TV dinners, which family doesn’t?’ But I was working two jobs so money was never an issue. We would eat out at least three times a week and order in the rest of the time.""Contrary to claims of a fast-food upbringing, Meghan regularly visited Musso & Frank, an upscale Hollywood establishment operating since 1919, which was her preferred dining spot.Thomas elaborated: ""Like any single father who did a long day's work, I'd occasionally put a TV dinner in the microwave. But most of the time we'd go out. After school I would either pick her up myself and we'd go out to eat or I'd send a car to bring her to the set. She grew up on the sets I worked on. She was never a latchkey kid.""He noted that whilst his former spouse excelled at cooking, Meghan showed limited interest in culinary pursuits during her childhood.

Q:

How do you manage to write under the pressure of the standards you set for yourself?

A:

Q:

While I was reading your books, I kept thinking you're writing self-portraits, but in a sense, a self-portrait of you emerges as well, along with your parents. And it's a leisurely pace, as if one was walking through a museum.

A:

Q:

In your books you talk about the cultural and the socioeconomic context, and the lives that these individual artists lived. And you also do it in your analysis of artists who are women.

A:

Q:

What I marvel at is how your writing styles are so distinct in your three books that I've seen. And yet it's you.

A:

Listen here:Excerpts from the interview:I write about art during the week for my newspaper, The Observer, with what I think of as my right hand. I write about art for my books, art and life and the intersection between them, which is my special subject, with my left hand, if you like. My brain is playing split between these two worlds, between the professional commitments for my newspaper and then for book writing, which is where I feel a freedom and a comfort and a different kind of audience and a different kind of time scheme. And one is able to tell stories at length about painters and life and culture, and, in my case, in the new book, about sudden death and accidents and my father, who flew planes in India, in fact, in the Second World War.The way you describe that perfectly goes to my experience of museums and of looking at art, which all of the people listening will know, which is that when you're in a museum, you miss paintings. There are crowds in front of paintings. There are paintings that you feel are very particularly yours because you found them and you're alone looking at them. And I think of museums as being almost like cities where people walk and they see other people. In the case of artworks, I'm thinking of them as having a kind of personality. I feel that museums are like the places that we live. And they're not very different to me, in my mind. And all of the books that I have written do have moments I've described in the current book 'Thunderclap. They are moments where a person, particularly painters, see a work of art and there's a huge moment, and the feeling that you are seeing something really radically connected to you and only to you, and everybody has a different experience of everything. All of my books are arguing the same thing, which is that the human relationship with art is entirely personal.I always feel that I'm a bit mutinous, about art historians, because with regard to Dutch art, and this very much goes to women painting in the mid century, in the 17th century, we're always being told what to see, what to think. This is a symbol. Here is a skull. It must be about death. Here's a piece of cheese, maybe that's about death… Dutch art is very particularly supposedly full of these, you know, warnings against mortality and vanity and so on, but they really aren't. So one argument about Dutch art is that it's all symbolic. And I think, no, they're not. They're about the incredible beauty of the world and the amazing way that light gives its grace to everything that we look at around us and so on. And they're about the wonder of art, and they're not about something very simple. And. And what is always said about Dutch art, and I think completely wrongly, is that it's a sequence of photographs. And it's so democratic, it's so all embracing, and it's so infinite in its reach through everything that you can see. Everything is imagined, remarked upon, remembered, felt and painted by the artists.I can't paint and I can't sculpt. And I'm terrible at taking photographs, but I appreciate them enormously. So the only thing I have is words because I can't draw. And if I could draw, maybe I would be making art. But as it is, I have the thing I have which is just words and practice with words and so on. So I'm putting words to images and things that I want to praise and things that I want the viewer to see. And it arrives out of the fact that I couldn't be an artist because I had no talent.","Laura cummings challenges 'photographic' view of dutch paintings. Cummings: 'i can't paint and i can't sculpt.

Croatia is trying a Roman emperor’s price cap to tame inflation. Will it work?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/croatia-is-trying-a-roman-emperors-price-cap-to-tame-inflation-will-it-work/articleshow/118827556.cms,"File photo

SPLIT (CROATIA): In AD 301, Emperor Diocletian made a bold but ultimately unsuccessful bid to address the inflation that was rampaging across the eastern half of the divided Roman Empire. Prices of everything from purple thread and feathers to cattle were dictated by his Edict on Maximum Prices. Violators faced the death penalty. Diocletian gave up power about four years after issuing his edict, watching his measure fail from his sprawling retirement palace in the heart of what became the city of Split in Croatia.Now Croatia’s govt is trying a similar tactic to rein in prices, which have soared in recent years and have sparked protests and retail boycotts by the country’s beleaguered consumers. The govt introduced price controls for retailers last month, targeting supermarket items such as bread, pork and shampoo. The penalties are less drastic than those decreed by Diocletian, mandating a fine of up to €30,000, for retailers breaking the rules. It is unclear whether the new edict will be any more successful than Diocletian’s, which economists say ended up being counterproductive by causing shortages, fuelling a black market and enabling profiteers. For the moment, consumers are still figuring out how to navigate the new system, which caps the price of 70 common grocery store products.Anita Kargotic, 62, went shopping recently at a Spar supermarket, where two signs were posted outside listing the maximum prices allowed for a range of goods. She tied her American Akita, named Maja, to a post outside, and later emerged from the store with a haul of kaiser rolls, popcorn kernels, soy flakes and crackers. Most were store-brand gene rics, already less expensive than more recognisable labels.Flea collars and dry dog food? Those are necessities. Grapes? No, too expensive. Staples like rice and pasta? Pass. “Those prices have become completely unreasonable,” she said.The new rules are the govt’s third attempt at controlling prices by fiat since Sept 2022. The first two efforts were largely ineffective, with retailers simply refusing to stock most pricecontrolled goods. The govt says it is serious this time, and it has promised regular inspections and fines for violators.Under the new rules brought in by PM Andrej Plenkovic, shop entrances must display a list of all 70 items that fall under the govt’s pricing regulations. Centuries ago, Diocleti an’s edict accused some citizens of price gouging and said their greed needed to be reined in. In Jan, Plenkovic struck a similar tone. “We support companies that work well and make a profit, but within realistic frames. That can’t be at the expense of the little guy,” he said.Many people say price controls are not the answer. John H. Cochrane, an economist, pointed to the role Diocletian’s edict played in causing shortages and fuelling a black market. “It’s like trying to stem the symptoms rather than treating the underlying disease,” Cochrane said of price controls.","Croatia's govt introduced price controls for retailers last month, targeting supermarket items such as bread, pork and shampoo.
