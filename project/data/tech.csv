"Jayant Narlikar: Walking softly, carrying a big shtick",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jayant-narlikar-walking-softly-carrying-a-big-shtick/articleshow/121303098.cms,"Stellar cosmologist Jayant Narlikar 's passing at 86 on Tuesday, peacefully and in sleep, is reminiscent of the gift of death at will, or the ""ichha-mrityu"" that grandsire Bhishma supposedly had in the Mahabharata. And speaking of grandsires, the demise of this much-decorated and beloved doyen of Indian astrophysicists coincides with the departures of larger-than-life grey eminences M R Srinivasan, venerated ""architect"" of India's atomic power programme, and Saroj Ghose, the much-admired ""father of the science museums movement"" in India.A man of exemplary personal grace and modesty, Narlikar epitomised what the American adage of ""walk softly but carry a big stick"" advocates. And what a shtick he wielded. Barely in his twenties, had he not the intellectual audacity to challenge the scientific theories, if not shibboleths, advanced by mages of the calibre of Albert Einstein and (posthumously) Ernst Mach and Kurt Godell? The Hoyle-Narlikar Theory of Gravity challenged the more popular Big Bang Theory of the birth of the universe, ostensibly from nothingness.Rather than sudden inflation, Narlikar and his mentor envisioned a steady expansion as an alternative model of cosmic genesis. Of course, in the true spirit of science, evidence ""background radiation"" garnered later put more bucks on the Big Bang than on Slow Pulse (prompting Prof Hoyle to recite a line to The Times of India during a long interview: ""Theories that come roaring like lions also, alas, retreat bleating like lambs!"")Like our early science stalwarts C V Raman, Homi Bhabha and Meghnad Saha, Narlikar was brilliant at public outreach and pedagogy.And the centre he set up for inter-universities research in Pune did win him a Unesco Kalinga Award.When he won the Sahitya Akademi Prize for his Marathi autobiography Narlikar spoke out against kite-flying - flights of fancy and fashionable claims being made on behalf of ""ancient"" Indian science these days. These included make-in-India vimanas and astras used by gods, demons and heroes for settling local land disputes.To separate such claims from science fiction - a genre in which Narlikar had also made a mark just as his mentor Fred Hoyle did - pure science demands stronger proof, or Pramana. The latter also happens to be the title of the India-born research journal on physics and maths, an arena in which Narlikar excelled winning a Wrangler at Cambridge (with a mathematical Tripos), just as Narlikar's father had done.By claiming credit for things about which we have no evidence or proof, Narlikar warned we run the risk of reducing the credibility of what our scientists did achieve in the past.Conversely, in his book Scientific Edge, Narlikar exhorts our science buffs and aficionados to boast about epic inventions of our ancestors, such as the concept of zero that completely revolutionised mathematics globally.In his fireside chats about the story of "" Zero as a Hero "", Narlikar also used to highlight a ""publish or perish"" (aka 'publicise or perish' for scribes) moral for wannabe scientists. For the longest time, he emphasised, Arabs got exclusive credit for what are now rightfully called ""Hindu"" numerals.The polymath also used to extol the ancient roots of scepticism in India, not perhaps of the kind of journalism practised by Skeptical Inquirer today but that of the Rig Veda, the oldest recorded Sanskrit poem in the world, which contains the priceless Nasadiya Sukta, an epiphany that dares to question the very existence of gods while raising cosmological questions of such profundity as would gladden moderns seers such as Guth, Hawking and Penrose.","Jayant narlikar's passing at 86 on tuesday, peacefully and in sleep, is reminiscent of the gift of death at will, or the ""ichha-mrityu"" that grandsire bhishma supposedly had in the mahabharata.

Highlighting India's achievements in this regard, Modi, in a video message, said, ""We have a digital platform to track vaccination of pregnant women and children. Millions of people have a unique digital health identity. It is helping us integrate benefits, insurance, records and information."" He said with telemedicine, nobody is too far from a doctor. ""Our free telemedicine service has enabled over 340 million consultations,"" Modi said.The PM recalled his address to the 2023 World Health Assembly, in which he had spoken of 'One Earth, One Health' and had pointed out that the future of a healthy world depends on inclusion, an integrated vision and collaboration.Emphasising that inclusion is at the core of India's health reforms, he highlighted Ayushman Bharat, world's largest health insurance scheme that covers 580 million people & provides free treatment.He noted India's extensive network of thousands of health and wellness centres facilitates early screening and detection of diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and hypertension.","India has a digital platform to track vaccination of pregnant women and children.

(AI image)

Mango Shipments to US rejected

US authorities have rejected no fewer than 15 mango shipments from India at various airports, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Atlanta, due to documentation irregularities. The exporters faced the choice of either destroying the fruit in the US or sending it back to India. Given the perishable nature of mangoes and the substantial costs involved in return shipping, all exporters opted to dispose of the mango shipments locally.The United States represents India's primary export destination for mangoes, making these incidents particularly significant for the trade relationship.Considering mangoes are perishable and the substantial expenses linked to destruction or re-exportation, traders anticipate losses of around $500,000.The mangoes had undergone the required irradiation process in Mumbai on May 8 and 9. However, according to an ET report US officials found inconsistencies in the documentation related to this mandatory treatment, which involves exposing the fruit to controlled radiation doses to eliminate pests and prolong shelf life. The issue stemmed from administrative errors in the pest-control documentation rather than actual pest presence, the report said. USDA communication to an affected exporter indicated that US Customs and Border Protection refused entry ""due to incorrectly issued PPQ203."" The notice specified that the shipment ""must be re-exported or destroyed,"" whilst clarifying that the US government would not bear costs for ""remedial measures for this shipment.""The irradiation procedure takes place at a facility situated in Navi Mumbai, overseen by a US Department of Agriculture (USDA) representative. This official is tasked with validating the PPQ203 form, which is essential for mango exports to the US. ""We are being penalised for mistakes made at the irradiation facility,"" an exporter said.Also Read | Why India can be a big winner of Donald Trump 2.0 era if it plays its cards right Another exporter, whose consignment was detained at Los Angeles airport during May 9-11, before receiving destruction orders, was notified that the shipment failed to satisfy the ""entry requirement,"" specifically regarding the mandatory irradiation treatment.The exporter firmly denied the allegation, asserting that the irradiation procedure was completed and the PPQ203 form was issued following the treatment. ""How can we receive the form if the treatment was never done? And without that form, issued by none other than the USDA officer, the mangoes couldn't even have been cleared for loading at Mumbai airport,"" he said.When asked about the specifics of the case, including the quantity of affected mangoes and documentation discrepancies, the Agricultural and Processed Food Products Authority (APEDA) chairman's office responded, ""The matter pertains to the shipment of mangoes from USDA approved facility, Maharashtra State Agricultural Marketing Board (MSAMB) located at Vashi, Mumbai. Hence inputs may be sought from them. "" APEDA operates under the ministry of commerce and industry. MSAMB did not provide any response to the email enquiry.Meanwhile, India and US are looking to seal a trade deal soon. US President Donald Trump has claimed that India has offered a deal with 'literally no tariffs'. The first phase of the deal is expected to be completed in the coming months.India aims to enhance two-way trade by seeking tariff reductions from the United States for sectors employing large workforces. These include textiles, gems and jewellery, leather goods, garments, plastics, chemicals, shrimp, oil seeds, chemicals, grapes, and bananas under the proposed trade agreement.The United States, in return, seeks reduced duties across various sectors including industrial products, automobiles (specifically electric vehicles), wines, petrochemical products, dairy items, agricultural produce such as apples, and tree nuts.According to a Bloomberg report, India is eyeing a three-phase trade deal with the US ahead of July when Trump's reciprocal tariffs become effective.Also Read | Donald Trump says India has offered a trade deal with ‘literally no tariffs’","Mango shipments to us rejected at los angeles, san francisco, and atlanta airports.

User-friendly features and simplified process Enhanced security and data protection

NEW DELHI: Home minister Amit Shah on Monday launched the revamped portal for overseas citizens of India (OCI), which will offer the existing 5 million OCI cardholders as well as fresh applicants, a user-friendly experience in accessing OCI services and facilitate their comfortable stay in India.Prime Minister Narendra Modi, in a post on X, hailed the initiative, stating that “with enhanced features and improved functionality, the new OCI portal marks a major step forward in boosting citizen-friendly digital governance”.Speaking at the launch event here, Shah said that India, led by PM Modi, is continuously striving to provide world-class immigration facilities to its OCI cardholders. The revamped OCI portal will have an updated user interface to simplify the registration process for OCIs, he said.The home minister emphasised that Indian-origin citizens residing in various countries worldwide “must face no inconvenience when visiting or staying in India”.The new OCI portal seeks to address existing limitations and enhance user experience, relying on the significant technological advancements over the past decade and the feedback received from OCI cardholders.The portal allows features like sign up; auto-fill of user profile details in OCI registration forms; integrated online payment gateway; and eligibility criteria and categorisation of requisite documents to be uploaded, based on application type.The applicant can edit information in the form prior to final submission. There will be frequently asked questions (FAQs) to guide the applicants — who may be registering afresh for OCI card, those with persons of Indian origin (PIO) cards discontinued in 2019, and those with lost PIO cards. The portal will display a dashboard displaying details of completed and partially filled applications.The refurbished OCI platform features upgrades to the software and platform and has enhanced security protocols built in,including encryption to ensure data privacy. New cyber-security enhancements include multi-factor authorisation.The overseas citizen of India (OCI) scheme was introduced through an amendment to the Citizenship Act, 1955, in 2005. It provides for the registration of persons of Indian origin (PIOs) as OCI, provided they were citizens of India on or after January 26, 1950, or were eligible to become citizens on that date. However, individuals who are or had been or whose parent or grandparent or great grandparent citizens of Pakistan or Bangladesh are not eligible.The existing OCI Services portal was developed in 2013 and is currently operational in over 180 Indian missions abroad as well as 12 FRROs, processing approximately 2,000 applications per day.","Home minister amit shah on monday launched the revamped portal for overseas citizens of india (oci) the portal will offer the existing 5 million oci cardholders as well as fresh applicants, a user-friendly experience in accessing oci services.

Poll Do you believe India's indigenous high-altitude platform will enhance border security? No Yes

Cong Leader Jairam Ramesh BLASTS Modi Govt, Says Delegation Move Just For Optics & Headlines

Border patrolling

IAF wants similar systems

BENGALURU: India’s indigenous high-altitude platform (HAP) project has completed another flight test campaign — crucial pre-monsoon flight tests with an upgraded certified autopilot system — of its subscale prototype developed by the National Aerospace Laboratories (NAL).The solar-powered stratospheric vehicle , which navigated through cloud cover during back-to-back test flights between May 8 and 13, holds the potential to boost India’s border security infrastructure and surveillance technology, once ready.The tests were carried out at the Aeronautical Test Range (ATR) in Challakere in Chitradurga, some 200km from the city. The HAP now utilises a certified sensor redundant control system hardware, enabling fully autonomous vehicle operation through custom control laws, navigation algorithms, and automated fail safes for all possible scenarios. In simpler terms, it now has a certified autopilot system.“By developing proprietary systems rather than adopting the open-source approach common among UAV developers nationally and globally, NAL has joined the select few organisations worldwide pursuing certification—a critical requirement for integration into the national airspace system,” L Venkatakrishnan, programme director of HAP at NAL, told TOI.The recent tests demonstrated the platform’s capability to maintain flight even with reduced energy production due to cloud cover, with the vehicle successfully reaching altitudes of 24,000 feet (FL240 in aviation terminology).The subscale prototype, with a 12-metre wingspan weighing less than 22kg, has already achieved flight endurance of more than 8.5 hours at altitudes of almost 7km above mean sea level during tests conducted in May last year, using an open source auto-pilot system.The certified autopilot system, Venkatakrishnan said, is robust enough to enable completely autonomous flight without human intervention. “This is the same autopilot which will work on the full-scale vehicle we are building,” he said.Though functioning as a testbed for aerodynamic design and subsystems intended for the full-scale model, the subscale HAP offers significant capabilities in its own right. “With a payload capacity of nearly 1kg and an operating altitude of up to 25,000 feet, it can patrol hundreds of miles of national borders that would otherwise require human presence. Additional applications include geoinformatics, meteorology, and crowd monitoring,” Venkatakrishnan said.The full-scale HAP will expand these capabilities, offering a 10kg payload capacity from 65,000 feet (20km) altitude with geographic persistence.It’s noteworthy that the Indian Air Force (IAF), earlier this month, issued a Request for Information (RFI) for such High-Altitude Platform Systems. However, no comparable system has yet been deployed globally for military or other purposes.Given the unique weather challenges of the Indian subcontinent and strategic considerations regarding asset availability during emergencies, indigenous development is critical.However, procurement will depend on how quickly indigenous systems like the one NAL is developing can become available to the armed forces and how efficiently they work. NAL expects its full-scale HAP to be ready for flight testing by the first quarter of 2026.Beyond military applications, the platform shows promising civilian use cases. The Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, has expressed interest in using our HAP to deploy radiosondes for internal measurements of monsoon clouds, while telecommunications applications are also being explored.“We are already ready to carry a 5G base station because in terms of power and size-weight it can easily do that,” Venkatakrishnan said, highlighting the platform's potential to serve as an aerial telecommunications relay.","India's indigenous high-altitude platform (hap) project has completed another flight test campaign.

Updates to Project Mariner



Google I/O 2025 is underway and company CEO Sundar Pichai has made three consumer-centric major announcements. These initiatives, powered by Google's Gemini AI models, include Google Beam (formerly Project Starline) updates and real-time speech translation in Google Meet; 'better' Project Astra coming as Gemini Live camera conversation, and Project Mariner -- updates to agentic AI capabilities that can help users automate tasks -- all powered by Google Gemini AI models.Pichai announced that Google Beam, previously known as Project Starline, is coming to computers from HP. It is essentially a technology initiative that has been designed to enhance remote communication by making it more immersive and natural. This system utilises a combination of advanced 3D imaging, artificial intelligence, and other sophisticated technologies to simulate face-to-face interactions during video calls.Pichai highlighted the key features of Google Beam include realistic 3D imaging for lifelike representation, enabling natural eye contact often absent in standard video calls.The second feature coming from this project is real-time speech translation in Google Meet, allowing people to converse even if they do not know each others' language. Google also said that that the AI-generated translation will preserve the sound of users' voices, tone and expressions. The feature is currently available for English and Spanish to subscribers. Google will also test this feature with Workspace users later this year in other languages including Italian, German and Portuguese.Last year, Google previewed Gemini Live and later launched it on Android and iPhones. At the I/O 2025, Pichai showcased how Gemini Live camera can be used in daily life by allowing users to ask about anything by just pointing their camera at anything and speak in natural language. The feature will arrive in Google Search as part of its expanded AI Mode on Android and iPhones, Pichai said.The third big announcement is updates to Project Mariner -- is a Chrome extension developed by Google DeepMind that allows users to automate web browsing tasks using an AI agent. It leverages Gemini AI model to create an AI Agent that can understand and interact with websites, completing tasks like research, booking and purchasing. Pichai explained that the AI tool can now manage up to 10 tasks at the same time.","Google i/o 2025 is underway and company ceo sundar pichai has made three consumer-centric major announcements.

As the tech giant pushes deeper into artificial intelligence, industry experts question the decision. Find out why even AI leaders weren’t safe from Microsoft’s sudden cuts.

Poll Do you think AI will replace more jobs in the future? No, humans will always be needed. Yes, it's inevitable.

To those also affected—you're not alone, we're at least 6,000, says Microsoft's fired AI director

Microsoft announced last week that it is laying off approximately 6,000 employees, nearly 3% of its global workforce—in what marks the company's second-largest job reduction in its history. Among those affected was Gabriela de Queiroz , Director of Artificial Intelligence for Microsoft for Startups , who shared the ""bittersweet news"" of her departure on social media.""I was impacted by Microsoft's latest round of layoffs. Am I sad? Absolutely. I'm heartbroken to see so many talented people I've had the honor of working with being let go. These are people who cared deeply, went above and beyond, and truly made a difference,"" Gabriela de Queiroz wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter), alongside a picture of herself smiling.The layoffs come as Microsoft aggressively pushes into artificial intelligence, with CEO Satya Nadella revealing in April that AI now writes up to 30% of code in some Microsoft projects. Software engineers bore the brunt of the cuts, representing over 40% of the approximately 2,000 positions eliminated in Washington state alone, according to Bloomberg analysis.Despite being asked to stop work immediately and set an out-of-office message, Gabriela de Queiroz chose to stay longer. ""I chose to stay a little longer—showing up for meetings, saying goodbye, wrapping up what I could. That felt right to me,"" she explained in her social media posts.The irony of laying off an AI director while the company invests heavily in AI technology wasn't lost on industry observers. One Microsoft vice president recently told his team to use AI chatbots to generate half their computer code, up from the current 20-30%, before more than a dozen engineers on his team were subsequently laid off.""But if you know me, you know I always look at the bright side.

Contest evaluation and future prospects



In the highly competitive landscape of instant messaging platforms, Telegram, a popular messaging app founded by Pavel Durov , has initiated a bold new contest aimed at content creators. The competition offers a prize pool of $50,000 for a viral video that underscores Telegram’s claim of being the original innovator in messaging technology — years ahead of its competitor WhatsApp, which Telegram labels a “cheap copycat.”This initiative marks Telegram’s first contest designed specifically for content creators, signaling the company’s increased focus on leveraging user-generated content to raise awareness about its platform’s unique features and capabilities. The contest was announced on May 19, 2025, by Pavel Durov himself, and aims to counteract alleged smear campaigns against Telegram by WhatsApp. With a submission deadline set for May 26, 2025, the campaign encourages participation from global audiences, aiming to clarify Telegram’s contributions to the messaging industry.Telegram and WhatsApp are two of the largest messaging platforms worldwide, both competing for dominance in the instant communication space. WhatsApp, owned by Meta Platforms Inc., boasts over two billion users globally, while Telegram, known for its focus on privacy and advanced features, has seen rapid growth, particularly in regions emphasizing secure messaging. The rivalry has intensified over the years, with Telegram frequently highlighting its pioneering features that WhatsApp later incorporated, and vice versa.Pavel Durov, Telegram’s CEO and founder, has publicly accused WhatsApp of conducting smear campaigns against Telegram, aiming to undermine its reputation. In response, Telegram’s new contest serves as a public relations strategy to emphasize Telegram’s innovative edge and solidify its position among messaging app users.The contest invites participants to create a viral video no longer than three minutes (180 seconds) that celebrates Telegram’s technological advancements and innovation history relative to WhatsApp. Key aspects of the contest include:Telegram provides participants with a curated list of 30 key features that the app introduced before WhatsApp adopted similar functionalities. However, Pavel Durov notes that the list is not exhaustive and that many. Telegram features still have no counterparts on WhatsApp.Telegram has long promoted its role as an innovator in the messaging app industry. The platform introduced a variety of features now commonplace in WhatsApp and other competitors, including:This innovation-driven branding underpins Telegram’s appeal to privacy-conscious users, tech enthusiasts, and developers worldwide.The contest arrives at a time when Telegram is increasingly positioning itself as a privacy-focused alternative to mainstream messaging apps. This strategy is part of a broader trend among users concerned about data privacy, censorship, and control over digital communication platforms.Simultaneously, Telegram’s open nature and support for bots and APIs have made it popular among developers and businesses seeking customizable communication tools. The contest, therefore, not only serves marketing objectives but also reinforces Telegram’s identity as a technology leader.In conjunction with the contest announcement, Pavel Durov addressed additional political pressures Telegram faces globally. On his Telegram channel, he claimed that a Western European government (implied to be France) had requested Telegram to silence conservative political voices in Romania ahead of the country’s presidential elections held on May 18, 2025. Durov stated that Telegram refused the request, emphasizing the platform’s commitment to protecting political freedom and user rights without blocking political channels.This statement underscores Telegram’s stance on political neutrality and freedom of expression, positioning the platform as resistant to government censorship demands.The contest opens opportunities for a wide range of content creators, including video producers, social media influencers, and digital marketers. By incentivizing creative promotion of Telegram’s features, the company aims to increase its user base and engagement on emerging social media platforms, where short-form videos dominate.Participants are encouraged to leverage contemporary digital marketing techniques, meme culture, and AI tools to maximize video reach and impact. The contest guidelines emphasize the importance of clear messaging, visual appeal, and potential for viral spread.The submitted videos will be reviewed and scored based on predefined metrics by Telegram’s evaluation panel, with winners announced in June 2025. This approach highlights Telegram’s commitment to community-driven content creation as part of its marketing and brand positioning strategy.If successful, the contest could set a precedent for future content initiatives designed to engage users creatively, leveraging social media trends to amplify Telegram’s messaging about innovation and privacy.",Telegram ceo pavel durov launches $50k viral video contest to expose whatsapp’s 'cheap copycat' moves.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has praised the Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) startup DeepSeek’s flagship model, R1, saying that it is the first large language model (LLM) that he’s seen to rival OpenAI’s performance – essentially keeping it on a higher pedestal than Google’s Gemini and the one that powers Grok, the AI chatbot by Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI.“OpenAI has been so far ahead that no one's really come close,” Satya Nadella told Bloomberg Businessweek.“DeepSeek, and R1 in particular, was the first model I’ve seen post some points,” added Nadella.Microsoft began offering R1 through its Azure AI Foundry in January, alongside models from OpenAI, Meta and Mistral. Microsoft VP Asha Sharma said R1 underwent “rigorous red teaming and safety evaluations” before being made available, and emphasized that data processed through Azure would not be routed to DeepSeek’s servers in China.DeepSeek made waves earlier this year when it launched R1, impressing both the tech industry and investors. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the competition, calling R1 “an impressive model” and noting its strong performance at a lower cost. He added that DeepSeek’s emergence prompted OpenAI to accelerate some product releases.Even Google CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged the ‘impressive work’ of DeepSeek's team Alphabet’s Q4 2024 earnings call earlier this year.“I think [DeepSeek has] a tremendous team. I think they've done very, very good work,” Pichai said.R1’s popularity surged in January when its free chatbot app topped Apple’s US App Store, sparking concerns among investors about potential impacts on demand for AI hardware like Nvidia chips. DeepSeek’s ability to deliver high-quality models at a lower price triggered a sell-off in AI-related stocks.However, Ben Buchanan, an AI advisor in the former US President Joe Biden administration, suggested that the hype may be exxagerated and overstated.“DeepSeek’s engineers are extremely talented,” he said on The Ezra Klein Show, adding that their breakthroughs are largely in line with algorithmic efficiency work seen across the industry.","Microsoft ceo satya nadella praises deepseek's flagship model, r1.

Poll Do you agree with Elton John's statement that the UK government is being 'absolute losers' regarding copyright law changes? Yes, I completely agree. No, I disagree.





LONDON: British pop legend Elton John branded the UK government ""absolute losers"" on Sunday over planned copyright law changes that would hand exemptions to tech firms.In a blistering interview broadcast by the BBC, ""Rocket Man"" star John said he felt ""incredibly betrayed"" and accused the government of preparing to ""rob young people of their legacy and their income"".The changes which he branded ""criminal"" would allow tech firms to use creators' content freely unless the rights holders opt out.But John, 78, who has sold over 300 million records worldwide in his decades-long career, said young artists did not have the resources ""to fight big tech"".He said he was not against artificial intelligence (AI) but that when it came to music and creativity a line should be drawn.The government's Data (Use and Access) Bill is currently going through parliament.The parliament's upper house supported an amendment designed to ensure copyright holders would have to give permission over whether their work was used and, in turn, see what elements had been taken, by who and when.But on Wednesday MPs in the lower house, in which the Labour government has a huge majority, voted down the changes.If the government's planned changes to copyright laws went ahead they would be ""committing theft, thievery on a high scale"", John told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme.""The government are just being absolute losers and I'm very angry about it,"" John said, blasting Technology Secretary Peter Kyle as a ""bit of a moron"".Prime Minister Keir Starmer has previously said the government needs to ""get the balance right"" with copyright and AI while noting that the technology represented ""a huge opportunity"".""They have no right to sell us down the river,"" John added, urging Starmer to ""wise up"" and ""see sense"".More than 1,000 musicians including Kate Bush, Annie Lennox and Damon Albarn released a silent album in February to protest at the proposed changes, saying they would legalise music theft.Earlier this month, writers and musicians including John and Bush also condemned the proposals as a ""wholesale giveaway"" to Silicon Valley in a letter to The Times newspaper.Other signatories included musicians Paul McCartney, Ed Sheeran, Dua Lipa and Sting, and writers Kazuo Ishiguro, Michael Morpurgo and Helen Fielding.A Department for Science, Innovation and Technology spokesperson said the bill was focused on ""unlocking the secure and effective use of data for the public interest -- boosting the economy by an estimated £10 billion over the course of the next 10 years"".","Elton john says he feels ""incredibly betrayed"" over planned copyright law changes.

Will subsidised electricity rescue German industry?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/will-subsidised-electricity-rescue-german-industry/articleshow/121297943.cms,"Will subsidised electricity rescue German industry? (IANS)

How high are electricity prices for German industry?





Germany's plan to keep up with US and China

Is this plan a good idea?

The pros and cons of cheaper electricity

Will Brussels thwart Berlin's plan?

'Tailored measures' make more sense





Ahead of February's general election in Germany , the country's industry leaders raised the alarm. They urged the new German government to do something against high electricity prices and warned of business closures and companies relocating abroad if nothing happened.Their concerns appear to have resonated with the new coalition government of the conservative CDU/CSU party alliance and the Social Democrats (SPD) headed by Chancellor Friedrich Merz After only a few weeks in office, it is planning significant relief measures, but some experts are warning of potential downsides.It's hard to pinpoint a single figure, as existing relief from electricity costs varies depending on company size and sector.According to a study by the Bavarian Business Association (vbw) based in Munich, Germany's industrial electricity prices were around the European average in 2022. However, the impact of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 affected energy markets, making year-to-year comparisons difficult.Recent EU data shows that Germany ranks third in the bloc regarding electricity prices for non-household consumers — a category that includes not only industries but also public institutions like schools and government offices, thus making it hard to draw conclusions about the impact on industry specifically.When it comes to the wholesale electricity price — before taxes and fees — Germany is in the middle of international comparisons, said Bruno Burger, energy expert at the Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems, while speaking to the German daily Frankfurter Rundschau recently.One thing is clear, though, companies in the US and China pay significantly less.In 2023, industrial electricity prices were around 7 euro cents (around 8 cents) per kilowatt-hour in the US, according to the German ifo Institute think tank, and about 8 cents in China, vbw data show. In Germany, however, industrial firms pay around 20 cents, ifo says.Plans by the coalition government in Berlin reportedly include broad-based relief measures to reduce industrial electricity prices.In Germany, the electricity price is made up of the wholesale price, plus an electricity tax, surcharges, and grid fees. Grid fees are charges for using the power network, while surcharges fund specific government initiatives.Berlin is now planning to reduce the electricity price by 5 cents per kilowatt-hour for businesses by lowering the electricity tax to the EU minimum and cutting surcharges and grid fees.The government also wants to extend and expand the electricity price compensation program, which reimburses energy-intensive industries for costs arising from CO2 pricing. The CO2 price is applied to the use of fossil fuels in Germany and the EU to discourage emissions.Andreas Fischer, energy and climate policy expert at the Cologne-based German Economic Institute (IW), told DW that ""from the consumer's perspective, the broad-based relief is positive."" Max Jankowsky , CEO of Lössnitz Foundry and president of the Chemnitz Chamber of Industry and Commerce, agrees, telling DW in a statement that the urgency of reducing electricity prices for industry has been ""recognized.""""A blanket reduction in electricity prices contradicts the needs of a system based on renewable energy,"" says Swantje Fiedler , scientific director at the Forum for Ecological-Social Market Economy. Rather, the German energy system would need incentives for energy storage and flexibility, she told DW, because renewable electricity supply is bound to fluctuate, with abundant supply in summer and scarce in winter.“At the same time, it is important to consider how flexible a company can be,” says IW expert Fischer, as not all firms could quickly adapt to changes in electricity supply or pricing.Leonhard Probst , from the Germany-based Fraunhofer Institute for Solar Energy Systems in Freiburg, believes lower electricity prices may reduce incentives for companies to use electricity more efficiently.Probst, who manages the Energy-Charts.de platform — the most comprehensive database for power generation in Germany — also said that, on the other hand, cheaper electricity can make it easier to electrify industrial processes, which is better for the environment in the long run.The Lössnitz Foundry would be such a case in point, as the company's CEO Max Jankowsky has been planning to switch from coke to an electric smelting furnace. So far, however, high power prices are holding him back: ""It feels like running into a buzzsaw,"" he said, referring to the risk of permanently high electricity prices.T he coalition agreement of Germany's ruling parties also mentions further relief for energy-intensive companies. It remains unclear whether this includes capping the wholesale electricity price, though some experts believe that's the intent.As shown in price breakdowns, taxes and surcharges already account for only a small portion of the final electricity cost.Fraunhofer scientist Probst warns that artificially lowering prices could backfire: ""If electricity is in short supply but sold cheaply, scarcity intensifies and prices rise further,"" he argued. Sebastian Bolay , head of energy, environment and industry at the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce (DIHK), sees another problem looming for the government on the horizon.""A price cap would interfere with market pricing and would likely not be permissible under EU state aid rules,"" Bolay told DW.Moreover, a price cap could also be expensive for taxpayers, Probst added, as many companies that don't need relief, because energy costs make up only a small part of their value creation, would ""benefit unnecessarily.""Swantje Fiedler is convinced that a faster rollout of renewable energy in Germany will ""lower prices in the long term.""In the meantime, said Probst, ""targeted subsidies"" are more effective than blanket price reductions, and could include special electricity rates for the use of heat pumps.Jankowsky is also calling for what he called ""tailored measures,"" especially to help small and medium-sized businesses (SME's), noting that many existing subsidies don't apply to them, which must be changed, ""and it needs to happen fast.""","German industry leaders raised the alarm ahead of february's general election.

NEW DELHI: A large-scale communication outage disrupted internet and landline services across Spain on Tuesday, affecting thousands of users and even impacting emergency response systems in multiple regions.According to local media reports, the disruption began early on May 20 and appears to be linked to a network upgrade being carried out by Spanish telecom giant Telefónica. The outage affected customers of Movistar and O2—two major providers under Telefónica—with many users reporting a loss of fibre optic connectivity.The impact was so widespread that emergency services in several communities issued alternative contact numbers, as Spain’s national emergency number '112' was affected. ‘112’ is Spain’s equivalent to the UK’s 999 emergency line.Spanish news outlet El Diario reported that while the network upgrade by Telefónica is the suspected cause of the disruption, it remains unclear whether other internet issues experienced across the country are also directly related to the company's ongoing work.","The disruption began early on may 20 and appears to be linked to a network upgrade being carried out by telefónica.

More than 65,000 holiday listings are to be blocked on Airbnb’s website as per a recent order by the consumer rights ministry of Spain. The Spanish government is increasing its regulatory measures targeting short-term rental companies.This comes amid a raging housing crisis that has led to Spaniards taking to the streets to protest against ever-increasing rental costs. These rising rental and housing costs are generally attributed to the holiday rentals on platforms such as Airbnb that has recently boomed in tourist destinations like Barcelona and Madrid.The ministry on Monday said that out of the 65,935 listings slated to be blocked on Airbnb, most were quite nebulous in terms of ownership as well as licenses.Consumer minister Pablo Bustinduy said, “Enough already with protecting those who make a business out of the right to housing”. Through a spokesperson, Airbnb said that they will appeal the decision but they did not think the ministry was authorized to rule on short-term rentals.According to Airbnb, they had utilized an “indiscriminate methodology” that did not demand licenses to operate for rentals.The Spanish government had made an announcement last year to close down all 10,000 apartments listed as short-term rentals.They had also informed the company about the noncompliant listings months ago.Madrid’s high court has backed the order as 5800 rental listings on Airbnb are to be removed immediately. Two subsequent orders are to be issued till the goal of 66,000 is reached, according to the Spanish government.The growing housing crisis paints a grim picture as hundreds of homeless people have resorted to sleeping in airports. Eurostat had reported that authorities did not provide any assistance to the people sleeping in airports, nor did they kick them out.The situation has worsened due to a political blame game, which has largely overshadowed the actual underlying issue.","More than 65,000 holiday listings are to be blocked on airbnb’s website as per a recent order by the consumer rights ministry of spain.
