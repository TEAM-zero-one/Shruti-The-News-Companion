India Won't Hold Back in Operation Sindoor 2.0: Army Chief Dwivedi Sends Clear Message To Pakistan

NEW DELHI: The Army used artificial intelligence (AI) tools in a big way during Operation Sindoor against Pakistan to generate a common operational picture, intelligence analysis, threat assessment, and predictive modelling and weather forecasting for long-range strikes.“AI was extensively used for multi-sensor data fusion and multi-source data fusion in real time during Operation Sindoor…Overall, 23 apps with specific tasks were used to deal with data and inputs,” director general EME (Electronics and Mechanical Engineers) Lt-General Rajiv Kumar Sahni said on Monday.Asked about China’s huge strides in AI-driven warfare as well as active support to Pakistan during the May 7-10 cross-border hostilities, which included “live” satellite inputs on Indian military deployments, he said the Indian Army was plugged into the “IndiaAI mission” under a “whole of nation approach” as well as collaborating with industry and academia in a big way in the arena.While perceptions about China's AI capabilities exist, the Indian Army is also well-prepared and focused on national security, developing indigenous AI technologies and solutions for use in operations, logistics, autonomous weapon systems and the like, Lt-Gen Sahni added.The senior officer, who was the DG Information Systems during Operation Sindoor, said the ongoing integration of AI into the core functions of the 11.5-lakh strong Army, as part of the overall transformation drive, will bring greater speed, precision and lethality to combat operations.The key AI-driven applications used during Operation Sindoor included the electronic intelligence collation and analysis system (ECAS), a home-grown software upgraded in real time to identify and prioritise critical threats, which helped “achieve strategic dominance”, he said.Then, there was the “Trinetra” system, integrated with “Project Sanjay”, which provided a common operational picture for better coordination, situational awareness, and decision superiority. “AI was also leveraged big time for predictive modelling and weather forecasting tools, which enabled precise planning and targeting for artillery units and long-range vectors. These innovations significantly enhanced the Army’s operational preparedness and response,” he said.Having set up the AI Research and Incubation Centre in Bengaluru in Dec last year, the force is also developing an indigenous “unified AI platform” that will integrate operational, intelligence, logistics, and training applications on a single secure framework. “This will replace fragmented systems and enable validated AI deployment within 24 hours, significantly enhancing operational readiness,” an officer said.The Army is also establishing dedicated AI cells, creating secure cloud-based and edge-computing environments for battlefield applications, and developing AI-enabled autonomous systems such as drones and unmanned vehicles. “We are prioritising AI in domains where it reduces risk to personnel, improves decision-making, and strengthens resilience,” the officer said.","The army used artificial intelligence (ai) tools in a big way during operation sindoor against pakistan.

Klay Thompson shares a subtle Instagram post following a viral press moment



Megan Thee Stallion and Klay Thompson’s romance stays strong



Klay Thompson and Megan Thee Stallion are keeping the spark alive both online and off the court. Just days after the Dallas Mavericks star avoided a question about his romance during Media Day, he surprised fans with a set of intimate photos featuring the Grammy-winning rapper. The post, captioned “THE BEST THING IN LIFE IS LIFE,” offered a glimpse into their easy affection, marking another public show of love from the high-profile couple.The NBA veteran’s Instagram drop came shortly after a now-viral moment during Mavericks Media Day, when a reporter asked how his relationship with Megan Thee Stallion had influenced him “on and off the floor.”Klay Thompson initially appeared confused, repeating, “My relationship with?” before realizing the question’s intent. He quickly shut it down, replying, “I’m not going to talk about that, but I will say every summer hasn’t changed for me. Because I know what it takes to go the distance and there’s really no such thing as an off-season.”The response sparked mixed reactions online— some fans praised his privacy, while others noted the irony of his romantic post appearing so soon after. Still, Thompson’s guarded approach toward the media isn’t new.Known for his calm, introspective nature, the four-time NBA champion has often preferred answering with select words.The couple, who went public over the summer, seems unfazed by public scrutiny. Megan has also shared glimpses of their time together— from golf dates and yacht trips to charity events. Their first red carpet appearance came at Megan’s Pete & Thomas Foundation gala, where the rapper gushed about her boyfriend.""This is my first relationship where I’ve ever been with somebody who’s genuinely a nice person, and he makes me genuinely happy,"" she told Page Six. “I just never dated somebody like him before and I’m just grateful that he’s here by my side and he feels the same way about me.”Despite the media’s curiosity, the pair seems focused on balance. She is preparing for new music releases, and Thompson is for another NBA season. And Thompson’s recent post shows that he is not very comfortable discussing his private romantic life with reporters, but he will certainly celebrate his love with Stallion on social media.Megan Thee Stallion and Klay Thompson quietly made their relationship public in early July 2025, sparking a wave of excitement online. The rapper first dropped a few swimsuit photos by a luxury pool, but fans quickly noticed the real detail— a man relaxing in the background who looked a lot like the Dallas Mavericks star. It didn’t take long before people started connecting the dots. Both Stallion and Thompson often share their sweet moments of togetherness on social media. They have previously shared their golfing and gym moments.Also Read: Klay Thompson and Megan Thee Stallion's combined net worth: Exploring the power couple's career earnings, brand endorsements and more","Klay thompson shares cozy romantic photo with megan thee stallion.

Jake Walman and Edmonton Oilers reach a 7-year agreement, confirmed by Elliotte Friedman



Jake Walman’s journey from Journeyman to Edmonton’s defensive anchor

Jake Walman Season Highlights (2022-2023)

For the Oilers, it has been quite a landmark day to give a real good future a considerable boost. After extending McDavid, the team followed logic with a barrage of headline-type decisions by signing a massive deal with Jake Walman. The technically gifted defenseman, for a handsome amount, has committed for seven years at $49 million to ensure that Edmonton keeps its core intact and competitive. Buzzwords such as Jake Walman contract, Edmonton Oilers extension, and NHL defenseman deal are now taking center stage in sports circles.The initial reports came when Sportsnet insider Elliotte Friedman announced on X that the Oilers were ""closing in on a 7x7M extension with the Pride of Armour Heights, Jake Walman."" Shortly thereafter, it was confirmed by more reliable sources that the deal had indeed been reached and that Walman is now among the top-paid defenders in Edmonton by $7 million of average annual value.It was perfect timing. Since joining the Oilers from the San Jose Sharks at the 2025 NHL Trade Deadline, Walman has demonstrated he's worth every dime. He is smooth skating, playing good defense, and transitioning play; that made him a reliable presence on the back end—the very thing the Oilers were needing as they continued rearranging their roster with a view to another playoff push.Jake Walman's road to Edmonton has been a steady climb fueled by uncompromising determination and adaptability. Drafted by the Blues in 2014, he spent several long seasons developing in college and the AHL before grabbing hold of his full-time NHL gig. It was with Detroit where he truly bloomed – a top-four defensive steak-with-protein kind of player- a three-year extension on his contract.In 2024, Detroit traded Walman to San Jose, where he had a coming-out party offensively with 32 points in 50 games. Edmonton took notice, and the following year traded a 2026 first-rounder and forward Carl Berglund to the Sharks. The Oilers became an immediate landing spot for Walman, as he scored eight points in 15 games; he really showed up in the playoffs with another 10 points. Walman was an easy choice for Edmonton’s long-term plans owing to his overall game and composure in clutch situations.A long-term contract extension for Jake Walman underpins deeper and more stable defence for the Edmonton Oilers for years to come. This move, along with McDavid's renewal, further signifies the franchise's commitment to enduring success — a future based on trust, talent, and timing.Also Read: Connor McDavid's future sparks buzz as Elliotte Friedman hints at clarity before NHL season","Jake walman and edmonton oilers reach a 7-year agreement, confirmed by elliotte friedman.

At just 30 years old, Lucy Guo has joined the ranks of billionaire college dropouts like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, amassing a $1.25 billion net worth, according to Forbes. Guo’s meteoric rise came after her first company, Scale AI, was acquired by Meta in a deal valuing the AI data labeling firm at $29 billion, CNBC reported. Guo, now the founder of Passes, a content creator monetization platform launched in 2022, shared with 'CNBC Make It' that she veered from the traditional path of higher education. After studying computer science and human-computer interaction at Carnegie Mellon University, Guo left the program just two years in, with only one year and eight classes left to graduate. The decision stunned her Chinese immigrant parents.“They sacrificed everything to immigrate from China to America to give their kids a better future,” Guo told CNBC Make It. “For their kids to suddenly let go of their education when they were almost done was like a slap in the face.” “I think they [parents] viewed that as a sign that I didn’t love them, and they weren’t very happy with it, when it was just me making a bet on myself and choosing to optimize for what I thought would be a better future for myself,” she said.Instead of finishing her degree, Guo pursued the Thiel Fellowship, a program by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel that awards $200,000 to young entrepreneurs to build innovative companies. “I think [my parents] viewed that as a sign that I didn’t love them,” Guo said. “It was just me making a bet on myself and choosing to optimize for what I thought would be a better future.” Despite her unconventional path, Guo sees value in college for its networking opportunities.“One to two years in college is actually just incredibly great because you’re going to make the best friends in college, and you’re going to meet the smartest people,” she told CNBC Make It. “There’s no other scenario where there’s such a high concentration of smart people who are also looking to make friends.”Guo noted that unlike workplaces or social events, where people may already have established circles, college offers a unique environment for building lifelong connections. Her story underscores a growing trend of entrepreneurs prioritizing real-world experience over traditional education, while still recognizing the social benefits of a campus environment.","Lucy guo, 30, is the founder of passes, a content creator monetization platform.

Apple CEO Tim Cook paid a heartfelt tribute to Steve Jobs on his death anniversary. Sharing a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Cook wrote: “Steve saw the future as a bright and boundless place, lit the path forward, and inspired us to follow. We miss you, my friend.” For those unaware, Jobs died on October 5, 2011 after 8 eight years of battling pancreatic cancer. Tim Cook’s post caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk who reposted it on his timeline.Steve Jobs co-founded Apple in 1976 alongside Steve Wozniak. During his leadership, Apple launched groundbreaking products like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, reshaping entire industries and redefining the way people communicate, work, and consume entertainment.Renowned for his focus on design and user experience, Jobs was instrumental in making technology simpler and more accessible. His vision not only revived Apple from the brink of collapse but also propelled it into becoming one of the most valuable and influential companies in the world.When Steve Jobs was battling severe health issues in the late 2000s, Apple’s then–Chief Operating Officer Tim Cook made a deeply personal gesture.Cook offered to donate a part of his liver to Jobs, since both shared the same rare blood type.According to accounts later revealed in Tim Cook’s biography and media reports, the Apple executive underwent extensive medical testing and found that he was indeed a suitable donor. However, Jobs firmly declined the offer.Cook recalled that Jobs became emotional but quickly dismissed the idea, telling him: “I’ll never let you do that. I’ll never do that.” Jobs, who was known for his uncompromising principles and independent spirit, made it clear he would not accept such a sacrifice from a colleague and friend.This episode highlighted both Cook’s deep loyalty to Jobs and the unique bond the two shared during Apple’s most transformative years. While Jobs continued to struggle with his health, he refused to let anyone else bear the risks of a major procedure on his behalf.Jobs eventually underwent a liver transplant in 2009, performed by a medical team in Tennessee, but not with Cook as a donor. He returned to lead Apple after the surgery, but his health continued to decline until his passing in October 2011.","Apple ceo tim cook paid a heartfelt tribute to steve jobs on his death anniversary.

Full text of Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu’s post

Arattai is on the surface a simple product but it has a lot of depth inside.

Let me list the engineering frameworks (all homegrown) that power Arattai.

First is what we call our messaging/AV framework. This has been the ""real time"" workhorse of Zoho for a while and this is what offers you those crisp calls and meetings that connect quickly. It has been perfected for 15 years.

Then we have a distributed framework that allows us to distribute the workload among many servers and databases, and provides fault tolerance, performance monitoring, security and so on. This is the backbone of Zoho and powers a lot of what you see on the surface and also keeps our systems secure. We have been perfecting this for over 20 years now!

We have teams actively working on these frameworks and they provide strong support to the Arattai team.

Our staying power comes from the depth of all the R&D we do. Recently I have moved full time to R&D and you will see many more innovations from us.





Zoho founder and former CEO Sridhar Vembu recently said that being a dedicated engineer is like being a Rishi. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Vembu highlighted that the company’s recently launched messaging platform – Arattai may see a “simple product” on the surface, but “has a lot of depth inside”. Praising the Arattai team, he wrote “all of you have worked hard for over 5 years without expecting that the product would ever take off.” “Allow neither praise nor criticism nor fame to distract you, resolutely stay the course,” Vembu added.In the post, he also shed light on the engineering framework that power Arattai.

“the more connected and accessible you are, the less productive you are.”





Telegram CEO Pavel Durov begins his day without checking his phone. This is because he views the device as a distraction that can prevent people from forming their own ideas. On a recent episode of the Lex Fridman podcast, Durov said he tries to limit his phone usage, explaining that he doesn't want other people telling him what to think. Durov's discipline regarding his phone is part of a broader routine aimed at maximising mental clarity. He revealed that he allocates 11 to 12 hours for sleep, often spending part of that time with his mind racing, as he finds that brilliant ideas come to him during these extended rest periods. Fridman, the podcast host, also noted that he spent two weeks with Durov and never saw him use his phone for social media as most people do.In the podcast, Durov said:However, Durov acknowledged the need to stay connected while maintaining balance, as his career has been built on apps that promote smartphone use. He noted:Durov has also been vocal about his views on technology and data privacy.In August, he said he’d “rather die” than give third parties access to Telegram messages.He has become a central figure in the ongoing tension between social media platforms and governments.

Poll Do you believe the Taliban's suspension of internet services is justified? Yes, to prevent immorality No, it's an infringement on rights





The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service, following weeks of cutting fibre-optic internet connections in different provinces.According to internet watchdog NetBlocks, the country is experiencing a ""total internet blackout."" The group reported that the disruption appears to be the most extensive and coordinated shutdown of telecom services in Afghanistan since the Taliban regained control in 2021. The blackout has raised concerns about the return of earlier restrictions from the Taliban’s first rule, when they banned television, satellite dishes, and other forms of mass communication in what they described as a campaign against immorality.The government had already started reducing high-speed internet access in some provinces earlier this month. Officials said this was done to prevent ""vice,"" following orders from the Taliban’s supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada.By Monday night, mobile phone signals and internet access steadily weakened across the country until overall connectivity dropped to less than one percent of normal activity, NetBlocks reported.It is the first time since the Taliban seized power in 2021, after years of insurgency, that communication services across the nation have been cut off. Since then, the group has enforced a strict version of Islamic law and imposed several restrictions.Residents expressed concern over the impact of the blackout on daily life and business. ""We are blind without phones and internet,"" Najibullah, a 42-year-old shopkeeper in Kabul, was quoted as saying by the news agency AFP. ""All our business relies on mobiles. The deliveries are with mobiles. It's like a holiday, everyone is at home. The market is totally frozen.""The Taliban have not issued an official explanation for the nationwide suspension. A government official, however, said that “eight to nine thousand telecommunications pillars” would be switched off and added that the blackout would remain in place “until further notice.”Just last year, in 2024, the Taliban had described Afghanistan’s fibre-optic project as a key priority. The 9,350-kilometre (5,800-mile) network, developed mostly during governments backed by the United States, was promoted as a way to connect the country with the outside world and support economic recovery.Earlier in September, Taliban representatives warned that they planned to cut off internet access nationwide “to prevent immoral activities.” They did not specify what was considered immoral under their order.Haji Zaid, the governor of Balkh province, said in a statement that ""an alternative system will be established within the country for essential needs."" He did not clarify what this system would include or how it would function.","The taliban government in afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service.

Defence, investment, and the new space race





Europe’s space ambitions are at a critical juncture, according to Bernard Liautaud, managing partner at Balderton Capital. Speaking at the Italian Tech Week event, Liautaud warned that the continent risks falling behind in the rapidly expanding space and defence sectors due to an excessive dependence on American companies, particularly Elon Musk’s SpaceX . While European start-ups have made notable advances in satellite technology and defence innovation, SpaceX’s dominance in launch services and communications infrastructure poses a “huge risk” to Europe’s technological sovereignty and national security. Liautaud urged governments to accelerate investment in domestic capabilities and nurture home-grown innovation to strengthen Europe’s position in the global space race.Liautaud cautioned that European nations remain overly reliant on American firms for satellite launches and space-based infrastructure. SpaceX, now valued at around $400 billion (£315 billion), dominates both the commercial launch market and the communications satellite sector, a dependency he described as strategically dangerous. “We need to be more self-sufficient,” he said, underlining that control over space technology is becoming a decisive factor in military and economic strength. Despite US dominance, Europe’s start-up ecosystem is showing promising growth. Liautaud argued that supporting such enterprises is essential for Europe’s strategic autonomy, calling start-ups “a key ingredient” in the effort to achieve technological sovereignty.European investment in defence and aerospace technology has surged since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, driving the emergence of new firms specialising in drones, battlefield software, and orbital infrastructure. Liautaud stressed that space-based capabilities are now integral to both military supremacy and global competitiveness. By cultivating independent launch systems and communications networks, Europe can reduce its exposure to foreign political and commercial pressures.Industry leaders share Liautaud’s concern. Hélène Huby, founder of The Exploration Company and a former Airbus executive, described Europe as “quite weak right now regarding space-based infrastructure.” With US giants like SpaceX and Blue Origin racing ahead, the window for Europe to build independent capabilities is rapidly closing. “We must act now,” Liautaud urged, framing Europe’s challenge not merely as a question of innovation but of strategic survival in the new era of space competition.","Europe’s space ambitions are at a critical juncture, according to bernard liautaud, managing partner at balderton capital.

China's K visa faces online backlash: Locals vent on Weibo; here's why,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinas-k-visa-faces-online-backlash-locals-vent-on-weibo-heres-why/articleshow/124309445.cms,"Representational photo

What is K Visa





China’s new K visa for foreign professionals is facing criticism on social media even before it comes into effect. Netizens have raised concerns over its timing, fairness, and potential impact on domestic employment.Originally scheduled to launch on October 1, the visa’s rollout has been delayed as Chinese embassies abroad remain closed until October 8 for National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival holidays.The K visa, described as China’s version of the H-1B, was announced in August but gained attention only after US president Donald Trump highlighted the USD 1,00,000 fee for H-1B visas, which mainly benefit Indian professionals.Critics pointed to China’s high unemployment, estimated at around 19 per cent over the past two years, and the pressure of 12 million new graduates entering the job market each year. Many questioned the policy favouring foreign STEM graduates over domestic talent.Concerns were also raised over the lack of employer sponsorship, which could increase the risk of fraud and low-quality applications.One Weibo user wrote: “It is already hard to verify domestic degrees. With the K visa, agencies may exploit the system to help foreigners get visas. How will each application be properly vetted?”Others asked why foreign bachelor’s degree holders are treated as ‘tech talent’ while young Chinese graduates struggle to find jobs and often pursue master’s degrees.Some suggested that a master’s degree should be the minimum requirement for K visa applicants.The newly introduced K visa, announced in August, aims to attract young international STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) graduates by offering entry, residency and work authorisation without requiring any prior work offer.According to Xinhua, the K visa will offer longer validity, multiple entries, and extended stay periods compared to China’s 12 existing visa types. Holders can engage in education, culture, science and technology exchanges, as well as entrepreneurial and business activities.","The k visa, described as china’s version of the h-1b, was announced in august.

"Bitcoin reaches all-time high! Largest crypto surpasses $125,000 mark; 'debasement’ trade spurs risk rally",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/bitcoin-reaches-all-time-high-largest-crypto-surpasses-125000-mark-debasement-trade-spurs-risk-rally/articleshow/124317019.cms,"



Bitcoin soared to a new all-time high on Sunday, breaking past the $125,000 mark as safe-haven demand surged.The world’s largest cryptocurrency reached $125,689 in Asia, driven by investor concerns over the US government shutdown. The cryptocurrency smashed its previous record of $124,514 set on August 14, boosted by gains in US stocks and fresh inflows into Bitcoin-linked exchange-traded funds.Investors believe that the government shutdown, which began on Wednesday, could push money into safe-haven assets, a trend market participants are calling the “debasement trade.”“With many assets including equities, gold and even collectibles like Pokemon cards hitting all time highs, it’s no surprise Bitcoin is benefitting from the dollar debasement narrative,” Joshua Lim, co-head of markets at crypto prime brokerage firm FalconX told Bloomberg.October is traditionally a strong month for Bitcoin, often referred to as “Uptober,” with the token gaining in nine of the past ten years. The surge this year has lifted Bitcoin’s value by more than 30%.The rise has also been fuelled by growing corporate adoption. Public companies, led by Michael Saylor’s Strategy, have been stockpiling Bitcoin, a move that has inspired other firms and even boosted interest in smaller digital assets like Ether.US equities hit record highs on Friday, driven by major artificial intelligence deals and partnerships, easing concerns about a prolonged shutdown and weak business activity.Meanwhile, treasuries and the dollar fell, and gold was on track for a seventh consecutive weekly gain, supported by central bank buying amid low interest rates and persistent inflation worries.“The shutdown matters this time around,” said Geoff Kendrick, global head of digital assets research at Standard Chartered Plc, as quoted by Bloomberg.He added that Bitcoin is likely to rise during this period and noted that the cryptocurrency was “in a different place” during the previous shutdown in 2018-2019, when it did not move in line with traditional risk assets.","Bitcoin smashed its previous record of $124,514 set on august 14.
