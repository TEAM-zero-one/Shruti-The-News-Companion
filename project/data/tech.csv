‘India reliable’: PM woos global investors at chip plant launch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-reliable-pm-woos-global-investors-at-chip-plant-launch/articleshow/128903959.cms,"‘Historic’: US Envoy Gor Hails Micron’s Chip Plant Launch In Guj, Cites Modi-Trump Friendship

AHMEDABAD: Amid intensifying geopolitical conflicts and trade tensions, Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a strong pitch on Saturday for India as a preferred investment destination.“India is capable, India is competitive, and India is committed. Today, India has only one message for investors worldwide: India is ready, India is reliable, and India will deliver,” Modi said.Speaking after inaugurating US-based chip giant Micron Technology’s ATMP (Assembly, Testing, Marking and Packaging) plant at Sanand, the first such facility in the country, Modi said Gujarat would provide the lifestyle and social life that international companies desire.“A small town (Sanand) suddenly found its place on the global map. Development and systems are needed; perhaps even today you may have thoughts like, ‘It would be nice if this were there, it would be nice if that were there.’ I assure you, friends, the lifestyle you desire, the social life you desire, the way you live your life, Gujarat will create that too. We will not let you feel anything is lacking.” He said after establishing itself as a software powerhouse, the country is “firmly establishing its identity” in the hardware sector too.The PM said that until 10-11 years ago, discussions about data and chips in India were confined to very close circles, and these often revolved only around IT services.Speaking about the speed of project approvals, he said, “Today’s India is moving forward with this approach — from policy to production. It is visible. Remember, the MoU for this facility was signed in June 2023. Subsequently, the groundbreaking for this facility took place in Sept 2023 in Sanand. In Feb 2024, machines began to be installed in the pilot facility, and today, in Feb 2025, commercial production has begun at this facility. Anyone who follows this sector can understand the meaning of this speed.”Referring to the start of commercial production at Micron’s ATMP facility, he said it would strengthen India’s role in the global technology value chain. The ATMP facility will manufacture SSD (solid state drive) storage devices as well as RAM-type DRAM and NAND products, a govt release said. The company has invested Rs 22,516 crore in its Sanand plant. “The AI Summit introduced the world to India’s vision. This year is yet another proof of India’s commitment to technology leadership. Today, India is rapidly becoming a part of the global semiconductor value chain,” he said. “This is the century of the AI revolution, and semiconductors are the bridge to this change. If oil was the regulator of the last century, the microchip will be the regulator of this century. India decided to move forward rapidly in the semiconductor sector,” the PM said.India is rapidly becoming an integral part of the global semiconductor value chain, and the entire world wants to secure the supply chains for both these technologies, he said. “The two largest democracies — India and the US — are continuously striving for this,” the PM said, adding their collective effort will also make the global supply chain of critical minerals more secure and reliable.","Prime minister narendra modi made a strong pitch on saturday for india as a preferred investment destination.

Have you noticed in the last five to eight years' time, suddenly you present the Indian passport, people are looking at you little more respectfully than they used to ten years ago? That's brand building.India has built its brand consciously. And it's good. Is it enough? No. They have to build the brand much bigger.

That must happen.""He also spoke about branding in the context of yoga, saying, “Branding is a part of impactfulness…. Well, yoga is a grand example of that - for what it is, the spectacular level of impact that it has on people and the efficacy of how it works. Literally everybody in the world should be on it. But bad branding for a long time! We are trying to change the branding for which I am accused of in various ways. Because something that has that level of efficacy and such a spectacular impact on human life, most human beings don't even know what it is. ”The Brand INSIGHT programme, launched in 2023 and currently in its sixth edition, focuses on branding strategies, positioning and creative excellence through workshops and case studies.

Government approach to AI adoption

Education as the long-term lever

The UK Transformation Dialogues 2026, conducted by The Times of India in Dehradun, spotlighted artificial intelligence's role in infrastructure expansion and education reform as key pillars of Uttarakhand’s next phase of growth.The panel discussion on “Building the Growth Engine: Infrastructure, Education & AI-Led Investment” brought together Mayank, Founder, CEO & Managing Director of ADROSONIC; Shikhar Saxena, Additional Director, Department of Industries, Government of Uttarakhand; and Prof Dr Sachin Ghai of Graphic Era University to deliberate on how the state can leverage technology and partnerships to drive sector-led development.The UK Transformation Dialogues 2026 is designed as a strategic platform to examine Uttarakhand’s shift from terrain-bound limitations to sector-driven growth. The forum convenes policymakers, industry leaders and domain experts to explore progress across infrastructure, education, tourism, healthcare, women empowerment and grassroots enterprise, with a focus on sustainable and inclusive development.Detailing the structural framework of artificial intelligence, ADROSONIC founder Mayank said AI must be understood beyond just end-user applications.He outlined five layers of AI — infrastructure (chips and computing power), data quality, models (the “brain” of AI where companies such as OpenAI operate), orchestration (enabling multiple actions from a single query), and applications, where users interact directly with AI systems.“If your data quality is not good, you can’t have AI on top of it. If we feed it wrong data, AI will always give a wrong response,” he said, stressing that data quality is very important for accurate outcome.Highlighting Uttarakhand’s talent pool, he said nurturing skilled professionals and building smaller innovation hubs could enable the state to offer AI-driven services globally despite geographical constraints.“We have an enormous amount of talent. If we nurture this talent and build small hubs, we can provide services anywhere in the world using the power of AI — and that itself will fuel the growth of the entire state,” he said.He further suggested that if private institutions and the government join hands, they can share their respective challenges, enabling universities to undertake research and then organisations aid in arriving at practical solutions.However, he cautioned that technology must be applied meaningfully. “No matter how cool a technology is, until you find how it’s going to be applied, it’s of no use.”He also explained significance of tech saying with relations to businesses saying, ""Technology is for the business, business is not for the technology.""The additional director, department of industries, Uttarakhand government, Shikhar Saxena acknowledged that governments have historically been slow in adopting new technologies, citing delayed use of computers and specialised software in earlier decades; but are now moving faster.“Whenever some new technology comes, government is usually the last to use it,” he said. However he noted the relatively faster speed recently, as in 2015 many processes were still offline, though they now been digitised.While the Uttarakhand government is not yet fully deploying AI across departments, he said the state intends to move faster this time. Referring to the launch of the Uttarakhand AI Mission on November 26, Saxena said the government aims to take a ""first-mover advantage"".For infrastructure bodies such as the Uttarakhand Infrastructure and Industrial Development Board (UIIDB), AI adoption is expected to be more proactive, he added.“Saxena further highlighted a key problem in govts which he belives can be solved by AI. ""Understaffing is a chronic problem in almost all government departments. AI can help solve this problem, and that’s why we are focusing a lot on it,” he said.Graphic Era University professor Dr Sachin Ghai emphasised talked about technology-led growth through changes in curriculum and institutional thinking.Recalling that one of Uttarakhand’s earlier challenges was the outmigration of students seeking higher education outside the state, he said expanding quality institutions within Uttarakhand was a crucial step.Talking about one aspect he said, “We recognised the importance of participation of all stakeholders,”, adding that education should “always enlighten and empower.”Investment in infrastructure, he stressed, must be matched by investment in people and partnerships, with academia, industry and government working together to build a resilient growth engine for the state.","The uk transformation dialogues 2026 is designed to examine uttarakhand’s shift from terrain-bound limitations to sector-driven growth.

Public reasoning has increased in the digital era

Labels , ideology and the Left–Right debate

Popularity versus truth in public discourse

On corruption and selective narratives

Digital media, misinformation and bias

Uttarakhand ’s growth and structural challenges

Digital governance and the role of critics

NEW DELHI: The Times of India’s flagship Uttarakhand Transformation Dialogues 2026 brought together policymakers, academics and industry leaders in Dehradun on Friday, with a sharp focus on the state’s next phase of growth.Among the key sessions was a fireside chat featuring scientist and author Anand Ranganathan, who spoke on the theme “Digital Education, Governance & Public Reason”.The session explored how digital platforms, education and governance shape public discourse and policy outcomes.The larger event, organised by The Times of India, aims to create collaboration between government, industry and civil society.Opening the discussion, the moderator asked whether the scope of public reasoning in society has grown or shrunk in the digital age.Ranganathan was clear in his response.“It has certainly increased. There is no two ways about it,” he said.Recalling the 1970s and 1980s, he noted that earlier generations had very limited avenues to respond to opinions published in newspapers or aired on radio and television.“If we didn’t like it, the only option was to roll up the newspaper and fling it against the wall. On rare occasions, you would write a letter to the editor.I had one published once,” he said, adding that there was a sense of frustration in not being heard.In contrast, he described today’s environment as a “problem of plenty”, where people have multiple platforms to voice their views. While acknowledging that extremes can be disruptive, he said he would prefer a noisy democracy over enforced silence.The conversation then moved to whether society is becoming overly opinionated, forming views before facts.Ranganathan argued that political labels are often imposed rather than clearly defined. In the Indian context, he said, Western definitions of Left and Right do not neatly apply.“In India, one can perhaps define the Left, but it’s very difficult to define the Right. In fact, in many domains, I consider the BJP a left-wing party, economically, it is certainly left-wing,” he remarked.He added that labels can sometimes simplify arguments by giving people a sense of belonging to an ideological group. “It’s convenient,” he said, noting that he has learnt to accept such labels in “the right spirit”.Asked whether he faces pressure to adopt popular positions rather than factual ones, Ranganathan said he has consistently relied on a scientific approach since he began writing and appearing in public debates in 2008.“I have always looked at everything through the lens of science. If you do that, you can never go wrong,” he said.He admitted that public reactions often fluctuate. “People love what I say when it conforms to their thinking. The next day, they troll me because I’ve said something they disagree with. That happens almost every day.”Referring to debates around textbook references to judicial corruption, Ranganathan argued that institutions should not be shielded from scrutiny.“Is there corruption in the judiciary? It’s not me saying it, former Chief Justices have acknowledged it,” he said, adding that if students are being educated about institutions, they should understand the “full picture”.However, he cautioned against selective criticism. “If you talk about corruption, talk about it everywhere. Don’t be selective,” he said, pointing out that corruption is discussed in politics, science, medicine and sports.He also criticised what he described as a tendency in the media to portray current problems as unprecedented.“Science teaches you to ask, has this happened before? Look at the data before drawing conclusions,” he said, urging comparisons across states and over time before assigning blame.On the role of digital media in spreading both information and misinformation, Ranganathan said eliminating misinformation entirely is unrealistic.“You can’t eliminate misinformation entirely. It happens naturally,” he said.He argued that exposure to diverse viewpoints is the best corrective. Drawing an example from children of civil servants who move across states and encounter different narratives, he said, such mobility often gives them a more balanced understanding.“The only way to circumvent bias is to know the other opinion. Always read two newspapers,” he advised.He described disagreement as healthy. “You and I have agreed on some issues and disagreed on others. I see that as diversity, not difference. The listener benefits by hearing both sides. That is the democratisation digital media has given us.”Turning specifically to Uttarakhand, Ranganathan presented a mix of achievements and concerns.He said the state’s GDP per capita is about $1,000 higher than the national average. Welfare schemes, including toilets, bank accounts, tap water connections and Ayushman cards, have reached nearly 100% of the targeted population.However, he stressed that long-term planning is crucial. “This is a golden opportunity to draw a roadmap, not for five years, because governments come and go, but for 15 to 20 years,” he said.Highlighting what he termed a “problem of plenty”, he noted that while Uttarakhand’s population is around one million, tourist arrivals are about 6.5 million.“Everything has a flip side,” he said.He pointed out that 80% of the state still depends on agriculture, yet in the past 15 years, about 28% of cultivable land has been lost, largely due to construction, urbanisation and tourism. Agricultural produce availability has declined by around 15%.“You are facing a situation where one sector is doing extremely well — but structural balance must be maintained,” he cautioned.On governance, Ranganathan observed that merely providing digital information is not enough.“You can provide all the digital information you want. But digital information is not interactive. You tend to pick solutions from those who praise you. Critics are often pushed aside,” he said, underlining the need for inclusive dialogue.The Uttarakhand Transformation Dialogues also featured sessions with various famous personalities, focusing on culture, gender and heritage as drivers of growth.","The times of india’s flagship uttarakhand transformation dialogues 2026 brought together policymakers, academics and industry leaders in dehradun.

Economic and geopolitical impacts

Reactions on social media platforms

The world may be on the brink of a major disruption caused by artificial intelligence, according to Dario Amodei, the chief executive officer of Anthropic, a leading AI company. In a recent interview, Amodei described the rapid evolution of AI systems as an “AI tsunami” that is approaching society faster than most people realise. He said that AI is getting closer to being able to do things that people can do faster than expected, but most of the world is still not ready for what that means. There is a lot of talk right now about how AI could change jobs, industries, the economy, and the balance of power in the world. People are paying attention to Amodei's comments because they suggest that both public knowledge and rules may not be keeping up with new technologies. The comments also show that people in the AI research community are very worried about how fast and how much innovation will change things.According to Amodei, society is at a moment where powerful AI systems are moving beyond simple tasks and are beginning to perform complex functions once thought to require deep human intelligence. In an interview on a podcast with entrepreneur Nikhil Kamath, he said the world must recognise the large-scale changes ahead, rather than dismissing them as insignificant.He used the term “tsunami” to describe AI’s rapid rise, adding that many still treat it as “just a trick of the light. ”Amodei explained that automation is already affecting technical areas such as coding, mathematics, and scientific research. He said that AI models are increasingly handling routine and specialised work previously done by humans, potentially leading to major shifts in labour markets and business models.The CEO said that the rise of advanced AI systems could have big effects on the economy and the world as a whole. He said that the spread of technology won't be limited to one industry or sector; it could also affect jobs, global markets, and competition between countries. AI investments and tools are already influencing stock prices and investor behaviour, with some financial commentators dubbing recent market reactions the “Claude Crash,” after Anthropic’s Claude models, which are competitors to other major AI systems.Amodei said that while human-centred jobs that require empathy and interpersonal skills may persist longer, roles involving repetitive or structured cognitive tasks are likely to change first. He noted that coding may be one of the earliest areas where AI takes on a significant share of the work.People on tech forums and in online communities have been talking about what Amodei said. People on Reddit agreed with some of his warnings, saying that AI could have huge effects on the economy that would affect not just tech jobs but also many other areas, including healthcare, education, and manufacturing. Some said that investors and markets are very worried because companies and workers are trying to figure out how AI will change their fields and daily operations.The comparison to a tsunami shows how quickly and on a large scale some people think AI could grow. Even though the term is a metaphor, it shows that many people and organisations may not fully understand how quickly things are changing, or the long-term consequences it could bring.","Dario amodei, ceo of leading ai company anthropic, said the world may be on the brink of a major disruption caused by artificial intelligence.

Netflix Drops A $72b Bombshell On Hollywood With Mega Warner Bros Discovery Move | WHAT IT MEANS

David Zaslav’s farewell message

The long-running battle between Paramount and Netflix over Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) has now taken a decisive turn. The WBD’s board deemed Paramount Skydance’s revised bid of $31 per share, all cash as superior to Netflix’s earlier offer of $27.75 per share for WBD’s studio and streaming assets. Paramount’s proposal covers the entirety of WBD, including pay-TV networks such as CNN, TBS, and TBT, and includes a $7 billion breakup fee to safeguard against regulatory hurdles.According to a report by CNBC, Netflix which had granted WBD a seven-day waiver to reopen talks with Paramount, chose not to revise its bid. In a joint statement, co-CEOs Ted Sarandos and Greg Peters said: “At the price required to match Paramount Skydance’s latest offer, the deal is no longer financially attractive, so we are declining to match.” They emphasized that while Netflix believed it could have been a strong steward of Warner Bros. ’ iconic brands, the transaction was always a “nice to have” rather than a “must have.”WBD CEO David Zaslav has also acknowledged Netflix’s role on the process, saying: “Netflix is a great company and throughout this process Ted, Greg, Spence and everyone there have been extraordinary partners to us. We wish them well in the future.”He added that once the board votes to adopt the Paramount merger agreement, it will create “tremendous value” for shareholders and usher in a new era of collaboration between Paramount Skydance and WBD.The market responded swiftly: Netflix shares jumped 10% in extended trading, Paramount gained 5%, while WBD fell 2%. Analysts noted that Netflix’s disciplined approach avoided overpaying, while Paramount’s aggressive bid underscored its determination to consolidate its position in the media landscape.","Paramount skydance's revised bid of $31 per share, all cash, deemed superior to netflix’s earlier offer of $27.75 per share.

Narayana Murthy highlights which jobs AI is likely to replace first



Why is the warning directed at young professionals



How AI is already affecting jobs



Skills that may remain important in an AI-driven workplace



Artificial intelligence has become one of the most discussed topics in India’s job and technology landscape, especially as automation tools are being adopted in offices, factories, and on digital platforms. At a time when concerns about work culture, productivity, and employment security are already in focus, fresh comments from Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy have drawn attention. In a recent interview with Moneycontrol, Murthy spoke about the growing impact of artificial intelligence on jobs and skills, particularly for young people entering the workforce. His remarks come months after his comments on long working hours triggered widespread discussion. This time, the focus was on how quickly AI is moving forward and how it might change the way people work. The interview brought out his thoughts on being ready, learning new skills, and how young professionals should deal with a job market that is changing quickly because of new technologies.Murthy said in the interview that artificial intelligence is moving quickly and could take over some jobs sooner than most people think.He said that jobs that involve doing the same thing over and over or following a set pattern are more likely to be the first to be affected. According to him, AI systems are already capable of handling work that once required human intervention, especially in areas such as data processing, routine coding, and basic analysis.Murthy stated that this shift would not happen overnight but would gradually change how companies operate and hire. He noted that young professionals need to be aware of these changes early in their careers.Murthy’s comments focused largely on students and early-career workers. He said younger employees should understand that relying only on traditional degrees or narrow technical skills may not be enough in the long run. As AI tools get better, businesses may expect their employees to be able to solve more complex problems and know more about their field.The interview made it clear that being able to adapt and learn new things will be more and more important. Murthy said that young people who keep learning new things are more likely to stay useful as technology changes.AI is already being used in many fields, including finance, healthcare, information technology, and manufacturing. AI-powered tools are answering customer service questions, writing software code, looking at financial data, and keeping track of supply chains.Technology news often cites industry reports that say companies are spending money on AI to make things run more smoothly and save money. This has made people worried about losing their jobs, especially in entry-level and routine positions. Murthy's comments fit with these changes, as he said that AI would change the way people work instead of getting rid of all jobs.Murthy said in the interview that skills like creativity, critical thinking, leadership, and decision-making are less likely to be done by machines. He said that people would still need to be involved in jobs that require understanding how people act, managing teams, or making tough decisions.He also mentioned that professionals who combine technical knowledge with real-world understanding could find more opportunities. This includes those who can work alongside AI systems rather than compete with them.","Narayana murthy spoke about the growing impact of artificial intelligence on jobs and skills, particularly for young people entering the workforce.

What Phoebe Gates said about funding from Bill and Melinda Gates

“I have a chip on my shoulder,”

“From my dad, I’ve really learned that your team is the core of what you’re building. You can’t do anything without an incredible team,”

“I’ve entered the startup world again.”

“When your daughter asks if you’d be willing to work a shift in customer service at her startup, the only right answer is yes. I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how technology can make systems more efficient, equitable, and accessible. But I’ve learned over the years that the best way to understand how something works, or where it breaks, is to go straight to the people using it.

Bill Gates Admits 'HUGE Mistake' With Epstein In PRIVATE Staff Meetings | WATCH

Phoebe Gates regularly asks candidates one question during interviews. The co-CEO of the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered shopping assistant Phia has revealed that she asks this question to candidates during interviews for roles at her startup. The youngest daughter of Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and philanthropist Melinda French Gates said that this question helps her to understand how applicants approach problem-solving rather than testing their factual knowledge.Speaking on the Opening Bid Unfiltered podcast with Yahoo Finance, Gates said,She added that the question is being asked across departments.Phobe noted,Gates said the goal is not to check whether candidates know the correct figure but to evaluate “how someone goes through a logical approach to solving that question.”As Phia expands, Phoebe Gates said she uses additional questions during the hiring process.When interviewing sales candidates, she asks about the “craziest” thing they have done to close a deal.she said.The 23-year-old recently raised $35 million in Series A funding for Phia, the AI shopping agent she co-founded in April 2025 with her Stanford University roommate, Sophia Kianni. Since launch, the startup has attracted more than 1 million users and reported an elevenfold increase in revenue. The company is currently valued at about $185 million.Phia is a mobile app and browser extension designed to help shoppers reduce spending by displaying resale and secondhand alternatives to the products they are browsing.Gates also noted that Phia has not taken funding from her parents, saying,during the same podcast. She added that one of the key lessons she has learned from her parents is how to build strong teams.she added.Instead of investing financially in the venture, Bill Gates has contributed his time and experience to support his daughter’s startup. Shortly after the company’s launch in 2025, the tech billionaire shared on LinkedIn that he was assisting the team with customer service efforts in the early stages. Announcing his involvement with Phia, Gates wrote:Bill Gates wrote in a LinkedIn post last year.","The 23-year-old recently raised $35 million in series a funding for phia, the ai shopping agent she co-founded in april 2025 with her stanford university roommate, sophia kianni.

How the GTA V promotion works



February 19 to February 25 — GTA$500,000

February 26 to March 4 — GTA$500,000

March 5 to March 11 — GTA$500,000

As Grand Theft Auto VI drawing closer and the final chapter of GTA Online now underway, Rockstar Games has reportedly sending emails to its long-time players about a limited-time promotion. The company has quietly rolled out a this ‘freebee’ that allows GTA Online players to earn up to GTA$1,500,000 in free in-game cash — no grinding required, and no real money needed.According to a report by ScreenRant (via Rockstar Intel), GTA Online players received emails directly from Rockstar detailing the promotion. According to the email, players are being encouraged to complete Sell Missions during a specific window in exchange for special GTA$ bonuses, the report said.The Times of India Tech team could not confirm the veracity of the news. The promotion appears to be timed as a goodwill gesture following the recent A Safehouse in the Hills update, which saw players spend millions on new in-game properties, most notably a luxury mansion.By completing Sell Missions across three separate two-week periods, players can accumulate up to GTA$500,000 per period, totalling GTA$1,500,000 over the full run of the promotion.The report claims that the funds are deposited directly into a player's Maze Bank account within 72 hours of completing the relevant missions during each period.The promotion is said to be broken down into three distinct windows, each worth GTA$500,000:While the first window is closed, players still have a chance to earn GTA$1,000,000. The event kicked off alongside the Lunar New Year celebration on February 19 and runs through to March 11.There is one catch worth noting. The report notes that it is currently unclear whether the promotion applies to all GTA Online players or only those who received the email from Rockstar directly. Notably, the company has not made an official public announcement about the promotion.For those who are eligible, GTA$1,500,000 is a significant sum which can be used to buy a yacht, fully kit out a garage, invest in a business, or put toward that new mansion.","Rockstar games has quietly rolled out a this ‘freebee’ that allows gta online players to earn up to gta$1,500,000 in free in-game cash.

Gcc-Registered Cars Time Limit: Driving into Saudi Arabia? New 90-day rule for GCC vehicles explained,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/driving-into-saudi-arabia-new-90-day-rule-for-gcc-vehicles-explained/articleshow/128837229.cms,"Who the rule applies to



Extension requests allowed, but not guaranteed



Penalties for overstaying







Vehicles bearing Gulf plates will soon face a firm time limit inside Saudi Arabia. Under new rules approved by the Saudi government, cars registered in any Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) country can no longer remain in the Kingdom beyond 90 days within a 365-day period.The decision was issued by the Saudi Council of Ministers, which framed regulations to control how long GCC-registered vehicles may stay in the country. The 90-day cap applies whether the stay is consecutive or split across multiple visits. The countdown begins from the date the vehicle enters Saudi Arabia through any customs port.The regulations cover vehicles registered in GCC countries and owned by Saudi citizens, expatriates, or individuals authorized to drive them inside the Kingdom. However, cars rented from licensed rental establishments in GCC member states are excluded from the rule.Authorities say the move is intended to regulate vehicle usage and curb violations linked to cars remaining in Saudi Arabia for extended periods without local registration.Vehicle owners or authorized drivers may request an extension before the 90-day period expires. Applications must be submitted to the Ministry of Interior, which will review each request at its discretion and outline the required procedures and documentation.Implementation will involve coordination between government bodies. The Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority will supply the Ministry of Interior with necessary vehicle data. Owners or authorized drivers are required to register vehicle details at the customs port in line with the authority’s requirements upon entry.The regulations make clear that exceeding the permitted stay will trigger penalties under Article 68, Paragraph 5 of the Saudi Traffic Law, as overstaying constitutes a traffic violation.The governor of the Zakat, Tax and Customs Authority is expected to issue the executive decisions needed to activate the framework, in coordination with the Ministry of Interior.The new measures formalize what officials describe as a structured approach to monitoring foreign-registered vehicles and preventing prolonged stays without proper compliance.",Cars registered in any gulf cooperation council (gcc) country can no longer remain in the kingdom beyond 90 days within a 365-day period.

East India Company is wound up for a second time in London,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/east-india-company-is-wound-up-for-a-second-time-in-london/articleshow/128826852.cms,"TOI Correspondent from London:





The first time the East India Company (EIC) was formally dissolved was in 1874, as result of the 1857 First War of Independence when Indian soldiers from the company revolted. It was effectively abolished in 1858 when its control of India was transferred to the British Raj operating from a new India Office in Whitehall and its forces became the British Indian Army. For a second time, the EIC in London, surprisingly revived by a Mumbai businessman, is being wound up. It has gone into voluntary liquidation owing £1 million.Filings at Companies House show that it owes £611,279 (Rs 7.5 crore) to its parent company, the EIC Group, in the British Virgin Islands; £163,105 (Rs 2 crore) in wages to staff and £193,789 (Rs 2.4 crore) to the UK taxman. Its assets amount to just £60.39 (Rs 7,439.)CEO Sanjiv Mahendra Mehta bought the rights and assets, such as the coat of arms, of the original EIC from a group of shareholders in 2005. In 2010, after investing £10 million, he turned it into a luxury lifestyle brand selling fine Asian foods, tea, chocolates, jewellery, coins and homeware — with an Eastern theme.Born into a Gujarati Jain family in Mumbai, Mehta, now British, comes from a lineage of diamond traders.An alumnus of Sydenham College, Mumbai and IIM Ahmedabad, he moved to the UK in 1989. His vision was to once again turn the EIC into a global commercial venture trading from London. His company’s branding spoke of “retaining the pioneering spirit and merchant mindset that defined its formation”.In 2010 the company opened its flagship store in Mayfair; this later moved to Bond Street. At the time Mehta had said: “I am Indian, so there is a huge feeling of redemption for me. It is buying back a company that owned India.” The store now lies empty, and the website has disappeared.In 2023 Mehta launched an enormous collectible coin called “the Crown”, made of 3.6kg of gold and 6,426 diamonds, to mark the first anniversary of the Queen’s death.Whilst the original EIC plundered India, this company has sunk owing money to the British.","The first time the east india company (eic) was formally dissolved was in 1874.

The unconscious soundtrack of the doomscroll generation? It's phonk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/the-unconscious-soundtrack-of-the-doomscroll-generation-its-phonk/articleshow/128763387.cms,"



In the last month, the music artist with the largest audience across YouTube platforms wasn't Bad Bunny or Taylor Swift. It was Slxughter, a phonk producer. The term probably doesn't sound familiar, but anyone who's spent any time on social media has almost certainly listened to it.Maybe it's better to say ""heard it,"" since the overwhelming majority of people who consume phonk don't recognise it as a genre, let alone actively choose it. But it's constantly playing in the background during YouTube Shorts, TikTok or Instagram Reels. It can sound like electronic dance music, but also hip-hop, trap, funk or a mix of those. It can accompany dance clips, gaming montages, fan edits, workout content, sports highlights, motivational clips and anything aiming to convey high-energy vibes.Quietly making its way as the most popular music on vertical videos, phonk has become the unconscious soundtrack of a generation that spends hours doomscrolling online. And it has earned a fortune for its producers, often teenagers who can create a viral track from their bedrooms and become millionaires through royalties within a matter of months.""I've been waiting for this conversation for the past, like, five years,"" Kevin Meenan, 43, music trends manager at YouTube, said as an opening statement in a call.The reason someone like Slxughter has such a huge following on YouTube, Meenan explained, is that the monthly audience is calculated by combining ""classic"" YouTube views with the listenership on all YouTube platforms, including Shorts. This month, Slxughter's music reached 981 million unique users, more than twice Taylor Swift's (394 million) and more than six times Bad Bunny's (150 million).""Phonk is a sleeping giant,"" Josh Mateer, 34, head of A&R at SoundOn, TikTok's distribution platform for artists and labels, said in a phone interview. ""There is a huge juxtaposition between the volume of internet traffic around phonk and the sort of culture as an underground musical movement.""The roots of the genre date back to the Memphis, Tennessee, rap scene of the late '80s and '90s, when producers like Tommy Wright III and Three 6 Mafia began defining a raw, sinister sound marked by heavy bass, eerie lyrics, cowbells and hypnotic loops.By the end of the 2010s, Russian and Eastern European producers entered the scene. Tyler Blatchley, 41, co-founder of the phonk label Black 17 Media, was working at Sony at the time. In Dec2020, he heard an obscure track by Russian producer Kaito Shoma on TikTok and recognised some Three 6 Mafia lyrics. He contacted the group's DJ Paul and cleared the song for monetisation. It was the beginning of what is called drift phonk (from its use in clips of drifting cars) and the genre's explosion on social platforms.Today, Blatchley lives in a villa with a pool and basketball court one hour's drive from Miami. ""We don't even know how to pronounce half of them,"" he said. ""These kids are producers that work out of their bedroom from all over the world, and they're watching the algorithm to see what's popular on vertical video, and then they're adjusting the kind of music that they make accordingly.""The latest iteration of phonk is so-called Brazilian phonk. Initially dubbed Automotivo phonk, it got confused with Brazilian ""funk,"" an older genre with authentic Brazilian roots. It is this branch of phonk - more aggressive than drift, but in some cases more danceable - that pushed Slxughter to the top of the charts.","Phonk has become the soundtrack of a generation that spends hours doomscrolling online.

It was by one Peter Paul, who identifies himself as a proud Irishman.The man dug up YouTube videos made by Indians advising fellow Indians how to get free groceries in foreign countries and blamed it on Indian culture.""It's their culture.

Felix “PewDiePie” Kjellberg explains how Qwen 32B fine-tuning and benchmark tests led to his ChatGPT claim





On February 26, 2026, popular YouTuber Felix “PewDiePie” Kjellberg uploaded a video with a bold claim. In a video titled “I Trained My Own AI… It beat ChatGPT,” he said the artificial intelligence model he trained performed better than ChatGPT-4 and several other well-known AI systems. Right at the start, he told viewers, “The deed is done. I can finally return to this channel ’cause I have done what I said I was going to do. I trained my own AI model.”He then shared benchmark results that, according to him, backed up his statement. PewDiePie said, “I ran the benchmarks, official AI benchmark, and my model outperforms DeepSeek 2.5, way bigger model than mine. Facebook’s flagship model, LLaMA 4 Maverick, destroyed.Bang! Most importantly of all, my model outperforms ChatGPT’s 4 in like November or something.” The video quickly gained attention online, with fans debating how serious the comparison really was.As the video moved forward, Felix “PewDiePie” Kjellberg made one thing clear. He did not build a brand-new AI system from zero. He explained, “I have not created my own AI. I have merely taken an AI model and trained it. It’s like stealing a child on the street instead of birthing one myself.It’s way more effective that way. Plus, it would cost millions and millions of dollars in infrastructure, which I do not have yet.”He said his project was built on Qwen 32B, a model already strong at coding. However, he wanted it to perform better in a specific coding format.He explained, “The model that I used was Qwen 32B, which is already amazing at coding, but I needed it to be amazing at coding in this format.” While testing, he focused on a benchmark called Ader Polyglot, which checks coding ability in six languages.According to him, leading AI models did not perform as well as expected on that test. He said ChatGPT scored 18.2 percent, while Qwen 32B initially scored 8 percent.The turning point came when he switched from the DIFF format to the HOL format. He explained that this change pushed the score to 16 percent.To make it simple, he compared it to drawing a picture and adding a cloud without redrawing everything. His point was that format matters, and small technical adjustments can change results.PewDiePie’s experiment adds to his growing interest in open-source AI. Last year, he also shared that he had hosted large AI models, including OpenAI’s GPT-OSS 120B, on his personal computer.Whether his model truly “beat” ChatGPT in a broader sense is still open to debate. But his video clearly sparked fresh discussion about how AI tools are tested and compared.","Youtuber felix “pewdiepie” kjellberg uploaded a video with a bold claim.

‘Historic’: US Envoy Gor Hails Micron’s Chip Plant Launch In Guj, Cites Modi-Trump Friendship

India’s role in the global semiconductor supply chain is “essential” as other countries in the neighbourhood seek to dominate legacy chip production, US Ambassador to India Sergio Gor said on Saturday at the inauguration of Micron Technology’s semiconductor facility in Sanand, Gujarat.Speaking at the event where Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated the US-based company’s ATMP (Assembly, Testing, Marking and Packaging) plant, Gor said India offers a secure and reliable alternative in a strategically sensitive sector, PTI reported.“India's role in the global semiconductor supply chain is not just welcome, it is essential under the leadership of your great PM. As other nations in this neighbourhood aggressively expand production of legacy chips and seek to dominate the sector, India offers the secure and reliable alternative,” the US ambassador said.Describing semiconductors as the backbone of modern technology, Gor said they power everything from smartphones and defence systems to artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicles. Building “resilient supply chains” for such critical components requires semiconductor ecosystems at “multiple trusted locations”, he added.Gor termed Micron’s investment a strategic milestone. “This $2.75 billion investment represents far more than a new factory.It represents the future of American technology leadership, the strength of the US-India partnership, and our shared commitment to building a resilient supply chain that serves both our nations and the world,” he said.The ambassador noted that India currently has 10 semiconductor projects worth $19 billion under development, calling them a “direct testament” to Prime Minister Modi’s vision and ability to “secure the future of India and for global partners including the US.”Referring to growing bilateral cooperation, Gor said that when Modi and President Donald Trump met in Washington last February, they launched the U.S.-India COMPACT (Catalyzing Opportunities for Military Partnership, Accelerated Commerce & Technology). “At the heart of the framework is the TRUST initiative—transforming the relationship utilising strategic technology. Today's inauguration embodies that vision,” he said.He added that India’s focus on chip design and ATMP operations complements America’s push to manufacture the most advanced chips. The Gujarat government’s incentive policies for semiconductor projects set an example for other states, he said.Gor said the US was “beyond proud” of Micron’s Sanand facility and that other American companies are “watching closely” and exploring opportunities in Gujarat.Under Trump’s leadership, the US is strengthening its semiconductor capacity, he said, citing Micron’s $100 billion multi-fab facility in Clay, New York, the largest in US history. “We are investing in advanced chip manufacturing at home while building trusted partnership abroad. But American leadership isn't about doing it alone. Its about working with our partners who share common goals and our vision for secure, prosperous future,” Gor said.Earlier, Prime Minister Modi described the Micron plant as a testament to India–US collaboration. He also referred to the Pax Silica agreement between the two countries, saying “our collective efforts will also make the global supply chain of critical minerals more secure and reliable.”On February 20, India officially joined the Pax Silica initiative, a US-led international coalition aimed at securing global supply chains for artificial intelligence, semiconductors and critical minerals.",Sergio gor: india's role in global semiconductor supply chain is ‘essential’ he was speaking at the inauguration of micron technology’s semiconductor facility in sanand.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi inaugurated Micron Technology’s semiconductor facility at Sanand in Gujarat, asserting that India is now expanding its global identity beyond software into hardware manufacturing as it seeks a larger role in the global semiconductor value chain.The US-based company’s ATMP (Assembly, Testing, Marking and Packaging) plant, the first such facility of its kind in the country, reflects deepening India–US technology cooperation, the Prime Minister said while addressing the gathering.“The message has reached the world loud and clear: India is capable, India is competitive and India is committed,” Modi said, adding that the country is positioning itself as a reliable destination for global investors, PTI reported.“India, long known for its software strength, is now firmly establishing its identity in the hardware sector as well,” he said.The Prime Minister described semiconductors as central to the emerging technological era, linking industrial transformation with artificial intelligence-led growth. “If oil was the regulator of the last century, the microchip will be the regulator of this century,” he said, stressing that India had moved decisively into the semiconductor sector even during the COVID pandemic.He said India’s Semiconductor Mission was launched at a time of global uncertainty but the early investments are now beginning to deliver results. “During the pandemic, everything felt like it was falling apart, but the seeds we planted with conviction are now growing and bearing fruits,” Modi said.Highlighting strategic cooperation with the United States, the Prime Minister said both democracies are working closely in AI and chip technologies to build resilient and secure supply chains. He added that global demand for secure semiconductor and critical mineral supply chains is creating new opportunities for India.Modi noted that 10 projects have so far been approved under the Semicon India programme, with three additional facilities expected to begin production soon.
