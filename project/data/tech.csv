If your pre-flight checklist includes snacks, headphones, and a boarding pass—but not a Real ID—you might be in for an expensive surprise at the airport.Starting next month, you need to have a Read ID if you want to go for Domestic flights. The TSA said, ""Starting February 1, if you don’t have a REAL ID or acceptable form of ID (like a passport!) for domestic flights, you may pay a $45 fee to verify your identity through @TSA ConfirmID.""""A passport card ($30) or passport book are both accepted REAL ID alternatives for domestic air travel and can help you avoid this fee, but just remember that a passport card cannot be used for international air travel (you'll need a passport book for that),"" it added.For a trip lasting more than 10 days, the Illinois Secretary of State said the fee would be $90.According to TSA, the identification process took an average of 10-15 minutes, but it could take 30 minutes or more. Officials advised travellers to complete the process before arriving at the airport ""to avoid delays or missing your flight.""""You can pay the fee through your computer or mobile device at the airport, but TSA recommends paying ahead of time,"" the agency said. Cash would not be accepted.If travellers completed the process at the airport, they needed to get out of the security line to pay. In addition to the $45 fee, travellers should be prepared to give officials their legal name, address and date of birth for ConfirmID, TSA said.""After you finish the process, you must go to the end of the line for security screening and be prepared to present your receipt.""The identity verification would be valid for 10 days once approved. After that period, travellers without a REAL ID or passport would need to pay the fee again if they travelled.The fee applied to anyone trying to board a domestic flight who did not have any of TSA's acceptable forms of ID.Children under 18 did not need ID for domestic flights, TSA said, as long as they were accompanied by someone 18 or older.As of May 7, 2025, a regular, hard-copy driver's licence or state ID was no longer an acceptable form of ID to board a plane.The following IDs were acceptable at TSA checkpoints for domestic flights:Real IDState-issued Enhanced Driver's Licence (EDL) or Enhanced Identification Card (EID)Apple Digital ID from the state of IllinoisUS passportUS passport cardDHS trusted traveller cards (Global Entry, NEXUS, SENTRI, FAST)US Department of Defense ID, including IDs issued to dependentsPermanent resident cardBorder crossing cardAn acceptable photo ID issued by a federally recognised Tribal Nation/Indian Tribe, including Enhanced Tribal Cards (ETCs)HSPD-12 PIV cardForeign govt-issued passportCanadian provincial driver's licence or Indian and Northern Affairs Canada cardTransportation Worker Identification Credential (TWIC)US Citizenship and Immigration Services Employment Authorisation Card (I-766)US Merchant Mariner CredentialVeteran Health Identification Card (VHIC)Clear ID","Starting next month, you need to have a read id if you want to go for domestic flights.

UAE unveils region’s first biometric payment system using face and palm scans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-unveils-regions-first-biometric-payment-system-using-face-and-palm-scans/articleshow/127697761.cms,"UAE Central Bank pilots world-leading biometric payment system, letting users pay with face or palm / AI Image

UAE's new biometric payments

How does the biometric system work?

UAE’s fintech push

What comes next?





In a move that could redefine how people pay for everyday transactions, the UAE has begun piloting the Middle East’s first biometric payment system, allowing users to make payments using facial recognition or palm scans instead of cards, cash or mobile phones. The initiative, unveiled by the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE), places the country among a small group of global pioneers experimenting with card-free, password-free payments.Network International’s CEO, Murat Cagri Suzer stated “Biometric payments represent the next frontier in digital commerce, combining convenience, security and efficiency … as we advance the UAE’s position as a global hub for financial innovation and a digital-first economy.”The United Arab Emirates has launched what is being described as the Middle East’s first biometric payment solution, a move that could transform how people pay for goods and services in the region. The Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE) unveiled the initiative, currently in its proof-of-concept phase, which allows users to conduct secure transactions using facial recognition or palm scans instead of traditional payment instruments like cards, cash or phones.Demonstrated at the Dubai Land Department, this biometric payments project is part of the regulator’s Sandbox Programme and developed in partnership with Network International and US biometrics firm PopID. The aim is not only to make payments more convenient but also to raise the bar for security in everyday financial transactions.By removing the need for physical payment tools, the UAE hopes to advance its broader ambitions to become a global hub for financial innovation and a leading digital economy. Officials say the biometric payments project supports financial inclusion and technological leadership, offering a glimpse into the future of cashless commerce.Biometric payments rely on unique physical characteristics, in this case, a person’s face or palm pattern, to verify identity and authorize payments. This removes dependence on cards or mobile devices and can significantly reduce the risk of fraud tied to stolen cards, lost devices, or intercepted authentication codes.The technology works by capturing a biometric image (face or palm) at the point of sale and matching it against a securely stored template. Once verified, the payment is authorized instantly. This method is designed to be fast, secure and seamless, with businesses able to accept payments without requiring customers to reach for wallets or phones.The UAE’s biometric payments rollout is just one part of a larger push to modernize financial services and strengthen cybersecurity across its digital ecosystem. Earlier in 2026, the Central Bank mandated the phase-out of SMS one-time passwords (OTPs) for online transactions, requiring banks to adopt biometric or secure in-app authentication instead, a dramatic shift in how transactions are protected.Under this new framework, major UAE banks like Emirates NBD, ADIB and FAB have moved away from SMS OTPs toward biometric login and app-based authorization using face or fingerprint recognition. Industry sources say this change is aimed at reducing fraud risks linked to SIM-swapping, phishing and other vulnerabilities that SMS codes cannot address effectively.The biometric payments system expands this philosophy, using even more robust personal identifiers to protect financial interactions throughout the economy.The biometric approach aligns with global trends. For example, Mastercard and Visa have introduced biometric authentication features in digital payments across the Middle East, such as payment passkeys and FIDO-based solutions that replace passwords with device biometrics for secure online checkout.While the biometric payment solution is currently in the pilot stage, its successful demonstration suggests a broader rollout in the future. If fully adopted, this system could reshape everything from retail checkouts to government services, moving the UAE closer to a truly cardless and device-free financial environment.The Central Bank’s efforts, backed by recent legislative changes to strengthen its mandate and financial stability, demonstrate a commitment to innovation while protecting consumers and businesses.As the technology evolves and adoption grows, experts expect other countries in the region, and beyond, to watch closely, potentially accelerating the global trend toward biometric authentication in finance.","Uae central bank pilots world-leading biometric payment system, letting users pay with face or palm.

Samuel was sent this picture as claimed proof of delivery, though he pointed out the phone should have been signed for (Kennedy News and Media)





A delivery driver has been removed after home security footage appeared to show him faking the delivery of a £1,200 iPhone and driving away with the parcel instead.Samuel Taylor, 20, from Rochdale, ordered a £1,264 iPhone 17 Pro Max through Giffgaff, with delivery handled by DPD. On 19 January, Taylor received a photo notification claiming the parcel had been posted through his letterbox. When he returned home from work, the phone was nowhere to be found. His father confirmed no delivery had taken place.Footage from the family’s security camera showed a courier pulling up outside the house, selecting a parcel from his van and approaching the front door. Moments later, the driver appeared to walk back to the vehicle still holding the same package before driving off.“I was shocked,” Taylor said. “When I got home my dad said it wasn’t actually there. We checked the cameras and saw what happened. I was just really annoyed and I feel robbed.”Taylor contacted DPD to complain but said he was initially told the phone had been delivered and advised to raise the issue with Giffgaff. Instead, he reported the incident to Greater Manchester Police and posted the footage on social media in an effort to force the company to respond.“Since DPD are not interested in their driver not delivering my £1,200 iPhone I thought I’d shame them on here,” he wrote.Reviewing the footage later, Taylor said it became clear the driver appeared unaware he was being recorded, ruling out the possibility of an administrative mix-up or a delayed return to the depot.“I don’t think he noticed the cameras,” Taylor said. “I thought it might’ve gone back to the warehouse, but we got in touch with DPD and they said it hadn’t been signed back in.DPD later confirmed that the driver had been “removed from the business” following an internal investigation. A spokesperson said: “We have carried out a thorough investigation and can confirm that the driver has been removed from the business. We have a zero-tolerance approach to incidents such as this and will always take firm action. We apologise whole-heartedly to Mr Taylor and have informed Giffgaff.”Giffgaff said the proof of delivery did not meet its standards and confirmed Taylor’s deposit had been refunded while the case is reviewed. “We’re sorry to hear that Samuel did not receive his new iPhone as intended,” a spokesperson said.Taylor said he still has not received the phone and no longer trusts the courier. “With something that expensive it has to be signed for anyway,” he said. “I just want the phone I paid for.”","Samuel taylor, 20, from rochdale, ordered a £1,264 iphone 17 pro max through giffgaff, with delivery handled by dpd.

Nokia taught a generation how to connect, Angry Birds became a national timepass, and KONE quietly lifts millions of Indians every day in offices and apartment towers. Now, the same country that once drove our everyday tech habits is pitching something bigger - a place to study, build and work in fields such as AI and deep tech. According to industry voices, Finland's need for skilled professionals - supported by govt policies seen as favourable for work mobility and startups - has opened up roles for the Indian youth in various fields, be it data science, machine learning, computer vision or generative AI.Laura Lindeman, senior director of 'Work in Finland' at Business Finland, says the country is not just hiring youths with experience in AI, but also investing to scale up its R&D. ""Finland is in the process of attracting top deep tech researchers and specialists in areas such as artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, microelectronics, photonics, imaging and health tech. In addition to excellent opportunities for professional and personal development, experts working in Finland benefit from a strong national commitment to R&D. The country already invests 3.2% of its GDP in research and development, and govt aims to increase this share to 4% by 2030.For Indian candidates from these fields, this means more opportunities to access world-class research infrastructure and build careers in companies and universities that play a key role in driving global innovation,"" she adds.The message also came through at a recent AI summit in Turku, where the Finnish govt underlined its ambition to be a serious player in the global AI race, keeping international collaboration at the centre. PM Petteri Orpo described it as a strategic imperative. ""Europe must lead, not follow, in the AI revolution,"" he said.At the summit, discussions were also undertaken on how the Finnish market requires diverse skillsets, from technical to creative problem-solving expertise. For Indian students and professionals, the subtext was clear - Finland wants talent, and it wants it now.But the opportunities are not limited to those looking for jobs alone. For those interested in startups, Finland's ecosystem provides a fertile ground, characterised by a dynamic startup culture and high levels of innovation in AI research, doctoral roles, and advanced computing facilities like LUMI supercomputer, one of the world's most powerful supercomputers located in Kajaani.For students too, Finland's latest push in R&D means availability of globally recognised AI courses that are closely linked with industry projects. The inauguration of the ELLIS Institute this Nov was a crucial step in this regard, fostering an environment conducive to cutting-edge research.","Finland is pitching itself as a place to study, build and work in fields such as ai and deep tech.

Bitcoin for car insurance? Dubai becomes first to accept crypto for insurance premium,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/bitcoin-for-car-insurance-dubai-becomes-first-to-accept-crypto-for-insurance-premium/articleshow/127694231.cms,"Cryptocurrency Payments Approved for Insurance in the UAE / Image: File

How will crypto payments work?

Regulatory support

Why choose crypto for payment?

Bypassing the Middleman: Traditional bank transfers, especially for large premiums, can be hit with unexpected fees and ""pending"" statuses. Crypto moves directly from your wallet to the insurer, often at a fraction of the cost.

24/7 Mobility: Unlike banks that close for weekends or public holidays, the blockchain never sleeps. You can renew your policy at 2:00 AM on a Friday and have your digital certificate issued instantly.

Inflation Protection: By keeping your wealth in digital assets and paying directly, you avoid the multiple conversion fees (Crypto to Fiat, then Fiat to Insurance) that eat away at your purchasing power.

Automated Trust: With smart contracts, your claim payouts could eventually be automated. Imagine a travel delay being detected by the blockchain and your compensation being sent to your wallet before you even leave the airport.





Forget writing checks or waiting for bank transfers. In a move that has sent shockwaves through the regional financial sector, Dubai Insurance has officially opened the doors for UAE residents to pay their insurance premiums using Bitcoin (BTC) and other major cryptocurrencies.As of January 2026, following a landmark regulatory shift in the DIFC, the company has launched a specialized digital wallet that integrates directly with your crypto portfolio. This means the same Bitcoin you use for trading can now be used to insure your SUV, your apartment, or your health, marking the first time a regulated UAE insurer has allowed digital assets to flow so freely within its ecosystem.Insurance companies offering these services are enabling customers to use approved cryptocurrencies to pay for their policies and, in some cases, submit claims. While this isn’t yet universal across all insurers, early adopters are paving the way by integrating digital wallets and payment gateways that accept digital currencies securely.This development aligns with how cryptocurrencies are being used more broadly in the UAE’s digital economy. For example, the country has seen banks and fintech players embrace digital assets: Emirates NBD launched crypto trading through its Liv unit, allowing customers to buy, sell and trade digital currencies via its mobile app.The UAE has been proactive in crafting regulations that support digital asset adoption while protecting consumers. Frameworks such as the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA) and the Abu Dhabi Global Market’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority (ADGM FSRA) provide clear guidelines for licensing, compliance and risk controls for crypto platforms and virtual asset service providers (VASPs).Additionally, recent regulatory changes are designed to attract institutional participation in digital assets by streamlining approvals and expanding the scope of regulated services. These changes help ensure that emerging financial products, including crypto‑linked insurance payments, are backed by clarity and oversight.In the fast-paced economy of 2026, many residents are asking: Why should I use my Bitcoin instead of a credit card or cash? The answer lies in efficiency and the unique ""programmable"" nature of digital assets.The major perks of going digital:For years, crypto in the UAE was mostly viewed as a ""speculative"" investment, something you buy and hold. This announcement changes everything. It turns your digital assets into a functional currency.For the thousands of residents who earn in crypto or hold significant digital wealth, this removes the friction of having to ""cash out"" to AED just to pay an annual insurance bill. It’s a direct response to the UAE’s ""Next Gen Finance"" goals, proving that the country is ready to treat Bitcoin with the same seriousness as the Dirham.","Dubai insurance has officially opened the doors for uae residents to pay their insurance premiums using bitcoin (btc) and other major cryptocurrencies.

What do these giant dinosaur footprints reveal about prehistoric life

Why this dinosaur footprint discovery is so important





Researchers have found some of the biggest dinosaur footprints ever. They are so huge that an adult could curl up inside one without a problem. It’s wild to imagine, honestly. This kind of find really turns our old ideas about prehistoric life on its head.This ancient print was uncovered along the Dampier Peninsula in Western Australia and is given the title of “ Largest dinosaur footprint ” by Guinness World Records. They are embedded in fossil-rich sandstone that dates to the Early Cretaceous, which was roughly 130 million years ago.The site stands out because the prints aren’t just massive; they’re deep and come in all kinds of shapes, showing off the variety of dinosaurs that wandered through this part of northwest Australia. It’s more than just proof of some truly gigantic creatures. These tracks give us a real peek into the world of Gondwana, the ancient southern supercontinent that once included Australia.A sauropod footprint that’s about 1.7 meters long, so just over 5 and a half feet, was found in this site. That’s the largest dinosaur footprint anyone’s ever found. Researchers from the University of Queensland and James Cook University matched these giant tracks to sauropods, those long-necked, plant-munching giants that once roamed the Earth.A vertebrate palaeontologist at the University of Queensland put it simply: some tracks here are so huge, most people could actually fit inside one. The dinosaurs that left them probably stood about 5.3 to 5.5 meters tall at the hip. Even for dinosaurs, that’s seriously massive.These footprints sit in what people now like to call Australia’s own Jurassic Park. Along the coast where the Broome Sandstone stretches out, scientists have found over 150 tracks from at least 21 different kinds of dinosaurs. We’re talking big meat-eaters like theropods, two-legged plant-eaters called ornithopods, armoured dinosaurs known as thyreophorans, and quite a few sauropods too.This makes the site one of the most varied dinosaur tracksites you’ll find anywhere, and it gives Australia some of its best proof of dinosaur life from the Early Cretaceous.The Broome Sandstone itself is seriously ancient. It started as river delta mud and sand, then, ages later, it showed up along today’s shoreline. What’s really cool is that a lot of these tracks sit out in the intertidal zone. They only appear when the tide’s out, so the timing has to be just right. It’s this odd bit of geology that’s turned the place into a goldmine for palaeontologists.For the first time in Australia, researchers have found confirmed stegosaur footprints. Evidence that these dinosaurs once roamed here, even though nobody had spotted them in the fossil record before.These tracks back up earlier discoveries highlighted by National Geographic , which pointed out how massive the Kimberley prints are and how much they reveal about dinosaur life in ancient times. And it’s not just about size. These trackways tell us how these giants moved, how they lived, and how they fit into their world. Footprints like these freeze a brief moment from the distant past, letting scientists study actual dinosaur behaviour, not just their bones.It’s wild to think about, but it really drives home just how huge and lively the ancient world was. These fossil tracks aren’t just old marks in the ground; they’re snapshots of colossal sauropods, bustling herds, and prehistoric landscapes frozen in stone. If you find yourself on the coast of Western Australia when the tide goes out, you’re literally walking over one of the greatest dinosaur stories we’ve ever uncovered.","Researchers have found some of the biggest dinosaur footprints ever.

H-1B Visa Shake-Up Fuels Anti-Indian Campaigns as Donald Trump's Policy Reshapes US Hiring

Drop them, find new employees

US-India income tax treaty





As Amazon has come forward and announced that it would allow its H-1B employees stuck in India to work remotely, experts warned that US businesses risk hefty tax bills if they allow workers this option, as no one knows how long the delay may take. Thousands of H-1B workers are stuck in India since November as they went to India to get stamped for their H-1B visa, but after reaching India, they got to know that their interview schedules have been deferred to 2026.The delay started as the State Department mandated a new social media vetting for every H-1B and H-4 application across the world. Indian H-1B holders were hit the hardest as Indian consular offices drastically reduced the number of per-day appointments after the social media vetting process began on December 15, 2025. Interview dates were randomly deferred and now applicants who had their dates in 2026 January and February received emails that their dates have been pushed to 2027 -- as a result of the cumulative postponement of dates since December.Those who are stuck in India and cannot enter the US with a new visa stamping are at risk of losing their jobs. Allowing them to work remotely for an extended period could result in a so-called “permanent taxable entity,” Parizad Sirwalla, partner and national head of tax at Global Mobility Services at KPMG India, told Bloomberg.If stranded workers trigger the creation of a permanent establishment in India, that new entity would have to pay taxes in India and comply with a myriad of reporting requirements, Sirwalla said. The tax and reporting obligations that would entail mean employers need to carefully analyze activities that workers can perform while present in the country, she explained.If the companies fire these H-1B employees and decide to find new employees, they would have to pay a $100,000 fee for new H-1B visa holders if they are not in the US.The US and India have a tax treaty since 1989 to avoid double taxation. Under this, a US company is taxed in India only if it has a permanent establishment (PE) in India. But it is not well defined when an entity becomes a PE and experts warn that any time a US company has employees working for it in India, the PE risk remains.","Thousands of h-1b workers are stuck in india since november as they went to india to get stamped for their visa.

Pokimane denies billionaire label as chat moderation sparks debate

“I’m not a billionaire,”

“billionaire”





Twitch streamer Pokimane recently addressed a chat message during a livestream that labeled her aquickly rejecting the claim and taking moderation action against the viewer. The moment, which was clipped and shared widely online, sparked fresh discussion about creator wealth, online criticism, and how streamers manage their communities during live broadcasts.Pokimane, whose real name is Imane Anys, made it clear that the description was inaccurate. She firmly stated that she is not a billionaire and expressed frustration at the label, which she said did not reflect reality. Shortly after responding, the viewer who posted the message was removed from the chat, drawing further attention to the exchange.During the stream, Pokimane directly addressed the comment and laughed it off before correcting it.she said, pushing back against the claim. She then added a hypothetical statement, explaining that even if she ever reached that level of wealth, she would not keep it. According to Pokimane, she would give away most of the money, saying she believes many people would do the same if they had extreme wealth.The viewer who posted the comment was kicked out of the chat, sparking rumors among fans as to whether this was a permanent ban or a temporary timeout.Several sources later confirmed that this was indeed a timeout and not a ban, although the temporary removal was sufficient to cause a stir among fans. While some fans were in support of Pokimane's moderation of her chat, others felt that the punishment was too severe for the offense.This incident has come at a time when internet discussions about the earnings of creators are becoming more frequent. Popular Twitch streamers such as Pokimane earn money from subscriptions, donations, sponsorships, and brand partnerships, which can lead to substantial earnings. Nevertheless, the use of the termwas generally recognized as being untrue, even among the critics.The video also made headlines because of the discussions that have been going on regarding Pokimane’s cookie business. Recently, she was under fire for her reaction to viewers who were complaining about the price of her products, and as a result, wealth has become a touchy subject for her fans.Ultimately, this video is important because it shows the struggle that popular content creators have when they are live streaming. With thousands of people watching in real-time, even the smallest statements can become a viral sensation.","Pokimane, whose real name is imane anys, made it clear that the description was inaccurate.

Nicholas Lee, a military veteran who is running for Congress from Texas’s 2nd Congressional District, said he lost his Amazon job in its latest tranche of layoff announced Wednesday. Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti, confirmed the layoff in a blog post. ""As I shared in October, we've been working to strengthen our organization by reducing layers, increasing ownership, and removing bureaucracy,"" Galetti said. ""While many teams finalized their organizational changes in October, other teams did not complete that work until now.""The announcement included assurance that US-based employees would get 90 days to look for a new role internally.This layoff announcement comes as the company recently allowed H-1B workers who got stuck in India because of the visa stamping delay to work remotely.Amid this situation, Nicholas Plumb said this does not happen in isolation and AI or performance are not the reasons.

And if you’re expensive because you’re good at what you do, the system eventually “optimizes” you out.""""This doesn’t happen in isolation. It’s enabled by a global labor market with almost no guardrails. Companies aren’t just competing on products anymore, they’re arbitraging labor across borders, wages, benefits and worker protections. When replacement is cheaper than retention, the decision gets framed as strategy instead of consequence.""Though he did not cite H-1B workers, the Republican candidate said experience labor gets swapped out through global labor substitution.""I saw this coming and that’s why I’m running for Congress.

Hollywood’s connection to the NFL

In 2016, Taylor Swift was 27, Gigi Hadid was 21, and Olivia Culpo was 24. The twenties are when people can be whoever they want to be. In 2016, the ‘pouting’ or ‘duck face’ was a major selfie trend. Put these together, and you get Christian McCaffrey’s wife, Olivia Culpo, sharing a throwback moment with all those elements on her Instagram.Culpo captions it: “2016: the year of the bob, the selfie stick, airport photos, chokers, and not a single outfit going undocumented … I’m a little late with this!

Funny enough, I miss these times but at the bottom of my heart I always knew I wanted to be right where I am now in 2026 as a mom [three red heart emojis].”The 2012 Miss Universe recently shared 18 snapshots on her Instagram. The ninth featured Travis Kelce’s fiancée, Taylor Swift, and Gigi Hadid, who is Bradley Cooper’s girlfriend. It looked like a photo booth shot, with pictures taken in quick succession and little time to change poses. Culpo shared two monochrome pictures, one above the other.At the top right corner of the picture, ‘[GIGI’S] TWENTY-FIRST’ was written. It was likely Hadid’s 21st birthday party, since she was 21 in 2016. Culpo is in the left-most corner, wearing a halter neck net top or dress.Hadid is wearing a sleeveless, satin black top with a white scarf around her neck.Swift’s outfit is not visible in the picture because she is hiding behind her brother, Austin Swift. However, she was wearing a black one-shouldered, form-fitting mini dress with multi-colored specks. She had short blond hair and wore dark burgundy lipstick.Who would have thought their [Culpo, Swift, and Hadid] worlds would collide in the decade to come? From photo booth monochrome shots in 2016 to the NFL world in 2026! Swift is engaged to Kansas City Chiefs star tight end Travis Kelce.

The Milwaukee Bucks and Giannis Antetokounmpo carefully move toward an inevitable split

Contract timing and trade logistics make the Giannis Antetokounmpo deal difficult to finalize

The rumors surrounding the NBA trade deadline have officially begun. On Wednesday, January 28, there was significant news regarding Giannis Antetokounmpo's future with the Milwaukee Bucks. Before the trade deadline on February 5, the two-time MVP is reportedly prepared for a new home.According to league sources who spoke to ESPN on Wednesday, the Bucks are beginning to listen to multiple teams' strong proposals. The market has reportedly lagged because a number of teams with the assets required to make a bid for Antetokounmpo have been waiting for him to become formally available via a trade.Antetokounmpo has previously stated that he's prepared to leave the Bucks, according to an ESPN article that was released on Wednesday morning. Allegedly, neither Antetokounmpo nor the Bucks have wanted to take responsibility for what is turning out to be inevitable, so they have been cautious about the optics.The Bucks are now facing serious concerns about their future course, which has prompted candid discussions between the two parties. Although Milwaukee is not required to trade the two-time MVP, the Bucks are reportedly more willing than ever to consider offers for Antetokounmpo before the trading deadline, according to ESPN.Additionally, as per the league insiders, several teams have heard that the Bucks are now accepting Antetokounmpo proposals between now and the deadline. However, Milwaukee has reportedly made it clear that the team is not in a rush to finalize a move.The sources have said that the organization is also prepared to negotiate Antetokounmpo's future in the offseason if it doesn't meet its perceived price point for a young, elite player or an excess of draft picks.The Bucks may also be able to determine which teams can make more impressive draft selections in June if they wait until the summer. According to sources, Antetokounmpo has been telling the Bucks for months that he feels it's time to part ways after more than 12 years together.The mechanics of getting all the moving pieces together by next Thursday would be challenging because a deal like this might also need a third or fourth team. According to ESPN, prospective suitors believe Milwaukee is open to receiving proposals.The team now has a lottery pick in the draft, with both the New Orleans Pelicans' and its own selection being less advantageous. On October 1, Antetokounmpo will be able to sign a $275 million, four-year supermax deal. If he declines a $62.8 million player option that summer, he could become an unrestricted free agent in the 2027 offseason.Meanwhile, when asked on January 19 if he was certain he would remain with the Bucks for the rest of the season, Antetokounmpo said:""I don't know. I don't know. I take it day by day.""Although there is no assurance that he will go before the trade deadline on February 5, several NBA teams will want to do so. However, the giant himself hasn’t said anything about it as of yet.","The milwaukee bucks and giannis antetokounmpo carefully move toward an inevitable split.

WhatsApp launches Strict Account Settings: What is feature all about and how it works,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/whatsapp-launches-strict-account-settings-what-is-feature-all-about-and-how-it-works/articleshow/127639534.cms,"How WhatsApp Strict Account Settings feature works



WhatsApp sued, Meta alleged to have access to all user chats







Hours after Whatsapp chief Will Cathcart called out Elon Musk for posting ‘totally false’ information that “WhatsApp is not secure,” the Meta-owned instant messaging app has launched Strict Account Settings – a lockdown-style feature, aimed at protecting users protect “from the most sophisticated of cyber threats. ”“At WhatsApp, we think you should be able to have a private conversation online, just like you would in-person. We will always defend that right to privacy for everyone, starting with default end-to-end encryption. But we also know that a few of our users – like journalists or public-facing figures – may need extreme safeguards against rare and highly-sophisticated cyber attacks,” the company said in a post.As per WhatsApp, if users turn this feature on, certain account settings will lock to the most restrictive settings, limiting how WhatsApp works in some ways. For example, it will block all attachments and media from people not in your contacts.“Strict Account Settings is one of many ways we’re working to protect you from the most sophisticated of cyber threats. We’ve also rolled out a programming language called Rust behind the scenes to help keep your photos, videos, and messages safe from things like spyware, so you can share and chat with confidence,” WhatsApp added.WhatsApp says that Strict Account Settings feature is being rolled out gradually over the coming weeks. Once updated, users can enable the feature by going to Settings > Privacy > Advanced.The feature comes a day after an international group of plaintiffs filed a class-action lawsuit against Meta-owned instant messaging platform WhatsApp, accusing the company of defrauding billions of users by allegedly maintaining 'backdoor access to private communications that the company claims are ""end-to-end encryption"" (E2EE). The lawsuit claims that WhatsApp can “store, analyze, and can access virtually all of WhatsApp users' purportedly 'private' communications”.Meta called the lawsuit 'frivolous' and 'absurd', and company spokesperson Andy Stone said that Meta will seek legal sanctions against the plaintiffs' counsel for bringing the case forward.“Any claim that people's WhatsApp messages are not encrypted is categorically false. WhatsApp has been end-to-end encrypted using the Signal protocol for a decade. This lawsuit is a frivolous work of fiction,” Stone told Bloomberg.Cathcart also lashed out at Musk by saying that the lawsuit was filed by lawyers who previously defended spyware company NSO Group.“WhatsApp can't read messages because the encryption keys are stored on your phone and we don't have access to them. This is a no-merit, headline-seeking lawsuit brought by the very same firm defending NSO after their spyware attacked journalists and government officials,"" Cathcart wrote on X.","Strict account settings feature is being rolled out gradually over the coming weeks.

This partnership, confirmed this month, signifies a major shift for Apple, which previously favored in-house development. The revamped Siri, powered by Gemini, is expected with iOS 26.4, aiming for a March/April rollout.

Apple weighed options from OpenAI and Anthropic before settling on Google

Hassabis sees room for the partnership to grow





Google DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis isn't hiding his satisfaction over the Apple deal. In an interview with Alex Heath, Hassabis said he's proud that Gemini came out on top after Apple put multiple AI providers through a thorough evaluation. He added that Google has ideas for efficient AI models that could work well on edge devices like phones and even in robotics.The multi-year partnership, confirmed earlier this month, means Apple's foundation models will now be built on Gemini and Google's cloud technology. A joint statement from both companies said Apple found Google's AI to be the most capable option available. The models will still run on Apple devices and its Private Cloud Compute infrastructure, keeping the company's privacy commitments intact.According to Bloomberg, Apple is shelling out roughly $1 billion a year for a custom 1.2 trillion parameter Gemini model. The company evaluated offerings from Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic. Bloomberg's Mark Gurman reported that OpenAI was never really in the running, while Anthropic led early discussions before pricing talks broke down.The Financial Times pegged the deal's total value at around $5 billion for Google, structured as cloud services rather than a straight licensing arrangement. The revamped Siri powered by Gemini is expected to arrive with iOS 26.4, which should hit beta in February before a wider rollout in March or April.Asked about where Google wants to place Gemini versus keeping it exclusive to its own products, Hassabis said it depends on the situation. He noted that Google still has an edge with first-party devices because it can tightly integrate models with product surfaces. But he made clear the company is keen on enterprise business and deeper collaborations with partners that bring strong ecosystems to the table.For Apple, the deal represents a notable departure from its usual playbook of building everything in-house. The company pushed back its major Siri overhaul from spring 2025 to 2026 and moved AI chief John Giannandrea away from product development. The partnership also builds on a long history between the two tech giants—Google already pays Apple billions annually to remain the default search engine on iPhones.","Apple has chosen google's gemini ai for its foundation models, a multi-year deal reportedly worth around $1 billion annually.
