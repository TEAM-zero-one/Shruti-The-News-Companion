Tyra Banks pitches a bold new take on the iconic film and reveals she’s already talking with Idris Elba

Tyra Banks says flipping the original casting could make the story even hotter

Tyra Banks reveals she's already in contact with Idris Elba about the idea

Supermodel and entrepreneur Tyra Banks has her sights set on shaking up Hollywood with a modern remake of the classic 1992 romantic thriller The Bodyguard — and she wants none other than Taylor Swift and Idris Elba to lead the cast.In an interview on the Today with Jenna & Friends podcast, Tyra Banks revealed her dream casting idea, pairing global pop sensation Taylor Swift with British actor Idris Elba in a gender-flipped reimagining of the Whitney Houston and Kevin Costner hit. “I think Taylor Swift, 'cause business and commerce, art — she would freakin' sell like crazy,” Banks said, praising Swift’s influence and marketability.The original Bodyguard followed a famous singer (played by Whitney Houston) who is protected by a former Secret Service agent (Kevin Costner) as she faces a stalker threat. Their professional relationship evolves into a powerful romance, cementing the film as a box office success with over $400 million in global earnings.But Banks isn’t just talking nostalgia — she’s envisioning a contemporary twist with a fresh dynamic. “What if we flipped it and it was Taylor Swift and Idris Elba? Hot!” Banks added, pointing out the potential appeal of reversing the racial and gender roles of the iconic duo.This isn’t just fan-fiction — Banks says she’s already connected with Elba about working together. “We’re like WhatsApp friends right now,” she revealed. “I’m like, ‘Are you down?’ He’s like, ‘Yeah, Banks.’ I’m like, ‘Okay, I’m gonna make this happen.’ I feel like we should do, like, the romance thing.”Though Swift has yet to show clear interest in acting full-time, she’s no stranger to the screen, having appeared in Cats, Amsterdam, and her own Eras Tour concert film. With the tour's director reportedly linked to the remake, the stars may be aligning for Swift to make her big acting breakthrough in a legacy role.Also Read: “Taylor has no bones”: Joe Alwyn praised for staying classy post Taylor Swift breakup as his Hollywood stock rises Whether this dream casting takes off or not, the buzz is already heating up — and fans are eager to see if Tyra Banks can turn her bold vision into reality.",Tyra banks wants taylor swift and idris elba to star in a gender-flipped remake of the bodyguard.

These are the 3 shows Kylie and Jason Kelce can't stop watching together during quiet nights



Kylie reveals the TV shows she and Jason HAVE to watch together | More Sh*t Monday

Life has taken a heartwarming turn in the Kelce household. Kylie and Jason Kelce have recently welcomed their fourth daughter, expanding their family of five into a joyful clan of six. With the newest addition settling in, the couple is savoring quieter, slower-paced moments at home—something that aligns perfectly with Jason’s post-NFL chapter and Kylie’s need for recovery and rest.Following childbirth, Kylie has been prioritizing self-care, leaning into the healing process while tending to their newborn. Amidst the demands of early motherhood, she and Jason are finding small windows of peace—moments where they can unwind and simply enjoy being together. And like many parents trying to balance life with a newborn, they’ve turned to TV as a way to decompress and reconnect.Jason, having stepped away from his NFL career just last year, is now enjoying the offseason of his media endeavors. With more flexibility in his schedule, he’s able to be present at home, making this transitional time even more special for the family.During a recent episode of her Not Gonna Lie podcast, Kylie opened up about the shows they’ve been watching. Fans were curious, and Kylie didn’t hesitate to share their current watchlist. “We are all caught up on The Great British Bakeoff . I did inform Jason just the other day that we do need to catch up on Taskmaster. It is hilarious and outstanding,” she revealed. Their latest shared favorite, Taskmaster, a British YouTube comedy series, has won them over with its smart humor and binge-worthy format.Kylie also mentioned her recent accomplishment—finishing the iconic sitcom Friends, which took her a while since she mostly played it at bedtime or during household chores. It's one of her “comfort” shows, offering familiarity during this physically and emotionally demanding period. As for what's next, she hinted at diving back into two other beloved sitcoms: Parks and Recreation and New Girl.Jason’s taste diverges a bit—he’s recently started watching HBO’s White Lotus, a critically acclaimed anthological comedy-drama. “Outside of that, Jason is watching some shows at night, I just finished Friends... I think I’m due for either Parks and Rec or New Girl. I think Jason just started watching the new season of White Lotus,” Kylie shared.However, joining Jason for late-night episodes hasn’t been easy for Kylie. Recovering from childbirth and dealing with fatigue, hormonal shifts, and the exhaustion that comes with caring for a newborn, she finds herself unable to focus or stay awake. “Turn-it-on-so-you-can-fall-asleep” shows have become her go-to.While White Lotus may remain a solo watch for Jason for now, Kylie is taking comfort in familiar stories that offer warmth without requiring too much energy—perfect for this beautiful, chaotic season of new beginnings.Also Read: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce skip coachella without explanation, fueling breakup rumors as insiders blame album obsession","Kylie and jason kelce have recently welcomed their fourth daughter.

Bezos relocates to Florida, invests $237 million in Indian Creek estates

Two adjacent properties for $147 million

A third estate purchased in 2023 for $90 million

In a landmark real estate transaction that has captured national attention, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has sold his Hunts Point mansion in Washington for a staggering $63 million. This record-breaking deal has now become the most expensive residential sale in Washington State history, as reported by the Puget Sound Business Journal.The sale not only highlights the enduring appeal of ultra-luxury real estate but also marks a symbolic departure for Bezos from the Pacific Northwest—a region where he built his tech empire. The timing of the sale is also noteworthy, occurring just days before Bezos’ aerospace firm, Blue Origin, completed a high-profile spaceflight carrying an all-female crew, including his fiancée Lauren Sánchez and pop star Katy Perry.Located on the prestigious Hunts Point peninsula along the shores of Lake Washington, the 9,420-square-foot estate boasts three bedrooms and four bathrooms. Originally owned by the late art collector Barney Ebsworth, the home was purchased by Bezos in 2019 for $37.5 million through a trust—an arrangement often used by high-net-worth individuals for privacy.The modern estate features:Jeff Bezos acquired the property in 2019 shortly after his divorce from MacKenzie Scott. The purchase was one of several real estate investments made in the Seattle area during that period. Last week’s $63 million sale surpasses the previous state record for residential property sales, eclipsing 2023’s top transaction—a $38.9 million estate in nearby Medina.This sale marks Bezos’ first major move to divest from his Seattle-area portfolio, although he still retains ownership of a 30,000-square-foot Tudor-style estate known as the La Haye mansion, which he purchased in 2010 for $45 million. In 1998, he also acquired an adjacent property for an additional $10 million.Bezos’ decision to sell the Hunts Point property follows his announcement in December 2023 that he would be relocating to Florida. In a heartfelt Instagram post, he reflected on his decades in Seattle, stating:“I’ve lived in Seattle longer than I’ve lived anywhere else and have so many amazing memories here. As exciting as the move is, it’s an emotional decision for me. Seattle, you will always have a piece of my heart.”Since the announcement, Bezos has purchased multiple properties on Miami’s exclusive Indian Creek Island—commonly known as “Billionaire’s Island.” His acquisitions there total approximately $237 million, including:","Amazon founder jeff bezos has sold his hunts point mansion in washington for a staggering $63 million.

Mixing ingredients not only results in a variety of unique effects but also adds a layer of excitement and strategy as you aim to cater to the specific tastes of your clientele. While some recipes are well-known, others are hidden gems that offer bizarre or powerful effects. Here, we’ll explore three unique mixing recipes in Schedule 1 that you may not have tried yet.One of the more humorous effects you can achieve in Schedule 1 is the Shrinking effect.

While it may sound absurd, it can prove useful in certain situations where speed and agility are key. Here’s how to make it:This concoction is not only a fun twist on traditional drug effects but also offers players an interesting challenge in crafting such an unusual mix.If you're looking for a truly dangerous and high-risk recipe, the Explosive mix should be on your radar. This recipe causes the consumer to explode, which is not only one of the most dangerous effects in the game but also a dramatic example of how far you can push the limits of the game’s mechanics. While it’s sure to create chaos, it’s definitely a recipe that should be used sparingly. Here’s how to make the explosive brew:Due to its sheer power and risk, this recipe is a must-avoid for most players looking to maintain stability in their drug empire. But for those daring enough to try it, it adds a thrilling challenge to the gameplay.This recipe is one of the most complex and unique combinations available in Schedule 1. The mixture creates a series of effects that include Seizure-Inducing, Electrifying, Anti-Gravity, and Glowing. It’s an overwhelming mix of effects that can be both entertaining and chaotic, especially for NPCs who consume it. The sheer variety of effects makes this a fascinating experiment for players who enjoy creating unpredictable outcomes. The recipe is as follows:This concoction offers a range of effects that can keep both you and your customers on your toes. With a little bit of experimentation, it might just turn out to be the perfect high for your high-profile clientele.Schedule 1 provides a unique and humorous approach to drug manufacturing within the game, allowing players to experiment with a wide range of ingredients and effects.

A new artificial intelligence trend is sweeping across social media, blending nostalgia, digital creativity, and personalization. Dubbed the “ChatGPT Action Figure Trend,” this phenomenon is giving users the opportunity to create hyper-realistic images of themselves as collectible dolls or action figures—complete with toy box packaging, accessories, and thematic designs. The viral trend is powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT , which now includes image generation capabilities through DALL·E, enabling users to craft customized toy-like avatars using a combination of uploaded photos and descriptive prompts.This trend follows a series of internet-wide moments in which AI tools, particularly ChatGPT, have enabled viral self-expression—such as Studio Ghibli-inspired portraits and AI-generated yearbook photos. The recent rise in ChatGPT traffic—reaching a record 184.4 million global visits on April 9, 2025, according to Similarweb—indicates not just interest in generative AI, but its growing cultural relevance in user-led digital art and identity play.Here’s everything to know about the ChatGPT action figure trend , how it works, what platforms are driving it, and why it's capturing the imagination of millions.The ChatGPT Action Figure Trend is a user-generated movement where individuals use AI to design digital images of themselves as action figures or Barbie-style dolls. The characters often appear inside a branded toy box, accompanied by miniature accessories, clothing, and backdrops that reflect the user’s personality, profession, or hobbies.While there is no confirmed origin for the trend, it rapidly gained traction on TikTok, X (formerly Twitter), Instagram, and Reddit. The posts typically show the AI-generated doll and its box art, along with a caption describing the user's design choices. Some themes parody pop culture archetypes—like “Corporate Coffee Warrior” or “Freelance Chaos Coder”—while others take a more sincere, biographical approach.The trend taps into both nostalgia and novelty. For many, it recalls childhood memories of unboxing dolls or action figures, now merged with cutting-edge AI customization. The result is a quirky but powerful form of self-representation.To start, users need a ChatGPT account. The feature works best on the ChatGPT Plus plan, which includes GPT-4 and access to image generation tools like DALL·E 3. Free-tier users have limited access to image prompts and cannot upload personal images directly.Users can upload a selfie or a full-body photograph to help the AI better understand facial features, body proportions, and attire. The image is used by ChatGPT to render a more accurate digital likeness.Users then enter a detailed prompt instructing the AI to generate a toy box image of themselves. The prompt can include:Within seconds to a few minutes, ChatGPT generates an image that matches the description. The final result often looks like a professional marketing photo for a real-life toy.The success of the ChatGPT Action Figure Trend can be attributed to several factors:While fun and engaging, the trend has some caveats:Additionally, concerns have been raised about the long-term ethical implications of AI-generated identity manipulation and the use of personal data in training models—although OpenAI maintains that user-uploaded images are not used to train future models.","Chatgpt action figure trend is a user-generated movement where individuals use ai to design digital images of themselves as action figures or barbie-style dolls.

Melinda French Gates has opened up about her 2021 divorce from Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates, calling the split “necessary” despite her ex-husband recently describing it as the biggest regret of his life. In a January interview, Bill Gates said ending their 27-year marriage was ""at the top of the list"" when it came to personal failures. The couple, who married in 1994, officially parted ways in August 2021.Recently, in a candid interview with The Times, French Gates addressed those comments, saying: “If you can’t live your values out inside your most intimate relationship, it was necessary.” While she chose not to directly respond to her ex-husband’s remarks, she noted: “I don’t even quite know what to make of that statement, so I’m not going to comment on what he says. He’s got his own life. I have my life now. I am very happy.”French Gates also spoke about the emotional toll of the divorce, revealing she suffered panic attacks during the separation. “When you’re leaving a marriage, it’s very, very hard. And the negotiations were tough,” she said.She shared that her first panic attack occurred in 2014 while having lunch with Gates, prompting her to begin therapy. “I’d heard of people having panic attacks and I didn’t know if it was a real thing,” she said.Initially skeptical of therapy, French Gates admitted she later came to understand its value. “It doesn’t mean I’m damaged,” she explained. “It means I’ve been through some difficult things that I need to figure out.”The former couple share three adult children—Jennifer, 28, Rory, 25, and Phoebe, 22—and are now grandparents to two. While Bill Gates has been dating Paula Hurd, widow of former Oracle CEO Mark Hurd, since 2022, French Gates confirmed she is currently single and enjoying the dating scene.","Melinda french gates has opened up about her 2021 divorce from bill gates.

Apple again surpasses Microsoft as most valuable company

US President Donald Trump has asserted his direct involvement in securing a relief for Apple as the tech giant’s stock experienced a surge of over 2%, propelling its market capitalisation back above the $3 trillion mark. The iPhone maker experienced this surge after the Trump administration announced temporary tariff exemptions on phones, computers and chips.“I speak to Tim Cook. I helped Tim Cook , recently, and that whole business,” Trump said on Monday (April 14) in a briefing with reporters in the Oval Office, referring to Apple’s CEO.“I don’t want to hurt anybody, but the end result is we’re going to get to the position of greatness for our country,” he added.Trump's comment underscored his administration’s decision to exempt phones, computers and chips (semiconductors) from newly-imposed tariffs, a move crucial for Apple, which manufactures the majority of its iPhones, iPads and MacBooks in China, India and other Asian countries. The President has urged Apple to shift its production locally.However, administration officials have cautioned that these exemptions are temporary, leaving Apple's future tariff burden uncertain.As per CNBC, analysts at Morgan Stanley indicated that the latest developments have reduced Apple's “annualised tariff cost burden” from $44 billion to $7 billion.Nevertheless, Apple has reclaimed its position as the most valuable publicly traded US company, surpassing Microsoft. This followed a dip below the $3 trillion threshold on April 4, triggered by Trump's announcement of “reciprocal tariffs” that would significantly impact China and other manufacturing hubs.Reports said that Apple transported over 1.5 million iPhones aboard six cargo planes from India to minimise the impact of tariffs. Projections indicated that the iPhones that cost $1,599 (top-end iPhone 16 Pro Max in the US) could have surged to $2,300 under the high tariff rate that had been in effect, if Apple imported the phones from China.","Donald trump exempts phones, computers, and chips from newly imposed tariffs.

On Monday, April 14, an all-female crew including NASA rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, astronaut Amanda Nguyen, filmmaker Kerianne Flynn, and celebrities Lauren Sánchez, Katy Perry , and Kelly King will launch on Amazon founder Jeff Bezos-owned Blue Origin ’s first all-female space mission. The historic flight, departing around 9:30 a.m. ET, marks a milestone for Jeff Bezos ’ company, with the crew wearing custom-designed astronaut suits by Monse.The suits, crafted from flame-resistant stretch neoprene, were tailored to each woman’s body using 3-D scans for a precise fit. Sanchez, 55, collaborated with Monse co-founders Fernando Garcia and Laura Kim starting in late 2024 to design suits that balance function with style. “Usually, these suits are made for a man,” Sánchez told The New York Times, explaining that previous suits were merely tailored for women. The new designs include features like calf zippers for flared legs, aiming to be both flattering and functional.Sánchez described the suits as “elegant” with “a little spice,” while Garcia cited motocross outfits and ski suits as inspirations, emphasizing simplicity with a “dangerous” edge. “I almost put a corset in your suit,” Garcia teased Sánchez, who said she would have embraced it. Sánchez stressed the importance of functionality, recalling prototype tests where she stretched and bent to ensure durability, saying, “Let’s make sure it doesn’t split up the back in space.”The crew also shared their pre-flight glam plans with Elle. “Who would not get glam before the flight?!” Sánchez said, noting they’ll wear lash extensions in the capsule. Perry, 40, added, “Space is going to finally be glam. We are going to put the ‘ass’ in astronaut.” King, 70, joined in the excitement for their stylish space debut.Announced in February 2025, the mission highlights a shift toward inclusivity in space exploration, with the crew’s custom suits symbolizing both innovation as well as empowerment.","An all-female crew including nasa rocket scientist aisha bowe, astronaut amanda nguyen, filmmaker kerianne flynn, and celebrities lauren sánchez, katy perry, and kelly king will launch on amazon founder jeff bezos-owned blue origin ’s first all- female space mission.

‘Clean cars, courteous drivers’: A model that worked, until it didn’t

Drivers in limbo: ‘We don’t own the cars. What now?’

Sebi crackdown

Legal experts: Document your wallet funds, seek refund

NEW DELHI: With over 8,500 electric vehicles , more than 5,800 charging stations and a network of 10,000 active drivers, BluSmart carved out a niche in the urban commute landscape across Delhi-NCR, Mumbai and Bengaluru. But on Wednesday, the EV ride-hailing platform appeared to have gone dark leaving thousands of regular users stranded and its fleet largely off the roads.BluSmart’s rise had been swift and steady. Launched in 2019, the platform carved out a niche in a market long dominated by Ola and Uber, offering an eco-friendly alternative with fixed fares, reliable rides, and clean vehicles.Read related story: Commuters in Bengaluru, NCR get the blues as e-cab firm BluSmart pulls plug For many passengers, it became a daily commuting mainstay. But its sudden suspension came after markets regulator Sebi barred the promoters of Gensol Engineering, BluSmart’s promoter company, from participating in the securities market over allegations of fund diversion and governance lapses.On Wednesday, several users across Delhi, Gurugram, Noida, Bengaluru and Mumbai reported being unable to make bookings on the BluSmart app.In most cases, the date and time slots failed to load, and bookings wouldn’t go through.Some drivers told TOI they were able to complete only pre-scheduled rides during the day, while others said they received messages from the company asking them not to report to work on Thursday.The company did not issue any statement till late evening. When contacted, a BluSmart spokesperson declined to comment.For thousands of commuters, the sudden unavailability of BluSmart threw daily travel plans into disarray. “I couldn’t book a ride at 9 am. The app wouldn’t load slots. I later learnt my colleagues were facing the same issue,” said Priyanshi Saha, a Cyber Hub professional who lives in Sector 56, Gurugram. “This was the only service that had standard fares and was eco-friendly.”Jagriti Kumar, an IT professional living near Dwarka Expressway, said BluSmart was her only reliable option to reach her office in Udyog Vihar. “It was consistent, never cancelled last minute, and charged Rs 400-450 every time. I’ll now be at the mercy of surge pricing and erratic drivers on other platforms.”Several long-time users said they were also worried about the money stuck in their BluSmart app wallets. “I have Rs 1,700 in the wallet. There has been no communication about refunds,” said Abhijeet Ghosh, a central Delhi resident. Others like Kanika Tomar (Rs 2,500) and Ashish Malik (Rs 760) echoed similar concerns. “The silence from the company is unsettling,” said Kanika.Launched in 2019, BluSmart pitched itself as a zero-emission ride service built on a fleet-ownership model. Unlike Ola and Uber, where drivers owned or leased vehicles, BluSmart owned its EVs and employed drivers on fixed pay with incentives. Riders were offered clean, noiseless cars, punctual pick-ups and fixed fares—factors that helped it earn a loyal following.Read related story: SEBI crackdown: BluSmart cab users left stranded in Delhi-NCR, Bangalore and Mumbai “The drivers were always polite. There was no noise, no haggling, and no last-minute cancellations. I often chatted with the drivers—most were satisfied with their work,” said Ghosh, who used BluSmart for nearly two years.Rachit Gupta, who commuted daily between Delhi and Gurugram, said the well-maintained fleet and punctual service had kept him hooked. “It was the best alternative to the chaos of Ola-Uber,” he said.For drivers, the disruption could prove even more damaging. Since BluSmart owns the fleet, many drivers say they have little clarity about what lies ahead. “We were told a vendor would check our cars tomorrow and that we shouldn’t report to work,” said Dileep, a driver waiting at IGI’s T3 terminal. “If the company shuts down, we can’t switch to other platforms. We don’t own the cars.”Arun, another driver from Faridabad, said he was paid Rs 3,200-4,300 for 10–12 hour shifts, with daily bonuses. “It was a good system. I didn’t get any bookings today. I don’t know what happens next,” he said.The disruption in services followed Sebi’s interim order on Tuesday, in which it alleged that Anmol and Puneet Singh Jaggi diverted funds raised via loans meant for buying EVs for BluSmart, and used part of the money to purchase a luxury apartment in Gurugram. The order also flagged other governance lapses, including transactions with related parties and misuse of corporate funds.The regulator barred both promoters from accessing the securities market and from holding director or KMP positions at Gensol until further notice. Gensol was also directed to put its proposed stock split on hold.With Gensol’s troubles mounting, questions have now been raised about BluSmart’s financial and operational sustainability. While the EV platform is legally a separate entity, its close ties to the promoters have prompted speculation about its future, especially after reports that it was considering partnering with Uber to become a fleet supplier—an option analysts say may now be difficult post Sebi’s crackdown.Consumer lawyer Aditya Parolia advised users to document wallet balances with screenshots and immediately write to the company seeking refunds. “This will help them establish claims if any third-party administrator takes over. The issue raises larger concerns about startup governance and consumer liability,” he said.","Blusmart, the ev ride-hailing service, abruptly suspended operations.

BluSmart , India's first cab company with an all-electric fleet, suddenly pulled the plug on its services on Wednesday, leaving its users in Delhi-NCR scrambling for alternatives and its drivers - many of whom had no idea they had reached a dead end - in the lurch.The Gurgaon-headquartered company, which also had a major presence in Bengaluru, suspended services a day after market watchdog Sebi banned brothers Anmol and Puneet Singh Jaggi from the securities market for alleged misappropriation of funds in Gensol Engineering, the company they co-founded.Anmol is also co-founder of BluSmart.Abrupt suspension of BluSmart’s service caused a commuting crisis for many. One of them is Jagriti Kumar, a Gurgaon-based IT professional. “Where I live, near Dwarka Expressway, cabs are the only viable public transport. BluSmart was the only one I could rely on to get to my office in Udyog Vihar. Cancellations were rare, and the fare consistent at Rs 400-450. I will now be at the mercy of unpredictable surge pricing and drivers of other services who often cancel,” she told TOI on Wednesday afternoon as office goers tried to book rides but the BluSmart app would not take any bookings.Priyanshi Saha , who works in Cyber Hub, is another. Priyanshi used BluSmart because it had standard fares and she preferred a non-polluting EV. “I tried to book and could not as the date and time slots would not show up. I called my friends who also had the same experience,” said Saha , who lives in Sector 56.Abhijeet Ghosh, who works in central Delhi, said he discovered BluSmart after the pandemic when he returned to work and found it to be a “fabulous experience, barring the rare occasion”. “I was a regular user for two years. The drivers came before time, were polite, the a/c functioned, and the car made no noise. It was far superior to other cab aggregator services in Delhi. I would often converse with drivers and a majority seemed to be reasonably happy with the employer. The charges for fund siphoning must be investigated. But it is sad that a good car service has been shut down,” said Abhijeet, who too started reading up to understand what had happened after his booking would not go through on Wednesday evening.“For me, BluSmart stood for its reliability,” said Ashish Malik, a Ghaziabad resident who used the service primarily to travel to and from Delhi airport. “My airport travel is at odd hours and I could always count on them. There were hardly any last-minute cancellations, unlike other apps,” he said.Kanika Tomar, a Noidabased consultant, echoed Abhijeet. “I started using BluSmart after getting fed up with unpredictable pricing and rude drivers on other platforms. It was such a relief to have clean, quiet EVs and courteous drivers,” she said.BluSmart began operations in 2019 as an early bird with the EV industry still nascent and the pandemic yet to come, to capitalise on the potential for an energy transition in public transport.The bet paid off as BluSmart established itself as a differentiated service in Gurgaon and Delhi, its USP not just a noiseless electric fleet, but clean cars and a punctual service. In a highly competitive market dominated by Uber and Ola, it carved its own niche and aloyal user base.Rachit Gupta said well-behaved drivers and clean cars were what got him hooked to BluSmart in 2022. “I used it for my daily commute between Delhi and Gurgaon. The cars always came on time,” said Rachit, adding the service should continue.BluSmart regulars were also worried about funds in their wallets on the app. Kanika said she had Rs 2,500 in it, Ashish Rs 760 and Abhijeet Rs 1,700. “There’s been no communication from the company about what happens next,” said Kanika.Somil Aggarwal , a Gurgaon-based marketing professional, said he had read about the company’s troubles in recent weeks but hadn’t thought services would stop. “We will be back to services where cabs are not always clean, drivers can be rude, and cancellations happen last-minute,” he said.Aditya Parolia, a Supreme Court lawyer who has fought numerous consumer cases, said all customers should immediately email the company for a refund. “The situation raises various questions on the functioning of startups and their liability towards all interested parties. All consumers should immediately write to the company and make a record with evidence, which can be a simple snapshot of the wallet. This will help ascertain their claim in case the company management is taken up by any other company,” explained Parolia.The blow was a lot harder for BluSmart drivers, many of whom had no clue when they started their workday that it could be their last. Some drivers TOI correspondents spoke to were under the impression that the app was glitching. Others said they had only picked up pre-booked passengers on Wednesday.The parking bay the company had at T3 in IGI was empty. A few cabs idled in the vacuous space, the boards, signage, and passengers gone. One of the drivers present there, Di leep, said he received a message from the company asking him not to report on Thursday. “We were told a vendor would be checking the cabs, so we’re not supposed to take them out on Thursday,” said Dileep.In BluSmart’s case, the company owns the cars and drivers collect wages. “If the company shuts down, many of us will be in trouble. We don’t own the cars and can’t just shift to other platforms,” Dileep said.Arun, a driver from Faridabad, said, “We were paid Rs 3,200 for a 10-hour shift and Rs 4,300 for a 12-hour one. There were also daily bonuses for meeting targets. It was a good system. I’m not sure what’s happening now as I didn’t get any rides on Wednesday.”The development comes a day after markets regulator Sebi barred the two promoters of Gensol Anmol Singh Jaggi and Puneet Singh Jaggi from the securities market until further notice due to fund misappropriation and governance issues. Both the promoters have also been barred from serving as directors or in any key managerial position at Gensol.Sebi’s investigation revealed that Anmol and Puneet Singh Jaggi had used part of the funds that were raised through loans for buying electric cars for BluSmart to purchase a luxury flat in Gurgaon. The promoters had also channelised the funds to related parties and used the same for unrelated expenses.The turn of events at Gensol has raised concerns over the viability of BluSmart which had been able to offer consumers a different choice in a mobility market otherwise being dominated by largely Uber and Ola. The firm which was understood to be considering becoming a fleet partner of rival Uber may find it difficult to reach such an arrangement after the Sebi crackdown on Gensol, analysts said.","Blusmart, india's first cab company with an all-electric fleet, suddenly pulled the plug on its services on wednesday.

What is a DDoS attack?

Video conferencing platform Zoom faced a major global outage on Friday, disrupting core services including video meetings, its website, and mobile applications. Zoom Communications later said it had resolved the issue, which left tens of thousands of users worldwide unable to connect.At the peak of the disruption around 3:01 p.m. ET, Downdetector.com — which tracks service outages — reported as many as 67,280 user complaints, primarily from the United States but also from several other countries. Users encountered error code 503 , commonly linked to server-side issues.“Service has now been restored after the earlier outage,” Zoom confirmed on X (formerly Twitter), after earlier acknowledging “domain name resolution issues on the zoom.us domain that is affecting multiple services.”The company is still investigating the cause of the outage and has not officially confirmed whether it was a cyberattack. However, several users on social media claimed that a hacking group named DarkStorm was behind a DDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attack targeting Zoom.“We do work on USA platforms as we said,” the group posted on X, prompting further speculation. Zoom has yet to comment on the alleged attack.According to Zoom’s status page, the disruption impacted multiple services including Zoom Meetings, Zoom Phone, Zoom Contact Center, and the company’s main website. Downdetector also recorded over 50,000 problem reports during the incident.A Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack is a malicious attempt to disrupt the normal functioning of a target server, service, or network by overwhelming it with a flood of internet traffic. Unlike a traditional Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack, which typically comes from a single source, a DDoS attack originates from multiple sources, often using thousands of compromised devices such as computers, smartphones, and IoT (Internet of Things) devices. These devices, collectively known as a ""botnet,"" are controlled remotely by cybercriminals without the knowledge of their owners.The goal of a DDoS attack is to exhaust the resources of the target system, making it unable to respond to legitimate requests. This can cause the targeted website, service, or network to slow down, become unavailable, or crash entirely. DDoS attacks can affect any online service, including websites, applications, and cloud-based platforms.DDoS attacks are difficult to defend against due to their distributed nature. The sheer volume of traffic can overwhelm even the most advanced security systems. Businesses and organizations often implement various strategies, such as traffic filtering and load balancing, to mitigate the impact of these attacks.","Zoom faced a major global outage on friday, disrupting core services including video meetings, its website, and mobile applications.
