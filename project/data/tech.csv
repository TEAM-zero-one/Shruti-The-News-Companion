around world

NEW DELHI: After the breakthrough in developing a hyperloop test track (422m) by IIT Madras with support from Indian Railways , the government is now planning development of a 50km corridor for commercial transport, said minister Ashwini Vaishnaw . It may be the longest hyperloop track in the world.""The first tube will go a long way in developing technologies. The time has come when after the first two grants of $1million each (nearly ₹9cr), the third grant of $1million will be given to IIT Madras for further developing the hyperloop project in a nice way. And once we see the commercial or rather pre-commercial where the product is ready, then within the railway set-up we will start the first commercial project. We will decide a site, which can be used for good commercial transportation of 40km-50km and then we will go for it,"" Vaishnaw said while addressing the closing ceremony of Asia's first Global Hyperloop Competition by IIT Madras.Sources said the test track for commercial operation will help railways assess viability of the technology. The hyperloop track can allow speeds of up to 1,200kmph. The successful development of the first test track, which was completed in Dec last year, will be the base for future development.Hyperloop systems are expected to dramatically reduce travel times between cities, offering an alternative to traditional rail and air travel. The hyperloop concept envisions high-speed, low-pressure pods travelling at speeds of up to 1,200 kmph.The hyperloop system was first conceptualised by Swiss professor Marcel Juffer in the 1970s. In 1992, Swissmetro SA was set up to develop this project, but it went into liquidation in 2009. At present, there are eight promising hyperloop projects in the world, including Virgin Hyperloop which has been actively testing its systems in Nevada. Canadian firm TransPod is also constructing a test track to validate their design.In an official statement, the railway ministry said IIT-Madras and railways will also work together on vertical take-off landing vehicles.","The government is planning development of a 50km corridor for commercial transport.

On Jan 29, India witnessed Isro's 100th rocket launch when GSLV-F15 rocket launched navigation satellite NVS-02. He urged people to observe National Science Day by spending “One Day as a Scientist”, which he said will foster curiosity among children and youth about science.On the country’s space sector achievements, Modi said, “Champions Trophy is going on these days and there is an atmosphere of cricket for everyone. We all know the thrill of a century in cricket. But today, I am not going to talk about cricket, rather I will talk about the wonderful century that India has made in space. Last month, the country was a witness to Isro's 100th rocket launch. This is not just a number, but it shows our resolve to achieve ever-new heights in space science. Our space journey started in a very normal manner. There were challenges in every step, but our scientists continued moving forward achieving victory over them.”“With time, the list of our achievements in space flights continues to grow longer. Be it building a launch vehicle, success of Chandrayaan, Mangalyaan and Aditya L1 or carrying out the unprecedented mission of sending 104 satellites into space in one go with one rocket. The ambit of Isro's success has been quite large. In the past 10 years, around 460 satellites have been launched, in which many satellites of other countries are also included,"" the PM said.On growing women’s power in the industry, Modi said, “The participation of women power has been continuously rising in the space sector. I feel very happy seeing that today the space sector has become a favourite of the youth. For our youth who want to do something thrilling and exciting in their life, the space sector is becoming an excellent option for them.""Speaking about National Science Day 2025, which will be celebrated on Feb 28, the PM said that the interest and passion of youth in science matters a lot. ""You try to spend one day as a scientist. You must visit places like a research lab, planetarium or space centre that day. This will increase your curiosity about science. Like space and science, India is rapidly making its mark in another field. That is AI (Artificial intelligence). I went to Paris to take part in an AI summit. There, people lauded India's strides in the field of AI,"" PM Modi said.He also mentioned a teacher from Telangana, Thodasam Kailash, who is harnessing AI technology in digital song and music to help preserve the tribal languages, including Kolami. His tracks are being liked a lot by the tribal people. ""People of India are second to none in adopting and using new technologies,"" he said.","Pm narendra modi hailed isro, saying it has hit the century in space.

PUNE: The first cases of avian influenza virus (H5N1) in domestic cats in India were reported from Chhindwara district in Madhya Pradesh, raising concerns about the bird flu pathogen mutating and infecting humans.""H5N1 is classically an avian virus, but certain mutations allow it to replicate in mammalian hosts. This adaptability raises concerns because influenza viruses have the potential to trigger pandemics, as seen in past outbreaks like Covid-19,"" a scientist said. Scientists from ICAR-NIHSAD and Union govt's animal husbandry department have documented the cases this Jan in Chhindwara, which borders Nagpur - where several big cats died of bird flu in Dec last year.The scientific team identified the virus as belonging to the 2.3.2.1a lineage, a variant of H5N1 that has caused outbreaks in poultry across India. ""These cases represent the first documented instances of this particular strain infecting domestic cats in India,"" the study says.It found that all infected cats exhibited symptoms such as high fever, loss of appetite, and lethargy before succumbing to the illness within one to three days after sample collection. The study identified 27 mutations in the virus found in cats. Scientists called for enhanced surveillance in domestic poultry, wild birds, and mammals, including pets and humans, given the virus's ability to jump between species.""Although human infections have been rare, we must anticipate the virus adapting to efficient transmission to and between humans. Human-to-human transmission is still not efficient, but ongoing changes in the virus signal to us to stay vigilant and prepared even for a pandemic,"" virologist Jacob John said. On the virus's potential to cause a global outbreak, John cautioned: ""H5N1 is new for humans. We do not have immunity against it. If human-to-human transmission becomes efficient, as an extension of the present pattern of mammalian transmission, it is going to be a concern.""","The first cases of avian influenza virus (h5n1) in domestic cats in india were reported from chhindwara district in madhya pradesh.

Trump's $5 Million Gold Card Visa: Impact on Indians in Green Card Backlogs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trumps-5-million-gold-card-visa-what-it-means-for-indians-stuck-in-green-card-backlogs/articleshow/118570216.cms,"Donald Trump (File photo)

Here are the common FAQs:



Q: What is the 'gold card' visa, and how does it differ from a traditional green card?

Q: How will the gold card impact Indian nationals waiting for green cards?

Offer a faster route for wealthy Indians who can afford it.

Exclude middle-tier investors who previously used EB-5 as an alternative to employment-based green cards.

Shift focus from job creation to wealth, favouring Indian business tycoons over skilled professionals.

Q: Will the gold card replace the EB-5 investor visa program?

Q: Can Indians currently on H-1B or EB-2/EB-3 visas apply for the gold card?

Q: How will this affect Indians who were considering the EB-5 visa?

Q: How many gold cards will be available, and will there be a cap like EB-5?

Q: Could Indian tech CEOs, startup founders, or business leaders benefit from the gold card?

Q: Will the gold card need congressional approval, or can Trump implement it directly?

Q: What are the risks associated with the gold card?

Uncertainty: Details on processing, vetting, and long-term benefits are still vague.

Legal challenges: Congress or courts may challenge its legality.

Affordability: At $5 million, it excludes many Indians who could afford EB-5 but not this steep jump.

Q: What other options do Indians have if the gold card is too expensive?

Is the gold card a game-changer for Indians?

The gold card presents a fast-track residency option—but only for India’s ultra-rich. For the broader Indian diaspora, especially H-1B holders and EB-5 investors, it signals a shift toward wealth-based immigration, leaving most to navigate the backlogged employment-based system. While it may be an attractive shortcut for billionaires and corporate-backed talent, for the majority, it represents a roadblock rather than a solution.

(With inputs from agencies)

President Donald Trump’s proposal to introduce a $5 million ""gold card"" visa as a replacement for the EB-5 investor program has sparked major concerns among Indian nationals waiting for US green cards . With over 1 million Indians stuck in employment-based backlogs—some for over 50 years—the shift toward a wealth-based immigration model could drastically reshape their options.President Donald Trump has proposed a new ""gold card"" visa, which would grant green card privileges and a pathway to US citizenship for a $5 million fee. Unlike the traditional EB-5 investor visa, which requires a $800,000-$1.05 million investment in a business that creates at least 10 US jobs, the gold card has no such job creation requirement. Instead, it is being positioned as a premium residency option for wealthy individuals.Indians are among the largest groups waiting for US green cards, with backlogs exceeding 50 years in some employment-based categories. The gold card could:Yes. Commerce secretary Howard Lutnick confirmed that the gold card would replace EB-5 in two weeks. Trump criticized EB-5, calling it “full of nonsense, make-believe, and fraud.” While EB-5 required job creation, the gold card is simply a direct purchase of US residency and citizenship eligibility.Yes, if they have $5 million to pay for it. Trump described the gold card as a ""road to citizenship for people of wealth or people of great talent, where people of wealth pay for those people of talent to get in.” This suggests that companies may also sponsor highly skilled employees, though details remain unclear.For Indians who planned to use EB-5, the fivefold increase in investment cost (from $1 million to $5 million) could make it unaffordable. While EB-5 investors could pool funds or take structured loans, the gold card seems to require upfront cash, limiting accessibility to India’s ultra-rich elite.Trump claimed, ""We’ll be able to sell maybe a million of these cards,"" and even suggested selling 10 million to reduce the US deficit. Unlike EB-5, which had a cap, the gold card appears to have no numerical limit—it is purely a revenue-driven scheme.Yes. The program seems tailored for India’s wealthiest entrepreneurs, tech executives, and industrialists. Those who want to bypass H-1B visa lotteries and EB-2/EB-3 backlogs could find this an attractive alternative. However, its lack of clarity around job creation, business investment, and processing time raises concerns.Trump said that congressional approval is not required, but legal experts disagree. If lawsuits or political opposition arise, implementation could be delayed or blocked—something Indian applicants should consider before committing funds.For those unable to afford the gold card, traditional employment-based green cards (EB-1, EB-2, EB-3) and the H-1B visa remain options, although processing times are long. If the gold card significantly reduces EB-5 interest, Indians already in the EB-5 pipeline may have fewer competitors, potentially improving their chances.","President donald trump has proposed a new ""gold card"" visa, which would grant green card privileges and a pathway to us citizenship for a $5 million fee.

(With inputs from PTI)

PRAYAGRAJ/NEW YORK: Harvard professors have highlighted the unique blend of tradition and technology , as well as the intersection of commerce and spirituality , at the Maha Kumbh. Speaking at a special discussion titled 'Insights from the World's Largest Spiritual Gathering - Maha Kumbh', organised by the Consulate General of India in New York, they shared their observations on the world’s largest religious gathering, which concludes on Wednesday.The discussion featured Tarun Khanna, Jorge Paulo Lemann Professor at Harvard Business School; Diana Eck, Professor of Comparative Religion and Indian Studies at the Harvard Divinity School; and Tiona Zuzul, Assistant Professor of Business Administration at Harvard Business School.They reflected on their on-ground research from the 2013 Kumbh Mela and the key takeaways from this year's event, including aspects of spirituality, administration, engineering, and the integration of technology with tradition.Addressing the gathering, Khanna emphasised the scale, sanitation, and technological advancements seen at the Maha Kumbh.""I, personally as a scholar, am fascinated by the coexistence of tradition and technology because that's how society is developed. We keep some things core to us, that's a tradition that stays,"" news agency PTI quoted Khanna as saying, adding that layers of technology are built upon these traditions over time.He noted that Kumbh Mela serves as a remarkable example of how technology is incorporated into religious practices. Calling the event a “fascinating place” for observing this integration, he pointed out advancements such as the digitisation of the ""lost and found"" services, describing it as ""super interesting"" since ""it speaks directly to this idea of tradition and technology.""Khanna also praised the cleanliness of this year's Kumbh, stating, ""The 2025 Kumbh is called the 'Swachh Kumbh' and it is incredibly clean.""Eck focused on the logistical and structural aspects of the gathering, saying, ""What astonished us more than anything was just the astonishing fact that this city is built in such a short time."" She highlighted the scale of infrastructure, including electricity substations, engineering teams, health services, and small businesses that spring up to support the event.She also pointed to the craftsmanship behind the temporary structures at the Kumbh, where skilled builders erect tents using just four or five materials within days. ""The Kumbh Mela is a good example of the ability to create simple structures with simple materials and do it quickly. There is a lot that various places in the world can learn from this,"" she said, drawing parallels to the need for similar encampments for large refugee populations.Eck further described the technological innovations at Kumbh as ""extraordinary.""Zuzul, who first visited India in 2013 as part of Eck’s research team, spoke about the evolution of businesses and economic opportunities at Kumbh. She expressed interest in seeing how commerce and spirituality continue to develop at future gatherings. ""I'm really excited to understand how this intersection of commerce and spirituality will evolve. It is important for the government, and larger and local businesses, to think about what kind of Kumbh we want to create. What sorts of commercial opportunities do we need to provide, and what does that mean for the spiritual essence of the religious gathering?"" she said.Khanna suggested that organisers should focus on documenting and passing down knowledge from one Kumbh to the next on a yearly basis rather than only at six- or twelve-year intervals.When asked about key takeaways from this year’s Kumbh and areas for improvement, Zuzul was particularly impressed by the infrastructure planning. ""Something that really impressed me this year was just the thought that went into creating the infrastructure to allow for a successful and orderly Kumbh, whether it's the number of toilets that were built or the Artificial Intelligence cameras that could count the number of people present in any given place,"" she said.She also noted that influencing human behaviour takes time and cannot always be achieved through structural improvements alone. ""I suspect that what we'll see in future years are more attempts to influence how people behave in this space in a more emergent way,"" she added.The Maha Kumbh Mela , which began in Prayagraj at the confluence of the Ganges, Yamuna, and mythical Sarasvati on January 13, concludes on Mahashivratri. According to the Uttar Pradesh government, a record 600 million devotees have taken a holy dip in the Triveni Sangam so far.Summing up the spiritual essence of the gathering, Eck said, ""Basically, this is it. It is the river itself for which people come. That is the cathedral, that is the temple, that is the destination.""","Harvard professors highlight blend of tradition and technology at maha kumbh.

Amazon unveiled Alexa+, its long-awaited AI-powered voice assistant, on Wednesday after more than a year of delays. The upgraded assistant will be available in the coming weeks in the US, and Prime members can have it for free or others can pay $19.99 monthly for it.The new assistant represents a complete redesign, transforming Alexa from a simple command-response tool into a conversational AI agent capable of autonomously completing complex tasks. Alexa+ can make restaurant reservations, order groceries, control smart home devices , and navigate web services with minimal user supervision.""Until this moment – right this moment — we have been limited by the technology,"" said Panos Panay, Amazon's SVP of Devices & Services, during the New York launch event.Originally announced in September 2023, Alexa+ faced significant development hurdles that pushed its release from early 2024 to now. Internal testing reportedly revealed problems with accuracy and functionality that required extensive revisions.The assistant combines multiple AI models, including Amazon's Nova model and others from companies like Anthropic. It integrates with numerous third-party services such as OpenTable, Spotify, Grubhub, Uber Eats, and Ticketmaster.Amazon will begin rolling out early access next month, prioritizing Echo Show 8, 10, 15, and 21 device owners. The assistant will be accessible through compatible Echo devices , a new mobile app, and a browser-based experience at Alexa.com.The Alexa+ positions Amazon against competitive AI offerings including OpenAI's ChatGPT, Google's Gemini, and Apple's forthcoming Siri improvements, but it has an advantage here – about 600 million Alexa devices already in homes, and Amazon hopes this upgrade will revitalize its consumer electronics division, which has reportedly struggled to generate significant revenue despite widespread adoption.","Alexa+ can make restaurant reservations, order groceries, control smart home devices and navigate web services with minimal user supervision.

The e-bikes maker is also preparing to enter overseas markets having cleared homologation (roadworthiness certification) for Europe for the F77 Mach2.Valued at $330 million in its last fund-raise in 2022, the company has sold around 1,000 units of the F77 since its launch in 2023.
