Goodbye, Frequent FASTag Recharges! NHAI Launches Annual Pass for Rs 3,000

What is KYV?

The Process

The Pain

If recurring KYCs was not enough, there’s now a KYV that you must go through if you happen to own a vehicle. Short for know your vehicle, this new process that is supposed to sanitise your FASTag is the latest compliance burden to be thrust on Indians.What was the need? Apparently, cases of misuse of FASTags — in some cases by truck drivers who were using tags meant for cars — convinced policy-makers that they needed a nationwide firewall to prevent a bunch of delinquents from misusing FASTags.It was rolled out as a mandatory process, beginning Oct 31, 2024, that requires all FASTag users to submit images of their vehicle and registration certificate to verify that the tag is linked to the correct vehicle. A National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) initiative, KYV was notified by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). To prevent fraud. And if you thought this was a one-time process, you’re wrong. The verification must be repeated every three years so that the database stays always updated. Why? The possibility of misuse, and ingenious delinquents finding more ways to bend the system.A govt official explained that instances had emerged of people keeping loose FASTags in their pockets or wallets, instead of fixing them on their vehicle windshields, “leading to misuse”.“In some cases, tags issued for cars were used on trucks to pay lower toll charges. KYV will put an end to such misuse,” said another official.A source said since the main thrust of the FASTag rollout was to increase its usage so that toll collection became digitised, there may have been some laxity on the part of banks while issuing them. A KYV, said officials, will “help sanitise the system”.“Ensuring a FASTag is assigned to and affixed on the correct category of vehicle, and that it remains active, is crucial as we prepare to roll out multi-lane free flow (MLFF) system of tolling in which vehicles will neither need to stop, nor slow down as there will be no physical barriers, said a road transport ministry official.Govt aims to bring all national highways that have four or more lanes under MLFF tolling in the next 4-5 years. Therefore, according to officials, one vehicle, one tag is so important.Asked why not detect and disable fraudulent tags or penalise those using multiple tags on the same vehicle, there were no clear answers.According to the circular issued by NPCI, all FASTags need to comply with KYV norms. The process mandates linking the FASTag to the unique Vehicle Registration Number (VRN) and chassis number. FASTag issuers, meanwhile, need to follow the one-vehicle-one tag mandate and replace all tags that are more than five years old.So, anyone with a FASTag must upload their vehicle registration certificate (RC), take a picture of their vehicle from the front and upload that along with the FASTtag and vehicle registration number, besides a side image with the tag and vehicle axles. All these, mind you, must be clearly visible.Issuers need to verify this with the VAHAN database, customer mobile number, and data entered by the point-of-sale agent. FASTags without a valid KYV will get automatically deactivated.While there is great conviction among decision-makers that KYV is the right way to go, there are unpleasant surprises galore that the process is throwing up for people, from being stopped at toll plazas and being told FASTag isn’t working because of “non-compliance with KYV”, to encountering an upload process that involves multiple rounds of clicking photos and sharing documents. Adding to frustrations is its propensity to get stuck — a backend that is simply not prepared to handle such a mammoth job — and sending harried users back to square one.“I was told by a toll gate attendant that my FASTag isn’t working because KYV hasn’t been completed. So, I stopped and had to go through the entire process of taking photos and uploading documents from the toll plaza, just so I could drive on without a penalty despite having a legal and functional FASTag. Govt talks about ease of life, ease of travel, ease of business, etc. How is this ease of anything?” a Delhi resident who recently had to do a KYV at a toll plaza in NCR asked.Having seen people struggle through this, govt officials have started telling banks they should not deactivate tags without calling up customers and informing them about the KYV norm. Sources said the issuer bank, not NPCI, is involved in backend processing of KYV documents.A senior road transport ministry official admitted the process needs to be made easier for the people. Another official said that having a similar process across bank portals and a helpline to guide people could be useful.",Kyv was notified by national payments corporation of india (npci) to prevent fraud. The verification must be repeated every three years so that the database stays always updated. Fastags without a valid kyv will get automatically deactivated.

They were also informed how nearly 65% Indians are of less than 35 years and they prefer reels, memes, podcasts and social media conversations.","Citizens don’t distinguish between ministries as for them there is only ‘one govt of india’, p k mishra, principal secretary to pm narendra modi, told the country’s top bureaucrats.

Charlie Kirk’s Super Bowl rival show might be in trouble — Fans think TPUSA’s ‘All American Halftime’ is getting canceled,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/charlie-kirks-super-bowl-rival-show-might-be-in-trouble-fans-think-tpusas-all-american-halftime-is-getting-canceled/articleshow/124883392.cms,"(Image via Getty)

Social media claims the conservative group’s Super Bowl rival event is falling apart — but here’s what’s really happening

What’s actually confirmed so far

Why fans think it might be in trouble

The internet is buzzing again, this time with talk that Turning Point USA’s much-hyped “All American Halftime Show” might not actually happen. The conservative group’s alternative to the official Super Bowl performance was meant to rival Bad Bunny’s upcoming halftime show, but new online chatter claims the project’s in trouble. Some say it’s being scrapped due to low interest and a lack of star power. But here’s the truth: nothing’s been confirmed yet, and the rumors are running faster than the facts.The speculation first popped up on X (formerly Twitter) with posts claiming Turning Point USA couldn’t secure a big enough “right-wing star” to headline the show. A few viral tweets suggested organizers were quietly pulling the plug, but none came from verified or credible sources. No official statement, press release, or event filing from TPUSA mentions a cancellation or delay meaning, for now, this story lives purely in the land of online whispers.Still, the timing of these rumors makes sense. The group announced the event with big energy weeks ago, then went silent. No headliner. No venue. No ticket details. That radio silence was enough to light up social media, leaving fans convinced something was off and now, it seems the buzz was right, with whispers pointing to a full-scale cancellation.Turning Point USA did officially announce the “All American Halftime Show” earlier this month. The plan? To host a family-friendly, patriotic halftime alternative during Super Bowl LX in February 2026, the same show that’ll see Bad Bunny performing on the NFL’s main stage. The event was pitched as a “faith, family, and freedom” moment celebrating American values, with TPUSA founder Charlie Kirk leading the charge.But after that flashy launch, updates dried up fast. As of now, there’s no confirmed location, performer lineup, or streaming partner. That lack of info is what’s fueling the rumor mill, not any confirmed cancellation notice.Many online believe the event’s facing trouble behind the scenes. Posts and memes joke that TPUSA can’t find a “big enough conservative celebrity” to fill the stage, while others point out that similar culture-driven projects by the group haven’t drawn mainstream attention. A few fans even joked, “They can’t even get Kid Rock to pick up the phone.”But others see the silence differently, suggesting the group might be saving announcements for a surprise drop closer to the Super Bowl season. Either way, the mystery has kept both fans and critics guessing.The “All American Halftime Show” was never just a concert, it was a culture statement. Turning Point USA launched it in response to Bad Bunny’s selection as the official NFL halftime performer, which some conservatives labeled “woke.” The group framed its event as the “real America” alternative, spotlighting patriotism and family values. Whether or not it happens, it’s clear that the show has already stirred up the kind of culture-war drama the internet feeds on.Until Turning Point USA makes an official announcement, the “cancellation” claims remain unverified. No press updates, no confirmation, just social media buzz and a lot of speculation.Also read - Justin Herbert goes viral for looking totally unimpressed during Justin Bieber and Madison Beer’s chat","Social media claims turning point usa's super bowl rival event is falling apart.

'Will hurt spouses of legal immigrants': Major outrage over new US visa EAD rule,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/will-hurt-spouses-of-legal-immigrants-major-outrage-over-new-us-visa-ead-rule/articleshow/124910495.cms,"US ends automatic renewal of Employment Authorization Documents, starting from October 30.

What changes from tomorrow?



Major blow to H-4 visa holders ?







As the US administration announced the end of automatic extension of employment authorization starting from October 30, immigration attorneys questioned the move and asked why the new rule was announced without any notice and public comment period.In a Biden-era rule, certain immigrants can keep working legally even after their work permit expires, as long as they have filed a renewal application on time. From tomorrow, there will be no automatic extension, and there will be a fresh screening and vetting of those workers before their work permit is extended. Migrant workers who file to renew their work permit on or after October 30, 2025 will no longer receive an automatic extension.The administration said that this would allow them to deter fraud and detect aliens with potentially harmful intent.Green card holders and H-1B or O-1 visa holders do not need work permits. But the spouses of H-1Bs, the H-4 visa holders, come under the new work permit rule. Immigration experts raised an alarm that under the new rule which allows no automatic extension if the administration takes too long to process the renewal, which now includes fresh vetting, the applicant will lose their work permit.""Another rule imposed immediately without notice and public comment periods because it is somehow an emergency to stop people from working solely because of government ineptitude,"" David J Bier, immigration expert at the Cato Institute, said.""The Trump Administration is removing automatic extensions for Employment Authorization (EADs), a move that will hurt thousands of H-4 visa holders, mostly highly-skilled spouses of legal immigrants,"" Indian-origin investor Sidharth wrote. ""These are law-abiding families already stuck in endless backlogs. Instead of relief, they get anxiety, uncertainty, and job loss. America shouldn’t punish those who followed the law. Radical voices inside this administration are sabotaging the skilled-immigration system, handing talent and innovation leadership straight to China.""""If proper vetting was actually the issue, why has@USCIS been waiting until people renew their EADs to complete a screening? USCIS can review an alien's background at any point. This just harms the people who are actually following the law and are not a security threat. Also, we wouldn't need automatic extensions of EADs if USCIS would just process the application! It's the agency's own inefficient processing times that created the need for auto extensions in the first place,"" immigration attorney Emily Neumann wrote.","Us ends automatic renewal of employment authorization documents, starting from october 30.

CEO’s AI investment drives workforce reduction strategy

Severance package and support for affected employees





Amazon is preparing to eliminate 800 to 1,000 positions in India as part of a sweeping global restructuring driven by artificial intelligence adoption, The Economic Times reported on Wednesday, marking one of the largest workforce reductions at the e-commerce giant’s Indian operations.The layoffs will span critical functions including finance, human resources, and technology, with employees reporting to Amazon’s global teams facing the steepest cuts, ET reported citing sources. The India job cuts are part of a broader plan to reduce approximately 14,000 corporate roles worldwide, announced by Beth Galetti, Senior Vice President of People Experience and TechnologyWhen contacted about the India-specific layoffs by ET, an Amazon India spokesperson referred to Galetti’s global announcement. In a blog post to employees, Galetti said the cuts aim to reduce bureaucracy, remove organizational layers, and redirect resources toward the company’s “biggest bets.”The restructuring follows CEO Andy Jassy’s June 2025 warning that AI would shrink Amazon’s workforce in coming years. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy wrote to employees, describing agentic AI as transformative technology that “should change the way our work is done.”Amazon has ramped up AI investments significantly, pouring more than $100 billion into the technology this year compared to $83 billion in 2024. While the company plans continued hiring in AI-related functions, it expects overall workforce reductions as automation handles more tasks previously done by humans.The company employs approximately 1.55 million people globally as of June 30, including roughly 350,000 in corporate roles. This marks Amazon’s second major round of layoffs in recent years, following the elimination of 27,000 positions between late 2022 and early 2023.Most affected employees will receive 90 days to seek internal positions, with recruiting teams prioritizing internal candidates. Those unable to secure new roles within Amazon will receive severance packages, outplacement services, and continued health insurance benefits.Despite strong business performance, Galetti emphasized that rapid technological change necessitates leaner organizational structures to maintain competitive speed and innovation in an AI-transformed landscape.","Amazon is preparing to eliminate 800 to 1,000 positions in india as part of a sweeping global restructuring driven by artificial intelligence adoption.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has said that Bill Gates warned him against investing in ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. During an interview with ‘TPBN’ – a tech-focused YouTube show, Nadella recalled that getting investment for the company wasn’t straightforward. Even at Microsoft, you kind of got to have to get a board approval to just go throw a billion dollars out there,” Nadella said, adding “Remember this was a nonprofit, and I think Bill even said, 'Yeah, you're going to burn this billion dollars’”.“But I must say it was not that hard to convince anyone that this is an important area and it's going to be risky,” he continued. To recall, Microsoft invested $1 billion in OpenAI in 2019. Since then it has funded the AI company with over $13 billion.“In retrospect, who would have thought? I didn't put in a billion dollars saying, ‘Oh yeah, this is going to be a hundred bagger,’” he said during the interview. “We kind of had a little bit of high risk tolerance, and we said we want to go and give this a shot,” he reiterated.In a related news, OpenAI has struck a major deal with tech giant Microsoft to restructure itself into a public benefit corporation (PBC), a move that solidifies CEO Sam Altman's authority within the burgeoning AI industry and grants the $500 billion startup significant new latitude to grow.The agreement, announced Tuesday, October 29, untangles key limitations on capital-raising that have constrained OpenAI since its 2019 partnership with Microsoft. That initial deal granted Microsoft broad rights over OpenAI's work in exchange for the massive, costly cloud computing resources needed for its research. However, the unexpected, rapid explosion of the AI assistant ChatGPT three years ago strained those original terms, creating significant tension between the companies.""OpenAI has completed its recapitalization, simplifying its corporate structure,"" said Bret Taylor, board chair of the OpenAI Foundation, in a blog post.

Apple is reportedly planning to roll out the iOS 26.1 update soon. While the official release date is not known yet, online rumours suggest that the upcoming iOS update may be introduced in early November. With the iOS 26.1 update, Apple is expected to bring a host of new features that may include an all-new Liquid Glass toggle, lock screen toggle, sony swipes in Apple Music and more. Here’s what we know about the iOS 26.1 so far – expected release date and features as rumoured online.Apple is yet to announce an iOS 26.1 Release Candidate – considered to be the final beta version before the wider rollout.

Read Tesla Board chairman's 'SOS letter' to shareholders on Elon Musk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/read-tesla-board-chairmans-sos-letter-to-shareholders-on-elon-musk/articleshow/124895403.cms,"Dear Fellow Shareholders,

As you know, Tesla is at a critical inflection point, and we need your vote to help determine the future direction of our evolving company. Your vote matters, and the deadline for voting is 11:59pm ET on November 5th. The fundamental question for shareholders at this year's Annual Meeting is simple:

Do you want to retain Elon as Tesla's CEO and motivate him to drive Tesla to become the leading provider of autonomous solutions and the most valuable company in the world?

Kathleen and I engaged in a rigorous, seven-month Special Committee process resulting in a highly customized performance plan that aligns shareholder value and measurable business outcomes with the interests of our CEO.

Our goal was two-fold: (1) retain and incentivize Elon to capitalize on the unique opportunities that lie ahead for Tesla and (2) do so in a manner that promotes the development of products and services that will propel our world toward a cleaner, safer, and more prosperous future while creating unparalleled value for our shareholders.

We've done this by challenging Elon with the potential to secure what he values most—meaningful voting influence—conditioned on his commitment to continue leading Tesla for at least another 7.5 years while successfully driving our company to ambitious new heights.

The bottom line is simple: Elon is rewarded only if and when he delivers extraordinary performance that benefits all Tesla shareholders.

When negotiating this performance award, we necessarily considered what Tesla's future without Elon would look like, and we did not believe it was the future that our shareholders deserve. At a time when companies—both big and small—are competing to be the first to bring groundbreaking AI technologies to market, we could not risk losing the best leader in the industry to put Tesla on top.

Now is a pivotal moment for our company to emerge as a leader in AI, and with our exceptional CEO at the helm, we are perfectly positioned to seize it.

Though it's no question that Elon has other pursuits, he has proven that one of the many things that make him unique is his ability to stretch his capacity beyond normal limits and remain successful at Tesla. However, if we fail to foster an environment that motivates Elon to achieve great things through an equitable pay-for-performance plan, we run the risk that he gives up his executive position, and Tesla may lose his time, talent and vision, which have been essential to delivering extraordinary shareholder returns.

Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become: a transformative force reimagining the fundamental building blocks of mobility, energy and labor, with products such as FSD and Optimus, and working to better humanity in the process. While there may be nothing wrong with being just another car company, our Board believes that Tesla can be more, that our shareholders deserve more, and that Elon is the right leader to help us achieve our full potential.

Elon's leadership is also built upon the critical support of our ""tailor made"" governance structure, including our carefully constructed Board. Good governance should be customized to the company, not applied with a ""cookie cutter"" approach, and it is exemplified by the results that Tesla has delivered, and this Board has overseen. We therefore ask you to vote ""for"" the three members of the Board—Ira, Kathleen and Joe—who are up for re-election to ensure that the Board, which has worked alongside Elon for years, complementing and enhancing his efforts to deliver extraordinary shareholder returns, remains in place.

That is why your vote is so consequential to the future of our company. A vote here is both an endorsement of Elon's vision and a vote for Tesla's carefully tailored strategy and governance. I urge you to support Proposal One, which ensures the continued leadership and support of our outstanding and experienced directors, as well as Proposals Three and Four, which aim to keep Elon focused on our mission here at Tesla.

I feel strongly—as do the rest of my colleagues on our Board—that Elon singularly possesses the leadership characteristics and technical manufacturing know-how to keep us on the path towards maximizing long-term shareholder value as well as social good.

We at Tesla are laser focused on exceptional performance—not promises—and we structure our awards in line with this principle.

If you care about building a better world for humanity and supporting our vision for Sustainable Abundance—then you should vote ""FOR"" Proposals One, Three and Four.

If you want Tesla to have a shot at becoming the world's most valuable company—then you should vote ""FOR"" Proposals One, Three and Four.

Please read the Special Committee Report, which is attached to this year's proxy statement, for a more detailed explanation of Kathleen's and my work in coming to the essential conclusions embodied in the proxy statement and how we structured this performance plan to align Elon's incentives with delivering extraordinary performance for all of you.

Thank you for your continued support of Tesla.

Very truly yours,

Robyn Denholm Chairperson of the Board





Tesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm has issued an urgent appeal to shareholders ahead of the November 6 annual meeting, warning the company could lose significant value if they reject CEO Elon Musk 's proposed $1 trillion compensation package. In a letter sent earlier this week, Denholm cautioned that without the pay plan, Tesla risks losing Musk's ""time, talent and vision"" as he could step down from his executive position or become less engaged with the company. Denholm confirmed she's had direct conversations with Musk about his potential departure, stating there's a ""high probability"" he would back away if the package isn't approved.The unprecedented compensation package includes 12 tranches of stock options tied to ambitious milestones, culminating in Tesla achieving an $8.5 trillion market capitalization—more than quadruple its current $1.44 trillion valuation. Other targets include delivering 20 million vehicles, deploying 10 million FSD subscriptions, delivering one million robots, and operating one million robotaxis.Major proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended shareholders vote against the package, citing concerns about its excessive size and board independence. Musk dismissed the advisors as ""corporate terrorists"" during Tesla's recent earnings call.Shareholders must cast their votes by 11:59 p.m. ET on November 5, with the meeting scheduled for the following day.Read Tesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm’s letter to shareholders","Tesla is at a critical inflection point, and we need your vote to help determine the future direction of our evolving company.

Nvidia CEO praises Donald Trump





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang came to Washington with a message for the Donald Trump administration. Speaking at he first Nvidia developers' conference, Nvidia CEO cautioned the US government that America cannot win the AI battle if the world, if China fully excludes Nvidia from its vast developer ecosystem. Highlighting Beijing's effective shutdown of Nvidia's operations in the world's second-largest economy, Huang urged US policymakers to reconsider restrictions that could result in Nvidia cede half the planet's AI talent to domestic rivals.""They've made it very clear that they don't want Nvidia to be there right now,"" Huang said at a news conference during the GTC event, revealing that Nvidia has not even applied for U.S. export licenses for its latest chips to China due to the hostile stance from Beijing. ""I hope that will change in the future because I think China is a very important market."" He argued that a policy isolating America from China's developers ""hurts us more"" in the long term, potentially squandering Nvidia's role in powering global AI infrastructure.This is not the first time that Jensen Huang has spoken about the company's falling market share in China.Speaking at a Citadel Securities event in New York earlier this month, Huang revealed that Nvidia is completely barred from selling its high-performance AI chips, including the A100, H100, and H200 models, to Chinese companies since restrictions began in 2022. He said that he has seen Nvidia's dominance in China’s advanced chip market vanish, with its market share dropping from 95% to Zero due to stringent US export controls.Despite the Chinese blockade -- exacerbated by the US export controls that have changed under successive US administrations -- Nvidia reported $500 billion in bookings for advanced chips and announced seven new supercomputers for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The largest, built with Oracle and featuring 100,000 Blackwell chips, will support nuclear weapons maintenance, fusion energy research, and other national priorities.Huang credited Trump's ""America First"" policies with revitalizing U.S. manufacturing, noting Nvidia's chip production in Arizona via TSMC, server assembly in Texas, and networking gear in California. ""Putting the weight of the nation behind pro-energy growth completely changed the game,"" he said, thanking Trump directly.The DOE deals underscore Nvidia's pivot to fortified US ties amid China's rejection. Analyst Blake Anderson of Carson Group estimated one supercomputer, ""Solstice,"" could involve $3–4 billion in Nvidia chips alone, though federal discounts may apply from the standard $30,000–$40,000 per Blackwell unit. Huang balanced praise for President Trump who is touring Asia ahead of a Thursday meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, where Nvidia's chips may feature prominently -- with pleas for market access.Trump initially tightened export bans on China-specific AI chips in his second term but reversed in July. Huang has long contended that barring Nvidia from ~$50 billion in annual Chinese sales hampers U.S. R&D funding, even as Chinese developers reportedly still prefer Nvidia over mandated Huawei alternatives.Beyond government wins, Huang unveiled expansions to offset China losses: A $1 billion investment for 2.9% stake in Nokia, plus the ""Arc"" product line to boost 6G base station efficiency for millions of global sites.","N nvidia ceo jensen huang urged the us government to reconsider restrictions that could result in nvidia cede half the planet's ai talent to domestic rivals.

In a major push to consolidate its presence in the Indian market, OpenAI has announced that it will offer ChatGPT Go free to all users in India starting November 4. For the uninitiated, ChatGPT Go is OpenAI's mid-tier subscription plan for its AI chatbot ChatGPT. The move targets India, which the company identifies as its second-largest and fastest-growing global market. The year-long complimentary access to ChatGPT Go comes as a direct response to similar aggressive user acquisition tactics by rivals Google and Perplexity. Both companies recently waived fees for their premium AI features to appeal to the vast Indian consumer base.OpenAI's decision follows Google's move to make its AI Pro membership, priced at Rs 19,500$, free for students for a year. Similarly, Perplexity partnered with telecom giant Airtel to offer free access to its premium plan, intensifying the battle for AI market share in the country.ChatGPT Go, which initially launched in India in August at an affordable monthly price of Rs 399, was designed as a bridge between the free tier and the more expensive ChatGPT Plus subscription. The free ChatGPT Go tier will provide Indian users with significant benefits, including: Higher message limits; Increased daily image generation and uploads; Longer memory for more personalized and context-aware responses"".Since launching ChatGPT Go in India a few months ago, the adoption and creativity we've seen from users has been inspiring,"" said Nick Turley, Vice President and Head of ChatGPT, in a statement.

Amazon Web Services (AWS) has officially confirmed that its cloud infrastructure is back online after the major outage which disrupted hundreds of websites and apps across the internet. The company stated that the incident was caused by a combination of DNS resolution failures and internal load balancer degradation in its US-EAST-1 region, one of its busiest data centres. “There are no issues with AWS services, and all AWS services are operating normally. We are aware that an operational issue at another infrastructure provider may be impacting some customers' applications and networks,” the company said on its status page.As per AWS’s post-event analysis, the disruption started with elevated error rates in DynamoDB API endpoints, triggered by a DNS issue. This was compounded by a failure in the internal health monitoring system for Network Load Balancers (NLBs), which led to cascading connectivity problems across services like EC2, S3, and Lambda. The outage affected major platforms including Snapchat, Reddit, Slack, Canva, and Amazon.com, with millions of users reporting issues via Downdetector.AWS engineers mitigated the DNS issue by 2:24 AM PDT and gradually restored services throughout the day.AWS stated that all services were fully operational by 6 PM ET on October 29, and the company is now conducting a full review to prevent future incidents. Despite the scale of the disruption, no real-time updates were posted on the AWS Health Dashboard during the outage, drawing criticism from developers and enterprise clients.The outage rippled across industries, affecting:Experts say the incident underscores the fragility of centralized cloud infrastructure and the risks of over-reliance on a single provider.

UAE Emiratisation deadline 2025

Companies with 50 or more employees must ensure that 8% of their skilled workforce are Emirati nationals by the end of 2025.

This requirement is part of a national strategy aiming to reach a 10% Emiratisation rate by the end of 2026.

What is Emiratisation?

Emiratisation fines and MoHRE monitoring

Companies with 50+ staff: Will be required to pay a monthly financial contribution of AED 9,000 for every Emirati not hired to meet the 8% target. This accumulates to AED 108,000 annually per missing employee.

9,000 for every Emirati not hired to meet the 8% target. This accumulates to AED 108,000 annually per missing employee. Companies with 20–49 staff: Those failing to hire the required two Emiratis by the end of 2025 will face a fine of AED 108,000. (This follows a fine of AED 96,000 for missing the 2024 target of hiring one Emirati).

How does Nafis give companies huge financial perks?

Bottom line





With the clock ticking toward December 31, private companies across the UAE are reevaluating recruitment plans, training pipelines, and job structures to align with Emiratisation requirements designed to increase the participation of UAE nationals in the private economy. The Ministry of Human Resources & Emiratisation (MoHRE) has set December 31, 2025 as the firm deadline for private-sector companies to meet their Emiratisation targets. Companies with 50 or more employees are required to increase the number of Emirati nationals in skilled roles by at least 2 percent before the deadline.The Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) has issued a strict reminder to private sector companies across the UAE: the deadline to comply with the latest Emiratisation targets is December 31, 2025. This initiative is a core component of the UAE's Vision 2030, aimed at boosting the employment of citizens in skilled private sector roles. The requirement involves a 2% annual growth in Emirati staff for skilled positions, broken down into a 1% increase every six months.The primary target structure for large companies is:The mandate has also been expanded to include smaller businesses. Companies employing 20 to 49 workers, particularly those in 14 key economic sectors like Finance, Real Estate, and IT, must hire at least two Emirati citizens by the end of 2025.Emiratisation is a national policy in the UAE aimed at increasing meaningful employment of Emirati citizens across public and private sectors. Its key objectives include boosting the number of UAE nationals in private-sector jobs, reducing reliance on expatriate labour while enhancing workforce diversity, and raising Emiratis’ skills, competitiveness and participation through training, incentives and workplace programmes. The policy is enforced through quotas, monitoring mechanisms and sanctions for non-compliance by employers.Companies that fail to meet these specific quotas by the December 31 deadline will face severe financial penalties starting January 1, 2026.Key Penalties for Non-Compliance:MoHRE has stated its commitment to deal ""firmly with any company proven to have committed fraud."" The ministry has enhanced its surveillance mechanisms, including the use of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, to detect avoidance strategies such as ""Fake Emiratisation."" This fraudulent practice, where companies hire Emiratis in non-existent or misleading roles solely to hit quotas, can result in fines ranging from AED 20,000 to AED 100,000 per case, as well as legal action and a downgrade of the company's classification within the ministry's system.The Emiratisation initiative is driven by more than just penalties; it is strongly supported by the Nafis program, which provides crucial financial and logistical incentives. For Emirati citizens, Nafis offers direct support, including salary top-ups of up to AED 7,000 monthly and various training programs designed to encourage their entry into the private sector.The program also rewards compliant companies that exceed the mandated targets, allowing them to join schemes like the Emiratisation Partners Club. These incentives offer significant advantages, such as up to an 80% reduction on ministry service fees and priority in securing government procurement contracts.This dual approach has fueled compliance, resulting in a remarkable milestone: as of mid-2025, the number of Emiratis working in the private sector has surpassed 152,000 across 29,000 companies, showcasing unprecedented national engagement. The Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation urges all firms to actively utilize the Nafis platform to connect with qualified Emiratis and fulfill their national responsibilities before the year-end deadline.The year-end December 31 deadline this year marks a pivotal and defining moment in the UAE’s ongoing drive to integrate more talented Emiratis into the dynamic private workforce. Companies that fully align with the mandated targets will find significant opportunity in government incentives; those that delay risk financial fines, downgraded status, and the growing possibility of strict legal enforcement.",Uae pushes private sector to boost emirati workforce.

Bangladeshi pharmaceutical company Beximco has launched a generic version of a triple combination therapy for a rare genetic disorder. US-based Vertex, which holds the patent for this therapy, charges $325,300 for a year’s treatment while the generic will slash the price by 96% to just $12,775 for adults and about $6,390 for a child per year.Patients of cystic fibrosis, a rare genetic disorder, and their families launched a community-run buyers’ club on Thursday to help patients around the world access the new generic version of the drug.Vertex’s monopoly is estimated to have generated almost $30 billion in profits over ten years just from the sale of the medicine for cystic fibrosis. A 2022 study on production costs of the medicine estimated that it could be produced for $5,700 per patient per year. Beximco is launching the generic version of the triple combination (elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor) listed as an essential medicine by the WHO . It is also launching a generic version of ivacaftor, one of the components, as the treatment consists of two tablets of the triple combination and one tablet of ivacaftor every day for adults.“This is a historic moment. We’ve watched children suffer and die while a treatment sat on the shelf, priced out of reach. Today, that changes. We’ve proven that patient power can change what billion-dollar corporations refuse to. Governments must act fast to take all the necessary steps to make this life saving drug available for every eligible patient,” said Gayle Pledger, who leads the global Right to Breathe campaign, which has been working to make this medicine accessible for cystic fibrosis patients.Cystic fibrosis disrupts mucus production in multiple organs, particularly the lungs and digestive system, leading to debilitating symptoms, such as serious chronic respiratory issues and malnutrition. Delayed diagnosis and lack of treatment contribute to an average life expectancy of less than 20 years.Tanya Takewani, mother of a child in India with cystic fibrosis, pointed out that 14 children died in 2024 waiting for treatment. “This drug has been available for more than six years. How many more children must have died in these years? There are 600 patients of cystic fibrosis identified in India. But only 50 of them get treatment under the Patient Assistance Programme. The development of a generic gives us hope,” said Takewani.Chetali Rao, a scientific researcher with Third World Network (TWN), a nonprofit that has been helping to make medicines accessible, said, “When a medicine costs more than life itself, it stops being an innovation, it becomes an exclusion. Trikafta can transform a life-threatening disease like cystic fibrosis into a manageable condition. It must be available and we were determined to find a way to make it affordable. ”This urgency drove TWN, together with patient groups Just Treatment in the UK and Right to Breathe, to approach Beximco with the proposal to develop an affordable generic alternative.","Bangladeshi pharmaceutical company beximco has launched a generic version of a triple combination therapy for a rare genetic disorder.

The Bermuda Triangle of Talent

Investigating the insecure overachiever





Simon van Teutem is a 27-year-old Dutch author, journalist, and Oxford graduate who has become a prominent voice in the global debate over how and why Gen Z talent ends up in elite corporate jobs that often feel unfulfilling. Instead of accepting lucrative offers from McKinsey and Morgan Stanley after graduation, he chose a different path: investigating the psychological, social and economic forces that steer the smartest students into a narrow set of careers.Van Teutem studied politics and economics at Oxford University, where he saw his peers funnelled into consulting, investment banking and corporate law. What troubled him most was not the prestige of these paths but how inevitable they felt. In interviews, he has said that most students believed they had limitless choices but still selected from the same small handful of firms. After internships at BNP Paribas, Morgan Stanley and McKinsey, he realised that he too had become part of this pattern and decided to step away before it consumed his future ambitions.His book, The Bermuda Triangle of Talent (2025), explores what he calls the gravitational pull of prestige.Drawing on more than 200 interviews with graduates, recruiters and behavioural economists, he argues that young, highly educated professionals are taught to chase status, safety and constant advancement. Many plan to spend only a couple of years in high-pressure roles before switching to something more meaningful but rarely escape. As salaries rise and lifestyles expand, leaving becomes harder, and work that once seemed temporary becomes the entire career.Van Teutem’s key concept is the insecure overachiever, a person conditioned to measure success by continual validation. He says elite firms understand that mindset better than anyone, offering sophisticated but ultimately shallow challenges. He is not anti-corporate. Rather, his work highlights the opportunity cost when some of the world’s brightest minds spend decades producing slide decks or restructuring deals instead of solving public problems.Alongside journalism at the Dutch platform De Correspondent, van Teutem is pursuing a doctorate in politics at Nuffield College, University of Oxford. His early experience inside major financial and consulting firms provides the firsthand insight that underpins his critique. His aim is to reveal the invisible forces behind career choices, not to shame anyone who makes them.","Simon van teutem studied politics and economics at oxford university.

The Bottom Line





When Prime Minister Keir Starmer stood before cameras on 26 September 2025 to unveil Britain’s first national digital ID, he called it a “modern solution for a modern country.”The BritCard, a voluntary digital identity for everyone over 16, was meant to simplify daily bureaucracy — applying for jobs, renting homes, opening bank accounts.Within hours, it had done something else entirely: trigger a nationwide debate about surveillance, data rights and state overreach in a country that famously scrapped its last ID card plan fifteen years ago.The BritCard Digital ID is designed to serve as a single digital credential for identity verification.It builds on the GOV.UK One Login programme and will be free for all citizens and residents with the right to live and work in the UK.Starmer argued the system would reduce paperwork and save up to £85 in private verification fees. But the plan’s link to employment verification — BritCard will be required for all new jobs and housing rentals — has blurred the line between voluntary and mandatory use.Polls now show public support slipping to -14%, with over 1.4 million online engagements dominated by scepticism.The digital ID’s rollout follows Labour’s broader attempt to modernise governance and tighten control over illegal migration.Officials claim BritCard will cut fraud, speed up background checks and create a secure, encrypted system without a centralised database.However, the scheme’s announcement was met with social media backlash.Community notes on X (formerly Twitter) challenged Starmer’s claims on verification costs, while privacy campaigners accused the government of “rebranding the old ID card under a digital label.”The BritCard revives one of Britain’s most divisive policy ideas — national identity verification — in a new digital form.The UK’s last attempt, under Tony Blair in the 2000s, was scrapped in 2010 after concerns about surveillance and cost overruns.Critics say the BritCard risks repeating that history.They warn of function creep, where a voluntary system quietly becomes required for access to essential services, echoing fears around China’s social credit model or India’s Aadhaar before reforms introduced stronger privacy rules.Civil liberty groups like Big Brother Watch warn BritCard could create a “checkpoint society,” allowing the state to track everyday activities.Cybersecurity experts say connecting multiple databases under one digital identity increases the risk of breaches and identity theft.People without smartphones or reliable internet could face new barriers in employment and housing.Opposition MPs, including former minister David Davis, argue that “voluntary today” could become “compulsory tomorrow,” especially once integrated with other services.Downing Street insists BritCard is secure, optional, and citizen-centred.Officials emphasise there will be no single national database and that the system will rely on encrypted credentials stored by users.The government claims the project will “restore trust in identity,” streamline background checks, and support law enforcement in tackling illegal working and benefit fraud.A Home Office spokesperson said the plan will “make life simpler for the law-abiding majority and harder for those exploiting the system.”Public sentiment remains sharply divided.On X, hashtags like #NoToBritCard and #StopDigitalID trended within hours of the launch.Civil rights groups have filed petitions urging Parliament to halt the rollout, warning it would “normalise constant verification.”Polling by Ipsos shows 57% of Britons back ID cards in theory, but only 38% support a purely digital version.Critics argue that the scheme’s success depends less on technology and more on trust, something successive British governments have struggled to maintain after multiple data scandals.The government plans a phased rollout starting with veterans and select public sector workers in 2026, before expanding nationwide.BritCard credentials could eventually integrate with driving licences, NHS records and tax accounts under the planned GOV.UK Wallet.The Home Affairs Committee has opened an inquiry into the proposal’s privacy, cybersecurity and equality implications.Its findings will likely shape how far and how fast the system proceeds.For Starmer, BritCard represents efficiency, innovation and control.For opponents, it symbolises state overreach dressed up as digital progress.The next year will test whether Britain’s digital identity revolution can convince citizens that convenience does not have to come at the cost of freedom.","The britcard, a voluntary digital identity for everyone over 16, was meant to simplify daily bureaucracy.

SkyPath:

Emirates partnered with SkyPath last year to enhance turbulence detection using AI-driven machine learning and real-time crowd-sourced data from thousands of aircraft worldwide. SkyPath analyses Eddy Dissipation Rate (EDR) data — the industry’s universal measure of turbulence, along with Automatic Dependent Surveillance–Broadcast (ADSB) transponder data and its patented iPad accelerometer readings, which convert device motion into turbulence measurements.

This system helps identify ‘clear-air turbulence’ — invisible to traditional radar, ensuring global coverage and industry-leading prediction accuracy.

Through a long-standing collaboration with Lufthansa Systems, Emirates uses the Lido mPilot application — a mobile charting and weather solution offering live convection data, icing forecasts, and turbulence predictions. Data is sourced from partners such as the German Weather Service, with Emirates continuously working with the Lido team to expand coverage and improve model precision for pilot situational awareness.

IATA Turbulence Aware:

Since joining the IATA Turbulence Aware Programme last year, Emirates has both contributed and received real-time turbulence reports from airlines across the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and Australia. This global data exchange feeds into IATA’s turbulence platform, providing a comprehensive, live view of atmospheric conditions.





Commitment to innovation and safety



“We recognise that turbulence remains an ongoing challenge that cannot be completely eliminated, but we’re committed to doing everything possible to minimise unexpected severe turbulence encounters through working with partners who share our vision of using advanced technologies and adopting AI to enhance operations. While we are still in the early stages, we are already seeing validation of the potential benefits these systems can deliver.

While we cannot promise turbulence-free flights, these initiatives have contributed to a significant reduction in unexpected severe turbulence incidents over the past year, helping make journeys safer and more comfortable for our customers.

Our multi-layer approach with weather prediction and technology partners and active participation in the IATA Turbulence Aware programme also enables us to contribute valuable data and insights to the broader aviation industry as we collectively work to address this growing meteorological challenge.”





A data-driven future for flight comfort





Ever since the rise of modern jetliners, turbulence has been the great leveller of air travel, a sudden reminder that no matter how advanced aviation gets, the skies still have a mind of their own. Those pockets of unstable air, born of shifting wind patterns, temperature gradients, or jet streams, can jolt even the smoothest flight into a brief chaos of clinking cups and tensed grips.As turbulence events grow more frequent and severe worldwide, Emirates is responding with a comprehensive, data-driven strategy to make the experience safer and smoother. The airline’s latest initiative marks a shift toward a multi-layered, intelligence-led approach, harnessing real-time global data, predictive analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI), efforts that have already led to a measurable decline in unexpected severe turbulence across its global network over the past year.Emirates’ current turbulence detection and forecasting framework integrates SkyPath, Lido mPilot from Lufthansa Systems, and IATA’s Turbulence Aware programme. Together, these systems form a complementary ecosystem that delivers real-time turbulence information, high-accuracy weather reporting, and predictive analytics powered by AI and machine learning.Together, these technologies integrate into Emirates’ electronic flight bag charting application, allowing pilots to visualise live turbulence zones, anticipate weather variations, and plan safer, more comfortable flight paths.Captain Hassan Alhammadi, Divisional Senior Vice President, Flight Operations at Emirates, said:By combining these advanced systems, Emirates not only enhances its turbulence prediction capabilities but also supports fuel efficiency, operational resilience, and passenger comfort.The airline continues to collaborate with global aviation and technology partners to refine data accuracy and predictive models — reinforcing its position as an industry leader in innovation, safety, and customer wellbeing.","Emirates partnered with skypath last year to enhance turbulence detection using ai-driven machine learning and real-time crowd-sourced data.
