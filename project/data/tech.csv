NEW DELHI: Funding by US Agency for International Development (USAID), which has been under attack from the Trump administration for promoting a ""left, liberal and woke"" agenda abroad, has come under ED's scanner in connection with an ongoing probe against hedge fund operator George Soros.ED, which was probing three Bengaluru-based companies for alleged breach of Foreign Exchange Management Act in receiving Rs 25 crore from Soros Economic Development Fund , has found that one of those, ASAR Social Impact Advisors, also received Rs 8 crore from USAID as foreign inward remittance in 2022-23.The three companies received Soros's funds between 2021 and 2024. Sources said ASAR explained that the USAID funding was reimbursement for the services it provided to a Delhi-based public policy think tank, Council on Energy, Environment and Water (CEEW), which, according to its website, is focused on ""understanding global challenges and implications for India's development"".CEEW has former deputy chairman of Planning Commission Montek Singh Ahluwalia and Suresh Prabhu, who served as a minister in the first Modi govt, as its trustees.ASAR officials were unable to explain the nature of services provided to CEEW and how USAID came into the picture. ASAR and CEEW did not respond to TOI's queries on the ED probe.Sources identified Rootbridge Services Pvt Ltd and Rootbridge Academy Ltd as the other two Bengaluru-based companies that had received funding from SEDF, which is the impact investment arm of Open Society Foundations, one of the several entities founded by Soros.ED is looking for the motive and purpose of these payments made by USAID. Sources said Open Society Foundations was placed under 'prior reference category' by the home ministry in 2016 on account of ""undesirable activities"" - a categorisation which required it to seek prior sanction from the ministry in order to contribute funds to any Indian non-profit organisation.With regard to ASAR and the two other Bengaluru-based entities, ED probe will also look into whether OSF complied with the mandatory requirement. The agency is also probing Soros's funding of Indian civil rights organisations, think tanks and other entities in the garb of foreign direct investments.","Us agency for international development (usaid) has been under attack from the trump administration for promoting a ""left, liberal and woke"" agenda abroad.

Ivy League student's DOGE-style email sparks 'emotional harm' review,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/ivy-league-students-doge-style-email-sparks-emotional-harm-review/articleshow/119890714.cms,"File photo

A student from Brown University , Alex Shieh , is facing accusations from the institution for allegedly causing “emotional harm” after he questioned the roles of the school’s non-faculty employees.In an op-ed published on Pirate Wires , Shieh , according to Fox News, shared that he wanted to understand where the hefty tuition fees—totaling $93,064 per year—were going, especially when the university is also grappling with a budget deficit of $46 million.To dig deeper into this issue, Shieh used AI technology to compile data on the 3,805 non-faculty employees of Brown. He even sent an email to all of them asking a blunt question: ""What do you do all day?"" To present his findings, Shieh created a website called Bloat@Brown, which he compared to an earlier college project by Mark Zuckerberg that ranked students by their attractiveness.The sophomore used publicly accessible data, including information from LinkedIn, the university’s student newspaper, and job boards, to gather information about the non-faculty employees. He fed this data into GPT-4o mini, an AI model, to rank the employees according to their roles. Shieh then categorized the employees into three groups: ""DEI jobs, redundant jobs, and bulls--t jobs.""Shieh's interest in Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) roles was sparked by concerns regarding President Donald Trump ’s executive orders that threatened universities with the loss of federal funding if they maintained DEI policies. Brown University, which boasts an Office of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion, reportedly received over $254 million in federal funding for fiscal year 2024.Shieh suggested that much of this money was being wasted in bureaucracy, pointing out that Brown employs more than double the number of administrators as faculty members, making for one administrator per two undergraduates.In addition to the data he compiled, Shieh reached out directly to the non-faculty employees via email. He chose to send the emails in the middle of the night, worried that the university’s IT department might block his messages. Shieh identified himself as a journalist for the inactive Brown Spectator, a libertarian publication he hoped to relaunch. However, only 20 people responded, with some replies being hostile—one even telling Shieh to ""stick an entire cactus up [his] a--.""Following this email campaign, Brown University allegedly instructed its staff not to respond to Shieh. Soon after, Shieh claims his social security number was leaked, and his email account was flooded with spam and inappropriate content. Within 48 hours, an associate dean allegedly informed Shieh that he was under review for causing ""emotional/psychological harm,"" as well as for ""misrepresentation,"" ""invasion of privacy,"" and ""violation of operational rules.""Shieh, who is now receiving legal support from the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE), said the dean demanded he return all confidential information he had gathered, which Shieh insists was publicly available online. He concluded his op-ed by stating, ""If college administrators are this scared of a sophomore with a laptop, they should be terrified of what’s coming next.""","Student alex shieh used ai technology to compile data on the 3,805 non-faculty employees of brown university.

The first orbital rocket launch from mainland Europe ended in failure Sunday, when the vehicle exploded seconds after lift-off, hampering the continent's aspirations in the commercial space sector.Footage showed the Spectrum rocket, built by German company Isar Aerospace , emitting smoke from its sides before plummeting to Earth with a fiery explosion shortly after departing Norway's Andoya Spaceport in the Arctic region.These rockets are specifically engineered to transport payloads like satellites into or beyond Earth's orbital zone.This attempt marked the first-ever orbital vehicle launch from European soil, excluding Russia, and and Europe's first financed almost exclusively by the private sector.Weather conditions had caused multiple launch delays, and Isar Aerospace had maintained modest expectations. ""Every second we fly is good, because we collect data and experience. Thirty seconds would already be a great success,"" said Daniel Metzler, the company's co-founder and chief executive, prior to the launch, as reported by AFP.""We do not expect to reach orbit with this test.

Auto settlement claims

UPI withdrawals for PF members

The Employees Provident Fund Organisation ( EPFO ) has announced to increase in the auto-settlement of advance claims (ASAC) limit, raising it five times from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh. The move is designed to enhance the 'ease of living' for its 7.5 crore members, sources told news agency ANI.According to sources, Sumita Dawra, Secretary of the Ministry of Labour and Employment, approved the proposal during the 113th meeting of the Executive Committee (EC) of the Central Board of Trustees (CBT) in Srinagar, Jammu and Kashmir, on March 28.“This revision will enhance the ease of living for crores of our members,” Dawra said in a statement. Following this approval, the recommendation will be forwarded for final approval by the CBT. Once approved, EPFO members will be able to withdraw up to Rs 5 lakh through the auto-settlement process.EPFO’s auto-settlement process has seen tremendous growth, processing a record 2.16 crore auto-claims as of March 6, 2025, compared to just 89.52 lakh claims in the previous year. This reflects the increasing efficiency of the system, with 95% of claims now being settled automatically within three days.“The auto-settlement process has greatly simplified claim settlements, significantly reducing the time and human intervention required,” said Ramesh Krishnamurthi, Central Provident Fund Commissioner. “We are committed to making the process more efficient, and with the increasing number of automated claims, our goal is to make accessing PF funds easier for all members.”Additionally, EPFO has expanded the categories for which advance claims can be settled automatically, now covering illness, education, marriage, housing, and more. The system’s improvements have also led to a reduction in the rejection rate of claims, from 50% last year to just 30% this year.In another game-changing development, EPFO will soon allow Provident Fund (PF) withdrawals through Unified Payments Interface (UPI) and ATMs. The Ministry of Labour and Employment has given approval for the plan, and members will be able to access their funds through UPI and ATMs by the end of May or June 2025.“This new system will make it even more convenient for members to access their PF savings instantly through UPI and ATMs,” Dawra said. “It is a groundbreaking move that will set a precedent for other government savings schemes, like the General Provident Fund (GPF) for government employees and the Public Provident Fund (PPF) for bank customers.”","The employees provident fund organisation ( epfo ) has announced to increase in the auto-settlement of advance claims (asac) limit, raising it five times from rs 1 lakh to rs 5 lakh.

Vodafone Idea's shares experienced a significant increase of 19.41%, reaching Rs 8.15 on the BSE on Tuesday, following the government's decision to convert Rs 36,950 crore of the company's spectrum payment dues into equity, thereby improving its financial position and reducing statutory obligations.The government's stake in Vi will increase to 48.99% from 22.6%, whilst the holdings of private promoters Vodafone Plc and Aditya Birla Group will decrease to 16.1% and 9.4% respectively, although they will maintain operational control.Specifically, Vodafone UK's ownership will reduce from 24.4% to 16.1%, whilst ABG's stake will decrease from approximately 14% to 9.4%, according to company sources who spoke to ET.This governmental intervention is regarded as crucial support for the struggling telecommunications operator. This conversion, the second following a similar action in February 2023, will provide essential cash flow assistance to Vi, particularly as it prepares for increased regulatory payments after the moratorium expires in September.Experts note that Vi, currently operating at a loss, needs to settle Rs 29,000 crore in government spectrum and adjusted gross revenue (AGR) dues in the latter half of FY26.
