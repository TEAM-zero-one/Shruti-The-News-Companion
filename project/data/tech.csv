An open letter from Gen Z: Are we really the problem or just the mirror no one wants to look into?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/an-open-letter-from-a-gen-z-are-we-really-the-problem-or-just-the-mirror-no-one-wants-to-look-into/articleshow/125484214.cms,".

We didn’t create the world we’re growing up in







A moment of honesty from the other side

The office gap



Too sensitive? No. Emotional intelligence



Gen Z protests: Dancing, reels, but still historic



All we really want is to be heard



A final thought



To the generations that raised us, taught us, and now often critique us—consider this an open letter. Not a fight, not a manifesto, but a Gen Z’er trying to bridge a widening gap. Because for a group often labeled “chronically online,” “entitled,” or “too sensitive,” it’s ironic how rarely we’re truly heard.We’re told we don’t understand “how the world works.” But we’re living in it too—just on a timeline shaped by decisions made long before we arrived. So here’s a little context from our side.One of the biggest misconceptions about us—call it confusion or plain bias—is that older generations still mistake what they see as a “trend,” an “aesthetic,” or a set of quirks for the entirety of who we are. To many, Gen Z becomes oversized hoodies, matcha cravings, curly hair, performative identities, and Instagram slang. But we are a generation, as real as Millennials, Gen X, or Baby Boomers—the difference is how quickly we’re reduced to stereotype.What’s interesting is how many Gen Zers feel pressured to distance themselves from the label. As Yash Sonkar, a fellow Gen Z, puts it:“We’re into old Bollywood,”“We don’t use that killer grammar,”or “We’re not that online,”as if listening to Kishore Kumar somehow erases the year you were born.The truth is, we’ll hype Travis Scott and Hanumankind and just as easily switch to old classics. That duality is exactly what defines us. But it also raises a bigger question: while we’re open enough to understand and accept others’ choices and identities, is the other side equally willing to understand ours—without prejudice or preconceived notions?Your childhoods may have been slower and clearer. Ours began with constant comparisons, nonstop information, and pressure from day one.The world felt simpler then because it was smaller. Ours is loud, global, fast, and demanding—rarely pausing long enough for us to breathe. Natasha Singh , a millennial colleague, puts it this way, “Gen Z has an over-dependency on ChatGPT. Their constant need to label everything—including themselves—is frustrating for a generation that worked hard to break these labels.”But for us, labels aren’t cages—they’re clarity. They help us articulate identities in a world that often tries to overwrite them. And our use of tools like ChatGPT isn’t dependency; it’s adaptation.Another stereotype is that Gen Z is glued to screens, incapable of real connection. But ours was the first childhood lived online. Social media wasn’t a distraction—it was infrastructure. Community-building simply took a new shape.And here’s the part often ignored: older generations are on their phones just as much. The difference is that we grew up with these tools; you adopted them later. If smartphones existed when you were teens, you’d have been immersed too.Despite assumptions, many Gen Zers crave real-world connection deeply. We’re the ones reviving community gardens, co-working spaces, bookstores, and mutual aid networks. We’re not avoiding connection—we’re redefining it.A senior journalist from Generation X shared something with me that genuinely stayed with me. He said: “My daughter was born in 2004, so what makes me envious of Gen Z is the confidence with which they carry themselves. I see in my daughter many things I wanted to do—dreamed of—but never dared to when I was her age.”He sees in Gen Z a kind of fearlessness—an evolved, headstrong energy that earlier generations often had to suppress in the name of “discipline” or “fitting in.”He then added, almost reluctantly, “What worries me is when they act without thinking of the consequences. It’s good many times, but it can be dangerous on some occasions.”For him, these traits are undeniable strengths—but like all strengths, they can become risky when they aren’t guided by direction or awareness.If there’s one place where the generational rift is loudest, it’s the workplace.Many of us are seen as impatient, but the world we enter is nothing like the one you did. Entry-level salaries don’t match living costs, and traditional hierarchies often feel outdated. When we ask questions, we’re not being disrespectful—we’re trying to understand systems that no longer make sense.What’s ironic is hearing “I hate Gen Z” from people who spend all day copying Gen Z slang and trends—sometimes even Gen Z themselves.At the same time, not everyone sees us through a negative lens. Aashish Saxena, also a millennial, offers a refreshing perspective “Gen Z’s focus on work-life balance and mental health is wrongly , seen as laziness. I’ve found them to be highly efficient—they work smarter, and with the right motivation, are extremely enthusiastic. Their work ethic is simply different from the traditional hustle mindset.”Yet more worrying is how often HR professionals now say they “don’t want to hire Gen Z.” Not because of competence, but because of stereotypes. It sends a damaging message: an entire generation dismissed before they even step in.Some older workers see exhaustion as dedication. We see it as a red flag. We’ve watched generations burn out chasing stability that never came. So yes—we talk about mental health and set boundaries. It’s not rebellion; it’s survival.A recent video of Ananya Pandey went viral when a host claimed Gen Z is “traumatised by everything.” She responded instantly, “No, they’re not. They’re the first generation that’s actually talking about their feelings.”We’re often told we “can’t take criticism,” that we’re fragile or overly emotional. But what some call sensitivity is simply our refusal to swallow pain silently. Many of you grew up in homes where emotional expression was discouraged. We’ve seen how that legacy plays out—intergenerational trauma, unresolved anger, families that love deeply but communicate poorly.Across the world—including in Nepal—Gen Z has led protests demanding change on issues from corruption to climate. Some dismissed these movements as “unserious” because participants danced or made reels, but the impact was undeniable. These protests challenged laws, pushed policies, and sparked conversations that would have otherwise stayed stagnant.We know you’ve lived through things we can’t fully imagine—economic instability, political restrictions, fewer choices. We respect the resilience that shaped you. We admire the strength it took to build the foundation we stand on.But our battles aren’t smaller. They’re just different.We don’t want blind agreement—we want empathetic listening. We want guidance that respects individuality. We want space to evolve without feeling like we’re disappointing you. And we want understanding to flow both ways—not just from age to youth, but from experience to perspective.Older generations often say, “You’ll understand when you’re older.” Maybe we will. But understanding can’t be a one-way street. If age brings wisdom, youth brings perspective—and society needs both.So here we are, extending a hand. Because the truth is, we admire you more than you think. We’re shaped by your stories, your lessons, your resilience. But we also need you to acknowledge ours.","To many, gen z becomes oversized hoodies, matcha cravings, curly hair, performative identities, and instagram slang. But we are a generation, as real as millennials, gen x, or baby boomers. For us, labels aren’t cages—they’re clarity. They help us articulate identities in a world that often tries to overwrite them.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125485016,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-679889,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

""Americans block our funds, they have frozen $9 billion and block our trade routes. Pakistan blocks one side.

If logistics need infrastructure, we will support it. We also invite the private sector to invest with us.""Azizi said the current $1 billion in trade between India and Afghanistan was ""far below potential"" and mentioned that Afghanistan's raw materials, dry fruits, carpets, and minerals offer strong opportunities for Indian buyers while Indian firms export rice, sugar, medicines, and garments.

Why Russell Wilson is the friend who wants all the tea



Ciara, Kelly Rowland & Lala Anthony: Red Flags, Signature Scents & Friendship | Level Up Radio

For Ciara and her circle of close friends, group chats are never dull, especially when Russell Wilson decides to show up in the middle of the discussion. The Giants quarterback often finds himself at the center of their conversations, not because he tries to lead them, but because he cannot resist joining in. On the latest episode of Apple Music’s Level Up Radio, Ciara sat with Kelly Rowland and La La Anthony and the trio let listeners in on what really happens behind the scenes. Their stories painted a lively picture of Wilson, who often slips into the chat with genuine curiosity and a sense of humor that keeps everyone entertained.The women shared lighthearted moments that revealed the quarterback’s playful and thoughtful side. Even as Wilson works through a difficult stretch in his NFL journey, it is clear that his role within Ciara’s trusted circle is as strong as ever. Their conversations showed how he blends fun with honest advice, something all three women value.Kelly Rowland set the tone by declaring, “Russ is nosy,” a comment that caused the group to burst into laughter. La La Anthony quickly backed her up, adding, “He’s all in my business.” According to them, Wilson will not hesitate to jump into a discussion with a direct question that catches everyone off guard. Rowland joked, “He will come in the middle of the conversation and [Ciara] is like, ‘Russ Russ Russ,’ and he just outright asks.Even with all the teasing, their remarks came from a place of affection. Anthony said she values Wilson’s honesty, especially when she needs guidance. “I love his input because sometimes you do need the male perspective. And he’s another one, he will check me,” she said. “He’ll be like, ‘Sis, this is what you’re doing wrong.’”Ciara agreed and explained how the dynamic works for all of them. “We always hold the girls down… Y’all have your own thing with Russ, so my point is if there is something that is love-related, not deep, I’ll be like, ‘Baby, we gotta check on our friends,’” she said. Anthony added that Ciara creates the space for boundaries, saying, “For me, you give me the space to share with him whatever I choose or whatever I don’t choose to share with him. ”Their bond continues even while Wilson navigates the ups and downs of his 14th NFL season. After being benched earlier this year, he remained committed to the team, saying, “I’m not done. I’ve got so much belief in myself and know what I can be capable of.” He followed that with another clear message of loyalty. “I want to be here. I love this organization. I love the guys in the locker room. I’m not giving up on us in this season,” he said.Through uncertainty, one thing stays steady. He is still the guy in the group chat who wants the tea, offers the truth, and brings everyone closer with his presence.Also Read: Brandon Aiyuk’s 49ers future hits shocking crossroads as contract concerns and injury fears spark exit whispers","Ciara reveals russell wilson’s surprising habit of getting ‘nosy’ and digging for gossip around her famous friends.

Jack Flaherty continues to speak up for change while also locking in his future with the Detroit Tigers



Jack Flaherty made a strong and simple statement on Monday when he posted a picture on social media wearing a T-shirt that supported LGBTQ+ rights and called for an end to racism. The Detroit Tigers pitcher shared the photo on his Instagram story, and the shirt had clear messages like “fight racism,” “social justice,” “accountable,” and “LGBTQ+ rights. ” A fan later reposted the picture on X, which helped the post reach even more people and start more talks online.Jack Flaherty has spoken about social issues many times before, and this post showed he has not changed. He has used his voice during important moments in the past, especially when he felt something was unfair. His picture on Monday reminded many fans that he speaks with honesty both on and off the field.Jack Flaherty has always stood up when he felt something was wrong. In June 2022, when a group of Tampa Bay Rays pitchers refused to wear rainbow Pride patches during a game at Tropicana Field in Florida, Jack Flaherty reacted online and called their refusal an “absolute joke.”His comment was made during MLB’s Pride Night weekend and quickly got attention because he spoke bluntly and clearly.Jack Flaherty also stood with the Black Lives Matter movement in 2022 while speaking at Busch Stadium in St.Louis.At the time, he said, “We have this platform, we have this opportunity to speak up, this opportunity to talk and to try to do anything we can to make change.” His message showed he wants players to use their voices for good, not only their baseball skills.Jack Flaherty made baseball news in addition to his social message this week. Selecting his $20 million player option for the 2026 season, he elected to remain with the Detroit Tigers.Before the 2025 season, he agreed to a two-year, $35 million agreement. The contract provided for a $5 million sign-on bonus, a $20 million salary for 2025, and another $20 million salary for 2026 if he made at least 15 starts this year. Having made thirty-one starts in 2025, he met the criteria.With a 4.64 ERA and an 8–15 record, Jack Flaherty ended the season.

Cloud computing shift offers blueprint for Microsoft's AI transformation



Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella fears repeating old mistakes





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella believes the company needs to completely rethink its business model for the artificial intelligence era, turning to an executive who influenced Microsoft's cloud computing transformation 15 years ago to help navigate what he describes as a critical platform shift that could determine the tech giant's survival. Nadella appointed Rolf Harms as an advisor on AI economics, the same executive whose 2010 white paper ""Economics of the Cloud"" helped force a cultural reckoning at Microsoft and paved the way for its cloud success. In an early November memo to top Microsoft executives obtained by Business Insider, Nadella wrote that the company needs to ""rapidly rethink the new economics of AI across the company — just as we once did with the cloud"".""This platform shift is all about building a new AI factory and family of Copilots and agents that drive diffusion and usage across the full stack,"" Nadella wrote in the memo. The move comes as AI companies face mounting questions over whether massive infrastructure investments will pay off. Microsoft took its foot off the AI spending pedal earlier this year, helping to stoke these concerns, though the company has recently doubled down through major new deals with OpenAI and Anthropic.Harms' 2010 white paper was considered a watershed moment in cloud computing, helping make the case for Microsoft's investments by showing why customers would eventually use large-scale cloud services to save money despite concerns about security and availability. At the time, people at Microsoft complained to Harms that he was ""throwing bombshells into their org,"" to which he responded: ""they're already there, I'm just helping you find them"".In a July 2025 letter to employees, Nadella acknowledged the ""uncertainty and seeming incongruence"" of thriving by objective measures while undergoing layoffs, calling it ""the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value"". He emphasized the need to meet changing customer needs by maintaining current business while creating new categories with new business models.The urgency reflects deeper concerns about Microsoft's long-term survival. At a September town hall, Nadella told employees he is ""haunted"" by Digital Equipment Corporation, which once ruled minicomputers but disappeared after making strategic errors. The Verge reported that Nadella warned ""some of the biggest businesses we've built might not be as relevant going forward"".Harms will continue reporting to Cloud + AI boss Scott Guthrie while working closely with Nadella and top executives, advising them on adapting to AI's new economics, from infrastructure to platform technology and applications. In his annual letter, Nadella reframed Microsoft's mission from building a ""software factory"" to becoming an ""intelligence engine"" that empowers everyone to create their own tools.Microsoft declined to comment when asked about the memo.Recently, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella revealed the company is shifting from charging ""per user"" to ""per agent"" as artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly perform autonomous work alongside human employees. Speaking on the ""Dwarkesh Podcast"", Nadella explained that Microsoft's business is transitioning from an end-user tools company to an infrastructure provider supporting AI agents that can complete tasks and make decisions independently. Nadella said: “Our business, which today is an end-user tools business, will become essentially an infrastructure business in support of agents doing work. The way to think about the per-user business is not just per user, it's per agent.”","Microsoft ceo satya nadella appointed rolf harms as an advisor on ai economics.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently outlined what he feels will trigger dramatic revaluation of the electric vehicle marker stock, drawing parallels to chip manufacturer Nvidia’s meteoric rise. Replaying to the question of a user on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Musk gave an answer on Telsa’s meteoric rise. A user on X recently asked the Tesla CEO that when will Tesla experience its own ‘Nvidia moment’. Replying to the user, Musk said that the company’s breakthrough moment will come with unsupervised self-driving at scale and, even more significantly, with the mass production of its Optimus humanoid robot.Elon Musk stressed on the fact that valuation of Tesla will witness a shift once its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology achieves widespread deployment without any human intervention. He also defended Tesla’s relativity modest AI training spend. Musk noted that the company’s vehicles can generate vast amount of real-world driving data which is used to refine the system.Former Tesla AI chief Andrej Karpathy recently praised the FSD system, describing a drive in his HW4 Model X as “basically flawless” and likening it to riding a magnetic levitation train.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly touted Optimus the humanoid robot. Musk believes that Optimus is Tesla’s future growth engine. He feels that Optimus will represent more than 80% of Tesla’s long-term value. Along with this, he also made some sweeping predictions about the potential of Optimus. Musk said that Optimus could:* Help countries like Japan address labor shortages* “Eliminate poverty” and enable universal income* Even serve as an “incredible surgeon”, providing advanced medical care universallyMusk has gone so far as to call Optimus an “infinite money glitch”, underscoring his belief in its transformative economic impact.The comments made by Musk comes at a time when Nvidia surpassed $5 trillion in market value overtaking both Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has projected $500 billion in revenue, calling it unprecedented visibility for a technology company. Nvidia’s success has become a benchmark for investors seeking the next big AI-driven valuation surge.","Tesla ceo elon musk recently outlined what he feels will trigger dramatic revaluation of the electric vehicle marker stock.

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

Record earnings









Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has dismissed the growing concerns about an AI bubble. In recent months, investors and analysts have raised alarms about a potential AI bubble, warning that soaring spending by cloud providers and tech giants may prove unsustainable. Concerns have centered on whether the rapid build-out of AI infrastructure could mirror past boom-and-bust cycles in technology. Huang feels that the industry is presently undergoing some structural transformations and that it will sustain growth for the years to come. Speaking at the company’s earnings call, Huang said, “There’s been a lot of talk about an AI bubble. From our vantage point, we see something very different.” The remarks made by Huang in AI bubble were quite expected as his company is presently at the centre of the artificial intelligence boom. Almost all the major cloud service provider such as Google, Amazon, Oracle are Nvidia’s customers.During the earnings call, Huang also laid down three major transitions which are fueling the demand for Nvidia’s GPUs.- From CPUs to GPUs - Firstly, Huang talked about the slow down of Moore’s law.He said that traditional computing is built around central processors and it is reaching its limit. Industries ranging from data processing to search and ad recommendations are shifting toward GPU-powered systems, which are uniquely suited to handle the massive computational demands of AI.- AI as a creator of new applications - Secondly Huang feels that AI is not just improving the existing tools but it is now unlocking completely new categories of applications. From generative models reshaping search and recommendations to advanced engineering solutions, AI is becoming the foundation for innovations that didn’t exist before.- Rise of Agentic and Physical AI - Lastly, Huang pointed out that the next-generation AI systems are capable of reasoning, planning, and acting and require minimal human intervention. These “agentic” and “physical” AI applications, such as coding assistants and robotics, will require unprecedented levels of computing power, further driving demand for Nvidia’s architecture.Huang believes that Nvidia’s singular architecture supports all three transitions across every industry and modality of AI, making the company uniquely positioned to power this next wave of infrastructure growth.Nvidia reported a record quarter with $57 billion revenue which is up by 62% year-over-year, and forecasted $65 billion for the fourth quarter. The shares of the company rose by 5% in after-hours trading. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress reinforced the bullish outlook, noting, “The clouds are sold out. Our GPU installed base is fully utilized.”",Jensen huang’s talks about transformative shifts driving ai growth.

"Verizon layoffs: America’s largest telecom company to cut 13,000 jobs, what CEO Dan Schulman said in internal memo",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/verizon-layoffs-americas-largest-telecom-company-to-cut-13000-jobs-what-ceo-dan-schulman-said-in-internal-memo/articleshow/125465746.cms,"Verizon layoffs 2025

How this compares to Verizon's previous layoffs









: Verizon has announced it will eliminate more than 13,000 positions in what marks the largest single workforce reduction in the telecom company’s history, a report has said, adding that the job cuts come as the country’s largest wireless carrier struggles with competitive pressures and a shrinking customer base. CEO Dan Schulman, who took the helm in October after serving on Verizon’s board since 2018, cited the need to streamline operations and reduce costs that are limiting the company's ability to invest in customer value.“Our current cost structure limits our ability to invest significantly in our customer value proposition,"" Schulman wrote in an internal memo obtained by news agency Reuters. “We must simplify our operations to address the complexity and friction that slow us down and frustrate our customers”.The telecom giant plans to significantly reduce not only its direct workforce but also outsourced and external labour expenses, the report noted. Additionally, Verizon will convert 179 corporate-owned retail stores into franchised operations and close one location.Meanwhile, a company spokesperson told CNBC that the job cuts are “an opportunity for Verizon to reset, restructure and realign our priorities on ways that will help us regain our leadership as a communications provider.”This represents Verizon's largest-ever single job cut. The company had approximately 1,00,000 US employees at the end of 2024, including around 70,000 non-union workers. Over the previous three years, Verizon had already eliminated nearly 20,000 positions, making the current reduction particularly dramatic.Verizon is establishing a $20 million career transition fund specifically for laid-off workers, focusing on “opportunities and necessary skill sets as we enter the age of AI.” The company emphasised that the job cuts were not driven by AI implementation.Reports say that Verizon is facing competition from established rivals offering cheaper plans and cable operators entering the wireless market. The company added just 44,000 monthly bill-paying wireless subscribers in the third quarter, significantly trailing AT&T and far behind T-Mobile, which led the industry with over 1 million net subscriber additions.Schulman inherited substantial challenges from his predecessor at PayPal, arriving amid aggressive promotions from AT&T and T-Mobile surrounding new iPhone launches. Despite massive investments—including $52 billion for 5G spectrum in 2021, a $20 billion Frontier Communications acquisition, and $6 billion for TracFone Wireless—Verizon continues to lose ground in the competitive landscape.","Verizon announced it will eliminate more than 13,000 positions in what marks the largest single workforce reduction in the telecom company’s history.

Google has officially launched Nano Banana Pro, a major upgrade to its widely popular AI image generator. Powered by the newly introduced Gemini 3 model, this latest version brings enhanced reasoning, improved world knowledge, and more accurate text rendering. The update reflects a significant advancement in Google’s AI ecosystem, building on the success of the earlier Nano Banana tool that became a viral sensation on social media. Users can now generate higher-resolution images, adjust lighting, focus, and camera angles, and integrate real-time information from Google Search. Nano Banana Pro also supports multilingual text and consistent character visualisation, making it ideal for professional creators. The rollout coincides with rapid momentum across Google’s AI products and strong user growth on Gemini-powered platforms.Nano Banana Pro is based on the Gemini 3 Pro architecture, offering stronger reasoning capabilities, improved world knowledge, and more precise text rendering. The announcement of Gemini 3 earlier this week also led to a noticeable increase in Alphabet’s stock, reflecting growing market interest in Google’s expanding AI technologies.Josh Woodward, Vice President at Google Labs and Gemini, shared with CNBC that the new version far surpasses the original Nano Banana release from August. Internal testers have leveraged the tool for tasks such as transforming code snippets and resumes into polished infographics. Woodward added that users are discovering innovative ways to visualise information that previously resisted visual representation.The first Nano Banana tool, built on Gemini 2.5 Flash, became a viral sensation on social media, with users creating hyperrealistic mini figurines. This original version brought millions of new sign-ups to the Gemini app within days, highlighting the public appetite for creative AI tools.One of the standout upgrades in Nano Banana Pro is its enhanced text generation capabilities. The tool can retain original text within images, create new text in diverse styles, and even translate content across multiple languages. These improvements are particularly useful for graphic designers, marketers, and content creators, who can now use AI to produce posters, mockups, and other marketing visuals with highly accurate text.Nano Banana Pro supports image generation at 2K and 4K resolution, a significant increase from the original model’s 1024×1024 output. Users can now adjust camera angles, lighting, depth of field, focus, and colour grading, giving professionals creative control similar to tools like MidJourney. These upgrades make it possible to generate images that meet professional standards for clarity, composition, and artistic effect.A new feature allows Nano Banana Pro to connect with Google Search, enabling images to be generated from live information. For example, users can generate visuals for a recipe, create educational flashcards, or produce graphics based on current data. This integration expands the tool’s versatility beyond static prompts, making it ideal for dynamic content creation.The Pro version can blend up to fourteen objects or use six high-fidelity photos in a single composition. It also maintains consistent appearances for up to five people, which is particularly useful for creating storyboards, presentations, or character sequences. This feature ensures visual continuity across projects, enhancing workflow efficiency for professional creators.Google is rolling out Nano Banana Pro through multiple channels:While Nano Banana Pro produces higher-quality images, Google notes that it is more resource-intensive and slower than the original Nano Banana.To ensure responsible use, Google is expanding SynthID, its AI watermarking system, across Nano Banana Pro. All images generated or edited include invisible identifiers, allowing users to verify whether a visual was created using Google AI.Free and Pro-tier users will also see a visible sparkle watermark on generated images. Ultra subscribers have the option to remove visible watermarks, providing a clean canvas for professional projects.Using Nano Banana Pro is straightforward:Free users are limited in the number of generations before the app switches back to the original Nano Banana model.The original Nano Banana runs on Gemini 2.5 Flash, while Nano Banana Pro is powered by Gemini 3. This gives the Pro version stronger reasoning, better world knowledge, and more accurate text rendering, enabling more complex and precise image generation.Original Nano Banana supports lower resolutions (around 1024×1024), whereas Pro can generate images at 2K and 4K. The Pro version also allows advanced adjustments like lighting, depth of field, focus, color grading, and camera angles, giving creators near-professional control.Pro has enhanced text handling, can retain or generate text in images, and supports multiple languages features limited or absent in the original.Nano Banana Pro can pull real-time information from Google Search to create dynamic visuals, while the original only works with static prompts.Pro can blend up to 14 objects or 6 high-fidelity photos and maintain consistent appearances for up to 5 characters, making it ideal for storyboards or presentations. The original lacks this level of compositional control.Pro includes SynthID AI watermarking for responsible use, visible sparkles for free/pro users, and optional removal for Ultra subscribers. The original had simpler watermarking or none.Pro is available on Gemini App, NotebookLM, Google Workspace, Search AI Mode, Flow, and via Gemini API, while the original was mainly limited to the Gemini App.Google’s Nano Banana Pro represents a major leap in AI image generation, combining the advanced reasoning of Gemini 3 with professional-grade visual tools. From higher-resolution images and multilingual text capabilities to real-time search integration and multi-image blending, the Pro version offers creators unprecedented flexibility. As the tool rolls out globally, it is poised to redefine the way professionals and enthusiasts alike generate and visualise content.","Google has officially launched nano banana pro, a major upgrade to its widely popular ai image generator.

Moody's warns that many US States showing recession signs





Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again issued one of his starkest warnings yet about the global economy. Bezos has urged the consumers and businesses to postpone their large purchases as the fear of recession is mounting. Speaking to CNN’s Chole Melas in an interview, Bezos has cautioned that the coming months could bring prolonged downturn. Bezos has recommend that households should consider putting a hold on purchasing big-ticket products such as cars, televisions and appliances. He urge the consumers to save that money as it will make a lot of difference if the economic worsens. Along with this, Bezos has also advised the small businesses to avoid large capital expenditures or acquisitions during this uncertain period.“Take some risk off the table,” Bezos said. “Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference.”Despite his cautionary advice, Bezos struck an optimistic tone about the long-term future, saying he believes the American Dream remains attainable. He even projected that within his lifetime, space travel could become broadly accessible to the public. Last month, Bezos tweeted a warning to “batten down the hatches,” advice he reiterated in his CNN interview as relevant to both consumers and business owners.Ironically, if the consumers follow Bezos’ advice, then it could mean lower sales for Amazon. Recently, Amazon announced its plans to layoff 14,000 employees. In October, Amazon projected holiday-quarter sales below Wall Street expectations, citing inflation and shifting consumer behavior. Americans are spending more on travel and dining out and less on discretionary goods.Recently, Mark Zandi, chief economist at credit rating agency Moody' warned about recession in the US. A new analysis of state-level data suggests that the US economy is ""on the edge of recession,"" said Mark Zandi of Moody's. ""Based on my assessment of various data, states making up nearly a third of US GDP are either in or at high risk of recession, another third are just holding steady, and the remaining third are growing,"" Zandi wrote on social media.The data reveals a mixed picture across the country. States in the South are generally the strongest, though their growth is beginning to slow. Meanwhile, some of the nation's largest economies, like California and New York, are described as ""holding their own,"" and their stability is seen as critical to preventing a full-blown national recession.However, many states are showing signs of vulnerability. Wyoming, Montana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Kansas, and Massachusetts were all identified as being at high risk of recession. The broader Washington, D.C. area is also notable for its economic struggles, which Zandi attributes to government job cuts.Adding to the forecast, Zandi predicts that the annual inflation rate, currently at 2.7%, could rise to nearly 4% within the next year, further eroding purchasing power for consumers.Along with this, Zandi also warned about the restrictive immigration policies which could hurt the tech sector. He urged the lawmakers to protect access to global talent especially in AI, software engineering, and data science. ""If it feels like we're coming to the end of the tariff increases, or like we're going to get a more rational immigration policy,' I think that would be a signal that the coast may be cleared,"" Zandi told BI.“It’s no mystery why the economy is struggling; blame increasing U.S. tariffs and highly restrictive immigration policy. The tariffs are cutting increasingly deeply into the profits of American companies and the purchasing power of American households. Fewer immigrant workers means a smaller economy,” added Zandi.","Bezos has urged the consumers and businesses to postpone their large purchases as the fear of recession is mounting.

A room full of startup founders and investors at the world's biggest AI conference votes ChatGPT-maker OpenAI among 'likely flops',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/worlds-biggest-ai-conference-votes-sam-altmans-openai-among-likely-flops/articleshow/125364076.cms,"Representative Image

Why AI professionals are thinking that OpenAI may turn out to be a ‘flop’





OpenAI's Master Plan for India

""How can a company with $13 billion in revenues make $1.4 trillion of spend commitments?""

""If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. Enough,”

""Geeze, it sounds more like the judgmental valley conference.""





ChatGPT maker OpenAI was voted among the startups with potential to 'FAIL' in an informal survey at the Cerebral Valley AI Conference. The result offers an unexpected perspective on the ChatGPT maker that has $100-plus valuation. The survey asked founders and investors which AI startup they would be willing to bet against, a question not typically raised so openly in Silicon Valley. AI search startup Perplexity received the most votes, followed by ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Meanwhile, when the audience was asked whether they could invest in any private technology company, most people voted for the Claude maker Anthropic, while OpenAI took second place.According to a Business Insider report, independent journalist Eric Newcomer conducted the survey by gathering responses from more than 300 attendees before panels featuring other major AI companies, such as Anthropic and xAI. This shows that some industry professionals are becoming more cautious about the success of AI startups. Even with a lot of money going into AI, there is now some doubt about how well certain big companies in the field will do.OpenAI taking second place on the list may seem unexpected because it is often viewed as a consumer-focused leader in the AI space. However, its rapidly rising valuation and significant infrastructure costs have raised concerns for some investors. Even though Sam Altman has acknowledged the possibility of an AI bubble, OpenAI CEO rejected the idea that his company’s valuation is overstated during a recent conversation with investor Brad Gerstner.Gerstner asked Altman at the interview.Altman replied.Altman noted that interest in the company remains strong. In fact, both OpenAI and Perplexity were popular choices in another part of the survey that asked which companies respondents would be willing to bet on.Perplexity, which also offers an AI-powered search browser, is aiming to compete with Google, and being ranked first on the list is not unexpected.Perplexity has become a typical example in discussions about the possibility of an AI bubble, as it has raised frequent funding rounds and attracted strong investor interest at valuations reported to range from $14 billion to $50 billion, according to the report.When asked about the Cerebral Valley survey, Perplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer responded in an email:However, it's important to note that any informal, anonymous survey should be viewed cautiously. Yet, the results offer insight into private opinions, as many founders and investors discuss concerns about an AI bubble but rarely mention specific companies.Unlike public markets, private investors do not typically bet against startups, and openly criticising a company without clear justification is generally discouraged in Silicon Valley.","Chatgpt maker openai was voted among the startups with potential to 'fail' in an informal survey at the cerebral valley ai conference.

Australia adds Twitch to the under-16 ban as rules tighten for online safety







Australia is making a big change to protect kids online, and now Twitch is part of that plan. The government has decided that children under 16 will not be allowed to use Twitch anywhere in the country. This rule will start on December 10, 2025, and Twitch will stop new under-16 accounts from that date. Old accounts that belong to under-16 users will also be removed later. Australia already added Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, X, Snapchat, Facebook and Threads to this list earlier, and now Twitch is being added too.The rule comes from a plan first shared by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese in 2024. He said age checks are needed to keep kids safe on the internet. Officials said Twitch works like a social media site because it has live chat and people talk and share things in real time. The government also said platforms that do not follow the rule may face very big fines.Australia says this ban is needed because many kids spend too much time online and may see unsafe things. The government wants stronger age checks so children under 16 cannot make accounts. Authorities said Twitch fits the meaning of a social platform because users talk, chat, stream, and also interact with strangers.This is why Twitch will now follow the same rules as other big apps.Twitch will block new accounts for kids under 16 starting December 10, 2025, and the old accounts of kids will be removed later to meet the rules. Other platforms like Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, X, Snapchat, Threads and Facebook already got the same notice earlier this year.The Australian government said any platform that does not take steps to stop under-16 users may face fines of up to 50 million dollars. This shows how serious the country is about keeping kids safe online.Officials said more platforms may be added soon, as they are still checking how young users interact on different sites. They want companies to take full responsibility and make sure children do not enter unsafe spaces. This rule also makes it clear what counts as a social media site today, even when apps are used for gaming or watching live streams.The ban is part of a bigger plan to make sure all online spaces are safe for children. It also shows that Australia wants strong control over how young users use the internet and how companies protect them.Also Read: Candace Owens Raises Heat While Claiming Erika Kirk Is On Autopilot And Holds No Verifiable Lies After Charlie Kirk Was Killed","Australia adds twitch to the under-16 ban as rules tighten for online safety.

"'Heavy debt, rising costs': UK’s largest pub group to sell around thousand sites; eyes deal worth 1 billion pounds",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/heavy-debt-rising-costs-uks-largest-pub-group-to-sell-around-thousand-sites-eyes-deal-worth-1-billion-pounds/articleshow/125378123.cms,"Stonegate Group, the UK's largest pub operator, is reportedly considering selling approximately 1,000 of its most profitable ""platinum"" pubs for an estimated £1 billion. This move aims to address the company's substantial £3 billion debt burden. The sale of these separately structured sites would not impact the rest of Stonegate's extensive estate.





Stonegate Group, the UK’s largest pub operator and owner of chains including Slug & Lettuce and Be At One, is reportedly considering the sale of around 1,000 sites in a deal potentially worth 1 billion pounds, Independent reported.The move comes as the group seeks to address an estimated 3 billion pounds in accumulated debts.According to Independent, the sites under consideration form a portfolio of the group’s most profitable pubs, often described as its “platinum” collection. These pubs are structured as a separate entity within Stonegate, allowing a sale without affecting the rest of its estate of 4,300 sites. Executives are consulting advisers on options, including selling the pubs in smaller groups rather than in a single transaction.A Stonegate spokesperson told The Sun that no pubs are at risk of closure and all sites will continue to operate under the Stonegate brand. Analysts note that many UK pub chains remain under pressure, with several, such as Oakman Inns & Restaurants, entering administration earlier this year due to elevated costs and reduced revenue.Stonegate’s financial difficulties date back to its 2019 merger with rival company Ei, which left the group heavily indebted just months before the Covid-19 lockdown severely impacted the hospitality sector.Attempts to sell some sites in previous years were unsuccessful, and the group instead refinanced the platinum pubs with a 638 million pounds loan from private equity firm Apollo. The end of a non-call period on this loan in January could allow Stonegate to pursue a potential sale, The Independent reported.Chief executive David McDowall, who joined the company from BrewDog in 2023, had outlined a “transformation plan” to return Stonegate to profitability. Despite these measures, the company posted a 214 million pounds loss in 2024.The wider UK hospitality industry too continues to face challenges from high operating costs, rising energy and food prices, increased national insurance contributions, and the ongoing impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on customer spending.","Stonegate group, the uk's largest pub operator, is reportedly considering the sale of around 1,000 sites in a deal potentially worth 1 billion pounds.
