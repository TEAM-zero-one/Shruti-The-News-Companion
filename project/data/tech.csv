Delhi’s Air Pollution Gets Attention, But Most Indian Cities Are As Bad Or Worse | I Witness

NEW DELHI: Taking, in what it called, an important step towards environmental governance and reducing dependence on foreign certification systems, India has set up the world’s second National Environmental Standard Laboratory here at the CSIR–National Physical Laboratory (NPL) that will develop requisite testing and calibration facilities for air pollution monitoring equipment in the country.Currently, most of the instruments used in India for air pollution monitoring are imported. These imported instruments, however, come with production certification from international agencies based on the environmental conditions of the certificate issuing countries.Since environmental conditions of those countries are very different from the conditions prevalent in India, it affects the quality of measurements by the instrument operating for a long time in Indian conditions, CSIR scientists explained. At present, only the UK has such a laboratory.The National Environmental Standard Laboratory, inaugurated by Union science & technology minister Jitendra Singh on 80th Foundation Day celebrations of CSIR–NPL on Monday, will now not only deal with the anomaly arising out of different environmental conditions but also help in manufacturing of standardised monitoring equipment.Domestic production of such instruments will eventually end India’s dependence on import and make it an exporting nation of such equipment to third world countries.The global market value of air pollution monitoring systems is, currently, estimated at $3,997 million.In addition, Singh also inaugurated the National Primary Standard Facility for Solar Cell Calibration, bringing India among a select group of global leaders in photovoltaic measurement standards. Both these facilities will enhance trust in data and drive investment in pollution monitoring and renewable energy.Describing the National Environmental Standard Laboratory as a “critical step towards strengthening India’s environmental governance framework”, Singh said that reliable, India-specific calibration and certification of air pollution monitoring systems was long overdue and would now enable transparent, traceable, and accurate environmental data.The facility will support regulatory bodies, industries, and startups by ensuring that monitoring instruments are tested under Indian climatic conditions. It will thus improve policy enforcement of various schemes including the National Clean Air Programme (NCAP).Terming the facility for Solar Cell Calibration (Solar Energy Complex) a “future-ready facility”, Singh said it would reduce India’s dependence on foreign certification agencies, save foreign exchange, shorten turnaround time for calibration, and enhance investor confidence in the country’s rapidly expanding solar sector.","India has set up the world’s second national environmental standard laboratory.

Centre imposes norms for AI-based cancer detection,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-imposes-norms-for-ai-based-cancer-detection/articleshow/126383272.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a move aimed at protecting patients as artificial intelligence increasingly enters healthcare, govt has brought AI-based cancer detection and diagnostic software under formal regulatory oversight, treating them on a par with medical devices.According to a notification issued by Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO), software that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to detect or diagnose cancer by analysing X-rays, CT scans and other medical images will now be regulated as Class C medical devices, a category reserved for moderate-to-high risk products.The decision means that such AI tools — already being used in some hospitals and diagnostic centres — will require official approval, safety validation and ongoing monitoring before widespread clinical use. Developers will also have to follow quality standards and report any problems linked to patient safety.Welcoming the move, Dr Pallavi Shukla, associate professor of Preventive Oncology at AIIMS New Delhi, said a clear regulatory framework is essential to ensure ethical use of AI and protect patients. While AI shows promise in cancer screening — particularly for cervical, lung and breast cancers — she noted that most such tools in India remain in the research phase due to limited Indian datasets and are not yet ready for routine clinical application.The regulatory step, she said, is timely and beneficial as it will provide oversight of a rapidly evolving field before wider adoption.Health experts said the move is significant as AI tools increasingly influence decisions on cancer screening and diagnosis. Officials added the step could set a precedent for bringing other AI-based medical devices and software under formal regulatory oversight as their clinical role expands.India has seen a rapid rise in startups offering AI-driven cancer screening solutions, often claiming early detection benefits. Regulators said the framework intends to ensure such claims are scientifically validated and patient safety is not compromised. The risk classification list, CDSCO said, will be reviewed periodically as technology evolves.","Software that uses artificial intelligence to detect or diagnose cancer will now be regulated as class c medical devices.

Dwyane Wade has solidified his status as one of the most financially successful retired athletes in the world, boasting an estimated net worth of $170 million as per Celebrity Net Worth. But some reports claim that the Hall of Famer could be sitting on a fortune of $210 million.The primary source of Wade’s net worth is through his legendary 16-season NBA career, which built a massive financial foundation of roughly $196.3 million as per Spotrac: $157.6 million with Heat and $38.8 million with Bulls.

How fan pressure and MrBeast’s response shifted the spotlight





MrBeast has found himself amidst the controversy of Danielle Marsh’s sudden exit from NewJeans, which was big news in the K-pop world. The 20-year-old idol is now at the center of a legal and public battle with ADOR, the label behind NewJeans. Recently, it was reported that ADOR had ended Marsh’s exclusive contract with the label.Fans were already frustrated by earlier allegations of mistreatment, but Danielle’s departure pushed emotions even higher. In a strange set of events, fans are now clamoring for MrBeast to help in any way he can to help Marsh. Although he was curious and asked how he could help, some are using hashtags and urging MrBeast to buy NewJeans and save Danielle.The whole controversy began in 2024 when NewJeans members claimed their contracts with ADOR were no longer valid. They further accused the company of manipulation and unfair treatment. The situation further intensified in late 2025, when ADOR accused Marsh of breaching her contract by agreeing to unauthorized deals and activities.Shortly after, the company confirmed it would sue former CEO Min Hee-jin for $30 million.Amidst the backlash and concerns from fans, their focus weirdly turned towards MrBeast. Supporters flooded his TikTok and Instagram posts with pleas to help Danielle, with the hashtag “#mrbeastsavenewjeans.”On January 6, 2025, MrBeast acknowledged the pleas and responded to a post from @AniEMPIRE on X. He wrote, “What do I need to do?” Using the hashtag, fans began pushing the idea that MrBeast could somehow “buy NewJeans” or help Danielle regain her place, despite no clear path for such an intervention.X user @karinafan123412 shared a screen recording and wrote, “Tokkis are currently demanding that MrBeast - the most successful and highest-earning YouTuber right now - buy NewJeans and ‘save’ Danielle.” As of now, MrBeast has not offered any concrete involvement beyond his aforementioned comment.Also read: World's most popular YouTuber MrBeast names the best platform to build a strong creator community",Mrbeast has found himself amidst the controversy of danielle marsh’s sudden exit from newjeans.

Vietnam to force YouTube and other platforms to allow skipping ads after 5 seconds starting February 15,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/vietnam-to-force-youtube-and-other-platforms-to-allow-skipping-ads-after-5-seconds-starting-february-15/articleshow/126381685.cms,"Image Via ""X""

New Vietnam law requires skippable ads on YouTube and other platforms

“close”





The government of Vietnam has recently rolled out a new law known as Decree 342/2025 that forces YouTube and other digital platforms to enable users to skip video advertisements after a maximum of five seconds. According to the regulation, the law is expected to come into effect on the 15th of February 2026. The reason behind introducing this law is to protect the rights of users who find advertisements on digital platforms very frustrating due to their length.The new rule will hit video adverts that previously made viewers sit through 15 to 30 seconds without offering a skip option. It will also hit static image ads, pop-ups, and banners, which now need to be immediately closeable with a single click. Platforms will also be obliged to remove deceptive designs that dupe users into clicking adverts, ensuring all skip or close buttons are in clear sight.Under the new law, all digital platforms operating in Vietnam must give users the ability to skip or close ads within five seconds. This includes video ads, animated content, and static banners. Pop-up ads must not use fakebuttons or misleading icons. Users should be able to dismiss any ad quickly and clearly.The decree also requires that online ads include visible icons or instructions to report illegal content or opt out of certain types of ads. Advertising platforms, content providers, and publishers are responsible for removing illegal or harmful ads within 24 hours of a government request. If they fail to comply, Vietnam’s Ministry of Information and Communications can block their content, and authorities can take further legal action. Telecommunication and internet service providers are also required to help restrict access to non-compliant ads.This is perceived as part of the efforts by the Vietnam government to ensure that the country has a much safer and friendlier digital space. These unskippable adverts have been an unpopular trend even on an international level, and this amendment has been expected to bring much-needed improvements.With the implementation of the law on February 15, 2026, YouTube and other online streaming services will have to adapt their current online ad systems to allow for compliance. Users in Vietnam will now enjoy quicker and uninterrupted online browsing as they will not have to suffer through prolonged online commercial adverts.Also Read: Twitch streamer Swifty unbanned after brief suspension, thanks fans for support","New vietnam law requires skippable ads on youtube and other platforms.

Investor concerns beyond Jeff Bezos







Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’, even he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society. Recently, speaking at the Italian Tech Week alongside Exor CEO John Elkann, Bezos said that the excitement around AI has led to unusual investor behaviour, with billions of dollars flowing into companies regardless strong fundamentals.Bezos explained that bubbles are characterised by inflated stock prices and a rush of funding into both good and bad ideas. This makes it difficult for the investor to distinguish.Bezos further outlined the hallmarks of bubbles. He said that the current AI climate as one where “every experiment or idea gets funded,” even if the fundamentals are weak. He pointed to unusual behavior such as small companies with only a handful of employees receiving billions of dollars in investment. This, he said, is a hallmark of industrial bubbles, where excitement drives capital into ventures indiscriminately.Despite this caution, Bezos feels that the technology itself is genuine and transformative. “AI is real, and it is going to change every industry,” he told the audience. He further compared the situation to the biotech bubble of the 1990s, which witnessed many companies fail but ultimately produced some life-saving drugs. Industrial bubbles, he argued, are not necessarily harmful; when the dust settles, society benefits from the inventions that survive.Bezos’ remarks echo a growing chorus of warnings from business leaders. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has previously said the AI market is in a bubble. At the same event in Turin, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon cautioned that investor excitement often overlooks risks, predicting a “reset” or “drawdown” in valuations. Similarly, Karim Moussalem, chief investment officer at Selwood Asset Management, recently said the AI trade is beginning to resemble “one of the great speculative manias of market history. ”","Amazon founder jeff bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’ however, even he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society.

Mark Cuban on biggest barrier for students





American billionaire and Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban said that students these days use artificial intelligence (AI) excessively to ask the “right questions”. However, he said that students should not rely much on AI. Instead, they must use AI to enhance their own critical-thinking skills, rather than replace them. “They use strong inputs and apply critical thinking to evaluate results,” he said adding “AI helps students think bigger, but it doesn’t make decisions”.In an interview with CNBC’s Make It last year, Cuban said that tomorrow’s leaders might be today’s AI-obsessed kids. “Students who use AI will produce better, more creative work and gain a collaborative relationship with technology that’s needed in the future workplace,” he said adding: “Students who use AI will be best equipped to lead.”During the interview, Mark Cuban said that “Access is the biggest barrier” to students being taught how to best use AI tools effectively and ethically at school. According to Samsung’s new Solve for Tomorrow 2025 AI Readiness Study, 80% of US teachers believe that learning AI skills is important for students’ success in the future. However, research shows that educators have expressed concern over misuse of AI tools to cheat, or that the information obtained from AI models will include errors that spread misinformation.But Cuban has asserted that students need to learn to use AI tools properly and productively. He has previously likened the current AI boom to past technological revolutions, particularly the rise of computers and the internet. “Spend as much time as possible familiarizing yourself with the latest AI tools and models, so you can impress future employers with your up-to-date prompt engineering and model customization skills,” an advice that he often gives to students, per a CNBC report.Speaking on an episode of the “TBPN” podcast in 2025, Mark Cuban said”“Every single company needs that.

EXPOSED: Mark Zuckerberg Embarrassed on Hot Mic Admitting Total Confusion During Trump Dinner





Ever since Mark Zuckerberg announced the creation of Meta Superintelligence Labs in first half of 2025, Meta CEO has been on an AI hiring blitz. A Twitter user who goes by the moniker @HinataMotivates, said to be a tech-motivation account, shared a podcast clip (going back to 2022) where Zuckerberg talks about Meta hiring rule and his advice for college students. Mark Zuckerberg has a hiring rule that he says is cardinal for him while hiring anyone and the one that he says is also an important tip for any college student. In an episode of the “Lex Fridman Podcast,” hosted by MIT computer scientist Lex Fridman, Zuckerberg said that most people know Facebook ’s dorm-room origin story and that many have learned the wrong lesson from it. He said that his initial ability to launch Facebook wasn’t because he dropped out of college. According to Zuckerberg, it was due to the personal connections he made while he was still in school.Who you spend time with in college, Zuckerberg said, is “the most important decision” any student can make in college. He advised college students that choosing their social circle is the most pivotal decision, as people tend to emulate those around them. “You become the people you surround yourself with,” he said in the podcast.“I think probably people are too, in general, objective focused, and maybe not focused enough on the connections and the people who they’re basically building relationships [with]. ” Meta CEO Zuckerberg is said to have met his Facebook co-founders ⁠— Eduardo Saverin, Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes and Andrew McCollum ⁠— while the five were students at Harvard University.While the group split up in a not-so-happy manner, Zuckerberg said on the podcast that he tries to prioritize relationships over objectives. This applies especially to hiring. Zuckerberg said that he extends the idea to his Meta hiring philosophy: He only employs candidates he did hypothetically work for, underscoring reciprocity and alignment in professional networks. When evaluating a job candidate, he imagines what it would be like to work for that person. “I will only hire someone to work for me if I can see myself working for them,” he said.Mark Zuckerberg said that the strategy creates a work environment that’s both more cohesive and more productive: If you work with people who share your values on a human level, you’ll be more likely to smoothly achieve your work goals together. It’s all about finding personal compatibility, he said, not unlike “choosing friends or a partner.”","Mark zuckerberg has a hiring rule that he says is cardinal for him while hiring anyone.

""Right after we acquired Blinkit, I asked him (Albinder) to leave. I told him, 'You will not be able to cut it.' He said okay. This happened twice during that timeframe, and we started the transition,""

""All of us have this armour. And when patient coaching runs out, I penetrate this armour. Me being angry is also because I care,""

What is Eternal CEO Deepinder Goyal said about ‘rock bottom phase’



""rock bottom""

""I call this rock bottom, where I hurt people, their self-confidence completely goes for a toss. I do this with people who I think have insane potential, but something in their head is coming in their way,

""

""Over time, the success rate of this is four out of five, where they come out of it,”





Deepinder Goyal, founder and CEO of Zomato 's parent company Eternal, has revealed that he asked Albinder Dhindsa to step down from his role twice shortly after the food delivery service acquired Blinkit. Goyal explained that this move was part of his tough leadership reset method. Speaking on a video podcast with Raj Shamani, Goyal noted that these conversations took place soon after the acquisition of the quick commerce startup, when Dhindsa was struggling to adapt to the changes required after the integration.Goyal said on the podcast.These remarks offer a rare public look at how Goyal handles senior leadership changes at Eternal, which owns both Zomato and Blinkit, especially when founders or top executives need to adapt to a new company structure after an acquisition. Goyal explained his leadership style involves extended periods of coaching, but if no progress is made, he confronts the person directly.he noted.The situation reveals the challenges that can arise when successful startup founders join larger organisations through acquisitions and must adjust their working style to fit the new company's expectations.Describing what he calls aphase, Goyal said he sometimes purposely breaks down a leader's confidence to make them start fresh.he explained.According to Goyal, this method has worked most of the time.he added.However, Goyal did not confirm whether Dhindsa's job or duties officially changed during this time. Still, his comments show how intense the process was of bringing Blinkit into Eternal, especially as the company was growing both Blinkit and Zomato while facing more competition in quick commerce.Zomato bought Blinkit, which was previously known as Grofers, in 2022 for Rs 4,447 crore, or about $568 million at the time, in an all-stock deal. This marked Zomato's official entry into India's rapidly growing quick commerce business. Since buying the company, Blinkit has become a key growth area for Eternal, opening many new stores and handling more and more orders.","Deepinder goyal, founder and ceo of zomato's parent company eternal, has revealed that he asked albinder dhindsa to step down from his role twice shortly after the acquisition of blinkit.

Nvidia’s Alpamayo to debut with Mercedes CLA





At the ongoing Consumer Electronics Show (CES), Nvidia launched Alpamayo – an open source AI model for autonomous vehicles. Announcing the new AI model, CEO Jensen Huang said that it is the world’s first thinking, reasoning autonomous vehicle AI. He further revealed that the Alpamayo is launching on US roads later this year, starting with the Mercedes CLA. “Alpamayo brings reasoning to autonomous vehicles, allowing them to think through rare scenarios, drive safely in complex environments, and explain their driving decisions,” he further added. Responding to one such posts about the autonomous vehicle AI, Tesla CEO Elon Musk wrote:“Well that’s just exactly what Tesla is doing 😂 What they will find is that it’s easy to get to 99% and then super hard to solve the long tail of the distribution.”Alpamayo introduces Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models designed for self-driving systems. The models will allow autonomous vehicles to understand visual inputs, assess driving situations and decide on driving actions. The platform also includes large reasoning models, simulation tools to test rare or unusual driving situations, and open datasets that can be used for training and validation.Talking about Alpamayo, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement that “The ChatGPT moment for physical AI is here – when machines begin to understand, reason, and act in the real world”.“It's trained end-to-end. Literally from camera in to actuation out; It reasons what action it is about to take, the reason by which it came about that action, and the trajectory”, he added.""With a 10-billion-parameter architecture, Alpamayo 1 uses video input to generate trajectories alongside reasoning traces, showing the logic behind each decision. Developers can adapt Alpamayo 1 into smaller runtime models for vehicle development, or use it as a foundation for AV development tools such as reasoning-based evaluators and auto-labeling systems. Alpamayo 1 provides open model weights and open-source inferencing scripts. Future models in the family will feature larger parameter counts, more detailed reasoning capabilities, more input and output flexibility, and options for commercial usage,"" he continued.As mentioned above, Nvidia has partnered with Mercedes to bring its autonomous vehicle AI. Announcing the partnership, the chip maker said “NVIDIA is enabling a new era of AI-defined driving, bringing its NVIDIA DRIVE AV software with enhanced level 2 point-to-point driver assistance capabilities to U.S. roads, expected by end of this year — starting with Mercedes-Benz, a long-standing partner in advancing safe, intelligent mobility. ”“The all-new Mercedes-Benz CLA — the brand’s first vehicle featuring the MB.OS platform — introduces advanced driver-assistance features powered by NVIDIA’s full-stack DRIVE AV software, AI infrastructure and accelerated compute.This design may enable over-the-air updates of future upgrades and new features, including planned enhancements to MB.DRIVE ASSIST PRO, which may be available ex-factory and through the Mercedes-Benz store.”","Nvidia’s alpamayo to debut with mercedes cla later this year.

OpenAI cofounder disagrees with CEO Sam Altman on AGI timeline





Microsoft AI CEO Mustafa Suleyman recently shared what he sees as a key test for the next stage of artificial intelligence (AI). As companies race to build AI agents that can act independently, Suleyman said he is watching for a milestone he calls Artificial Capable Intelligence (ACI) on the path toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). He said that the test is simple in context but difficult in execution – whether an AI agent can legally take $1,00,000 and turn it into $1 million. He described the test as “modern turing test”, suggesting it will show how AI systems can plan, reason, make decisions and operate within real-word rules.“The next big milestone I'm watching for on our way to AGI: Artificial Capable Intelligence (ACI). Can an agent take $100k and legally turn it into $1M? To me that's the modern Turing Test,” Mustafa Suleyman wrote in a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter).Suleyman’s comments come as several technology leaders including OpenAI CEO Sam Altman and Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff bet heavily on AI agents as the next major shift in enterprise software. Companies such as OpenAI, Salesforce, Microsoft and others are promoting agents that can carry out tasks with limited human input, from writing code to managing business workflows.Last year, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff called the rise of AI in the workforce a “digital labor revolution,” estimating that the software company has reached about 93% accuracy with the technology.In an interview with Bloomberg then, he revealed that AI is doing up to 50% of the work at Salesforce.In 2025, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman predicted that AI could soon automate up to 40% of the tasks humans currently perform. He also claimed that AGI could arrive before 2030.Recently, OpenAI cofounder and AI researcher Andrej Karpathy pushed back against the “agentic AI” hype, characterizing the current generation of autonomous AI systems as “slop.” Karpathy has directly challenged the notion that autonomous AI agents are on the cusp of delivering as promised, positioning himself in contrast to the optimistic timelines often suggested by figures like OpenAI CEO Sam Altman.“I feel like the industry is making too big of a jump and is trying to pretend like this is amazing, and it’s not. It’s slop,"" Karpathy said on The Dwarkesh Podcast.“They’re not coming to terms with it, and maybe they’re trying to fundraise or something like that. We’re at this intermediate stage,” he added.","Microsoft ai ceo mustafa suleyman proposes a new test for advanced ai: can an agent legally grow $100,000 into $1 million?

Zack Peter breaks down the wildest Stranger Things theories





The Stranger Things finale may have closed the door on Hawkins, but it has thrown open something else entirely. Fan imagination. In the days after Season 5 dropped on New Year’s Eve, theories exploded across social media, each one more ambitious than the last. Some viewers searched for hidden meaning. Others searched for hidden episodes. The result was a fandom buzzing with speculation and confusion in equal measure.As the noise grew louder, pop culture podcast host and commentator Zack Peter stepped in to sort through the chaos. On his January 6 show, he tackled what he called the three wildest theories circulating online, reacting as both a longtime viewer and a realist. His verdict was blunt. Some ideas were clever. One, in particular, went too far.The theory that grabbed the most attention was the so called Conformity Gate idea. Fans claimed the Season 5 finale was not the real ending and that a secret ninth episode would quietly appear on January 7.According to the theory, much of the season happened under Vecna’s influence, explaining loose ends and tonal shifts. Peter did not buy it.He called the idea “probably the wildest one” and said it was “too deep in the weeds and too meta,” adding that viewers were not meant to be “under Vecna’s spell.”That skepticism matched official word from the creators. The Matt Duffer and Ross Duffer have already denied any hidden episodes, stating plainly that there is no secret finale waiting to drop on Netflix.Peter was more open to another idea. He said he “actually really liked” a theory suggesting Will Byers could be the biological son of Vecna, formerly Henry Creel. He pointed to the lack of detail about Will’s father and Vecna’s repeated fixation on him as reasons fans keep circling back to the idea. While he did not endorse it fully, he admitted he was “not entirely ruling this one out.”Other long running theories, including the idea that the entire show was a Dungeons and Dragons game, were dismissed. For Peter, the finale made one thing clear. Like it or not, this ending is real. The mystery now lives with the fans.Also Read: “Crazy ex-stalker”: Candace Owens accuses The Daily Wire of “toxic” behavior nearly two years after her dismissal","Pop culture commentator zack peter addressed the wildest stranger things theories.

Only geniuses? How adult performers are getting O-1 visas in US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/only-geniuses-how-adult-performers-are-getting-o-1-visas-in-us/articleshow/126375945.cms,"

What the O-1 visa actually requires



How adult performers meet the criteria



Why have approvals increased





The O-1 visa is often described as America’s “genius visa”, reserved for people with extraordinary ability in fields such as science, education, business, athletics and the arts. In recent years, however, the Financial Times reports that immigration lawyers and visa filings reviewed by journalists show a growing number of adult film performers and digital creators, including those on OnlyFans, successfully qualifying for it, challenging popular assumptions about who the visa is meant for.The trend has sparked debate online and within the immigration world. Supporters argue the approvals are legally sound and reflect how modern entertainment works. Critics say they expose loopholes and inconsistencies in how “extraordinary ability” is interpreted.The O-1 is governed by standards set by US Citizenship and Immigration Services. Applicants must demonstrate “extraordinary ability” by sustained national or international acclaim. For artists and entertainers, this does not mean academic genius, but distinction at the very top of their field.USCIS allows applicants to qualify by meeting at least three criteria, or by submitting comparable evidence.These include major awards, high earnings, critical recognition, leading roles in distinguished productions, press coverage and strong expert letters.Importantly, the law does not define which artistic fields are acceptable. Adult entertainment is not excluded.Immigration attorneys say successful applicants usually present their work as digital media professionals or performers, rather than focusing on the explicit nature of the content. The case is built around measurable success.Evidence often includes verified social media followings in the millions, subscription revenue on platforms, appearances in top-ranking productions, industry awards, media interviews and contracts showing earnings far above industry averages. Expert letters from producers, directors and digital media executives are used to argue that the performer occupies a leading position in a competitive global market.Lawyers also point out that adult entertainment today overlaps with mainstream influencer culture, branding and entrepreneurship, making it easier to document reach and commercial impact.Several factors have contributed to the rise in O-1 approvals for adult performers. The creator economy has made income and audience size more transparent, providing concrete metrics that USCIS officers can evaluate. At the same time, traditional work visas such as the H-1B are unavailable to performers, leaving the O-1 as one of the few viable legal options.Another factor is geography. Many adult performers are based outside the US but work with American studios, platforms and marketing agencies. The O-1 allows them to live and work in the US without relying on short-term tourist visas, which carry legal risks.The approvals are legal under current immigration rules, but they remain controversial. Critics argue that the “extraordinary ability” standard was intended for rare, elite achievement, not commercial popularity.","The o-1 visa is often described as america’s ‘genius visa’, reserved for people with extraordinary ability in fields such as science, education, business, athletics and the arts.

Residency procedures and fees remain unchanged in kuwait





What the actual exemption covers





Call for accuracy and official sources









A viral audio clip sparked confusion online, but authorities have now stepped in to set the record straight. Kuwait’s Ministry of Interior says claims of residency fee exemptions under the new residency law are false and unsupported by any official decision.The Ministry of Interior has firmly denied information circulating on social media that suggests residents are exempt from paying residency fees under the new residency law. According to the Ministry, these claims are inaccurate and have no basis in any official announcement or policy change.The clarification came in response to an audio recording that spread widely across online platforms and led many to believe that residency fees had been waived. The Ministry clarified through an X post that no such exemption exists and that the content being shared does not reflect the official position of the government.The Ministry confirmed that residency procedures continue exactly as before. All residency-related fees are still being collected in full and in line with the laws and regulations currently in force. Officials stressed that no decision has been issued to exempt any category of residents from paying residency fees.The Ministry also made it clear that there has been no partial or temporary suspension of these charges. Any suggestion otherwise is incorrect and misleading.The only exemption currently in effect does not relate to residency fees at all. The Ministry explained that an exemption applies solely to health insurance fees, based on a decision issued by the Ministry of Health.This exemption is narrowly defined and applies only to the first three domestic workers sponsored by Kuwaiti families. It does not extend to residency fees or any other charges, and no additional categories or benefits are included under this decision.In its statement, the Ministry of Interior urged the public to act responsibly when sharing information, especially content related to legal or administrative matters. It advised residents to rely exclusively on official and authorized channels for accurate updates and announcements, warning that unverified information can cause unnecessary confusion.The Ministry reiterated that any changes to residency laws or fees would be communicated clearly through official platforms and not through informal or anonymous online content.","Kuwait’s interior ministry confirmed residency fees remain unchanged, denying all social media exemption claims officially.
