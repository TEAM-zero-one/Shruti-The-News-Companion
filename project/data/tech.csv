Government to launch Rs 383 crore national mission to fight zoonotic diseases,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/govt-to-launch-rs-383-crore-national-mission-to-fight-zoonotic-diseases/articleshow/125262629.cms,".

NEW DELHI: With 75% of new human diseases originating in animals, India is stepping up efforts to bridge the gap between human, animal and environmental health. Govt is set to launch 'National One Health Mission', a Rs 383 crore cross-ministerial initiative to build coordinated surveillance, research and response systems to prevent outbreaks like Covid, Nipah, scrub typhus, avian influenza, reports Anuja Jaiswal.Cleared by the Prime Minister's Science, Technology and Innovation Advisory Council (PM-STIAC), the mission will be implemented by Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). It recognises that zoonotic and vector-borne diseases are not just public health threats but also challenges to food security, environment and economic resilience.The first major milestone will be the National One Health Conclave from Nov 20-21 in Delhi, which PM Modi is expected to attend to underline India's commitment to the 'One Health' approach. ""'One Health' is not a theoretical concept but a public health necessity for India,"" said Prof Umesh Kapil, president, Epidemiology Foundation of India. He stressed that collaborative surveillance, evidence-based diagnostics and strong institutional linkages are key to preventing future outbreaks.Officials said the framework also targets antimicrobial resistance (AMR) caused by misuse of antibiotics in humans, animals and agriculture. Coordinated policies involving ICMR, Indian Council of Agricultural Research, National Centre for Disease Control, FSSAI and CPCB will help curb AMR - one of India's gravest long-term health threats - in line with a national action plan.","75% of new human diseases originating in animals.

Matt Hardy on Vince McMahon’s child-focused WWE strategy



Ranking The Hardy Boyz BEST Years in Wrestling

Rising ticket prices and attendance challenges



WWE legend Matt Hardy has recently opened up about former WWE chairman Vince McMahon ’s strategic approach, highlighting how the wrestling icon targeted younger audiences to grow the promotion. Speaking on his podcast, The Extreme Life of Matt Hardy, the former tag team star reflected on WWE’s evolution after the Attitude Era, when the company shifted to a more family-friendly, PG-rated format. Hardy emphasized that McMahon’s decisions were not just about entertainment— they were calculated moves to attract children and, by extension, entire families to live events.Hardy also touched on recent concerns about ticket prices and WWE’s declining attendance. He argued that affordability was a core aspect of McMahon’s philosophy, pointing out that attracting families meant balancing pricing while maintaining a product that remained engaging for all ages. The conversation reveals the ongoing debate around WWE’s business model in the post-McMahon era.Matt Hardy explained that Vince McMahon deliberately aimed to make WWE appealing for younger fans. “I feel like Vince was out there to try and bring families in. That was his whole thing, especially once he changed it after the Attitude Era, when society kind of changed a little bit too. It wasn’t quite as wild west once we started getting into the 2000s and the whole PG era,” Hardy shared.“He was adamant, man. He really wanted to appeal to children because he knows if there are children who get hooked on the product, they’re going to come, and their parents obviously have to come with them. They can’t just let their little kids go to this all by themselves, you know, so the whole family has to cash in and buy tickets. He was adamant about doing that and attracting families, but also he did try and make it as affordable as he possibly could. I think he was cognizant of that fact.”Hardy’s comments underline how WWE’s business model under McMahon relied on cultivating the next generation of fans. By ensuring the product was safe and engaging for children, McMahon not only boosted attendance but created long-term brand loyalty, a strategy that shaped WWE’s programming for decades.Hardy also weighed in on WWE’s current challenges, citing high ticket prices and the absence of marquee stars like John Cena as contributing factors to declining attendance. “If you are going to charge those top-level prices, you have to make sure your product is top-level at all times and is white hot,” Hardy noted.Data from Wrestlenomics supports these concerns, showing that average ticket prices have nearly doubled since WWE’s merger with TKO Group Holdings in 2023. Events like the October 31 SmackDown in Salt Lake City distributed just over 4,200 tickets, compared to nearly 7,900 for a premium event in the same arena two days later.Also Read: ""It rocked me"" – Dwayne Johnson shares candid details on battling depression after divorce with Dany Garcia","Wwe legend matt hardy has opened up about former wwe chairman vince mcmahon ’s strategic approach.

Amrutesh Vallabhaneni, an H-1B visa holder in the US, has brought a lawsuit against his employer, accusing the company of forced labor, labor trafficking and withholding visa documents, Breitbart News reported. Jay Palmer, Vallabhaneni's consultant who prepared the lawsuit, said it is a Squid Game for Indian workers in the US job market, as the ultimate goal is to stay in America, surviving the exploitative culture, created by Indian CEOs. These Indian-origin CEOs import their ""home-country caste discrimination politics"" to their workplaces in the US, Palmer said.According to the report, Vallabhaneni studied in India, got an F-1 student visa and a loan to attend a US college in 2015. Then he got OPT (Optional Practical Training), worked at a New Jersey company and then in 2018 moved to the company that he sued. He moved to the company as they promised him H-1B. The lawsuit said that the company violated laws and asked Vallabhaneni to pay his own salary for a period of six months. They also did not pay Vallabhaneni the prevailing wage.But after all this, Vallabhaneni was not free to leave the company as they allegedly threatened to withdraw his H-1B if he did not comply with their requests.The company also promised a green card but continued to pressure Vallabhaneni to accept their terms and conditions; otherwise he would have to leave the US.""Despite being guaranteed a wage by the DOL, AV (Amrutesh Vallabhaneni) often barely had enough money for rent and living expenses for himself and his family.

NHL Trade Rumors: Could Brayden Schenn and Nazem Kadri be the next veterans on the move?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-could-brayden-schenn-and-nazem-kadri-be-the-next-veterans-on-the-move/articleshow/125254799.cms,"Nazem Kadri (Image Via Twitter)

Are Brayden Schenn and Nazem Kadri the next big names on the NHL trade market ?

2022-23 Highlights: Brayden Schenn

The St. Louis Blues’ captain, Brayden Schenn, has once again become a figure in the rumor mill because of the team’s poor performance at the start of the season. The Blues, who were at the bottom of the league midway through November, are under more and more pressure to change their roster. According to reports, General Manager Doug Armstrong might already be looking at trade options, and this has led insiders to speculate whether the veteran centerman's era in St. Louis is coming to a close.The rumors about Schenn’s fate got stronger after Jeremy Rutherford from The Athletic and the well-known insider Frank Seravalli reported that Armstrong is ""open for business."" The 34-year-old continues to be a highly valuable trade player because of his experience, physicality, and two-way reliability, which are exactly the qualities the contenders would like to have when looking for a calming factor in the center of the ice. Schenn has a contract that runs up to 2027-28 and carries a cap hit of $6.5 million.On the other hand, even though the Flames have clearly stated that they don't see any reason to deal an offensive player who has a very good reputation with the team like Nazem Kadri, the center with the age of 35, his name keeps being mentioned in Calgary. TSN's Darren Dreger gives the information that the team management wants to retain Kadri because he is the main leader and the most determined person to help the team recover during this season.Sportsnet's Adam Vingan and Nick Kypreos have mentioned the Vancouver Canucks, Montreal Canadiens, and Detroit Red Wings as the most likely ones to make a move, while it is widely believed that the Carolina Hurricanes are on Kadri's no-trade list.The situations of Schenn and Kadri, who have been under the microscope, are a reflection of the uncertainty that comes with the aging stars on the teams that are going through tough times. If their teams decide to change and the trade market becomes more active, their names could be associated with one of the biggest midseason shakeups in the NHL.More coverage on NHL",Brayden schenn and nazem kadri could be the next big names on the nhl trade market.

Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason





Gates Foundation recently announced $2.5 billion commitment over the next five years to advance women's health initiatives worldwide. The funding aims to fuel dozens of projects, from life-saving maternal medicines to vaccines targeting infections that hit women hardest. The pledge marks a roughly 33% jump in the foundation's investments in women's and maternal health compared to the prior half-decade. It is the largest funding commitment the Gates Foundation has made in women’s health. The pledge also is a sign of the areas where Bill Gates wants to focus on as he seeks to donate the vast majority of his $114 billion fortune before winding down the foundation over the next 20 years. Gates spoke about the pledge during an event with STAT this week.The vast majority of the funds — as much as 70% — will go to research and development. About a tenth will go to market introduction of new technologies or generating better data around them. Only about 4% will go to manufacturing, and 3% to advocacy. ""It's curious why some of these areas are so under-invested, because the rich world health burden on preeclampsia specifically is still, you know, very high,"" Bill Gates remarked during a briefing, highlighting one of the hypertensive disorders that claim thousands of women's lives annually, even in wealthy nations.The portfolio brims with high-tech promise. Backed by the foundation's dollars will be self-injectable contraceptives for easier access, long-lasting contraceptive patches, lightning-fast diagnostics for STIs, and deep dives into the human microbiome's role in everything from pregnancy complications to broader women's health challenges, including disease transmission.Yet Bill Gates was clear-eyed about the foundation's boundaries. ""One thing we make very clear is we're not able to replace what the U.S. government has canceled,"" he said, nodding to recent federal budget trims in global health programs. Gates told STAT, ""It's just not our role to say, OK, the U.S. government wants to save money and so we'll help them do that.""In fields like malaria, tuberculosis, and non-hormonal birth control, the Gates Foundation already reigns as the world's top funder, Gates noted. Its R&D bets will yield lasting innovations that outlive the organization's support. But for on-the-ground health delivery, the clock is ticking: The foundation's aid is designed to be temporary, hinging on sustainable handoffs to other players.Even with Gates' immense wealth as a backstop, he stressed the need for collective action. A core aim, he and his team emphasised, is to ignite urgency among governments, pharmaceutical giants, and researchers to prioritise women's health disparities—long overlooked despite their outsized toll.""We'd love to have other people work on this stuff,"" Bill Gates said. ""It's crazy that this stuff isn't better funded. Drawing governments and other philanthropists in—we've had some success at that, and I'm putting more time into talking with other philanthropists about how impactful this work is. So I think we'll have a lot of additional partnerships, certainly at the end of the 20 years.""""Then we're gone,"" he added pointedly, ""and so other people will have to step up in these areas.""As the foundation accelerates its sunset strategy, this women's health push underscores a pivotal shift: from lone-wolf giving to catalysing a broader ecosystem. With maternal deaths still claiming a life every two minutes globally, advocates hailed the commitment as a vital spark—one that could, if multiplied, finally bend the arc toward equity.Recently, the Gates Foundation announced a $2.5 billion commitment through 2030 to advance women’s health, marking its largest-ever investment in the field. The funding will support a wide range of initiatives — from developing new medicines to prevent maternal deaths to creating vaccines that target infections disproportionately affecting women.The new pledge represents a roughly one-third increase in the foundation’s funding for women’s and maternal health compared to the past five years. It is also a small illustration of the kinds of commitments that Bill Gates is making as he seeks to donate the vast majority of his $114 billion fortune before winding down the foundatio",Gates foundation recently announced $2.5 billion commitment over the next five years to advance women's health initiatives worldwide.

Siddhant Awasthi’s journey through Tesla: From Model 3 to Cybertruck





Siddhant Awasthi’s impact on Tesla and the Cybertruck









Siddhant Awasthi, Tesla’s head of the Cybertruck programme, has announced his departure after more than eight years with the company. Rising from an intern to a senior leadership role, Awasthi played a key part in shaping several of Tesla’s landmark projects, including the Model 3, the Shanghai Gigafactory, and the groundbreaking Cybertruck. In a LinkedIn post, he reflected on his journey, highlighting the challenges and achievements that defined his career. Known for his technical expertise and leadership skills, Awasthi’s exit marks the end of a significant chapter for Tesla, leaving a lasting legacy on the company’s electric vehicle programmes and demonstrating the impact of innovation, dedication, and collaborative effort in advancing Tesla’s mission and shaping the future of sustainable automotive technology worldwide.Awasthi’s career at Tesla began as an intern immediately following his graduation in 2018. He quickly impressed the leadership with his technical expertise and drive, earning a promotion to engineering manager within two years. This rapid rise continued when he became senior technical programme manager, overseeing the development of the Cybertruck’s 48-volt architecture.By late 2022, as Tesla prepared to start production of the Cybertruck, Awasthi was appointed head of the electric truck programme.He oversaw not only the production ramp-up but also planned future upgrades for Tesla’s high-profile pickup. This trajectory demonstrates both his technical prowess and capacity to lead complex engineering projects at a young age. During his eight-year tenure, Awasthi contributed to multiple core Tesla projects. He was integral to the Model 3 ramp-up, ensuring production efficiency and reliability. He also worked on the Shanghai Gigafactory, helping establish Tesla’s manufacturing footprint in China.His work extended to the development of new electronics and wireless architectures, critical components in Tesla’s advanced electric vehicles. Finally, Awasthi delivered the Cybertruck, Tesla’s most ambitious pickup project to date, known for its futuristic design and advanced technology. His multifaceted contributions showcase a rare blend of engineering skill, programme management, and innovation.In his social media post, Awasthi expressed deep gratitude toward Elon Musk and Tesla’s leadership. He called his colleagues “talented, driven, and truly rockstar,” recognising the collaborative effort required to execute Tesla’s high-intensity projects. He also thanked Tesla’s customers for their support, noting that the company’s vehicles have positively impacted lives by improving safety and delivering tangible value.This acknowledgment underscores Awasthi’s perspective on teamwork and mentorship as essential to career growth, as well as his appreciation for the culture and leadership at Tesla. Despite Awasthi’s leadership, the Cybertruck has faced commercial challenges. Tesla initially aimed to produce 250,000 units annually, yet current sales reportedly remain around 25,000 per year. These figures highlight the complexity and unpredictability of launching a revolutionary vehicle.Nonetheless, Awasthi’s role in guiding the Cybertruck from concept to delivery has been significant. His work on vehicle architecture, production ramp-up, and future upgrades demonstrates a lasting legacy on Tesla’s electric truck programme. Reflecting on his time at Tesla, Awasthi described it as a “thrilling journey,” filled with high-intensity work across multiple programmes. From the Model 3 to the Shanghai Gigafactory and finally the Cybertruck, he emphasised the personal and professional growth he experienced.","Awasthi’s career at tesla began as an intern immediately following his graduation in 2018. He quickly impressed the leadership with his technical expertise and drive, earning a promotion to engineering manager within two years. Awasthi was integral to the model 3 ramp-up, ensuring production efficiency and reliability.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125221991,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-806871,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg took the stage for a candid and humours conversation. The tech titans shared their thoughts on the future on generative AI and the long road to building tech empires. In a lighthearted moment, Huang joked that if he had known how long it would take to succeed, the he might have followed Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s oath and dropped out of college early. “If I had known it was going to take so long to succeed… I would've dropped out of college just like you,” Huang quipped, drawing laughter from the audience and Zuckerberg himself.The discussion involving Huang and Zuckerberg spanned around decades of innovation. The discussion started with Zuckerberg praising Huang’s role in powering the AI revolution. “It’s all you—you kind of made this happen,” Zuckerberg said, referring to Nvidia’s dominance in AI infrastructure.Responding to Zuckerberg, Jensen Huang said, “Why thank you… CEOs, we're delicate flowers,” poking fun at the need for appreciation even at the top.Along with this, the two tech leaders also joked about aging and appearances.“We’re pretty grizzled at this point,” Zuckerberg said. “I think we’re the two longest-standing founders in the industry.” Huang agreed, noting his gray hair while Zuckerberg commented on his curls.Huang founded Nvidia in 1993 with just the investment of $200. He launched the company on his 30th birthday which was later joined by co-founders Chris Malachowsky and Curtis Priem. Nvidia started with a mission to advance 3D graphics. The breakthrough came in 1999 with the invention of the GPU, a technology that transformed computing.Fast forward to October 2025, Nvidia has entered the $5 trillion club. The chip maker managed to reach the market valuation of $5 trillion in just three months after crossing $ 4 trillion. This growth in Nvidia's market value suggest the escalating momentum in AI adoption across industries. Shares of Nvidia rose more than 4%, pushing its market capitalisation. Nvidia ranks ahead of Microsoft ($4 trillion) and Apple ($3.9 trillion), as well as Google parent Alphabet ($3.2 trillion), Amazon ($2.4 trillion) and Meta ($1.8 trillion).Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s journey started from his dorm room in Harvard in 2004, from where he started Facebook . He famously dropped out in 2005 to focus on the company, turning down his father’s offer to invest in a McDonald’s franchise. Today, Meta is valued at $1.6 trillion.","Nvidia ceo jensen huang and meta ceo mark zuckerberg took the stage for a candid and humours conversation.

Scale AI CFO pushes back: “We are alive and well”





Mark Zuckerberg unveils three new Meta AI smart glasses

Business is still booming





Moving ahead without Alexandr Wang





Facebook-parent Meta stunned the Silicon Valley in June this year by announcing a $14.3 billion investment in AI startup — Scale AI. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg made this investment to primarily onboard Scale AI founder Alexandr Wang and other top executives of the company. This move by Meta trigged an immediate speculation about the Scale AI’s viability, with major clients like OpenAI, Google, and Elon Musk’s xAI reportedly pausing work with the startup. The industry insiders also felt that the company had been effectively acquired, leaving its future uncertain. However, after almost five months after the investment made by Meta, Scale AI CFO Dennis Cinelli has pushed back this speculation. Speaking to CNBC in an interview, Cinelli said that ‘We are a company that signed some of the best deals we have had in the history of our company, just in the last two or three months. We are not a Zombie.”Emphasising on the fact that Scale AI has signed some of its best deals in recent months, Cinelli told CNBC, “We’re not a zombie company,”. Along with this, he also dismissed the claims that the investment made by Meta was a licensing or acquihire deal.He emphasised that Scale AI is still an independent and completely operational.Founded in 2016, ScaleAI is known for its data-labelling services and custom AI applications for governments and enterprises. Cinelli told CNBC that both the divisions of the company are growing with revenue “well into the nine figures.” He also revealed that Scale AI recently secured two major contracts with the US Department of Defense which value $99 million and $100 million in August and September, respectively.Scale AI fired about 14% of its workforce in July, soon after Meta made the investment of $14.3 billion, but the company started the process of hiring and has hired 200 new employees. Along with this, the AI company is also working on expansion and is opening new offices in New York, Washington D.C., St. Louis, and London. Despite alls this, the San Francisco still remains the largest hub of the company where it is occupying 180,000 square feet of former Airbnb space.The departure of Alexandr Wang from the company was considered to a major loss. He was the world’s youngest self-made billionaire until October but Cinelli insists the “vast majority” of employees remain. Facebook-parent Meta now owns 49% stake in ScaleAIwhich is valued around $29 billion, but the company has no voting power or product integration. “Scale’s data business has grown every month since the Meta deal, and its applications business has doubled in the second half of 2025 compared with the first half. Scale expects the applications unit to be the primary revenue driver for the company in the future,” Cenelli told CNBC.",Scale ai cfo pushes back: “we are alive and well” facebook-parent meta made a $14.3 billion investment in ai startup scale ai.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman says ‘Slack creates a lot of fake work’; Elon Musk responds: ‘As I was saying …’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sam-altman-says-slack-creates-a-lot-of-fake-work-elon-musk-responds-as-i-was-saying-/articleshow/125213230.cms,"



Tesla CEO Elon Musk has reacted sharply to Sam Altman ’s remarks about office productivity tools like Slack, saying that the ChatGPT-maker OpenAI will “compete directly with Microsoft”. Sam Altman, founder and CEO of OpenAI recently said that while there are many positives about Slack, it also creates a “lot of fake work”. In a now viral clip, Altman about how current workplace tools — such as Slack, Google Docs, email, and PowerPoint — may soon be replaced by a new generation of AI-driven systems.“There are positives about Slack,” Altman said, “but I kind of dread the first hour of the morning or last time before I go to bed, where I’m just dealing with this explosion of Slack. It creates a lot of fake work.”Altman added that he believes a new kind of AI-powered productivity platform is within reach — one where “your AI agent and my AI agent” will handle most communication and tasks, escalating only when necessary.Elon Musk, who has long been critical of OpenAI’s close partnership with Microsoft, responded on X (formerly known as Twitter) with a pointed remark: “As I was saying, OpenAI will compete directly with Microsoft.”In another post on X, Musk wrote: ""At this point, it’s insanely suicidal for Microsoft to continue supporting OpenAI""The exchange comes as AI companies race to redefine workplace productivity. While Microsoft has heavily invested in “Copilot” features across its apps, Altman’s comments suggest OpenAI could be developing its own tools that may compete in the same space.In a recent post shared on X, Altman suggested that the company is planning another major new business venture, putting it in direct competition with cloud technology giants, including Google, Amazon and Microsoft.Sam Altman wrote in the post: “We are also looking at ways to more directly sell compute capacity to other companies (and people); we are pretty sure the world is going to need a lot of 'AI cloud', and we are excited to offer this.”This means OpenAI could soon start selling cloud services, putting it in competition with established providers such as Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and Google Cloud. In September, OpenAI Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Sarah Friar made a similar point, suggesting that cloud providers had been “learning on our dime.” Her comment indicated that OpenAI was looking to safeguard its AI expertise from technology companies that may use its developments to advance their own capabilities.Notably, after the GPT-5 launch earlier in the year, Musk warned Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella about competition posed by OpenAI. “OpenAI is going to eat Microsoft alive,” he said.","Sam altman, founder and ceo of openai recently said that while there are many positives about slack, it also creates a “lot of fake work” elon musk has reacted sharply to altman’s remarks, saying that the chatgpt-maker openai will “compete directly with microsoft”","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125213222,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-28312,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





MUNICH: OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT violated German copyright laws by reproducing lyrics from songs by best-selling musician Herbert Groenemeyer and others, a court ruled on Tuesday, in a closely watched case against the firm over its use of lyrics to train its language models. The regional court found that the company trained its AI on protected content from nine German songs, including Groenemeyer’s hits “Maenner” and “Bochum”. The case was brought by German music rights society GEMA.Presiding judge Elke Schwager ordered OpenAI to pay damages for the use of copyrighted material, without disclosing a figure.OpenAI had argued that its language models did not store or copy specific training data but, rather, reflected what they had learned based on the entire training data set.Since the output would only be generated as a result of user inputs known as prompts, it was not the defendants, but the users who would be liable, OpenAI had argued. However, the court found that both the memorisation in the language models and the reproduction of the song lyrics in the chatbot’s outputs constitute infringements of copyright exploitation right.“We disagree with the ruling and are considering next steps,” a spokesperson for OpenAI said. “The decision is for a limited set of lyrics and does not impact the millions of people who use our technology every day.”REUTERS",Openai's chatbot violated german copyright laws by reproducing lyrics from songs by best-selling musician herbert groenemeyer and others.

Ultracheap and still duty-free

Millions of packages from China

Protecting consumers in the EU

EU authorities are not sitting still

EU countries are not sitting still either





When Chinese fast-fashion online retailer Shein opened its first boutique last week, there were both protests and a crowd of shoppers.The brick-and-mortar shop inside the BHV Marais department store in central Paris hit a nerve and not just because it is in the home of haute couture. It was a love-hate response to the company seen in many other areas.Shein, which is often put in the same category as the Temu online platform that allows manufacturers to sell much more than just fashion directly to consumers, has been criticized for things like counterfeits, aggressive marketing, poor working conditions, and unsafe products. Despite that, many are happy with more shopping options and the cheap prices.Though the two companies are different and have different business models, the result is often the same: a flood of cheap Chinese goods and the packaging to go along with it.Besides simply being ultracheap, another factor that played in the companies' favor is the European Union 's exemption from import duties for packages valued under €150 ($174).The US had a similar loophole for packages valued under $800 (€691), but has changed its regulations leading to a reduction in shipments.The EU is in the final stages of passing a similar rule to close its own low-value loophole, though it may not come into force until 2028.In the first half of 2025, Temu had an average of 115 million monthly active users in the EU and Shein had 145 million, according to their own numbers. For both platforms, this is around 12% more than the previous six months.One of the biggest concerns about these Chinese e-commerce platforms is sustainability. A majority of goods bought on their platforms are sent directly to consumers around the world from manufacturers in China. These individually packed goods are flown in for quick delivery and overwhelm customs authorities and often cannot be returned.Environmental groups are concerned about the clothing waste caused by cheap fast fashion, the plastic and cardboard packaging trash, plus the emissions from all those flights to move the goods around the world. And the numbers are indeed huge.In 2024, around 4.6 billion low-value items were imported into the EU, according to a report published in February by the EU executive Commission. That is twice the number in 2023 and more than triple the number in 2022.Of these 12 million packages a day, 91% are from China. Not all of these packages are from Temu or Shein, but together they have a huge share of the pie.""Europe is inundated by a tsunami of small parcels coming from China, and it's not about to stop,"" Agustin Reyna, director general of the Brussels-based European Consumer Organization (BEUC), told DW.Besides sustainability issues, consumer protection watchdogs and the European Commission have repeatedly warned of unsafe products that don't meet EU standards.New test results published on October 30 by Stiftung Warentest, an independent organization based in Berlin that specializes in product testing, reinforce what many fear.The tests, which were conducted with groups from Belgium and Denmark, showed dramatic results. Together, they looked into necklaces, USB chargers and baby toys.Of the 162 items purchased from manufacturers selling through Temu and Shein, 110 were not up to EU standards, and around a quarter were potentially dangerous. Some of the items had high levels of formaldehyde or heavy metals like cadmium. Some of the USB charges simply got too hot.The European Consumer Organisation thinks flouting safety regulations leads to unfair competition since some companies sell products that do not meet European safety standards, while local companies must follow such rules.In May, the EU Commission notified Shein about practices on its platform that infringe EU consumer law. Among the complaints are fake discounts, pressuring consumers to complete purchases, misleading information about consumers' legal rights, deceptive product labels and misleading sustainability claims.In July, the Commission preliminarily found that Temu is in breach of its obligations under the Digital Services Act by not doing enough to stop the sale of illegal products. Further investigations are ongoing and could lead to a large fine.In October, Germany's antitrust authority, the Cartel Office, initiated proceedings against Temu. They want to see if the platform is possibly influencing the pricing on its German online marketplace, including setting the final selling prices.In August, Shein was fined €1 million by Italy's competition authority for using misleading environmental claims.In July, Shein was fined €40 million by France's competition agency for misleading discounts and environmental claims. That brings total French fines for the company this year to €191 million.France has gone a step further and is working on new regulations for fast-fashion companies like Temu and Shein. If approved, it would ban their ads in France, force them to report on the environmental effects of their goods and add a levy of up to €10 for each garment bought.Big fines and more regulations may slow Chinese e-commerce giants but will not stop them.""Europe needs to get its act together and make Temu and Shein accountable,"" said Agustin Reyna. ""We need clear responsibilities and deterrent consequences when the products they sell break our rules.""To make this happen, the EU needs ambitious customs reform and market surveillance. But if the EU allows packages valued under €150 to come in duty-free until 2028, companies will continue to take advantage of the loophole and European customers will likely keep shopping.","In 2024, around 4.6 billion low-value items were imported into the eu.

A Redditor made a controversial post about his experience of coming back to India after 7 years.





A Redditor's post went viral after the man questioned his decision to come back to India after staying seven years in one of the happiest European countries. The man spoke about pollution, traffic, civic sense of people and also complained about India's fruits and milk. Summing up his experience in India, the Redditor said everything is messed up here.""Returned to india after 7 years from one of the happiest European country. Main reason was, I am a single child so wanted to stay with parents when they are aging. It's been 6 months now but we (me and my wife) are not able to adjust here. We try to find positive things but honestly it's so difficult. Never wanted fancy things in life but simple things like peaceful walk, taking kids to open public spaces nearby , spending time in nature without going far are not possible. Air is polluted, food is not good ( fruits and milk specially ), traffic and roads are so bad. Biggest concern is civic sense. It is so bad that my kid keep asking me so many questions.His life was much better there and I feel I did injustice to him. Approaching 40 in few years and after coming back realized that surviving here professionally with this much experience is very difficult for my skillset. Seems everything is messed up in india,"" the man wrote.As the Redditor did not mention the state in India, social media users pointed out that it's unrealistic to expect that everything in India would change only in seven years. ""You should not have come back. And if you can, go back now. India will become only worse from here,"" one wrote.Some agreed with the Redditor's point of view and opined that India was much different and better when these people left India. ""People have that picture of India and all of a sudden that picture is broken once they are back to this new India,"" one wrote.""What is the purpose of your post? If you can move back to your foreign country please do. Otherwise, what are you even asking here. Or are trying to imply that those who are returning to their home to be with parents or for whatever reasons should not return because YOU do not like it in India. What a way of imposing your personal limited world view on other Indians!"" one wrote. Some pointed out that the person has been ranting against India on Reddit in various posts, not seeking any genuine advice.","A redditor made a controversial post about his experience of coming back to india after 7 years.
