"On May 29, group captain Shubhanshu Shukla will be first Indian astronaut to fly to ISS",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/on-may-29-group-captain-shubhanshu-shukla-will-be-first-indian-astronaut-to-fly-to-iss/articleshow/120742705.cms,"(Drop cap) India’s dream of sending its first astronaut to the world’s biggest space station will soon be realised as IAF Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla will fly to the International Space Station on May 29 at 1.03 pm Eastern Time Zone (10.33pm IST), Axiom Space announced on Tuesday.According to Nasa, Group Capt Shukla, who was trained for the space mission in Russia as well as in the US, will pilot Axiom Mission-4 , a private astronaut mission launching aboard a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft. The mission, which is jointly being undertaken by Nasa and Isro, will be launched from the Kennedy Space Centre in Florida.Group Capt Shukla will be accompanied by Peggy Whitson, a former Nasa astronaut, mission commander Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski from Poland and Tibor Kapu from Hungary. Once docked, the astronauts are scheduled to spend up to 14 days aboard the orbiting laboratory, conducting a mission comprising science, outreach and commercial activities. Shukla's trip to space comes four decades after Rakesh Sharma’s iconic spaceflight onboard Russia's Soyuz spacecraft in April 1984.“Private astronaut missions are an important component of Nasa’s strategy for enabling a robust and competitive commercial economy in low Earth orbit. Private astronaut missions also serve as pathfinders in demonstrating the demand for future commercial space stations,” the US space agency said on X while confirming the launch date.Isro has shortlisted seven microgravity research experiments proposed by Indian principal investigators from various national R&D labs or academic institutions for implementation on the ISS by the Indian astronaut. These include studying 'water bears' — microscopic organisations — to understand how living things adapt to microgravity. According to Isro, the experience will nurture a microgravity research ecosystem back home, leading to the induction of advanced experiments that make up India's space programme.Space minister Jitendra Singh said Shukla will focus on 'space technology, space bio-manufacturing, and bio-astronautics' during his ISS mission.“We have a sprouting experiment which tries to sprout green gram or moong and methi or fenugreek seeds, which are believed to have medicinal properties,” Tushar Phadnis, group head for microgravity platforms and research, said at the virtual press conference organised by Axiom. “The idea is not just to stop sprouting it there. The idea is also to see how these India-specific sprouts behave when they come back. They will undergo a lot of analysis in the labs of the respective PIs (principal investigators),” Phadnis said.Overall, Axiom-4 has a research complement of around 60 scientific studies, including the seven from India. Lucie Low, chief scientist, Axiom Space, reiterated that this will be the most research and science-related activities conducted on an Axiom Space mission aboard the ISS to date.Experience from the ISS mission will give momentum to India’s first human spaceflight programme ‘Gaganyaan’ and also future manned missions to space.Director of international govt business at Axiom Space, Pearly Pandya, who is an Indian-American and was born in Ahmedabad, informed the media in Delhi recently that Shukla and his backup, Group Captain Prashanth Nair, are being trained to operate payloads and conduct scientific research in microgravity. The ISS project is an end-to-end commercial mission for Axiom, which will take care of astronaut training, medical operations and help conduct space experiments, she added.The Ax-4 mission is a significant collaboration between India and the US, announced by PM Narendra Modi during his visit to the US last year.","Iaf group captain shubhanshu shukla will fly to the international space station on may 29.

Shaquille O’Neal has fallen out of love with the Tesla Cybertruck

“It Was A Sad Day For Me” Shaq Reflects On WWE Being Fake + Karlous Calls Out Stephen A & Tom Brady

Former NBA star turned sports analyst Shaquille O’Neal once showed off his custom Tesla Cybertruck on Instagram. He has now fallen out of love with the car and has revealed selling off two of them for not getting the desired mileage. Instead, he has now purchased a Cadillac Escalade IQ , which he says gives him much better output with the same amount of energy than the Cybertruck. The NBA player is very fond of cars and referred to them as “girlfriends” while talking about them.Shaquille O’Neal was on The Big Podcast where a comedian sarcastically praised him for always getting cars customized from every car shop in America. Not only this, he also mentioned how the generous Shaq once gifted a van to a family with many kids.Talking about why he got rid of his Cybertrucks, Shaq said, “I was into Cybertrucks but they don’t give enough charge mileage. Then I just got one of those IQs system Escalades. Today I was in Vegas, I ain’t have to charge up for four days. My Cybertruck here, if I go downtown to work tonight and come back, I’m gonna be struggling to get back. Right now it says 267. If I go to Atlanta to the thing and come back, when I come back it ain’t going to be…”The Cadillac Escalade IQ has a much better mileage on a single charge than the Tesla Cybertruck. While the Cybertruck can give around 510 km per charge, the Cadillac Escalade can give 745 km per charge, reportedly.When another guest mentioned how Shaq always brings the most expensive cars to work when he goes to the set of Inside The NBA, Shaq joked, “I treat them like girlfriends, my police car girlfriend I haven’t seen in a while so I will probably take her on a date tonight. But I am leaving tomorrow for another week so I will probably take my favorite girlfriend out tonight.”Also Read: Gilbert Arenas' son Alijah Arenas hospitalized following Tesla Cybertruck crash, graphic footage surfaces Recently, former NBA player Gilbert Arenas' son Alijah Arenas had a serious accident when his Tesla Cybertruck crashed into a tree near his home.

VTuber Sinder controversy explained: Allegations and Full Timeline,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/news/vtuber-sinder-controversy-explained-allegations-and-full-timeline/articleshow/120691648.cms,"Image via Sinder

Nanoless accuses Sinder and REDACTED about slandering other creators, exclusivity & blacklisting other creators



“I will start with screenshots showing them speaking ill of other creators & spreading rumors while manipulating me that it’s all in our best interest. In addition to spreading ill rumors they also complain and accuse

Bao

of giving “their” editor too much work, resulting in the editor not having any time for new clients which will be important later on. The screenshots below show them showing their affection & appreciation immediately followed by spreading rumors & lies to make other clients appear problematic to manipulate any future decisions regarding commissions.”

""They mentioned wanting an exclusivity contract, but they didn’t want to pay for exclusivity, but rather when a creator from their blacklist comes asking for a commission, they would guarantee me model work for Sinder only and if anyone asked me for commissions, they’d commission me instead to compensate for not working with other creators. This felt very strange given that one of the accusations they made was overworking their editor yet their “solution” to me working with other creators was for them to essentially overwork me to keep me from working on other projects.""

“The messages below show that their primary concern is that the more non Sinder models I make, the less “valuable” my existing models become. It’s hard to say how much this messed with my mind as an artist that by working with other people I’m somehow making my existing models less special.”

Vampeaches reveals that REDACTED is Sinder’s boyfriend



""I remember playing Phasmophobia with you and hearing RED chat away next to you before you first debuted like 4 years ago. You told me he was your boyfriend. Then before we met for Twitchcon you switched up and said 'just so you know my manager is coming with me on this trip' as if I didn't know who he was. It's even ickier to read this tweet knowing he is your significant other and that you're probably going to try and avoid taking responsibility for hurting people who trusted you as friends by nuking the RED side of this duo.""

Sinder’s official apology



“Redacted has been my co-content creator since I began making content, managing all aspects of what I do, and being a major part of why I’m here. We have also been in a relationship since the start of my endeavors. It’s no secret that many vtubers choose to keep their public and personal lives separate, and I’m no different. As of yesterday he is no longer working with me, and I have not extensively discussed any of this with him. Where our personal situation goes from here will be figured out between us privately. I never intended to mention us publicly, but given that the claims are out there, I want everyone to know I’m taking this seriously. After years of working on everything together, his hyper business oriented outlook warped my view of what it is I should be doing, and what should be important to me as I navigate this career path. I have a terrible work life balance as it is, and being around projects and streams all day every day made me lose sight of the point. It took all of this happening for me to realize this behavior isn’t normal or healthy, and it’s not an outlook I want to have. This doesn’t absolve me of the things I’ve willingly done wrong and went along with, or the way I’ve treated people who were fully undeserving.”

“In regards to Nanoless, for the majority of the time working with her, Red was the one almost solely doing the communication about new plans and negotiations through his private DMs. Nano had a project server we were all a part of where the actual art and models were worked on, but the conversations were focused around the work itself. I was not fully aware of the extent of Red’s manipulation over Nano’s commission decisions, and I should’ve been more diligent in my oversight.”

The popular Twitch VTuber Sinder has come under negative limelight following accusations from the Vtuber artist Nanoless, who issued a Google document about the termination of work. Within the same, Nanoless accused Sinder and her manager REDCATED about “manipulating, using, and dragging them into drama, while sabotaging, slandering & spreading lies about people they thought were the VTuber’s closest friends.The document was posted on Nanoless’ X handle on April 26, 2025, and the controversy has spread like wildfire since then. Here we take a detailed look at all the accusations aimed at VTuber Sinder and REDCATED.Nanoless’ document consists of several allegations, the first one being about Sinder and REDACTED slandering other creators. As part of the same, the VTuber artist shared several Discord screenshots with that of REDACTED. Nanoless claimed that the two spoke ill and spread rumors about other streamers.Nanoless exactly stated:Added to this, Nanoless’ document also mentions about REDACTED speaking ill about Vtubers like Shylily, who is another popular name.Coming to the exclusivity, Sinder and REDACTED essentially wanted to issue an exclusivity contract but didn’t want to pay about the same. Nanoless additionally mentioned that they would compensate for not working with content creators that they had blacklisted. The document mentions:She also added:The screenshots related to the same are on the document itself. You can find the same by heading over to Nanoless’ X account (@Nanoless_)Following the official post by Nanoless, Sinder announced that REDACTED will no longer manager her VTuber activities, and completely cut ties with her manager. Vampeaches responded to this post by revealing that REDACTED is Sinder’s boyfriend. She mentioned the following:Finally, Sinder posted a document titled “My Apology” on April 28, 2025. The same officially confirmed REDACTED as her partner, and the duo were together since she began her journey as VTuber.

Shannon Sharpe Lawsuit: Who is Gabriella Zuniga? The OnlyFans star who sued Shannon Sharpe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/who-is-gabriella-zuniga-the-onlyfans-star-who-sued-shannon-sharpe/articleshow/120578272.cms,"Source - X

Gabriella Zuniga: The woman rumored to be behind the Shannon Sharpe lawsuit



Who is Gabriella Zuniga? A young model with a quiet online past until now

For weeks, the $50 million civil lawsuit against Shannon Sharpe featured a mystery woman simply referred to as “Jane Doe.” But now, internet detectives and a few hip-hop gossip outlets believe they’ve uncovered who she is. Enter Gabbi Zuniga , a 20-year-old OnlyFans model whose name is suddenly at the center of one of the most talked-about legal cases in sports media, sparking debates, speculation, and a flurry of theories across every corner of the internet.Here’s everything we know so far about Zuniga, where this information is coming from, and why the internet believes she’s the woman behind the allegations.The name Gabbi Zuniga first started trending on Twitter and TikTok shortly after news of the Shannon Sharpe lawsuit broke. According to viral posts from hip-hop accounts like WorldStarHipHop , OnSite, and The Neighborhood Talk, Zuniga is being identified as the woman suing Sharpe for rape, emotional abuse, and secretly recording intimate moments.Here’s why the internet believes Gabbi Zuniga is the woman suing Shannon Sharpe: The lawsuit never names the accuser, identifying her only as “Jane Doe,” but social media detectives quickly connected the dots. Screenshots of flirty DMs allegedly linked to Gabbi’s accounts began circulating, and old OnlyFans clips, TikToks, and deleted Instagram posts reportedly showed her in spaces resembling Sharpe’s home or hotel rooms described in the suit.Though the court documents still list the accuser as “Jane Doe”, these online receipts have pushed Gabbi’s name into the spotlight. No one has confirmed this yet, but screenshots of Gabbi’s alleged texts and DMs with Sharpe are circulating online and multiple Reddit and X (formerly Twitter) threads claim she was spotted with Sharpe in LA..Before this legal case, Gabbi Zuniga wasn’t a household name. She reportedly ran a modest OnlyFans account, occasionally posted on TikTok, and goes by the name of @sheiskarli on Instagram. Users claim she previously worked in LA as a fitness model and met Sharpe at a West Hollywood gym in 2023 when she was 20. Her online presence was relatively low-key, but since the lawsuit went public, internet detectives have been digging into her digital footprint, resurfacing old posts, photos, and speculation about her connection to Sharpe well before the legal action began.In civil lawsuits like this especially involving sexual assault—plaintiffs often use the name “Jane Doe” to protect their identity. It’s legal and standard practice. But once the story hits the internet, things can spiral.Now, her name is trending across social media, with hundreds of users analyzing her posts and reposting alleged clips of her and Sharpe together.Gabbi hasn’t publicly confirmed or denied her involvement in the case, and her social media pages are now locked or deleted. Still, the viral naming has led to real-life implications, with online trolls, fans, and media digging into her private life.Sharpe’s legal team, meanwhile, is still treating the case as involving “Jane Doe,” and neither side has commented directly on Gabbi Zuniga by name. They’re keeping things very tight-lipped, likely to avoid adding more fuel to the already raging fire and giving the media even more to run with.Whether or not the internet got it 100% right, the name Gabbi Zuniga is now tied to one of the most explosive and talked-about sports lawsuits of 2025. From anonymous accuser to viral figure, her identity reveal (or alleged reveal) has added even more layers of drama, confusion, and nonstop speculation to an already chaotic, messy, and headline-dominating story that shows no signs of slowing down.Also read - Inside the Shannon Sharpe lawsuit: A full timeline of the sexual assault case, lawyers, leaked videos, and what comes next","The name gabbi zuniga first started trending on twitter and tiktok shortly after news of the shannon sharpe lawsuit broke.

Read Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan full letter to employees

Team,

Today we reported our Q1 2025 results. It was a step in the right direction as we delivered revenue, gross margin and EPS (earnings per share) above our guidance, driven by Dave and Michelle’s leadership. I want to thank them both, and all of you, for the good execution.

We need to build on this progress — and it won’t be easy. We are navigating an increasingly volatile and uncertain macroeconomic environment, which is reflected in our Q2 outlook. On top of that, there are many areas where we must improve. We need to confront our challenges head-on and take swift actions to get back on track.

As I have said, this starts by revamping our culture. The feedback I have received from our customers and many of you has been consistent. We are seen as too slow, too complex and too set in our ways — and we need to change.

Our flatter Executive Team (ET) structure that I shared last week was a first step. The next step is to drive greater simplicity, speed and collaboration across the entire company. To achieve these objectives, today I am announcing some important changes.

Becoming an Engineering-Focused Company

We need to get back to our roots and empower our engineers. That’s why I elevated our core engineering functions to the ET. And many of the changes we will be driving are designed to make engineers more productive by removing burdensome workflows and processes that slow down the pace of innovation.

To make necessary investments in our engineering talent and technology roadmaps, we need to find new ways to reduce our costs. While we have taken significant actions in the last year, our current cost structure is still well above competitive benchmarks. With that in mind, we have reduced our operating expense and capital spending targets going forward, which I will discuss during our investor call this afternoon.

Flattening the Organization

As we refocus on engineering, we will also remove organizational complexity. Many teams are eight or more layers deep, which creates unnecessary bureaucracy that slows us down. I have asked the ET to take a fresh look at their respective orgs, with a focus on removing layers, increasing spans of control and empowering top performers. Our competitors are lean, fast and agile — and that’s what we must become to improve our execution.

I’ve been surprised to learn that, in recent years, the most important KPI for many managers at Intel has been the size of their teams. Going forward, this will not be the case. I’m a big believer in the philosophy that the best leaders get the most done with the fewest people. We will embrace this mindset across the company, which will include empowering our top talent to make decisions and take greater ownership of key priorities.

There is no way around the fact that these critical changes will reduce the size of our workforce. As I said when I joined, we need to make some very hard decisions to put our company on a solid footing for the future. This will begin in Q2 and we will move as quickly as possible over the next several months.

We are going to be very intentional about where we focus these efforts and how we stack up against the best in the industry. We have learned some valuable lessons from past actions. We must balance our reductions with the need to retain and recruit key talent. I will empower each of my leaders to make the best possible decisions aligned with our top priorities. These decisions will not be made lightly, and we will keep you regularly informed.

Streamlining Our Processes

It has been eye-opening for me to see how much time and energy is spent on internal administrative work that does not move our business forward. We need to radically simplify this to maximize the time spent focusing on our customers.

I am instructing our leaders to eliminate unnecessary meetings and significantly reduce the number of meeting attendees. Too much valuable time is being wasted. We will also modernize processes with a focus on live dashboards and better data to ensure we have the real-time insights we need to make better and faster decisions.

In addition, I have decided to make our formal Insights and OKR requirements optional. While it’s crucial for us to stay accountable for our results and receive feedback on our performance, I believe we can achieve this in a simpler and more flexible way. Along the same lines, we will cut back on time-consuming corporate administrative tasks such as non-essential training and documentation.

Returning to the Office

Our existing policy is that our hybrid employees should spend approximately three days per week on site. Adherence to this policy has been uneven at best. I strongly believe that our sites need to be vibrant hubs of collaboration that reflect our culture in action.

When we spend time together in person, it fosters more engaging and productive discussion and debate. It drives better and faster decision-making. And it strengthens our connection with colleagues.

With that in mind, we will be updating our policy to require four days per week on site by Sept. 1. I wanted to tell you well in advance so that you have time to make any adjustments to your daily routines. We are going to work hard in the meantime to ensure sites are ready to operate at full capacity. Your local leadership will share site-specific details and seek your input on how to create the best possible on-site experience.

Building a New Intel

I realize this is a lot to take in, but we are playing from behind and we need to rally as a team to put ourselves in the best possible position to win.

This requires us to be laser-focused on developing the best products. We need to delight our customers and earn their trust by delivering the performance, quality and reliability they need to succeed. We must demonstrate predictable execution and ensure on-time delivery. And we need to deliver consistent returns for our shareholders.

There are two ways teams can respond at make-or-break moments like this: They can look at the gap they need to close and give up — or they can look inside themselves and fight like never before.

I made my choice last month when I decided to join you all, and there is no place I would rather be right now. I came on board knowing full well this would be the most challenging job of my career, but also the most motivating and fulfilling — because we have opportunities ahead that most people don’t get in their careers.

I’m talking about the opportunity to fundamentally reinvent an industry icon. To pull off a comeback that will be studied in business schools for generations to come. To create new technologies and deploy them at scale to change the world for the better.

Intel was once widely seen as the world’s most innovative company. There’s no reason we can’t get back there, so long as we drive the changes needed to improve.

It’s going to be hard. It will require painful decisions. But we will make them knowing it’s what we must do to serve our customers better as we build a new Intel for the future – and I have great confidence in the power of our team and our people to make it happen.

Thank you for everything you did in Q1. I look forward to talking more tomorrow during our All Company Meeting.

Lip-Bu Tan

Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has announced sweeping restructuring measures including layoffs, management cuts, and an expanded return-to-office mandate as the struggling chipmaker attempts to regain its competitive edge. The changes aim to eliminate ""unnecessary bureaucracy"" and streamline operations to foster innovation, and Tan notes that “this starts by revamping our [company’s] culture.""""I've been surprised to learn that, in recent years, the most important KPI for many managers at Intel has been the size of their teams. Going forward, this will not be the case. I'm a big believer in the philosophy that the best leaders get the most done with the fewest people,"" Tan wrote in a company memo. The company didn’t specify the exact number of job cuts, but with around 108,900 employees at the end of last year, reports suggest up to 20% of the workforce could be impacted.""Many teams are eight or more layers deep, which creates unnecessary bureaucracy that slows us down,"" Tan wrote in a company memo. The new CEO, who has been at the helm for only five weeks, is targeting $1.5 billion in operating expense reductions over the next two years.The flattening will begin in Q2, and Tan says will be continuing into the next few months.These cuts follow a previous round of layoffs just eight months ago when Intel eliminated 15,000 positions.The restructuring prioritizes engineering talent and aims to make engineers ""more productive by removing burdensome workflows and processes that slow down the pace of innovation."" Tan is shifting focus away from measuring management success by team size toward a leaner structure emphasizing execution.The announcement followed Intel's underwhelming first-quarter earnings, highlighting the company's ongoing challenges in adapting to the industry's pivot toward artificial intelligence—a priority CEO Tan emphasized for the future.Intel also recently announced that starting September 1, it will require four in-office days weekly from its employees. This change replaced the company's two-day remote policy to boost collaboration. Tan made this announcement as a part of a strategic roadmap during the company’s Q1 2025 earnings call.","Ceo lip-bu tan: ""we are seen as too slow, too complex and too set in our ways — and we need to change"" tan: we need to get back to our roots and empower our engineers.

Amazon has marked a significant milestone in its Project Kuiper by successfully launching its first internet satellites. The satellites, deployed via the United Launch Alliance Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, are part of a planned constellation of 3,236 satellites aimed at delivering global broadband services. This move positions Amazon as a direct competitor to SpaceX’s Starlink, which dominates the satellite internet market with over 7,000 operational satellites.

Bangladesh Currency Crisis: Bangladesh faces currency crisis as central bank halts issuing notes featuring Mujibur Rahman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-faces-currency-crisis-as-central-bank-halts-issuing-notes-featuring-mujibur-rahman/articleshow/120714882.cms,"Approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused

DHAKA: The central bank of Bangladesh has apparently incurred a huge financial loss due to the interim govt’s decision not to issue previously printed notes, with approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remaining unused. The decision aligns with govt’s efforts to diminish Bangabandhu’s presence in public memory.Although bank officials are unwilling to discuss the matter publicly, many, on conditions of anonymity, said the longstanding tradition of obtaining new notes from Bangladesh Bank has been abruptly halted, creating a crisis in the market. On the one hand, the printed money is being wasted without use; on the other hand, customers are suffering as a result, they added.“Notes of various denominations are printed using paper and ink purchased with people’s taxes. Millions of notes with Bangabandhu’s picture are still lying in the vaults of various banks. The Security Printing Corporation does not have the capacity to cancel all the notes at once and print new ones. Therefore, notes with Bangabandhu’s picture cann’t be suddenly cancelled,” Ziauddin Ahmed, former executive director of Bangladesh Bank and former managing director of Security Printing Corporation, told reporters.In this situation, he suggested the printed notes be circulated in the market to alleviate public suffering. “When new design notes come into the market, the old ones should be gradually withdrawn. Generally, notes printed once can be used for a maximum of four to five years,” Ahmed said.According to media reports, Bangladesh Bank is unable to issue new notes to banks in line with demand. The crisis became evident following the country’s political upheaval in Aug last year.Since all forms of currency, including metal coins, feature Mujibur’s image, Bangladesh Bank abruptly stopped issuing new notes early April. As a result, the notes featuring Bangabandhu’s image are not reaching the market. Shops, banks, and citizens are now left with torn and old, dirty notes.According to sources at Bangladesh Bank, the Security Printing Corporation is set to begin printing new design notes next month. In the first phase, new design notes of 20, 50, and 1,000 taka will be printed and subsequently released in the market through banks.","Approximately taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused.

SEOUL: Chinese artificial intelligence app DeepSeek was transferring personal data to a cloud services platform without users' consent while it was still available for download, South Korea 's data protection authority said on Thursday.The Personal Information Protection Commission ( PIPC ) said the information, which included device, network, and user inputs in AI prompts, was transferred to servers at Beijing platform Volcano Engine .DeepSeek's R1 chatbot stunned investors and industry insiders in January with its ability to match the functions of its Western competitors at a fraction of the cost.However, countries including South Korea, Italy and Australia and some US states have questioned DeepSeek's storage of user data and have banned or restricted its use.The PIPC launched an investigation in February and said DeepSeek would no longer be available for download until a review of its personal data collection practices was completed.""Initially, DeepSeek transferred personal data to companies located in China and the United States without obtaining users' consent or disclosing this in the privacy policy at the time the service was launched,"" commission official Nam Seok told reporters.""In particular, it was confirmed that DeepSeek transferred not only device, network, and app information, but also user inputs in AI prompts to Volcano Engine,"" he said.Following the investigation, DeepSeek ""acknowledged it had insufficiently considered Korea 's data protection laws, expressed its willingness to cooperate with the commission, and voluntarily suspended new downloads from domestic app markets"", Nam said.DeepSeek did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It has said that data was collected in ""secure servers located in the People's Republic of China"".The company claims its AI tool was built using less sophisticated chips than its competitors, slashing the cost. The app was downloaded tens of millions of times in just a few weeks after its launch.Volcano Engine is a Beijing-based cloud service platform owned by ByteDance, which is also the parent company of the hugely popular platform TikTok.Asked about the data transfer to Volcano Engine, DeepSeek said it was sent ""for the purpose of addressing security vulnerabilities and improving user interface and experience"", Nam said.","Deepseek's r1 chatbot stunned investors and industry insiders in january with its ability to match the functions of its western competitors at a fraction of the cost.

As Dubai races ahead with its 15-minute city vision, bolstered by initiatives like the 6,500-kilometre Dubai Walk Master Plan, India is retrofitting its dense, chaotic metros with digital overlays: sensor-based governance, predictive maintenance, and AI-powered mobility. One is building from a blank slate, the other upgrading a living, breathing organism. But both are turning to policy, platforms, and partnerships to solve a shared question: what should the city of tomorrowlike?And increasingly, the answer lies in code, climate, and collaboration.Together, these twin models, Dubai’s top-down agility and India’s bottom-up scale, are forming a high-tech corridor of innovation, where policy frameworks enable rapid deployment, and tech talent transforms urban life into programmable infrastructure.It’s a powerful idea: cities are not just built—they’re engineered.“In India, the challenge is integrating technology into older infrastructure— overcrowded streets, legacy systems, limited digital touchpoints. In Dubai, the challenge is the transient nature— of people and assets. Roads, bridges, and corridors are constantly evolving. So, plug-and-play solutions must be fast, seamless, and adaptive,” says Sumanta Roy, Regional Head for the Middle East, Africa, and Mediterranean at Tata Consultancy Services (TCS).“One is building from a blank slate. The other is upgrading a living, breathing organism. But both are aiming to solve the same question: what should the city of tomorrow feel like?”Roy drew a stark contrast between the urban problems in both regions.That agility has turned Dubai into a global sandbox for emerging technology.A standout example was an IoT-based energy efficiency pilot created for a Dubai retail chain that used real-time footfall and temperature analytics to optimise power use. Another was a computer vision system that detected frontline worker fatigue—first developed with a Dubai government agency and now being expanded globally.Roy emphasised that Dubai’s smart transformation is powered not just by tech but also by policy. “Dubai lays the foundation, provides governance, and then gets out of the way. If you have a good idea, it’s frictionless to launch. After that, the idea has to prove itself. It’s a perfect setup,” he said.The TCS team is embedded across the city’s institutional and regulatory matrix. They’ve worked with the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) to streamline builder connections— cutting delays, waste, and inefficiencies.The company is also contributing to what is expected to be the world’s largest net-zero energy building, spearheaded by DEWA. Their partnership with the Mohammed Bin Rashid School of Government includes sponsoring Emirati students to pursue technology-focused governance programmes. “It’s about preparing the next generation of government leaders to be technologically fluent,” Roy added.The impact of smart city tech is perhaps most visible in Dubai’s property sector, where data, design, and marketing are converging. “Dubai is setting the gold standard for smart cities, and real estate is right at the heart of this transformation,” said Imran Khan, Founder and CEO of PIXL Global, a company developing immersive visualisation tools for property developers and investors.“Tech is changing the game for off-plan properties—AI, data analytics, and automation are making it faster, smarter, and more immersive to bring the project to life and sell it.” His team builds data-driven content, predictive market insights, and 3D marketing platforms that go far beyond traditional brochures.Buyers today expect more than just glossy renderings– they want interactive experiences that help them make confident decisions in their investments.Their tools help personalise content, accelerate go-to-market strategies, and offer predictive insights signalling a shift in how real estate interacts with urban tech.While PIXL helps visualise the smart city, Michael Quinn, Operations Manager at ALEC Facades, helps build it– literally.“Dubai is ahead of the curve,” said Quinn. “There’s a global trend toward reducing long commutes and creating integrated, 15-minute cities. Young people today want convenience and balance. Dubai gets that.”The December 2024 approval of the Dubai Walk Master Plan envisions a 6,500 km climate-controlled pedestrian network connecting 160 neighbourhoods. This initiative will turn walking, cycling, and short-distance commuting into default behaviours– no longer dictated by temperature or traffic. It also reimagines how architecture can serve both beauty and utility.“At ALEC Facades, we collaborate from the early stages,” Quinn explained. “That means working with architects and developers right at concept level to align façades with long-term goals– sustainability, modularity, and resident comfort.”ALEC’s use of freeform façades— column-free designs— enhances flexibility and visual impact.“You can go 60 or 70 meters without a single supporting column underneath,” Quinn said. “That opens up vast layouts and allows for adaptive, efficient spaces.”These façades also allow embedded smart elements— from LED panels and adaptive shading to solar glass and UV-filtering skins. The result is a more intelligent building envelope— one that regulates heat, generates power, and enhances well-being.“And the entire construction is more sustainable because it’s modular, precise, and far less resource-intensive.”Adding to this is India’s role in this transformation. India has some of the most highly trained BIM developers globally. “They are contributing heavily to projects across the UAE,” added Quinn.BIM— Building Information Modelling— has become the norm for both public and private developments in Dubai. “It lets us visualise the entire building, detect conflicts, coordinate timelines, and ensure every subcontractor is working from the same model. It's a complete game-changer,” Roy added.He explained the India-UAE tech corridor is becoming a two-way flow. “Many of the smart city tools we develop in India— whether it’s in data science, AI, or infrastructure automation— are now being tested, deployed, and scaled in Dubai.”As Indian entrepreneurs and engineers increasingly turn to Dubai for expansion, the city’s role as a launchpad becomes clear. “I know many fintech and edtech founders from India who moved to Dubai to launch their next phase globally,” Roy said. “Dubai is a trampoline. You jump from India, land here, and go everywhere else.”With smoother regulations, access to global capital, and proximity to Europe, Africa, and Southeast Asia, Dubai is becoming a strategic base for AI startups, deep tech ventures, and climate-focused companies from India. “A friend of mine moved his entire machine learning business here— shut shop in India, made Dubai his base, and now services Western Europe and India from here,” Roy added.Still, Roy cautions against assuming a one-size-fits-all strategy. “Set-piece strategies don’t work in the Middle East. You have to be local in your mindset and execution. But the openness to ideas here—especially in Dubai—is unmatched. Whether it’s AI, IoT, or digital assets, Dubai has become a global reference point.”In the grand arc of urban development, India and Dubai offer two contrasting models— one slow and messy but rich in scale and resilience; the other swift, deliberate, and experimental by design. Together, they are co-authoring a new smart city blueprint—one that blends physical infrastructure with invisible intelligence, and policy with product design.“The city of the future is not just a dream— it’s being built right now,” said Michael Quinn. “And we’re proud to play a part in shaping it.”Click this link for more on Business in Dubai.","Dubai and india are building cities from a blank slate. But both are turning to policy, platforms, and partnerships to solve a shared question: what should the city of tomorrowlike?

"UPS to cut 20,000 jobs and close over 70 facilities amid Amazon demand decline",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/ups-to-cut-20000-jobs-and-close-over-70-facilities-amid-amazon-demand-decline/articleshow/120739242.cms,"UPS is set to slash almost 20,000 jobs and shut down several facilities across its network as the delivery giant undergoes a major shake-up in response to falling demand from its largest customer, Amazon.The Atlanta-based company said on Tuesday that it plans to carry out the job cuts this year, and close 73 leased or owned buildings by the end of June. More closures may follow as the company continues to review its operations.“The actions we are taking to reconfigure our network and reduce cost across our business could not be timelier,” CEO Carol Tomé said in a statement on Tuesday. ""The macro environment may be uncertain, but with our actions, we will emerge as an even stronger, more nimble UPS.”The overhaul followed a January announcement that UPS and Amazon had agreed to slash the volume of packages delivered by UPS by more than 50% by the second half of 2026. The two companies have been partners for nearly three decades, but Tomé made it clear during the firm’s fourth-quarter earnings call that the deal was no longer sustainable on current terms.“Amazon is our largest customer but it’s not our most profitable customer,” she said at the time.“Its margin is very dilutive to the US domestic business.UPS currently employs about 490,000 workers.The company also released its first-quarter financial results on Tuesday, reporting net income of $1.19 billion, or $1.40 per share, for the three months ending 31 March. Adjusted earnings stood at $1.49 per share, topping analysts’ expectations of $1.44, according to Zacks Investment Research.Revenue also came in ahead of forecasts, reaching $21.55 billion compared to the $21.06 billion anticipated by Wall Street.However, UPS said it would not be updating its full-year forecast amid ongoing macroeconomic uncertainty. The company previously projected 2025 revenue of about $89 billion.UPS shares saw a modest rise in morning trading following the announcement.","The atlanta-based company said on tuesday that it plans to carry out the job cuts this year, and close 73 leased or owned buildings by the end of june.

India packs fizz for Coke amid weak global markets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-packs-fizz-for-coke-amid-weak-global-markets/articleshow/120744865.cms,"MUMBAI: India, alongside China and Brazil, drove volume growth for American beverage giant Coca-Cola in the March quarter even as the company contended with a weakening consumer sentiment in developed markets like the US, which weighed on its share of volume gains in those regions. The firm's consolidated volume grew 2% during the quarter. Asia Pacific recorded a 6% volume growth, led by India, while volumes declined by 3% in North America. Coca-Cola reports unit case volume, which factors in the total number of unit cases of beverages sold by the company and its bottling partners.""We saw good momentum in Asia Pacific, driven by a good quarter in India in particular. We saw strong volume growth across our portfolio in India and increased household penetration,"" said James Quincey, Chairman and CEO at The Coca-Cola Company during the firm's earnings call on Tuesday.The company's net revenues declined by 2% to $11.1 billion due to currency headwinds and the impact of refranchising bottling operations. ""In India, trademark Coca-Cola and Thums Up , a cherished regional brand, are fuelling consumers and contributed to double-digit volume growth for the market in the first quarter,"" the company said. Summers arrived early in parts of India this year, helping beverage players. Coca-Cola is betting on its all-weather strategy to power growth amid macro-uncertainty posed by tariffs.""We are not immune to global trade dynamics. The imperative is to make global brands locally relevant,"" executives said. The company competes with global rival PepsiCo and regional players like Campa Cola in India.Coca-Cola's winning strategy for India is to tap into its portfolio of local brands for the market like Thums Up, Maaza and Limca which the company had earlier indicated, gives it enough leverage to fight rivals. ""Our portfolio in India is strong if not stronger than just about anywhere in the world because we have the benefit of local brands in our portfolio...the good thing is we have been in business for a long, long time and over that period have built our playbooks as to how to compete, how to win and we are more excited about the prospects for our business in India right now than we have ever been,"" CFO John Murphy had said during his trip to India earlier this year.","India, alongside china and brazil, drove volume growth for american beverage giant coca-cola in the march quarter.
