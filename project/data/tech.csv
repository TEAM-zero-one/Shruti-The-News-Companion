What Google’s ‘mini incident report’ says on recent outage

Multiple Google Cloud and Google Workspace products experienced increased 503 errors in external API requests, impacting customers.

From our initial analysis, the issue occurred due to an invalid automated quota update to our API management system which was distributed globally, causing external API requests to be rejected. To recover we bypassed the offending quota check, which allowed recovery in most regions within 2 hours. However, the quota policy database in us-central1 became overloaded, resulting in much longer recovery in that region. Several products had moderate residual impact (e.g. backlogs) for up to an hour after the primary issue was mitigated and a small number recovering after that.

Google will complete a full Incident Report in the following days that will provide a detailed root cause.

Prevent our API management platform from failing due to invalid or corrupt data.

Prevent metadata from propagating globally without appropriate protection, testing and monitoring in place.

Improve system error handling and comprehensive testing for handling of invalid data.

Sam Altman just dropped a big AI prediction for 2026; experts are skeptical,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sam-altman-just-dropped-a-big-ai-prediction-for-2026-experts-are-skeptical/articleshow/121811592.cms,"Sam Altman AI prediction for 2026

What Sam Altman really said: AI with ""novel insights"" by 2026

""By 2026, we will likely see the arrival of systems that can figure out novel insights,""

What does ""novel insight"" really mean

An AI race for survival: Other technology giants are not lagging behind

Google DeepMind just released a paper on AlphaEvolve, a coding AI agent that created innovative solutions to challenging math problems, something even accomplished researchers hadn't tried.

Anthropic founder of Claude AI, established a research grant program in May 2025 to support research projects that employ AI to generate scientific hypotheses and conduct experiments.

FutureHouse, founded by ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt, states its AI assisted in an actual scientific breakthrough, though details are kept under wraps.

Lila Sciences, a startup by now-former OpenAI researcher Kenneth Stanley, has raised $200 million to create a lab dedicated to teaching AI models to ask more intelligent scientific questions, a basic prerequisite for insight.

Why 'novel insights' from AI might still be useless, experts say

In a fresh thought-provoking article entitled ""The Gentle Singularity,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has again moved in with a daring prediction: by 2026, artificial intelligence systems will be able to make ""novel insights."" The claim may sound ambiguous in itself, yet in the context of the developing objectives of OpenAI and the wider competitive scene of AI research, it weighs. Altman, who is famous for his futurist vision and bold declarations regarding artificial general intelligence (AGI), presents this forecast as part of an extended evolution of human society, one where AI remakes work, energy, innovation, and even scientific breakthroughs.His essay, released June 10, 2025, is more than prediction; it can be used as an unofficial guide for where OpenAI and its competitors are going next. This race towards AI systems coming up with genuine, new ideas instead of merely recombining present information is becoming the next arms race in technology innovation. With major breakthroughs being achieved by Google DeepMind, Anthropic, and upstart companies such as Lila Sciences and FutureHouse, the stakes are high not just for corporate hegemony but for the future of science itself.Altman's essay describes his vision for the ""gentle singularity,"" an era in which AGI does not destroy or dismantle civilization but rather becomes a productive, evolutionary partner to humans. Perhaps one of the most remarkable things he predicts is this:This matter-of-fact-sounding sentence has huge implications. First of all, it indicates that OpenAI is approaching a level of model capability where artificial intelligence can move past summarization, prediction, or pattern matching and start to think creatively. This is the distinction between an AI that simply reports data and one that adds meaningfully to human knowledge.OpenAI President and co-founder Greg Brockman has recently supported this concept when announcing the o3 and o4-mini models in April 2025. ""These were the first models scientists used to create useful new ideas in their field,"" he declared, suggesting that OpenAI is already developing the kind of AI that Altman described in his essay.The ""novel insight"" in AI is the capability of the AI model to generate new, valuable, and hitherto not thought-provoking ideas or hypotheses. This characteristic stretches much beyond the current realm of capabilities of AI chatbots and big language models that are based on spewing out known facts.Altman's prophetic essay is not isolated. Over the past few months, a host of major players have taken strategic actions in line with the premise of ""novel insight"" creation:Even as the hype sets in, top AI minds remain hesitant. Hugging Face Chief Science Officer Thomas Wolf recently contended that existing models can't pose genuinely new questions, a precondition for any scientific breakthrough. Likewise, Kenneth Stanley himself concedes that the issue is ""fundamentally difficult,"" not merely a matter of computational horsepower but modeling what humans find ""interesting"" or ""meaningful.""Creativity is not just computation, but intuition and judgment areas where AI still lags. This means that even if models can generate new hypotheses, it remains unclear how useful, testable, or correct these insights will be.","Openai ceo sam altman predicts that by 2026, artificial intelligence systems will be able to make ""novel insights"" race towards ai systems coming up with genuine, new ideas is becoming the next arms race in technology innovation.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang recently said that the next decade will be the era of autonomous driving cars, robots and autonomous machines. In an interview with CNBC’s Arjun Kharpal Thursday at the Viva Tech conference in Paris, Huang said “This is going to be the decade of AV [autonomous vehicles], robotics, autonomous machines.”Nvidia is playing an important role in the rise of autonomous vehicles (AVs), supplying both hardware and software to support their development. The US chip giant is a key enabler behind the growing fleet of self-driving cars , especially in the U.S., where Waymo — owned by Google — operates robotaxi services in cities like San Francisco, Phoenix, and Los Angeles.China has also seen growing adoption, with companies like Baidu and Pony.ai running their own robotaxi networks.Recently, Huang attended the London Tech Week where he said that AI is a “great equalizer” as it enables anyone to program using everyday language. Admitting that computing was hard historically, he said “We had to learn programming languages. We had to architect it. We had to design these computers that are very complicated”. “Now, all of a sudden ... there’s a new programming language. This new programming language is called ‘human,’” he added. ""Most people don't know C++, very few people know Python, and everybody, as you know, knows human.”He continued: “The way you program a computer today, to ask the computer to do something for you, even write a program, generate images, write a poem — just ask it nicely.”“And the thing that’s really, really quite amazing is the way you program an AI is like the way you program a person.”Explaining further, Huang gave an example saying, “You say, 'You are an incredible poet. You are deeply steeped in Shakespeare, and I would like you to write a poem to describe today's keynote.' Without very much effort, this AI would help you generate such a wonderful poem.”","N nvidia ceo jensen huang said the next decade will be the era of autonomous driving cars, robots and autonomous machines.

HOME: Where I can look ugly and enjoy it.

Today morning when I was driving my Ferrari, the alarm woke me up.

Dear Math, please grow up and solve your problems. I'm tired of answering them for you.

Normal is boring.

I need Google in my brain.

I like to hang out with people that make me forget to look at my phone.

I've found the recipe for happiness. Can someone just send me some money so that I can buy the ingredients?

I love food and sleep. If I give you a bit of food or text you all night, that means something.

Be your own kind of beautiful

Unlike protons I don’t deal with negativity

ME my room music internet connection no study a perfect day

If u can’t do great things then do small and simple things in a great way

Real beauty is to be true to oneself that’s what makes me feel good

Be yourself everyone else is already taken

I don’t have an attitude problem you have a perception problem

Work hard in silence let your success be your noise

Dream without fear love without limits

Keep calm and let karma finish it

I’m not a player I’m the game

Don’t tell people your dreams show them

Success is the best revenge for anything

I’m not special I’m just a limited edition

Be so good they can’t ignore you

I may be wrong but I doubt it

Turn your wounds into wisdom

Live life to the fullest and focus on the positive

Be a voice not an echo

Keep your heels head and standards high

My life my rules my attitude

Make today so awesome that yesterday gets jealous

Life is short make every hair flip fabulous

Be your own kind of beautiful

The best things in life are free The second best are very expensive

Confidence is not they will like me Confidence is I’ll be fine if they don’t

Collect moments not things

You are enough just as you are

Find yourself and be that

Don’t be a prisoner of your past Become the architect of your future

Choose people who choose you

Be fearless in pursuing what sets your soul on fire

Elegance is when the inside is as beautiful as the outside

Don’t stop until you’re proud

I am not a product of my circumstances I am a product of my decisions

Stay real stay loyal or stay away from me

Life is too short to be serious all the time So if you cant laugh at yourself call me Ill laugh at you

Chase your dreams but always know the road that will lead you home again

Be yourself everyone else is already taken

I don't have an attitude problem you have a perception problem

Work hard in silence let your success be your noise

Dream without fear love without limits

My wallet is like an onion When I open it it makes me cry

I cant believe I forgot to go to the gym today Thats 7 years in a row now

Im not clumsy The floor hates me the table and chairs are bullies and the walls get in my way

I would lose weight but I hate losing

Im not sleeping Im just resting my eyes

I followed a diet but it didn't follow me back So I unfollowed it

If there was an award for laziness I'd probably send someone to pick it up for me

I don't sweat I sparkle

Id agree with you but wed both be wrong

Im on my second guardian angel My first one quit and is now in therapy

I thought I wanted a career I just wanted paychecks

I’m not lazy I’m just on energy-saving mode

I need a six-month vacation twice a year

I put the pro in procrastinate

My bed and I are in a committed relationship

Running late is my cardio

Adulting is like folding a fitted sheet nobody really knows how

WiFi food my bed perfection achieved

I don’t rise and shine I caffeinate and hope

I’m not arguing I’m just explaining why I’m right

I followed my heart now I’m lost

Life is short smile while you still have teeth

If Monday had a face I’d punch it

I’m on a seafood diet I see food and I eat it

I whisper to my WiFi when it’s slow hoping it feels loved

I tried to be normal once worst two minutes ever

My hobbies include eating and complaining that I’m getting fat

I’m not short I’m concentrated awesome

You are the reason I look at my phone and smile

In your arms is where I find my peace

You make my heart skip a beat

I didn’t choose you my heart did

Forever is not long enough with you

Every love story is beautiful but ours is my favorite

With you every moment is magical

You are the poem I never knew how to write

You had me at hello

I still fall for you every single day

Your smile is literally the cutest thing I’ve ever seen

I just want to make you happy because you make me happy

You are my today and all of my tomorrows

Loving you is the best decision I ever made

The best feeling is when you look at me and smile

Emotional WhatsApp captions



I wish I could turn back time and make everything right

The saddest thing is feeling alone in a crowd

I’m drowning in memories and there’s no way out

Every heart has a pain only the way of expressing it is different

The hardest part is pretending to be happy

Some days I just want to disappear

It’s hard to find happiness when you feel like nothing

The silence after an argument is the loudest sound

It hurts when you realize you aren’t as important to someone as you thought

Saying goodbye to the one you love is like saying goodbye to your own happiness

Sometimes you have to pretend everything is fine when it’s not

I’m not okay but I’ll pretend to be

Behind every strong person is a story that left them broken

Loving you was my favorite mistake

It’s hard to forget someone who was your entire life

I miss the old us

You left without a goodbye and now I’m left with the pieces

I wish I could stop loving you but my heart refuses to listen

Sometimes the people who are thousands of miles away from you can make you feel better than the ones right beside you

I thought I mattered but I was wrong

I’m tired of fighting for a love that’s already gone

The scars you can’t see are the hardest to heal

Tears speak when the heart can't

Smiling outside, breaking inside

Sometimes silence is the loudest cry

I’m tired of pretending I’m fine

Lost in a world that doesn’t see me

It hurts, but I’ll deal with it

The worst pain is being forgotten

I miss the old me

We were perfect… until we weren’t

Crying isn’t a weakness, it’s a release

The hardest part is acting like it’s okay

Some scars never show, but they’re the deepest

Loved too much, lost too hard

Trust once broken is hard to rebuild

Happiness left and didn’t say goodbye

I’m okay… just tired of everything

When memories hurt more than they heal

Faking smiles is an exhausting job

Some wounds time doesn't heal

I'm not mad, just disappointed

Hope hurts more than letting go

People change, promises break

Missing you is a daily struggle

I wish feelings had an off switch

Loneliness feels louder at night

We said forever, but forever ended early

No more expectations, no more pain

Too broken to be fixed

Love left, emptiness stayed

Heart full of words never said

Life WhatsApp captions



Life isn’t perfect but it has perfect moments

Just because you’re breathing doesn’t mean you’re living

Life goes on with or without you

Collect moments not things

Life is a one time offer use it well

Don’t count the days make the days count

Simplicity is the keynote of true life

Life is short smile while you still have teeth

Your vibe attracts your tribe

Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations

Life begins at the end of your comfort zone

Stay close to people who feel like sunshine

In the end we only regret the chances we didn’t take

Be yourself life’s too short to be anyone else

Life’s beauty lies in small moments

Life is tough but so are you

Fall in love with taking care of yourself

Live the story you want to tell

Don’t survive thrive

Life doesn’t have to be perfect to be beautiful

Let your life be your message

Live less out of habit more out of intent

You only live once but if you do it right once is enough

Life is a journey enjoy the ride

Don’t just exist live

Life is made of moments not milestones

Be the energy you want to attract

Make peace with your past so it doesn’t spoil your present

The best view comes after the hardest climb

Life rewards the brave

Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans

Live life to the fullest

To live is the rarest thing in the world Most people exist that is all

Life is short and its up to you to make it sweet

In the end its not the years in your life that count Its the life in your years

The purpose of life is to believe to hope and to strive

Life is about making an impact not making an income

Life is straightforward but we insist on complicating it

Life is a journey that must be traveled no matter how bad the roads and accommodations

Life is like riding a bicycle To keep your balance you must keep moving

Life is 10 percent what happens to us and 90 percent how we react to it

Life isn't about finding yourself. It's about creating yourself

Life is too important to be taken seriously

Life is short smile while you still have teeth

Life is a onetime offer use it well

Life is a beautiful struggle

Life is short and it is up to you to make it sweet

Life is a daring adventure or nothing at all

Life is made of ever so many partings welded together

Life is trying things to see if they work

Most remembered line from Steve Jobs’s Stanford speech

“Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life”

“Stay hungry, stay foolish.”

A speech about more than tech

Apple CEO Tim Cook recently marked the 20th anniversary of Steve Jobs’ iconic 2005 Stanford commencement address by sharing a tribute to the late Apple co-founder on social media. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Cook wrote “It’s hard to believe it’s been 20 years since Steve told Stanford graduates to stay hungry and stay foolish.” He continued, “His powerful advice still rings true, and I hope it helps guide this year’s new grads as they begin their journey to become tomorrow’s leaders.”In the post, Cook also shared a link to a newly updated version of Jobs’ famous speech, hosted on the Steve Jobs Archive website. The video has been enhanced from standard to high definition. The 2005 video, has been watched over 120 million times, and is one of the most influential commencement addresses in history. It has also been reproduced in media and school curricula around the world. ( You can watch it here As mentioned on the website, Job’s speech even helped inspire the Cleveland Cavaliers' 2016 NBA comeback, when LeBron James played a clip of it before Game 3 of the Finals. While the webpage includes rare photos, early drafts, and behind-the-scenes details about how the speech came together.The speech delivered by Jobs – a college dropout to one of the world’s top universities, has resonated deeply with audiences over the years. It included three personal stories from Jobs’ life, and its most remembered lines were deeply reflective:andAccording to the Steve Jobs Archive , Jobs spent months preparing for the speech. He worked on drafts, asked friends for advice, and collaborated closely with his wife, Laurene.On stage, Jobs wore jeans, a black shirt, and Birkenstocks under his graduation robe. Despite the heat and distractions in the stadium, he delivered his speech word-for-word. “This is the closest I’ve ever gotten to a college graduation,” he joked as he began.After the event, the class co-presidents sent him a thank-you note. Jobs replied: “Thank you all very much. It was really hard for me to prepare for this, but I loved it (especially when it was over…).”Though Jobs was known as a visionary in technology, his Stanford address focused on universal human experiences—love, loss, mortality, and staying true to oneself. He once said, “People sometimes forget that they are very unique… The whole computer industry wants to forget about the humanist side.” The speech was a reminder that he hadn’t.The Steve Jobs Archive now preserves that legacy with rare artifacts, including Jobs’ handwritten speech drafts, his Reed College acceptance letter, and even the Whole Earth Catalog that inspired his famous closing line.",Steve jobs stanford speech is one of the most watched speeches in history.

Google Cloud services completely restored: Here’s what the company said

Google has announced the full restoration of its cloud services and associated platforms following a significant global outage that impacted numerous Google products and third-party applications late night on June 12. The disruption, which stemmed from an issue within Google Cloud, caused widespread accessibility problems for tens of thousands of users worldwide. Google Cloud acknowledged the problem on its status page, stating that multiple products were experiencing varying levels of service disruption. ""Our engineers are continuing to mitigate the issue, and we have confirmation that the issue is recovered in some locations,"" Google Cloud said, though it could not provide a timeline for full resolution.The outage began early Thursday (June 12), leading to elevated error rates and complete unavailability for services such as Google Search, Google Meet, Google Lens, and various Google Workspace applications including Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Calendar. Beyond Google's own ecosystem, popular third-party platforms like Spotify and Discord, which rely on Google Cloud infrastructure, also reported extensive downtime.Google Cloud engineers identified the root cause of the disruption, which was attributed to an identity and access management (IAM) failure within Google Cloud's systems. This misconfiguration triggered a cascade of issues across critical cloud components.Google confirmed that it had applied appropriate mitigations and was seeing signs of widespread recovery. ""Our engineers have identified the root cause and have applied appropriate mitigations,"" Google Cloud stated on its status page.“All the services are fully recovered from the service issue. We will publish analysis of this incident once we have completed our internal investigation. We thank you for your patience while we worked on resolving the issue,” added the company.","Google has announced the full restoration of its cloud services and associated platforms following a significant global outage.

This marks Paytm's steepest single-day drop since February 2024, as investor sentiment took a hit following the official denial.The sharp fall in the stock price of One 97 Communications, Paytm’s parent company, came after the finance ministry on Wednesday clarified that reports suggesting MDR charges on UPI payments were ""false, baseless, and misleading.""""Speculation and claims that the MDR will be charged on UPI transactions are completely false, baseless, and misleading. Such baseless and sensation-creating speculations cause needless uncertainty, fear and suspicion among our citizens. The Government remains fully committed to promoting digital payments via UPI,"" Finance ministry wrote on X.The clarification came after some media reports suggested the government was considering levying MDR on UPI transactions only for large merchants to support banks and payment providers.Earlier in March, the Payments Council of India (PCI), which represents over 180 digital payment firms, urged the government to reconsider the introduction of merchant discount rate (MDR) on UPI transactions and RuPay debit cards.The industry body has sought an MDR of 0.3% on UPI transactions only for large merchants and a nominal MDR on RuPay debit cards for all merchants.The council warned that without MDR, the digital payments infrastructure could become unsustainable, affecting innovation, cybersecurity, and customer support.PCI argued that the policy, in place since January 2020, has put pressure on the payment ecosystem, despite a Rs 1,500 crore government incentive that falls far short of the estimated Rs 10,000 crore needed annually.

If the rollout happens as planned, it would mark a major milestone in Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) program—a technology that has faced years of delays and criticism.Musk also revealed that the first Tesla to fully ""drive itself from the factory end of line all the way to a customer house is June 28.""Earlier, Musk responded to a video on X showing what appears to be one of Tesla's first robotaxis in Austin, a Model Y carrying a passenger with no driver behind the wheel.The car had a ""Robotaxi"" logo on its side.""These are unmodified Tesla cars coming straight from the factory, meaning that every Tesla coming out of our factories is capable of unsupervised self-driving!"" Musk wrote on X.Investors, analysts, and Tesla fans have been closely watching for this moment since Musk said earlier this year that the robotaxi service would launch in Austin sometime in June.In an interview with CNBC last month, Musk outlined initial plans for the service, stating that the vehicles would operate under remote supervision and ""geofenced"".He indicated plans to begin with approximately 10 vehicles, with rapid expansion planned for other metropolitan areas including Los Angeles, San Antonio and San Francisco.Musk has spent years promising fully self-driving Teslas “next year,” but now the pressure is real as the company begins rolling out its robotaxi service. Tesla's electric vehicle sales have recently dipped, hit by rising competition, the revamp of its popular Model Y, and the backlash from Musk’s political statements.The Austin launch coincides with a reported clash between Musk and US President Donald Trump over tax policy.

Gold price prediction today: MCX Gold August 2025 contract has opened with a spectacular gap up at ₹100,300, marking a massive surge of over 1,800 points from previous levels. This dramatic move is likely triggered by overnight geopolitical tensions on Israel attacks on Iran Nuclear sites. Dollar weakness at 98$, has created a new bullish paradigm for the precious metal. While the gap up presents immediate profit opportunities, seasoned traders are positioning for strategic buy-on-dips entries.The ₹99,000 level, coinciding with the 21-day EMA, represents the most logical support zone for dip buying in this new bullish environment. This level offers multiple confluence factors:1. EMA 21 Support: The 21-period moving average at ₹99,000 provides dynamic support2. Psychological Level: Round number support with strong psychological significance3. Gap Fill Protection: Sufficient distance from gap opening to avoid immediate fill4. Volume Profile: High volume acceptance above ₹99,000 during previous sessions5. Fibonacci Support: 50% retracement of recent rally from ₹97,500 to current levelsThe gap up opening in gold has created a paradigm shift from resistance-based selling to support-based buying strategies. The ₹99,000 level offers an exceptional risk-reward opportunity for traders looking to capitalize on this momentum breakout. However, the elevated volatility demands disciplined execution and strict adherence to risk management protocols.The technical setup strongly favors buyers on any weakness, with multiple confluence factors supporting the ₹99,000 zone.
