'Both India, US-Based Firms Have Raised Concerns': Dhruva Jaishankar On H-1B Fee Hike

Firms will cut H-1B workers



Impact on startups







The Donald Trump administration’s sharp increase in visa fees for H-1B workers has triggered concern among US technology companies, with many considering moving more jobs overseas — the very outcome the policy aimed to prevent.US President Donald Trump announced on Friday a steep $100,000 levy for new H-1B applicants, a visa program long used by tech firms to recruit skilled workers and by international students seeking US employment after postgraduate studies.While the fee applies only to new applicants and not current visa holders, confusion around its rollout and cost has prompted companies to pause hiring and adjust workforce plans.“I have had several conversations with corporate clients … where they have said this new fee is simply unworkable in the US, and it's time for us to start looking for other countries where we can have highly skilled talent,” said Chris Thomas, immigration attorney at Colorado-based law firm Holland & Hart, as quoted by Reuters.“And these are large companies, some of them household names, Fortune 100 type companies, that are saying, we just simply cannot continue.”Previously costing employers only a few thousand dollars, the new $100,000 fee flips the equation, making hiring talent in countries like India, where wages are lower and Big Tech increasingly builds innovation hubs, more attractive.“We probably have to reduce the number of H-1B visa workers we can hire,” said Sam Liang, co-founder and CEO of AI meeting assistant startup Otter.ai.“Some companies may have to outsource some of their workforce — hire maybe in India or other countries just to walk around this H-1B problem,” he added.“Blanket rulings like this are rarely good for immigration,” said Deedy Das, partner at Menlo Ventures, which has invested in startups including AI firm Anthropic.“For larger companies, the cost is not material. For smaller companies, those with fewer than 25 employees, it's much more significant. Big tech CEOs expected this and will pay. For them, fewer small competitors is even an advantage. It’s the smaller startups that suffer most,” he added, as reported by Reuters.Analysts warn the policy could reduce the number of talented immigrants who often go on to launch new firms. A 2022 report from the National Foundation for American Policy found that more than half of US startups valued at $1 billion or more had at least one immigrant founder.","Us president donald trump announced on friday a steep $100,000 levy for new h-1b applicants.

America’s wealthiest philanthropists have seen their fortunes soar over the past two years, yet their charitable giving has not always matched this growth.

General manager Doug Armstrong confirmed the deal on Saturday night, keeping Fowler in St. Louis through the 2028-29 season.

New AI agent 'Quick' signals strategic shift





Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman delivered a pointed message to staff during an internal meeting, criticizing the cloud computing giant for slow product rollouts ahead of its flagship Reinvent conference in December. ""The first and very most important thing we've got to do is make sure that we deliver on the roadmap that we have,"" Garman told employees, according to a meeting transcript reviewed by Reuters.The AWS chief emphasized that customers expect immediate access to announced products rather than mere pre-announcements. ""Increasingly, we're finding that when we launch innovative new things at Reinvent it's valuable if we can actually launch them, as opposed to just pre-announce them,"" Garman said during the all-hands meeting.The internal critique comes as Amazon grapples with mounting criticism over its artificial intelligence strategy. During the company's most recent earnings call, a Morgan Stanley analyst questioned CEO Andy Jassy about Wall Street concerns that ""AWS is falling behind in genAI with concerns about share loss to peers.""Jassy defended Amazon's position in an unusually lengthy eight-minute response, arguing that AI development remains in early stages with room for multiple winners.However, the internal pressure from Garman suggests ongoing urgency within the organization to accelerate product delivery timelines.At the meeting, Garman demonstrated a new internal AI product called ""Quick,"" per Reuters, describing as an ""agentic"" AI system designed to perform tasks with minimal prompting. The tool can analyze documents and web pages while automating customized workflows for regular business processes.Quick will soon be available for testing across all AWS employees, representing the company's latest effort to compete in the rapidly evolving AI landscape. Garman also stressed the importance of customer attendance at Reinvent, targeting over 60,000 attendees to match last year's conference turnout.However, an Amazon spokesperson disputed the Reuters report, calling it a ""gross misinterpretation"" of what was described as an ""inspiring internal conversation.""","Amazon web services ceo matt garman has urged his staff to expedite product rollouts, particularly in ai.

Israeli military transfers data as Microsoft cuts access





Microsoft has cut off cloud computing and AI services to an Israeli military intelligence unit after an investigation revealed the technology was being used for mass surveillance of Palestinian civilians. The tech giant made the decision following a Guardian investigation that exposed how Israel's Unit 8200 stored millions of intercepted Palestinian phone calls on Microsoft's Azure platform.Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and vice chair, announced the termination in an internal memo to employees, stating the company found ""evidence that supports elements of The Guardian's reporting."" The blocked services include cloud storage and AI technologies that Unit 8200 had used to collect and analyze up to ""a million calls an hour"" from Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.An Israeli security official downplayed the impact, telling CNN there is ""no damage to the operational capabilities of the IDF."" Neither the Israel Defense Forces nor the Ministry of Defense responded to requests for comment about the service termination.The No Azure for Apartheid group, which includes of Microsoft employees, had been pressured Microsoft for over a year through protests and demonstrations, called the decision a significant win.""Today's news is a significant and unprecedented win for the campaign and our organizing,"" said Hossam Nasr, an organizer with the group, noting Microsoft became ""the first US tech company to stop the sale of some technologies to the Israeli military since the start of the genocide in Gaza. ""However, the activist group said the action doesn't go far enough, as Microsoft only disabled services to a single unit while ""the vast majority of Microsoft's contract with the Israeli military remains intact."" The group vowed to continue organizing until all their demands are met.The company said it applies its anti-surveillance principles globally and has maintained this stance for over two decades, with Smith noting that customer privacy commitments prevented Microsoft from accessing the surveillance data directly during its investigation.Intelligence sources told the Guardian that Unit 8200 quickly moved the massive data trove out of Microsoft's Dutch servers within days of the original investigation's publication in August. The unit reportedly plans to transfer the surveillance data to Amazon Web Services, though Amazon has not responded to requests for comment.Smith emphasized that Microsoft ""does not provide technology to facilitate mass surveillance of civilians"" and noted the decision doesn't affect the company's broader relationship with Israel, including cybersecurity work.

According to the new timeline, a parking enforcement officer narked the Tesla, noting the position of its tires on August 27.On September 3, the officer issued a citation to the Tesla for violating the 72-hour parking ordinance.On September 5, the Tesla was impounded and towed to teh Hollywood tow yard.On September 8, Celeste Rivas, the teen missing for the past year, was found dead inside the Tesla trunk, her body rotting and attracting flies.Chances are that her body was already there when the Tesla was ticketed. Private investigator Steve Fischer who is posting his findings of this highly sensational case on X shared a photo of the Tesla when it was cited for impounding. Showing the layer of dust on the vehicle, Fischer argued that Celeste's body had already been inside the car, and the car had not been touched for days.""This partially zoomed-in photo shows how much dirt was caked on the car and windshield.That kind of buildup takes time to accumulate. I believe this car was parked for a long time with her inside,"" Fischer posted.D4vd is out of the public view with all his shows canceled as he's being investigated for his girlfriend's death. There is no official confirmation on the nature of their relationship, but D4vd's friends confirmed that they thought Celeste was his girlfriend as they were staying together in a rented apartment in Hollywood Hills. Celeste was a minor and a missing person when she died, though D4vd's friends claimed they all thought Celeste was 19 years old. However, it can hardly serve as an excuse for D4vd, as they were aware that Celeste ran away from her home and that the missing complaint registered her as a teen.","D4vd's tesla gathered a layer of dust for days.

A year ago, the new Ford Mustang Mach-E GT had a sticker price around $55,000. A month ago, Jeff Craig, a retired realtor, bought a slightly used 2024 version for $33,000. In exchange for 12 months and 13,000 miles, Craig got a 22% discount. ""I really did want an electric vehicle and I never had any intention of buying new,"" he said.Pre-owned electric cars and trucks in America are now almost as cheap as used gas-powered vehicles, on average, and are selling even faster, according to Cox Automotive, a services and technology company. What's more, sales of used EVs this year through June increased by 34% over the year-earlier period, while the market for new EVs only ticked up a tad.Several factors are feeding the buzz around used EVs. There's evidence that EVs may prove to be more reliable over time than gas-powered machines. Without radiators, spark plugs or oil, they require little in the way of scheduled maintenance. EV batteries are proving to be more durable than expected and in the US they are generally covered under warranty for at least eight years or 100,000 miles.","Pre-owned electric cars and trucks in america are now almost as cheap as used gas-powered vehicles.

The story of Wen-Hsing Huang, a 25-year-old engineer working at Amazon, can bring closure to many struggling with the present H-1B chaos. As told to Business Insider, Huang's experience of working in the US, living a life depending on a visa, is of self-realization that the so-called American Dream is not staying in the US but to build something in the freedom of one's home country and yet reach an international customer base. For Huang, it's Taiwan, from where he studied to get a spot at the University of Illinois.""I arrived on an F-1 student visa in 2022, when there were mass tech layoffs at Meta, Twitter, and many other companies. Finding a summer internship was really difficult.

""The turning point came in April 2025, when there was a lot of news about F-1 students being deported. I didn't get selected in the H-1B lottery for the second time and felt very uncertain and insecure,"" he said.""For three years, every major decision had to be filtered through 'Will this affect my visa status?' rather than 'Is this what I actually want to do?' I couldn't test business ideas, take entrepreneurial risks, or even travel freely without worrying about reentry,"" he said.""Now, my plan is different. I'll keep working at Amazon a while longer, save money, and return to Taiwan to start my own business. With the internet, borders matter less. I can register a company in the US, serve a global customer base, and earn US-level income while enjoying Taiwan's lower cost of living and better healthcare,"" he said adding that he's grateful to America for his degree, bif tech experience, broadening his perspective and lessons in resilience.""But leaving means I can finally make decisions based on what I want to build rather than what my visa allows.

Working 9 to 5 is a way to make a living. But in Silicon Valley, amid the competitive artificial intelligence craze, grinding ""996"" is the way to get ahead. Or at least to signal to those around you that you're taking work seriously.The number combo refers to a work schedule - 9 am to 9 pm, six days a week - that has its origins in China's hard-charging tech scene. In 2021, a Chinese high court barred employers from compelling employees to work 72-hour weeks.California tech workers are from fixated on the approach - and have been posting about it nonstop in recent weeks on the social platform X and LinkedIn.Evidence of the trend is so far largely anecdotal: Some companies are noting their expectation for 70-hour-plus workweeks in job descriptions. Executives are said to be asking prospective hires if they are willing to work such schedules. And Ramp, a financial operations startup, noted in a blog post this month that it had observed a higher share of corporate credit card transactions in San Francisco on Saturdays for the first half of this year than in previous years, which it took to mean that people are working more on weekends.Though the term is relatively new in Silicon Valley, 996 is a ""high-octane version of something that has been around in the tech industry for a while,"" said Margaret O'Mara, a historian at the University of Washington and the author of ""The Code: Silicon Valley and the Remaking of America.""She said since the 1960s, when semiconductor companies were in fierce competition, many tech firms have had intense, hours-heavy work cultures - and have been ""California casual"" on the outside and ""old-fashioned workaholic"" on the inside.The idea of tech workers approaching their jobs with an intense, at times almost religious, devotion is ""part of the DNA of Silicon Valley culture,"" said Carolyn Chen, a sociologist at the University of California, Berkeley, and the author of ""Work Pray Code."" She also noted that a strain of ""heroic masculine culture"" in tech enforces the expectation that people should be working all the time.The hustle culture, O'Mara noted, may be out of reach for those with caregiving or other outside responsibilities - and it risks re-entrenching the dynamics of an already homogeneous industry.For those savvy and lucky enough to get in on a big idea early - and willing and able to work nonstop - the incentives are vast. The recent wave of staggering investments in AI means that down-the-line riches are all the more tantalising. At the same time, tech workers may be feeling more insecure now than in past, more flush eras of Silicon Valley, O'Mara noted.After a few turbulent years of layoffs, high interest rates and vacillating returns on big swings, the tech industry - once known for its cushy benefits - has tightened things up. Elon Musk's self-proclaimed ""extremely hard core"" approach is no longer out of step with the rest of the industry. Silicon Valley's ""hard tech"" era is here, and working crazy hours (or at least talking about working crazy hours) is part of the new norm.The Silicon Valley of 2020 and 2025 have ""a different set of priorities,"" O'Mara said.","In silicon valley, grinding ""996"" is the way to get ahead.

Who will be hurt by $100,000 visa fee? Foreign countries or US economy?







Economist Peter Schiff stoked a controversy on H-1B as he expressed his opinion that the hike in the visa fee would not stop tech companies from hiring foreigners. They will now hire foreigners for remote roles where they work outside of the US. If this happens, then the move does not really help Americans in preserving their jobs, but several social media users participated in the debate and opined that they are fine with the arrangement as long as migrants are not crowding the US.""One of the unintended consequences of Trump's $100K fee on H-1B visas is that companies will outsource the work outside of the U.S. Remote workers won't pay U.S. income taxes or spend their earnings in ways that benefit local landlords or other U.S. businesses and their workers,"" Schiff posted on X.""I don’t think MAGA racists would have any problem with the jobs being outsourced to India. They don’t really care about the jobs they know they lack the skills to get. Their problem is they don’t want non-white immigrants,"" one wrote.""We are fine with that. Let them stay remote in other countries. It is low level work most of the time.We prefer that they don’t come here and they don’t bring all of their H-4 visa family members also,"" another wrote.""They could have before h1b, but they chose the pricier alternative of having them brought in. Most likely they'll pay to keep the best ones, jettison the rest, and replace them with domestic workers,"" a third user wrote.Many argued that offshoring is already an existing option for the companies and nothing stopped them from doing it. But still they chose to hire H-1Bs, bring in the foreign workers to the US and now that will become costlier.Economists have already sounded a warning that if the number of immigrants drops because of the visa fee, US economy will be hit because H-1Bs spend and invest their salary in the US economy, which increases consumer demand and new jobs.",Economist warned that us companies will now switch to outsourcing instead of applying for h-1b program.

Who will be eligible?

Why is the digital ID being introduced now?

Current identification methods



What’s next?







UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday unveiled plans to introduce a free digital ID system for all nationals and residents, aiming to curb illegal immigration and simplify access to government services, according to an official statement. .The government said the new digital ID, which will be stored on users’ smartphones, will streamline applications for services such as driving licences, childcare, welfare, and tax records. While individuals will not be required to carry or present the ID routinely, it will be “mandatory as a means of proving your right to work,” the statement added.Starmer explained the move will help prevent those without legal status from securing employment, thereby cutting off a key incentive for illegal migration. “This will stop those with no right to be here from being able to find work, curbing their prospect of earning money, one of the key 'pull factors' for people who come to the UK illegally,” the government said.Here is what you need to know about the government’s digital ID initiative:The new digital ID will be an app or digital credential stored on individuals’ smartphones. It will serve as a secure, government-backed proof of identity to access a range of services - from applying for driving licences and childcare benefits to accessing welfare and tax records.While the ID will not be compulsory to carry or show routinely, it will be mandatory to prove the right to work in the UK. This aims to prevent employers from hiring workers who lack legal permission to work, thereby reducing illegal employment.Starmer described the digital ID as an “enormous opportunity for the UK” and said it will provide “countless benefits” to ordinary citizens while helping the government enforce immigration laws more effectively.The digital ID will be available to all UK nationals and legal residents, including foreign nationals living in the country. The government emphasised inclusivity, pledging that the system will accommodate those without smartphones, such as the elderly or homeless.Details on the application process will be shaped by a forthcoming public consultation planned for later this year. The government has promised to engage with groups who might face challenges using digital services, ensuring the system is user-friendly and accessible to all.The UK has traditionally resisted introducing national ID cards, with the Conservative government scrapping a previous voluntary identity card system in 2011 established under Tony Blair’s administration. However, the current government views digital ID as a modern solution to immigration and public service access challenges.Illegal immigration remains a politically sensitive issue, and Starmer faces pressure from within his own Labour Party to address it effectively ahead of the party’s annual conference.Opposition voices have been critical. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said on social media that her party would “oppose any push… to impose mandatory ID cards on law-abiding citizens,” stressing that British people should not be forced into such a system.The Liberal Democrats also rejected the plan, arguing they ""cannot support a mandatory digital ID where people are forced to turn over their private data just to go about their daily lives.""Nigel Farage, leader of the hard-right Reform UK party - which polls predict could play a key role in the next government - voiced strong opposition, saying, ""I do not see a single benefit to the government having digital ID other than them controlling what we do, what we spend and where we go.""At present, UK citizens rely on passports, driving licences, and utility bills as forms of identification, depending on the situation. The digital ID aims to unify these disparate proofs into a single, streamlined digital identity.The government will soon launch a public consultation to gather feedback on the digital ID service, including from digitally excluded groups. Officials highlighted that lessons will be drawn from other countries with similar systems to ensure accessibility and privacy protections.(With inputs from agencies)","Uk prime minister keir starmer on friday unveiled plans to introduce a free digital id system for all nationals and residents.

What's behind move

'Rat people': What people are posting

How government is responding

What experts say





China on Monday said it is censoring 'negative' content online, adding to decades of surveillance and blocking of criticism against the Communist Party.Cyberspace administration of China announced a two-month campaign targeting content on social media, short-video apps, and live-streaming platforms, which are “maliciously misinterpret social phenomena, selectively exaggerates negative cases, and use them as an opportunity to promote nihilistic or otherwise negative worldviews. ”State-run media praised the campaign as a necessary step to restore order online, warning that negative content can cause panic and damage public trust.“The harm of such maliciously divisive content is significant. It can trigger collective misunderstandings and social panic, marginalise reason and facts, and even spark offline conflicts causing long-term damage to public order and social trust,” it wrote.The campaign comes at a time when China’s economic slowdown has hit young people the hardest. Growth in factory output and retail sales recently dropped to their lowest in months. Youth unemployment, excluding students, climbed to 18.9% in August, a two-year high.A long-running property crisis has weakened consumer confidence, reduced spending, and pushed youth unemployment higher.Many young Chinese have responded with lifestyles such as “lying flat,” a term that describes opting for a stress-free, simple life.Bloggers who shared this way of living online recently saw their accounts banned and videos deleted.New expressions of discontent continue to appear online, such as “rat people,” a trend where young people describe themselves as avoiding the outside world by staying in bed and relying on food delivery.Popular platforms like Weibo, Kuaishou and Xiaohongshu have also been punished for allowing “harmful” content, including celebrity gossip, to dominate trending lists.The regulator said it will also act against posts that spread fear, encourage hostility between groups, or promote “defeatist” ideas, such as “effort is useless.”It also warned against businesses that “sell anxiety” by exploiting people’s worries about jobs, education, or relationships.The regulator asked the public to “actively report such cases” in order to “stop the spread of negative sentiment.”Ja Ian Chong, a political science professor at the National University of Singapore, told CNN that many Chinese people feel pessimistic about their future.He said the government may be trying to boost confidence and spending by controlling public sentiment online. But he added that without real improvements in jobs and opportunities, changing online chatter may not change how people actually feel.“The state will try to clamp down on these new terms and expressions as they emerge, but they will simply continue to evolve,” Chong said.","China said it is censoring 'negative' content online, adding to decades of surveillance and blocking of criticism against the communist party.

UAE rolls out AI Platforms to boost Emirati employment and skills; What you need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-rolls-out-ai-platforms-to-boost-emirati-employment-and-skills-what-youneedtoknow/articleshow/124180514.cms,"UAE’s new AI Platforms aim to transform Emirati job market and close skills gaps

Massar Al Ghurair explained - AI job-matching, skills mapping and the partners behind it



Emirati Smart Human Resource Platform: A government pilot to streamline hiring and transparency

How the AI works and what that means for jobseekers

Policy, privacy and real-world outcomes

Faster matches, clearer training paths, and a test of governance





The UAE has recently introduced AI-driven platforms aimed at accelerating Emiratization and connecting Emirati jobseekers with training and work opportunities. Two headline moves are the Massar Al Ghurair platform (an AI job-matching and upskilling service launched by the Abdulla Al Ghurair Foundation) and the Emirati Smart Human Resource Platform (a pilot rolled out by the Emirati Human Resources Development Council). Together they use labour-market intelligence, personalized skill-profiles and employer dashboards to make hiring, training and candidate discovery faster and more targeted.Massar Al Ghurair is an AI-powered skills and career platform built to help young nationals discover career paths, identify skills gaps and receive tailored upskilling recommendations plus direct job matches with participating employers. It was publicly launched earlier in 2025 with a live demo at Expo City Dubai. The platform was developed with SkyHive (now part of Cornerstone) and lists partners that include Amazon Web Services (AWS), Strategy& Middle East and Inception (a G42 company). These partnerships supply the cloud, analytics and AI tooling behind the personalized recommendations.Public reporting on the program states it aims to support tens of thousands of learners and connect them with dozens of employers and training providers; figures cited during coverage include targets such as 45,000 learners, 50 employers and 20 training partners in the initial rollouts.Launched as a pilot in late September 2025, the Emirati Smart Human Resource Platform is designed to be an integrated recruitment and skills ecosystem for Emiratis: automated job recommendations, virtual interviews, interactive employer dashboards and real-time reporting on recruitment performance. The platform emphasizes transparency and governance in hiring and is intended to increase Emirati participation across strategic sectors. Unlike a single NGO or private platform, this government-backed tool aims to give regulators and employers a live view of candidate pipelines, responsiveness and sectoral gaps making it easier to coordinate training, quotas and incentives that support national workforce goals (including alignment with long-term strategies such as the UAE Centennial and national economic agendas).Both platforms share the same practical idea: turn raw CVs and course certificates into structured skill-profiles, then use labour-market data and AI to map those profiles to jobs and to recommended training. Practically this means a jobseeker can sign up, get a dynamic “skill passport,” see exactly which short courses or micro-credentials close a gap, and be surfaced to employers whose hiring criteria match their updated profile. Employers get dashboards showing candidate fit, time-to-hire and recruitment responsiveness useful for meeting Emiratisation targets.Quicker job discovery, personalized learning roadmaps, on-the-spot virtual interviews at job fairs, and clearer visibility on which skills local employers actually want. For employers, AI trims the search time and reduces mismatch by flagging candidates with the closest skill fit. Events such as Ru’ya Careers 2025 have already used advanced recruitment tools and on-site tech to connect Emiratis with thousands of roles, illustrating how these platforms will plug into existing hiring channels.If the platforms scale as planned they could materially speed up Emiratization by making training investments more targeted, reducing job-skills mismatch and helping small and large employers find suitable national candidates quickly. The combined NGO, private-sector and government approach also helps create a shared data backbone for workforce planning. AI recommendations are only as good as the data and assumptions behind them. Policymakers and platform teams will need to guard against biased matching, protect candidate data privacy, and ensure that automated shortlists don’t entrench new forms of exclusion. Coverage of related federal HR AI work shows the UAE is already moving fast on AI-driven HR tools but governance and transparency will determine public trust.The UAE’s new AI platforms are a pragmatic response to a well-known challenge: a fast-changing job market with new skills demanded each year. Massar Al Ghurair and the Emirati Smart Human Resource Platform together offer personalized guidance, employer connections and a data-driven way to scale Emiratization but their success will depend on how well they protect candidate data, avoid algorithmic bias, and convert AI leads into actual jobs and long-term career growth.",Uae’s new ai platforms aim to transform emirati job market and close skills gaps.

UAE market: pricing, trims and availability





Why it matters - buyer takeaways and the competition angle

Who should buy the 2025 Sportage?







The 2025 Kia Sportage arrives as a tech-forward compact SUV with a refined 2.5-litre petrol engine, a plug-in hybrid option, roomy interior comforts and a full slate of driver tech and it’s already available in the UAE with competitive pricing across trims. If you’re shopping the segment (CR-V, Tucson, RAV4), the Sportage now balances everyday usability with a proper PHEV option and strong in-car gadgetry.Kia’s petrol Sportage uses a 2.5-litre four-cylinder that produces 187 hp and 178 lb-ft of torque, paired to an 8-speed automatic and offered in FWD or AWD setups, a reliable, predictable package for daily driving and highway cruising. For buyers seeking efficiency and short electric runs, Kia offers a plug-in hybrid (PHEV) variant that combines a 1.6-litre turbo engine with a 13 kWh battery for a combined output around 261 hp and an EPA-estimated all-electric range near 34 miles on the PHEV model. That PHEV powertrain gives the Sportage sharper acceleration and a meaningful zero-emissions commute for shorter trips.The Sportage is widely available across UAE dealers and online listings, with pricing that varies by engine, drivetrain and trim. Local market guides and dealers show a broad band for the 2025 Sportage roughly AED 103,000 to AED 149,000 depending on trim and drivetrain, while average online listings put the market price near AED 114,000 for commonly offered configurations.Dealers in Dubai and other emirates already list new and used 2025 Sportage units, so test drives and immediate delivery options are common for popular trims.
