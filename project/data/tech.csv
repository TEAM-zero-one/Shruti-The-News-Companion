Power of Rs 10: Firms bet big on small packs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/power-of-rs-10-firms-bet-big-on-small-packs/articleshow/120268450.cms,"MUMBAI: This summer, consumer goods companies are turning up the heat on Rs 10 price packs-brands are pushing new products and variants within the price range into the market and also sharpening focus on distribution and marketing of smaller packs. Rasna for instance, has launched a fruit drink concentrate in Rs 10 sachet packs which can be used to make three glasses of beverage. The company's chairman Piruz Khambatta told TOI it will allow the lower middle-class an affordable alternative to other brands selling similar products at higher prices. Mother Dairy has widened its bouquet of Rs 10 packs by adding mango lassi and pudina chaach to the mix while PepsiCo has introduced a no-sugar beverage pack in Hyderabad at that price.While Rs 10 packs have always been key to companies' pricing strategy for India as it enables them to get more consumers within their fold in the value conscious market, the renewed bets on smaller packs also comes at a time when hit by high inflation over the past few quarters, middle class households have curtailed discretionary spending. Given that summers this time set in early in many parts of the country and projections indicating a scorching season ahead, companies want to tap into this opportunity to spur demand and the ploy here is pricing.""In terms of consumption, the environment remains mixed. Companies are trying to push smaller packs and drive more frequency. Also, after the launch of Campa, Rs 10 packs will somewhat make sure that companies remain competitive,"" said Karan Taurani, senior vice-president at Elara Capital.Dabur said that its portfolio of juices offered at Rs 10 will be a key distribution and market share driver for the company this summer. ""For beverages, the Rs 10 price point hits the sweet spot of affordability for Indian consumers, making it the preferred out-of-home consumption price point. This summer too, we will focus on offering more value for money to reduce the relative price differential with aerated beverages,"" said Monisha Prasher, marketing head, beverages at Dabur India. Mother Dairy has already seen a 30%-40% surge in demand for beverages, ice-creams and curd over last year, helped by an early onset of summer, said managing director Manish Bandlish. Rival Amul has stepped up competition in the market by launching Tru dairy-based fruit drink at Rs 10 for 150 ml.Coca-Cola's global CFO John Murphy who was on a visit to India earlier this year had said that the Rs 10 price point is very important in India and the company will focus on it. ""It's very important to understand the magic price points in a market like India and the Indian consumer is pretty elastic in what price point they are willing to buy or not,"" Murphy had said. Reliance's move to push Campa Cola in the market at a cheaper price of Rs 10 has nudged all brands to revisit their strategies.",Rasna has launched a fruit drink concentrate in rs 10 sachet packs which can be used to make three glasses of beverage.

No, it will take longer Yes, definitely

NEW DELHI: India is set to receive its first fifth-generation stealth fighter jet, the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA), by 2035, DRDO chairman Samir V Kamat said on Sunday.Acknowledging the long timelines typically associated with developing cutting-edge fighter jet programs, Kamat said, ""If you look at any programme anywhere in the world, it takes 10 to 15 years to develop a new platform. So we have started this journey only in 2024, when the CCS sanctioned the project. So it will take ten years and we have committed to deliver the platform by 2035…""""We want to start an AERO engine programme and we want to collaborate with a foreign OEM to cut down the risks of development. AERO engine technology is a very complex technology, however we have learnt a lot from Kaveri. Kaveri was a fourth generation engine and the current engine technology has moved to sixth generation, so we want to work with foreign OEM to reduce the risks as well as cut down the time for development. Hopefully, we will have some good news on this in the next few months..,"" he added.Talking about other crucial projects that are set to be completed in year, Kamat said, ""There are many projects which are now moving towards maturity. In the next six months to one year, you will see many of our systems getting inducted. VSHORAD, MPATGM, we have LCA Mark II, which will have its first flight, so there are many systems which are now moving towards maturity and in the next six months to one year you will see many of them getting inducted.""The comments came after the defence organisation, for the first time, demonstrated its ability to neutralize fixed-wing aircraft, missiles, and swarm drones using a 30-kilowatt laser-based weapon system.""This is just the beginning of the journey. The synergy that this lab has achieved with other DRDO labs, industry and academia, I am sure we will reach our destination soon... We are also working on other high energy systems like high energy microwaves, electromagnetic pulse. So we are working on a number of technologies that will give us Star Wars capability. What you saw today was one of the components of Star Wars technologies...,"" Kamat said.With this breakthrough, India has joined a select group of nations—such as the US, China, and Russia—that have successfully showcased similar advanced directed-energy capabilities.","India is set to receive its first fifth-generation stealth fighter jet, the advanced medium combat aircraft (amca), by 2035.

Seven months ago, Manisha Roy, 35, a resident of Hebbal, decided to replace her cook with a kitchen robot. She says she is better off now.Their dining out days have also reduced since the robot came. Her husband Naveen and their two-and-a-half-year-old daughter Nakshatra enjoy the robot-prepared poha, pav bhaji, and rice with rajma masala.“My kitchen robot can chop, sauté, fry, stir, steam and knead,” says Manisha. The automated device comes equipped with numerous pre-programmed recipes. Users need only follow the given directions, add the required ingredients and select the appropriate settings. The machine then handles the remaining process independently. Manisha operates the robot using a mobile app. The application shows instructions in sequence. ""I just add the ingredients shown on the panel, as per the pre-loaded recipe. I don't even have to be around while the robot performs the tasks, such as cutting vegetables or frying them,” she says.The robot allows her to multitask while cooking. “While cooking manually the traditional way, if you do other chores like folding clothes, the food may get burnt. Now I do other household chores while the food is getting ready, because I know my food won't be charred,"" she says.The difficulty of getting house-help, their increasing costs, and the hassle of managing them and their timings are pushing many households to look at alternatives. And automated devices and robots are proving to be almost transformative. These machines are taking over domestic tasks like floor cleaning, cooking and dishwashing.Meera Vasudev, a Bengaluru-based architect, uses two different kinds of robots for jhadoo pocha. “We also have a wireless vacuum cleaner. And I do the cooking by myself,” says Meera, who has been living without a maid for the last 18 months.One of the robots cleans surface dirt and can handle carpets. It navigates around clutter and under furniture, and returns to its charging dock when finished. However, Meera says, it struggles with thicker carpet varieties. The other robot performs floor mopping functions. It contains a water storage compartment that releases water while moving across the floor with an attached mopping cloth. However, it cannot remove stubborn stains.Wireless vacuum cleaners today are light and easy to operate. You don’t have to bend, like when you use a broom. They also pick up fine dust that a broom may not. Some come with a variety of attachments for use on different kinds of surfaces, including glass, blinds, carpets, and ceilings.Renuka Gurunathan, 43, from Koramangala, adopted automated cleaning solutions, including a dishwasher and a floor cleaning robot, during the pandemic period. “Not depending on an outsider for your daily life is truly a liberating experience,” she says.But she does employ occasional domestic assistance for thorough cleaning tasks a few times annually. “The practice of hiring professional cleaners for periodic deep cleaning, similar to the American approach, should be adopted more widely,” she says.For Manisha, her kitchen robot is proving to be more cost-effective than keeping a cook. “I was not happy with my house help,” says the postgraduate in bioscience who works as a research associate in Clarivate. “I used to pay her Rs 2,500 a month, but would end up doing a lot of the work myself. Now I’m saving a lot – up to Rs 9,000 a year,” she says. The cooking robot costs around Rs 40,000, but Manisha says it still makes financial sense to invest in it.She gets up at 7.30am, and does most of her cooking using the robot. “The robot makes cooking fun, faster and easier,” she says.Manisha also uses a multifunctional electric pressure cooker, which she finds particularly suitable for rice-based dishes, including biryani. ""The chicken biryani it makes is as flavourful and delicious as the authentic, restaurant-style biryani,"" she says, adding that it does not require much time, and “even a 10-year-old kid can operate it.”The new technologies are also changing traditional household dynamics, and breaking gender stereotypes. Smart appliances are encouraging men to lend a hand in household chores. Multiple people we spoke to said men often like to use these tech devices, including kitchen robots and wireless vacuum cleaners. Naveen, for instance, is passionate about technology, and the kitchen robot has stimulated in him a new interest in culinary activities. “He makes delicious meals using the robot and is thrilled with the results it produces,” Manisha says.We use a cooking robot. It’s more cost-effective than keeping a cook, and it has also helped in making my husband develop an interest in culinary activities. I manage sweeping and mopping mostly by myself. My husband chips in with cleaning from time to time. We also utilise a professional cleaning service for thorough bathroom maintenance, which costs Rs 500 per session.In our apartment complex, many are using robots for cleaning, but they have maids for other purposes like child care, dog walking.Robotic cooking appliances in India currently require human supervision and interaction. A genuine robotic system should operate independently after receiving instructions, completing tasks without requiring user intervention during the process. Floor cleaning robots , however, do a good job. I bought one during the Covid period, and find it quite satisfactory. It cleans better than a maid but its functionality is limited to horizontal surfaces. So you’d still need a maid for vertical surface cleaning and dusting. I’m hoping once my son becomes a teenager, I can do without maids.I’m a homemaker. I live with my in-laws, husband, and children. I bought a cooking robot in January. When I decided to replace my maid with a robot, my family was a bit apprehensive. But now they all like the meals made by the robot. It has also made life much easier for me. My elder daughter, Aaradhya, comes back home from school by noon. She loves the pulao prepared by the robot. It takes just an hour to make a good meal. After putting the ingredients into the robot, I keep moving here and there.I prefer robots to maids. They are way more reliable. They are easier to manage too. My cooking robot costs around Rs 40,000. It’s a one-time investment and it’s really worth it.Despite owning washing machines, many continue to have their domestic workers manually wash clothes by hand. While household appliances can handle cleaning tasks, domestic workers remain essential for numerous responsibilities. They are still indispensable for cooking and providing care for both young children and senior family members. I don’t look at technology as a deterrent.What I oppose is the non-regulation of domestic work and the exploitation of domestic workers through tech. Startups should look at creating algorithms that help workers with wage calculations and provide them salary slips.","Bengalureans are increasingly choosing to live without maids.

When Steve Jobs explained to President Barack Obama why iPhones can’t be made in the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/when-steve-jobs-explained-to-president-barack-obama-why-iphones-cant-be-made-in-the-us/articleshow/120246122.cms,"Poll Do you think shifting large-scale tech manufacturing to the US is practical? No, global supply chains make it difficult Yes, it's possible with the right support

Steve Jobs gives reasons why iPhones are made in other countries



US President Donald Trump has doubled down on his commitment to revitalising American manufacturing, proposing steep tariffs to push companies into producing goods domestically. This means challenges for tech giants like Apple, Dell and others who have huge manufacturing set-ups in China. Though over the past few years, Apple has moved some of its supply chain to countries like India and Vietnam; China still remains the biggest manufacturing base for the iPhone maker.The US President Trump sees tariffs as a way to drive manufacturing into the US, create jobs, and benefit the economy. And here getting the world's most valuable company, Apple, to manufacture its most popular product, the iPhone, in the US, is clearly part of Trump's vision. Last week, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters that Apple's commitment to invest $500 billion in the US over the next four years was supposedly a clear indicator that Apple believed it was feasible to build iPhones here. ""If Apple didn’t think the United States could do it, they probably wouldn’t have put up that big chunk of change,"" Leavitt said.However, manufacturing iPhones in the US may not be as easy. A case in point is a report by The New York Times dating back to 2012 that highlighted conversation between the then-President Barack Obama and some of Silicon Valley’s most influential leaders, including Apple CEO Steve Jobs , during a private dinner in California held in February 2011. This was just months ahead of Apple founder Steve Jobs’ demise in October 2011.Each guest – which included Eric Schmidt, then Google CEO as well as Mark Zuckerberg , the founder of Facebook – was encouraged to pose a question to the president. But when Apple’s late CEO, Steve Jobs, began to speak, it was Obama who asked a question: “What would it take to make iPhones in the United States?”Jobs’s response was blunt and unwavering: “Those jobs aren’t coming back,” he said, the report cited another guest at the dinner as saying.Notably, a vast majority of iPhones, iPads and other devices that Apple sold that year were assembled in China. The reasoning, according to Apple executives, goes far beyond cost-cutting. It’s about scale, speed and skill.According to the report, Apple’s executives believed that the company's stance wasn't solely about labor costs. According to dinner attendees, Apple's executives emphasised the superior scale, flexibility, and specialised skills found in overseas factories.Apple airlifts 600 tons of iPhones from India and transported them to ChinaAs President Trump's tariff push for domestic manufacturing intensified, Apple strategically moved to mitigate potential financial impacts. Just ahead of the tariff implementation, Apple expedited the transport of approximately 600 tons of iPhones, or an estimated 1.5 million units, from India via six cargo planes to avoid the impending levies.","Us president donald trump has doubled down on his commitment to revitalising american manufacturing.

Trump Administration Tariffs: Trump warns 'no one is off the hook' despite Lutnick's claim of electronics getting temporary tariff reprieve,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/trump-warns-no-one-is-off-the-hook-despite-lutnicks-claim-of-electronics-getting-temporary-tariff-reprieve/articleshow/120263957.cms,"File photo: US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick (left) and US President Donald Trump (Picture credit: AP)

US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick on Sunday said the Trump administration’s decision to temporarily exempt electronics like smartphones and laptops from steep new import tariffs was not permanent and that the products would soon fall under a new policy targeting the semiconductor sector.“They’re exempt from the reciprocal tariffs but they’re included in the semiconductor tariffs, which are coming in probably a month or two,” Lutnick told ABC’s ‘This Week’, making it clear the brief relief for consumer electronics was only a pause before a more targeted approach.The White House on Friday had excluded several electronics from the wide-ranging “reciprocal tariffs” introduced earlier this month, in a move that was expected to benefit tech giants like Apple, Samsung, and Nvidia. The exemption included devices such as smartphones, laptops, flat-panel monitors, hard drives, and chips, according to a US Customs and Border Protection bulletin.Semiconductor manufacturing machines were also spared from immediate levies.But just hours after Lutnick’s clarification, US President Donald Trump directly contradicted the idea of any exemption. In a post on Truth Social, he declared there was no tariff “exception” at all, saying the goods were merely being moved to a different category and would still face a 20% tariff.“Nobody is getting off the hook,” Trump wrote. “We will not be held hostage by other Countries, especially hostile trading Nations like China.”As per AFP, the White House now plans to launch a new wave of national security investigations aimed at the broader electronics and semiconductor supply chain, part of a push to reshore key industries. Lutnick reinforced that view, saying, “We need to have semiconductors… made in America. We can’t be reliant on Southeast Asia for all the things that operate for us.”The temporary reprieve comes as part of a confusing sequence of tariff changes by the Trump administration, with sharp reversals sparking uncertainty for companies and investors alike. Lutnick confirmed the administration was crafting a separate tariff model “in order to encourage” semiconductor and pharmaceutical manufacturing in the US.Some analysts saw Friday’s exemptions as a response to backlash over rising tech costs. According to AP, the administration’s sweeping tariffs had battered the market value of the tech industry's “Magnificent Seven” — including Apple, Microsoft, Nvidia, Tesla, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon, with a $2.1 trillion drop from April 2. That loss narrowed after Trump paused tariffs for countries outside China, but Friday’s contradictory messaging cast new doubts.China, meanwhile, has urged the US to drop the tariffs altogether. As per AFP, Beijing’s commerce ministry said the Friday exemption “represents a small step” and warned that the US should “completely cancel” its aggressive trade strategy.While Trump has promised to provide further details on Monday, officials have confirmed that China remains excluded from any wider tariff pause. According to AFP, there are no plans yet for talks between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping.Trump is expected to clarify the administration’s stance on electronics and semiconductors further on Monday.",Us commerce secretary howard lutnick on sunday said the trump administration’s decision to temporarily exempt electronics from steep new import tariffs was not permanent.

Chinese electronics component makers are offering price reductions of up to 5% to Indian companies as part of new sourcing contract negotiations, driven by concerns over the US trade conflict. US President Donald Trump has slapped a whopping 125% tariff on Chinese goods after China announced retaliatory tariffs.The US-China trade dispute has considerably reduced new orders to Chinese manufacturers, as global supply networks adjust to reciprocal tariffs, with the US imposing the highest rate of 125% on Chinese goods. The decreased American demand for Chinese electronics will also affect component requirements.The discounts being offered by Chinese companies are a substantial concession in an industry with slim 4-7% profit margins, according to an ET report. This could potentially allow Indian manufacturers to increase their profits by 2-3%, according to television, refrigerator and smartphone producers. Indian companies might transfer some cost benefits to customers to enhance sales.Chinese imports constitute approximately 75% of all electronics components used in Indian manufacturing.""Component manufacturers in China are under pressure,"" said Kamal Nandi, head of the appliance business at Godrej Enterprises Group. ""Prices will be renegotiated as export orders from the US slow down.""The electronics sector typically maintains raw material stocks for two to three months. Companies will initiate new orders from May-June onwards.

In 2024, electrical and electronic equipment represented the largest segment of US imports from China, amounting to $127.06 billion.Chinese suppliers are encountering reduced demand in India due to production-linked incentives, quality control orders (QCOs) requiring Bureau of Indian Standards approval for overseas sourcing, and increasing import duties on components, which have promoted local manufacturing. The India Cellular and Electronics Association projects domestic components and sub-assembly manufacturing to reach $145-155 billion by 2030, following the government's announcement of the Electronics Component Manufacturing Scheme on Tuesday. Currently, India imports essential electronic components including chips, compressors, inner grooved copper tubes, open cell television panels, printed circuit boards, battery cells, display modules, camera modules and flexible printed circuits.Also Read | 'I am not Sanjay of Mahabharata': RBI governor on where repo rate will head amidst Trump's tariff wars Dixon Technologies' managing director Atul Lall indicates that US market slowdown and reduced demand will result in lower component prices.

Marshmallows instead of eggs? Why Jet-Puffed’s Easter decorating kit is gaining buzz amid soaring egg prices,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/marshmallows-instead-of-eggs-why-jet-puffeds-easter-decorating-kit-is-gaining-buzz-amid-soaring-egg-prices/articleshow/120257795.cms,"AI generated image

With egg prices hitting record highs just ahead of Easter, some families — and even a few bunnies — may be looking for more affordable alternatives to keep the holiday tradition alive. One sweet solution? Marshmallows Priced around $2 a bag, marshmallows are emerging as a cost-friendly, dyeable substitute for eggs this season. Capitalizing on the trend, Kraft Heinz-owned Jet-Puffed has launched its first-ever “Dip and Decorate Dozen” kit — a pastel-themed marshmallow decorating set designed to bring Easter fun without the egg-spense, as reported CNN.In a press release, Jet-Puffed described the kit as a “festive, mess-free twist on egg decorating.” Priced at just $1.99, it includes six vibrant color packs, mini tongs for dipping, decorating pens, and a 24-ounce bag of extra-large marshmallows — roughly the same size as jumbo eggs. The kits are available exclusively on Walmart’s website and will be restocked daily ahead of the holiday.Jet-Puffed said the idea came in response to spiking egg prices, which have prompted many households to seek creative and budget-friendly alternatives.“Parents are looking for ways to keep the time-honored tradition alive without breaking the bank,” the company noted.According to the Consumer Price Index, retail egg prices jumped 5.6% last week to a record average of $6.23 per dozen — nearly 60% higher than a year ago. The rise follows an avian flu outbreak that killed about 30 million egg-laying hens this year.However, there may be signs of relief. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) reports that wholesale egg prices have dropped to around $3 a dozen, as the bird flu outbreak has largely been contained. Still, the USDA cautions that it may take several weeks for those lower prices to reach store shelves.Consumer demand for eggs has also declined, contributing to the dip in wholesale prices. “Demand from egg products manufacturers is mostly light as many have been able to take advantage of a sluggish carton market to build supplies,” the USDA report stated.",Kraft heinz-owned jet-puffed has launched its first-ever “dip and decorate dozen’ kit.
