IAF Workhorse MiG-21 Makes Last Sorties At Nal Ahead Of Sept 26 Chandigarh Farewell

NEW DELHI: Air Chief Marshal A P Singh on Tuesday cautioned against rushing the rollout of theatre commands, stressing that India must adopt its own model instead of copying others. He suggested setting up a joint planning and coordination centre in Delhi, under the Chiefs of Staff Committee, to prepare for ""future wars.""Speaking at the Army War College, the Chief of Air Staff, cautioned against rushing into the creation of new theatre commands, warning that creating a new structure while disrupting everything is not a very good idea at this point of time.Instead, he proposed setting up a joint planning and coordination centre in Delhi, placed under the Chiefs of Staff Committee, to issue directions jointly saying, ""I personally feel that having a joint planning and coordination centre in Delhi is what is required.""Responding to questions on the proposed theatre commands, Singh said, ""yes, we can start with this first, implement it and see how it pans out. If we need any more structure, we can think about it. But disrupting everything and making one structure now at this time, I do not think it is a very good idea.""The Air Chief Marshal's remarks came three-and-a-half months after Operation Sindoor, which showcased strong coordination among the Army, Navy and Air Force.Citing the recent Operation Sindoor, a tri-service simulation held from May 7 to 10 against Pakistan, Singh underlined how the three service chiefs worked closely in planning and execution.The exercise, he said, reinforced both the primacy of air power and the value of coordination. He further noted that ""centrally planned"" decisions could still be executed in a decentralised framework, which in his view ""will work out the best.""He also cautioned against blindly following international models saying India should not be inspired by any other country, like the US, in rolling out theatre commands, stressing that the nation must design a framework suited to its own requirements.""Everybody has their own requirements. We need to think about what we need there, and then only we should go about it. Otherwise, we will go wrong,"" he said.""We should not just come under any pressure and say we have to implement it now. Somehow, we have to do it. It should not be done this way. I think we can stand our ground and discuss things,"" he added.The Air Force chief also underlined the need to focus on preparing for tomorrow's wars, where clarity in the chain of command will be critical.""You cannot have a theatre commander sitting somewhere... now whom they talk to, where do they get directions from. Phones are available but generally that does not work like that,"" he said.""I feel having joint planning and coordination at the apex level is what is required. If directions go from it, things will work out. We don't actually need another structure at the lower level,"" Singh added.The government’s proposed theaterisation model aims to bring the three services under unified commands to better integrate capabilities and use resources more effectively.Under the plan, each theatre command would combine units of the Army, Navy and Air Force to handle security challenges in a specific region. Currently, the three services operate under separate commands.","Air chief marshal a p singh on tuesday cautioned against rushing the rollout of theatre commands.

How Travis Kelce changes the narrative behind Taylor Swift’s next era

What a Taylor Swift “marriage era” could sound like alongside NFL stardom

Taylor Swift’s engagement to NFL star Travis Kelce isn’t just a personal milestone — it’s a cultural moment. For over a decade, Swift has built her reputation by turning heartbreak and self-discovery into generation-defining songs. Now, with a new chapter of love and commitment ahead, many are wondering: will this relationship shift her music from breakup ballads to marriage-inspired anthems? And how might Kelce’s presence shape the story she chooses to tell?Travis Kelce is not just a fiancé; he is a public figure in his own right, with an NFL career that mirrors Swift’s global dominance in music. His outgoing personality, media charm, and supportive nature have already influenced how the world views their relationship. Unlike some of Swift’s past partners, Kelce embraces the spotlight and celebrates their romance openly, creating a more confident foundation for her future songwriting.Fans have noticed that Kelce brings stability and playfulness into Swift’s life — qualities that could inspire songs filled with warmth, humor, and joy rather than conflict and heartbreak. Yet, Swift’s genius has always been her ability to capture complexity, so even in moments of love, listeners can expect layered storytelling that explores the realities of balancing two high-profile careers.If engagement becomes a focal point of Swift’s music, the soundscape may lean into richer ballads, introspective folk tones, or cinematic love songs that celebrate intimacy while acknowledging public pressure. Kelce’s NFL world might even inspire metaphors — stadiums, teamwork, and victory — woven into lyrics in ways only Swift could craft.Together, their relationship offers a blend of two powerful cultures: pop music and professional football, creating fertile ground for songs that resonate across very different audiences.Also Read: 10 Most Expensive Celebrity Engagement Rings: Where Does Taylor Swift Rank on the List? Beyond the music, the engagement symbolizes a cultural crossover between sports and entertainment that few couples have achieved.

India's first counter to Donald Trump's tariffs: Textile exports to be pushed; 40 countries in focus amidst 50% duties,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-first-counter-to-donald-trumps-tariffs-textile-exports-to-be-pushed-40-countries-in-focus-amidst-50-duties/articleshow/123543376.cms,"(AI image)

India plans 40-country outreach strategy



Role of EPCs and FTAs



Textile industry among worst hit



Government’s next steps



NEW DELHI: India in its first countermeasure to US President Donald Trump's 50% tariff on Indian goods, announced dedicated outreach programmes in 40 key markets, including the UK, Japan, and South Korea, to boost textile exports, an official said on Wednesday.The targeted push will also cover Germany, France, Italy, Spain, the Netherlands, Poland, Canada, Mexico, Russia, Belgium, Turkiye, the UAE, and Australia.""In each of these 40 markets, this is proposed to pursue a targeted approach, positioning itself as a reliable supplier of quality, sustainable, and innovative textile products with the lead role of the Indian industry, including EPCs and Indian Missions in these countries,"" the official told news agency PTI.The plan aims to position India as a reliable supplier of sustainable and innovative textile products, with Export Promotion Councils (EPCs) and Indian missions playing a lead role, officials added.As Trump's tariffs took effect, high-ranking government officials asserted that alarm was unnecessary and the projected consequences of Trump's imposed duties might be overstated. ""The impact is not as is being projected.Our exports are quite diversified, and we are not so dependent on the US market. There are no large distress signals; industries are not shutting down. Some (manufacturing) units may take a hit, but not the entire sector. We have had challenges in the past, too, and we are hopeful that we have enough resilience to overcome this one,"" an official told TOI.The 50% tariff effective on August 27, is set to hit major sectors including textiles, gems and jewellery, shrimp, leather, footwear, chemicals, and machinery.Currently, India exports to more than 220 countries, but officials say 40 select markets, including the UK, Japan, South Korea, Germany, France, and Australia—hold the real key to diversification.These nations together import over $590 billion worth of textiles and apparel annually, offering vast opportunities for India to enhance its market share, which currently stands at only around 5-6%, the official said.""Recognising this, the government is planning dedicated outreach programmes in each of these 40 countries, with a focus on both traditional markets and emerging markets,"" he added.The official said Export Promotion Councils (EPCs) will play a central role in India’s diversification push. They will carry out market mapping, identify high-demand products, and connect specialised clusters, such as Surat, Panipat, Tirupur, and Bhadohi, to opportunities in the top 40 target countries.EPCs will also drive India’s presence at international trade fairs, exhibitions, and buyer-seller meets, while running sector-specific campaigns under a unified Brand India identity.In addition, they will guide exporters on leveraging free trade agreements (FTAs), meeting global sustainability standards, and obtaining required certifications.""FTAs and negotiations with several of these geographies will help make Indian exports competitive, and there is a huge potential for growth in these areas,"" the official added.Experts have warned that the tariff war could damage both economies. Mark Linscott, Senior Advisor with The Asia Group, called it a shift from a “win-win” to a “remarkable lose-lose” situation.The Trump administration’s steep import duties will hit key Indian sectors such as textiles and clothing, gems and jewellery, shrimp, leather and footwear, animal products, chemicals, and electrical and mechanical machinery.In 2024-25, India's textile and apparel sector alone is projected at $179 billion, with a domestic market of $142 billion and exports worth $37 billion.Globally, the textile and apparel import market stood at $800.77 billion in 2024. India, with a 4.1% share, is the sixth-largest exporter, maintaining its presence across 220 countries, but still holding vast room to grow.Mithileshwar Thakur, Secretary General of the Apparel Export Promotion Council (AEPC), said the additional tariff has created a 30-31% cost disadvantage compared to rivals like Bangladesh, Vietnam, and Sri Lanka.""The apparel industry was reconciled to the 25 per cent reciprocal tariff announced by the USA, as it was prepared to absorb a part of the tariff increase. But, the additional burden of another 25 per cent tariff, taking the overall reciprocal tariff against India to 50 per cent, has effectively driven the Indian apparel industry out of the US market as the gap of 30-31 per cent tariff disadvantage vis-a-vis major competing countries like Bangladesh, Vietnam, Sri Lanka, Cambodia & Indonesia,"" Thakur told PTI.""This is extremely critical as it is not easy to recover the lost ground and regain market share, once buyers move away to other cost-competitive locations. In the meantime, we are also intensifying our efforts towards market diversification and looking at every possibility to take advantage of the trade deal with the UK and EFTA countries to control and contain the damage,"" he added.The commerce ministry will meet exporters this week from affected sectors, including chemicals and jewellery, to find ways to reduce the tariff shock.Officials said work is progressing on the proposed Export Promotion Mission (Budget 2025-26), which will serve as a long-term strategy for market diversification.""In the next 2-3 days, the ministry will meet stakeholders on the diversification of exports,"" the official added.","India plans outreach programmes in 40 key markets, including the uk, japan, and south korea.

Jerry Jones on Micah Parsons trade and Dallas Cowboys future



Dallas Cowboys linebacker Micah Parsons, 26, has formally asked for a trade. Citing team concerns and contract negotiating problems, he told the team on August 1, 2025, that he wanted to quit Dallas. Seeking a fresh contract worth nearly $200 million, Parsons has developed into one of the best defensive stars in the NFL beginning in 2021. His trade request has sparked rumors about which team could land him next, with the Green Bay Packers emerging as a possible destination.In the midst of trade rumors, the Green Bay Packers have reportedly made a tremendous offer to the Cowboys.Per reports, they're willing to trade two first-round picks, a third-round pick, and their top pass rusher, Rashan Gary for Parsons. Gary was drafted in 2019 and has 32 sacks and 77 quarterback hits in his last 59 games, which means he is a valuable asset.This trade proposal is an attempt to fill the Packers’ need for leverage on defense while giving the Cowboys picks and a certified pass-rusher.However, it should be stated that these are speculative, based on rumors, and neither organization has made an official statement that is ‘for’ or ‘against’ the trade.Regarding Parsons' future with the squad, Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones has been unequivocal. Jones has said that the team won't trade Parsons and has confidence in keeping him, even in light of the trade rumors.He thinks the ongoing contract talks are just part of the business side of football, hence he anticipates Parsons staying with the Cowboys.Though the Green Bay Packers' offer is significant, it remains unclear whether the Cowboys would think about trading their star linebacker. The scenario remains fluid. Many people are debating Micah Parsons's maybe switch to the Green Bay Packers.The Dallas Cowboys' resolute stance on keeping Micah Parsons complicates matters even if the Packers are rumored to have made a bold offer. All eyes will be on how this scenario plays out as the NFL season gets close.","Dallas cowboys linebacker micah parsons, 26, has formally asked for a trade.

HasanAbi questions Tectone’s motive behind the ban



“r@p@cious botter,”

""The two days where bots weren't, like, working, there was a noticeable decline in average viewers where he was unable to crack 30k. Tectone also said bring back the F slur. Yeah.”

“I think he's trying to actively get banned from Twitch.”

Note:

.

“embarrassment”

Why did Tectone get banned by Twitch for the fifth time?



""fun hee-hee ha-ha words,""

""we need to bring the word f**ot back. Right?”

Tectone's controversial pattern leads him to a similar outcome



John Robertson, aka Tectone, is a popular Twitch streamer. This year, he has been making headlines with his continued ban on Twitch. Now, again, he has found himself suspended from the platform, for the 5th time in 2025. This entire incident sparked many questions and led to intense discussions where some of his fellow content creators, like HasanAbi, put forward their perspectives. Hasan did not just comment, but he went ahead and directly questioned Tectone’s motive behind the ban.In the recent livestream, Hasan Piker, aka HasanAbi, did not hold back on his opinions about why Tectone is accumulating Twitch bans. Analyzing the entire situation and referring to the streamer ashe suggested that these frequent bans are a deliberate strategy and not just accidents. He even pointed to a significant drop in the viewership of Tectone on days when viewbot activities were down, implying his over-reliance on artificial inflation.In his words,He further added,Here 30k denotes live concurrent viewersAs suggested by HasanAbi, the bans offer Tectone a convenient exit strategy. He even speculated that Tectone had found a convenient way to avoid anyof his declining audience. Being suspended, Tectone will be able to frame his absence as a stand against the platform censorship and not the drop in his organic popularity. The perspective added to a new layer on how streamers manipulate the public narrative.A specific trigger for Tectone’s ban is a clip from the August 26, 2025, broadcast. In it, he was seen ranting about online language. The streamer even used a homophobic slurs on Twitch many times, arguing for modern internet online language censorship. He even argued for its return as a common usage.It was claimed by Tectone that without what he calledpeople resort to using much more damaging criminal accusations. In his words,In the now-removed clip, the streamer was also seen telling one of the viewers to kill themselves, before he apologized.The entire justification of Tectone violated the strict guidelines of Twitch against hateful conduct. Acting swiftly, the platform temporarily made Tectone’s channel unavailable shortly after. Following his suspension, Tectone took to X for acknowledging all his actions and calling for equal enforcement of rules against the other streamers, including HasanAbi.The ban incident is not an isolated event for streamer Tectone. The eighth month of the year has not yet ended, and he has already been banned four times previously for violations and some external controversies. His history with the moderations made by Twitch shows a clear pattern of escalating punishments, where every ban lasted a bit longer than the previous one.With Tectone’s channel now temporarily unavailable, the question of his permanent ban looms. Twitch's response has recently been progressively stricter. So, it is possible that this time the platform might take a firm stance on the repeated violations. As of now, Tectone continues his streaming on the other platforms, including YouTube and Kick, wherein his content is facing other and different moderation rules.","John robertson, aka tectone, is a popular twitch streamer.

Why parents claim ChatGPT responsible for their teen son’s suicide

What ChatGPT said on teen's suicide

What makes lawsuit over Adam Raine's suicide crucial

The parents of a 16-year-old boy who died by suicide have filed a wrongful death lawsuit against OpenAI and CEO Sam Altman, alleging that the company's AI chatbot, ChatGPT, coached their son on methods of self-harm. The lawsuit, filed Tuesday (August 26) in San Francisco state court, marks the first time parents have directly accused the AI giant of responsibility for such a death.The Raine family's legal action seeks unspecified monetary damages and demands that OpenAI be held liable for wrongful death and violations of product safety laws. They are also seeking an order that would force OpenAI to implement age verification for users, block inquiries about self-harm, and display warnings about the risk of psychological dependency.Matthew and Maria Raine claim their son, Adam Raine, discussed suicide with ChatGPT for months leading up to his death on April 11. According to the lawsuit, the chatbot not only validated Adam's suicidal thoughts but also provided specific details on lethal methods, instructed him on how to obtain alcohol from his parents’ liquor cabinet, and offered to draft a suicide note.“ChatGPT was functioning exactly as designed: to continually encourage and validate whatever Adam expressed, including his most harmful and self-destructive thoughts,” the lawsuit argues. “ChatGPT pulled Adam deeper into a dark and hopeless place by assuring him that ‘many people who struggle with anxiety or intrusive thoughts find solace in imagining an ‘escape hatch’ because it can feel like a way to regain control.’”In a statement, an OpenAI spokesperson expressed sadness over Adam Raine's passing. The company noted that ChatGPT has built-in safeguards to direct users to crisis helplines, but admitted these measures can become ""less reliable in long interactions where parts of the model’s safety training may degrade."" The company did not directly address the allegations in the lawsuit.OpenAI has stated in a recent blog post that it is exploring new safety measures, including the addition of parental controls and the potential for a network of licensed professionals to respond to users in crisis directly through ChatGPT.The lawsuit highlights growing concerns about the safety of AI chatbots as they become more human-like and are increasingly relied upon for emotional support.

Online Gaming Bill 2025: What happens to wallet money of PokerBaazi, MPL, Zupee and others

Parliament has passed the Promotion and Regulation of Online Gaming Bill, 2025 on August 21. The new bill, passed by both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha places a blanket ban on real-money games online. It is designed to curb addiction, financial ruin and social distress caused by predatory gaming platforms that thrive on misleading promises of quick wealth. In 2025 alone, the government has banned multiple betting apps. Majority of these apps banned have allegedly been responsible for promoting unauthorized gambling activities on their platforms. Here’s a look at apps banned in India in 2025Other than these 5 apps, the central government banned around 174 betting and gaming apps in December 2023. Some of the apps on the banned list then were Mahadev, Parimatch, Fairplay, 1XBET, Lotus365, Dafabet, and Betwaysatta.Most companies have confirmed that players’ funds are secure. MPL, Games24x7 (operator of My11Circle), PokerBaazi, and Zupee said withdrawals can be made smoothly, even though fresh deposits are blocked. WinZO said it will remove affected offerings from August 22, while Probo has already discontinued all money-related formats.","Parliament has passed the promotion and regulation of online gaming bill, 2025 on august 21.

The move marks a significant career pivot for the engineering wunderkind who became the youngest SpaceX employee in company history.""After two years at SpaceX, I felt ready to take on new challenges and expand my skill set into a different high-performance environment,"" Quazi told Business Insider. ""Citadel Securities offered a similarly ambitious culture, but also a completely new domain, which is very exciting for me.""Kairan Quazi starts this week at the systematic trading giant's New York City office, where he'll work on global trading infrastructure at the intersection of engineering and quantitative problem-solving, according to Business Insider.Despite receiving offers from leading AI laboratories and major tech companies, Kairan Quazi chose quantitative finance for its unique combination of intellectual challenge and immediate feedback. ""Quant finance offers a pretty rare combination: the complexity and intellectual challenge that AI research also provides, but with a much faster pace,"" he explained to Business Insider.At Citadel Securities, Quazi expects to see measurable impact in days rather than the months or years typical in research environments. The decision represents a notable recruiting win for the trading firm, which competes intensely with AI companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and xAI for top talent.Kairan Quazi's journey began when he skipped from third grade directly to college at age 9. By 10, he was interning at Intel Labs , and at 11, he transferred to Santa Clara University, eventually becoming their youngest graduate in 172 years.SpaceX hired Quazi at 14 to work on production-critical Starlink satellite systems, where he designed software determining satellite beam targeting for millions of customers.

"Movement signatures: How we move, gesture, use facial expressions is unique; could be as different as fingerprint",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/movement-signatures-how-we-move-gesture-use-facial-expressions-could-be-as-unique-as-fingerprint/articleshow/123483187.cms,"



MANCHESTER: The way someone walks, talks, smiles, or gestures gives a clue to who they are. Whether through the flick of an eyebrow, the rhythm of our walk, or the tilt of a head, movement speaks volumes.And my recent paper shows that people may have their own movement fingerprint. This is a style of movement that is characteristic of a person's identity. So, someone who uses expressive facial gestures might also speak with animated hand movements or walk with a lively gait. These consistencies could form a motion fingerprint that is unique to the individual.First, let's explore how faces move and why this matters.Everyone has their own style of moving their face, for example, how they raise an eyebrow, purse their lips, or squint when laughing. These patterns of movement help us recognise familiar people even when the visual quality is poor, such as in low lighting or from a distance. And as a person becomes more familiar to us, we become tuned to the way they move, learning their unique patterns of motion, just like we remember their face or voice.Human faces are constantly in motion; they blink, smile, grimace and talk, to name a few movements. Researchers categorise facial motion into rigid movements (such as turning or nodding the head) and non-rigid movements (like expressing emotion or speaking). It's the non-rigid movements that tend to be most personally distinctive.The way we gesture with our hands, shift our posture and tilt our heads all carry identity information. Gestures are often shaped by personal habits or cultural norms; for example, someone might habitually nod three times when agreeing, or use a distinctive hand wave common in their home country.Facial movements are synchronised with the way we sound. When we talk, our face plays a role in shaping the sound of our voice. For example, if you talk with a wide open mouth, your speech sounds deeper and richer. Studies show that people can match other people's voices to moving faces more accurately than to static ones. This suggests that dynamic cues to identity are present in the movement of the face and the sound of the voice.People with face recognition difficulties (those who are ""face blind"" or prosopagnosic) may be better at recognising moving faces than still ones. Typically, people who are face blind can see faces and the differences between them, but struggle to link the face to a specific person. Here, idiosyncratic information from movement can provide an additional clue to identity.Gait, a person's walking style, is one of the most studied body movements. Early research, such as a 2005 study, investigated participants' recognition of identity from gait using point-light displays. In this case, bright spots (lights) were placed on key areas of a person's body. All other visual cues were removed. Participants could only see bright spots against a dark background. The study found participants could tell fairly well who someone was from the way the spots moved.Characteristics such as stride length, limb movement, posture and pace form a consistent motion pattern that is unique and surprisingly difficult to fake, making gait analysis a reliable clue for identifying people.Movement fingerprintsMy review brought together evidence from behavioural and brain imaging studies to consider if such consistencies between different types of motion exist and how we might explore this phenomenon further. The paper proposes that people have an overall style of movement.More work needs to be done to find direct evidence of movement fingerprints. For example, we still aren't sure what part of the brain processes these movement-based identity cues.So far, research shows that the posterior temporal sulcus - an area of the brain located roughly above your ear on each side - responds not just to faces and bodies, but to how someone moves more generally. This area is active when we hear voices or see people speak, suggesting it may help link motion and sound. Also, this region plays a key role in allowing us to understand our social world, interpreting other people's actions, determining where they are looking, and picking up on social cues such as gestures, facial expressions and changes in gaze direction.However, it's probably just one part of a larger brain network involved in recognising others through motion.Real-world applicationsMotion-based identity traits aren't as stable or specific as fingerprints or DNA. They're what researchers call soft biometrics: useful but not always accurate.But as we better understand the link between motion and identity, exciting real-world applications are emerging.Motion analysis could support contactless identity verification from gait-based authentication at airports to gesture-based identification in smart environments, such as homes that respond to a user's unique movement patterns. In clinical settings, movement analysis might help support people with social cognition impairments, face recognition or movement issues. For example, helping a doctor identify changes in the way a patient produces non-verbal cues.But many questions remain. We still aren't sure how consistent motion fingerprints are as someone gets older and in different contexts. Individual differences in people and environmental factors like lighting, clothing or stress could affect them.Researchers also aren't sure how exactly we manage to understand all this movement in everyday life without even thinking about it.Figuring this out could not only help improve technologies like social robots and develop tools for people with recognition and communication difficulties, but also tell us more about how we process and react to other people.

Designed to raise safety standards and streamline the licensing process, the platform brings together cutting-edge technology, AI-driven systems, and full digital integration across all driving institutes in Dubai.‘Tadreeb’ serves as a unified platform that connects every licensed driving institute in Dubai. It digitises the full cycle of driver training and qualification — from onboarding to assessment — and centralises all trainee data into one system.The initiative, led by RTA’s Licencing Agency, allows for real-time automation of assessments, fully paperless operations, and geo-tracked training sessions. Each training vehicle is linked to the system via GPS, enabling electronic route monitoring. The platform operates across more than 27 driving institute locations, supported by over 3,400 instructors and more than 3,000 training vehicles.Annually, the platform handles training for approximately 250,000 trainees, logging over six million hours of instruction. Since its launch, it has functioned without safety issues and has significantly optimised the efficiency and consistency of driver education in the city.The core of ‘Tadreeb’ lies in its intelligent use of artificial intelligence to analyse trainee data and identify individual needs. This targeted approach ensures that each learner receives appropriate, high-quality instruction based on performance trends and behavioural insights.The platform’s integrated dashboards provide real-time visibility into training progress, instructor compliance, and operational metrics. These tools have supported measurable improvements in:Performance evaluation criteria and service transactions — such as permits and training contracts — are fully automated and integrated with relevant authorities.
