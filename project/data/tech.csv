NEW DELHI: Government is looking at a technology-based solution to curb the growing menace of two-wheeler riders using mobile phone handsets while driving or performing stunts, which contribute to road crashes. The plan involves installing touch or pressure sensors on both handlebars of two-wheelers so that if the rider's hands are off the handle/s for more than 7-8 seconds, the vehicle would automatically begin to de-accelerate, forcing the person to ride properly.TOI has learned that the plan to use technology to correct rider behaviour was discussed at length at a meeting of transport ministry officials with vehicle manufacturers recently. Officials believe that such a mechanism could significantly reduce distracted riding, particularly the practice of holding a mobile phone in one hand while navigating traffic with the other, as well as performance of stunts.Many riders continue to flout basic safety norms despite penalties under the Motor Vehicles Act. ""If the vehicle itself can sense unsafe behaviour and respond, it will deter risky behaviour without requiring constant policing,"" said an official.Alongside handlebar sensors, manufacturers have been urged to explore the feasibility of providing leg guards on two-wheelers. This feature can reduce the severity of lower-limb injuries, which are among the most common in motorcycle crashes. While leg guards were more common in older models, modern two-wheelers do not have them.Government data shows there has been a steep rise in the number of two-wheeler deaths - from 69,385 in 2021 to 77,539 in 2023, nearly 45% of all road deaths. Two-wheeler riders top both as victims and cause of road fatalities. According to the road transport ministry's report, two-wheeler riders had the highest share of road deaths in 2023 while 48,181 people were killed in accidents caused by them.","The plan involves installing touch or pressure sensors on both handlebars of two-wheelers.

Living in a parasocial world: When your new 'best friend' is a popular stranger,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/living-in-a-parasocial-world-when-your-new-best-friend-is-a-popular-stranger/articleshow/125520076.cms,"Scroll, feel, repeat: How social media made parasocial love universal

parasocial

The performance of being real

'I screamed like my best friend got engaged': The Swiftie syndrome



It is a 'delicate' 'love story'.

When your hero wins, you win too

It's a messy love affair.

Concerts: When the screen comes alive

Ed Sheeran, Coldplay, Maroon 5 and Akon perform in India!

The expense of a parasocial.

The grief of losing someone who never knew you

The parasocial economy: When intimacy becomes a currency

We’re all parasocial

So is this good or bad?

The final truth

In 2025,became the Cambridge Dictionary’s Word of the Year — and honestly, could there be a more fitting choice? We now live in a world where emotional closeness is streamed, intimacy is performed, and connection is consumed in square tiles on our screens. The distance between us and the people we admire has collapsed so dramatically that for many, these aren’t public figures anymore — they feel like friends. Confidants. Extensions of ourselves.The word itself describes a one-sided emotional bond formed with someone we don’t know — a celebrity, influencer, streamer, or even a fictional character. But today, parasocial barely feels like an academic term. It feels like a daily lived reality.Instagram is no longer 'just an app'; it’s the new Netflix, feeding us episodic glimpses into people’s lives with cliffhangers, plot twists, soft-launches, and heartbreak arcs. Our idols aren’t just entertainers — they’re protagonists in a never-ending reality show, one we binge-watch with the devotion we once reserved for scripted television.Once upon a time, celebrity culture was mysterious, aspirational, placed firmly behind velvet ropes and PR filters.Today, the doors are flung open.Everyone — from A-list stars to teenagers with a ring light — is telling their story online.And the more people share, the closer we feel. Or at least, the closer we think we feel.Livestreams, photo dumps, notes-app confessions, 'get ready with me' videos, chaotic vlogs, 2am heartbreak stories, pilates classes, pet updates, skincare routines — the everyday has become theatrical. And we, the audience, become emotionally entangled in narratives that aren’t ours.You may never have met that influencer you check on every day. You may never have spoken to the actor whose divorce devastates you or the singer whose cryptic lyric you analyze for hidden truths. But our minds don’t always distinguish between real closeness and repeated, intimate exposure.The more we see someone, the more we feel we know them. The more they 'share,' the more we believe that access = intimacy.The parasocial world thrives on that illusionFor some, this bond becomes an identity.""I’m such a Swiftie that when Taylor announced her engagement, I screamed like my actual best friend was getting married. I’ve seen her fight for her music, reinvent whole eras, and drop breakup songs that can resurrect a dead party. Now my entire feed is nothing but Taylor easter eggs and Opalite reels. She has no idea I exist, but I’m emotionally invested like we’ve grown up together,"" said Priyanka Mukherjee, demonstrating peak parasocial bond.What’s fascinating is how common this feeling is — not embarrassing, not fringe, but culturally dominant. Entire communities are built around these shared emotional investments.Similarly, Shameen Alauddin has been invested in Nina Dobrev's life for almost 15 years now. ""Nina Dobrev is one of those celebrities who has quietly stayed in my life for almost 15 years. It’s like Dobrev became someone I rooted for without even realising it was happening; I am not tracking every little thing she does, but it is her personality that keeps me invested.""Celebrity culture used to be a conversation between fan magazines and fans. Now it’s a relationship. Or at least, the illusion of one.The parasocial bond isn’t limited to pop stars — athletes ignite it with equal intensity. Watching sports has always carried emotion, but in our hyper-connected world, fans often feel tied to players as if they were family.""The first full season I watched Messi glide through defenders, I truly believed magic exists and here was a man that made me believe in it. His biggest moments have felt personal: his departure from Barcelona felt like being uprooted from home, and his World Cup win gave me a joy so deep it still lives in my chest years later,"" said a starry-eyed Nakul Jain, who physically lives in Bengaluru, but believes he is Argentinian.""The way he carries himself, his humility and quiet strength, shapes how I move through life. And every time he wins, it feels like I win too… because fighting for him, loving him, and believing in him feels like defending a part of myself that still believes in magic,"" he added.This is the power of parasocial attachment — it’s not 'just fandom.' It becomes a mirror for our own emotional lives.Their battles feel like metaphors for ours. Their victories heal wounds we didn’t know were open. Their losses feel like personal tragedies.And then there’s the moment when the story you’ve been watching through a screen suddenly appears in 4K reality — concerts.There is nothing quite like standing in a stadium, surrounded by thousands of people who share your emotional vocabulary, waiting for the person whose voice has narrated your life. The lights dim. The first chords ring out. And suddenly, your parasocial relationship acquires a heartbeat.I attended a few concerts recently — Ed Sheeran, Coldplay, Maroon 5, Akon — and the experience was surreal. It was a collision of worlds: the digital, curated presence I had consumed for years and the embodied, breathing version standing right there on the stage.When Chris Martin broke into 'Fix You,' it felt like collective therapy.When Sheeran looped his guitar and built a song from scratch, it felt intimate, like he was doing it just for us.When Adam Levine swaggered across the stage, the entire stadium screamed like they had been waiting their whole lives for that exact moment.That’s the strange beauty of parasocial experiences — your idol doesn’t know your name, but you know their gestures, their smile, their stage banter, the exact way their voice cracks on that one high note. Seeing them in person felt like meeting someone familiar, someone whose existence has threaded through your memories. These concerts emptied my wallet but filled my heart. And that’s exactly what parasocial joy feels like — irrational, extravagant, but deeply, deeply human.Parasocial bonds don’t just give us joy — they give us grief.When beloved public figures die, the world mourns collectively, but privately too. It’s an ache that might feel disproportionate but isn’t. We grieve not just the person, but the era of ourselves they represented.When Satish Shah passed away recently — especially for fans of Sarabhai vs Sarabhai — it felt like losing a piece of our childhood living room. Indravardhan Sarabhai was more than a character; he was a personality stitched into our nostalgia, our humour, our shared pop culture shorthand.Matthew Perry’s death felt even more shattering. Chandler Bing was the friend in our living room for ten seasons, the voice in the background during college, the comfort show after breakups. The man behind that character battled demons we only understood later, and his passing felt heartbreakingly personal. Maggie Smith , whose characters shaped multiple generations — from Professor McGonagall to Violet Crawley — represented wisdom, wit, and authority. Her passing felt like the world losing a certain type of dignity.""I felt something similar when Liam Payne died. I slipped back into that old One Direction fan mode without planning it — rewatching performances, scrolling through timelines, trying to take in the news. It wasn’t about being attached to him as a person, but about the memories of my teenage self being a fan of that boy band. When one of them was suddenly gone, it made me realise that even when you don’t actively think of yourself as a ‘stan’, the version of you who once was can come rushing back,"" said Shameen.These people never knew us. But we knew them — or at least, a version of them. And the loss feels real because the relationships felt real.Influencers today aren’t just creators; they’re brands built on relatability. Their value comes from their ability to maintain the illusion that you are part of their inner circle.This means:- sharing personal struggles- opening up about mental health- soft-launching partners- crying on camera- revealing childhood traumas- letting viewers 'get ready' with them- inviting audiences to vote on their outfit, hairstyle, breakfast, life choicesIt’s intimacy as strategy. Vulnerability as content. Connection as a business model.Even though it’s designed, we still fall for it — because humans are wired for connection. If someone looks into a camera and talks like they’re talking to you, your brain often defaults to believing it.Why parasocial bonds feel so good — and so dangerousParasocial relationships give us:✔ comfort✔ consistency✔ emotional release✔ community✔ the illusion of stability✔ a safe escapeBut they also blur the lines between fantasy and reality. They also give us:- Expectation of emotional reciprocity- Comparisons of our lives to others’ curated narratives- Attachments based on edited glimpses- Guilt, jealousy, loyalty, and heartbreak over people we’ve never metIf we peel back the layers, parasocial attachment isn’t a glitch — it’s a feature of our era.And because everyone is online now — not just celebrities — parasocial dynamics exist between regular people too. We follow acquaintances, colleagues, strangers, creators, and micro-influencers and build internal impressions of their lives, personalities, and journeys without truly knowing them.We’re all characters in each other’s feeds. We’re all building one-sided familiarity with people who barely think of us. We’re all simultaneously the watchers and the watched.This is the new human condition — intimate yet lonely, connected yet curated, expressive yet isolated.Honestly — it’s both.Parasocial relationships can bring joy, inspiration, healing, motivation, creativity, and community. They can also bring heartbreak, comparison, obsession, and confusion.The key is awareness - to love the art without believing we own the artist, to enjoy the connection without mistaking it for a relationship, to cherish the comfort without collapsing into dependency, to admire someone without dissolving into their narrative.We may live in a parasocial world, but that’s not inherently tragic. It’s simply a new kind of human connection — born from the technology we created, shaped by the emotions we’ve always carried.Because at the end of the day, whether it’s Taylor, Messi, Ed Sheeran, Satish Shah, Matthew Perry, or Maggie Smith… parasocial love is still love. Real or imagined, it tells us something true about ourselves — what we value, what we long for, what we grieve, what we hope for. And maybe the most human thing of all is caring deeply about people who’ll never know our names.","We now live in a world where emotional closeness is streamed, intimacy is performed, and connection is consumed in square tiles on our screens.

More coverage on Cardi B and Stefon Diggs:

The placenta forms an extraordinary bond between mother and child, with the umbilical cord as their lifeline of silent conversation. When the baby arrives, the placenta follows, marking the end of this quiet connection. For nine months, mother and baby shared unspoken messages through this remarkable link, only to part with it at birth. But what if that connection could last a lifetime? That is probably the vision behind Mommy Made Encapsulation, a service that allows mothers to preserve their placenta forever. Such preservation was chosen by Cardi B , partner of New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs The couple recently welcomed a baby boy into their lives. Following the heartfelt tradition, she began with her third child, daughter Blossom, in October 2024, the Grammy-winning rapper chose to honor her fourth child with Diggs in November 2025 in a similar way. She entrusted Mommy Made Encapsulation to transform her pregnancy journey into cherished keepsakes, capturing the memorable moments when her baby was still growing inside her. The company crafted a heart-shaped gold pendant from the baby’s umbilical cord and turned the placenta into nourishing vitamins to support her post-partum recovery.Curious about how the gold pendant comes to life? The process begins with careful cleaning of the placenta, followed by a wash with blue dye that highlights its unique texture.After another rinse, the technician gently separates the placenta from the umbilical cord. The cord, now a striking blue, is shaped around a heart-shaped metal ring, with any extra length trimmed away. Finally, the piece is dipped in shimmering gold chrome, transforming it into a gleaming keepsake. The company describes it as a way to honor the first bond between mother and child. According to the company’s website, “The umbilical cord keepsake is your baby’s umbilical cord dehydrated in the shape of a heart and then dipped in gold chrome. The end result looks and feels like metal and is the perfect way to honor the first connection you shared with your baby.” It costs $50.The “AM I THE DRAMA?” creator took things a step further by having her placenta turned into vitamin capsules. That’s not all. She also tried something called a Placenta Print. The process starts with cleaning the placenta and dyeing it blue to look like a tree. Then, a sheet of paper is pressed on top to make the company’s signature Placenta Print, which costs $65. Their website explains that the print is made by painting the placenta with food-grade coloring (one gets to choose the colors) and stamping it onto a 12-by-18-inch poster to create a Tree of Life painting. After the print is made, the placenta receives a fresh rinse before its transformation into capsules begins.The website explains that the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) method is used, with careful steaming at 220 degrees F for 30 minutes to ensure safety. Bacteria and viruses cannot survive at temperatures higher than 131 degrees F. The placenta is gently steamed in specially designed steaming bags made up of heat-resistant, FDA-approved nylon, safe for cooking and free of BPA. Once steamed, the placenta is dried, ground into a fine powder, and sealed into capsules. Each placenta yields 160-180 pills, which, when taken regularly, can offer many benefits for new mothers, such as increased energy levels, balanced mood and hormone levels, and enhanced bonding experience with the baby. The capsules are available in a variety of flavors, including strawberry, orange, bubblegum, lime, berry, grape, and a vegan option. According to the website, these capsules never expire. They just need to be kept at room temperature and in a dry place. This never-heard-before ritual has even captured the curiosity of stars like Megan Fox and Vanessa Hudgens , who, like Cardi B, have embraced the trend of creating placenta keepsakes.",The grammy-winning rapper chose to honor her fourth child with stefon diggs in a similar way.

Cloud computing shift offers blueprint for Microsoft's AI transformation





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella fears repeating old mistakes





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella believes the company needs to completely rethink its business model for the artificial intelligence era, turning to an executive who influenced Microsoft's cloud computing transformation 15 years ago to help navigate what he describes as a critical platform shift that could determine the tech giant's survival. Nadella appointed Rolf Harms as an advisor on AI economics, the same executive whose 2010 white paper ""Economics of the Cloud"" helped force a cultural reckoning at Microsoft and paved the way for its cloud success. In an early November memo to top Microsoft executives obtained by Business Insider, Nadella wrote that the company needs to ""rapidly rethink the new economics of AI across the company — just as we once did with the cloud"".""This platform shift is all about building a new AI factory and family of Copilots and agents that drive diffusion and usage across the full stack,"" Nadella wrote in the memo. The move comes as AI companies face mounting questions over whether massive infrastructure investments will pay off. Microsoft took its foot off the AI spending pedal earlier this year, helping to stoke these concerns, though the company has recently doubled down through major new deals with OpenAI and Anthropic.Harms' 2010 white paper was considered a watershed moment in cloud computing, helping make the case for Microsoft's investments by showing why customers would eventually use large-scale cloud services to save money despite concerns about security and availability. At the time, people at Microsoft complained to Harms that he was ""throwing bombshells into their org,"" to which he responded: ""they're already there, I'm just helping you find them"".In a July 2025 letter to employees, Nadella acknowledged the ""uncertainty and seeming incongruence"" of thriving by objective measures while undergoing layoffs, calling it ""the enigma of success in an industry that has no franchise value"". He emphasized the need to meet changing customer needs by maintaining current business while creating new categories with new business models.The urgency reflects deeper concerns about Microsoft's long-term survival. At a September town hall, Nadella told employees he is ""haunted"" by Digital Equipment Corporation, which once ruled minicomputers but disappeared after making strategic errors. The Verge reported that Nadella warned ""some of the biggest businesses we've built might not be as relevant going forward"".Harms will continue reporting to Cloud + AI boss Scott Guthrie while working closely with Nadella and top executives, advising them on adapting to AI's new economics, from infrastructure to platform technology and applications. In his annual letter, Nadella reframed Microsoft's mission from building a ""software factory"" to becoming an ""intelligence engine"" that empowers everyone to create their own tools.Microsoft declined to comment when asked about the memo.Recently, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella revealed the company is shifting from charging ""per user"" to ""per agent"" as artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly perform autonomous work alongside human employees. Speaking on the ""Dwarkesh Podcast"", Nadella explained that Microsoft's business is transitioning from an end-user tools company to an infrastructure provider supporting AI agents that can complete tasks and make decisions independently. Nadella said: “Our business, which today is an end-user tools business, will become essentially an infrastructure business in support of agents doing work. The way to think about the per-user business is not just per user, it's per agent.”","Microsoft ceo satya nadella appointed rolf harms as an advisor on ai economics.

Elon Musk Becomes First Man To Have $500 Billion Wealth

Optimus: Elon Musk’s bold bet





Nvidia’s benchmark









Tesla CEO Elon Musk recently outlined what he feels will trigger dramatic revaluation of the electric vehicle marker stock, drawing parallels to chip manufacturer Nvidia’s meteoric rise. Replaying to the question of a user on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) Musk gave an answer on Telsa’s meteoric rise. A user on X recently asked the Tesla CEO that when will Tesla experience its own ‘Nvidia moment’. Replying to the user, Musk said that the company’s breakthrough moment will come with unsupervised self-driving at scale and, even more significantly, with the mass production of its Optimus humanoid robot.Elon Musk stressed on the fact that valuation of Tesla will witness a shift once its Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology achieves widespread deployment without any human intervention. He also defended Tesla’s relativity modest AI training spend. Musk noted that the company’s vehicles can generate vast amount of real-world driving data which is used to refine the system.Former Tesla AI chief Andrej Karpathy recently praised the FSD system, describing a drive in his HW4 Model X as “basically flawless” and likening it to riding a magnetic levitation train.Tesla CEO Elon Musk has repeatedly touted Optimus the humanoid robot. Musk believes that Optimus is Tesla’s future growth engine. He feels that Optimus will represent more than 80% of Tesla’s long-term value. Along with this, he also made some sweeping predictions about the potential of Optimus. Musk said that Optimus could:* Help countries like Japan address labor shortages* “Eliminate poverty” and enable universal income* Even serve as an “incredible surgeon”, providing advanced medical care universallyMusk has gone so far as to call Optimus an “infinite money glitch”, underscoring his belief in its transformative economic impact.The comments made by Musk comes at a time when Nvidia surpassed $5 trillion in market value overtaking both Apple and Microsoft. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has projected $500 billion in revenue, calling it unprecedented visibility for a technology company. Nvidia’s success has become a benchmark for investors seeking the next big AI-driven valuation surge.","Tesla ceo elon musk recently outlined what he feels will trigger dramatic revaluation of the electric vehicle marker stock.

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

Record earnings









Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has dismissed the growing concerns about an AI bubble. In recent months, investors and analysts have raised alarms about a potential AI bubble, warning that soaring spending by cloud providers and tech giants may prove unsustainable. Concerns have centered on whether the rapid build-out of AI infrastructure could mirror past boom-and-bust cycles in technology. Huang feels that the industry is presently undergoing some structural transformations and that it will sustain growth for the years to come. Speaking at the company’s earnings call, Huang said, “There’s been a lot of talk about an AI bubble. From our vantage point, we see something very different.” The remarks made by Huang in AI bubble were quite expected as his company is presently at the centre of the artificial intelligence boom. Almost all the major cloud service provider such as Google, Amazon, Oracle are Nvidia’s customers.During the earnings call, Huang also laid down three major transitions which are fueling the demand for Nvidia’s GPUs.- From CPUs to GPUs - Firstly, Huang talked about the slow down of Moore’s law.He said that traditional computing is built around central processors and it is reaching its limit. Industries ranging from data processing to search and ad recommendations are shifting toward GPU-powered systems, which are uniquely suited to handle the massive computational demands of AI.- AI as a creator of new applications - Secondly Huang feels that AI is not just improving the existing tools but it is now unlocking completely new categories of applications. From generative models reshaping search and recommendations to advanced engineering solutions, AI is becoming the foundation for innovations that didn’t exist before.- Rise of Agentic and Physical AI - Lastly, Huang pointed out that the next-generation AI systems are capable of reasoning, planning, and acting and require minimal human intervention. These “agentic” and “physical” AI applications, such as coding assistants and robotics, will require unprecedented levels of computing power, further driving demand for Nvidia’s architecture.Huang believes that Nvidia’s singular architecture supports all three transitions across every industry and modality of AI, making the company uniquely positioned to power this next wave of infrastructure growth.Nvidia reported a record quarter with $57 billion revenue which is up by 62% year-over-year, and forecasted $65 billion for the fourth quarter. The shares of the company rose by 5% in after-hours trading. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress reinforced the bullish outlook, noting, “The clouds are sold out. Our GPU installed base is fully utilized.”",Jensen huang’s talks about transformative shifts driving ai growth.

"Verizon layoffs: America’s largest telecom company to cut 13,000 jobs, what CEO Dan Schulman said in internal memo",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/verizon-layoffs-americas-largest-telecom-company-to-cut-13000-jobs-what-ceo-dan-schulman-said-in-internal-memo/articleshow/125465746.cms,"Verizon layoffs 2025

How this compares to Verizon's previous layoffs









: Verizon has announced it will eliminate more than 13,000 positions in what marks the largest single workforce reduction in the telecom company’s history, a report has said, adding that the job cuts come as the country’s largest wireless carrier struggles with competitive pressures and a shrinking customer base. CEO Dan Schulman, who took the helm in October after serving on Verizon’s board since 2018, cited the need to streamline operations and reduce costs that are limiting the company's ability to invest in customer value.“Our current cost structure limits our ability to invest significantly in our customer value proposition,"" Schulman wrote in an internal memo obtained by news agency Reuters. “We must simplify our operations to address the complexity and friction that slow us down and frustrate our customers”.The telecom giant plans to significantly reduce not only its direct workforce but also outsourced and external labour expenses, the report noted. Additionally, Verizon will convert 179 corporate-owned retail stores into franchised operations and close one location.Meanwhile, a company spokesperson told CNBC that the job cuts are “an opportunity for Verizon to reset, restructure and realign our priorities on ways that will help us regain our leadership as a communications provider.”This represents Verizon's largest-ever single job cut. The company had approximately 1,00,000 US employees at the end of 2024, including around 70,000 non-union workers. Over the previous three years, Verizon had already eliminated nearly 20,000 positions, making the current reduction particularly dramatic.Verizon is establishing a $20 million career transition fund specifically for laid-off workers, focusing on “opportunities and necessary skill sets as we enter the age of AI.” The company emphasised that the job cuts were not driven by AI implementation.Reports say that Verizon is facing competition from established rivals offering cheaper plans and cable operators entering the wireless market. The company added just 44,000 monthly bill-paying wireless subscribers in the third quarter, significantly trailing AT&T and far behind T-Mobile, which led the industry with over 1 million net subscriber additions.Schulman inherited substantial challenges from his predecessor at PayPal, arriving amid aggressive promotions from AT&T and T-Mobile surrounding new iPhone launches. Despite massive investments—including $52 billion for 5G spectrum in 2021, a $20 billion Frontier Communications acquisition, and $6 billion for TracFone Wireless—Verizon continues to lose ground in the competitive landscape.","Verizon announced it will eliminate more than 13,000 positions in what marks the largest single workforce reduction in the telecom company’s history.

Warren Buffett’s $4.3 billion Alphabet investment signals a direct challenge to Nvidia’s lead in AI chips,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/warren-buffetts-4-3-billion-alphabet-investment-signals-a-direct-challenge-to-nvidias-lead-in-ai-chips/articleshow/125506567.cms,"Google’s AI chips may be shifting the balance of power

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

A shifting competitive dynamic, but not a dethroning

Google trains and serves Gemini models on TPU infrastructure.

Google Cloud is offering Ironwood TPUs to customers as part of its cloud platform.

Companies such as Anthropic have announced plans to use up to one million Google TPUs, citing performance and cost considerations.

What Buffett’s investment likely signals

Implications for the AI chip race





When Berkshire Hathaway revealed a new multibillion-dollar stake in Alphabet, most observers initially viewed it as another major addition to Warren Buffett’s long-term portfolio. Yet the timing and strategic context suggest the investment could be more than a routine allocation. The world’s most influential value investor has chosen to back Alphabet at a moment when the company is strengthening its control over the hardware that underpins advanced AI systems.For nearly a decade, Alphabet has been developing its own artificial intelligence chips, known as Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). In November 2025, the company announced general availability of its seventh-generation Ironwood TPU, describing it as designed for demanding AI workloads, including large-scale model training and high-volume inference. This announcement was made publicly on Google Cloud’s official blog, where the company highlighted lower costs and improved performance for AI developers.Most AI labs still rely heavily on Nvidia’s high-performance GPUs.These GPUs remain the industry’s gold standard, but they are extremely expensive and often in short supply. This has created bottlenecks for AI companies that depend entirely on Nvidia for compute capacity.Google is in a unique position. By designing its own chips, running its own data centres and integrating its hardware into products such as Gemini and Google Cloud, Alphabet gains levels of efficiency that many competitors cannot match without years of hardware investment. Analysts and industry researchers have suggested that TPU-based training may offer meaningful cost advantages compared to traditional GPU-heavy infrastructure, although exact ratios vary and are not always publicly disclosed.Buffett’s investment therefore can be understood not as a claim that Alphabet has overtaken Nvidia, but as confidence in Alphabet’s vertically integrated approach to AI. By controlling more of the stack, Alphabet potentially insulates itself from the price swings, supply constraints and dependence that characterise the GPU market.Nvidia remains the clear leader in AI chips and maintains a robust ecosystem of developers, tools and software support. Google’s TPUs represent a serious alternative in some workloads, but not a full replacement for GPUs across all use cases.The publicly available evidence shows:These developments suggest that the AI compute market may become more competitive. However, they do not confirm that Nvidia’s dominance is definitively weakened. Instead, they indicate that Alphabet is emerging as a strong hardware contender in a market previously dominated by a single supplier.Berkshire Hathaway’s disclosed stake in Alphabet was valued at approximately US$4.3 billion at the time of the filing. The filing does not state Berkshire’s motives. However, investors and analysts widely agree that Buffett’s approval of such a large position indicates confidence in Alphabet’s long-term strategy, including its growing emphasis on efficient AI infrastructure.Buffett has consistently favoured companies with durable advantages or “moats.” Alphabet’s traditional moats have included Search, YouTube and Android. In the AI era, Google’s control over its own chip design and cloud hardware may represent an additional moat that differentiates it from rivals.This does not imply that Google is attempting to dismantle Nvidia’s leadership. Instead, it suggests that Alphabet is building the capability to operate more independently in an AI-driven future, and that this capability may strengthen its competitiveness in cloud computing and AI services.The next phase of AI is likely to be shaped by which companies can train and deploy models most efficiently. If Google Cloud attracts more third-party training due to cost, performance and availability, it could gradually shift cloud market dynamics. Nvidia will remain central to the ecosystem, but Google’s TPU ecosystem adds a new dimension to the competition.Buffett’s investment amplifies the narrative that companies with deeper control over hardware, software and data will hold significant advantages in the years ahead. Alphabet is signalling that it intends to be such a company.The takeaway is clear: this is not the end of Nvidia’s dominance, but it may be the beginning of a more competitive era in AI hardware.",Berkshire hathaway revealed a new multibillion-dollar stake in alphabet.

Google has officially launched Nano Banana Pro, a major upgrade to its widely popular AI image generator. Powered by the newly introduced Gemini 3 model, this latest version brings enhanced reasoning, improved world knowledge, and more accurate text rendering. The update reflects a significant advancement in Google’s AI ecosystem, building on the success of the earlier Nano Banana tool that became a viral sensation on social media. Users can now generate higher-resolution images, adjust lighting, focus, and camera angles, and integrate real-time information from Google Search. Nano Banana Pro also supports multilingual text and consistent character visualisation, making it ideal for professional creators. The rollout coincides with rapid momentum across Google’s AI products and strong user growth on Gemini-powered platforms.Nano Banana Pro is based on the Gemini 3 Pro architecture, offering stronger reasoning capabilities, improved world knowledge, and more precise text rendering. The announcement of Gemini 3 earlier this week also led to a noticeable increase in Alphabet’s stock, reflecting growing market interest in Google’s expanding AI technologies.Josh Woodward, Vice President at Google Labs and Gemini, shared with CNBC that the new version far surpasses the original Nano Banana release from August. Internal testers have leveraged the tool for tasks such as transforming code snippets and resumes into polished infographics. Woodward added that users are discovering innovative ways to visualise information that previously resisted visual representation.The first Nano Banana tool, built on Gemini 2.5 Flash, became a viral sensation on social media, with users creating hyperrealistic mini figurines. This original version brought millions of new sign-ups to the Gemini app within days, highlighting the public appetite for creative AI tools.One of the standout upgrades in Nano Banana Pro is its enhanced text generation capabilities. The tool can retain original text within images, create new text in diverse styles, and even translate content across multiple languages. These improvements are particularly useful for graphic designers, marketers, and content creators, who can now use AI to produce posters, mockups, and other marketing visuals with highly accurate text.Nano Banana Pro supports image generation at 2K and 4K resolution, a significant increase from the original model’s 1024×1024 output. Users can now adjust camera angles, lighting, depth of field, focus, and colour grading, giving professionals creative control similar to tools like MidJourney. These upgrades make it possible to generate images that meet professional standards for clarity, composition, and artistic effect.A new feature allows Nano Banana Pro to connect with Google Search, enabling images to be generated from live information. For example, users can generate visuals for a recipe, create educational flashcards, or produce graphics based on current data. This integration expands the tool’s versatility beyond static prompts, making it ideal for dynamic content creation.The Pro version can blend up to fourteen objects or use six high-fidelity photos in a single composition. It also maintains consistent appearances for up to five people, which is particularly useful for creating storyboards, presentations, or character sequences. This feature ensures visual continuity across projects, enhancing workflow efficiency for professional creators.Google is rolling out Nano Banana Pro through multiple channels:While Nano Banana Pro produces higher-quality images, Google notes that it is more resource-intensive and slower than the original Nano Banana.To ensure responsible use, Google is expanding SynthID, its AI watermarking system, across Nano Banana Pro. All images generated or edited include invisible identifiers, allowing users to verify whether a visual was created using Google AI and helping combat misinformation or misuse. Free and Pro-tier users will also see a visible sparkle watermark on generated images. Ultra subscribers have the option to remove visible watermarks, providing a clean canvas for professional projects, creative presentations, and other commercial or personal uses while maintaining accountability.Using Nano Banana Pro is straightforward:Free users are limited in the number of generations before the app switches back to the original Nano Banana model.The original Nano Banana runs on Gemini 2.5 Flash, while Nano Banana Pro is powered by Gemini 3. This gives the Pro version stronger reasoning, better world knowledge, and more accurate text rendering, enabling more complex and precise image generation.Original Nano Banana supports lower resolutions (around 1024×1024), whereas Pro can generate images at 2K and 4K. The Pro version also allows advanced adjustments like lighting, depth of field, focus, color grading, and camera angles, giving creators near-professional control.Pro has enhanced text handling, can retain or generate text in images, and supports multiple languages features limited or absent in the original.Nano Banana Pro can pull real-time information from Google Search to create dynamic visuals, while the original only works with static prompts.Pro can blend up to 14 objects or 6 high-fidelity photos and maintain consistent appearances for up to 5 characters, making it ideal for storyboards or presentations. The original lacks this level of compositional control.Pro includes SynthID AI watermarking for responsible use, visible sparkles for free/pro users, and optional removal for Ultra subscribers. The original had simpler watermarking or none.Pro is available on Gemini App, NotebookLM, Google Workspace, Search AI Mode, Flow, and via Gemini API, while the original was mainly limited to the Gemini App.Google’s Nano Banana Pro represents a major leap in AI image generation, combining the advanced reasoning of Gemini 3 with professional-grade visual tools. From higher-resolution images and multilingual text capabilities to real-time search integration and multi-image blending, the Pro version offers creators unprecedented flexibility. As the tool rolls out globally, it is poised to redefine the way professionals and enthusiasts alike generate and visualise content.","Google has officially launched nano banana pro, a major upgrade to its widely popular ai image generator.

Moody's warns that many US States showing recession signs





Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again issued one of his starkest warnings yet about the global economy. Bezos has urged the consumers and businesses to postpone their large purchases as the fear of recession is mounting. Speaking to CNN’s Chole Melas in an interview, Bezos has cautioned that the coming months could bring prolonged downturn. Bezos has recommend that households should consider putting a hold on purchasing big-ticket products such as cars, televisions and appliances. He urge the consumers to save that money as it will make a lot of difference if the economic worsens. Along with this, Bezos has also advised the small businesses to avoid large capital expenditures or acquisitions during this uncertain period.“Take some risk off the table,” Bezos said. “Just a little bit of risk reduction could make the difference.”Despite his cautionary advice, Bezos struck an optimistic tone about the long-term future, saying he believes the American Dream remains attainable. He even projected that within his lifetime, space travel could become broadly accessible to the public. Last month, Bezos tweeted a warning to “batten down the hatches,” advice he reiterated in his CNN interview as relevant to both consumers and business owners.Ironically, if the consumers follow Bezos’ advice, then it could mean lower sales for Amazon. Recently, Amazon announced its plans to layoff 14,000 employees. In October, Amazon projected holiday-quarter sales below Wall Street expectations, citing inflation and shifting consumer behavior. Americans are spending more on travel and dining out and less on discretionary goods.Recently, Mark Zandi, chief economist at credit rating agency Moody' warned about recession in the US. A new analysis of state-level data suggests that the US economy is ""on the edge of recession,"" said Mark Zandi of Moody's. ""Based on my assessment of various data, states making up nearly a third of US GDP are either in or at high risk of recession, another third are just holding steady, and the remaining third are growing,"" Zandi wrote on social media.The data reveals a mixed picture across the country. States in the South are generally the strongest, though their growth is beginning to slow. Meanwhile, some of the nation's largest economies, like California and New York, are described as ""holding their own,"" and their stability is seen as critical to preventing a full-blown national recession.However, many states are showing signs of vulnerability. Wyoming, Montana, Minnesota, Mississippi, Kansas, and Massachusetts were all identified as being at high risk of recession. The broader Washington, D.C. area is also notable for its economic struggles, which Zandi attributes to government job cuts.Adding to the forecast, Zandi predicts that the annual inflation rate, currently at 2.7%, could rise to nearly 4% within the next year, further eroding purchasing power for consumers.Along with this, Zandi also warned about the restrictive immigration policies which could hurt the tech sector. He urged the lawmakers to protect access to global talent especially in AI, software engineering, and data science. ""If it feels like we're coming to the end of the tariff increases, or like we're going to get a more rational immigration policy,' I think that would be a signal that the coast may be cleared,"" Zandi told BI.“It’s no mystery why the economy is struggling; blame increasing U.S. tariffs and highly restrictive immigration policy. The tariffs are cutting increasingly deeply into the profits of American companies and the purchasing power of American households. Fewer immigrant workers means a smaller economy,” added Zandi.","Bezos has urged the consumers and businesses to postpone their large purchases as the fear of recession is mounting.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

""How can a company with $13 billion in revenues make $1.4 trillion of spend commitments?""

""If you want to sell your shares, I'll find you a buyer. Enough,”

""Geeze, it sounds more like the judgmental valley conference.""





ChatGPT maker OpenAI was voted among the startups with potential to 'FAIL' in an informal survey at the Cerebral Valley AI Conference. The result offers an unexpected perspective on the ChatGPT maker that has $100-plus valuation. The survey asked founders and investors which AI startup they would be willing to bet against, a question not typically raised so openly in Silicon Valley. AI search startup Perplexity received the most votes, followed by ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. Meanwhile, when the audience was asked whether they could invest in any private technology company, most people voted for the Claude maker Anthropic, while OpenAI took second place.According to a Business Insider report, independent journalist Eric Newcomer conducted the survey by gathering responses from more than 300 attendees before panels featuring other major AI companies, such as Anthropic and xAI. This shows that some industry professionals are becoming more cautious about the success of AI startups. Even with a lot of money going into AI, there is now some doubt about how well certain big companies in the field will do.OpenAI taking second place on the list may seem unexpected because it is often viewed as a consumer-focused leader in the AI space. However, its rapidly rising valuation and significant infrastructure costs have raised concerns for some investors. Even though Sam Altman has acknowledged the possibility of an AI bubble, OpenAI CEO rejected the idea that his company’s valuation is overstated during a recent conversation with investor Brad Gerstner.Gerstner asked Altman at the interview.Altman replied.Altman noted that interest in the company remains strong. In fact, both OpenAI and Perplexity were popular choices in another part of the survey that asked which companies respondents would be willing to bet on.Perplexity, which also offers an AI-powered search browser, is aiming to compete with Google, and being ranked first on the list is not unexpected.Perplexity has become a typical example in discussions about the possibility of an AI bubble, as it has raised frequent funding rounds and attracted strong investor interest at valuations reported to range from $14 billion to $50 billion, according to the report.When asked about the Cerebral Valley survey, Perplexity spokesperson Jesse Dwyer responded in an email:However, it's important to note that any informal, anonymous survey should be viewed cautiously. Yet, the results offer insight into private opinions, as many founders and investors discuss concerns about an AI bubble but rarely mention specific companies.Unlike public markets, private investors do not typically bet against startups, and openly criticising a company without clear justification is generally discouraged in Silicon Valley.","Chatgpt maker openai was voted among the startups with potential to 'fail' in an informal survey at the cerebral valley ai conference.

Kash Patel’s Jet Scandal Erupts; $60M FBI Plane For Girlfriend’s Show? FBI Chief Slams Critics

Did Alexis create her X account when she was 8?





Kash Patel's girlfriend Alexis Wilkins shut down her trolls who claim her to be an Israeli asset by sharing a screenshot of her X account showing the location of the account. The account was created in 2009 in the US and is also based in the US. This is a new feature in X which the country music singer turned into a weapon to get to her trolls as she wrote: ""Greatest feature yet"". The three-word jibe was accompanied by a US flag.Many users claimed that it was not the original one as the original one would have 'Israel' written in the location. Alexis made sure that she called each and every such fake screenshot shared.""I hope that everyone sees, regardless of their specific reason, that the enemy is outside of the house. The people posing as Americans with big American opinions but are actually operating from a basement across the world have one common goal - to destroy the United States. We have our issues, but we really can’t allow them to succeed,"" Alexis wrote as X introduced the new feature showing where the users are based.Alexis sued Kyle Setraphin, Sam Parker and Elijah Schaffer -- all MAGA influencers -- for spreading the narrative that she is an Israeli spy and honeytrapped FBI director Kash Patel.The conspiracy theory started because of Alexis's association with PragerU as its CEO was in the Israeli Army. Both Alexis and her boyfriend, the FBI director, resisted these theories and now they are taking legal action against influencers propagating the theory.The controversy also took shape as people exclaimed over the huge age gap between Patel and Alexis and wondered how they could not actually be dating.Wilkins has proved to be a constant source of criticism for Patel but the FBI director stood strong and vowed to support her. Patel called her a true patriot, a partner and was also criticized for deploying elite SWAT team for her security in Nashville.As Kash Patel's girlfriend shared the screenshot with the details of her account, social media users pointed out that given her present official age of 26, she must have been eight years old in 2009 when her X account was created.Alexis said her parents made the account so that no one could take her name for anything malicious. ""Also in the new social media era, circa 2009, when your parents are up on tech and what’s coming out and the dangers of what social media could become (they were correct) they didn’t want someone else to take my username/name be used for something malicious if what I wanted to do, which was write a song to raise money for a charity when I was little. Ultimately my parents main goal has been to protect me without stomping on what I wanted to do in life,"" she said.",Kash patel's girlfriend alexis wilkins shuts down trolls who claim she is an israeli spy.

Oman is making history with the launch of its first-ever communications satellite, OmanSat-1, a major leap in national digital sovereignty and space capability. Developed in partnership with Airbus Defence and Space, the satellite will expand high-speed, secure communications across Oman and the wider region, strengthen critical infrastructure, and establish the foundation for a fully Omani-operated space program that advances technological expertise and the national space economy.The Ministry of Transport, Communications, and Information Technology (MTCIT) has officially signed a cooperation agreement with Airbus Defence and Space to design, manufacture, and launch OmanSat-1. The agreement was formalized between Engineer Saeed bin Hamoud al Maawali, Minister of MTCIT, and Alain Fauré, CEO of Airbus Space Systems.OmanSat-1 will be based on Airbus’ OneSat platform, featuring full digital flexibility that allows reconfiguration while in orbit. It will operate in the high-capacity Ka frequency band, covering Oman, including its economic waters, as well as regions across the Middle East, East Africa, and Asia.Alain Fauré emphasized that the satellite will provide Oman with world-class, fully flexible space communications capabilities and expressed commitment to working closely with the Omani space operator to build sovereign capabilities for future services.The Ministry has entrusted the execution and operational management of the project to Space Communications Technologies, a company owned by the Oman Investment Authority (OIA). The company will act as both the national operator after launch and the executive arm during the design and manufacturing phases.To ensure smooth coordination, a Project Management and Follow-up Office has been established within Space Communications Technologies. This office will oversee administrative and technical aspects, ensure readiness of the satellite’s operational infrastructure, and develop a comprehensive system to manage the satellite and deliver services to government and private institutions post-launch.Engineer Salem bin Saeed Al-Alawi, CEO of Space Communications Technologies, highlighted the importance of a fully Omani operational system. He stated that the company aims to manage the latest software-defined satellite, ensuring advanced and secure communications services for multiple sectors.Minister Al Maawali emphasized that OmanSat-1 will strengthen Oman’s digital sovereignty, allowing the country to provide secure and independent communications and data services. The satellite is expected to improve internet quality, expand coverage in rural areas, and ensure continuity of vital services across all circumstances.The project also focuses heavily on local capacity building. Intensive training programs will qualify Omani personnel in all stages of the project, from design and manufacturing to testing and operation. Local companies, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, will be integrated into the supply chain, supporting national added value and strengthening the private sector’s role in Oman’s space economy. Collaboration with universities is also planned to boost scientific research and development in partnership with Airbus Defence and Space.Dr. Ali bin Amer al Shidhani, Undersecretary of the Ministry and head of the Project Negotiation Team, described OmanSat-1 as a “qualitative leap” in the country’s technological and space capabilities, aligning with Oman’s commitment to a sustainable digital economy.Dr. Saud bin Humaid al Shuaili, chairman of the National Space Program, underlined that OmanSat-1 is a cornerstone of the National Space Policy (2023–2033), aimed at positioning Oman as a regional hub for space services. The satellite is expected to support economic diversification, expand the national space services sector, and contribute to the country’s GDP.The project integrates with multiple national initiatives, including:These initiatives collectively aim to create an integrated ecosystem supporting the development of Oman’s space economy.OmanSat-1 will expand national communications capacity and enhance digital services, particularly in remote or underserved areas. It will support critical sectors, including transport, logistics, emergency response, and cybersecurity, while enabling the adoption of emerging technologies such as the Internet of Things and advanced smart communications.The satellite aligns with Oman Vision 2040, which emphasizes innovation and advanced technology as central pillars in developing a diversified, knowledge-based economy. Once operational, OmanSat-1 will serve as a model for national expertise in space infrastructure and digital sovereignty, while opening new opportunities for economic growth and technological advancement.","Oman launched omansat-1, its first digital ka-band satellite, enhancing national communications, security, and technological sovereignty.
