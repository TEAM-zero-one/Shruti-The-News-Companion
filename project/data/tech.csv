The WhatsApp Scam That Gives Hackers Your Phone!

NEW DELHI: In just under three months, you will not be able to maintain your desktop/computer login on communication apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal and Snapchat for more than six hours at a stretch. You will have to re-login using the QR code provided by the app provider. Also, if you try to log into your communication apps on smartphones without the SIM card on which you first downloaded the app, it will not connect.This follows new orders issued by govt that say that communication apps should not allow connections on smartphones where the SIM card on which the user was originally identified is missing. The move is being taken to counter cyber fraud. Companies have to comply or face penalties. ""Failure to comply with these directions shall attract action under the Telecommunications Act, 2023 , the Telecom Cyber Security Rules, 2024 (as amended), and other applicable laws,"" govt said.The department of telecom said the current set-up was being misused by cyber fraudsters. ""... it has come to the notice of central govt that some of the app-based communication services that are utilizing mobile number for identification of its customers/users or for provisioning or delivery of services, allows users to consume their services without availability of the underlying Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) within the device in which app-based communication services is running,"" the department of telecom said, adding that the feature was posing a challenge to telecom cyber security ""as it is being misused from outside the country to commit cyber-frauds"".DoT said it had become necessary to issue the directions to prevent the misuse of telecommunication identifiers and to safeguard the integrity and security of the telecom ecosystem.DoT issued the orders on Nov 21. ""From 90 days of issue of these instructions, ensure that the app-based communication services are continuously linked to the SIM card (associated with mobile number used for identification of customers/users or for provisioning or delivery of services) installed in the device, making it impossible to use the app without that specific, active SIM,"" it said.On the web service on computers, it said, ""From 90 days of issue of these instructions, ensure the web service instance of the mobile app, if provided, shall be logged out periodically (not later than 6 hours) and allow the facility to the user to re-link the device using QR code.""It asked the companies to submit compliance reports within 120 days from the issue of the directions.","You will have to re-login using the qr code provided by the app provider.

What is overconsumption?



How brands and creators flatten taste



Insecurity: the quiet nudge



Trends move fast because satisfaction is the enemy of the algorithm; insecurity is its most reliable employee.

Fomo : engine behind overconsumption



Overpriced props: When utility takes a backseat



Social media’s role in impulse buying



Why this is a social issue



Environmental burden: Resource depletion, emissions from production and shipping, water usage, and eventual waste affect everyone, far beyond the buyer. Landfills grow, oceans fill with microplastics from synthetic textiles, and the carbon footprint of “ultrafast” fashion accelerates climate stress.

Inequality & exclusion : If you can’t keep up with constant trends, you risk being “left out.” This isn’t just a social media feeling — it affects real-world interactions, from workplaces to schools. The pressure to maintain an appearance of being “up-to-date” reinforces economic and social disparities.

When everyone copies the same aesthetic, individuality disappears. Local styles, cultural nuances, and personal experimentation are replaced with homogenized, algorithm-approved visuals. The result is a monoculture of taste, where creativity and cultural diversity are suppressed. Normalisation of waste: Impulse buying and disposability become habits. Owning fewer, better-curated items is no longer aspirational; chasing constant novelty is normalised.

Reclaiming individuality in a copy-paste world



High cost of looking the same



Step into a cafe, stroll across a college campus, wander through a mall corridor, or glance around an office floor — and one thing hits you: a uniform look. Clean-aesthetic tees, minimalist sneakers, matching water bottles, tote bags, neutral-toned gym outfits, skincare pouches, desk essentials — it’s as if everyone’s pulled straight from the same global wardrobe.But this sameness isn’t just fashion fatigue or convenience. It reflects a bigger shift — one where individuality is quietly fading, replaced by trend-driven conformity. Buying is no longer about what we need or genuinely like; it’s about belonging, insecurity, and feeding the endless scroll.Digital culture observer and content creator Oorjita Shahi, who commands a following of around 37k on social media and goes by @oorja.walking, has been closely tracking these patterns:“From a content creator perspective, when brands come to people, they have a set campaign idea and sometimes even provide scripts. Some people, especially those desperate for brand deals, might agree to say literally whatever the brand wants. Brands often use insecurity — especially in beauty — to sell products. They know making people feel anxious works. So people feel like they’re missing out,"" she said.Overconsumption isn’t just buying a lot. It’s buying more than you need, more than you use, and often more than you can responsibly discard.It means accumulating “stuff” — clothes, gadgets, accessories — at a pace far higher than your lifestyle actually requires.Often, these items aren’t bought for necessity. They’re aesthetic props: water bottles that photograph well, outfits that match a “feed vibe,” skincare kits that promise discipline, notebooks and planners that signal productivity, décor that “completes” a room.The consequences are real. The fashion and consumer goods industry is responsible for 8–10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Synthetic textiles release microplastics in washing cycles, and many clothes find themselves in landfills within a year. ( Scientific American Buying more than we need isn’t just personal indulgence — it’s a burden on resources, a generator of waste, and a contributor to climate stress.What once was local — shaped by culture, climate, and personal history — is now global. Brands and social media creators aren’t selling just products anymore; they’re selling a ready-made aesthetic.With global supply chains, social media marketing, product drops, and algorithm-driven trends, a look created in one place can spread everywhere in days. Platforms reward sameness: neutral clothes, minimalist rooms, curated routines. Follow the formula and you get visibility — and not just online. These aesthetics become social expectations in real life too, shaping how people dress, decorate, and present themselves.Consumers, then, are rarely buying a product — they’re buying a template for identity.The engine behind all this is insecurity. Marketing no longer sells utility; it sells reassurance. Posts, Stories, and videos on Instagram or TikTok cultivate longing: the feeling that maybe, just maybe, you’re not quite enough without this bag, this sneaker, this serum.Psychologists describe this phenomenon as Social Comparison Theory: People constantly evaluate themselves against others, measuring their lives, looks, and possessions. Social media feeds amplify this comparison, nudging users toward purchases that promise belonging, status, or social approval.Research confirms it. A 2021 study, Instagram Influencer Marketing: Perceived Social Media Marketing Activities and Online Impulse Buying, found that when influencers are attractive and trustworthy, users are significantly more likely to make impulse purchases. (First Monday)Fear of missing out — Fomo— is more than a buzzword; it has become a behavioural driver for many online shoppers. Social media platforms, armed with data on what catches your eye, deliberately create a sense of urgency. Limited-edition drops, countdown timers, trending hashtags, and influencer endorsements combine to make users feel that if they don’t act immediately, they’ll be left behind socially.The effect goes beyond a single purchase. Each “must-have” item comes with the invisible expectation of a next upgrade, a newer release, or a seasonal refresh. The fleeting satisfaction of acquiring a trending item is almost always replaced by the pressure to chase the next one. In this ecosystem, buying becomes less about fulfillment and more about keeping pace with the digital social hierarchy.Many of the products trending online are designed for perception rather than function.They promise visual appeal, social validation, or a lifestyle narrative, rather than practical value. A pastel water bottle may cost multiple times a standard reusable bottle, not because it performs better, but because it signals belonging to a curated aesthetic.Similarly, notebooks, planners, hoodies, and even niche skincare kits often survive solely on “vibe” — the sense that they complete a personal or social narrative. Once their novelty fades, these items frequently languish unused, join the pile of impulse buys, or end up discarded, contributing to environmental waste.Overconsumption, in this way, turns curated identity into disposable consumption, and the cost is measured not just in money, but in environmental and psychological tolls.Research backs this pattern. Instagram users exposed to trustworthy and relatable influencers are more likely to impulse-buy. ( First Monday, 2021 Another study, The Influence of Instagram Influencers on Impulse Buying Fashion Products ( Journal UNNES ), found that trust, similarity, and familiarity of influencers drive spontaneous purchases.Trend-driven fashion also carries an environmental cost, contributing roughly 8–10% of global greenhouse gas emissions. ( Scientific American Overconsumption isn’t just personal — it’s societal, with consequences that ripple far beyond individual choices.""I think influencers do have a big responsibility to discuss discourage overconsumption. Overconsumption is a big social issue. It's really important to have an approach where they make it very clear that this is just the product that I am marketing, I am not going to pretend like I use these hundred serums,"" said Oorjita when asked if she believes influencers have a responsibility to discourage overconsumption.Solutions begin small, but they matter. Resisting the scroll starts with pausing before buying, reflecting on whether an item is genuinely for you or just for your feed. Choosing with intention, prioritizing durability and personal style, buying fewer items but wearing them longer, and repairing instead of replacing are all ways to regain control.Supporting transparent creators who disclose sponsorships, choosing sustainable brands, reusing, recycling, and ultimately redefining identity beyond consumption all reinforce individuality.""A personality forms through your own understanding of yourself and being self aware about what you like and what you don't like about the world. If you are on social media for six, seven hours a day- you derive all your inspiration from social media and not from the people you meet in real life and the activities and the hobbies,"" Oorjita simply put it.In a world of mass-produced aesthetics and viral feeds, individuality is quietly disappearing — replaced by uniformity, impulse, waste, and dissatisfaction. Influencer culture, algorithmic virality, and brand-driven marketing don’t just sell products — they sell versions of identity, belonging, and acceptance, and belonging’s currency is constant consumption.But overconsumption isn’t just personal: it burdens the planet, erases diversity, and normalizes waste as lifestyle. Real resistance means choosing slowly, buying intentionally, and reclaiming identity from the scroll.Before your next purchase, ask: Is this for me — or for my feed? Because individuality was never meant to be mass-produced, and real style was never meant to be just trending.","Social media’s role in impulse buying is a social issue, says oorjita shahi. If you can’t keep up with constant trends, you risk being ‘left out’ social comparison, fomo, and influencer-driven ideals turn identity into a performance.

Airbus A320 Glitch: Ex-IAF Pilot Shows How ELAC 2 Fails In Real-Time Flight Simulation

NEW DELHI: Software rolled back, solar-storm threat neutralised. Indian operators of Airbus A320 jets - IndiGo Air India and Air India Express - finished reverting flight-control computers to a safer 2022 version in just over a day, heading off widespread groundings feared after the manufacturer raised red flags late Friday.DGCA was informed early Sunday that 323 aircraft had received the required ""downgrade"" to an earlier edition of the elevator and aileron computer (ELAC). Airbus had found that a later software upgrade could trigger sudden loss of control during intense solar storms - a failure linked to a US carrier's A320 that plunged abruptly on Oct 30, injuring 15 passengers.IndiGo completed the task across all 200 affected aircraft. Air India carried out the fix on 100 - nine jets were later assessed as not needing the rollback and four were already in base maintenance. AI Express finished updates on 23 of 25, with two under redelivery maintenance.Carriers escaped major disruption - only single-digit cancellations and delays of up to 90 minutes - thanks to IndiGo's young A320 fleet and the AI Group's limited number of older airframes. Older aircraft require hardware modifications alongside the software rollback, expanding task time.Globally, fallout was heavier. Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury apologised for the turmoil but insisted urgency was essential. ""The fix required on some A320 aircraft has been causing significant logistical challenges and delays... But we consider that nothing is more important than safety,"" he wrote on X, adding that Airbus teams were working ""around the clock"" to help airlines get aircraft flying again.",Indigo air india and air india express finished reverting flight-control computers to a safer 2022 version in just over a day.

Goodbye, Frequent FASTag Recharges! NHAI Launches Annual Pass for Rs 3,000

NEW DELHI: At least one in every five car users on tolled National Highway stretches is now using FASTag Annual Pass to pay the user fee. With an active user base of 36.3 lakh and around 20,000 new buyers being added daily, the scheme has become a runaway success in just three and a half months since its launch, data show.The FASTag Annual Pass, priced at Rs 3,000, allows private car owners to cross 200 toll plazas in a year, effectively bringing down the fee to just Rs 15 per plaza. It has emerged as the most convenient and cost-friendly payment option for inter-city commuters. Data from more than a dozen toll plazas show that over 40% of car users are paying the user fee through the annual pass.“At the national level, nearly 22% of toll transactions for cars are done using the annual pass. The newly operational Bijwasan toll plaza on the Dwarka Expressway in Delhi has the highest share, with more than 50% of such transactions. It is followed by the Mundka toll plaza in Delhi (48.2%) and the Jhinjholi plaza in Sonipat, Haryana, where the share is over 47%,” said a senior NHAI official.Data further show that on average around 13 lakh toll payment transactions occur through the annual pass each day.Officials said initial feedback from toll operators and commuters indicates that there have been hardly any instances of altercation or violence over the new system between commuters and user-fee collectors at plazas. They added that the increased adoption of the system has also significantly reduced queues at toll gates. “It has improved the operational efficiency of toll operators. We will soon carry out a comprehensive impact assessment of the scheme,” said a top official of IHMCL, a subsidiary of NHAI.","The fastag annual pass, priced at rs 3,000, allows private car owners to cross 200 toll plazas in a year.

H-1B Controversy Erupts After US Economist Alleges Industrial-Scale Fraud Targeting Indian Visas

BENGALURU: The top seven Indian IT firms received only 4,573 H-1B petitions approved for initial employment in FY 2025—a 70% decline from 2015 and 37% fewer than in 2024, according to the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP). The analysis, based on data from the USCIS H-1B Employer Data Hub, shows TCS is the only Indian IT services company among the top five employers securing approvals for new H-1B workers in the US.TCS is also the only Indian IT company in the top five for continuing-employment approvals, though its rejection rate for extensions increased to 7%, up from 4% in 2024, and significantly higher than its peers. Overall, USCIS recorded a 1.9% rejection rate for continuing-employment petitions. This year, TCS secured 5,293 approvals for continued employment. For initial employment, India's largest IT services company received 846 approvals, compared with 1,452 in 2024 and 1,174 in 2023, with a 2% rejection rate this year.The latest NFAP policy brief highlights a major shift in the H-1B landscape, with Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Google occupying the top four positions for new H-1B approvals for the first time.Only three India-based companies appear in the list of the top 25 employers for initial H-1B petitions.Petitions for continuing employment make up the bulk of H-1B filings, and rejection rates remain low for most major IT services firms. Infosys, Wipro, and LTIMindtree reported rejection rates between 1% and 2% for continuing-employment petitions. However, initial-employment denials rose sharply in FY 2025. Among larger employers, TCS posted one of the lowest rejection rates at 2%, while HCL America recorded 6%, LTIMindtree 5%, and Capgemini 4%. ""These trends indicate that companies are focusing more on keeping their existing employees legally employed. The H-1B program has become more of a holding pattern for workers in the green card queue rather than a mechanism to bring new skilled workers to the US,"" said Mansi Singh, Partner at law firm BTG Advaya.Immigration platform Beyond Border notes that approvals for individuals classified as ""software engineers"" during the labour certification stage have also been declining for four consecutive years, indicating reduced approvals not only in visa adjudication but in underlying labour assessments. According to H1BGrader, labour certifications for the ""software engineer"" category fell from 40,378 in 2022 to 23,922 through the third quarter of 2025. ""These rejection rates may reflect heightened, longer-term scrutiny of the H-1B program, particularly its use for software engineering and other technology roles, though current data does not conclusively establish direct causation,"" said Camila Façanha, Head of Legal at Beyond Border.Some policymakers who support restrictive immigration measures argue that foreign-born scientists and engineers constitute ""cheap labour"". However, USCIS data shows otherwise. In FY 2024, the average annual salary for H-1B professionals in computer-related occupations was $136,000, with a median of $125,000, underscoring that these workers are not low-cost hires. Additionally, 63% of approved H-1B beneficiaries held a master's degree or higher, indicating that the program continues to attract highly skilled professionals in demand in the US and globally.","The top seven indian it firms received only 4,573 h-1b petitions approved for initial employment in fy 2025.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff has declared that he will not use ChatGPT, the AI chatbot developed by Microsoft-backed AI company OpenAI . His comments came after he used Google’s latest AI model, Gemini 3.0, stating that a two-hour experience with Google’s new model has convinced him to switch permanently. Google CEO Sundar Pichai termed the Gemini 3 as the company’s “most intelligent model, that combines all of Gemini’s capabilities together so you can bring any idea to life. ”In a post on X, Benioff claimed that Gemini 3.0 has brought a monumental shift in the AI landscape. The CEO specifically praised Gemini 3’s performance across multiple modalities, noting key improvements in reasoning, speed, image quality, and video processing as the compelling factors behind his decision.“Holy shit. I’ve used ChatGPT every day for 3 years. Just spent 2 hours on Gemini 3. I’m not going back. The leap is insane — reasoning, speed, images, video… everything is sharper and faster. It feels like the world just changed, again. ❤️ 🤖”Benioff’s endorsement highlights the competitive pressure now facing OpenAI as models from rival tech giants like Google make significant advances. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and even OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman praised Pichai following the launch of Gemini 3.The xAI founder said “Congrats” on Pichai’s ""Geminiii"" announcement on X, and “Nice Work” to Demis Hassabis, the chief of DeepMind. Altman posted “Congrats to Google on Gemini 3! Looks like a great model.”Altman even noted potential “temporary economic headwinds” in an internal memo but expressed confidence in OpenAl’s rapid progress and leadership in the Al race.“We have built enough strength as a company to weather great models shipping elsewhere competition... (so), having most of our research team focused on really getting to superintelligence is critically important,” Altman wrote in the internal memo sent to employees.Stripe CEO Patrick Collison also posted on X that Gemini 3 built him an “interactive web page summarising 10 breakthroughs in genetics,” and called it “pretty cool.”Nvidia also responded to Google's stock rally, with a company stating 'We're delighted by Google's success—they've made great advances in AI, and we continue to supply them.' However, this diplomatic response came amid reports that Google's AI chips (TPUs) could potentially challenge Nvidia's market dominance, particularly after news emerged that Meta was in talks to purchase billions of dollars worth of Google's tensor processing units.

What Is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

Disruption will come from the unexpected





Take lessons from the dot-com era









Billionaire investor and Shark Tank judge Mark Cuban has now issued a warning to leading artificial intelligence companies including Perplexity, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft and Meta. Cuban has argued that all these companies are overspending in the race to build the world’s most powerful AI model. As reported by Business Insider, speaking in the Pioneers of AI podcast, Cuban compared today’s AI arms race to the search engine boom of 1990s. The search engine boom ultimately ended with Google dominating the market and leaving all the rivals behind.“You’ve got five, six, whatever it is, companies that are trying to create the ultimate foundational model that we all depend on,” Cuban said. “It’s almost like in the ’90s when all the search engines were competing pre-Google… Now, we know with search engines it’s Google, and then there’s Bing, as, like, 1 or 2% and DuckDuckGo has got a half a percent. So it’s effectively a winner-take-all.”Like many other world leaders and analysts, Cuban has also cautioned that the massive investments done on AI could ultimately lead to the creation of a bubble. “They may be overspending,” he said.“And if they overspend or get too caught up, the bubble is in the competition between all those models because that could pop just like that with any new technology.”Along with this, he also raised concerns about the infrastructure costs behind AI, majorly the massive and expensive data centers which are being built to power large models. “I just can’t imagine over a 10-year period that we aren’t going to improve the technology enough that if you overspend on today’s technology, it just doesn’t feel right to me,” Cuban added.Cuban also emphasised that the disruption AI will not come from incremental improvements but from something “incredible” that no one sees coming. “Somebody’s going to come up with some incredible shit, right?

They argue the pursuit of AI dominance is leading to increased emissions, water scarcity, and job displacement, urging leadership to prioritize ethical AI and environmental responsibility.

Amazon Launches Largest Layoff Drive Yet, Cutting 30,000 Corporate Positions to Boost Efficiency

Here's the complete open letter from Amazon 1000-plus employees:

Dear Andy Jassy and S-team,

In recent years, tech leaders have accelerated their race to build the most powerful AI first. “Sink or swim,” “AI is not going anywhere,” and “work with it or be replaced” have become mantras in workspaces at Amazon and beyond.

We, the undersigned Amazon employees, have serious concerns about this aggressive rollout during the global rise of authoritarianism and our most important years to reverse the climate crisis. We believe that the all-costs-justified, warp-speed approach to AI development will do staggering damage to democracy, to our jobs, and to the earth.

We’re the workers who develop, train, and use AI, so we have a responsibility to intervene. Here’s why we’re sounding the alarm:

Amazon is casting aside its climate goals to build AI. We have just a few years to stop disastrous levels of warming. Yet despite committing to net zero carbon emissions by 2040, Amazon’s annual emissions have grown roughly 35% since 2019. The AI race is widening this gap. The company plans to spend $150 billion building new data centers for AI. Many of these will be in drought-stressed regions, where they will consume scarce water, or in locations where their energy demands will force utility companies to keep coal plants online or build new gas plants. Amazon even killed legislation that would have required its data centers to use clean energy. Meanwhile, AWS is helping oil companies drill for more oil and gas.

Amazon is forcing us to use AI while investing in a future where it’s easier to discard us. Andy Jassy promised that soon Amazon will be full of AI tools and “agents,” and that he expects to employ fewer humans. He claims our (remaining) jobs will be “even more exciting and fun,” but here’s what we’re actually experiencing: higher expected output and shorter timelines, mandates to build AI tools for wasteful use cases, and massive investment in AI with little investment in career advancement. Our logistics coworkers have been especially impacted by work speedups, surveillance, injuries and burnout. All this, while Amazon is attempting to declare the National Labor Relations Board, which protects workers’ rights, unconstitutional.

Amazon is helping build a more militarized surveillance state with fewer protections for ordinary people. Amazon, alongside Meta, Microsoft and Google lobbied to ban state regulation on AI for the next ten years; Trump financially disincentivized state regulatory action in his AI Action Plan. Trump demanded an end to “wokeness” in AI; Amazon has scaled back its commitments to DEI and offered the administration a 1 billion dollar coupon for AWS, with a DOGE staffer calling the deal “a foundational piece to help implement President Trump’s AI Action Plan.” The military wants AI technologies at top speed; Amazon has announced a collaboration with an autonomous weapons software company. Trump’s ICE Director wants to run mass deportation “like Prime, but with human beings”; Amazon, a major provider of cloud services to DHS and to Palantir, literally does power mass deportation. Amazon is expanding the surveillance state in other ways, too. It’s making Ring AI-first and re-introducing a tool for police to request footage; it’s using AI to surveil warehouse workers, and, of course, its own customers. Finally, Jeff Bezos owns The Washington Post, and has begun asserting more control over that publication; the other major AI players control mass information ecosystems like Instagram and X. If these collaborations continue, we will be ceding an unbelievable amount of power into the hands of an increasingly authoritarian government and a few companies willing to abandon any principles they claim to have in the race for AI dominance.

All of this is daunting, but none of it is inevitable. A better future is still very much within reach, but it requires us to get real about the costs of AI and the guardrails we need.

We demand Amazon leadership commit to the following:

No AI with dirty energy.

No more vague promises that “AI will solve the climate crisis.” Amazon must implement a public plan that includes: 1) powering all data centers with 100% additional, local renewable energy, 24/7, 2) ending custom AI solutions for oil & gas companies to drill more oil faster, and 3) publishing a detailed, science-backed glidepath for how it will meet its climate commitments.

No AI without employee voices.

We want ethical AI working groups of non-managers across the company that will have significant ownership over org-level goals and how or if AI should be used in their orgs, how or if AI-related layoffs or headcount freezes are implemented, and how to mitigate or minimize the collateral effects of AI use, such as environmental impact.

No AI for violence, surveillance, or mass deportation.

Amazon sells a huge range of products and services — from physical goods to digital infrastructure to films to medical services. It should not need to be helping surveil civilians in Gaza, collaborating with AI companies that specialize in drone warfare, or supporting a mass deportation machine.

The Amazon employees signing this letter believe in building a better world — not in building bunkers to fall back to. We want the promised gains from AI to give everyone more freedom to play and rest, to spend time with family and friends, to be moved by nature, to create, to feel safe being who we are.

This is an incredibly consequential moment in history. It’s time for us to step up and spark a conversation about the real benefits and costs of AI. Workers have guided Amazon to a better path before, and we can do it again. The choices we make now, for the planet, for its people and animals, matter more than ever. Let’s make ones we can be proud of.

Signed,

1,039 Amazon employees (and counting!)





Thousands of Amazon employees have signed an open letter issuing some dire warnings about the company’s move toward AI. The letter, signed by more than 1,000 workers (and counting) calls out Amazon for pushing its AI investments at the expense of the climate and its human workforce. The letter’s supporters come from a wide array of roles at the company, including many software engineers, and even employees focused on building AI systems. ""We believe that the all-costs-justified, warp-speed approach to AI development will do staggering damage to democracy, to our jobs, and to the earth,” the letter’s authors wrote. It adds, “We’re the workers who develop, train, and use AI, so we have a responsibility to intervene.”The open letter is reportedly signed by Amazon workers anonymously, and comes almost a month after Amazon announced mass layoff plans as it increases adoption of AI in its operations. Among the signatories are employees in a range of positions, including engineers, product managers and warehouse associates. The letter argues that their employer is throwing out its climate promises in the scramble to win the AI race. Amazon has pledged to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, pointing to efficiencies from electric delivery vehicles and reduced plastic packaging in its climate commitment.","Over a thousand amazon employees have penned an open letter, warning that the company's rapid ai development is jeopardizing its climate commitments and human workforce.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has revealed his annual holiday reading list as the 2025 comes to a close. Gates has recommended five books and he believes that all these titles spark curiosity and reflection during the quieter days of the winter season. “Each of these books pulls back the curtain on how something important really works: how people find purpose later in life, how we should think about climate change, how creative industries evolve, how humans communicate,” wrote Gates.In the blog post, Gates has also explained that holidays are the perfect tome to slow down and also catch up on reading. “There’s something about the quieter days around the holidays that makes it easier to sit down with a good book,” he wrote. His list on 2025 book recommendations reflects on his fascination with how the world works and how you can start a great conversation.The book belongs to the fiction genre and its a story of an aging janitor and a wise octopus captive hime with its empathy and storytelling. “Van Pelt's story made me think about the challenge of filling the days after you stop working—and what communities can do to help older people find purpose,” said Gates.The books explains about the climate challenges. The book structures 50 big questions on climate change, nuclear power and renewables. “ I’ve followed Hannah’s work at Our World in Data for years, and her new book is one of the clearest explanations of the climate challenge I’ve read. She’s realistic about the risks but grounded in data that shows real progress,” said Gates.It is a memoir which recounts the Diller’s extraordinary career in Hollywood, media, and technology, blending personal anecdotes with reflections on power, risk-taking, and the evolution of entertainment and digital industries. “He’s spent his life betting on ideas before they were obvious, and the industries he’s transformed show how much those bets can pay off,” said Gates.The book explains about the mysteries of human behaviour and how people communicate. “Although the topic itself is pretty complicated, the book is readable and practical, and it made me see everyday social interactions in a new light,” added Gate.The books offers a glimpse of at why America seems to struggle to build things and what it will take to fix that. The book argues that progress depends not just on good ideas but on the systems that help ideas spread.",Microsoft co-founder bill gates has revealed his annual holiday reading list as the 2025 comes to a close.

How to clear Gmail storage and keep your inbox running smoothly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-tips/how-to-clear-gmail-storage-and-keep-your-inbox-running-smoothly/articleshow/125597081.cms,"Why does Gmail storage fill up faster than expected

Delete large emails and attachments

Remove newsletters and old promotional emails

Use the Google One Storage Manager to clear space across all services

Habits that prevent Gmail from filling up again

When you might need more storage

Running out of storage on Gmail can be stressful, especially when important emails start bouncing back or the service becomes slow. Many people do not realise how quickly storage fills up across connected Google services like Drive and Photos. Since Gmail shares its storage with the rest of the Google account, everything from attachments to uploaded files contributes to the limit. When the warning appears that storage is almost full, it can feel overwhelming. Fortunately, there are simple and practical steps that help clear space without spending money on upgrades. With a little organisation and a few smart habits, it is possible to reduce clutter and regain smooth performance in your inbox.Google provides an official Storage Manager that helps users see exactly what is taking up space across Gmail, Drive and Photos. The tool highlights large files, old emails with attachments and unnecessary items that can be deleted safely. It is the most reliable method since it works directly with data stored in the cloud rather than guessing what to remove.Gmail storage includes emails, sent items, drafts, attachments and everything stored in Google Drive and Google Photos. Even if the inbox does not appear full, large attachments or uploaded videos may be using most of the space.Promotional emails, newsletters, archived messages and old backups also count towards the total. Deleted items continue to occupy storage until they are permanently removed from Trash, which is why simply deleting emails does not always free space. When storage reaches its limit, Gmail stops receiving new mail and certain functions may not work correctly. Understanding what contributes to the total makes it easier to clean up effectively.When emails are deleted, they move to Trash and stay there for up to 30 days. They still count towards storage until the Trash is emptied. The same applies to the Spam folder. By opening each folder and selecting the option to permanently delete all items, users often free up space instantly.Attachments are usually the biggest contributors to storage use. Gmail provides search filters that help locate bulky messages. Searching for terms like has: attachment larger:10M displays emails with attachments larger than 10 megabytes. Once these are found, they can be deleted in bulk or downloaded elsewhere before deletion.Promotional categories often accumulate thousands of unread messages because newsletters, offers and automated campaigns pile up quickly without being noticed. These can be selected and removed together to clear storage space and improve inbox performance. If many emails come from the same sender, unsubscribing prevents future build-up and keeps incoming mail manageable by stopping unnecessary notifications permanently. Over time, this simple clean-up habit reduces digital clutter, improves focus and makes it easier to find important conversations without endless scrolling or searching.The Google One Storage Manager scans all the services linked to a Google account and lists files that consume the most space. It separates storage usage into sections such as large emails, deleted items, large files in Drive and backed-up photos or videos. This approach ensures that nothing is missed, especially when files outside Gmail are the primary cause of reduced space. Through a single interface, large items can be reviewed and removed safely without confusion.Regular maintenance avoids repeat storage problems. Clearing old attachments, emptying Trash frequently and reviewing large items every few months helps maintain free space. Avoiding the habit of emailing large files repeatedly can also help. Instead of attaching high-resolution photos and videos directly to emails, it is better to share links from Drive or alternative storage platforms. This allows senders to delete the original attachments without losing access to the files. Unsubscribing from mass mailing lists also helps maintain a clean inbox.For users dealing with intensive file exchange, such as designers, editors, photographers and students, the default free storage may not be enough. In such cases, upgrading to a paid Google One plan is a practical solution. Using two Google accounts is also an option, allowing heavier tasks to be separated from regular daily email.Clearing Gmail storage does not need to be complicated. With a structured approach and support from the official Google tools, anyone can free space quickly and enjoy uninterrupted messaging. Reducing unnecessary files keeps email performance fast, improves organisation and helps stay focused without clutter.A few minutes of clean up can restore full functionality and avoid the frustration of running out of space at the wrong moment. The best approach combines one-time clean-up with regular habits that prevent build-up in the future, keeping Gmail efficient and reliable.","Gmail storage fills up quickly, especially if large files are attached.

Years of hard work





Google CEO Sundar Pichai on AI layoffs









Google recently launched its most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3.0. Announcing the launch of Gemini 3.0, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that it is ‘the best model in the world for multimodal understanding’. Now weeks after the intense work on Gemini 3.0, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has acknowledged that his engineers are overdue for a break. As reported by Business Insider, speaking on the Google AI” Release Notes podcast, Pichai said “I think some folks need some sleep,” adding that hopefully he and his teams “get a bit of rest” now that the milestone launch is behind them.The comment made by Pichai comes as Google is moving towards a $4 trillion market cap as the stock price of the company has surged by nearly 70% this year, including a 12% jump following Gemini 3’s debut on November 18. The Gemini 3.0 model has been widely praised for its reasoning, speed and multimodal capabilities. Recently, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff also described the Gemini 3.0 model as an ‘insane’ leap forward. He also added that after using Gemini 3.0 for two hours he will not go back to ChatGPT.After the successful roll out of Gemini 3.0, Google has managed to reclaim its frontrunner position in the AI race. Pichai noted that years of hard work of the company is the sole reason behind this success.“In 2016, I wanted the whole company to be AI-first,” he said, pointing to milestones such as the creation of Google Brain in 2012, the acquisition of DeepMind in 2014, AlphaGo’s victory in Go, and the unveiling of Google’s own tensor processing units (TPUs), which were used to train Gemini.Pichai further talked about the Google’s strategy. Pichai explained that Google always worked towards a “full-stack” approach to innovation, improving everything from infrastructure to model training and test-time compute. He admitted that when generative AI first gained traction, Google was short on capacity and had to invest heavily to scale. “If you were on the outside, it would look like we were quiet, or we were behind, but we were putting all the building blocks in place, and then executing on top of it,” he said.Recently, Google CEO Sundar Pichai talked about AI layoffs. In a recent expansive interview with BBC, Sundar Pichai pushed back against concerns that AI could eventually lead to mass job cuts. Pichai said that the tech will eliminate some jobs but also “evolve and transition” others -- ramifications that mean ""people will need to adapt.""Pichai further added that AI may be gunning for his job, but he doesn’t seem too worried about it. AI is advancing so swiftly, he said, that over the next 12 months the tech will be able to perform “complex” tasks and act as an agent on a users' behalf. ""That’s where it gets really interesting,"" he said.",Google recently launched its most-advanced ai model — gemini 3.0.

The fear that one wrong step will wipe out years of saving. I don’t trust the system.

What the data quietly says

Zoom out, breathe easier

In the short term, ups and downs are routine.

Over 10–15 years, a diversified equity investment has usually rewarded patience.

The risk of doing “nothing”

Playing it too safe isn't safe at all

Meet Rajesh, the nervous first-timer

Some money in the bank, a couple of FDs.

Parents once bought a terrible product and lost money.

Rajesh has been “about to start an SIP” for three years, but every time he reads “markets at all-time high” or “crash coming”, he postpones it.

The safest path isn't always the straightest

First fix: protect yourself

Emergency fund Keep 3–6 months of expenses in a boring, easy-access place.

This is not for returns; it’s your “I can sleep at night” fund. Basic insurance Health insurance for hospital bills.

Term life insurance if others depend on your income.

Second fix: start small and boring

Start with an amount you can ignore emotionally. Even ₹2,000–₹3,000 a month is fine.

Use a simple, diversified fund—preferably a balanced / conservative hybrid if you’re very nervous, not a small-cap rocket.

Then let habit do the heavy lifting

Keep your emergency fund intact,

Pay your SIP on time, and

Not redeem every time there is a noisy headline, you’ve already done the hard part.

Increase your SIP as your income rises.

Gradually tilt more towards equity if your goals are 10–15 years away.

You don’t need courage. You need a plan.

Protect yourself from big shocks. Start with an amount and a product you can live with. Give time and compounding a chance to work.

If you’ve ever opened an investing app, seen a zig-zag line, felt your stomach drop and quietly closed it—congratulations, you are perfectly normal.You work hard for your money. You’ve heard horror stories about stock market losses, “this fund went down 20%,” and uncles who “lost everything” in some scheme. Then someone like me says, “Just start an SIP and think long term. ”Your brain reasonably replies: “Very nice. But what if I lose money?”Let’s separate feeling from fact.When people say “I’m scared of the market,” it’s usually a mix of:Scams, defaults, frauds—headline writers don’t go hungry.All fair worries. But the numbers tell a calmer story.Day-to-day, the market looks like a heart monitor. Over longer periods, it looks much more boring.The translation in plain English:There are no guarantees, but the risk of temporary loss is far higher than the risk of permanent loss—provided you behave sensibly.And then there is the villain we don’t see: inflation.Keeping all your money in savings and FDs feels safe. But “safe” here means “slowly losing purchasing power”.Not investing is also a decision about risk.Just not the one you think.Take a typical 32-year-old salaried worker in Delhi. Call him Rajesh.Even with a couple of bad years, the investing Rajesh ends up with a far larger corpus. The non-investing Rajesh feels safe but quietly loses opportunity.His fear of seeing temporary ups and downs is pushing him towards a permanent gap.If you’re genuinely scared of losing money, your first job is not to pick a mutual fund. It’s to make sure that one bad event doesn’t force you to sell at the worst time.Two simple steps:Once these are in place, the fear that “one illness / job loss will wipe me out” reduces sharply. You’re less likely to raid your investments in a panic.Your first investment should not try to impress you. It should try to survive you.During this period, do not stare at the NAV every day. Check once a quarter.

RIL reported an operationally in-line 2QFY26, with consolidated EBITDA up 5% QoQ to INR459b, led by a strong recovery in Retail and steady performance in RJio. Retail revenue grew 19% YoY, driven by festive demand, GST rationalization, and strong traction in quick commerce, while RJio added 8.3m subscribers with rising 5G engagement. O2C earnings improved 3% QoQ, supported by stronger fuel cracks and higher throughput.Management remains confident of sustained growth in Retail and RJio, supported by digital adoption, premiumization, and efficient execution. We estimate RIL’s consolidated EBITDA and PAT to grow at a CAGR of ~10–11% over FY25–28, driven by continued strength in consumer businesses and improving FCF generation. HCL Technologies delivered a strong 2QFY26, with revenue up 2.4% QoQ CC, ahead of estimates, and EBIT margin at 17.4%, supported by robust deal wins (TCV: USD 2.6b, +16% YoY). The company upgraded its Services growth guidance to 4–5% YoY CC, reaffirming steady execution.Growth was led by IT services and ER&D, aided by early traction in AI-led solutions, which now form ~3% of total revenue. Advanced AI platforms like AI Force and AI Factory are driving productivity and non-linear growth. We expect revenue/PAT CAGR of 5.3%/7.2% over FY25–27, supported by large-deal ramp-ups, AI adoption, and healthy client mining.While near-term margin pressures from wage hikes and furloughs persist, HCLT remains the fastest-growing large-cap IT firm with strong FCF generation and an all-weather portfolio.","According to motilal oswal financial services ltd, the top stock picks for the week (starting december 1, 2025) are reliance industries limited (ril), and hcl tech.

MeltIsLIVE’s high-speed crash reignites broader concerns about IRL streaming safety





In a shocking incident that left viewers stunned, Twitch streamer MeltIsLIVE survived a high-speed car crash that unfolded live on stream over the weekend. The clip, which has since exploded across social media, shows the streamer speeding down a Georgia highway late at night with multiple passengers in the vehicle. Moments before the impact, the car suddenly jerks out of control, and seconds later the stream violently shakes as the vehicle slams into another car and skids across the roadway. Panic immediately filled the chat as viewers watched the chaos unfold in real time.The incident took place Saturday near the Spring Street and Pine Street exits in Atlanta, an area known for heavy late-night traffic flow. Emergency services reportedly arrived quickly, though neither MeltIsLIVE nor Atlanta Police have released official updates about his condition. Footage suggests he was wearing a seatbelt at the time, which may have helped him avoid serious injury. As the clip continues to spread, fans have expressed both relief at his survival and deep concern over the dangers associated with livestreaming while driving at high speeds.The most pivotal moment of the crash came immediately after the loud impact, when the stream abruptly fell into a tense silence broken only by muffled noises inside the car.Thousands watching feared the worst as the camera captured the aftermath in near darkness. MeltIsLIVE later clarified that he had not been reading chat or using his phone, but many viewers and creators argue that livestreaming itself, especially during high-risk activities like speeding, is an unnecessary distraction.This is not MeltIsLIVE’s first streaming-related accident. In April 2024, he clipped another vehicle while driving distractedly, a moment that similarly sparked backlash online. Critics point out that the pursuit of adrenaline-filled IRL content has pushed some creators toward increasingly reckless behavior, often at the expense of their own safety and that of others on the road. Some community members are now calling for stricter platform penalties, including temporary or even permanent bans for driving-stream incidents.MeltIsLIVE’s survival has brought immense relief to fans, but the Atlanta crash serves as yet another cautionary moment for the broader streaming community. As IRL content continues to grow, both creators and platforms may need to rethink how far livestreaming should go, especially when lives are at stake. For now, viewers are simply grateful the streamer walked away from the terrifying wreck and hope it prompts meaningful changes in streamer safety expectations.Also Read: Twitch feud intensifies as Adin Ross targets Hasan in ban-appeal stunt","Twitch streamer meltislive survived a high-speed car crash that unfolded live on stream over the weekend.

A look back

Why the price fluctuation?





UAE motorists should prepare for a slight increase at the pump as the nation’s Fuel Price Committee announced an upward adjustment across all categories for December 2025. The new rates, which track global oil market movements, are officially in effect starting December 1, 2025. This increase reverses the marginal price dip enjoyed by consumers during November.Here are the new rates per litre, effective December 1, 2025, compared to November’s costs:The December price hike marks a return to higher figures following a welcome period of relief. In November, prices for all petrol and diesel grades had slightly declined from the higher figures seen in October, which saw Super 98 reach Dhs2.77.Throughout 2025, the highest pump prices were recorded in February (Super 98 hit Dhs2.74), while the lowest rates were enjoyed in April (Super 98 at Dhs2.57), highlighting the constant fluctuation driven by global market factors. The December rate of Dhs2.70 per litre for Super 98 places it back on par with prices seen in July and September.The monthly price change is a direct outcome of the UAE’s decision, enacted in August 2015, to liberalize fuel prices.Prior to this, fuel prices were heavily subsidized by the government, insulating consumers from the cost of global volatility.Now, the Fuel Price Committee rigorously tracks the average price of global crude oil and adjusts retail rates accordingly. This mechanism ensures that local prices reflect international market trends, including shifts in supply, demand, and geopolitical events that influence crude oil costs. Therefore, any move, whether up or down, is a direct signal of the previous month’s activity in the international oil sector.","Uae motorists should prepare for a slight increase at the pump as the nation’s fuel price committee announced an upward adjustment across all categories for december 2025.

"Ekman, who linked facial expressions to emotions, dies at 91",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/ekman-who-linked-facial-expressions-to-emotions-dies-at-91/articleshow/125649854.cms,"



Paul Ekman, a psychologist who linked thousands of facial expressions to the emotions they often subconsciously conveyed, and who used his research to advise FBI interrogators and screeners for the Transportation Security Administration as well as Hollywood animators, died Nov 17 at his home in San Francisco. He was 91.Ekman sought to add scientific exactitude to the human impulse to interpret how others feel through their facial expressions. He recorded 18 types of smiles, for example, distinguishing between a forced smile and a spontaneous one; a genuine smile, he discovered, crinkles the orbicularis oculi muscle - that is, it creates crow's feet around the eyes.Sometimes described as the world's most famous face reader, Ekman was influential in reshaping the way facial expressions were understood - as the product of evolution rather than environment - and his findings crossed over to popular culture.As a young researcher in the late 1960s, Ekman changed the scientific consensus on facial expressions. In the postwar era, the conventional wisdom of eminent anthropologists like Margaret Mead was that human facial expressions were learned and that they varied across cultures. Ekman believed otherwise. He showed photographs of people making faces expressing 30 different emotions - including anger, joy and fear - to subjects in the United States, Japan and South America.Across cultures, the study's participants linked the expressions they were shown with the same emotions.He then travelled to Papua New Guinea with a colleague, Wallace V Friesen, and showed the same pictures to some 300 Indigenous people who had no exposure to modern media and could not have learned to interpret faces that way. These subjects also connected the expressions to the same emotions.""There is a pan-cultural element in facial expressions of emotion,"" Ekman wrote in a paper in 1970 on returning to the United States.","Paul ekman, a psychologist who linked thousands of facial expressions to the emotions they often subconsciously conveyed, died nov 17 at his home in san francisco.
