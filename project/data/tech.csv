"Coming soon: No NOC for RC, insurance renewal without paying toll dues",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/coming-soon-no-noc-for-rc-insurance-renewal-without-paying-toll-dues/articleshow/122588200.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Those with pending toll dues for use of National Highways (NHs) will soon not be able to get a no-objection certificate (NOC) for renewal of registration and insurance, change of ownership, transfer and issuance of fitness certificate. The road transport ministry has issued a draft notification to introduce this change in Motor Vehicle Rules, to boost digital collection of toll fees and ensure that no one gets a free ride on tolled highways.The move gains further importance in light of the National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) going for multi lane free flow (MLFF) on NH stretches for tolling purposes, with there being no physical barrier to stop vehicles for collection of user fee.The draft notification proposes that the registration authorities “shall not grant request” for depositing motor vehicle tax or recording transfer of ownership in certificate of registration if “unpaid user fee” is reflected against the vehicle in question. The proposed change in rules also says that in case a vehicle crosses a tolling point after being electronically recorded but the toll charge is not paid, either because of the vehicle not having an affixed valid FASTag or on account of a pending challan, it will be reflected as unpaid user fee in the system.Officials said that vehicle owners would be allowed to avail the vehicle- and transport-related services only after they clear the toll dues.Earlier, NHAI had urged the road transport ministry to make changes in the Vahan system, which is the repository for all registered vehicles, to recover unpaid toll from vehicles with no FASTag or faulty/blacklisted tags.",The road transport ministry has issued a draft notification to introduce this change in motor vehicle rules.

CHENNAI: ASI director (National Mission on Monuments and Antiquities) Amarnath Ramakrishna was highly critical of the Centre and Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) for seeking changes in his 982-page Keeladi excavation report.In an interview to TOI, Ramakrishna, who retained NMMA but was relieved of ""Antiquity"", said, ""I can proof-read and correct spelling errors, but not the concept. If I change the concept, I become a criminal. If you ask for change in first-hand information, you are spoiling the moral value.""On Union culture minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat 's remark that the Keeladi report was neither scientifically sound nor technically corroborated, Ramakrishnaurged him to read the report first.

We have to enlighten people about it. They always talk about Indus Valley Civilisation, Vedic Civilisation, Maurya and Harshavardhana dynasties.

On ASI asking retired archaeologist P S Sriraman to submit his report on the third phase of excavation at Keeladi, Ramakrishna said, ""How can a person without any background of the site simply say there is nothing?""

What is moonlighting?

Soham Parekh, the Indian tech professional who became a lightning rod in the global startup ecosystem for simultaneously working full-time jobs at multiple companies, is once again in the public spotlight. Known for triggering widespread discussions around moonlighting ethics, work-life balance, and hustle culture, Parekh now claims that his life has remained “unchanged” following the controversy. In a recent post on social media platform X (formerly Twitter), he offered a candid glimpse into his current state of mind, mentioning his daily routine, mental health, and long-term goals, sparking renewed debate across tech circles. His remarks reflect deeper concerns about modern professional life, burnout, and ethical boundaries in remote work.Soham Parekh, a Mumbai-based software engineer, was publicly accused in 2023 of secretly holding full-time roles at multiple US-based startups. The accusations were led by the co-founder of Playground AI and former CEO of Mixpanel Suhail Doshi who alleged that Parekh was drawing salaries from as many as three to four companies simultaneously, some of which were Y Combinator-backed ventures, including Dynamo AI and Synthesia.Parekh later acknowledged these claims, stating in an interview that he was driven by financial distress, which compelled him to accept overlapping roles. He also revealed that he worked up to 140 hours per week, navigating tight deadlines, multiple meetings, and high-performance expectations. While some in the tech community were impressed by his time management and technical capabilities, the majority criticized his actions as unethical, especially because he failed to disclose his dual employment to employers.In his latest public post, Soham Parekh shared a screenshot of a message exchange where someone asked how he manages to work so much. He replied bluntly, “I love what I do. Lol. I don’t have anything else to do.” He added in a follow-up caption, “My life hasn’t changed one bit.”Though casual in tone, the statement quickly went viral, drawing strong reactions. The message struck a chord with many professionals navigating the high-pressure environments of startups, where identity and productivity often overlap. Parekh’s comments reignited discussion around the emotional toll of hustle culture, especially in sectors where overworking is normalized and sometimes even glorified.The moonlighting debate refers to the growing controversy around professionals taking on multiple jobs often simultaneously without informing their primary employer. While moonlighting traditionally meant holding a second job outside regular working hours, the rise of remote work and gig culture has blurred these boundaries, especially in tech and startup industries.At the center of the debate are ethical, legal, and productivity concerns. Some companies view undisclosed secondary employment as a breach of trust or a conflict of interest, especially when employees hold multiple full-time roles. Others, however, argue that moonlighting is a personal right—especially in economies where one job may not be financially sufficient.The moonlighting debate stems from a complex interplay of transparency, contractual obligations, performance expectations, economic realities, and evolving workplace norms. Employers emphasize transparency and trust, arguing that undisclosed secondary jobs raise concerns about divided attention, compromised performance, and potential misuse of confidential information. Employment contracts often explicitly prohibit outside work that might conflict with the company’s interests, further complicating the issue.Critics of moonlighting warn that juggling multiple demanding roles can lead to burnout and reduced productivity, ultimately affecting team outcomes. However, proponents highlight economic necessity, pointing to inflation and stagnant wages as reasons why professionals seek additional income. The rise of remote work post-COVID has only intensified this dynamic, enabling individuals to pursue side gigs or full-time dual roles with less oversight, blurring the lines between flexibility and ethical responsibility.The public response to Parekh’s remarks was mixed and emotionally charged. Many users on social media platforms expressed concern, calling the statement a “cry for help,” while others found it relatable. Some viewed Parekh’s work ethic as admirable, even inspirational, in a results-driven industry where multi-tasking is often seen as a valuable skill.However, others interpreted his message as a symptom of a larger burnout epidemic. They raised questions about mental health, personal fulfillment, and the cost of tying self-worth solely to productivity. The debate also reflected generational shifts in how work and life priorities are viewed—particularly among millennial and Gen Z tech professionals.At the heart of the controversy lies the question of ethics. Moonlighting, particularly without employer consent, presents serious implications in terms of transparency, trust, and data security. While side gigs are common in the tech industry, especially among freelancers and consultants, holding multiple full-time roles simultaneously as Soham Parekh did creates an undeniable conflict of interest.His defenders argue that the industry itself is partly to blame. Many startups demand long hours, deliverables at breakneck speed, and loyalty that often exceeds what compensation justifies. In such an environment, Parekh’s actions have been seen by some as a form of survival, albeit a controversial one. However, critics argue that regardless of intent, undisclosed dual employment undermines accountability and could lead to compromised performance, divided attention, and violations of employment contracts.","Soham parekh, the indian tech professional who became a lightning rod in the global startup ecosystem for simultaneously working full-time jobs at multiple companies, is once again in the public spotlight.

Who is Larry Ellison?

Oracle's evolution and rise in AI

A billionaire lifestyle with lasting tech impact

In a dramatic reshuffling of the global billionaire rankings, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison has surged to the second spot, overtaking Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg. His net worth has skyrocketed to an estimated $275.9 billion as of July 2025, following a 32% surge in Oracle’s stock in June alone. Ellison, who still owns nearly 41% of the company, gained more than $56 billion in just over a month. The tech mogul's leap in wealth reflects Oracle’s rising influence in cloud computing and AI, making him one of the most powerful figures in the new tech economy, second only to Elon Musk. This marks Ellison’s highest-ever ranking on the global rich list, a testament to his long-term tech bets paying off. It also signals the growing investor appetite for foundational technologies over consumer-facing platforms.Born in 1944 in New York City and raised in a modest Chicago neighborhood by his aunt and uncle, Larry Ellison’s path was far from traditional. He dropped out of two colleges before working as a programmer at companies like Amdahl and Ampex. In 1977, he co-founded Oracle with just $2,000 and two partners, Bob Miner and Ed Oates, inspired by a paper on relational databases from IBM.His outsider status in both academia and business became part of his maverick identity. Ellison’s willingness to take calculated risks defined Oracle’s culture from its earliest days.Oracle’s first big break came when the CIA contracted Ellison’s firm to build a database system, code-named “Oracle.” That deal gave the company both its name and a high-profile launchpad. Within two years, Oracle released the first commercial SQL-based database product, revolutionizing data management.Under Ellison’s leadership, Oracle became the global leader in database software and enterprise technology. Even after stepping down as CEO in 2014, Ellison stayed closely involved as chairman and chief technology officer. His strategic push into cloud computing and AI has paid off handsomely. Ellison’s decision to double down on enterprise AI has enabled Oracle to stay relevant in a rapidly shifting landscape. Rather than chase consumer trends, he focused on powering the backbones of modern businesses.Oracle’s recent growth has been powered by demand for AI-ready infrastructure and enterprise cloud services, placing it in direct competition with tech giants like Amazon and Microsoft. Massive investments in AI, along with strategic acquisitions such as Sun Microsystems and NetSuite, have helped Oracle become a major player in the AI arms race.At 80, Ellison is not only a tech visionary but also one of the world’s most flamboyant billionaires. He owns multiple properties, including a Hawaiian island (Lanai), luxury yachts, and high-end real estate in California and Japan. Despite his wealth, Ellison remains deeply involved in Oracle’s innovation strategy.Ellison’s rise is not just a story of stock gains. It is a reminder that foundational tech infrastructure, often overshadowed by social media and e-commerce, is once again central to the digital economy. From building databases in the 1970s to driving AI innovation in the 2020s, Ellison’s influence spans nearly five decades of tech evolution.","Larry ellison's net worth has skyrocketed to an estimated $275.9 billion as of july 2025.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's net worth soars $1 billion as the chipmaker joins the $4 trillion club,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huangs-net-worth-soars-1-billion-as-the-chipmaker-joins-the-4-trillion-club/articleshow/122377958.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang

Jensen Huang’s net worth passes $140 billion



Nvidia’s market value climbs above $4 trillion



How a 3.5 percent stake fuels one of the world’s biggest fortunes



Where Jensen Huang now ranks among global billionaires



Why investors keep bidding the price up

AI demand everywhere. Cloud providers, carmakers, and sovereign data-centre projects line up for the current Hopper chips and the coming Blackwell series.

Scarcity premium. Nvidia controls around 80 percent of high-end AI GPU supply, and capacity stays tight even after Taiwan’s fabs ramp up output.

Ecosystem lock-in. CUDA software and support contracts make switching costs high, so even rivals that launch competitive silicon must still lure developers away.

What could slow the rally

Export curbs. The United States still blocks top-tier chips from shipping to China, Nvidia’s largest single-country market outside the U.S.

New competition. AMD, Intel and a clutch of start-ups are readying chips that nibble at Nvidia’s margins, especially in inference workloads.

Rich valuation. At about 40 times forward earnings, the stock leaves little room for an earnings miss; even a small disappointment could yank billions from Huang’s paper wealth.

Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold. The jump did more than rewrite Wall Street leaderboards; it also pushed co-founder and Chief Executive Jensen Huang’s fortune past $140 billion. He owns about 3.5 percent of Nvidia, held directly and through family trusts, so every flicker in the share price lands straight in his pocket.Bloomberg’s daily billionaire tally shows Jensen Huang adding roughly $1 billion in a single session, and nearly $28 billion in 2025 so far. That kind of lift puts him shoulder-to-shoulder with household names like Warren Buffett, a spot unthinkable just three years ago. Investors keep paying the premium because Nvidia sells the chips that make modern AI run, from data-centre clusters to enterprise servers. The faster the market grows, the richer Huang becomes.As of the New York closing bell on 10 July, Bloomberg pegged Huang’s net worth at $143 billion, up from about $20 billion in early 2022. That leap happened in stages: $44 billion by mid-2023, $117 billion in late 2024, and now the $140-plus range. Fueled by the AI boom and soaring Nvidia shares, the difference this year alone is bigger than the entire market value of some Fortune 500 firms.The company’s share price settled near $164, capping a run that has lifted the stock 74 percent since April’s low and around 22 percent since January. Nvidia is now the dominant weight in the S&P 500, ahead of Apple and Microsoft. Analysts at Citi, Barclays and Loop Capital all raised their price targets this week, citing demand for the upcoming Blackwell platform and a backlog of data-centre orders.Huang’s percentage looks small beside founder holdings at some other tech giants, yet at a $4 trillion valuation it leaves him with shares worth roughly $140 billion. The stake figure comes from Nvidia’s March 2025 proxy filing and excludes unvested stock units. Cash, past dividend income and secondary-share sales round out the number Bloomberg uses, but the equity slice is what matters daily.With the latest move, he edges into Bloomberg’s global top ten, swapping places with Google’s Larry Page and closing in on Warren Buffett. Forbes, which refreshes less often, lists him ninth. None of the other names in that bracket made their money so fast in so short a window.","N nvidia finished trading on july 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion.

'Can't remember because of menopause'







Ann Watson, a former Citigroup employee, who was fired in 2023 for her comment that it was a nightmare to work with Indians, has now sued the bank alleging that she was unfairly discriminated. Watson was giving an internal job interview in which she told an Indian-origin interviewer that her project failed because she was working with a team of Indians. ""No offense to you,"" she said noting that the interviewer was also of Indian-origin.“The project failed because I was working with a team of Indians. No offense to you, Kapil, but you know what Indians are like to work with it’s a nightmare,” she allegedly said.When she made the comment, the interview was stopped and Watson was asked to wait in the online waiting room. When the interview resumed, she said, ""Now it's your chance, Kapil, to get me back.""The HR team later contacted her after a month of the interview and said she was fired for her racial comment.“I was horrified to hear these as I would not blame a culture or country for any kind of failure or direct any such comments toward an interview panel that I was applying for a role with,” she said in her witness statement prepared for the London hearing.Watson said she did not deny making the comment but she could not recall it because of the symptoms of long Covid-19 and menopause. She said she was remorseful though she has no recollection of what she said.Citi said its investigation into Watson was fair and impartial, and stood by the decision to fire her. Watson said the firing was too harsh and it did not take into account her 12 years of service at the bank and came at a time when she was going through a tough menopause.

A restaurant in northern China has sparked outrage after offering customers the chance to cuddle lion cubs while enjoying afternoon tea.Animal welfare groups and social media users are slamming the experience as exploitative and dangerous.The Wanhui restaurant is situated in Taiyuan City in Shanxi province. It allows guests to handle the young lions as part of a four-course tea set, priced at 1,078 yuan ($150). Since opening in June, the venue has been selling around 20 tickets daily for the experience, which also features other animals such as llamas, deer, and turtles. Videos and photos of customers cradling the lion cubs have gone viral on Chinese social media platforms like WeChat and Weibo.Animal rights advocates have condemned the practice, warning of both ethical and safety concerns. “Tearing lion cubs from their mothers so diners can handle them over afternoon tea is exploitation, not entertainment. These animals are living, feeling beings, not toys,” Jason Baker, Senior vice president at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), told news agency Reuters.Baker also criticised the trend of using animals for viral content, adding, “The animals were treated like nothing more than social media props.”Peter Li, a policy expert on China for Humane World for Animals, also raised concerns about the risks involved. “Exploiting wild animals for selfies and marketing gimmicks is not only appallingly bad animal welfare, it's also potentially risky for customers,” he was quoted as saying to Reuters. “Even a young lion is capable of lashing out and injuring a human. So, treating wild animals like props is both morally unacceptable and dangerously irresponsible. ”Despite the backlash, the restaurant has defended itself, claiming the cubs are in good health and under professional care. “They were taken care of very well, with specialised carers to tend to them,” a representative told Reuters.This incident follows another controversial hospitality service in China last month, when authorities launched an investigation into a hotel in Chongqing for its so-called “wake-up service” using red pandas. The animals were allowed to climb onto guests’ beds to rouse them in the mornings, drawing similar criticism from animal rights groups.","A restaurant in northern china has sparked outrage after offering customers the chance to cuddle lion cubs while enjoying afternoon tea.

Vanke is partly owned by Shenzhen Metro. According to a report by local news outlet SZNews, as cited by SCMP, these metre-tall robots are designed to ride elevators, get on and off platforms, board trains, and deliver goods to stores across the subway system.SZNews reported, as cited by SCMP, that the robots travel during off-peak hours and automatically exit at designated stations where 7-Eleven outlets are located. The machines then carry out deliveries that were earlier done manually by staff.""In the past, delivery workers had to park above ground, unload goods, and manually push them into subway stations,"" Li Yanyan, a manager at one of the 7-Eleven stores involved in the project, told SZNews, as quoted by South China Morning Post. ""Now, with robots, it’s much easier and more convenient.""The initiative is aimed at reducing the logistical challenges faced by shop staff working in metro stations.On their first day, the robots drew attention from passengers who stopped to take pictures as they lined up inside train carriages.The delivery system will be used to supply more than 100 7-Eleven stores located inside Shenzhen's subway stations.""These robots are specially designed with unique chassis systems that allow them to cross gaps to enter lifts and carriages,"" said Hou Shangjie, head of automation at VX Logistics, as quoted by SCMP.

A Call for Global Adoption







In a groundbreaking move that could reshape the way the world evaluates creative and scientific output, His Highness Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, and Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Dubai Future Foundation, has announced the launch of a first-of-its-kind global classification system. The initiative, called the, aims to clearly differentiate between human and machine contributions in the research, production, and publication of creative, academic, scientific, and intellectual content.As reported by the Emirates News Agency (WAM), Sheikh Hamdan emphasized the urgency of this step in light of the rapidly evolving role of artificial intelligence (AI):“Distinguishing between human creativity and artificial intelligence has become a real challenge in light of today’s rapid technological advances. This calls for a new approach to recognise the growing role of intelligent machines. That’s why we launched the world’s first Human–Machine Collaboration Icons, a classification system that brings transparency to how research documents, publications, and content are created. ”This new system is not just theoretical, it is being implemented immediately across Dubai’s government. Sheikh Hamdan has directed all Dubai Government entities to adopt the classification in their research and knowledge-based projects.The HMC classification system, developed by the Dubai Future Foundation, offers a practical and visually accessible way for readers, researchers, and decision-makers to understand the extent of AI involvement in content creation. The classification introduces five core icons that indicate the level of collaboration between humans and intelligent machines:This approach is designed to inject clarity into a domain where AI use often goes undisclosed. In today’s digital landscape, where tools like generative AI, automation systems, and intelligent algorithms increasingly shape content, it’s often difficult for consumers or collaborators to understand how much of the work was created by a human or a machine.The termin this context covers a broad range of technologies: from AI and automation tools to robotics and algorithms, or any digital system that plays a role in the research, design, writing, analysis, or presentation of information.The HMC system goes beyond top-level labels by introducing nine functional icons that show where, in the content creation process, human–machine collaboration took place. These icons are especially relevant to common research workflows and publication tasks, helping identify exactly how machines were involved.As a foundation, the classification system reflects key stages that typically involve machine assistance in research and content production. These include:For instance, a research paper may be marked “Machine Assisted” with functional icons indicating AI helped in data analysis and visuals, but ideation and writing were entirely human-led. This enables a more nuanced and transparent evaluation, providing valuable insight not only into thebut theof content creation.Importantly, the system does not attempt to assign numeric percentages or weights to the machine's contribution, acknowledging that these judgments can often be subjective. Instead, it empowers creators to be honest and transparent about the involvement of machines, providing audiences with the information they need to evaluate authenticity and integrity.Sheikh Hamdan's announcement is more than a local policy, it’s a global invitation.“We invite researchers, writers, publishers, designers, and content creators around the world to adopt this new global classification system and use it responsibly and in ways that benefit people,” he stated.This marks more than just a response to rapid technological change, it’s a clear signal that Dubai wants to shape how the world works with AI, not just adapt to it. As intelligent machines become more deeply involved in how we create and communicate, the line between human input and machine output continue to blur. The HMC Icons are meant to bring that line back into focus, not to hold innovation back, but to make sure people know what they’re looking at, and can trust what they’re reading or watching.By launching this system, Dubai is taking a leadership role in shaping ethical AI use and setting new standards for content transparency. The classification model is built to be adaptable across multiple sectors, such as academia, design, video production, and software development, where AI is increasingly integrated into everyday workflows. At its core, the system promotes honest disclosure of machine involvement, encouraging creators and institutions to uphold integrity by clearly showing how content is produced.By normalizing transparency, it may also reshape how AI involvement is perceived, less as a hidden shortcut and more as a declared, deliberate part of the creative and research process.","Dubai launched a global system to label human vs. ai roles in content creation.

Why Supercars? The Strategy Behind the Spectacle

Enforcement Efficiency: Dubai’s fast roads require police cars that can match or exceed the speed of offenders.





Public Engagement: Tourists frequently pose for photos with the cars, which strengthens the relationship between the force and the public.





Global Branding: The fleet projects Dubai’s image as a city of the future, rooted in innovation, luxury, and excellence.





Deterrence: The presence of high-performance vehicles serves as a visible deterrent to unlawful activity.





Sustainability: With growing EV integration, Dubai is aligning its law enforcement with green goals.





The Future of Policing?





In most parts of the world, police cars are designed for utility, not spectacle. In Dubai, however, they are a statement. Since 2013, the Dubai Police force has rewritten the playbook on law enforcement visibility by curating a vehicle fleet that looks more like an elite car show than a motor pool. With Lamborghinis, Bugattis, Rolls-Royces, and even a flying hoverbike, the Dubai Police fleet represents a unique blend of security, branding, and futuristic thinking.The transformation began in April 2013 with the induction of a Lamborghini Aventador into the police force. This was not simply about performance,it was about perception. The goal was clear: to elevate the image of Dubai as a global city of innovation, prosperity, and forward-thinking governance. Today, that vision is fully realized through a vehicle collection that symbolizes prestige, discipline, and a new form of civic engagement.Dubai’s roads are filled with high-performance vehicles owned by residents and tourists alike. To maintain authority and presence in such an environment, law enforcement vehicles had to match the city’s personality. These cars are strategically deployed in high-profile locations such as Downtown Dubai, Jumeirah Beach Residence, Dubai Mall, the Palm Jumeirah, and international expos,where they serve more as ambassadors than enforcers.While many of them are not used for daily patrols or high-speed pursuits, their presence deters crime and promotes a visible connection between police and the public.The Dubai Police force boasts a fleet of numerous supercars, but the exact number remains undisclosed. The collection is constantly evolving, and while not every vehicle is publicly confirmed, the lineup includes an unmatched variety of exotic, electric, luxury, and tactical models.The most expensive and fastest car in the Dubai Police fleet, the Bugatti Veyron is powered by an 8.0-litre quad-turbocharged W16 engine that produces 1,001 horsepower. It can accelerate from 0 to 100 km/h in just 2.5 seconds and reaches speeds beyond 400 km/h. Estimated at $1.6 million, it is a symbol of unmatched engineering and status.The flagship that started it all, the Aventador features a 6.5-litre V12 engine delivering 691 horsepower.
