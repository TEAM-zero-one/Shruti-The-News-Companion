Deepfake Shock: Nirmala Sitharaman Reveals Fake Videos Of Herself Online, Warns Of AI’s Dark Side

Armour up with TOI to fight deepening threat of deepfakes





In a world where seeing is no longer believing, India is facing a new digital menace: AI-generated deepfakes.These hyper-realistic videos and audio clips don’t just distort reality. They manipulate public perception, spread misinformation and undermine trust in democracy itself.With 85.5 per cent of Indian households owning at least one smartphone, mobile phones have become India’s bank, classroom and television, making citizens more vulnerable to digital deception.During the 2024 elections, for instance, satirical deepfakes became a campaign tool of sorts. Apart from resurrecting dead leaders, it featured clips such as one that featured PM Narendra Modi dancing the garba with women and Kamal Nath dissing a popular welfare scheme.Though investigations and arrests followed, such videos blur the line between fact and fiction, risking the distortion of voter opinion and the integrity of the democratic process.Cybersecurity experts warn AI is also becoming a key tool in cybercrime: 80 per cent phishing campaigns in 2024 involved AI, with deepfakes exploited for scams.“When you can fake images, audio, and video, how do you know if a real video is real? Suddenly, everything is in question,” said Hany Farid, professor at the University of California, Berkeley, in a TOI interview last year about the worrying rise in AI misuse.The deepfake threat extends beyond politics. Recently, finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman highlighted the misuse of AI to clone voices and produce fake videos impersonating her, warning of potential financial scams and the erosion of public trust. “I have seen several deepfake videos of myself being circulated online, manipulated to mislead citizens and distort facts,” Sitharaman said in Mumbai. “Criminals are using AI to mimic voices, clone identities, and create lifelike videos,” she added.Given that over 97% of India’s urban youth aged 15 to 29 owns a smartphone, the impact of such misinformation on a generation is worrying, say observers. “Deepfakes began in 2016. Back then, it was a joke. But the technology has only gotten better. Earlier, there were photoshopped face swaps. Now there are lipsync fakes,” said Prof. Farid, warning that the tech has become more refined, raising the risk of harassment of women through the use of non-consensual sexual imagery.In Nov 2023, actress Rashmika Mandanna became a victim of a viral deepfake video that superimposed her face on to compromising content, sparking widespread outrage. “The very term ‘deepfake’ comes from a Reddit user who in the early days of this technology used it to create porn,” said Farid, calling the new term ‘Generative AI’ clever “rebranding” by the male-dominated tech industry.As AI evolves, India must strengthen legal frameworks, enhance digital literacy, and bring together minds across sectors to ensure safety, say experts. “We need to label everything as real or not real,” said Farid, “We need real disclosures.” To combat the deepening threat of deep fakes, TOI has already started armouring up. Watch out for our ‘Don’t Get Scammed’ stories to stay informed and aware. After all, as Farid puts it, “if you don’t know what’s real, how will you know what’s false”?","Ai-generated videos and audio clips don’t just distort reality.

NEW DELHI: India's rice production during the 2025-26 kharif season that ended in Oct reached a record 124.5 million tonnes (MT), which is 1.7 MT (over 1%) more than the production of kharif rice last year, the agriculture ministry said on Wednesday. Output of pulses, oilseeds and cotton, however, marginally declined.The ministry's first advance estimates of kharif crops output put the total estimated foodgrain production for the 2025-26 season at around 173 MT, up from 169 MT a year earlier.These estimates are based on yield trends from previous years, other ground-level inputs, regional observations and data received from states.Revisions of output figures are made during subsequent estimates when the actual crop cutting experiment yield data becomes available. The ministry releases four advance estimates before final production figures for a crop year.Sowing of kharif crops starts at the onset of monsoon in June, and harvest generally begins in Oct.""Excessive rainfall in some areas of the country affected crops, but most areas have benefited significantly from a good monsoon, leading to overall good crop growth,"" agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan said.Maize production is estimated at 28 MT in 2025-26, up from nearly 25 MT the previous year. On the other hand, pulses production is estimated marginally lower at 7.4 MT compared to 7.7 MT in 2024-25. Similarly, oilseeds output is estimated at 27.5 MT, down from 28 MT the previous year.Cotton output is also pegged lower at 29.2 million bales (170 kg each) compared to 29.7 million bales a year earlier, while jute and mesta output is estimated at 8.3 million bales (180 kg each), down from 8.4 million bales.","India's rice production during the 2025-26 kharif season that ended in oct reached a record 124.5 million tonnes.

Cardi B Turns Her Umbilical Cord Into GOLD!

More coverage on Cardi B and Stefon Diggs:

The placenta forms an extraordinary bond between mother and child, with the umbilical cord as their lifeline of silent conversation. When the baby arrives, the placenta follows, marking the end of this quiet connection. For nine months, mother and baby shared unspoken messages through this remarkable link, only to part with it at birth. But what if that connection could last a lifetime? That is probably the vision behind Mommy Made Encapsulation, a service that allows mothers to preserve their placenta forever. Such preservation was chosen by Cardi B , partner of New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs The couple recently welcomed a baby boy into their lives. Following the heartfelt tradition, she began with her third child, daughter Blossom, in October 2024, the Grammy-winning rapper chose to honor her fourth child with Diggs in November 2025 in a similar way. She entrusted Mommy Made Encapsulation to transform her pregnancy journey into cherished keepsakes, capturing the memorable moments when her baby was still growing inside her. The company crafted a heart-shaped gold pendant from the baby’s umbilical cord and turned the placenta into nourishing vitamins to support her post-partum recovery.Curious about how the gold pendant comes to life? The process begins with careful cleaning of the placenta, followed by a wash with blue dye that highlights its unique texture.After another rinse, the technician gently separates the placenta from the umbilical cord. The cord, now a striking blue, is shaped around a heart-shaped metal ring, with any extra length trimmed away. Finally, the piece is dipped in shimmering gold chrome, transforming it into a gleaming keepsake. The company describes it as a way to honor the first bond between mother and child. According to the company’s website, “The umbilical cord keepsake is your baby’s umbilical cord dehydrated in the shape of a heart and then dipped in gold chrome. The end result looks and feels like metal and is the perfect way to honor the first connection you shared with your baby.” It costs $50.The “AM I THE DRAMA?” creator took things a step further by having her placenta turned into vitamin capsules. That’s not all. She also tried something called a Placenta Print. The process starts with cleaning the placenta and dyeing it blue to look like a tree. Then, a sheet of paper is pressed on top to make the company’s signature Placenta Print, which costs $65. Their website explains that the print is made by painting the placenta with food-grade coloring (one gets to choose the colors) and stamping it onto a 12-by-18-inch poster to create a Tree of Life painting. After the print is made, the placenta receives a fresh rinse before its transformation into capsules begins. Lemon juice, cayenne pepper, and ginger are added to the raw placenta.The website explains that the Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) method is used, with careful steaming at 220 degrees F for 30 minutes to ensure safety. Bacteria and viruses cannot survive at temperatures higher than 131 degrees F. Although, it loses some of the nutritional benefits when steamed, no research determins how much is lost. The placenta is a powerful organ, and all the mothers who have received capsules from Mommy Made Encapsulation still rave about its effects and feel its power. The placenta is gently steamed in specially designed steaming bags made up of heat-resistant, FDA-approved nylon, safe for cooking and free of BPA. Once steamed, the placenta is dried, ground into a fine powder, and sealed into capsules.Each placenta yields 160-180 pills, which, when taken regularly, can offer many benefits for new mothers, such as increased energy levels, reduced post-natal bleeding, lesser chance of baby blues, balanced mood and hormone levels, increased milk supply, lesser chance of post-partum depression, higher iron levels, uterus returning back to pre-pregnancy size faster, losing baby weight faster, and enhanced bonding experience with the baby. The nutrients found in placenta are vitamin B6, vitamin B12, vitamin E, iron, cytokines, and stem cells.The capsules are available in a variety of flavors, including strawberry, orange, bubblegum, lime, berry, grape, and a vegan option. According to the website, these capsules never expire. They just need to be kept at room temperature and in a dry place. The pills can be taken with other medications. The cost of encapsulation starts at $500. This never-heard-before ritual has even captured the curiosity of stars like Megan Fox and Vanessa Hudgens , who, like Cardi B, have embraced the trend of creating placenta keepsakes.Mommy Made Encapsulation was founded by mother-of-four Juliane Corona in 2016. Juliane and her team have encapsulated for over 40,000 moms, including celebrity clients such as Brittany Nassif, Jacqie Rivera, Alondra Dessy, Molly Brazy, Leslie Hernandez, Gemma Farrell, Adizia Benzon, Andrea Espada, Brittani Boren, and more.",The grammy-winning rapper entrusted mommy made encapsulation to transform her pregnancy journey into cherished keepsakes.

A gossip blog publicly claims Offset’s blogger tried to push stories about Cardi B

“Don’t come to me with info if you can’t back it up because you don’t want to be exposed.”

“I need to make these people pay me for wasting my time.”

If you thought the Cardi B and Offset saga couldn’t get any messier, the internet just handed us a freshly brewed pot of drama. A popular gossip page has now stepped into the crossfire and not with speculation, but with receipts claiming that Offset’s alleged blogger friend has been sliding into their DMs all summer trying to plant tea about Cardi. And according to the blog? The tea wasn’t just cold… it was straight-up false. The situation has fans whispering about a bigger pattern of “narrative planting” behind the scenes, and suddenly the storyline feels way deeper.The drama erupted after @sweetteatheblog posted a message accusing Offset of “sending his blogger” to feed them questionable information about Cardi B. The blog names a woman — Alexis, also known as Siana who they say has been in their DMs “all summer” offering alleged insider tea.But according to the post, everything flipped when the page accidentally revealed her name in an earlier story. That’s when the blogger allegedly got angry and the blog realized something was off. The page makes it clear they’re not here for unverified gossip, especially when it involves someone they explicitly said they “like” Cardi B.The most shocking part of the post is the blog’s admission that the last piece of tea Alexis allegedly delivered turned out to be false.The blog even issued a public apology to Cardi and her team for the misinformation.In their words:And then the punchline:This single sentence sent fans spinning, especially those who already believed Offset might be behind certain narratives circulating online.For months, fans have speculated that Offset has been connected to certain gossip pages and content creators who consistently push unflattering narratives about Cardi B with Stefon Diggs. While none of this has been verified, the internet loves a pattern, and this new blog claim only fueled those suspicions.Users on X began stitching together alleged timelines, pointing out how certain stories conveniently aligned with Offset’s side of the drama. Some even revisited Cardi’s own livestream earlier this year where she accused Offset of using “blogger friends” to stir mess around her name.This new receipt acted like gasoline on an already-lit fire.The breakup between Cardi B and Offset has already played out publicly, with leaked texts, explosive accusations, and messy social posts.

Common mistakes when restoring old photos with Google Nano Banana Pro

Also read|





There is something magical about rediscovering an old, worn photograph. The soft yellows, the creases, the fading edges and the stubborn scratches hold stories that feel too precious to lose. Until recently, restoring these photos required hours of painstaking manual editing. Now Google Nano Banana Pro has made that process far easier. With the right prompts and a bit of creative direction, you can revive portraits, repair damage, and bring lost details back to life in a way that looks natural and polished. Whether you are working with a family album or a treasured vintage snapshot, this tool gives you professional level results with far less effort.Google Nano Banana Pro uses advanced diffusion modelling and context-aware reconstruction. In simple terms, it analyses each pixel, predicts missing details and rebuilds textures so the restored image looks authentic rather than overly sharpened. It also understands lighting, skin tones, shadows and colour balance, which makes it one of the most reliable tools for repairing vintage portraits. Instead of plastic-looking edits, you get subtle, human-like restoration that respects the original photo.The model also handles very damaged images. Torn edges, fold marks, grainy patches and faded backgrounds can be reconstructed automatically. For photos from the 70s and 80s, which often have tinted colour casts, the tool balances hues without making the image look artificial.Using this model effectively comes down to guiding it with clear prompts. Here are prompt structures that work well for damaged or faded photos:“Restore this old photograph with natural colours, clean details and accurate lighting. Remove scratches, stains and noise while keeping the original style.”“Reconstruct the face gently, retain natural skin texture, preserve original expressions and repair damaged areas without over-smoothing.”“Neutralise yellow tint, improve contrast, balance highlights and shadows, and restore film-like tones.”“Rebuild missing or torn sections, reconstruct textures, recover facial features accurately and maintain the vintage feel of the image.”You can also add extra artistic instructions such as “keep grain minimal” or “retain film quality”. The more specific you are, the more consistent the results.To ensure your restored photos look natural, keep these expert guidelines in mind:It is tempting to eliminate all grain, but older photographs naturally have texture. Leave a little grain to maintain the vintage character.For very old family photographs, match the restored colours with reference images from that era. For example, mid-century colour palettes often used softer reds and muted greens.Shadows anchor a photograph. If you remove too many shadows or highlights, the restored image may look flat. Let the model repair damage, but keep the original lighting structure intact.While the model handles most reconstruction automatically, sometimes background objects can appear too clean. Adjusting the prompt to “preserve background imperfections” can solve this.Many beginners make the error of giving vague prompts like “fix this photo”. This causes incorrect smoothing, unnatural facial features or oddly bright colours. Another mistake is using portrait prompts for landscape images, which can distort objects. Over-sharpening is also common, resulting in a digital rather than vintage look. Always compare the original and restored versions side by side to ensure the emotional tone remains the same. This helps you refine edits, preserve important details, and maintain the original atmosphere that gives the photograph its distinctive authenticity.Photo restoration is more than fixing pixels. It is a way of honouring memories that might otherwise fade. With Google Nano Banana Pro and the right prompt strategy, you can bring old pictures back to life while preserving their history and charm. A few careful edits and a well-structured prompt are often all it takes to rebuild details, refresh colours and revive treasured moments. If you have a box of old photographs waiting to be restored, this tool is a gentle and precise way to begin.","Google nano banana pro uses advanced diffusion modelling and context-aware reconstruction.

Nvidia’s historic milestone



JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon doesn’t sugarcoat AI impact on jobs





JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has now hailed Nvidia as an unbelievable company and has also cautioned investors that some artificial intelligence stocks may be trading at an unsustainable levels. Speaking with CNN’s Erin Burnett, Dimon said that the US remains the ‘most prosperous’ economy in the world. He adds that the US economy is supported by diverse and deep capital markets including venture capital, private credit and hedge funds. “There’s no question some people will lose money,” Dimon said, drawing parallels to the dot-com era. “But mankind should benefit,” he added, emphasising that the underlying technology is real and transformative—even if valuations are currently inflated.Dimon emphasized that AI is a genuine productivity revolution, comparing its current stage to the early days of the Internet. “It’s almost at the beginning,” he said, noting that while not every company will succeed, AI will produce transformative winners just as the internet gave rise to Google, Facebook, and Amazon.Dimon acknowledged that valuations in the AI sector may be inflated, but stressed that the underlying technology will reshape industries and improve lives.“Mankind should benefit,” he said, even if “valuations today may be too high for some of these folks.”In October 2025, Nvidia became the first company in history to surpass a $5 trillion market valuation. Its market cap currently stands at $4.74 trillion, underscoring its dominance in the AI chip market. Dimon’s remarks came shortly after Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang predicted that China will win the AI race, a claim that drew sharp pushback from President Donald Trump, who vowed the U.S. would not allow other nations access to Nvidia’s most advanced chips.In another interview with Bloomberg TV, Dimon talked about the impact of AI on the job market. “People shouldn’t put their head in the sand. It is going to affect jobs,” he said. “AI will enhance some aspects of work, but also eliminate some jobs.” However, Dimon also stressed on the fact that JPMorgan is focused on retaining and redeploying employees whose roles are impacted by automation. “We’ll have more jobs, but there’ll probably be less jobs in certain functions,” Dimon added. “You’re better off being way ahead of the curve,” Dimon added.Dimon also added that the bank has invested about $2 billion as an annual investment in AI and is already making $2 billion in direct benefits.

"Apple CEO Tim Cook may not be retiring soon, here’s why",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-ceo-tim-cook-may-not-be-retiring-soon-heres-why/articleshow/125533511.cms,"Apple CEO Tim Cook Confirms Majority Of iPhones Sold In U.S. Now Made In India

Tim Cook to reportedly retire in 2026

Tim Cook’s continued leadership

What’s next for Apple’s executive team





Apple CEO Tim Cook may not be retiring anytime soon. Earlier this month, a report by Financial Times revealed that Tim Cook is planning to step down as soon as next year. However, a new report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman suggests that Cook has no plans of stepping down in the near future. Apple has been preparing for a leadership transition for quite some time. In 2024, Bloomberg revealed that Apple’s senior vice president of hardware engineering John Ternus was at the center of succession discussions. Ternus the youngest member of Apple’s executive team looks after the hardware division and is also widely respected by Apple CEO Tim Cook and former COO Jeff Williams.Then in October this year, Bloomberg suggests that the internal spotlight on Ternus was ‘intensifying’, making him the likely candidate to succeed Cook.Earlier this month, a report by Financial Times revealed that Apple CEO Tim Cook may step down from his position in between January and June 2026. As per the report, the current CEO Tim Cook is said to be succeeded by John Ternus, Apple’s senior vice-president of hardware engineering. However, no final decision has been made, sources told the publication. They also stressed that the transition plans are not tied to Apple’s current performance, as the company heads into what is expected to be a strong holiday season for iPhone sales.Taking about this upcoming transition, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman wrote, “Based on everything I’ve learned in recent weeks, I don’t believe a departure by the middle of next year is likely.” This means there are less chances of Tim Cook retiring anytime soon.Cook, who turned 65 this month, took over as CEO in 2011 after co-founder Steve Jobs died. Under his leadership, Apple’s valuation has climbed from around $350 billion to $4 trillion. Despite strong results last month, Apple’s roughly 12% stock rise this year trails rivals like Alphabet, Nvidia and Microsoft, which have surged on AI momentum.“Yes, Apple will eventually have a new leader. And, yes, it’s probably Ternus. But unless there is some unexpected event that forces Cook to step down sooner than planned, that moment is not at hand. But there still may be significant movement on Apple’s executive team. As I recently reported, silicon chief Johny Srouji is seriously evaluating his future at the company, while Apple has been on the hunt for a new AI leader,” said Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman.While the retirement of Apple CEO Tim Cook is not imminent, Bloomberg reveals that the company will still witness some leadership changes in the coming weeks. As per the report,Apple’s silicon chief, Johny Srouji may be evaluating his future at the company. Also, Apple is actively looking for a new AI leader in order to strengthen its position in generative AI sector.","Earlier this month, a report by financial times revealed that tim cook is planning to step down as soon as next year.

Google Meet outage : What the company said



We are experiencing an issue with Google Meet beginning on Tuesday, 2025-11-25 21:41 PST.

Our engineering team continues to investigate the issue and work on a mitigation strategy.

We will provide an update by Wednesday, 2025-11-26 02:00 PST with current details.

We apologize to all who are affected by the disruption.





Google Meet, Google’s video conferencing platform is experiencing widespread outage. Thousands of Google Meet users in India were not able to join meetings. According to outage tracking website, DownDetector, 65% users were not able to access the website for Google Meet. Around 33% users complained of server connection issue and 2% had issues with the video quality.According to Downdetector, reports of issues surged around midday, with users citing “502 error” messages and failed attempts to connect to ongoing meetings. The outage mainly affected users in India and some users in other countries also reported the issues. Many users also complained of log in issues and many were also not able to join the scheduled calls including work calls, online classes and other virtual events.At its peak, about 1700 people in India reported problems with the app. Downdetector suggests that the issue has now been resolved as the number of reports are showing a downward curve.In easier words, '502 Bad Gateway' error in Google Meet means that there is a temporary server communication failure.There may three reasons for it:The primary issue is typically on Google's side, not your personal device or internet connection.In this case, restarting your machine or router won't solve the problem.Google's servers (or an intermediary system required to connect you to the service) temporarily failed to get a valid response from the backend service needed to load your meeting.The platform cannot load or connect you to the meeting at that moment. A bug could have broken the process, causing a server-side problem. This means that the error is temporary and generally resolves once Google restores stability to the service.As of Wednesday afternoon, Google had not issued a detailed statement on the cause of the outage. The company’s status dashboard showed service disruptions, but no timeline for resolution was provided.The company has update the staus page at 2:08 pm IST with this message:","Google’s video conferencing platform is experiencing widespread outage.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

“We have built enough strength as a company to weather great models shipping elsewhere competition... (so), having most of our research team focused on really getting to superintelligence is critically important,”

“It s**ks that we have to do so many hard things at the same time — the best research lab, the best AI infrastructure company, and the best AI platform/product company — but such is our lot in life. And I wouldn't trade positions with any other company,”

“This partnership is a step toward ensuring the core technologies of the AI era are built here [US],” and added that AI infrastructure production presents a

“generational opportunity to reindustrialise America.”

""Congrats to Google on Gemini 3! Looks like a great model,"" he said after the launch. Pichai replied with 'folded hands' emoji.





ChatGPT maker OpenAI 's CEO Sam Altman is optimistic about Google 's recent successes in artificial intelligence (AI) technology. In a recent internal memo to colleagues, Altman acknowledged that the AI startup rival's success couldHowever, Altman reassured that OpenAI isand anticipates emerging as the leader in the AI race. It's important to note that Altman's memo was written before Google's Gemini 3 was released, a model the tech giant has described as its most capable to date. Software developers have reported that the new model performed well on tasks such as automating website and product design and writing code, which is a lucrative revenue stream for OpenAI and its competitors, such as Anthropic.Concerns about OpenAI's slowing growth arose late this summer. During a recent quarterly earnings call with investors, the company’s CFO, Sarah Friar, confirmed that user engagement with the popular AI chatbot ChatGPT had cooled, despite the company's otherwise positive financial results.According to a report by The Information (as seen by The Economic Times), Sam Altman's memo noted that competitors such as Google and Anthropic are narrowing the gap in the AI raceAnthropic’s Claude model generates computer code for various tasks using conversational prompts.Meanwhile, Google has been integrating its Gemini AI chatbot into its search app, productivity tools and other services. However, recently, Claude gained a new challenger from OpenAI with the introduction of Codex.Google also holds an economic advantage. OpenAI’s growth has been rapid and the company now carries a valuation of around $500 billion as a for-profit entity. It is expected to bring in about $13 billion in revenue, but is estimated to burn roughly $100 billion in its push toward superintelligence.With a market value of about $3.5 trillion, Google reported free cash flow of over $70 billion in the past four quarters. A significant portion of this comes from providing cloud services to OpenAI, Anthropic and other competitors.Sam Altman also encouraged OpenAI employees to stay confident and focus on the company's larger goals.Altman wrote in the internal memo.Altman added.Recently, OpenAI partnered with Apple's biggest suuplier Foxconn to design and build AI data-centre components in the US. Under this partnership, OpenAI will help develop future server systems and may purchase Foxconn-produced hardware in the coming days. Altman noted that this collaboration can strengthen American manufacturing infrastructure.Commenting on the partnership, Altman said:Foxconn will join OpenAI’s supply chain to manufacture AI-related hardware in a more American way. The company, known for iPhone assembly, also manufactures AI servers and supplies components to Nvidia.Commenting on the partnership, Foxconn chairman Young Liu said that the companyIn September, Oracle also inked a $300 billion deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Since then, the company has shed more than $300 billion in market value, and Wall Street is starting to wonder if a partnership between the companies will bring returns or pose risks for Oracle.","Openai ceo sam altman acknowledges google's ai advancements, noting potential temporary economic challenges but expressing confidence in openai's rapid progress.

"Now, with 5G smartphones, 25 ex-Maoists log into new life in Chhattisgarh",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/raipur/now-with-5g-smartphones-25-ex-maoists-log-into-new-life-in-chhattisgarh/articleshow/125603868.cms,"RAIPUR:

Giving a digital lifeline and access into mainstream society to the former Maoists who have chosen rehabilitation, Bastar's Sukma district administration distributed high-end 5G smartphones to 25 former cadres housed at govt's Naxal rehabilitation centre.Officials described the move as a “practical and humane” step under Chhattisgarh’s rehabilitation policy, aimed at ensuring that those who have left the path of violence are not left behind in an increasingly digital world. This is the same group of former Maoists whom the home minister Vijay Sharma met recently at the camp on Nov 22 and told them they should become 'technologically empowered.'Speaking to TOI, Sukma SP Kiran Chavan said that the initiative has been taken by state govt and 25 former cadres were given smartphones worth Rs 10,000 mobile so that they can watch cricket matches, movies. The basic purpose is that they feel empowered and connected to the mainstream. These cadres had surrendered about three-four months back, many others will also be given mobile phones, SP said.The distribution was carried out under the supervision of Collector Devesh Kumar Dhruv and Sukma SP.Officials said the devices, equipped with features such as a 50-megapixel dual camera and a 5,000 mAh fast-charging battery, are intended to be more than just communication tools.With internet access, the former Maoists will now be able to connect to online education platforms, skill-development courses, government portals and digital payments — all seen as crucial stepping stones for rebuilding their lives, officials said in a statement.“This is not just about giving a phone; it is about opening a window to opportunities,” a senior district official said, adding that the administration wants rehabilitated cadres to be able to search for jobs, learn new skills, stay updated on government schemes and explore options for self-employment, including in agriculture and small businesses.Alongside intensified operations in the forests, the state has been trying to offer credible alternatives — housing, livelihood support, training and social acceptance — to those willing to surrender. Officials said the smartphones will help the surrendered cadres keep in regular touch with family members and officials, reducing isolation and strengthening their sense of security and inclusion.Access to verified information is also expected to counter rumours, fear, and the influence of remaining underground Maoist networks. The district administration has clarified that the remaining residents of the rehabilitation centre will also be provided similar 5G smartphones “very soon”.“Technology can become a bridge — from the life they are leaving behind to the life they are trying to build,” another official said, stressing that the success of rehabilitation depends not just on financial assistance but on equipping people to stand on their own feet. Sukma, one of the core districts of the erstwhile Maoist stronghold in south Bastar, has in recent months seen a rising number of surrenders under the state’s rehabilitation policy.By putting 5G-enabled smartphones in the hands of surrendered cadres, the administration is hoping to send out a dual message across the conflict zone: that the state is serious both about ending violence and about supporting those who choose to leave it behind, officials said. For now, the Sukma rehabilitation centre — once home to men and women who lived off the grid in the forests — is slowly turning into a space where life after extremism increasingly runs through touchscreens, apps and online classrooms.","25 former maoists were given smartphones worth rs 10,000 mobile so that they can watch cricket matches, movies.

Baltimore Orioles’ rotation needs after key departures

What Dylan Cease offers Baltimore

Understanding Cease’s “trend” season pattern

Why a Cease–Orioles union makes sense

What comes next for Baltimore

Themay be approaching a pivotal offseason, and league observers believe the front office could be preparing a significant move. With criticism mounting around small-market teams minimizing payroll while profits rise, Baltimore finds itself at a crossroad. After a season that pushed them close to that category, the Orioles are being urged by analysts to make a decisive splash - and that splash may come in the form of San Diego Padres star Dylan Cease.According to FanSided’s Christopher Kline, Baltimore’s most urgent need is an ace-caliber starter capable of anchoring the rotation following major offseason losses. He wrote, “The Baltimore Orioles need an ace, especially with Zach Eflin hitting the open market and Grayson Rodriguez shipped to Anaheim… Dylan Cease has his bouts of inconsistency, but he’s a strikeout machine, and he profiles as one of the most dominant arms in MLB when he’s firing on all cylinders. ” (H/t: Sporting News)Dylan Cease, a former Cy Young candidate entering the market at roughly $13.75 million, brings one of the most intriguing profiles among available pitchers. His high-ceiling, high-variance track record has long made him a difficult player to project, but evaluators agree: at his best, Cease is one of the most overpowering arms in baseball.Here is a look at his most recent campaign:Those numbers illustrate why teams remain attracted to him.While the ERA does not reflect ace-level consistency, his advanced metrics - especially the 3.56 FIP and elite strikeout rate - suggest stronger performance beneath the surface. Cease still ranks among the most dominant arms when he is fully dialed in.Baltimore Orioles’ rotation picture has shifted quickly:• Zach Eflin is hitting free agency• Grayson Rodriguez has been traded to the Anaheim Angels• Last winter’s failed bid for Corbin Burnes showed the club was willing to spend - but couldn’t close the dealThis offseason brings renewed urgency. With Rodriguez gone, the Orioles lack a dependable set-and-forget ace, increasing the likelihood they make an assertive push for a frontline starter.If the Orioles follow Kline’s prediction, Dylan Cease would bring:• A swing-and-miss profile rarely found in free agency• A strong underlying analytical foundation• A proven track record of contending for major awards• The potential to immediately become Baltimore’s No. 1 starterOne of the more interesting aspects of Cease’s career is the season-to-season volatility. Analysts often point out a pattern:• One season: Cy Young candidate• Next season: mid-rotation starter• Following season: major bounce-backFollowing that cycle, the upcoming year is projected to be one of his “good” seasons, further boosting interest from teams needing upside at the top of the rotation. Baltimore, entering 2026 with expectations but lacking certainty on the mound, fits that description perfectly.From a roster-building standpoint, the fit is clear. Baltimore needs a front-of-the-rotation pitcher, and Cease is one of the few available starters capable of performing at that level. At approximately $13.75 million, he also lands in a salary tier that allows the Orioles to add premium talent without dismantling future financial plans.Considering the increasing frustration around small-market spending trends across MLB, a signing like this would also help reinforce that Baltimore remains committed to contending rather than cutting back.If the Orioles intend to stay competitive in the American League, anchoring the rotation must be the first priority. Cease checks every box the franchise is searching for - affordability, upside, proven dominance, and the ability to immediately stabilize a rotation that lost two key arms.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Tampa Bay Rays expected to pursue $115.5 million veteran Philadelphia Phillies catcher to address key roster weakness As Kline notes, Baltimore simply needs a reliable, top-end option. If they decide to act aggressively in free agency, Dylan Cease may indeed become the most logical - and highest-impact - path forward as they search for their next ace.","San diego padres star dylan cease is a former cy young candidate entering the market at roughly $13.75 million.

"Once MacKenzie Scott borrowed $1,000 from her friend to pay college fees, now the billionaire is returning the favour",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/once-mackenzie-scott-borrowed-1000-from-her-friend-to-pay-college-fees-now-the-billionaire-is-returning-the-favour/articleshow/125598151.cms,"MacKenzie Scott’s path from borrower to major philanthropist

A philanthropic approach shaped by access, equity and scale

A full circle story of kindness and opportunity





MacKenzie Scott, one of the world’s most influential philanthropists, has come full circle after once relying on a friend’s financial help to stay in college. As a Princeton undergraduate, Scott faced dropping out when she could not afford $1,000 in fees, until her roommate Jeannie Tarkenton secured the money for her. Decades later, Scott, now a billionaire, is backing Tarkenton’s student-lending startup in a gesture many see as a symbolic return of kindness.Scott has written that the experience of receiving help at a vulnerable moment influenced her views on generosity. Her former roommate recalls finding her in tears and arranging the $1,000 loan that allowed Scott to continue her studies at Princeton. Decades later, she is effectively repaying that act by becoming a financial backer of the company her former roommate went on to build, channelling resources into the same kind of students who face the struggles she once did. The story has resurfaced as Scott continues to direct her wealth toward expanding educational access, equity, and economic opportunity.With a net worth estimated at around 34 billion dollars, Scott has given away more than 19 billion dollars since her 2019 divorce from Amazon founder Jeff Bezos , in which she received a substantial shareholding. Rather than establishing a traditional foundation or maintaining a public philanthropy profile, she became known for issuing surprise, unrestricted grants to organisations serving disadvantaged communities, often without seeking attention or public credit.Tarkenton, the roommate who helped Scott stay enrolled, later founded Funding U, a for-profit lending company offering merit-based loans to low-income students who lack co-signers. Scott has become a key financial supporter of the venture, providing capital that reduces risk for banks and makes it possible for more students to secure funding. The company assesses applicants based on academic records, internship experience, and likelihood of completing a degree, a model supporters say better reflects the realities of first-generation and low-income students.Following her divorce, Scott launched a large-scale giving initiative that directed billions of dollars to organisations across the United States. Her donations have supported education, community development, women’s initiatives, food access, and poverty reduction. Among her most widely recognised contributions were major gifts to Historically Black Colleges and Universities, as well as tribal, Indigenous-serving, and community colleges that had rarely received major private donations in the past.Scott once relied on a small loan to stay in university, and she is now supporting a venture designed to ensure other students do not face the same barrier. The renewed connection between Scott and Tarkenton highlights how early experiences can shape long-term commitments to expanding opportunity and educational access. What began as a modest favour between friends has evolved into an initiative reaching students across the country, demonstrating how individual acts of support can grow into broader systems of opportunity.","Mackenzie scott once relied on a small loan to stay in university.

Autonomous rides now available in Abu Dhabi



Background of Uber and WeRide partnership



Global expansion and industry context



Service details and passenger experience







Uber has officially introduced fully driverless rides in Abu Dhabi, partnering with Chinese autonomous vehicle company WeRide. This launch marks the first commercial robotaxi service without a human driver in the Middle East and expands Uber’s autonomous vehicle operations beyond the United States.Riders in Abu Dhabi can now request a WeRide robotaxi through UberX or Uber Comfort. There is also a new “Autonomous” ride category, the first dedicated self driving option globally on Uber’s platform. After two weeks of private trials, the service went live on November 26, operating initially in designated areas of Yas Island. On board support is available via the app and through an in vehicle tablet, ensuring passenger safety and assistance during rides.WeRide confirmed that public commercial operations have started without a vehicle specialist on board. The robotaxis are fully autonomous, achieving Level 4 automation. This means the vehicles can manage all driving tasks and respond to road situations independently within approved zones. Although human intervention is not required, the system includes protocols to safely stop the vehicle and allows manual takeover if necessary.Uber and WeRide first began their collaboration in Abu Dhabi in December 2024, initially offering autonomous rides with a safety operator. The partnership expanded to Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, in October 2025, with similar services. Earlier this year, Uber rolled out robotaxi services in Austin and Atlanta, and in Phoenix in late 2023 through Alphabet’s Waymo.The companies plan to further expand the Abu Dhabi service by the end of 2025 to cover more areas within the city’s core, including Al Reem and Al Maryah. Currently, WeRide operates over 100 robotaxis in the Middle East and maintains a first mover advantage in the UAE, having been active in autonomous vehicle operations since 2021. In 2023, WeRide became the first company in the UAE to receive a national license allowing all types of self driving vehicles to be tested and operated on public roads, subject to local approvals.WeRide has already deployed fully driverless services in Beijing and Guangzhou, China, while Uber continues to expand its autonomous vehicle operations globally. In May 2025, Uber announced plans to introduce WeRide robotaxis in 15 additional cities, including locations in Europe, over the next five years. The company has also secured a six year robotaxi agreement with electric vehicle maker Lucid and autonomous vehicle startup Nuro.Competitors are adopting similar technology. Lyft, for example, partnered with Waymo in September 2025 to launch robotaxi services in Nashville next year. Despite these moves, Uber has not disclosed how revenue from autonomous rides is shared with its partners.In Abu Dhabi, passengers can increase their chances of getting a robotaxi by selecting the autonomous option in the app. The vehicles operate in designated zones with safety measures built in, including on-board support and the ability for passengers to interact with the system through a tablet. The robotaxis promise hands-free driving in approved areas while maintaining safety protocols that allow the vehicle to stop or enable manual intervention if needed.This launch represents a significant milestone for both Uber and WeRide, expanding the reach of autonomous vehicles in the Middle East and demonstrating the commercial viability of fully driverless robotaxis outside the US and China.","Uber and weride launched level 4 driverless robotaxis in abu dhabi, operating on yas island zones.

Premium Dining: Other high-view venues like The Meat Co charge a minimum spend of Dh5,000 for a lower terrace seat.

Fast Food, High Price: Even the casual spots get in on the action! You can expect to pay around Dh2,200 per person for a ""gold table"" (outdoor view) at places like Five Guys (unlimited burgers and shakes included!). Other casual dining outdoor spots like TGI Fridays start around Dh3,000.

The Small Catch: When booking a restaurant package, remember a critical detail: most restaurants on The Dubai Mall Promenade and Souk Al Bahar are dry venues, meaning they are unable to serve alcohol. Confirm your beverage package before you book if a celebratory drink is part of your NYE plan.
