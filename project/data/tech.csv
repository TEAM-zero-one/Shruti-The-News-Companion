NEW DELHI: India on Friday inked a $248 million contract with Russia’s state-owned Rosoboronexport (RoE) for procurement of 1,000 HP (horsepower) engines for its fleet of T-72 Tanks in “fully formed, completely knocked down and semi knocked down” conditions.“The deal also includes transfer of technology (ToT) from M/s RoE to M/s Armoured Vehicles Nigam Limited (or the Heavy Vehicles Factory) at Avadi, Chennai, for integration and subsequent licensed production of engines to boost the `Make in India' initiative,” a defence ministry official said.“The Russian-origin T-72s are the mainstay of the Army tank fleet, which at present are fitted with a 780 HP engine. Equipping the fleet of T-72 Tanks with 1,000 HP engines will enhance the battlefield mobility and offensive capability of the Army,” he added.Along with a fleet of 2,400 T-72 tanks, the Army has so far inducted 1,300 T-90S `Bhishma’ tanks of the 1,657 being produced by the Heavy Vehicles Factory under licence from Russia.The Army force is now also inducting 118 indigenous Arjun Mark-1A tanks , with 14 major and 57 minor “upgrades” to enhance firepower, mobility, endurance and protection, ordered for Rs 7,523 crore in Sept 2021. These 118 `improved’ tanks will add to the first 124 Arjun tanks inducted well over a decade ago.Then, there are the 354 indigenous light tanks for high-altitude warfare to be inducted under Project Zorawar for around Rs 17,500 crore. The need for such tanks, each weighing less than 25 tonnes with a high power-to-weight ratio as well as superior firepower and protection, has been driven home by the continuing almost four-year-long military confrontation with China in eastern Ladakh.","India inked a $248 million contract with russia’s state-owned rosoboronexport (roe) for procurement of 1,000 hp (horsepower) engines for its fleet of t-72 tanks.

Clove and Deadlock Receive Major Ability Adjustments for Better Balance



The newest patch from Valorant, Patch 10.04, shakes up the game for both Agents and gameplay. One of the major highlights is that there is a new agent in the Duelist category named Waylay, along with reworks for other characters in the form of Clove and Deadlock. Besides, two maps namely Ascent and Icebox join the map rotation fresh. At the same time, Abyss and Bind have been temporarily taken out from the competitive and Deathmatch queues.One of the most critical changes in this patch is Clove, an agent who has been overperforming in ranked matches. The goal is to better balance her abilities such that the other agents sharing her strength would be counted as a hero longer. Her Meddle ability just won't explode 1.3 seconds after activation; it will explode 0.75 seconds after it hits the ground. Ruse cooldown was increased from 30 to 40 seconds for better balance in high-stakes matches.In contrast, Deadlock has undergone an extensive overhaul. Her barrier mesh, once a signature attribute, would now cost 400 credits to use instead of being free as before. Also, GravNet has shrunk from 16 to 13 meters, and is now available with a 40-second cooldown as a signature ability. An extra audio cue has also been put into place to add clarity on when the net's effects are nullified by enemies to ensure that everybody understands what it entails.The other major updates for Iso have also included undercut charges cut down from two to one, with a price increase from 200 to 300 credits. The agent's ultimate, contingency, now features an alt-fire cast which allows localized wall movement at half speed. There is a double tap fix that will ensure Iso will produce an orb whenever one is required, making him even more powerful when facing an opponent in an ultimate duel.The Overdrive VFX of Neon has also been updated for further clarity while Tejo's Guided Salvo damage has been reduced from 70 to 65 as well as 50% damage to other objects that are not players. On the map front, Ascent and Icebox make a return to the competitive scene while Abyss and Bind are temporarily yanked. The change on Ascent has a bit of modification on the B Main wall in order to deny bullet proofing, giving Attackers a bit of safety as they approach the denied area.Aside from many other bug fixes, includes the fix to the problem where Neon may jiggly head upside down while sliding and the modification of Fade's Nightfall animation. VALORANT Patch 10.04 has been great, offering exciting new features along with critical changes being made for balance in competitive play. New and old players will find a refreshing experience as these changes are anticipated.",Clove and deadlock receive major ability adjustments for better balance.

But Not Everyone's Happy — Performance Issues and Missing Features

GTA 5’s ‘Enhanced Edition’ Update is Getting Mixed Reviews...

— F4SuperBugfan89 (@F4SuperBugfan89)



Rockstar just dropped the long-awaited GTA V Enhanced Edition for PC, and let’s just say — the streets of Los Santos are buzzing. But not everyone’s impressed. While some fans are losing their minds over the game’s new graphics, others are side-eyeing certain changes that have stirred up quite the debate.Over on Reddit, the reactions are all over the place. Many fans are praising the ray-traced global illumination (RTGI) feature, with one user saying they're— calling it a subtle but impactful touch to the game’s visual appeal.For those wondering what all the tech jargon means, a helpful commenter explained that global illumination works like ""bounce lighting"" — when light hits a surface, some of it scatters and reflects, giving the game a more realistic, immersive look. It’s a big leap from the old days when developers had to fake these effects manually.However, the hype train didn’t roll smoothly for everyone. Some fans quickly noticed performance issues, with a wave of complaints about lag and bugs — especially with character transfers. As of now, the update holds a ""mixed"" review status on Steam, reflecting the community's split opinion.One glaring issue that's ruffled feathers is the sudden removal of in-game text chat in GTA Online. Many players took to Reddit to express their frustration, with some speculating that it might be a temporary fix for technical problems. Still, for a game so reliant on communication for heists and missions, the absence of text chat feels like a step backward.Despite the rocky rollout, GTA V’s Enhanced Edition saw over 187,000 concurrent players on Steam shortly after its launch — proving that, love it or hate it, Los Santos still draws a crowd.What’s your take — a solid upgrade or a bumpy ride?

It's like he's speaking directly to us, the bewildered yet thoroughly entertained audience.But wait, there's more! This whole shenanigan is tied to the Grizzlies' drafting of Zach Edey .

It was a meme masterpiece, a perfect encapsulation of Edey's ""enforcer"" role, a role he's embraced with the tenacity of a man who's seen every Jackie Chan film ever made. Edey’s presence has been the equivalent of a human shield for Morant, just like the giant in the movie, a hilarious and effective dynamic.ALSO READ: Cleveland Cavaliers Tristan Thompson's Comments on Donald Trump's Bitcoin Reserve: Is He Right?

India Inc is striving to reimagine workplaces, championing inclusivity, diversity, and gender parity in a highly disruptive, tech-driven world to spark a pink edge.Companies are ramping up efforts to attract and retain women talent with targeted leadership programmes, cutting-edge AI upskilling, and enhanced flexibility that nurtures work-life balance. In this drive for a more equitable environment, equal opportunities have taken center stage - eclipsing salary and benefits as a defining priority for women-signaling a shift toward cultures that prioritise growth, fairness, and purpose.In the post-pandemic return-to-office (RTO) era, flexibility has become a lifeline for women balancing professional and personal demands. Over half of Indian employees - 52% - would leave a job lacking sufficient flexibility, according to Randstad Workmonitor Survey 2025. Women tend to place more importance on work-life balance, it adds.Viswanath P S, MD & CEO of Randstad India, a talent company, says, ""Women are actively seeking greater flexibility, meaningful career development, and upskilling opportunities, particularly in AI and emerging technologies. The demand for full-time remote work is also significantly higher among women.""A bunch of companies including TCS and Accenture offer flexible work options, while some like Meesho include hybrid work policies to promote better work-life balance.Govindraj M K, CHRO at Myntra, says, ""We provide additional flexibility through our MynVive: Myntra Ramp-back Programme, which offers new mothers and primary caregivers options offering extended flexibility, such as sabbatical leave for up to 24 weeks and the option to work at 50% capacity for three months post-maternity.""However, many companies are insisting on a strict return to office. Rituparna Chakraborty, co-founder TeamLease, cautions, ""The result will be that organisations that embrace AI to enable personalised learning, hybrid work and career paths, and flexible working will be able to attract and retain the best female talent.""As industries adapt to tech advancements, the demand for skills that align with innovation and adaptability has never been higher. As AI (artificial intelligence) and automation disrupt sectors, the workforce needs to be equipped with new tools to stay ahead of the curve.

Dubai’s luxury real estate market has evolved into one of the most sought-after investment destinations for ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs), who see the city as a hub for premium properties and a secure place to preserve and grow their wealth. Strategic government initiatives, long-term residency programmes, and an unmatched lifestyle have propelled Dubai to the forefront of the global luxury property market, drawing in investors from every corner of the world.H.E.Sultan Butti bin Mejren, Director-General of the Dubai Land Department (DLD), attributes this success to the city's investor-friendly policies. “Dubai remains at the forefront for global investors, positioning Dubai as the world's premier real estate destination and a byword for innovation, trust, and happiness”.One of the most significant drivers of Dubai’s booming property sector has been the Golden Visa programme, which offers long-term residency to investors purchasing property worth at least AED 2 million. The programme has reshaped investor behaviour, with many now favouring long-term ownership over short-term speculation.According to a report1 by fäm Properties, Dubai’s real estate market has had a record-breaking year. The year 2024 was an all-time peak of a high of 180,900 transactions touching a whopping AED 522.1 billion. Firas Al Msaddi, CEO of fäm Properties, added that 2024 was a remarkable year for Dubai’s real estate market with a growth in transaction volumes, despite global economic uncertainties.He added sale values in fact, broke historical records with strong rental demands and high luxury resilience.Peter May, Chief Operating Officer at Silkhaus, believes Dubai’s appeal lies in its economic and political stability, coupled with its business-friendly environment. “Dubai stands out as a stable, business-friendly hub with strong leadership, security, and a tax-efficient environment, making it a haven for investors seeking long-term growth,” he says. “Unlike many other global cities that are saturated or struggling with over-regulation, Dubai continues to offer a fresh landscape where high-net-worth individuals can build their portfolios without excessive restrictions.”Apart from this Dubai's government has also launched ambitious urban development projects to enhance the city's appeal. The Real Estate Strategy 2033 aims to increase property transaction values to AED 1 trillion ($272 billion) within a decade. This plan focuses on creating upscale communities through public-private partnerships, ensuring a steady supply of luxury properties to meet growing demand.Dubai’s reputation has evolved from being a hub for GCC and Russian investors to attracting a more global clientele. Alois Kugendran, CEO of Amaya & Co Real Estate, has seen this first-hand, in a conversation with TOI.com, he said “Dubai’s reputation as a safe, stable destination with world-class infrastructure and long-term residency incentives is driving this trend,” he says. “We’re seeing more European and North American buyers than ever before. Many of them are relocating, drawn not just by investment opportunities but by the city’s lifestyle, tax benefits, and business potential.”A report2 by Colliers International notes that Dubai's real estate sector has witnessed a surge in investment from family offices seeking diversification and long-term returns.A Henley Private Wealth Migration Report3 2023, added close to 4,500 millionaires relocated to the UAE in the same year. Not only that, according to a report by DIFC, Dubai ranked 1st in the MEASA region and among the world’s top 22 cities in terms of wealthiest population centers in 2023 with over 68,500 HNWIs.His Excellency Essa Kazim, Governor, of DIFC said in the report - “Dubai and DIFC have rapidly positioned themselves as the premier destination for family businesses worldwide. The exponential growth and expertise witnessed within the Centre underscores its pivotal role in shaping the landscape of family wealth.” DIFC is also making strides to push an increase in technology and innovation in the real estate sector. The financial hub has launched a new technology solution that enables third parties to access data on its real estate landscape. The report added that the initiative will contribute to the Dubai Real Estate Sector Strategy 2033 which aims to increase transactions, attract international investors, and position Dubai as one of the foremost property investment destinations.According to the Savills Prime Residential World Cities Index4, Dubai prime residential capital values saw a 6.4% rise in 2025. This has cemented the emirate’s status as a top global investment hub. The report added that there is a growing population and influx of HNIs and family offices in the UAE fuelling a high demand for prime residential properties.It added that Dubai is evolving as a luxury segment that in fact, is redefining the market’s understanding of ‘prime’, with its multiple ultra-luxury projects. Indian investors continue to be among the top three nationalities purchasing luxury properties in Dubai, drawn by zero capital gains tax, ease of inheritance planning, and high ROI potential.For Indian investors, Dubai provides significantly more value per square foot than major cities like Mumbai and Delhi. “Many of our Indian clients tell us that buying in Dubai makes more financial sense than in their home market,” Kugendran said. “They get better infrastructure, higher ROI, and access to a market that continues to appreciate.”Branded residences have become a defining feature of Dubai’s luxury property boom, with partnerships between developers and global brands drawing in wealthy investors looking for exclusivity. “Branded residences—offering a blend of luxury, exclusivity, and hotel-style management—are in high demand,” said Kugendran. “They provide not just prestige, but also hassle-free returns, which is something investors value.”At the same time, short-term rental investments have become a key part of many investors' strategies. May has observed that UHNWIs are no longer just looking for properties to own—they are looking for ways to make their investments work for them. “Short-term rentals offer greater liquidity, allowing investors to sell properties without the constraints of long-term tenancy agreements,” he explains. “This flexibility makes them a strategic asset, enabling investors to adapt quickly to market conditions while maximising returns.”Kugendran believes that Dubai’s rental market is one of the strongest globally. “There’s a huge demand for luxury short-term rentals, whether it’s from high-net-worth travellers, executives, or digital nomads looking for extended stays,” he says. “The yields in Dubai’s prime locations consistently outperform traditional rental markets in cities like London and New York.”With the city’s real estate market seeing record-breaking transactions, prime locations such as Palm Jumeirah, Dubai Hills Estate, and Downtown Dubai have become some of the most valuable addresses in the world.H.E. Sultan Butti bin Mejren has highlighted Dubai's real estate sector's resilience and growth, he said, ”The strong performance in the real estate sector indicates a trend that we expect to be sustained over the next year and beyond.”5Developers are responding to the growing demand with more exclusive, low-density developments that prioritise privacy, space, and sustainability. Kugendran has noticed a strong interest in sustainability-driven properties. “Luxury buyers today want more than just a big house—they want eco-friendly designs, energy-efficient systems, and developments that offer wellness-focused living,” he says. “Sustainability is no longer a niche trend; it’s becoming a requirement for high-end buyers.” Knight Frank Sustainability in Real Estate Report added luxury real estate in Dubai is no longer just about opulence; it’s about sustainability, wellness, and environmental responsibility, which are becoming key decision factors for high-net-worth investors.6For investors, the appeal of Dubai’s real estate market is also no longer just about capital appreciation but also about strong rental yields. May sees this as a major shift in how UHNWIs are approaching their investments. “Both capital appreciation and rental income are moving in the same direction. Property values continue to rise, while rental demand—particularly for short-term rentals—is outpacing supply, driving higher yields and increased ROI potential,” he says. “What makes Dubai unique is that investors don’t have to choose between growth and income—they can have both.”Dubai’s luxury real estate market is no longer just a haven for second-home buyers—it has become a centre for long-term wealth preservation, business expansion, and high-yield investments. As a city that continually reinvents itself, it offers something few other real estate hubs can: stability, exclusivity, and a future-ready investment landscape. For UHNWIs, the question is no longer whether to invest in Dubai—it is how much of their portfolio they should allocate to it.Click this link for more on Business in Dubai.SourcesIt is a part of a featured content series on Business in Dubai.","According to a report1 by fäm properties, dubai’s real estate market has had a record-breaking year.

Canadian Tire to close 17 Atmosphere stores in Western Canada amid restructuring,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canadian-tire-to-close-17-atmosphere-stores-in-western-canada-amid-restructuring/articleshow/118773776.cms,"Canadian Tire Corp. Ltd. will shut down 17 Atmosphere stores across Western Canada in the coming months as part of its restructuring strategy, the company announced Thursday. The closures, which include locations in British Columbia, are part of its Truth North plan , a four-year, $2 billion initiative aimed at streamlining operations and improving efficiency.The company, which also owns SportChek , Mark’s, Party City, and Pro Hockey Life, is shifting away from its holding company model to consolidate systems and data across its brands.“We will operate more efficiently and go to market more strategically, harnessing our banners and loyalty system to elevate our scale,” said Canadian Tire CEO Greg Hicks in a statement.Of the 17 Atmosphere locations set to close, 14 will be relocated within existing SportChek stores in a phased transition. However, the company has not specified which locations will be affected. British Columbia currently has 10 Atmosphere stores, including in West Vancouver, Coquitlam, Surrey, Langley, Nanaimo, Victoria, Kamloops, Kelowna, and Prince George, while Alberta has multiple locations in Calgary, Edmonton, Red Deer, and Banff.Canadian Tire is working to place affected employees in new roles but has not disclosed how many workers will be impacted. The company declined an interview, stating the move is intended to reduce redundancies and back-office costs.Beyond store closures, the company’s strategy includes optimizing SportChek’s retail footprint, expanding its loyalty program by adding brand partners, and increasing its Triangle Mastercard user base. It also plans to carry out up to $400 million in share buybacks , doubling its previous target of $200 million.As part of the transition, the leadership team is being restructured. Susan O’Brien, previously the chief brand and customer officer, will take on the role of chief transformation officer, while T.J. Flood, president of Canadian Tire’s retail division, will become COO. The company is also searching for a new chief commercial officer.RBC Capital Markets analyst Irene Nattel described the changes as “sensible,” stating in a note to investors, “If properly executed, the result should be closer connection to (Canadian Tire’s) customer base and a more effective approach to procurement and merchandising, in turn driving stronger revenue growth/profitability.”The announcement comes just weeks after Canadian Tire signed a nearly $1.3-billion deal to sell its Helly Hansen brand to Kontoor Brands, the owner of Wrangler and Lee.Hicks has recently warned that U.S. tariffs could impact the company’s financial outlook, stating that consumer spending had started recovering but could be “substantially erased” due to tariff pressures. Canadian Tire currently sources about 15% of its products from the U.S. and is exploring shifting 25-30% of those purchases to Canadian suppliers.","Canadian tire corp. ltd. will shut down 17 atmosphere stores across western canada.

Higher salaries, expanded job sectors

A boost for Indian talent

Singapore is opening new doors for foreign workers, and for Indians, this could mean better job opportunities and longer career stability in the city-state. The ministry of manpower (MOM) has announced a series of policy changes that will allow employers to hire and retain skilled foreign talent more easily—benefiting Indian professionals and laborers alike.From July 1, Singapore is scrapping the maximum employment period for work permit holders. Previously, foreign workers could only stay for 14 to 26 years, depending on their sector and country of origin. This means Indian workers in construction, shipyards, and process industries will now have the opportunity for long-term employment without arbitrary limits.Additionally, the maximum age for employment is rising from 60 to 63, allowing experienced workers to stay longer. For new applicants, the age cap is also increasing to 61, up from 50. These changes will particularly help senior professionals and skilled laborers from India continue working in Singapore for extended periods.The reforms also bring better pay. The qualifying salary for S Pass holders—who perform specialized roles—will rise to SGD 3,300 (Rs 2.04 lakh) from September. For mid-career professionals in their 40s, salaries could go up to SGD 4,800 (Rs 3 lakh). In financial services, the qualifying salary is even higher, starting at SGD 3,800.Moreover, the range of jobs open to non-traditional sources like India is expanding. From September, roles such as cooks, heavy vehicle drivers, and manufacturing operators will be added to the list—offering more avenues for skilled Indian workers to enter Singapore’s job market.Singapore’s economy relies on a mix of local and foreign talent. As manpower minister Tan See Leng stated, restricting foreign workers would hurt businesses and limit opportunities for locals. Over the past decade, while foreign employment grew by 38,000, local professionals, managers, and executives saw an increase of 382,000.With these new measures, Indian professionals, skilled laborers, and businesses will have a stronger footing in Singapore, ensuring a steady flow of jobs and economic ties between the two nations.","From july 1, singapore is scrapping the maximum employment period for work permit holders.

RIL share price : Reliance Industries (RIL) shares have experienced significant decline, dropping 25% from their peak of Rs 1,608.95 on BSE on July 8. Foreign institutional investors ' selling amid retail slowdown and weak refining margins has led to a Rs 5.4 lakh crore erosion in value. The stock's performance has lagged behind Nifty by 10% since January 2024, creating widespread negative sentiment, according to an ET report.Recent trading sessions show a 4% recovery in RIL shares, indicating possible value buying at lower levels. The sustainability of this recovery remains uncertain.Jefferies analysts consider current valuations excessively negative, pointing out that the market capitalisation suggests an enterprise value of $48 billion for RIL's retail division, substantially below the $106 billion valuation from its previous funding round.

Infosys work from office rules: Infosys, the second-largest software services firm in India, has issued a directive on Wednesday requiring its technology staff to comply with the work from office for 10 days monthly mandate, aiming to increase on-campus attendance. Infosys has implemented a new attendance system via a mobile application that mandates employees to be physically present at their designated office locations for at least 10 days monthly. The system will not automatically approve work-from-home requests, according to a senior staff member who requested not to be named.A colleague mentioned this requirement is primarily driven by project needs rather than departmental demands.Department heads at the Bengaluru-based organisation sent emails to their team members, instructing them to restrict their work-from-home requests starting March 10, according to sources who spoke to ET.Also Read | How will Elon Musk-led DOGE’s slashing of federal spending impact Indian IT companies? The email reportedly said: ""To support this, starting March 10, 2025, system interventions will be implemented to limit the number of work-from-home days that can be applied each month. These measures are designed to ensure compliance with the new hybrid work requirements while maintaining flexibility for employees.""A senior executive explained that this systematic approach aims to foster better team collaboration whilst maintaining workplace flexibility.The email further said: ""As you know, our hybrid work model expects employees to work from the office for at least 10 days a month, or as per business requirements, whichever is higher.""This directive specifically affects staff at job level 5 (JL5) and below, encompassing team leaders, software engineers, senior engineers, system engineers and consultants. Whilst JL6 and above positions, including managers, senior managers, delivery managers and senior delivery managers (excluding vice presidents), are not included in this mandate.Another staff member expressed concerns about the policy, noting that remote work had provided benefits in terms of reduced travel time and physical strain.

BENGALURU: Ten years ago, MNC IT companies boasted six women at the helm. Prominent leaders included Accenture India's chairman Rekha Menon, IBM's Vanitha Narayanan, HP's Neelam Dhawan, Capgemini's Aruna Jayanthi and Intel's Kumud Srinivasan. Back then, Meta (Facebook) was headed by Kirthiga Reddy. Several of these leaders managed firms with nearly 100,000 employees.Fast forward to today. MNCs remain steadfast in their commitment to increasing women leaders at the top. In contrast, despite higher representation of women at entry-level positions, women as leaders are still under-represented in Indian IT firms, with fewer examples at the top. Barring a handful of women in senior leadership roles, Indian IT companies look pale with poor representation of women in the C-suite. Wipro appointed Aparna Iyer as its CFO, while Suzanne Dann is the CEO of Americas 2. Infosys roped in Inderpreet Sawhney as its chief legal officer and chief compliance officer. Data shows that fewer women executives hold top management positions and report to the board in IT firms.MNCs, including global capability centres (GCCs), are taking the lead in promoting more women to senior leadership positions. India has 1,760 GCCs, with an increased focus on high-value services and ER&D. A Nasscom-Zinnov report showed that over the past five years, global roles in India expanded significantly, with more than 6,500 established positions. Interestingly, this included 1,100 women leaders holding global roles. Zinnov's data on GCCs showed that at the executive tier, women constitute 6.7% of the total workforce. The mid-level positions, with five-to-eight years of professional experience, are filled by 24.3% of women employees. Senior roles, which demand 9 to 12 years of experience, comprise 15.7% of the female workforce. GCCs employ 1.9 million people out of India's total tech talent pool of 5.8 million people.Lalitha Indrakanti, CEO of JLR Technology & Business Services India, said the difference between working in an IT services company and a GCC lies in depth of organisational understanding and expertise one develops over time. ""While policies for increasing women leadership pipeline are similar across both, GCCs offer greater stability, allowing women to stay in roles longer without shifting between client projects.""Karthik Padmanabhan, managing partner in tech consulting firm Zinnov, said the rise of women leaders in GCCs is being driven by structured interventions, targeted mentorship and a deliberate focus on increasing the contribution toward outcomes. ""India's GCCs have been instrumental in accelerating this shift, embedding gender diversity into core talent strategies, while aligning with global leadership frameworks,"" he said.MNCs have led the pack with several policy interventions to nurture promising women executives into senior leadership roles. These firms actively monitor their career advancement through mentorship programmes and encourage them to pursue international opportunities.Anuprita Bhattacharya, head of Merck IT Center (MITC), IT country head - India, said the growth of women in leadership has been 14.3% over the last five years. ""Beyond training and development, we ensure that women at Merck IT Centre gain real exposure - leading initiatives and engaging with influential leaders, both within the organisation and through our industry networks."" Sirisha Voruganti, CEO of Lloyds Technology, said, ""Our commitment to foster an inclusive workplace is exemplified through many initiatives, aimed at raising scopes for women.""","Mncs, including global capability centres (gccs), are taking the lead in promoting more women to senior leadership positions.

Walgreens to be bought by private equity firm Sycamore Partners,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/struggling-retailer-walgreens-to-be-acquired-by-sycamore-partners-in-10-billion-deal/articleshow/118777523.cms,"

Walgreens Boots Alliance has been acquired by private equity firm Sycamore Partners in a deal worth nearly $10 billion, as the retailer seeks to turn around its fortunes after years of financial difficulties but still couldn't do it.Announcing the deal on Thursday, the pharmacy company said Sycamore would pay $11.45 per share, with the potential for shareholders to receive an additional $3 per share under certain conditions. The agreement would take the company private, allowing it to restructure its business away from the pressures of Wall Street. Tim Wentworth, Walgreens Boots Alliance CEO said, “Throughout our history, Walgreens Boots Alliance has played a critical role in the retail healthcare ecosystem. We are focused on making healthcare delivery more effective, convenient and affordable as we navigate the challenges of a rapidly evolving pharmacy industry and an increasingly complex and competitive retail landscape.""The CEO further added that Sycamore will provide the company with the expertise and experience of a partner with a strong track record of successful retail turnarounds.The buyout deal values Walgreens at almost $24 billion when including debt, and Sycamore’s offer represents a nearly 30 per cent premium on its share price from December, when reports of a possible sale first surfaced.Walgreens has also been working to boost its finances, including suspending its quarterly dividend, ending a 90-year streak, and reducing its stake in drug distributor Cencora to free up cash for debt repayment.Ultimately, improving cash flow remains a top priority, whether the company stays public or goes private. ""Management has not been shy about its push to improve the cash flow generation profile as part of the turnaround plan,"" Leerink Partners analyst Michael Cherny noted in a February report.Founded in 1901, Walgreens has been a public company since 1927 but has faced growing challenges in recent years, due to low prescription reimbursement rates, rising costs, increasing theft, and price-sensitive customers shifting to cheaper alternatives. The company already began a restructuring process, including plans to close 1,200 of its roughly 8,500 US stores. This follows a previous downsizing, which saw it reduce its store count after acquiring parts of Rite Aid in 2018.Beyond store closures, Walgreens has been reviewing its US healthcare operations, including a potential sale of its VillageMD clinic business, which it had aggressively expanded. This move comes after the company’s shares lost nearly two-thirds of their value in 2023.Walgreens operates nearly 3,700 international stores in the UK, Mexico, Thailand, and Ireland. The buyout comes at a time of major shifts in the industry, with rival Rite Aid recently emerging from bankruptcy as a private company, while competitors like CVS, Walmart, and Kroger continue to dominate the US pharmacy market.","Walgreens boots alliance has been acquired by private equity firm sycamore partners in a deal worth nearly $10 billion.
