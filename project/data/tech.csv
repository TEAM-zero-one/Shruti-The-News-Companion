On Jan 29, India witnessed Isro's 100th rocket launch when GSLV-F15 rocket launched navigation satellite NVS-02. He urged people to observe National Science Day by spending “One Day as a Scientist”, which he said will foster curiosity among children and youth about science.On the country’s space sector achievements, Modi said, “Champions Trophy is going on these days and there is an atmosphere of cricket for everyone. We all know the thrill of a century in cricket. But today, I am not going to talk about cricket, rather I will talk about the wonderful century that India has made in space. Last month, the country was a witness to Isro's 100th rocket launch. This is not just a number, but it shows our resolve to achieve ever-new heights in space science. Our space journey started in a very normal manner. There were challenges in every step, but our scientists continued moving forward achieving victory over them.”“With time, the list of our achievements in space flights continues to grow longer. Be it building a launch vehicle, success of Chandrayaan, Mangalyaan and Aditya L1 or carrying out the unprecedented mission of sending 104 satellites into space in one go with one rocket. The ambit of Isro's success has been quite large. In the past 10 years, around 460 satellites have been launched, in which many satellites of other countries are also included,"" the PM said.On growing women’s power in the industry, Modi said, “The participation of women power has been continuously rising in the space sector. I feel very happy seeing that today the space sector has become a favourite of the youth. For our youth who want to do something thrilling and exciting in their life, the space sector is becoming an excellent option for them.""Speaking about National Science Day 2025, which will be celebrated on Feb 28, the PM said that the interest and passion of youth in science matters a lot. ""You try to spend one day as a scientist. You must visit places like a research lab, planetarium or space centre that day. This will increase your curiosity about science. Like space and science, India is rapidly making its mark in another field. That is AI (Artificial intelligence). I went to Paris to take part in an AI summit. There, people lauded India's strides in the field of AI,"" PM Modi said.He also mentioned a teacher from Telangana, Thodasam Kailash, who is harnessing AI technology in digital song and music to help preserve the tribal languages, including Kolami. His tracks are being liked a lot by the tribal people. ""People of India are second to none in adopting and using new technologies,"" he said.","Pm narendra modi hailed isro, saying it has hit the century in space.

around world

NEW DELHI: After the breakthrough in developing a hyperloop test track (422m) by IIT Madras with support from Indian Railways , the government is now planning development of a 50km corridor for commercial transport, said minister Ashwini Vaishnaw . It may be the longest hyperloop track in the world.""The first tube will go a long way in developing technologies. The time has come when after the first two grants of $1million each (nearly ₹9cr), the third grant of $1million will be given to IIT Madras for further developing the hyperloop project in a nice way. And once we see the commercial or rather pre-commercial where the product is ready, then within the railway set-up we will start the first commercial project. We will decide a site, which can be used for good commercial transportation of 40km-50km and then we will go for it,"" Vaishnaw said while addressing the closing ceremony of Asia's first Global Hyperloop Competition by IIT Madras.Sources said the test track for commercial operation will help railways assess viability of the technology. The hyperloop track can allow speeds of up to 1,200kmph. The successful development of the first test track, which was completed in Dec last year, will be the base for future development.Hyperloop systems are expected to dramatically reduce travel times between cities, offering an alternative to traditional rail and air travel. The hyperloop concept envisions high-speed, low-pressure pods travelling at speeds of up to 1,200 kmph.The hyperloop system was first conceptualised by Swiss professor Marcel Juffer in the 1970s. In 1992, Swissmetro SA was set up to develop this project, but it went into liquidation in 2009. At present, there are eight promising hyperloop projects in the world, including Virgin Hyperloop which has been actively testing its systems in Nevada. Canadian firm TransPod is also constructing a test track to validate their design.In an official statement, the railway ministry said IIT-Madras and railways will also work together on vertical take-off landing vehicles.","The government is planning development of a 50km corridor for commercial transport.

And the numbers they shared in terms of reduction in chemicals, improvement in water usage, and ultimately yield was phenomenal,” Nadella said.“One of the things it does is sensor fusion. We've been talking about it for decades. This is using geospatial data spatial temporal data from drones from satellites from soil all getting connected in real time, and then to apply AI to it and then translate it back into know, asking questions in there vernacular language,” Nadella added.“That's the stitching together. It's pretty phenomenal to see.”Musk's response comes days after Musk also responded to Nadella’s post on quantum computing chip.Nadella highlighted the breakthrough, stating, “We've created an entirely new state of matter, unlocked by a new class of materials— topoconductors-that enable a fundamental leap in computing.”Tesla CEO replied to Nadella,s post, “More and more breakthroughs with quantum computing ..."".","Microsoft ceo satya nadella shared a short clip of himself talking about how farmers in india are using artificial intelligence (ai) to improve the yield of their land.

Potential

spillover risk

Monitoring and

pandemic preparedness

A new bat coronavirus with the potential for animal-to-human transmission has been discovered by a team of Chinese researchers, raising concerns about possible future spillover events. The virus, named HKU5-CoV-2 , was found to use the same human receptor as SARS-CoV-2 , the virus responsible for Covid-19.According to the South China Morning Post, the study was led by Shi Zhengli , a renowned virologist known as ""batwoman"" due to her extensive research on bat coronaviruses.The research involved scientists from the Guangzhou Laboratory, Guangzhou Academy of Sciences, Wuhan University, and the Wuhan Institute of Virology . Their findings were published in the peer-reviewed journal Cell on Tuesday.The newly discovered virus belongs to the merbecovirus subgenus, which includes the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) virus. It is a new lineage of the HKU5 coronavirus, initially identified in Japanese pipistrelle bats in Hong Kong.The research found that HKU5-CoV-2 can bind to the human angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE2) receptor, the same receptor used by SARS-CoV-2 to infect human cells. ""We report the discovery and isolation of a distinct lineage (lineage 2) of HKU5-CoV, which can utilise not only bat ACE2 but also human ACE2 and various mammalian ACE2 orthologs,"" the scientists wrote.The study warned that bat merbecoviruses ""pose a high risk of spillover to humans, either through direct transmission or facilitated by intermediate hosts.""According to the researchers, HKU5-CoV-2 can bind to ACE2 receptors in multiple animal species, increasing the likelihood of interspecies transmission.Despite its potential for human infection, the researchers cautioned against exaggerating the threat. They noted that the virus’s efficiency in binding to human ACE2 is “significantly lower” than that of SARS-CoV-2. ""The risk of [HKU5-CoV-2] emergence in human populations should not be exaggerated,"" they said.Earlier this month, Cell published a study by researchers from the University of Washington in Seattle and Wuhan University, which concluded that while the HKU5 strain could bind to bat and other mammalian ACE2 receptors, it did not show ""efficient"" binding to human ACE2.However, Shi’s team countered that HKU5-CoV-2 appears to be better adapted to human receptors than its predecessor, lineage 1, and ""may have a broader host range and a higher potential for interspecies infection,"" South China Morning Post reported.Given the potential risks, the researchers focused on the need for further monitoring. The World Health Organization has already included merbecoviruses on its list of emerging pathogens for pandemic preparedness.Shi Zhengli, who played a key role in Covid-19 research, has previously denied claims that the Wuhan Institute of Virology was responsible for the pandemic.While the origins of Covid-19 remain debated, some studies suggest the virus originated in bats and jumped to humans through an intermediate host.","A new bat coronavirus with the potential for animal-to-human transmission has been discovered by a team of chinese researchers.

Ashneer Grover-led fantasy cricket platform CrickPe has shut down operations just two years after its launch, according to an Inc42 report. The platform, which was the first product from Grover’s startup Third Unicorn , was introduced ahead of the 2023 Indian Premier League (IPL) season. However, it has now stopped launching new contests.A message on the CrickPe app reads, “We’ve had an amazing innings together. While we won’t be rolling out new contests on the app anymore, this is just a timeout.”Grover told the publication that CrickPe will be shut down by the end of 2024 due to regulatory challenges and taxation issues. He said:“CrickPe has been halted end 2024 as we are not keen on the space given misplaced connotation of gambling with gaming in India and imposition of 28% GST last year. We had great fun with the space but feel it’s best for incumbents like Dream11 and others and the economics of the business does not have scope for incentivising the cricketers out of the game pot – which was our initial idea.”A key challenge for CrickPe was the 28% GST on online real-money gaming, introduced on October 1, 2023, replacing the previous 18% GST on platform fees for skill-based games.Grover has been a vocal critic of this move. He once posted on X (formerly known as Twitter) that the 28% GST had ""murdered the online gaming industry”. The post was later deleted.While the Supreme Court recently put a temporary hold on GST proceedings against 49 real-money gaming companies, the uncertainty surrounding taxation and regulations appears to have played a role in decision to halt CrickPe.Despite ceasing new contests, CrickPe still allows users to withdraw their winnings.",28% gst on online real-money gaming one of the reasons behind shutdown of crickpe.
