Experts call for more transparency in skincare labels,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/experts-call-for-more-transparency-in-skincare-labels/articleshow/118743794.cms,"Industry experts are highlighting the need for clearer ingredient labeling in skincare products. Many brands use terms like ""clean"" and ""natural"" without standardized guidelines, making it difficult for consumers to assess product effectiveness.Dr Tanvi Tijoriwala, a Canada-based naturopathic doctor, noted that key ingredients, such as vitamin C, need to be present in specific concentrations to be effective. ""For vitamin C to truly benefit the skin , it should be between 10–20%. Some products contain much less but still make the same claims,"" she explained.Dermatologist Dr Rachel Simmons added that while brands are required to list ingredients in descending order, they don’t have to specify exact percentages. ""This can make it challenging for consumers to know how much of an active ingredient they’re actually getting,"" she said.Dr Tanvi Tijoriwala also suggested that customers look beyond front-label claims and read ingredient lists carefully. ""A good practice is to check where active ingredients appear on the list. If they're near the bottom, they may not have much impact,"" she advised.As awareness grows, experts believe more transparency could help consumers make informed choices while encouraging brands to adopt clearer labeling practices.","Industry experts are highlighting the need for clearer ingredient labeling in skincare products.

Boston Bruins Eyeing Bigger Return from Flames at NHL Trade Deadline Amid Brandon Carlo Speculations,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/boston-bruins-eyeing-bigger-return-from-flames-at-nhl-trade-deadline-amid-brandon-carlo-speculations/articleshow/118737459.cms,"Image Via Getty Images

A Brandon Carlo To Flames Deal Could Create A Bigger Opportunity

With the NHL trade deadline approaching, the Boston Bruins have been in the limelight with their recent activities. Just after the Bruins traded Trent Frederic and Max Jones to the Edmonton Oilers for draft picks and prospect Max Wanner, they would surely be eyeing a bigger fish. With Carlo supposedly on the radar of the Calgary Flames, Boston could set itself for a much larger return that would greatly benefit the roster into the future. This retooling type of move indicates that the team plans to enhance its roster without slowing down its long-term goals.Brandon Carlo's worth on the trade market is rising with increased speculation, especially with two years remaining on his contract with a very manageable cap hit of $4.1 million. The 27-year-old American defenseman has been a steady presence on the Bruins' blue line, making him a tempting sweetener in a deal for teams seeking defensive stability. With strong interest reportedly being expressed by the Calgary Flames to acquire Carlo, this may lead to quite a larger return relative to Frederic's worth.With several teams still in the hunt for the playoffs, this year's trade market is definitely on the side of the sellers. Boston's recent dealings with the Oilers, which saw them acquire two draft picks and a promising prospect, indicate that teams are ready to pay well for valuable assets. Should the Bruins act upon that market trend and trade Carlo, he could attract high picks and prospects that could greatly bolster the franchise's efforts in the offseason.With the Flames looking to shore up their back end with an eye toward the playoffs, the Bruins would have all the more leverage in trading Carlo. Such a deal fits neatly into Boston's short-term retooling plan while preserving guys like David Pastrnak, Brad Marchand, and Charlie McAvoy for greater glory in the future.Also Read: NHL fans express concern as Brad Marchand takes devastating hit during Bruins vs Penguins showdown The Bruins are using a calculated strategy for the day of the trade, balancing short-term goals and long-term projects. A trade of Brandon Carlo could bring the package of picks and prospects valuable to their offseason roster upgrade. There will be no total rebuild; instead, the Bruins are positioning themselves strategically to retool and be competitive. With many building blocks already in place, Boston's front office will wisely prioritize the accumulation of assets to set the stage for sustained success. Just before the deadline, the fans can expect the Bruins to make a series of calculated moves that favor their present as well as future.","Brandon carlo's worth on the trade market is rising with increased speculation.

When Billionaire Ankur Jain Married Erika Hammond: A Love Story You Never Knew About



Forget Succession drama, we've got a real-life power couple story that's more epic than a Marvel Phase finale. Picture this: a tech titan , a billionaire with a Midas touch, and a WWE knockout queen. It's like a script straight out of a rom-com directed by Christopher Nolan , with a dash of The Wolf of Wall Street hustle. Enter Ankur Jain , the mastermind behind Bilt Rewards , a company that's the Avengers: Endgame of loyalty programs, valued at $3.1 billion. Before he was conquering the fintech world, he was swiping right at Tinder, honing his product skills like a digital Don Draper. Think of him as Tony Stark , but instead of building suits, he's building billion-dollar empires. And let’s not forget, his father, Naveen Jain, was a Microsoft executive and billionaire, so the entrepreneurial force is strong with this one.But here's where it gets truly Bridgerton meets WrestleMania. Ankur's heart was captured by Erika Hammond, a former WWE NXT diva with the kind of charisma that could sell out Madison Square Garden. Their meet-cute? At Rumble Boxing, where Erika was serving sweat-drenched, knockout punches and Ankur, well, was clearly floored. Imagine him, a tech wizard, falling for a wrestling goddess while she’s mid-jab cross. It’s a scene worthy of a standing ovation.ALSO READ: When WWE Fans Mourned Rey Mysterio’s Death: The Mysterio's Scandalous Mystery Their whirlwind romance culminated in a wedding that redefined ""destination.""

From his Wharton days to building a $1.2 billion net worth, Ankur Jain has shown he’s not just a tech whiz, but a master of the game.

Dubai’s luxury real estate market has evolved into one of the most sought-after investment destinations for ultra-high-net-worth individuals (UHNWIs), who see the city as a hub for premium properties and a secure place to preserve and grow their wealth. Strategic government initiatives, long-term residency programmes, and an unmatched lifestyle have propelled Dubai to the forefront of the global luxury property market, drawing in investors from every corner of the world.H.E.Sultan Butti bin Mejren, Director-General of the Dubai Land Department (DLD), attributes this success to the city's investor-friendly policies. “Dubai remains at the forefront for global investors, positioning Dubai as the world's premier real estate destination and a byword for innovation, trust, and happiness”.One of the most significant drivers of Dubai’s booming property sector has been the Golden Visa programme, which offers long-term residency to investors purchasing property worth at least AED 2 million. The programme has reshaped investor behaviour, with many now favouring long-term ownership over short-term speculation.According to a report1 by fäm Properties, Dubai’s real estate market has had a record-breaking year. The year 2024 was an all-time peak of a high of 180,900 transactions touching a whopping AED 522.1 billion. Firas Al Msaddi, CEO of fäm Properties, added that 2024 was a remarkable year for Dubai’s real estate market with a growth in transaction volumes, despite global economic uncertainties.He added sale values in fact, broke historical records with strong rental demands and high luxury resilience.Peter May, Chief Operating Officer at Silkhaus, believes Dubai’s appeal lies in its economic and political stability, coupled with its business-friendly environment. “Dubai stands out as a stable, business-friendly hub with strong leadership, security, and a tax-efficient environment, making it a haven for investors seeking long-term growth,” he says. “Unlike many other global cities that are saturated or struggling with over-regulation, Dubai continues to offer a fresh landscape where high-net-worth individuals can build their portfolios without excessive restrictions.”Apart from this Dubai's government has also launched ambitious urban development projects to enhance the city's appeal. The Real Estate Strategy 2033 aims to increase property transaction values to AED 1 trillion ($272 billion) within a decade. This plan focuses on creating upscale communities through public-private partnerships, ensuring a steady supply of luxury properties to meet growing demand.Dubai’s reputation has evolved from being a hub for GCC and Russian investors to attracting a more global clientele. Alois Kugendran, CEO of Amaya & Co Real Estate, has seen this first-hand, in a conversation with TOI.com, he said “Dubai’s reputation as a safe, stable destination with world-class infrastructure and long-term residency incentives is driving this trend,” he says. “We’re seeing more European and North American buyers than ever before. Many of them are relocating, drawn not just by investment opportunities but by the city’s lifestyle, tax benefits, and business potential.”A report2 by Colliers International notes that Dubai's real estate sector has witnessed a surge in investment from family offices seeking diversification and long-term returns.A Henley Private Wealth Migration Report3 2023, added close to 4,500 millionaires relocated to the UAE in the same year. Not only that, according to a report by DIFC, Dubai ranked 1st in the MEASA region and among the world’s top 22 cities in terms of wealthiest population centers in 2023 with over 68,500 HNWIs.His Excellency Essa Kazim, Governor, of DIFC said in the report - “Dubai and DIFC have rapidly positioned themselves as the premier destination for family businesses worldwide. The exponential growth and expertise witnessed within the Centre underscores its pivotal role in shaping the landscape of family wealth.” DIFC is also making strides to push an increase in technology and innovation in the real estate sector. The financial hub has launched a new technology solution that enables third parties to access data on its real estate landscape. The report added that the initiative will contribute to the Dubai Real Estate Sector Strategy 2033 which aims to increase transactions, attract international investors, and position Dubai as one of the foremost property investment destinations.According to the Savills Prime Residential World Cities Index4, Dubai prime residential capital values saw a 6.4% rise in 2025. This has cemented the emirate’s status as a top global investment hub. The report added that there is a growing population and influx of HNIs and family offices in the UAE fuelling a high demand for prime residential properties.It added that Dubai is evolving as a luxury segment that in fact, is redefining the market’s understanding of ‘prime’, with its multiple ultra-luxury projects. Indian investors continue to be among the top three nationalities purchasing luxury properties in Dubai, drawn by zero capital gains tax, ease of inheritance planning, and high ROI potential.For Indian investors, Dubai provides significantly more value per square foot than major cities like Mumbai and Delhi. “Many of our Indian clients tell us that buying in Dubai makes more financial sense than in their home market,” Kugendran said. “They get better infrastructure, higher ROI, and access to a market that continues to appreciate.”Branded residences have become a defining feature of Dubai’s luxury property boom, with partnerships between developers and global brands drawing in wealthy investors looking for exclusivity. “Branded residences—offering a blend of luxury, exclusivity, and hotel-style management—are in high demand,” said Kugendran. “They provide not just prestige, but also hassle-free returns, which is something investors value.”At the same time, short-term rental investments have become a key part of many investors' strategies. May has observed that UHNWIs are no longer just looking for properties to own—they are looking for ways to make their investments work for them. “Short-term rentals offer greater liquidity, allowing investors to sell properties without the constraints of long-term tenancy agreements,” he explains. “This flexibility makes them a strategic asset, enabling investors to adapt quickly to market conditions while maximising returns.”Kugendran believes that Dubai’s rental market is one of the strongest globally. “There’s a huge demand for luxury short-term rentals, whether it’s from high-net-worth travellers, executives, or digital nomads looking for extended stays,” he says. “The yields in Dubai’s prime locations consistently outperform traditional rental markets in cities like London and New York.”With the city’s real estate market seeing record-breaking transactions, prime locations such as Palm Jumeirah, Dubai Hills Estate, and Downtown Dubai have become some of the most valuable addresses in the world.H.E. Sultan Butti bin Mejren has highlighted Dubai's real estate sector's resilience and growth, he said, ”The strong performance in the real estate sector indicates a trend that we expect to be sustained over the next year and beyond.”5Developers are responding to the growing demand with more exclusive, low-density developments that prioritise privacy, space, and sustainability. Kugendran has noticed a strong interest in sustainability-driven properties. “Luxury buyers today want more than just a big house—they want eco-friendly designs, energy-efficient systems, and developments that offer wellness-focused living,” he says. “Sustainability is no longer a niche trend; it’s becoming a requirement for high-end buyers.” Knight Frank Sustainability in Real Estate Report added luxury real estate in Dubai is no longer just about opulence; it’s about sustainability, wellness, and environmental responsibility, which are becoming key decision factors for high-net-worth investors.6For investors, the appeal of Dubai’s real estate market is also no longer just about capital appreciation but also about strong rental yields. May sees this as a major shift in how UHNWIs are approaching their investments. “Both capital appreciation and rental income are moving in the same direction. Property values continue to rise, while rental demand—particularly for short-term rentals—is outpacing supply, driving higher yields and increased ROI potential,” he says. “What makes Dubai unique is that investors don’t have to choose between growth and income—they can have both.”Dubai’s luxury real estate market is no longer just a haven for second-home buyers—it has become a centre for long-term wealth preservation, business expansion, and high-yield investments. As a city that continually reinvents itself, it offers something few other real estate hubs can: stability, exclusivity, and a future-ready investment landscape. For UHNWIs, the question is no longer whether to invest in Dubai—it is how much of their portfolio they should allocate to it.Click this link for more on Business in Dubai.SourcesIt is a part of a featured content series on Business in Dubai.","According to a report1 by fäm properties, dubai’s real estate market has had a record-breaking year.

Elon Musk questioned by Tesla shareholders as stock declines for sixth consecutive session: “share five things you did for Tesla shareholders this week…”,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/share-five-things-you-did-for-tesla-shareholders-this-week-elon-musk-questioned-by-tesla-shareholders-as-stock-declines-for-sixth-consecutive-session/articleshow/118688836.cms,"Elon Musk called out by investors as Tesla’s stock struggles continue

“Please share five things you did for Tesla shareholders this week. Or are you working remotely? Asking for all of us.”

Tesla stock performance and financial concerns

Increased competition in the EV market from legacy automakers such as Ford, GM, and global competitors like BYD.

Production and delivery challenges, with supply chain disruptions affecting Tesla’s output.

Leadership distractions, as Musk continues to divide his attention across multiple ventures, raising concerns about Tesla’s long-term strategic direction.

Regulatory scrutiny over Tesla’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) technology and ongoing legal challenges related to product safety.

Elon Musk’s expanding commitments raise concerns

Tesla investors have expressed growing frustration as the company’s stock continues to decline, marking its sixth consecutive session of losses. Shareholders are increasingly holding CEO Elon Musk accountable, questioning his recent actions and decision-making. The backlash follows Musk’s controversial demand for U.S. federal employees to justify their salaries by listing five accomplishments each week—a strategy he previously implemented at Twitter. Now, investors are turning the tables, demanding to know what Musk has done for Tesla shareholders as the stock tumbles.The discontent highlights broader concerns over Musk’s leadership, particularly his divided focus across multiple ventures, including SpaceX, Neuralink, The Boring Company, and his latest role as the U.S. government’s ""efficiency czar."" The ongoing criticism has sparked debates about his commitment to Tesla, a company once celebrated as the frontrunner in the electric vehicle (EV) industry.Amid Tesla’s stock decline, shareholders have taken to Musk’s own social media platform, X (formerly Twitter), to air their grievances. Celebrity photographer Jerry Avenaim was among those calling out Musk, posting:Accompanying the post was a stock performance graph showing Tesla’s downward trend. The sarcastic remark directly referenced Musk’s demand that federal employees justify their roles with weekly accomplishment lists, which had drawn criticism from government workers.Tesla investors are now challenging Musk using his own words, asking him to justify his leadership as stockholders witness losses. The growing unrest among investors signals a shift in sentiment, as many once ardent supporters now express skepticism over Musk’s priorities and Tesla’s future.Tesla’s stock has faced significant volatility since the start of 2025, with sharp declines raising concerns among investors. While Musk remains a visionary figure in the tech and automotive industries, recent market performance suggests that investor confidence may be wavering.Several factors have contributed to Tesla’s stock drop, including:Market analysts have warned that Tesla’s declining stock could further erode investor confidence unless Musk reaffirms his commitment to the company’s growth and stability.One of the key points of contention among shareholders is Musk’s involvement in multiple ventures beyond Tesla. His leadership roles at SpaceX, Neuralink, The Boring Company, and X have raised questions about whether he is stretched too thin.Additionally, Musk’s new role as the U.S. government’s ""efficiency czar"" has sparked debate. Appointed under Donald Trump’s administration, Musk has been tasked with improving governmental operations. However, critics argue that this political involvement further diverts his focus from Tesla at a critical time.Musk’s controversial management style has also drawn criticism. His push for extreme work culture at Twitter, mass layoffs, and controversial statements on social media have led some investors to question whether similar turbulence could impact Tesla’s stability.","Elon musk called out by investors as tesla’s stock struggles continue to decline.

Explainer: How Trump’s tariff war may raise prices for US consumers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/explainer-how-trumps-tariff-war-may-raise-prices-for-us-consumers/articleshow/118739081.cms,"Image credits: AP

Which industries are most at risk?

How much could these tariffs cost the US economy?

Are these tariffs permanent?

How do tariffs work?

How soon will consumers feel the effects?

Why is Trump imposing these tariffs?

Have tariffs like this been used before?

What happens next?

President Donald Trump’s long-threatened tariffs have taken effect, launching the US into a full-scale trade war with China, Canada, and Mexico. These tariffs impose a 25% tax on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 20% tariff on Chinese goods, prompting swift retaliatory measures from all three countries. As a result, the cost of everyday goods—ranging from electronics and appliances to food and fuel—is expected to rise, hitting both businesses and consumers hard.While Trump argues these tariffs will protect American industry and bring back manufacturing jobs, experts warn they could lead to higher prices, supply chain disruptions, and economic losses. Wendong Zhang, an assistant professor at Cornell University, cautions that “all of the economies involved in the tariffs will see a loss in their real GDP and increasing consumer prices in general.” With Canada and Mexico imposing billions in counter-tariffs and China targeting US agriculture, the economic impact could be significant. Here’s a breakdown of the key questions surrounding these tariffs and their consequences.Also read: 'Get ready': Donald Trump announces tariffs on agriculture imports to start on April 2 Trump has imposed a 25% tariff on imports from Canada and Mexico and a 20% tariff on Chinese goods. These tariffs apply to a wide range of products, including electronics, auto parts, food, and consumer goods.China, Canada, and Mexico have all announced retaliatory tariffs on US products:China: Up to 15% tariffs on US farm exports, including soybeans, pork, beef, and chicken.Canada: Tariffs on $100 billion worth of American goods over 21 days.Mexico: Tariffs on US products to be announced, with a potential focus on agriculture and industrial goods.Also read: 'Dumb' trade war turns serious: After China, Canada files WTO complaint against US tariffs Higher tariffs mean higher prices for everyday items. Electronics, groceries, gasoline, and appliances could all see price hikes. Target CEO Brian Cornell warned that tariffs will put “meaningful pressure” on profits and consumer spending.Yes, retailers and manufacturers that rely on imported goods will face higher costs, which will likely be passed on to consumers. Best Buy CEO Corie Barry noted that the company’s supply chain is “highly global, technical, and complex,” making price increases “highly likely.”Retail – Electronics, clothing, and everyday consumer goods may become more expensive.Automotive – Car prices may rise due to supply chain disruptions.Agriculture – US farmers are at risk as China cuts back on imports of soybeans, pork, and corn.Food & Beverage – The price of fruits, vegetables, whiskey, and tequila could increase.Zhang estimates a 0.4% GDP loss, equating to over $100 billion. Canada and Mexico could suffer even greater losses due to their smaller economies and reliance on US trade.It’s uncertain. If the US economy suffers significantly, Trump may be forced to roll back tariffs. However, he has also threatened additional tariffs on countries like India and the EU, targeting more products such as computer chips and pharmaceuticals.A tariff is essentially a tax on imports, which businesses must pay when bringing goods into the US Importers pass these costs onto consumers, resulting in higher prices. While Trump argues that foreign exporters “shoulder the cost,” economic studies suggest the burden falls largely on American businesses and shoppers.For perishable goods like fruits, vegetables, and meat, price increases could happen within days or weeks. Cornell noted that shoppers could see prices for Mexican avocados rise “as early as in a few days.” Other goods, like electronics and appliances, may take longer to reflect tariff-related price hikes.Trump claims the tariffs will:Protect American manufacturing by making foreign imports more expensive.Raise revenue to help pay for tax cuts.Serve as a negotiation tool to pressure trade partners.Yes, but not at this scale. The US had high tariffs until the 1930s, but after the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act contributed to the Great Depression, trade policies shifted toward free trade agreements. Trump’s tariffs mark the highest US tariff levels since 1943.The global economy is in a state of uncertainty. If tariffs remain in place, inflation could rise, supply chains may be reshaped, and businesses may adjust by shifting production away from China, Mexico, or Canada. However, as Cornell put it, “things are unfolding so quickly… we don’t want to overreact to one day and one headline.”(With inputs from agencies)","President donald trump has imposed a 25% tax on imports from canada and mexico and a 20% tariff on chinese goods.

‘False’ FASTag wallet toll deduction? Here’s what NHAI is doing,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/false-fastag-wallet-toll-deduction-heres-what-nhai-is-doing/articleshow/118677800.cms,"FASTag users sometimes get toll deduction messages even when their vehicles are parked at home.

‘False FASTag toll deduction ’: The National Highways Authority of India ( NHAI ) has taken strict action against incorrect FASTag wallet deductions, penalising toll collectors in approximately 250 instances.FASTag users sometimes get toll deduction messages even when their vehicles are parked at home or haven't crossed toll plazas. Officials attribute this to toll operators' errors in vehicle number entry, particularly when FASTag becomes unreadable, or when individuals carry tags in their wallets.IHMCL , the highways authority's toll management body, now levies a Rs 1 lakh fine per violation in such cases. According to a TOI report , this substantial penalty has resulted in a 70% reduction in such incidents.Currently, IHMCL receives about 50 legitimate complaints monthly, compared to 30 crore FASTag transactions across national highway toll plazas.Users have reported false toll deductions on social media platforms and through formal complaints to IHMCL. ""Customers facing false deductions can file a complaint by calling 1033 or emailing falsededuction@ihmcl.com and each case is thoroughly investigated. And if the complaint of such deduction or incorrect manual transactions is established, chargebacks are issued to the customer immediately. Additionally, a Rs 1 lakh penalty is imposed on the toll operator responsible,"" said a senior IHMCL official.Also Read | Turnaround from importer to exporter! India now shipping Apple product components to China & Vietnam The official explained that incorrect vehicle number entry by toll operators during manual electronic transaction processing remains the primary cause of these false deductions.A FASTag serves as a rechargeable, prepaid tag that enables vehicles to navigate through toll gates without stopping, utilising RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology. The system facilitates automatic toll fee deductions from a connected prepaid account, which users can control via FASTag applications. This electronic tag, attached to the vehicle's windscreen, establishes communication with toll plaza scanning equipment.NHAI implemented FASTag, making it compulsory for all vehicles. This electronic toll collection system has transformed toll payments across India by significantly reducing queue times, decreasing fuel usage, and minimising person-to-person contact at toll booths.","Fastag users sometimes get toll deduction messages even when their vehicles are parked at home.

How will Elon Musk-led DOGE’s slashing of federal spending impact Indian IT companies?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/how-will-elon-musk-led-doges-slashing-of-federal-spending-impact-indian-it-companies/articleshow/118727017.cms,"Analysts suggest that DOGE's jurisdiction primarily covers federal contracts, whilst Indian IT firms predominantly work with state and local governments.

The cancellation of federal contracts by the US Department of Government Efficiency 's ( DOGE ), under Elon Musk 's leadership, might affect consulting-focused technology firms working on discretionary US government projects. However, Indian IT companies are expected to face minimal impact from these changes.According to the Everest Group, the Indian IT services sector receives a small fraction of annual US federal expenditure, comprising less than 2% of its yearly revenue. For the Indian IT industry, valued at over $280 billion, the exposure to US federal contracts remains below $6 billion, says an ET report.Everest Group vice president Prashant Shukla noted, ""In cases where Indian service providers have direct exposure to federal contracts, protective contractual clauses might require the US government to establish a special case for termination, such as termination for cause.""Also Read | ‘You are better off…’: Zerodha's Nithin Kamath shares SIP mantra amidst stock market crash doom and gloom Analysts suggest that DOGE's jurisdiction primarily covers federal contracts, whilst Indian IT firms predominantly work with state and local governments, thus remaining largely unaffected by DOGE's decisions.HFS Research data indicates that the US federal government allocates approximately $60 billion annually for consulting services.Despite Wipro and US-based Cognizant maintaining substantial consulting operations, with the latter's workforce primarily based in India, their exposure to US federal contracts remains limited. Analysts anticipate any impact on these companies to be negligible.The US federal budget for 2025 has allocated $75 billion towards IT implementation at civilian agencies to enhance government service delivery. The President's budget includes an additional $75 million for the technology modernisation fund, introducing an innovative funding approach to government IT utilisation.Despite short-term uncertainties, Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, partner at tech growth advisory firm Catalincs, anticipates that DOGE's initiatives will stimulate significant federal government technology expenditure, benefiting global technology organisations.Companies with Indian heritage in IT services that have established robust public services operations stand to gain, along with organisations that have developed local talent and centres in the US through various means, according to Ramamoorthy. He additionally identifies prospects for small and medium-sized IT service providers.Also Read | Tesla India entry: Why Donald Trump has said it would be ‘very unfair’ for Elon Musk’s Tesla to set up a factory in India The establishment of a centralised technological framework within DOGE for monitoring spending impact, redistributing budget for infrastructure upgrades, system modernisation, utilising analytics and AI for operational enhancement, whilst building cyber resilience will enhance efficiency and innovation, he noted. This development could create opportunities for Indian IT sector.Phil Fersht, CEO and chief analyst at HFS, indicated that alongside the Big 4 consultancies - KPMG, PwC, EY and Deloitte - DOGE's initiatives might adversely affect Accenture Federal Services, IBM, Booz Allen, General Dynamics and others.""Most of this work encompasses overall IT strategy and transformation infrastructure development, integration, data management, cloud migration and cybersecurity,"" Fersht stated, noting that Indian outsourcing companies' limited exposure might result in reduced impact.","The indian it services sector receives a small fraction of annual us federal expenditure, comprising less than 2% of its yearly revenue.

MUMBAI: Volumes in the cash and the derivatives segments of the market have dropped by up to 25% during the Jan-Feb months compared to last year, thanks mainly to a bad market and Sebi's stricter regulations for the derivatives segment that came into force last November.

Danish co ECCO bets on premium shoes demand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/danish-co-ecco-bets-on-premium-shoes-demand/articleshow/118746604.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Danish family-run footwear company ECCO seems to have found a sweet spot in India, leveraging on the rising demand for premium sneakers and the growing popularity of golf in the country.Labelled as an aspirational golf footwear brand globally, the euro 1.6 billion company plans to focus on the top 2.5% of the population, avoiding the mass-market sneakers, Patrick Iversen, regional director of South East Asia and Pacific, ECCO told TOI in an interview.The growing popularity of sneakers has been fueled by Gen-Z's influence and the post-Covid shift to casual wear globally and in India, featuring a wide spectrum from luxury designer collaborations to premium and affordable options.""As a family-owned company, we take a long-term view when it comes to India. While we are keen to establish a strong presence here, we will evaluate our progress over a number of years rather than taking a short-term perspective. Currently we have six stores, but most of them have only recently opened. Our goal is to expand to 25 stores by the end of next year. It takes time to understand consumer sentiment, and we want to invest heavily in the brand through marketing, and other initiatives,'' Iversen said.Though ECCO, owned by the Toosbuy family, entered India in 2019, its expansion was initially stymied by the Covid pandemic. However, witnessing a significant 5x growth in consumer demand, the company is now aggressively planning to expand its retail and online presence, reinforcing its positioning as a leading premium footwear brand (priced around Rs 25,000).ECCO aims to have 25 stores by the end of next year. ""Golf is a small but a growing market with 150,000 registered golfers. We are the number 1 premium brand. We believe also there is a sweet spot in the quality footwear market that is untapped..We do not want to really stick ourselves in the sneakers or value brands' game,"" he added.Other major golf shoe brands in India include FootJoy, TaylorMade and ColeHaan.ECCO's strategy aims to tap into metro and tier 1 cities coupled with its own D2C channel, and other e-commerce platforms. Around 35% of sales come from tier 2 and 3 cities.It sells in over 80 markets globally, with its largest markets being China, Russia, and the US. The golf footwear segment contributes a quarter of its worldwide sales.","Danish family-run footwear company ecco seems to have found a sweet spot in india.
