NEW DELHI: An NRI’s praise for India after returning home following an eight-year gap has become viral.Investor Alok Jain wrote on X that a friend from New York had recently visited him. According to Jain, the visitor was struck by the energy in the country and how fast India appeared to be growing.“An outsider’s perspective can be so different from our own,” Jain wrote, comparing it to how people living here may see the country.In his post, Jain said his friend was particularly surprised by how affordable many things in India were. He mentioned medical care, transport, internet and mobile services.The visitor compared these with costs in the US. According to Jain, his friend ""pays $600 for mobile and data at his house Pays $30k for health insurance for 4!! Per annum Pays 2 percent as property taxes per year..!!""Jain added that while air quality was better in the US, many good things were happening in India.The post drew a range of responses from social media users. One person wrote that many of their friends living in Bengaluru preferred it to New York City.Another user commented that from an outsider’s point of view, India’s main problems came down to a lack of civic sense. ""I am an outsider and I can say that everything wrong with the country has to do only with lack of civic sense among the people,"" he wrote.Someone who said they had lived in the Bay Area and were currently based in New York, agreed that phone bills and insurance costs in the US was high, but said salaries were also much higher, making direct comparisons difficult.The user added that property taxes varied by state and often fund services like public schools and clean roads. They said India stood out in areas such as access to medical care for those who can afford it, digital public services, and the availability of affordable physical labour.","Investor alok jain wrote on x that a friend from new york had recently visited him.

"Government unveils Rs 44,700 cr shipbuilding push to boost domestic capacity",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-unveils-rs-44700-cr-shipbuilding-push-to-boost-domestic-capacity/articleshow/126206538.cms,".

NEW DELHI: The shipping ministry has notified the guidelines for two major shipbuilding initiatives with an outlay of Rs 44,700 crore, aimed at boosting India’s shipbuilding capacity.The two schemes include the Shipbuilding Financial Assistance Scheme (SBFAS), with a corpus of Rs 24,736 crore, and Shipbuilding Development Scheme (SbDS), with an allocation of Rs 19,989 crore. These schemes are expected to provide a strong policy push to revive shipbuilding activity, attract investments and strengthen India’s maritime ecosystem.Under SBFAS, the government will provide financial assistance ranging from 15% to 25% per vessel, depending on the category of ships built. The scheme offers graded incentives for small normal, large normal and specialised vessels, with disbursement linked to clearly defined construction milestones and backed by security instruments. Incentives for series orders have also been included to encourage scale and efficiency.Under Shipbuilding Development Scheme (SbDS), greenfield shipbuilding clusters will receive 100% capital support for common maritime and internal infrastructure through a 50:50 Centre–state special purpose vehicle, while existing shipyards will be eligible for 25% capital assistance for brownfield expansion of critical infrastructure such as dry docks, shiplifts, fabrication facilities and automation systems.“These guidelines create a stable and transparent framework that will revive domestic shipbuilding, boosting forward and backward linkage amping ‘Make in India’ initiative, enable large-scale investment and build world-class capacity, positioning India as a major maritime nation on the path to Viksit Bharat and Aatmanirbhar Bharat,” port and shipping minister Sarbananda Sonowal said on Saturday.A key feature of SBFAS is the proposed National Shipbuilding Mission, which will ensure coordinated planning and execution of shipbuilding initiatives. The scheme also introduces a Shipbreaking Credit Note, under which ship owners scrapping vessels at Indian yards will receive a credit equivalent to 40% of the scrap value, linking ship recycling with new ship construction and promoting a circular economy. Over the next decade, SBFAS is expected to support shipbuilding projects worth about Rs 96,000 crore and generate employment.The SbDS focuses on long-term capacity and capability creation, including establishment of an India Ship Technology Centre to support research, design, innovation and skills development. The scheme also includes a Credit Risk Coverage Framework, offering govt-backed insurance for pre-shipment, post-shipment and vendor-default risks to improve project bankability and financial resilience.","The shipping ministry has notified the guidelines for two major shipbuilding initiatives with an outlay of rs 44,700 crore.

It then captures the separation of the L110 liquid core stage and the jettisoning of the payload fairing, before concluding with the successful separation of the BlueBird Block-2 satellite into Low Earth Orbit.The stunning visuals were recorded during Isro’s successful commercial launch of the next-generation US communication satellite for AST SpaceMobile earlier in the day. The 6,100 kg satellite was placed into its intended orbit at an altitude of about 520 km, approximately 15 minutes after launch.The 43.5-metre-tall LVM3 lifted off at 8.55 am after the completion of a 24-hour countdown.

Sami Zayn WWE salary and contract earnings

Sami Zayn’s wife on the most important match of his life: Elimination Chamber 2023 Diary

Originally named Rami Sebei, Sami Zayn has made a name for himself as one of the most respected and consistently pushed stars in the WWE Universe. Zayn has been a model of longevity, character work, and stable placement on premium live events, and his stability in that regard has equated to financial security. Industry-wide estimates have his individual net worth in the low millions as of the year 2025, primarily from his WWE contract and associated revenue streams like brand endorsements and deals.Khadija Sebei, wife of Zayn, lives under a very low profile, not being in any public business or entertainment business. It means any public appraisal of the couple's fortunes turns primarily on Zayn's professional earnings (no apparent records of independent commercial income linked to her name per se). Thus, their joint fortune is a poor reflection of the value the wrestler makes over a career, not of two parallel portfolios of income.Sami Zayn likely earned a WWE contract commensurate with his status as an invaluable veteran today who is not necessarily a marquee star. His annual WWE salary is estimated by various industry trackers in the range of $350,000 to $500,000. This number generally consists of a base salary that is guaranteed, bonuses that are based on performance, and pay that is based on premium live events and overseas tours.While it is rumored that emerging talent is on developmental deals, Zayn would be able to negotiate contracts that he has been earning with a consistent presence on television for years. When he is utilized in the many squad storylines and championship programs in a given year, or at the main event level for Pay-Per-Views, his earnings go up. Another benefit is that Zayn has built long-term sustainability as opposed to short-term surges.Sami Zayn also makes money off of merchandise royalties, which still plays an important role for veteran talent, on top of his WWE contract. Recurring revenue all year long comes from T-shirts, collectibles, and special event merchandise associated with major storylines. He has also ventured into limited media and entertainment work, including TV and streaming appearances, as additional sources of income.When all of the combined sources and standout earnings room are combined, responsible estimates place Sami Zayn's net worth at roughly $2 million in 2025. Aside from reportedly landing a three-year modelling contract with the major American brand this year, all fatigue to Khadija Sebei has proven to be a speculative wage, so combined, they can both expect a net worth in the ballpark of $2 million to $2.5 million at the most, to allow space for private investments and debts of others.Also Read: IShowSpeed’s latest YouTube drop features WWE legend Randy Orton","Sami zayn likely earned a wwe contract commensurate with his status as an invaluable veteran today.

Wayne Gretzky’s most famous cars: From Porsche to Rolls-Royce

Wayne Gretzky's WIFE, Children, House, Cars, Net Worth 2024 and More

Wayne Gretzky's wide range of vehicle collection, luxury cars, very few supercars, and performance units showed the same accuracy and elegance that characterized his superb NHL career. Although Wayne Gretzky was never a person to flaunt his lifestyle, reports coming from very reliable sources state that he once had a collection of luxury cars that more than quietly became the icons of the automotive world. Every automobile associated with The Great One mirrored the exceptionality, story, and very strong personal touch instead of ostentatious luxury.Unlike many famous people, Wayne Gretzky was very particular about the cars in his garage. He did not use up a lot of vehicles; instead, he picked the ones that had the attributes of art, power, and historical importance. These cars underwent a transfer of ownership from time to time, but always found their way back to the auction houses because their asking price would be instantly elevated due to the connection with the most popular name in hockey.The 1989 Porsche 911 Turbo Cabriolet was one of the first highpoints and the one that Wayne Gretzky bought brand new.The car was painted in Linen Grey Metallic with the complete grey leather interior and became famous when Wayne Gretzky signed the passenger-side sun visor. Automotive auction sources later confirmed its presence at the Barrett-Jackson Scottsdale auction before it went online, where its mileage and condition kept attracting collectors.Luxury cars came in when the 2005 Bentley Continental GT, which was finished in Ebony Black and later coated in custom matte black, was the next to enter the scene. Reports from the industry have it that the car by Dirty Bird Concepts underwent nearly $60,000 worth of upgrades, which included custom wheels and was thus rendered as one of the most visually attractive Bentley models attached to a sports celebrity.Performance lovers often mention Gretzky's possession of two Ford GT Heritage Edition models from 2006 as the ultimate proof of his performance orientation. They both had the famous Gulf Oil colors and the number 99, which stood for Wayne Gretzky jersey. As per the listings from RM Sotheby’s and Bring a Trailer, one of the cars was sold in 2023 for more than $500,000, and the other did not meet the reserve price despite receiving a very high bid.The 1993 Rolls-Royce Corniche Convertible remains the most iconic car, a present from the ex-owner of the team, Bruce McNall, after Wayne Gretzky had exceeded the NHL's all-time goal record. When this car was again sold in 2024, it was priced at over a million, thus securing its status as a legend.Wayne Gretzky’s car collection was not measured by the number of cars—it was the legacy that was important. Each car represented a story of success, moderation, and classy quality, perfectly describing the career of The Great One. His automotive choices reflected restraint, heritage, and enduring excellence beyond hockey.Also Read: Cale Makar net worth 2025: NHL achievements, Career, contracts, prize money, endorsements and more","The 1989 porsche 911 turbo cabriolet was one of the first highpoints and the one wayne gretzky bought brand new.

How much Gayle Benson's assets are worth

How their wealth stack up

Also Read:

Robert Kraft and Gayle Benson are two of the NFL's most prominent owners. They are also two of the richest persons in all of American sports. They both own well-known franchises and have a lot of authority, but the ways they made their money and became rich are very different. Here's a closer look at how their net worths compare and what makes their billion-dollar businesses unique.With a net worth of $13 billion, Robert Kraft is one of the richest owners in professional sports. He made a lot of money before he played football. He got through the Kraft Group, which is a holding company that owns businesses in sports, real estate, private equity, and paper and packaging.Kraft paid $172 million for the New England Patriots in 1994. At the time, it was the most money ever spent for an NFL franchise. During the time he owned the Patriots, they created a modern dynasty, winning six Super Bowls with Tom Brady and Bill Belichick. That success over time made the franchise worth a lot more, putting it toward the top of the NFL.The New England Revolution is a Major League Soccer team owned by Kraft. He also owns important real estate, such as Gillette Stadium and the developments around it.He has also spent a lot of money on famous entertainment and media companies. These assets make sure that Kraft's wealth isn't just focused on how well the team does, but also on a lot of other things that are vital for the company's long-term prosperity.With a net worth of $7.9 billion, Gayle Benson is one of the richest women in the world who owns sports clubs. She got famous after her husband Tom Benson died in 2018 and she took over leadership of the New Orleans Saints (NFL) and New Orleans Pelicans (NBA).Benson, on the other hand, didn't make most of her money from huge firms like Kraft did. She has a lot of money since she owns franchises, makes wise investments, and has a background in interior design and property remodeling, which helped her launch her business. She also puts money into enterprises like Dixie Brewing Company and horse racing with thoroughbreds.Benson has told the Saints and the Pelicans to focus on stability, community ties, and preparation for the long run. This has kept their values high even when things have altered on the field.Robert Kraft has a big financial advantage because his net worth is around $5 billion more than Gayle Benson's. Kraft has an advantage because he has been growing in the private sector for decades and has a lot of investments outside of sports. Benson, on the other hand, is part of a newer group of owners whose wealth is more closely tied to the value of their franchises and their historical assets.Kraft and Benson are two of the most well-known owners in the NFL, yet their money is different. Kraft's empire shows how to plan for the future and how big a corporation can go. Benson's fortune shows how to pass on wealth and take care of it. They all indicate that there are many different paths to reach to the top of owning a professional sports franchise.","Robert kraft and gayle benson are two of the nfl's most prominent owners.

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon musk has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

Mizkif net worth 2025 and how his streaming career shaped his earnings

Image Via Instagram





Mizkif has always remained one of the most popular names in online streaming circles with his unpredictable content, amazing ability to connect with his audience, and high-profile career changes. Moving on towards the end of the year 2025, his finances continue to be in the headlines with his high-profile career changes. Whether it’s a shift in platforms or a departure from organizational roles, Mizkif has become a name not associated with a linear career path, hence his net worth being a constant point of discussion.While exact figures are difficult to verify, there are several Internet estimates that say Mizkif is still in solid financial standing despite all of the highs and lows. Where once his income could be traced back to one specific area or industry, his career has become so diverse that his net worth is more of akind of deal, encompassing years of successful streaming, recognition as a brand, and an assortment of skill sets for adapting to an ever-shifting market landscape that is particularly challenging for creators like Mizkif to navigate successfully.As of 2025, Mizkif is reportedly estimated to have a net worth ranging from 4 million dollars to 6.5 million dollars, although some conservative estimates put it slightly lower than that. Although there is a considerable gap in these estimates due to discrepancies regarding calculations of platforming or spending, most people agree on where he got most of his money, which was presumably back when he was streaming.Streaming has continued to be a steady stream of income for him. He has, through the years, drawn income through subscription, ad revenue, and donations. Despite quitting Twitch to join Kick, it will be fair to say that many of his fans followed him, which is an important factor in ensuring a steady income. Deals probably followed, which enhanced income, even if figures are not made public.In addition to live streaming, Mizkif earns additional income from sponsorships, merchandise sales, and his channel on YouTube. In most cases, these additional sources of income tend to create financial stability for most of these influencers. Even though he does not have leadership positions within large corporations anymore, he owes that experience to his financial structure.All things considered, Mizkif's net worth in 2025 is indicative of his professional growth and success. In terms of his participation in the streaming industry, he has been changing. Nonetheless, his ability to sustain his fan base and various sources of income has guaranteed his ongoing financial success. Despite varying net estimates, Mizkif is undoubtedly one of the wealthiest people who came from the streaming industry.Also Read: Adin Ross confirms person allegedly hit by Clavicular’s Tesla Cybertruck is alive",Mizkif is reportedly estimated to have a net worth ranging from 4 million dollars to 6.5 million dollars.

Adin Ross explains FaZe Clan exits as GameSquare stake dispute while Richard Bengtsone denies involvement







FaZe Clan is in the middle of another big shake-up. The famous esports and creator group has seen many well-known members leave at the same time. Fans are confused and want answers fast. The biggest question is simple: who owns FaZe Clan now, and why are creators quitting together? Right now, GameSquare is the only owner of FaZe Clan. This comes after a long year of changes, buybacks, and exits at the top. As the exits happened, streamer Adin Ross shared his side of the story during a livestream.He claimed the issue was about money and ownership, not drama. At the same time, former FaZe leader Richard Bengtsone, also known as FaZe Banks, stepped in to clear his name. He said he had nothing to do with the recent exits. Here is what happened, step by step.FaZe Clan was started over 15 years ago by Richard Bengtsone. He led the group for years and became the face of the brand. That changed in 2023, when GameSquare bought FaZe Clan in an all-stock deal.In June 2024, Bengtsone returned by buying back 25% of FaZe Clan from GameSquare. Many fans thought this meant stability was back. But the return did not last long.In March 2025, Bengtsone’s company, Faze Media, sold its stake in FaZe Esports. This move gave GameSquare full control again.A few months later, in July 2025, Bengtsone stepped down as CEO. From that point on, GameSquare became the sole owner of FaZe Clan.Soon after, creators began leaving. On Christmas, QTCinderella, JasonTheWeen, StableRonaldo, Lacy, Adapt, and Silky all posted the same message on X:“Left @FaZeClan”As questions grew, Adin Ross spoke during a livestream. He claimed the exits were linked to a late demand for ownership shares. Ross said:“They never signed that 20% initially. They [GameSquare] come after them a year and a half later and then ask for the 20%…. That’s in the wrong. ‘Cause if your intention was to sign these guys for 20% of FaZe, they probably would’ve all done it.”He added:“But now, you wait until they’re big, have millions of followers, so why would they sign the contract? You can’t put a deal in their fking faces at this point.”Many fans then wondered if FaZe Banks was involved in this. Bengtsone responded on X and shut that down. He wrote that he had “nothing to do” with the situation, said he had moved on, and added that he would help if asked.Also Read: Viral Video Shows Clavicular And N3on Attacked With Red Liquid As Past Crash Livestream Resurfaces Amid Ongoing Kick Ban","Faze clan is in the middle of another big shake-up.

Ex-Rockstar developer has a GTA 6 warning: ‘If the game is delayed again…',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/gaming/ex-rockstar-developer-has-a-gta-6-warning-if-the-game-is-delayed-again/articleshow/126189019.cms,"Former Rockstar developer Mike York warns that further delays to Grand Theft Auto 6 could kill public interest. He believes Rockstar is meticulously polishing the game to meet immense expectations, but prolonged waits risk alienating fans. York anticipates a November 2026 release, citing it as an optimal period for sales ahead of the holiday season.

“We’ve been waiting so long for

GTA 6

already that if there was to be another delay, people will probably stop caring about its release even more. If

Rockstar

Games delay GTA 6 again then the hype around the game will die down almost completely. Right now, nobody is searching for GTA 6. Everyone knows there’s no news, there’s nothing to talk about… There’s a point to where you delay something so much that you start to make people angry.”

“People aren’t itching to find new details or a latest leak anymore, they’re over it. They are thinking, ‘it will come out when it comes out’, as they’re so burnt out from thinking it will come out soon and then it doesn’t… And then they’re like, ‘OK, whatever…’”

Why Ex-Rockstar developer thinks Rockstar has been delaying the game

“If I know Rockstar Games, and I know the guys over there, one of the reasons for the delay in releasing GTA 6 is because they’re trying to make it look as best as it can possibly be. They’re polishing stuff.

I don’t think they’re completely finished with the game, given how much is on the line and how big everyone’s expectations are for it.”

“I think the game will be released in November 2026 as it’s a good time for the game to come out for Rockstar for multiple reasons to sell video games. If you want to sell a big amount of video games then that’s the perfect time for GTA 6 to come out with it being a month before Christmas. Usually companies only delay these things once or twice when they need to, so I think it will come out around that time,”





Former Rockstar Games developer Mike York has a critical warning for the Take-Two-owned gaming studio. He has warned that the hype and public interest around Grand Theft Auto 6 will “die down” almost completely if the game faces any more delays. In an interview with Esports Insider (as seen by Dexerto), York said:York cited fan reactions showing growing frustration, with some saying they “don’t even care anymore” because repeated delays keep letting them down.he added.The game’s delay from May to November 2026 even caused anger in Poland’s parliament, with an opposition lawmaker calling the postponement “a huge scandal” during a session.Explaining Rockstar’s reason behind GTA 6 delay, York said:York believes Rockstar is aiming to meet very high internal standards and may not feel it has reached that level yet.York noted.Till date, Rockstar has released two official trailers of the highly anticiapted game which have confirmed that GTA 6 is set in a modern Vice City. The game will feature dual protagonists, deeper RPG systems, realistic physics, new heist tools and a more evolving open world.","Former rockstar developer mike york warns that further delays to grand theft auto 6 could kill public interest.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu was recently asked by an X (formerly Twitter) user why there is no talk about Arattai now?

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s joinery from Manipal





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him. The IIT rejection redirected his life towards a path only few could have imagined and which eventually led him to become the CEO of Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable companies. Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software. Nadella further added that like many of friends he also viewed IIT as the pinnacle of academic achievement. But when he failed to secure admission, Nadella faced a setback that could have easily defined his future. Instead, it became the catalyst for a different journey.Nadella described IIT as “the holy grail” for middle-class students, acknowledging the weight of expectations. Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there. However, all these experiences helped him in building adaptability which later went ahead and defined his leadership style.Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992, after working at Sun Microsystems. Over, the next two decade he rose steadily through the ranks and the became the Microsoft CEO in 2014. When Nadella became the CEO, the company was facing a lot competition from Apple, Google and Amazon. However, under his leadership, Microsoft reinvented itself and it now a market valuation of $3.54 trillion.Nadella has often said that “only in America would someone like me get the chance to prove himself rather than be typecast based on the school I attended.”","Microsoft ceo satya nadella once shared his experience of how not going to iit which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him.
