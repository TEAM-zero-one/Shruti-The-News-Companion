"HC bins Roche's injunction plea, allows generic version of only drug for SMA",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hc-bins-roches-injunction-plea-allows-generic-version-of-only-drug-for-sma/articleshow/124441574.cms,"A division bench of Delhi high court Thursday rejected the appeal of pharma giant, Roche, seeking an injunction against Indian pharma company Natco Pharma launching a generic version of Risdiplam, the only available drug to treat a rare genetic disorder, spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). This comes as a major relief for Indian SMA patients.Govt's one-time aid of Rs 50 lakh for patients of rare diseases was not enough to cover even a year's treatment using Roche's patented version of Risdiplam, but at Natco's price for the generic version of the drug, treatment cost could be covered for 10-16 years.In March this year, a single-judge bench of Delhi HC rejected Roche's injunction plea against Hyderabad-based Natco Pharma in a patent infringement dispute related to Risdiplam. Roche's patent expires only in March 2035. However, Natco applied for a patent for an improved process for the preparation of Risdiplam and intermediates in Sept 2022. The court had ruled Natco had prima facie raised credible challenges to the validity of Roche's patent and ruled in favour of Natco.Several public health groups had opposed Roche seeking a permanent injunction against Natco, arguing that Roche's patent infringement lawsuit against Natco prioritised profits over patients' access to affordable treatment, potentially violating India's National Rare Disease Policy.Roche's patented medicine costs roughly Rs 6 lakh a bottle. An individual with a body weight of over 20kg needs roughly 2.5-3 bottles per month, or 30-36 bottles per year. Roche gives two bottles for free if you buy one, and so the patient would have to pay about Rs 60-72 lakh per year for treatment, unaffordable for most patients in India. Drug costing experts peg the cost of producing the drug at roughly Rs 3,000 for a year's supply.In April, Natco revealed in a ""legal update regarding Risdiplam launch in India"" that the ""company has decided to price the product (Risdiplam) at Rs 15,900"" per 60mg bottle, reducing the price by as much as 97%. This would bring down the cost to less than Rs 5 lakh per year. Bulk buying by govt could bring down the price to Rs 10,000 per bottle, which could bring the cost down to Rs 3.1 lakh per year, said health activists. The financial assistance for patients with rare diseases was increased to Rs 50 lakh in Sept 2024. At Natco's price, those living with SMA would be able to afford treatment for up to 16 years.The Working Group on Access to Medicines and Treatment welcomed HC's decision and said it highlighted harmful effects of patent evergreening, which could delay access to affordable medicines and lead to unnecessary litigation. It reaffirmed that access to lifesaving drugs should not depend on one's ability to pay.","A division bench of delhi high court thursday rejected the appeal of pharma giant, roche, seeking an injunction against indian pharma company natco pharma launching a generic version of risdiplam.

Shannon Sharpe’s sexually explicit texts with the young OnlyFans model show a very different side of the NFL legend



Shannon Sharpe reached a settlement with the OnlyFans model despite denying such accusations



Shannon Sharpe, the NFL legend, had a lot going on in his career as a host when things came crashing down in April 2025 after he was accused of sexual assault by a young OnlyFans model. Shannon Sharpe, the multi millionaire, was sued for a whopping $50 million by the woman as his fans got to see the sexually explicit conversations he has had with the woman.As Shannon Sharpe found himself involved in a scandalous legal mess, his legal team released texts exchanged between him and the young OnlyFans model to prove that the two were in a “consensual” relationship.In one of the texts released by Shannon Sharpe’s legal team, the young OnlyFans model texted him, “mhmmm u still have my handcuffs. I want like some hardcore bdsm action tho. feeling kinda freaky lately.”Another text from 11th August 2024 showed that the OnlyFans model texted Shannon Sharpe, “i’ll let you make it hang wherever u want daddy but ONLY if you take me out and treat me good…”This prompted Shannon Sharpe to respond with, “Deal. I crave ur p—y [Doe]. That’s my p—y now.”A third text from 23rd November 2023 showed that the young woman wrote, “only if you put that baby gravy in me, then u can do whatever u want to me.… i literally ate so much food i look like I’m pregnant with ur big black baby.”The young OnlyFans model’s legal team has alleged that while the two were in a “rocky consensual relationship”, Shannon Sharpe reportedly ended up sexually assaulting her a few times.Back in April 2025, Shannon Sharpe’s legal team issued a statement that read as, ""Mr. Sharpe categorically denies all allegations of coercion or misconduct — especially the gross lie of 'rape' — and will not submit to what he sees as an egregious attempt at blackmail…”The statement added, “He stands firmly by the truth and is prepared to fight these false claims vigorously in court…”Months later, in July 2025, Shannon Sharpe ended up settling the legal matter as he paid $20 million to the young woman but he has not issued a statement about it, as he continues to work on his popular podcasts after being fired by ESPN.Also Read: Shannon Sharpe’s alleged demand before meeting OnlyFans model raises eyebrows amid his $20M settlement with her",Shannon sharpe was accused of sexual assault by a young onlyfans model.

The truth behind why Giants let Saquon Barkley leave and Eagles benefited



How Giants’ financial strategy became Eagles’ biggest win



Saquon Barkley & More On Facing the New York Giants

The New York Giants once had their franchise running back in Saquon Barkley , a player who defined their offense and gave them hope through difficult seasons. But in today’s NFL , running backs rarely receive franchise-level treatment. The Giants proved that when they refused to match a $12 million offer, allowing Barkley to join the Philadelphia Eagles, a move that soon came back to haunt them.Barkley’s first season in Philadelphia couldn’t have gone better. He ran for 2,006 yards in 2024, sitting out Week 18 and still finishing among the league’s elite. His success proved that the Giants’ former star wasn’t the problem — the system around him was. New York’s offense struggled to protect its quarterback or open running lanes, while Barkley thrived behind the Eagles’ dominant offensive line.The reason the Giants let Saquon Barkley walk may surprise fans; it came down to money. On HBO’s Hard Knocks, Giants GM Joe Schoen explained, “We’ve gotta upgrade the offensive line, and you’re paying Daniel Jones $40 million. It’s not to hand the ball off to a $12 million back.”In short, the team chose financial balance and positional priorities over keeping their star running back.That decision reflects a modern NFL trend — running backs, no matter how talented, are viewed as replaceable. Teams hesitate to invest heavily in a position seen as short-lived and injury-prone. But Barkley’s 2024 season challenged that logic, proving that a true game-changer at running back can still redefine an offense.The Giants believed $12 million was too much for one player, but for the Eagles, it was a bargain. Barkley’s move not only boosted Philadelphia’s rushing attack but also strengthened their grip on the NFC East. Meanwhile, the Giants were left searching for an offensive identity — one they might have had if they had kept their star.In the end, the Giants’ decision was about more than money. They chose cap management over proven production. And as Barkley dominated for their biggest rival, it became clear that the $12 million they refused to spend might have been the best investment they never made.Also Read: Ravens QB Lamar Jackson injury update: Expected return and impact on Baltimore’s 2025 Season","Giants let saquon barkley walk for $12 million.

Scrutiny of third-party placements

Restrict employment-based green cards







The Donald Trump administration is pushing for a major overhaul of the H-1B visa program, going beyond the initial shock of the $100,000 fee that is now mandatory for all companies that want to file H-1B petition to hire staff from foreign countries. The proposals, formally listed in the Federal Register under the title of 'Reforming the H-1B Nonimmigrant Visa Classification Program' include several technical aspects which will impact the hiring of Indians.Department of Homeland Security, in its proposed draft, said: “The specialty occupation definition also clarifies that although the position may allow for a range of qualifying degree fields, each of the fields must be directly related to the duties of the position.”This modifies the softening that was done by the Biden administration to mean that there must be a logical connection between the degree and job duties. The Trump administration emphasizes direct relation, instead of mere logical connection. This would restrict who can be hired for which role.DHS plans to review and potentially narrow which employers and positions are exempt from the annual cap, affecting nonprofit research organizations, universities, and health care institutions that currently benefit from exemptions, Newsweek reported.Companies that place H-1B workers at other firms’ worksites, a common practice in the technology and consulting sectors, will come under more scrutiny.More scrutiny of companies that previously violated wage or labor condition rules.This may stop employers use the O-1A visas and national interest waivers to hire high-skilled foreign nationals. O-1A visas are for individuals with an extraordinary ability in the sciences, education, business, or athletics (not including the arts, motion pictures or television industry).The visa fee hike threw the IT companies into disarray initially, as companies rushed to call back all H-1Bs to the US. But the administration later clarified that it was for new petitions and now the fee has got legally challenged. Tech startups will have to hire American graduates as they cannot possibly pay $100,000 for foreign hirings but companies like Nvidia will not have much difficulty. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said his company will keep sponsoring H-1Bs and bear all related costs.","Trump administration is working on new immigration restriction rules.

Recently, Mahindra took to social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) to reveal that he has downloaded the Arattai app, prompting a response from Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu. Launched in 2021, Arattai—meaning “chat” in Tamil—was initially seen as a niche side project. But in the wake of AI anxieties, spyware scandals, and scrutiny of Big Tech, its pitch as a “spyware-free, made-in-India messenger” has struck a chord with users. The app’s rise was fueled by endorsements from government officials, including Union Education Minister Dharmendra Pradhan, who urged Indians to adopt indigenous platforms under the Aatmanirbhar Bharat initiative.Mahindra Group chairman and industrialist Anand Mahindra recently gave a public shoutout to Zoho’s messaging app Arattai.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has an important and surprising piece of advice for young people who are dreaming of entrepreneurial success. Bezos said ‘Go work at McDonald’s.’ As reported by Fortune, in a recent interview, Bezos stressed on the importance of early work experience especially in the fast-paced, customer-facing environment. “I always advise young people: Go work at McDonald’s,” Bezos said. “You learn responsibility. You learn how to show up. You learn how to deal with people. You learn how to hustle.”For those unaware, Bezos started Amazon out of his garage in 1994.

He emphasised that such small roles are necessary as they instill skill like discipline, resilience and the ability to handle pressure. These are the traits that many Gen Z entrepreneurs may overlook in their rush to build startups.The comments by Bezos come at a time when debate is growing over the value of traditional work experience versus the allure of instant digital success. With platforms like TikTok and YouTube offering rapid fame and monetization, Bezos’ advice serves as a reminder that grit and consistency still matter.Jeff Bezos also stressed that the working environments like McDonald’s exposes Gratification.

In the rapidly evolving world of AI-powered content, Elon Musk has taken a bold step forward. On October 5, 2025, he unveiled Grok Imagine Version 0.9, a major update to his AI platform designed to generate text, images, and videos with unprecedented speed, accuracy, and realism across multiple creative formats, including virtual reality environments and interactive storytelling. This launch comes just days after OpenAI’s Sora 2 release on September 30, intensifying the competition in AI video generation, creative technology, and immersive digital experiences.Musk’s announcement underscores his ambition to transform both the entertainment and gaming industries through generative AI, while also sparking debate about the potential limitations, job displacement, societal impact, and ethical considerations of AI-generated content.Grok Imagine 0.9 introduces several cutting-edge improvements that make AI content generation faster and more versatile than ever. Musk detailed these features on X (formerly Twitter):These upgrades highlight Musk’s goal of creating a multi-functional AI platform capable of producing movies, short videos, and interactive media at scale.Musk’s vision extends beyond video and image creation. In a recent X post, he revealed that his xAI game studio plans to release a “great” AI-generated video game before the end of 2026.A shared clip demonstrated a rudimentary first-person shooter, reminiscent of popular titles like Call of Duty, showcasing the potential of AI in gaming.To further this initiative, xAI is actively hiring a Video Games Tutor, offering $45–$100 per hour to train Grok to produce “engaging, fun, and innovative video games.” The role emphasises AI-assisted game design, including accurate annotations, iterative testing, and fostering interactive entertainment. This development aligns with industry trends. Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney predicts that AI prompts will allow small development teams to create games on the scale of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, unlocking entirely new genres and gameplay experiences previously impossible without AI.Despite the excitement, many industry experts remain cautious about AI’s creative capabilities. Michael “Cromwelp” Douse, publishing director at Larian Studios, emphasized that AI cannot replace human leadership, vision, or storytelling. According to Douse, AI-generated content may lack the emotional resonance and artistry required to truly engage audiences.Critics also point to the challenge of maintaining cultural and creative authenticity in both video games and movies. While AI can produce technically perfect results, the human touch—the skill, imagination, and cultural insight—remains central to crafting meaningful experiences.Musk’s ambitions are equally significant in the film industry. He recently predicted that Grok will produce a movie that is “at least watchable before the end of next year” and will deliver high-quality films by 2027. A six-second video clip of generic Hollywood-style action accompanied the tweet, illustrating the AI’s growing cinematic capabilities.However, generative AI in movies has sparked controversy. The emergence of AI-generated actors, such as Tilly Norwood, has elicited backlash from Hollywood. Furthermore, concerns about copyright infringement persist, as AI platforms—including Grok—have faced legal challenges for generating content using copyrighted characters. For instance, Grok-generated images of Nintendo’s mascot were removed from Twitter due to takedown notices. Disney and Universal have also taken legal action against AI companies for unauthorized use of their characters. Grok Imagine 0.9 represents a pivotal moment in AI content generation, bridging the worlds of video, film, and gaming. Musk’s predictions indicate a future where AI can create movies, games, and interactive experiences with unprecedented speed, while also raising questions about ethics, creativity, and copyright.Industry experts argue that while AI is a powerful tool, human creativity and oversight remain essential. The future of AI-driven filmmaking and gaming will likely involve a hybrid approach, combining AI’s technical efficiency with the artistry and vision of human creators.","Elon musk’s grok imagine 0.9 boosts ai video, text, and image creation.

Google expands AI infrastructure and data centres

Strengthening Belgium’s digital future

AI’s potential for economic growth





US tech giant Google has announced plans to invest €5 billion ($5.8 billion) in Belgium to expand its AI infrastructure and data centre network, creating hundreds of new jobs and supporting local economic growth. The investment will focus on the company’s existing Saint-Ghislain site and the new Farciennes campus, with construction already underway. Google said the expansion will strengthen Belgium’s role in Europe’s cloud and AI sector, provide large-scale computing capacity powered by carbon-free energy, and create opportunities for local suppliers and contractors. Officials highlighted the move as a vote of confidence in Belgium’s tech ecosystem and workforce.The investment will modernise and expand Google’s network of data centres in Saint-Ghislain and Farciennes, enabling the company to handle large volumes of digital data and support advanced AI systems. These facilities are designed to operate entirely on clean energy, aligning with Google’s global goal to achieve carbon-free operations by 2030. The expansion will also support the development of new onshore wind farms in Belgium to power the centres sustainably.The project is expected to create around 300 new full-time jobs directly, while indirectly supporting approximately 15,000 additional roles through local contractors and partners. Google already works with about 150 Belgian suppliers, including 80 in Wallonia, and the expansion will further boost construction, technology, and service sector employment. Prime Minister Bart De Wever emphasized that the investment underscores Belgium’s growing importance as a digital and green technology hub.Belgium has become a key location for technology growth thanks to its reliable internet networks, stable power supply, and skilled workforce. Google Cloud already serves Belgian companies and organizations such as Odoo and UZ Leuven, helping them scale AI-based tools for healthcare, research, and business. The new investment will enhance Belgium’s competitiveness in the European cloud and AI market, attracting further international investment and innovation.A 2024 study commissioned by Google estimated that artificial intelligence could increase Belgium’s GDP by €45 to €50 billion over the next decade. Most jobs are expected to be supported or improved by AI, with only a small portion at risk of automation. By expanding AI infrastructure, Google aims to equip Belgian companies and the workforce with advanced digital tools while fostering sustainable and inclusive growth.","Google plans to invest €5 billion ($5.8 billion) in belgium to expand its ai infrastructure and data centre network.

"Arm CEO Rene Haas is 'sorry' for Intel; says: Unfortunately, Intel has ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/arm-ceo-rene-haas-sees-sorry-for-intel-says-unfortunately-intel-has-/articleshow/124399073.cms,"Arm CEO Rene Haas. Image credit: YouTube

“Intel has unfortunately been punished on a few areas.”

What Arm CEO Rene Haas said about Intel’s missed opportunities



“There are long product cycles. It takes a long time to develop chips.

It takes a long time to invest in fabs. It takes a long time to define architectures and ecosystems. If you miss a few time is very…you will be punished for that. I think Intel has unfortunately been punished on a few areas. They were punished on mobile, obviously, they missed that completely. They were also punished in terms of manufacturing of going to EUV, an advanced methodology for building the smallest chips on the planet.

They decided not to invest in that probably a decade ago at the rate that TSMC did, and they fell behind.”

“Once you fall behind in chips, it's very difficult to catch up because the cycle gets on top of you. TSMC now has the best fabs in the world. The leading-edge companies, Apple, NVIDIA, AMD, they all build at TSMC. TSMC gets better at what they're building. An Intel, a Samsung, they don't get the opportunities. It just compounds. And that flywheel once it compounds and it compounds, it's very hard to catch up in a series of position,”

Poll Do you see a significant cultural divide affecting the semiconductor industry in the US versus Taiwan? Yes, it's a major factor No, it's overstated

Rene Haas on cultural divide in semiconductor industry



“I mean, we may have had it a generation or so ago. I don't know that we have it now. And we certainly haven't trained a generation of folks to look at manufacturing jobs as being something that is as lucrative and prestigious. They're sort of thinking, ‘Oh, it's a blue collar job. I don't want to go into that way.’ It's not viewed that way in Taiwan, right? And in Taiwan, if you say you're working for TSMC or studying to go off and do that, it's a highly prestigious kind of thing,”





Arm CEO Rene Haas suggested that Intel could face challenges in matching TSMC’s position as a major chip foundry. The chief executive of the UK-based semiconductor and software design company stated that once a company falls behind in the semiconductor industry, recovery is an uphill climb. In a recent All-in Podcast, Haas, while commenting on the debate about whether Intel could serve as a viable US-based alternative to the Taiwanese chip manufacturer, said thatHe also pointed out the opportunities that the US-based chip maker missed, explaining why all the leading companies like Apple and Nvidia are flocking to build from TSMC.At the podcast, Haas said:Haas explained.In addition, Haas noted cultural differences in how manufacturing is viewed, stating that while such jobs are respected in Taiwan, they are often perceived as less appealing in the West, which could impact the long-term stability of US manufacturing.he noted.","Arm ceo rene haas suggested that intel could face challenges in matching tsmc’s position as a major chip foundry.

Tata Motors’ shares fell 6.8% over the past four sessions to touch Rs 689.3 on the BSE on Wednesday, slipping below the Rs 700 mark as investors awaited the record date for the company’s upcoming demerger.The decline comes amid market anticipation of the separation of its commercial and passenger vehicle businesses, alongside the phased restart of production at its UK-based luxury arm, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), following a cyber incident, according to an ET report.JLR resumed its manufacturing operations from October 8 after a disruption in early September. The company also announced a new financing solution to support supplier cash flows as vehicle production gradually returns to normal.Tata Motors is undertaking a 1:1 demerger that will create two independent listed entities: TML Commercial Vehicles and Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles, which will include JLR. The company has fixed October 14, 2025, as the record date for determining eligible shareholders for the 1:1 share allotment.
