GUWAHATI: India's food safety watchdog has ordered companies to stop calling herbal infusions - from rooibos to flowers - ""tea"" unless the drink comes solely from the Camellia sinensis tree. FSSAI has directed all businesses to stop branding herbal and plant-based infusions ""tea"", warning that such labels mislead consumers and amount to misbranding under Food Safety and Standards Act , 2006.""It has come to the notice of FSSAI that some food business operators are marketing products that are not obtained from the plant Camellia sinensis under the name 'Tea,' such as 'Rooibos Tea,' 'Herbal Tea,' 'Flower Tea,' etc,"" the regulator said. Under Food Safety and Standards (Food Product Standards and Food Additives) Regulations, 2011, tea refers exclusively to products made from Camellia sinensis, source of black, green, Kangra and instant teas in solid form.Plant-based or herbal infusions or blends do not qualify to be named tea, either directly or indirectly, the regulator said.Brands selling calming, detoxifying or botanical blends will now have to rebrand. Online platforms face large-scale relisting.""We are very happy with this much-needed clarification from FSSAI,"" said Bidyananda Barkakoty, adviser to North Eastern Tea Association. ""This definition of tea will remove a lot of ambiguity from consumer's mind, and will also help remove clutter and confusion,"" he said.Barkakoty said even US Food and Drug Administration recognised only tea derived from Camellia sinensis as a ""healthy"" beverage, not herbal infusions.","India's food safety watchdog has ordered companies to stop calling herbal infusions ""tea"" unless the drink comes solely from the camellia sinensis tree.

ISRO Launches Heaviest-Ever Satellite BlueBird Block-2 Onboard LVM3 Rocket

SRIHARIKOTA: India’s heavy-lift rocket LVM3 on Wednesday successfully placed the US communications satellite- BlueBird Block-2 - into low Earth orbit, in an early morning launch mission. At 6100kg, it was the heaviest payload lifted by the rocket which completed its sixth operational flight and third dedicated commercial mission. Isro chairman V Narayanan said LVM3 rocket achieved an orbit of 518.5km against the planned 520km orbit.""This is the heaviest satellite to be launched by an Indian launcher in Indian soil. This is also the first back to back LVM3 launch missions within a period of 52days. With this, Isro has placed 434 satellites for 34 countries.""The 43.5m tall and 640tonne rocket lifted off from the Second Launch Pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota. About 16 minutes after liftoff, BlueBird Block-2 was injected into a circular orbit at an altitude of around 520km with an inclination of 53degrees.The mission, designated LVM3-M6, was undertaken as part of a commercial agreement between NewSpace India Limited (NSIL), the commercial arm of Isro, and US-based AST & Science LLC.BlueBird Block-2 is part of a global low Earth orbit constellation aimed at enabling direct-to-mobile satellite connectivity.According to mission details, the satellite features a 223 square metre phased-array antenna, making it the largest commercial communications satellite deployed in low Earth orbit. The constellation is designed to support 4G and 5G voice and video calls, video streaming, text messaging and data services directly on standard mobile phones, without the need for specialised ground equipment.","At 6100kg, it was the heaviest payload lifted by the rocket.

Kunal Kushwaha, an Indian-origin tech educator and developer advocate, shared a personal account of the limits he says come with holding an Indian passport while working globally. In a viral post on X, Kushwaha described how visa rules and paperwork often disrupt his travel plansAfter a recent trip to Berlin, Kushwaha said he was unable to travel to Ireland to surprise his best friend on his birthday because there was not enough time to apply for another visa. What should have been a simple decision, booking a flight, instead turned into hours spent navigating visa websites. The episode, he wrote, showed how routine travel can become unnecessarily complicated.In his post, Kushwaha described standing in long airport queues while other travellers passed through quickly. He said he often carries folders of documents he has already submitted many times. Schengen visa applications, he added, feel like a full-time job. They require bank statements, cover letters and detailed explanations for ordinary trips.“I’m not angry. I’m tired,” he wrote. Kushwaha stressed that his frustration is practical rather than emotional.He said national pride does not reduce the mental effort needed to deal with constant paperwork.The post also pointed to wider questions about passport strength. India ranks low on global mobility indexes and offers visa-free access to relatively few destinations. Kushwaha argued that these rankings translate into real constraints for professionals who travel frequently for work, conferences and collaboration.Many replies to his post shared similar experiences. Users posted stories of delayed appointments, short visa validity periods and uncertainty even for repeat travellers with established international careers.Kushwaha also touched on issues beyond travel. He said investments made in India had lost value over time because of the rupee’s decline. He also mentioned air pollution and outdated banking and KYC processes as factors that add to everyday friction.","Kunal kushwaha, an indian-origin tech educator and developer advocate, shared a personal account of the limits he says come with holding an indian passport.

Bluebird Lift-Off Shows ISRO Commercial Power As Nambi Narayanan Calls LVM-3 Game Changer Move

The Indian Space Research Organisation ( Isro ) on Wednesday released rare onboard camera footage from its heaviest rocket, LVM3-M6, offering a rocket-eye view of the BlueBird Block-2 mission from liftoff to satellite separation.The footage shared by Isro on X features visuals captured by cameras onboard and documents each major phase of the ascent. The footage shows the rocket lifting off from the second launch pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, followed by the separation of the twin S200 solid strap-on boosters. It then captures the separation of the L110 liquid core stage and the jettisoning of the payload fairing, before concluding with the successful separation of the BlueBird Block-2 satellite into Low Earth Orbit.The stunning visuals were recorded during Isro’s successful commercial launch of the next-generation US communication satellite for AST SpaceMobile earlier in the day. The 6,100 kg satellite was placed into its intended orbit at an altitude of about 520 km, approximately 15 minutes after launch.The 43.5-metre-tall LVM3 lifted off at 8.55 am after the completion of a 24-hour countdown. Powered by two S200 solid boosters, a liquid core stage and a cryogenic upper stage, the rocket performed all mission events as planned.The space agency said the mission, designated LVM3-M6, marked the sixth operational flight of the LVM3 launch vehicle, nicknamed ‘Bahubali’ for its heavy-lift capability. Isro chief, Dr V Narayanan, described mission’s success as a ""season’s gift"" to the country.BlueBird Block-2 is part of a Low Earth Orbit constellation being developed by US-based AST SpaceMobile. The satellite is designed to enable direct-to-mobile connectivity, providing 4G and 5G voice and video calls, text messaging, streaming and data services directly to standard mobile smartphones.Developed by Isro, the three-stage LVM3 has a lift-off mass of 640 tonnes and a payload capability of 4,200 kg to Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit.

Live streaming clips spark backlash as Clavicular claims he acted in self-defense







Controversial online streamer Braden “Clavicular” has reportedly been banned from Kick after a disturbing incident during a live broadcast. The clips on X appeared to show the young content creator allegedly running over a person while driving a Tesla Cybertruck. The incident quickly spread across X and Reddit, sparking outrage and concern.Soon after the videos went viral, Clavicular’s Kick channel became inaccessible. Viewers attempting to open his page were met with an error message. While Kick has not released an official statement, the timing suggests the ban followed the livestream footage. The situation remains unclear, with different claims emerging online about what actually happened and the condition of the person involved.One of the most widely shared clips was a 23-second video posted on X. In the footage, a person could be seen lying across the windshield of Clavicular’s Tesla Cybertruck. Someone off-camera was heard telling him to start driving. Moments later, the vehicle appeared to move forward, allegedly running over the individual.Another clip from the same livestream later surfaced. At that moment, Clavicular spoke to someone wearing a reflective safety jacket on the road.He stated that he acted out of fear and thought he was in danger. He claimed people were surrounding his car and said he thought they were armed. He explained that he could not see clearly and believed weapons were visible through their clothing.As speculation grew, an associate of Kick star Adin Ross shared an update during a live broadcast. The associate stated that the person involved in the incident was not dead. Adin Ross responded to the update by questioning why viewers were reacting negatively in the chat.Ross later revealed that he had spoken directly with Clavicular after the streamer’s Kick channel went offline. During the call, Ross appeared to reassure him. He suggested that Clavicular should begin recording immediately and go live on Instagram. Ross advised him to document everything, avoid answering questions, and remain silent while the situation unfolded.At the time of writing, Clavicular’s Kick channel still cannot be accessed. The error message reads that the page cannot be found. There has been no official confirmation from Kick or law enforcement about the full details of the incident.The case continues to develop as online users await clarity on the ban, the livestream incident, and the condition of the person allegedly struck by the vehicle.Also Read: Bryce Hall threatens Kick streamer Braden “Clavicular” over alleged disrespect toward his girlfriend","Braden ""clavicular"" has reportedly been banned from kick after a disturbing incident during a live broadcast.

Goldman Sachs initiated its coverage of PhysicsWallah with a neutral rating and a target price of Rs 135. Analysts said the company is one of India’s largest edtech platforms, with a broadly equal mix of revenues from online and offline segments. They forecast a 24% compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of revenue for FY25-FY30 (vs 38% for last two years), at mid-to-high end of India internet coverage, with 80%+ earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) CAGR over this period. Analysts said they view such numbers as a function of PW’s strong top of the funnel organic traffic, a relatively benign competitive environment in India’s edtech sector, and PW’s pricing structure that allows it to penetrate deeper into multiple new education categories. They also warned that PW’s business model also has a negative working capital cycle, and forecast 100%+ free cash flow to net income for the company starting FY26.Avendus Spark initiated its coverage of LG Electronics with a reduce rating and a target price of Rs 1,536. Analysts said despite lower bargaining power and increasing customer choices due to competition, LG’s extensive reach remains a key strength and moat.The company has a robust in-house manufacturing capability and a third facility is in the pipeline to cater to the South Indian market and exports, which will also save logistics costs. They said the company is likely to face market share erosion, revenue impact and challenges in its niche premium/super-premium categories due to relatively new entrants.Nuvama has initiated its coverage of Knowledge Marine Engineering Works with a buy rating and a target price of Rs 2,500. Analysts said that India’s maritime industry is at an inflection point with unprecedented emphasis on infrastructure creation and inland waterways. KMEW enjoys a 50% order-win rate amid scarce competition and high entry barriers, delivers superior 35–40% EBITDA margin and is diversified across a spectrum of dredging, shipbuilding and ancillary services accounting for 43%, 11% and 46% of balance order book, respectively.HSBC has a buy rating on Ambuja Cement with the target price at Rs 700. Analysts said that the company’s board has approved the amalgamation of ACC and Orient Cement into Ambuja, with the completion expected within twelve months. The company’s management expects operational synergies to drive cost savings of at least Rs 100/tonne. Analysts see the amalgamation as a positive move for the companyInvestec has a buy rating on RBL Bank with the target price at Rs 430. Analysts said that the bank intends to deploy $1.5 billion of $3 billion infusion to retire high-cost liabilities and expects rating upgrades (AA- to AA+/AAA) to narrow its wholesale funding cost gaps vs larger peers. The lender expects to grow its loan book at 30% in FY27, led by wholesale, prime housing, and a pick-up in unsecured retail. Under the new expected credit loss (ECL) norms that is effective April 2027, the management expects a one-time impact of Rs 1,500 to Rs 1,700 crore (4% of post-dilution net worth) and a 20–25 basis points (100 basis points = 1 percentage point) rise in credit costs on a run-rate basis, partly offset by faster secured lending growth.","Goldman sachs initiated its coverage of physicswallah with a neutral rating.

How Travis Hunter built major wealth through college NIL deals

Why Travis Hunter is ahead of Jaxson Dart in money right now



Jaxson Dart vs Travis Hunter: What comes next for their careers and money

Jaxson Dart and Travis Hunter are two of the most talked-about young names in American football right now. Both made big money before even reaching the NFL. Their wealth comes mainly from college NIL deals, not pro contracts yet. One is a quarterback. The other plays both offense and defense. Their paths are different, but the money story is just as interesting. Here is a clear look at who has more wealth in 2025.Jaxson Dart plays quarterback for the Ole Miss Rebels. As of 2025, he is not an NFL player yet. He remains a top NFL Draft prospect, but no pro contract has been signed.Jaxson Dart’s estimated net worth in 2025 sits between $1.5 million and $2 million. This money comes from verified NIL deals during his college career.He partnered with brands connected to apparel, sports gear, and regional promotions. Quarterbacks often earn more attention, but Dart has kept a low profile off the field.In late 2024, he returned to Ole Miss instead of entering the NFL Draft. That decision delayed NFL money but kept his college earnings stable and safe.Travis Hunter plays for the Colorado Buffaloes. He is famous for playing both wide receiver and cornerback.As of 2025, he is also not yet in the NFL, but he is widely projected as a top draft pick.Travis Hunter net worth in 2025 is estimated between $5 million and $6 million. He signed deals with some brands like Adidas, United Airlines, and Panini America. These deals helped him be the highest paid athlete.In December 2024, Travis Hunter won the Heisman Trophy, which pushed his market value even higher.The biggest reason for the gap is brand power. Travis Hunter plays two positions and brings national attention every week. That makes him more valuable to sponsors.Jaxson Dart earns well for a college quarterback, but he does not have the same national ad reach yet. NFL money could change that later.Both players are expected to enter the 2025 NFL Draft. Once that happens, the money gap could shift fast. Quarterbacks often earn more long term. For now, Travis Hunter clearly leads in total wealth, while Jaxson Dart’s biggest payday is still ahead.Also Read: Travis Kelce And Taylor Swift Vs Stefon Diggs And Cardi B Combined Net Worth In 2025: Who Is Richer, Nfl Power Couples, Music Fame, Earnings And More","Jaxson dart and travis hunter are two of the most talked-about young names in american football right now.

What can be the impact on Indian professionals?

NEW DELHI: After US President Donald Trump's proposal to impose a $100,000 entry fee on new H-1B visa applications, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has announced a major overhaul of the visa selection process replacing the long-standing random lottery system with a new wage-weighted selection model.In a statement on Tuesday, the department said it is amending rules governing the H-1B visa programme to ""implement a weighted selection process that will increase the probability that H-1B visas are allocated to higher-skilled and higher-paid"" applicants, with the stated aim of protecting the wages, working conditions and job opportunities of American workers.The new guidance comes amid an intensifying crackdown by the Trump administration on immigration, both legal and illegal including the H-1B programme, which US companies rely on to hire foreign talent. Indian professionals form one of the largest groups of H-1B visa holders in the United States.The H-1B programme allows US employers especially technology firms to hire foreign workers in specialised fields. Visas are typically valid for three to six years.Until now, total H-1B fees generally ranged between $2,000 and $5,000. Under Trump’s order, the fee for new H-1B applications would jump to $100,000, dramatically raising hiring costs for employers.Under the current system, H-1B visas are allocated through a random lottery after electronic registrations, as demand far exceeds the annual quota of 85,000 visas (65,000 regular cap plus 20,000 for advanced degree holders).That system will now change.Under the new rule, H-1B visas will no longer be allocated purely by chance. Instead, registrations will be weighted based on wage levels set by the US Department of Labour (DOL). Applicants offered higher salaries will have a better chance of selection.The new rule, released on Tuesday night, will take effect from February 27, 2026, ahead of the FY 2027 H-1B cap registration season. H-1B e-registrations typically open in March.US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) said the existing lottery system was prone to abuse. USCIS said the random lottery allowed some employers to flood the system with lower-wage applications, hurting American workers.""The existing random selection process of H-1B registrations was exploited and abused by US employers who were primarily seeking to import foreign workers at lower wages than they would pay American workers,"" USCIS spokesman Matthew Tragesser said, PTI reported.""The new weighted selection will better serve Congress' intent for the H-1B program and strengthen America's competitiveness by incentivising American employers to petition for higher-paid, higher-skilled foreign workers. With these regulatory changes and others in the future, we will continue to update the H-1B program to help American businesses without allowing the abuse that was harming American workers,"" he added.USCIS said the reform is part of a broader effort to strengthen the integrity of the H-1B programme and aligns with other changes, including Trump’s proclamation imposing an additional $100,000 per visa.""As part of the Trump Administration's commitment to H-1B reform, we will continue to demand more from both employers and aliens so as not to undercut American workers and to put America first,"" Tragesser added.Trump’s renewed crackdown on immigration and H-1B visas is expected to impact Indian IT majors, particularly Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys, according to an analysis.A Bloomberg News study said the impact would be especially sharp for international staffing firms that act as intermediaries for US companies seeking H-1B talent. These include Tata Consultancy Services Ltd., Infosys Ltd. and Cognizant Technology Solutions Corp.This year, Amazon emerged as the largest recipient, with over 10,000 visas approved, followed by TCS, Microsoft, Apple and Google. California continues to host the highest number of H-1B workers.Indian nationals form the largest group of H-1B visa holders. In the fiscal year ending September 2024, 80,449 of the 1.41 lakh H-1B approvals (57%) were for Indian beneficiaries, according to USCIS.However, analysis by the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP) suggests the new system will heavily favour senior professionals. The probability of selection would rise 107% for Level IV wage earners, but fall 48% for Level I workers.This means entry-level professionals and recent international graduates from US universities with many of them Indians, could face steep barriers.From December 15, the US State Department began enhanced screening and vetting of H-1B and dependent H-4 visa applicants, including checks of their social media profiles.The tighter scrutiny has also led to several H-1B visa interviews across India being postponed and pushed back by months, leaving many applicants who travelled to India for visa stamping stranded.While the administration argues the new system will curb abuse and protect American workers, the combined effect of higher fees, wage-based selection and tighter vetting is likely to reshape the H-1B landscape, making it tougher for younger professionals to enter the US workforce and potentially pushing more work offshore.Supporters of the H-1B programme argue it is crucial for hiring healthcare professionals and educators, drives innovation, and supports economic growth in the US by filling specialised roles. Critics, however, claim the visas are often used for entry-level roles rather than highly specialised positions. They argue that companies can suppress wages by classifying jobs at lower skill levels, even when the hired workers have significant experience.","The department of homeland security (dhs) has announced a major overhaul of the visa selection process. The new guidance comes amid an intensifying crackdown by the trump administration on immigration, both legal and illegal.

Lance Armstrong’s life today and recent updates

Lance Armstrong is a former American cyclist who once ruled the sport. He is also a cancer survivor, author, and public speaker. His story includes great success, a major fall, and a long road to rebuilding his life and finances after one of the biggest scandals in sports history.According to Celebrity Net Worth, Lance Armstrong’s net worth is estimated at $50 million. One of the primary reasons Armstrong remains wealthy today is his early investment in Uber. In 2009, he invested $100,000 through Chris Sacca’s venture capitalist fund.That investment later grew to an estimated $20 to $30 million, according to CNBC. Armstrong himself said in a 2018 CNBC interview that the Uber investment “saved” his family financially during hard years.Lance Armstrong was born on September 18, 1971, in Texas. He became a top athlete at a young age and turned professional in the early 1990s. In 1996, his career stopped when doctors found advanced testicular cancer that had spread to his lungs and brain.After months of treatment, Armstrong returned to cycling in 1998. From 1999 to 2005, he won the Tour de France seven times. At that time, he was one of the most famous athletes in the world.In 2012, the United States Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) banned Armstrong for life after finding strong evidence of doping. He was stripped of all titles from 1998 onward. Major sponsors like Nike, Trek, and Oakley ended their deals.During the period of his greatest success, Armstrong’s total assets were more than $100 million. His fortune plummeted due to sponsors withdrawing, court cases, and settlements. Armstrong confessed to using performance-enhancing drugs in a talk with Oprah Winfrey in 2013, thereby verifying the investigations' results.Lance Armstrong has his primary residence in Texas and Colorado at present. His income comes from different sources, such as podcasts, speaking sessions, and business investments. Although he has severed ties with the Livestrong Foundation, the charity has raised more than $500 million in total support for cancer.In recent years, Armstrong has stayed out of major controversy and focuses on media work and family life. His financial position has remained stable, with no major new scandals reported by reliable US outlets.Also Read: “I don’t call everyone brothers”: Khabib Nurmagomedov and Zlatan Ibrahimovic share playful strength moment","Lance armstrong is a former american cyclist who once ruled the sport.

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon musk has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

“probably never have kids,”

“sad”

MrBeast weighs in as Valkyrae discourse takes over social media amid kids and motherhood debate

“who cares, she can do what she wants, it has 0 impact on us.”





Valkyrae recently found herself at the center of online controversy after a short clip from one of her streams went viral on social media. In the clip, the popular streamer said that for the rest of her life she willfocus on playing video games, stay attractive, and continue making money. She framed the comment as a personal preference and a reflection of where she sees her life heading. However, the clip quickly became a talking point across platforms like X, drawing strong reactions from both critics and supporters.As the clip spread, many users began offering opinions on Valkyrae’s choices, with some calling her outlookor predicting she would end up lonely. Others defended her right to choose a career-focused life without marriage or children. The debate soon moved beyond Valkyrae herself and turned into a broader argument about women, motherhood, and what society expects from successful women. This reaction also followed a familiar pattern, as Valkyrae has previously sparked similar debates whenever she has discussed kids or family on stream in past years.Amid the growing discourse, MrBeast reacted to one of the viral posts discussing Valkyrae’s comments.Rather than taking a strong position for or against her lifestyle, he criticized the outrage itself.Responding to the debate, MrBeast wrote that he was tired of seeing posts about it and questioned why it mattered at all. In his words,His response echoed a wider frustration with how personal choices often turn into public arguments online.MrBeast’s response changed the tone of the conversation. Instead of people picking apart Valkyrae’s personal choice, his take made many step back and ask a bigger question, why did her private plans become such a huge public debate in the first place? A lot of users agreed with him, saying that decisions about having children are incredibly personal and not something random strangers online should be weighing in on.What started as a simple comment from Valkyrae about her own life quickly turned into a reminder of how easily the internet can turn private choices into public controversy. MrBeast’s reaction cut through that noise, pointing out that not every viral moment needs a moral judgment and that some decisions truly only matter to the person making them.Also Read: Who was Epic Gamer Grandma?

The flip side is: The ‘super apps,’ which are very popular in China, are not popular in the same way outside of China, and I think they’re turning into a Chinese super app. And that may or may not work outside of China. Are they overly projecting one win on the next, or am I just a naive out-of-touch Westerner who’s underestimating where the future’s gonna be? That’ll be interesting to see how that plays out.”

“We’re going to learn a lot,”

“I’m sure we’ll get a bunch of things wrong, but we’re gonna iterate quickly.”

“It might turn out that maybe we’ll need premium content to work. It might be that we need long-form video. And then if we need long-form video, what does that mean for us? Because that’s literally been a market we’ve explicitly decided not to enter,”

“fundamentally different.”

“Some of these new technologies should evolve in a way that you can kind of touch metal, where you can go in there and just tell it what you want, or make it what you want, whether that is shaping [your] feed to give you what you’re interested in or going deep in search to understand something, or creating something and being able to really mold it into what you want more proactively — I think that’s gonna happen over the next two to four years,”

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him. The IIT rejection redirected his life towards a path only few could have imagined and which eventually led him to become the CEO of Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable companies. Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software. Nadella further added that like many of friends he also viewed IIT as the pinnacle of academic achievement. But when he failed to secure admission, Nadella faced a setback that could have easily defined his future. Instead, it became the catalyst for a different journey.Nadella described IIT as “the holy grail” for middle-class students, acknowledging the weight of expectations. Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there. However, all these experiences helped him in building adaptability which later went ahead and defined his leadership style.Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992, after working at Sun Microsystems. Over, the next two decade he rose steadily through the ranks and the became the Microsoft CEO in 2014. When Nadella became the CEO, the company was facing a lot competition from Apple, Google and Amazon. However, under his leadership, Microsoft reinvented itself and it now a market valuation of $3.54 trillion.Nadella has often said that “only in America would someone like me get the chance to prove himself rather than be typecast based on the school I attended.”","Microsoft ceo satya nadella once shared his experience of how not going to iit which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him.
