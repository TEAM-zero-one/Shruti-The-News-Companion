Hope US will address disruptions: Government,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hope-us-will-address-disruptions-government/articleshow/124020921.cms,"NEW DELHI: India responded cautiously to the US move, saying it was likely to have humanitarian consequences by way of the disruption caused for families. It also expressed hope that these disruptions can be addressed suitably by US authorities.The Indian response seemed intended to avoid any confrontation, and said industry in both India and the US has a stake in innovation and creativity and can be expected to consult on the best path forward. ""The full implications... are being studied by all concerned, including Indian industry, which has already put out an initial analysis clarifying some perceptions related to H-1B program,"" said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.""The Government has seen reports related to the proposed restrictions on the US H-1B visa program. The full implications of the measure are being studied by all concerned, including by Indian industry, which has already put out an initial analysis clarifying some perceptions related to the H-1B program,"" said MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal.Reacting to the US move on H-1B visas, the minis- try of external affairs Friday said that skilled talent mobility and exchanges have contributed enormously to technology development, in- novation, economic growth, competitiveness and wealth creation in the US and India.“Policy makers will there- fore assess recent steps taking into account mutual benefits, which include strong people- to-people ties between the two countries,” said the official.According to government sources, mobility of skilled profession- als benefited both countries as it contributed immensely to the economic and technology partnership between them. India remains closely engaged with the US on all is- sues relating to movement of Indian professionals, in- cluding those under the H-1B visa programme through the appropriate India-US bilat- eral dialogue mechanism. Indian nationals received 72.3% of all H-1B visas issued by the US for fiscal year 2023. Seeking better access for Indian professionals in the US, the Modi govt in the past, too, raised H-1B & L-1 visa is- sues, including increase in visa processing fees, high re- jection rates and other diffi- culties faced by the Indian services companies, with the US govt at various levels. India had earlier also tak- en up the matter on US visa fee hike in the Dispute Settle- ment Body of the World Trade Organisation (WTO).",The indian response seemed intended to avoid any confrontation.

Donald Trump's H-1B Visa Fee Hike Shocks Tech Giants and Indians, Experts Call The Move 'Regressive'

What is changing?

“America’s loss will be India’s gain”

Trump's H1B Visa Shock: How It Will Hurt America, Not Just India | I Witness

The India angle







US President Donald Trump’s decision to impose a hefty fee of $100,000 on H-1B visas has triggered widespread debate.Indian industry leaders, political voices and community representatives have all weighed in, warning that the move could backfire on the US while benefiting India.On Friday, Trump signed a proclamation introducing a mandatory fee of $100,000 on H-1B visas, effective from Sunday.Currently, H-1B filing fees range from $2,000 to $5,000, depending on the employer's size. The visas, valid for three years and renewable, are widely used by American companies to bring in highly skilled foreign professionals, many from India.Trump defended the decision as a measure to protect American jobs, arguing that outsourcing firms have used the programme to replace US workers with cheaper foreign talent. He described it as both an economic and national security issue.Former Niti Aayog CEO Amitabh Kant was among the first to react strongly. “Donald Trump’s 100,000 H-1B fee will choke US innovation, and turbocharge India’s. By slamming the door on global talent, America pushes the next wave of labs, patents, innovation and startups to Bangalore and Hyderabad, Pune and Gurgaon,” he wrote on X.Kant argued that India now has an opportunity to harness the expertise of doctors, engineers and scientists who may otherwise have chosen to work in the US.Infosys veteran and investor Mohandas Pai said the cost would discourage fresh applicants. “It has got limited application, because... it doesn’t apply to all the H-1B visas which are already there. So there could be only impact for anybody applying in future, new applications will come down. Nobody’s going to pay $100,000, that is very true,” Pai was quoted as saying by news agency PTI.He added that US firms will increasingly shift work offshore, boosting India’s Global Capability Centres.“Now what will happen is everybody will work to increase offshoring... because it doesn’t make sense, first, you don’t get talent, second the costs are too high. That will happen over the next maybe six months to one year,” he said.Entrepreneur and Snapdeal co-founder Kunal Bahl also weighed in, saying the new rules would prompt many skilled professionals to return home.“Because of the new H-1B rules, a tremendous number of talented individuals are going to be headed back to India,” he wrote on X.“It will no doubt be tough in the beginning to move base, but will work out for them given the tremendous opportunities in India. The talent density in India is going up”, he added.In a separate post, he shared his personal account and wrote, “In 2007, sitting at my desk in Microsoft I got an email that my H1B visa was rejected. It was crushing and numbing at that moment, but life-changing eventually when I moved back to India. To those impacted today, be positive. There is something much bigger & better in store for you.”The move has also faced backlash within the US. Congressman Raja Krishnamoorthi called it “reckless” and “unfortunate,” saying America risks cutting itself off from high-skilled workers who have historically powered its economy, according tor PTI.Community leader Ajay Bhutoria, based in Silicon Valley, warned that such a fee would deter top global talent, adding that it could weaken the region’s technology ecosystem.While Indian professionals looking to work in the US face an additional barrier, experts believe the long-term impact could be positive for India. With higher visa costs deterring mobility, companies may expand operations in India itself, fuelling growth in Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Pune and Gurgaon, as Kant pointed out.As Pai noted, salaries for H-1B workers are already high, often above $100,000, so the perception that the programme imports cheap labour is misplaced. Instead, the new rules may end up shifting innovation and startup growth to India.Data from the US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) shows how significant Indian and global firms are in the H-1B ecosystem. For FY2025, Amazon topped the list with 10,044 approvals, followed by TCS (5,505), Microsoft (5,189), Meta (5,123), Apple (4,202) and Google (4,181).Other major beneficiaries included Cognizant, JP Morgan Chase, Walmart, Deloitte, Infosys, LTIMindtree and HCL America. Experts warn that the $100,000 fee could affect both Indian IT services and US tech giants that rely heavily on this talent pool.Trump’s proclamation may score political points domestically, but experts hav cautioned that it could erode America’s competitive edge. As Amitabh Kant summed up, “America’s loss will be India’s gain.”For India’s tech sector, this may well be the push that accelerates its transformation into a global innovation hub.","Us president donald trump's decision to impose a hefty fee of $100,000 on h-1b visas has triggered widespread debate.

'No need to rush back': Big clarification on new H-1B rules- What US official said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/no-need-to-rush-back-big-clarification-on-new-h-1b-rules-what-us-official-said/articleshow/124017894.cms,"



NEW DELHI: The newly announced $100,000 annual fee on H-1B visas applies only to new applicants and not to existing visa holders, a senior US Administration official told ANI.""Those who are visiting or leaving the country, or visiting India, they don't need to rush back before Sunday or pay the $100,000 fee. $100,000 is only for new and not current existing holders,"" US administrator told ANI.This came as US President Donald Trump on Friday (US time) issued a new presidential proclamation titled ""Restriction on Entry of Certain Nonimmigrant Workers"" that introduces a major overhaul to the H-1B visa programme, imposing a steep USD 100,000 annual fee on H-1B visa applications, raising fresh questions about whether this is a much-needed correction or a potentially crippling blow to America's tech talent pipeline.The new fee takes effect from 12:01 am on September 21, 2025, prompting immigration attorneys and companies to advise H-1B holders or their families currently outside the US to return immediately or risk being stranded.The fee increase represents a massive jump from the current $2,000–5,000 range, sparking concerns over its impact on startups, small businesses, and Indian IT professionals.Earlier, the government expressed serious concern over raise in the H-1B visa fee, calling it a potential disruption for skilled Indian professionals and their families in the United States.Also read: Trump torpedos H-1B visa program, throwing million Indians into turmoil In an official statement, the spokesperson said the full implications are being studied, noting that Indian industry has already put out an initial analysis clarifying some perceptions related to the H-1B program.“Industry in both India and the US has a stake in innovation and creativity and can be expected to consult on the best path forward,” the statement said.It highlighted that talent mobility has contributed enormously to technology development, innovation, economic growth, competitiveness, and wealth creation in both countries.“Policymakers will therefore assess recent steps taking into account mutual benefits, which include strong people-to-people ties between the two countries,” the spokesperson added.","$100,000 annual fee on h-1b visas applies only to new applicants and not to existing visa holders.

ESPN planned a transition before Molly Qerim’s contract expired

Salary expectations and ESPN’s financial focus played a key role

Molly Qerim’s sudden exit from ESPN’s First Take left many fans surprised, given her strong presence and years of consistency as co-host alongside Stephen A. Smith. But new details have shed light on the decision, showing that it was less about controversy and more about timing, business priorities, and financial realities at the network.Burke Magnus, ESPN’s head of content, recently addressed the matter, clarifying that Qerim’s contract was already set to expire by the end of the year. According to him, the company had long been considering a shift. “She was going to come off First Take either way and that was something [where] we had already crossed that bridge,” Magnus explained.He emphasized that the network wanted to expand Qerim’s versatility by getting her involved in other projects, rather than tying her exclusively to one show. Importantly, he praised her character and work ethic, stating, “She’s an awesome person,” while noting, “You know, it’s business.”Behind the scenes, salary dynamics also influenced the decision. With Stephen A. Smith recently signing a $105 million deal averaging $21 million per year, ESPN executives were reluctant to commit major dollars to Qerim’s role. While respected, her co-hosting duties were seen as replaceable by someone who could perform the same function at a lower cost.Reports indicate ESPN is now preparing for a 30- to 45-day casting process to find Molly Qerim’s successor, though no replacement names have been officially revealed.Also Read: ""Early next year"": Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift’s wedding could arrive sooner than fans expecte For loyal viewers, Molly Qerim’s departure marks the end of an era.

Tom Brady’s historic leap into broadcasting

Gisele Bündchen’s enduring dominance in fashion and business

Tom Brady may have shattered records on the field and now in the broadcast booth with his massive Fox Sports deal, but when it comes to overall fortune, he still trails his ex-wife, Gisele Bündchen. The NFL legend’s $375 million contract is historic, yet the Brazilian supermodel’s global fashion empire continues to outpace his financial success.After retiring from his legendary 23-year NFL career, Brady signed a landmark 10-year, $375 million contract with Fox Sports to serve as the network’s lead NFL analyst. The deal, worth $37.5 million annually, makes him the highest-paid sports broadcaster in history, surpassing Tony Romo and Troy Aikman.On the field, Brady earned more than $333 million in NFL contracts and another $140 million from endorsements with brands like Under Armour, Aston Martin, Subway, and UGG. Altogether, his career earnings crossed $473 million before his first Fox broadcast.Despite Brady’s staggering success, Bündchen’s empire still keeps her ahead financially. The Brazilian supermodel, once the highest-paid model in the world for 14 straight years, reportedly continues to bring in around $40 million annually.Her career includes over $500 million in modeling contracts, high-profile endorsements, and ventures in wellness and sustainability. From magazine covers to walking in some of fashion’s most iconic shows, Bündchen’s brand has become bigger than the runway.Also Read: NFL issues warning: No protection for players joining Tom Brady’s Saudi flag football game While Brady’s broadcasting career could help close the gap, Bündchen’s diversified business model ensures her continued dominance.

Why DeepSeek and its model made waves in US tech industry



iPhone Air and iPhone 17 Series Mega Unboxing





Chinese AI developer DeepSeek has revealed the cost of training its R1 model, a figure that is significantly lower than those reported by its US rivals. After launch, the DeepSeek R1 model stood out for its cost-efficient development and its open-source nature, offering unlimited free usage to a wide audience. Its emergence as a direct competitor to models from industry leaders such as OpenAI Google , and Anthropic has brought new scrutiny to the financial investments required for AI development.According to a report by Reuters, DeepSeek revealed that the company spent a significantly low amount—just $294,000—to train its R1 model. This figure was published in a peer-reviewed article in the academic journal Nature.The company’s disclosure may reignite a debate in the tech industry over why US giants are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to train large language models (LLMs).DeepSeek's release of what it claimed were lower-cost AI systems in January caused investors to sell off tech stocks, as they worried the new models could threaten the dominance of companies like Nvidia. The update, which is the first cost estimate the Hangzhou-based company has released for its R1 model, appeared in a paper co-authored by its founder, Liang Wenfeng.The paper specified that the reasoning-focused model was trained using 512 Nvidia H800 chips.By comparison, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in 2023 that ""foundational model training"" had cost ""much more"" than $100 million, though his company has not provided detailed figures, Reuters reported.Some of DeepSeek's previous claims about its development costs and technology have been questioned by US companies and officials. The company’s use of H800 chips comes after the US in October 2022 made it illegal for Nvidia to export its more powerful H100 and A100 AI chips to China.In a supplementary document to the Nature article, DeepSeek acknowledged for the first time that it does own A100 chips and used them in the “preparatory stages of development” for R1.US officials claimed in June that DeepSeek had access to “large volumes” of H100 chips procured after export controls were in place, a claim Nvidia has denied, stating that DeepSeek used lawfully acquired H800 chips.","Chinese ai developer deepseek has revealed the cost of training its r1 model, a figure that is significantly lower than those reported by its us rivals.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang is known for his strict working regimen. Now an old interview has resurfaced online featuring Nvidia CEO. The interview clip has reignited admiration for Huang across the tech industry and Tesla CEO Elon Musk has also chimed in calling Huang’s relentless work ethic as simply ‘Hardcore’. As reported by Bezinga, the video interview was originally released in November 2023 by Norges Bank Investment Management. The interview offers a rare glimpse into Huang’s daily routine and mindset. “I work every day. There’s not a day that goes by that I don’t work. And if I’m not working, I’m thinking about work,” Huang told host Nicolai Tangen, describing a schedule that begins at 5 a.m. and ends at 9:30 p.m.Huang’s work ethics and philosophy on intensity is quite clear: “There’s hard work, and then there’s insanely hard work… I’m on the insanely hard work end of the scale.” Huang also believe that work is a way of relaxation. “Solving problems is relaxing for me. Achieving something is relaxing for me,” said Huang.The interview clip gained a lot of traction of social media and Tesla CEO Elon Muysj also responded to Huang’s work ethics as ‘Hardcore’. Elon Musk is also known for his extreme working habits which includes sleeping at the Tesla factories.Both Huang and Musk are working at the helm of transformative AI efforts.For those unaware, Huang founded Nvidia in 1993, now the company is valued at $4.39 trillion, making it the most valuable company in the world.

Intel's $20 billion mistake now becomes survival strategy

XElectron Techno Review: Turn Any Wall Into a 200-Inch Screen





Twenty years after Intel rejected buying Nvidia for $20 billion, the roles have completely flipped: Nvidia is investing $5 billion in its struggling former takeover target and rescue Intel through a strategic chip partnership. The deal announced Thursday sees Nvidia purchasing Intel stock at $23.28 per share—a 6.5% discount—while the companies collaborate on PC and data center processors. Intel will embed Nvidia's cutting-edge graphics into consumer chips and manufacture specialized processors for Nvidia's AI systems.The partnership crystallises one of tech's most dramatic power shifts. Intel, once Silicon Valley's undisputed chip king with double Nvidia's revenue as recently as 2022, now has a market value under $100 billion. Nvidia has exploded to over $4 trillion, making it the world's second-most valuable company.Back in 2005, then-Intel CEO Paul Otellini pitched acquiring Nvidia to his board, recognizing that graphics chips might revolutionise data centers. Directors balked at the unprecedented price tag and Intel's poor acquisition track record, instead backing an internal project called Larrabee that burned hundreds of millions before collapsing in 2009.Nvidia seized the moment Intel missed. While Intel clung to traditional processors, Nvidia anticipated the AI revolution, developing specialised chips perfect for machine learning before ChatGPT made headlines. When tech giants raced to build AI infrastructure, they turned to Nvidia's ready-made solutions.Today, Nvidia approaches $200 billion in annual revenue—soon earning more each quarter than Intel generates yearly. Its data center business alone dwarfs entire chip companies.Intel has desperately chased the AI wave through acquisitions like Nervana Systems ($400 million) and Habana Labs ($2 billion), but gained little ground against Nvidia's dominance. New CEO Lip-Bu Tan, who replaced the ousted Pat Gelsinger this year, admits Intel won't compete with Nvidia's high-end systems ""anytime soon.""The Nvidia partnership represents pragmatic surrender disguised as collaboration. Intel acknowledges it needs the company it once could have owned to remain relevant in computing's AI-driven future.""This historic collaboration tightly couples Nvidia's AI stack with Intel's x86 ecosystem,"" said Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang, diplomatic language for Intel's dependence on its former potential acquisition target.The investment follows recent lifelines, including government backing and SoftBank's $2 billion injection as Intel struggles to fund its manufacturing ambitions.Intel shares jumped 22% after Nvidia announced $5 billion investment in the chipmaker.",Intel rejected buying nvidia for $20 billion in 2005.

Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, is preparing to introduce its latest wearable technology at the annual Connect event, which is widely seen as a showcase for its augmented reality (AR) and artificial intelligence (AI) ambitions, innovation roadmap, and future consumer experiences. This new product represents the company’s first consumer-ready smart glasses with an integrated digital display, signaling a significant step in Meta’s long-term strategy to bring advanced AI into everyday life and enhance human-computer interaction.The glasses, expected to retail at around $800, will carry the internal code name “Hypernova” and are likely to launch under the brand name “Celeste.” While the glasses’ display is relatively small, it is designed to handle basic digital interactions such as notifications, alerts, messages, and reminders, offering users a glimpse into the potential of AR without being fully immersive.Meta is positioning this launch not just as a gadget, but as a foundational element in its broader vision of wearable technology that interacts seamlessly with AI, potentially transforming the way people access information, collaborate remotely, and connect with the digital world.Over the past several years, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has committed enormous resources—more than $60 billion since 2020—into Meta’s augmented reality and AI divisions.The company envisions smart glasses as a key interface for what is sometimes referred to as “superintelligence,” a theoretical AI that surpasses human capabilities across nearly every cognitive domain.Meta already offers two existing lines of smart glasses in partnership with Ray-Ban and Oakley, which include AI-driven features like cameras, hands-free controls, and livestreaming capabilities to Meta’s social platforms. These products have achieved moderate consumer success, selling around two million units since 2023, making Meta one of the few tech giants to gain traction in the smart glasses market—a market where competitors like Google have struggled.The new Celeste glasses, however, are distinct from these earlier offerings. They represent a step toward more advanced AR capabilities, though they remain less sophisticated than the “Orion” prototype showcased last year, which was presented by Zuckerberg as a “time machine to the future.” Orion, slated for launch in 2027, is expected to be far more technologically advanced and consumer-ready for immersive AR experiences.Celeste will feature a small, integrated display in the right lens, offering essential functions such as notifications and alerts. Analysts have suggested that this modest approach allows Meta to introduce AR to the consumer market gradually, focusing on usability and developer engagement rather than attempting a full-fledged, high-cost immersive device right away.In addition to the glasses, Meta is expected to introduce a new wristband accessory that will allow users to control the device with hand gestures. This accessory enhances interactivity, letting users navigate the glasses without needing to touch them physically, and represents a step toward hands-free, seamless integration of AR into daily life.The company may also incorporate branding collaborations, with rumors suggesting that the Italian fashion house Prada could provide design input. Prada’s signature thick frames and arms could help house the necessary components for the display, battery, and sensors while giving the glasses a premium aesthetic.One of the primary concerns for Celeste is its price. As reported by Reuters, at approximately $800, the glasses are substantially more expensive than Meta’s existing Ray-Ban and Oakley lines, which start at $299 and $399, respectively. Analysts warn that this pricing could limit adoption to tech enthusiasts, early adopters, and niche markets, rather than appealing to a broad mainstream consumer base.Jitesh Ubrani, research manager at IDC, pointed out that the device is likely to be somewhat bulky, heavier than expected, and less consumer-friendly, predicting that sales might reach only a few hundred thousand units initially. Nevertheless, he emphasized that the launch could play a strategic role in attracting developers, encouraging innovative apps, and paving the way for more advanced, mass-market AR devices in the future.Meta’s innovation drive has not been without controversy. The company has faced scrutiny over its handling of child safety on its social media and virtual reality platforms. Whistleblowers have claimed that internal policies previously allowed AI chatbots to engage children in inappropriate conversations, and researchers were allegedly discouraged from investigating potential harms related to VR experiences. Meta has since revised these policies to prohibit such interactions and improve child protection measures.The timing of the Celeste launch highlights the tension Meta faces: the company is racing to maintain relevance in the AI and AR sectors while simultaneously responding to ongoing ethical and regulatory concerns. How it manages these risks will influence consumer trust and adoption of its new wearable products.A key component of the Celeste launch is Meta’s emphasis on developer engagement. The company plans to open the device to third-party developers through a new software kit, enabling external creators to build AR applications and utilities for the glasses.This approach reflects a long-term strategy: while initial sales might be modest, building a robust developer ecosystem is essential for creating a sustainable market for AR devices. By fostering innovation in apps and experiences, Meta hopes to expand the appeal of smart glasses and gradually transition toward more advanced, mainstream products like the Orion headset.","Meta platforms, the parent company of facebook and instagram, is preparing to introduce its latest wearable technology at the annual connect event.

What does the Trump administration’s H1-B order say







Soon after the Trump administration issued an executive order imposing a $100,000 fee on all H-1B visa applications, a move that has caused significant concern within the Indian IT industry, former NITI Aayog CEO and G20 Sherpa, Amitabh Kant, has stated that the new fee will ultimately serve to “choke US innovation and turbocharge India's.”In a post on X, Kant argued that by “slamming the door on global talent,” the US is pushing a massive wave of development toward India's major tech hubs.“America’s loss will be India’s gain,” Kant wrote, adding that the move presents an opportunity for India's best doctors, engineers, scientists, and innovators to contribute to the nation's growth and its vision of a “Viksit Bharat.”“By slamming the door on global talent, America pushes the next wave of labs, patents, innovation and startups to Bangalore and Hyderabad, Pune and Gurgaon,” he said, as these cities are home to offices of global tech giants like Google , Microsoft, and Infosys.“India’s finest Doctors, engineers, scientists, innovators have an opportunity to contribute to India’s growth & progress towards #ViksitBharat. America’s loss will be India’s gain,” he emphasised.President Donald Trump signed an executive order to impose a $100,000 fee per H-1B visa petition for workers outside the US. The order, which takes effect on September 21, 2025, accuses companies of using the H-1B visa programme to replace American workers with cheaper foreign labour.“Some employers, using practices now widely adopted by entire sectors, have abused the H-1B statute and its regulations to artificially suppress wages, resulting in a disadvantageous labor market for American citizens, while at the same time making it more difficult to attract and retain the highest skilled subset of temporary workers, with the largest impact seen in critical science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) fields,” the order said.The new policy aims to direct higher prevailing wage levels for H-1B workers and prioritise those who are high-paid and highly skilled, signaling a dramatic shift in US immigration policy.","President donald trump signed an executive order to impose a $100,000 fee per h-1b visa petition for workers outside the us.
