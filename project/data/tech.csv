Generative AI ups demand for skilled workers: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/generative-ai-ups-demand-for-skilled-workers-study/articleshow/128368504.cms,"India’s AI Rise Gets Global Push As UN Chief Praises Leadership, Nvidia CEO Predicts Job Surge

NEW DELHI: The introduction of generative AI has resulted in moderation in hiring at the entry level, increased demand for skilled mid-level workers, and provided “considerable stability” at senior level, an ICRIER study has said.“Researchers note this moderation aligns with broader post-pandemic trends in the IT industry and cannot be attributed to AI adoption alone. Roles commonly perceived as most exposed to AI, such as software developers and database administrators, are also among those experiencing the strongest growth in demand, indicating that generative AI is primarily functioning as a productivity-enhancing complement to technical and analytical work, rather than a substitute,” said the report, which was backed by OpenAI and based on a survey of over 650 firms.Roles such as statisticians and mathematicians, application developers and database designers and administrators were among the most exposed — and had the highest demand — while HR, legal and finance professionals were least. The most impacted roles and skills include data entry and clerical work, followed by manual testing, manual quality assurance, and entry level programming.Among business functions in IT companies, software development and engineering, followed by IT infra and cloud services and project management were seen to be the most affected, the survey showed.The report said AI adoption is reshaping hiring priorities toward hybrid skills profiles combining domain expertise and AI and data-related technical skills, instead of narrow specialisation.While half the companies surveyed said they were investing in internal awareness and workforce reskilling, the report said: “The cause for concern, however, is that IT firms are not hiring enough workers with skills in large language model operations or expanding their R&D divisions, and, most importantly, are not investing adequately in training and upskilling. The shortage of qualified AI trainers, limited AI skills among new labour market entrants, and policy and regulatory uncertainty surrounding AI are challenges that must be urgently addressed. ”","The introduction of generative ai has resulted in moderation in hiring at the entry level, increased demand for skilled mid-level workers.

NEW DELHI: The Cabinet has approved the launch of Urban Challenge Fund with total central assistance of Rs 1 lakh crore over five years, to help states tackle the day-to-day challenges of rapid urbanisation and steer creative redevelopment of cities, positioning them as growth hubs. It also approved establishment of Startup India Fund of Funds 2.0 with a corpus of Rs 10,000 crore to mobilise venture capital for the startup ecosystem in the country.Announcing the decisions, I&B minister Ashwini Vaishnav said UCF will focus on creative redevelopment of cities, developing them as growth hubs and strengthening water and sanitation systems to drive transformative, market-linked urban infrastructure creation. The Centre-sponsored scheme was announced in 2025-26 Budget.Under this framework, central assistance will cover 25% of a project’s cost, provided that at least 50% of the funding is mobilised from the market. Govt said this will catalyse a total investment of Rs 4 lakh crore in the urban sector over the next five years. “The move marks a paradigm shift in India’s urban new development approach from grant-based financing to market-linked, reform-driven and outcome-oriented infrastructure creation,” it said.UCF will leverage market financing, private sector participation and citizen-centric reforms to deliver high-quality urban infrastructure.All cities with a population of 10 lakh or more, all state capitals and major industrial cities with a population of more than one lakh can avail the fund. All municipal areas in hilly and NE states, as well as smaller ones with a population below 1 lakh, will be eligible for support under Credit Repayment Guarantee Scheme, with Rs 5,000 crore having been approved for it.","The cabinet has approved the launch of urban challenge fund with total central assistance of rs 1 lakh crore over five years.

"AI investments may top $200 billion, $90 billion already pledged: Ashwini Vaishnaw",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ai-investments-may-top-200-billion-90-billion-already-pledged-ashwini-vaishnaw/articleshow/128364125.cms,"'Biggest AI Summit': Ashwini Vaishnaw Says India AI Impact Summit Getting 'Phenomenal Response'

NEW DELHI: Ahead of next week’s AI Impact Summit, Union information technology minister Ashwini Vaishnaw on Saturday said that investments in the infrastructure layer of artificial intelligence may top $200 billion with commitments of around $90 billion already received.“We are working on all five layers of the AI stack. Conventionally, our strength has been providing IT services. Now, we have to convert this into providing AI-based services. The IT industry too has worked in recent years on this changing business model. It has invested in creating new tools and reskilling their workforce, so they can provide AI services,” Vaishnaw said, while addressing the ET NOW Global Business Summit.He added that after the UK, South Korea and France, India is set to host the biggest AI Impact summit next week, with more than 20 Heads of State and govts attending the event.“At the summit, we will be launching our bouquet of sovereign models. On so many parameters, the models are better than Open AI, Gemini Pro and Deep Seek, giving us confidence that India can develop models on very frugal resources,” said the minister, who is also in charge of railways and information and broadcasting ministries.Highlighting the development in the third layer of AI stack, Vaishnaw stressed that progress in semiconductor development — the “chip layer” — had been significant, with startups and research teams developing cutting-edge solutions that are expected to bear fruit in the coming years.Vaishnaw also noted electronic goods will be among the top two exported goods soon.“One of the key things Europeans wanted from India was electronic goods in the FTA. They wanted electronic items of all kinds for their industry and consumers, because we are a trusted country. India will become a trusted partner in the semiconductor and electronics value chain,” Vaishnaw said.The minister said AI is set to outpace all previous industrial revolutions and technological shifts, necessitating the need for industry and society to remain prepared for this swift transformation, as India’s coordinated push across talent, models, chips and applications will help position the country at the forefront of the global AI revolution.Sharing the progress on the first bullet train project , Vaishnaw said that the first section between Mumbai and Ahmedabad will open in 2027. He also said that the proposed Bengaluru–Chennai corridor could reduce travel time to just 73 minutes, thus bringing the two cities much closer and boosting economic activity.“Our engineers have really lived up to the challenge. Our industry too has gone through that learning curve and is practically self-sufficient in the entire high speed train technology. That is why Prime Minister Modi has announced seven new bullet train corridors, which will connect large parts of the country and transform the entire transportation industry. We are also going to standardise the entire system so that anyone in the world can come and participate. We will have a large role for the industry as well,” he added.On wider railway reforms, Vaishnaw said the ministry is working on “52 reforms in 52 weeks” in 2026, with two new reforms slated to be announced on the same day. Seven reforms have already been implemented and the rest are in progress.“These changes aim to improve overall travel experience, especially for daily passengers belonging to the low- and middle-income families. They remain our most important customers in the railways. We have been able to reduce accidents by about 90%. We want to further reduce it,” he said.","'biggest ai summit': ashwini vaishnaw says india ai impact summit getting 'phenomenal response' union information technology minister said investments in the infrastructure layer of artificial intelligence may top $200 billion.

Influencer Clavicular and the Arizona State University fashion show that sparked the framemogging trend

The phrase “Clavicular Framemogging” suddenly took over social media this week. People saw it, paused, and read it again. It sounded confusing. Some even thought it was a medical term. But it is not. It is an internet joke that grew very fast after a viral video from Arizona State University. The trend began when an influencer known as Clavicular appeared at a fashion show at Arizona State University, often called ASU. A short clip from the event started spreading online.In the video, Clavicular is seen standing beside a much larger fraternity member. Viewers quickly began using the phrase “Clavicular was brutally framemogged” to describe what they saw. Within hours, the phrase turned into memes, reaction posts, and debates across social media platforms. Many users were confused at first, then they joined in and that is how the trend exploded.To understand the moment, it helps to know who Clavicular is. He is a niche influencer connected to online looks-focused communities. His content talks about posture, bone structure, shoulder width, and facial balance. He often breaks down how physical proportions affect appearance.The word “mogging” comes from online slang. It means someone visually overpowers another person. “Framemogging” focuses only on body frame, not clothes or face. It is about shoulders, build, and overall outline.During the Arizona State University fashion show livestream, Clavicular was standing next to a fraternity member with a broader build. Viewers noticed the clear difference in size and frame. Soon after, clips were reposted with captions saying, “Clavicular got framemogged.”The irony made people react even more. Clavicular’s content often studies body structure. In this clip, viewers felt he was outmatched in the very area he talks about. That contrast is what made the phrase funny to many users.Another reason the trend grew so quickly is the name itself. “Clavicular Framemogging” sounds dramatic and complex. Internet culture often turns strange, very specific words into viral jokes. Once a few big meme pages shared it, the phrase spread widely.There is no official medical or scientific meaning behind it. It is simply internet slang born from a viral moment at Arizona State University. Still, the influencer’s fashion show debut gave the phrase a face, a setting, and a story. That helped it move from confusion to full trend in less than a day. In the end, the trend shows how fast online language changes. A short campus clip turned into a catchphrase that thousands of people repeated within hours.",The phrase “clavicular framemogging” suddenly took over social media this week.

Almost a year after JPMorgan made 5 days work from office compulsory and CEO Jamie Dimon said don't tell JPMorgan what to do at Townhall; some employees fear petition that they call ‘career ...',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/almost-a-year-after-jpmorgan-made-5-days-work-from-office-compulsory-and-ceo-jamie-dimon-said-dont-tell-jpmorgan-what-to-do-at-townhall-some-employees-fear-petition-that-they-call-career-suicide/articleshow/128211254.cms,"When Jamie Dimon's angry outburst at Townhall went viral

In March 2026, it will be a year since America's biggest bank made 5-day work from office compulsory. The largest US bank, which employs more than 300,000 people globally, told all of its employees to return to the office five days a week starting in March, ending a hybrid work-from-home policy that took effect during the pandemic. Just days after CEO Jamie Dimon's order to all employees to come into the office five days a week, a petition surfaced. The petition, which was part of complaints over JP Morgan's call to bring employees back to office 5 days a week, asked CEO Dimon to reverse the change. The petition that continues to be live online is addressed to chairman and CEO Jamie Dimon. In the petition, employees have complained about losing hybrid working arrangements. ""Some employees sought advice from the Communications Workers of America on how they might set up a labor union, a rare thing in the US finance sector.And now a year since the petition was set up, it has about 2,000 signatories out of the Bank's more than 300,000 global employees. According to a report in Financial Times, there are some who believe that signing the petition will be a ‘career suicide’. The report details internal backlash to the 5-day mandate.As per the report, employees at the America's largest lender told the Financial Times they were bewildered by management’s insistence on a full-time return to company offices, though teams are scattered across the globe. “My team is spread out through two continents and three time zones,” said a JPMorgan employee who signed a petition to bring back hybrid work. “JPMorgan is a global company — why can’t that include my home office?” “Hybrid is working and employees love the happy medium,” the staffer told the FT. ""We, the workers of JPMorganChase (JPMC), are concerned about the future of our workplace - its integrity, employee satisfaction, and the increasing toxicity that has metastasized in our company culture in the last couple of months,"" reads the petition.Dimon announced the five-day return to office policy on January 10, 2025, ahead of a March 2025 start date. Soon after announcing the change, Dimon went viral for angry outburst he had about the employee petition during a Town Hall meeting. When asked about the in-person work policy during the staff meeting, he said, ""Don't waste time on it. I don't care how many people sign that fucking petition,"" he said, drawing some laughter. Instead, Dimon demanded more efficiency and stressed employees have a choice whether to work at JPMorgan. The CEO told them not to be mad at him, and said it was a free country.Dimon, who has run the lender for 19 years, said some staff did not pay attention during Zoom meetings, which reduced their efficiency and creativity. In-office requirements will not be left up to managers, Dimon said. ""There is no chance that I will leave it up to managers,"" he said. ""Zero chance. The abuse that took place is extraordinary.""In an interview to CNBC, Dimon said, that he respects employees who don't want to come into the office five days a week, but said the policy will not change because it is best for clients and the company. ""I am not against working from home, I am against where it doesn't work,"" he said, adding that 10% of the bank's jobs are done remotely.Later in the year, in an interview to Bloomberg, Dimon said that he also understands the appeal of logging in from home; remote work can pan out well for some companies and certain roles. Talking about his angry response to a question on work from home, he said, “I gave a very detailed answer about why [work from home] doesn’t work for young people, why it doesn’t work for management, why it doesn’t work for innovation,” Dimon said. “I completely applaud your right to not want to go to the office every day. But you’re not going to tell JPMorgan what to do.”","Jpmorgan ceo jamie dimon ordered all employees to return to the office five days a week starting in march 2025.

What Sarvam AI has demonstrated - world class AI can be done much more affordably and sustainably with much lower energy and compute footprint - is important.

I have come to believe that in software code generation, much more energy and compute efficient approaches to AI can be developed.

That is important because the earth cannot afford today's AI energy footprint.

Sridhar Vembu has said that artificial intelligence (AI) can be developed in a more affordable and sustainable way, with far lower energy and computing needs than what is commonly used today. In a post shared on X (formerly known as Twitter), Vembu pointed to the work done by Sarvam AI as an example of how high-quality AI systems can be built without heavy reliance on large-scale infrastructure. For those unaware, Sarvam AI is an AI model founded by IIT alumni – Pratyush Kumar and Vivek Raghavan. The Bengaluru-based startup recently claimed that the AI model has outperformed some of the biggest names in artificial intelligence, including Google Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.In the post, Vembu said Sarvam AI’s work shows that “world-class AI” does not require excessive compute power or energy consumption. He added that this approach is important as concerns grow over the environmental impact of large AI models, which rely on energy-intensive data centres.The Zoho founder also said he believes software code generation, in particular, offers scope for more efficient AI techniques. According to Vembu, new approaches could significantly reduce the energy and compute footprint needed to build and run such systems.Sridhar Vembu further warned that the current trajectory of AI development may not be sustainable in the long run. Vembu said the planet cannot support the rising energy demands of today’s AI models, highlighting the need for alternatives that balance performance with environmental responsibility.His comments come amid broader global debate over the cost, scalability, and environmental impact of advanced AI systems, as companies continue to invest heavily in computing infrastructure to train and deploy large models.","Sridhar vembu said sarvam ai's work shows that ‘world-class ai’ does not require excessive compute power or energy consumption.

"What’s in a name, if we can’t make it ‘ours’? Indians and their delicious dialect of food",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/whats-in-a-name-if-we-cant-make-it-ours-indians-and-their-delicious-dialect-of-food/articleshow/128369928.cms,"



PUNE: When a croissant became ‘prashant’ it wasn’t just a meme; it was a moment. The trending video of an Indian boy confidently misnaming the French pastry caught fire, and Britannia leaned in, renaming its own croissants ‘prashant’.Across India, mispronunciations of foreign foods are a norm and not an exception. ‘Crêpe’ (krehp) often becomes ‘crape’, ‘crème brûlée’ (krem broo-lay) morphs into ‘cream broo-lee’ and ‘schnitzel’ (shnitsel) is ‘snitch-sale’.In this multilingual, masala-loving country, getting it “wrong” is often just our way of making it ours.Navdeep Tupe, an IT professional in the city, recalled how he was taught the correct pronunciation of Quesadilla by the owner of a Mexican restaurant with a linguistic jugaad. “I knew what it was as Isaw it in TV shows and movies and wanted to try it. The owner at the counter saw me struggling to order it, saying ‘kwesadilla’. She told me to pronounce it as ‘kaise diya’, like when you’re asking a vendor the price of something,” said Tupe.Tanmay Tagare, teaching German at the Goethe-Institut/Max Mueller Bhavan Pune, said pronunciation was half the battle, and often half the fun. “One of the quirks of teaching German in India is watching how confidently, and hilariously, students mispronounce foreign food names.Sachertorte (pronounced zakh-er-tor-teh) is a famous Viennese chocolate sponge cake, but students often link Sacher to sakhar (sugar in Marathi),” he said.“Muskatnuss (pronounced moos-kaat-nooss) means nutmeg, but Muskat sounds like muskatt, which means a slap! Wange (pronounced vahn-geh) means cheek, but students burst out laughing because it sounds like vaange, brinjal. Then there’s Dickmilch (pronounced dikmilkh), a type of sour milk, which gets some very awkward reactions when said in English,” Tagare added.Not just international cuisine, Indian regional dishes get mispronounced too. ‘Nenjelumbu rasam’ turns into ‘ninja rasam’ and ‘Chemmeen Ularthiyadhu’ is as good as anyone’s guess.Adeline Lannes, a French national pursuing an internship in Kolkata, said, “The whole ‘croissant-prashant’ fiasco was hilarious. My friends back in France were making reels, where they were going to cafes and asking for prashant, not croissant. But it shows the love and demand for croissants among Indians, in India and while travelling abroad. We too make mistakes when ordering Indian food. I remember how I kept calling a sandesh a ‘sandwich’ till one of my colleagues corrected me politely. ”Preetam Shah, a hospitality executive from Surat, recalled how local dishes were often mispronounced not only by foreign nationals but also by non-Gujaratis. “When I was doing my hotel management in 2018, a foreign student kept referring to ‘kadhi’ as ‘curry’. I explained that while both were gravies, ‘kadhi’ had aunique preparation with yogurt and gram flour. I also noticed how many non-Gujarati speaking people referred to ‘Akha Adad’ as ‘Aka Dad’.

How the Know Your Rights app help immigrants

Recognition and next steps





Fourteen-year-old Julian Miramontes from Los Angeles has earned national recognition for creating a mobile app designed to help immigrants understand their legal rights. An eighth grader at El Sereno Middle School, Miramontes developed the Know Your Rights app after witnessing fear and uncertainty in his community linked to immigration enforcement. The app explains key constitutional protections and uses short quizzes to make complex legal concepts easier to understand. His project won the Congressional App Challenge in California’s 34th Congressional District.Julian Miramontes is a middle school student from the El Sereno neighbourhood of Los Angeles with an early interest in technology and coding. He developed his skills through school-based STEM programmes and is described by teachers and family members as curious and community-minded. Rather than focusing on competition, his work reflects an effort to use technology to respond to real-life issues affecting people around him.Miramontes has said the idea for the app came from seeing how immigration raids and enforcement actions created fear and confusion in his neighbourhood. Many people did not know what their legal rights were during encounters with federal agents. With guidance from his STEM teacher, he designed the app as a quick, reliable resource that could be used during stressful situations.The Know Your Rights app explains basic constitutional protections in clear language, including the right to remain silent. Information is broken into short sections and reinforced through simple multiple-choice quizzes that help users check their understanding. The design focuses on clarity, speed, and accessibility, making the app usable for people without legal training who need information quickly.The Know Your Rights app won the Congressional App Challenge in California’s 34th Congressional District, a nationwide competition that encourages middle and high school students to create apps addressing community needs. As a district winner, Miramontes received a cash prize and an invitation to travel to Washington, DC, to meet other student winners.His parents said the project reflects both his technical ability and his concern for others. US Representative Jimmy Gomez praised the app for addressing fear in the community and meeting the goals of the competition. The app is not publicly available and can currently be accessed only through a shared link, but it has drawn positive attention online. Miramontes has said his focus remains on helping people feel informed and less afraid.",Julian miramontes created the know your rights app after witnessing fear and uncertainty in his community linked to immigration enforcement.

Canada, Greenland Show Of Power Amid Trump's ‘Invasion’ Storm; 'Difficult Times Are...'





The makers of mobile apps designed to help shoppers identify and boycott American goods say they saw a surge of interest in Denmark and beyond after the recent flare-up in tensions over U.S. President Donald Trump's designs on Greenland.The creator of the ""Made O'Meter"" app, Ian Rosenfeldt, said he saw around 30,000 downloads of the free app in just three days at the height of the trans-Atlantic diplomatic crisis in late January out of more than 100,000 since it was launched in March.Apps offer practical help Rosenfeldt, who lives in Copenhagen and works in digital marketing, decided to create the app a year ago after joining a Facebook group of like-minded Danes hoping to boycott U.S. goods.""Many people were frustrated and thinking, 'How do we actually do this in practical terms,'"" the 53-year-old recalled. ""If you use a bar code scanner, it's difficult to see if a product is actually American or not, if it's Danish or not. And if you don't know that, you can't really make a conscious choice.""The latest version of ""Made O'Meter"" uses artificial intelligence to identify and analyze several products at a time, then recommend similar European-made alternatives.Users can set preferences, like ""No USA-owned brands"" or ""Only EU-based brands."" The app claims over 95% accuracy.""By using artificial intelligence, you can take an image of a product ... and it can make a deep dive to go out and find the correct information about the product in many levels,"" Rosenfeldt told The Associated Press during a demonstration at a Copenhagen grocery store. ""This way, you have information that you can use to take decisions on what you think is right.""'Losing an ally' After an initial surge of downloads when the app was launched, usage tailed off. Until last month, when Trump stepped up his rhetoric about the need for the U.S. to acquire Greenland, a strategically important and mineral-rich Arctic island that is a semiautonomous territory of Denmark.Usage peaked Jan. 23, when there were almost 40,000 scans in one day, compared with 500 or so daily last summer. It has dropped back since but there were still around 5,000 a day this week, said Rosenfeldt, who noted ""Made O'Meter"" is used by over 20,000 people in Denmark but also by people in Germany, Spain, Italy, even Venezuela.""It's become much more personal,"" said Rosenfeldt, who spoke of ""losing an ally and a friend.""Trump announced in January he would slap new tariffs on Denmark and seven other European countries that opposed his takeover calls, only to abruptly drop his threats after he said a ""framework"" for a deal over access to mineral-rich Greenland was reached with NATO Secretary-General Mark Rutte's help. Few details of that agreement have emerged.The U.S. began technical talks in late January to put together an Arctic security deal with Denmark and Greenland, which say sovereignty is not negotiable.Rosenfeldt knows such boycotts won't damage the U.S. economy, but hopes to send a message to supermarkets and encourage greater reliance on European producers.""Maybe we can send a signal and people will listen and we can make a change,"" he added.The protest may be largely symbolic Another Danish app, ""NonUSA,"" topped 100,000 downloads at the beginning of February. One of its creators, 21-year-old Jonas Pipper, said there were over 25,000 downloads Jan. 21, when 526 product scans were performed in a minute at one point. Of the users, some 46,000 are in Denmark and around 10,000 in Germany.""We noticed some users saying they felt like a little bit of the pressure was lifted off them,"" Pipper said. ""They feel like they kind of gained the power back in this situation.""It's questionable whether such apps will have much practical effect.Christina Gravert, an associate professor of economics at the University of Copenhagen, said there are actually few U.S. products on Danish grocery store shelves, ""around 1 to 3%"". Nuts, wines and candy, for example. But there is widespread use of American technology in Denmark, from Apple iPhones to Microsoft Office tools.""If you really want to have an impact, that's where you should start,"" she said.Even ""Made O'Meter"" and ""NonUSA"" are downloaded from Apple's App Store and Google's Play Store.Gravert, who specializes in behavioral economics, said such boycott campaigns are usually short-lived and real change often requires an organized effort rather than individual consumers.""It can be interesting for big supermarket brands to say, OK, we're not going to carry these products anymore because consumers don't want to buy them,"" she said. ""If you think about large companies, this might have some type of impact on the import (they) do.""On a recent morning, shoppers leaving one Copenhagen grocery store were divided.""We do boycott, but we don't know all the American goods. So, it's mostly the well-known trademarks,"" said Morten Nielsen, 68, a retired navy officer. ""It's a personal feeling ... we feel we do something, I know we are not doing very much.""""I love America, I love traveling in America,"" said 63-year-old retiree Charlotte Fuglsang. ""I don't think we should protest that way.""","""made o'meter"" uses artificial intelligence to identify and analyze several products at a time.

$1.5 trillion lithium deposit discovered under ancient US super volcano,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/1-5-trillion-lithium-deposit-discovered-under-ancient-us-super-volcano/articleshow/128259946.cms,"Geological surveys reveal extensive lithium reserves beneath western US caldera



Geological timing points beyond simple hydrothermal origin



Resource estimates extend across much of the caldera



Strategic importance grows with battery demand





Geologists have refocused their attention on a large area of high desert in northern Nevada and southern Oregon. Researchers discovered substantial lithium mineralisation in clay-rich layers beneath the McDermitt caldera, an old supervolcano that occurred approximately 16.4 million years ago. Recent research imply that the resource could be one of the world's greatest lithium clay deposits. At Thacker Pass alone, measured and inferred resources are expected to be 533 million tonnes of ore grading around 0.29 percent lithium, equivalent to more than 1.5 million tonnes of contained lithium. Broader evaluations imply that the caldera may retain substantially more, with an in situ worth in the trillions of dollars based on current market assumptions.If confirmed at scale, the find could reshape US battery supply chains, reduce reliance on imports, and play a major role in the push toward electric vehicles and large-scale energy storage.The lithium is hosted in tuffaceous sediments that filled the caldera after its collapse. These sediments, largely derived from volcanic glass, accumulated in a closed basin environment. Over time they underwent chemical alteration through a process known as closed hydrologic system diagenesis.In the southern and western parts of the basin, entire sedimentary sections contain more than 1500 parts per million lithium. The most lithium rich zone, found in lower sedimentary layers, averages around 3000 ppm and is dominated by claystone. Researchers have identified lithium mainly within illitic clay minerals, chemically similar to tainiolite. Higher in the sequence, lithium occurs in smectite clays at slightly lower grades.According to a study published on MDPI , dating of authigenic potassium feldspar from mineralised layers yielded an age of about 14.9 million years. This is roughly 1.2 million years younger than the end of major magmatic activity in the caldera. That gap complicates a purely hydrothermal explanation tied directly to eruptive heat.Instead, evidence suggests lithium enrichment occurred during early basin sedimentation. Volcanic glass likely released lithium as it altered in alkaline groundwater within the closed basin. Some researchers argue that additional lithium may have entered the system from residual magma or volatile rich fluids during the waning stages of volcanism. The exact balance remains debated.The Thacker Pass deposit represents less than one per cent of the surface area of tuffaceous sediments within the caldera. Exploration drilling by multiple companies has identified lithium mineralisation across roughly three quarters of the basin. A government mineral resource assessment assigned similar potential throughout much of the remaining sedimentary sequence.If comparable grades extend widely, the overall resource could exceed earlier global rankings. Current published figures already place McDermitt among the world’s largest in situ lithium resources. Analysts have attached valuations reaching 1.5 trillion dollars, though actual economic recovery would depend on extraction costs, processing technology and market demand.Lithium remains a key component in lithium ion batteries used in electric vehicles and energy storage systems. Most global production comes from brines and hard rock pegmatites. Clay hosted deposits such as McDermitt represent a smaller share of known supply but may become more important as demand expands.Development work at Thacker Pass is progressing toward potential mining. Environmental review and regulatory processes continue. The scale of the deposit is clear. Its full economic and geological story is still being worked through, layer by layer.",Geologists have refocused their attention on a large area of high desert in northern nevada and southern oregon.

Jacob “Chibi Reviews” Seibers explains backlash, emotional posts, and why he says criticism motivates him





YouTuber Jacob Seibers, better known online as Chibi Reviews, is once again in the spotlight after responding directly to critics during a tense week on social media. The anime content creator said that people interacting with his posts, even those criticizing him have helped boost his visibility and earnings. His comments came just days after he posted an emotional video and a series of personal updates that drew strong reactions from fans and critics online.The situation started when Chibi Reviews shared a YouTube video titled “I lost everything,” where he talked about personal struggles, including problems in his private life and a difficult mental health moment. Soon after, he wrote several posts on X saying he had seen negative comments aimed at him. Some messages were supportive, while others were harsh, leading him to respond openly about how he handles backlash and pressure online.In his posts on X, Seibers wrote that he notices how strongly some people react to him online. He said, “Seeing how happy it would make my haters if I died I live out of spite… All your interactions have made me tremendous amounts of money spreading my name around.”His words quickly spread across social platforms and added more attention to the ongoing discussion around him.Just a day earlier, Seibers had shared emotional updates saying he felt alone after losing close relationships.In another post, he explained that he had experienced a mental health crisis and was hospitalized, later adding that he was safe and discharged.The YouTuber declared that he had returned to normalcy after experiencing a mental breakdown with help from others. The argument builds on prior disagreement from 2025, when he responded to charges leveled by an ex-girlfriend in another YouTube video. His online profile has received viewer support and criticism which resulted in his emotional outbursts.Notwithstanding the pressure, Seibers has declared he aims to keep generating content and connecting with his audience.For the moment, the circumstances include personal struggle, public opinion, and the great pressure that internet celebrity brings, something many creators say can rapidly escalate into bigger online discussions.","Youtuber jacob seibers, better known online as chibi reviews, is once again in the spotlight after responding directly to critics.

Alex Clark moves from Linus Tech Tips to Zip Tie Tuning



Jake Tivy explains why he felt it was time to leave



Jonathan Horst returns with a new channel after Mac Address

Emily Young restarts her YouTube journey independently





Several former Linus Tech Tips employees have recently stepped away from Linus Media Group and started their own YouTube channels. As the company grew into a large tech content network, many on-camera hosts and writers built loyal followings. After leaving, some shared personal stories about contracts, creative freedom, or career direction, while others quietly moved into independent content creation. Here’s a clear look at four former team members who are now building their own paths online.Alex Clark left Linus Tech Tips in June 2025 after a disagreement linked to a non-compete clause. During his time at the company, he worked mainly in writing and pre-production, helping with technical builds while occasionally appearing on camera.Later, in a video titled “Why Linus Tech Tips FIRED Us,” Clark explained that management gave him three options after his automotive channel launched.He said, “Shortly after we launched the channel, I was pulled into a meeting with management in HR… and had three options.”According to him, those options included shutting down the channel, handing it to Linus Media Group, or leaving with severance. He chose to move on and now runs Zip Tie Tuning along with a tech-focused companion channel called Zip Tie Tech.Jake Tivy joined Linus Media Group straight out of high school and later became writing team supervisor.Over time, he said the work environment changed and projects no longer felt complete from his perspective. After leaving the YouTube channel in August 2025, he launched his independent channel by the name jakkuh.In his video “Why I left Linus Tech Tips,” he explained that handing projects off made it harder to feel proud of the final results.He said, “It just made it hard to feel proud of the work I was doing.” Tivy also spoke about company growth and changing structures, which he felt affected his experience. He has since focused on building content at his own pace.Jonathan Horst became familiar to viewers as the face of Mac Address, the Apple-focused channel under Linus Media Group. Around late 2024, the channel was paused and Horst confirmed he was leaving.In a post on X, he wrote, “It was an enormous privilege to work on Mac Address.” After taking a long break, he returned in February 2026 with a new independent YouTube channel named Thinking Different.He said this new project would explore technology topics beyond just Apple products, giving him more creative room.Emily Young also left Linus Media Group and later restarted her own channel. While at LMG, she worked mainly as a writer and appeared on camera at times.In her video “I Left Linus Media Group, What do I do now?” she reflected on her experience and shared that being on camera was never her main goal.She said, “I was still making the content… being on camera was never the point.” Since leaving, she has focused on creating videos independently and shaping her own direction.","Several former linus tech tips employees have started their own youtube channels.

Twitch Plus Program explained as Kalei and Stable Ronaldo react to 70/30 revenue split concerns





Twitch’s new “Plus Program” has quickly become a big talking point among streamers after some creators said their long-standing 70/30 revenue split might be removed. The platform introduced the system as a new way to manage how subscription money is shared, and many creators immediately began asking what it means for their income. The discussion grew online after clips of streamers reacting to emails spread across X, creating confusion and concern.At its core, the Plus Program has two levels. Level 1 gives streamers a 60/40 net revenue share, while Level 2 keeps the popular 70/30 split. To reach these levels, creators must earn “Plus Points” for three months in a row. Twitch says the system is designed to standardize payouts, but reactions from streamers show many are still unsure about how the changes will affect them going forward.According to Twitch’s official support page, creators collect Plus Points through recurring subscriptions. Tier 1 subscriptions add one point, Tier 2 adds two points, and Tier 3 adds six points.Points are counted monthly from the first day of the month until the last second before the next month starts. Every month, the total resets back to zero.To qualify for Level 1, streamers must earn at least 100 points for three straight months.For the 70/30 Level 2 split, they must reach 300 points for the same period.The conversation became louder on February 13, 2026, when several streamers said they received emails suggesting changes to their payouts.Former FaZe Clan member Kalei said, “Yeah, I woke up to an email, Twitch took away my 70/30 contract that I had.”Streamer Stable Ronaldo also shared his frustration, saying, “Email, ‘Hey, we’re taking away your 70/30 soon if you don’t meet these requirements.’”Twitch later responded on X, explaining that it is “honoring historical contracts and not changing payout structure” for a limited number of long-time creators.The company described the update as a technical move to place everyone under one system and make payouts smoother.The situation comes only weeks after Twitch made headlines in January 2026 when some creators claimed their payout settings were changed after reported hacks.","Twitch’s new “plus program” has quickly become a big talking point among streamers.

Kai Cenat Breaks Silence On Mental Health In Powerful 24th Birthday Message

Kai Cenat calls out “rumors” and asks fans for respect





Twitch superstar Kai Cenat has finally addressed the storm surrounding his breakup with Gabrielle “Gigi” Alayah, weeks after their split sent social media into detective mode. The internet moved fast. Rumors multiplied. Screenshots circulated. But Cenat chose silence until now, briefly posting and deleting a message on Instagram that aimed to slow the narrative down.The relationship ended in December 2025 after a year in the public eye. What began with a birthday stream debut soon became one of Twitch’s most talked about romances. When Cenat later tweeted that he was single, speculation took over timelines. Cheating allegations, assistant drama, and fan theories blurred the line between fact and fiction.In his Instagram statement, Cenat acknowledged the chatter without diving into details. “There have been rumors, speculation, and comments made about my previous relationship and my friends,” he wrote. “I want to apologize for not addressing things sooner, but I needed to take a step back from social media and process everything.“If there’s ever something important, something real for me to address or say, you will hear it directly from me. You’ll always hear it from me. Don’t let all the noise distract from that. This applies to everything in my life. My relationships, my businesses, my streams, everything. I wish the best to Gabrielle and ask to please respect both sides.”His words arrive after Gigi publicly denied cheating claims and pushed back against online accusations. She also alleged interference from members of Cenat’s inner circle, claims that were later disputed. The back and forth only intensified interest in the breakup.The message by Cenat can be interpreted as a quest to restart the dialogue. He has created his own boundary in what he believes to be true instead of creating speculation. To avid fans of all streams and social updates, that is important. The divorce can be their secret affair, but one thing is definite. Cenat would rather have his story back.","Kai cenat has addressed rumors surrounding his breakup with gigi alayah.
