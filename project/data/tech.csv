NEW DELHI: In the increasingly complex and challenging maritime environment, where threats can emerge swiftly and often invisibly, the ability to collect, analyse and share information in real time will define both deterrence and defence, Admiral Dinesh K Tripathi said on Friday.“As India moves towards the vision of Vikshit Bharat, our maritime interests are set to increase manifold - stretching across trade, energy and connectivity. To safeguard these growing interests, our approach to maritime information must be guided by the trinity of invention, innovation, and integration,” the Navy chief said, at the commissioning of the new base INS Aravali.INS Aravali, located at Gurugram, will support different information and communication centres of the Navy, which in turn are crucial to strengthening the country’s maritime domain awareness (MDA), command and control framework.The base will also support the Navy’s Information Management and Analysis Centre (IMAC) set up in 2014, which takes feeds from multiple sources ranging from coastal radars to satellites to assess threats in the Indian Ocean Region (IOR), and the Information Fusion Centre–IOR located in Gurugram, which was established in 2018.“This new base will not only be a hub of technology, but also of collaboration linking our platforms and partners across the oceans, a true embodiment of our PM’s collaborative vision of `Mahasagar’ (mutual and holistic advancement for security and growth across regions).It will further strengthen India's role as the preferred security partner in the IOR,” Admiral Tripathi said.INS Aravali, with its motto `maritime security through collaboration’, will work seamlessly with naval warships and units, MDA centres and allied stakeholders. “It will help in facilitating vigilance to defend the country’s maritime interests,” an officer said.","Ins aravali, located at gurugram, will support different information and communication centres of the navy. The base will also support the navy’s information management and analysis centre (imac) set up in 2014. It will work seamlessly with naval warships and units, mda centres and allied stakeholders.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123862322,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1368022,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
'The Shooting of Charlie Kirk': Mysterious book on Trump ally's murder surfaces online; published day before attack,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/the-shooting-of-charlie-kirk-mysterious-book-on-trump-allys-murder-surfaces-online-published-day-before-attack/articleshow/123838352.cms,".

Charlie Kirk 'ASSASSIN' On Cam: FBI Releases Photos Of Shooting Suspect | BREAKING NEWS





Charlie Kirk, a prominent conservative activist and close ally of US President Donald Trump, was fatally shot Thursday while speaking at Utah Valley University.As law enforcement continues its manhunt for the suspect, an odd development has added to the confusion: Screenshots circulating online show a book titled “The Shooting of Charlie Kirk: A Comprehensive Account of the Utah Valley University Attack, the Aftermath, and America’s Response,” credited to an author named Anastasia J Casey.According to the screenshots, the listed publication date was September 9—one day before the shooting. The listing was allegedly visible on Amazon briefly before being removed. The images of the cover, title, and date quickly spread across X, fueling speculation about foreknowledge or a cover-up.“Can someone investigate this perhaps? It’s now pulled from Amazon online listing. Who is Anastasia Casey? Regardless of the credibility of the 9.9 publish date, how did this book get out so quick,” one user wrote.Another post read: “But check this out, another book published today? How the hell can you get a book published and up for sale in such short time ??? @FBIDirectorKash @AGPamBondi @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr.”Some users drew comparisons to past events. “A book entitled ‘The Shooting of Charlie Kirk’ by Anastasia J Casey has appeared on Amazon with a PUBLICATION DATE OF SEPTEMBER 9TH 2025. A DAY BEFORE HE WAS ASSASSINATED,” one person commented.Others pointed out more examples. “This is like the 9/11 reporting strangeness. Something is off on how quickly these people are making these books. There are 2-3 more published yesterday about Charlie's assassination. One is 36 pages,” another user noted.Amazon in a statement said that they have taken down the title in question. “We have content guidelines governing which books can be listed for sale, and we remove books that do not adhere to these guidelines. The title in question is no longer available for sale. Due to a technical issue, the date of publication that had been displayed for this title, while it was briefly listed, was incorrect, and we apologize for any confusion this may have caused. The title was published late in the afternoon on September 10th,” Amazon spokesperson told TOI.","Screenshots circulating online show a book titled “the shooting of charlie kirk: a comprehensive account of the utah valley university attack, the aftermath, and america’s response,” credited to an author named anastasia j casey.

Who is Diella? Albania appoints world’s first AI minister; public tenders to be ‘100% corruption free’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/who-is-diella-albania-appoints-worlds-first-ai-minister-public-tenders-to-be-100-corruption-free/articleshow/123852634.cms,"



Albania has made global headlines by becoming the first country to appoint an AI-powered minister. The minister, Diella, is designed to fight corruption and bring transparency to public spending.The announcement was made by Prime Minister Edi Rama, who revealed that Diella will oversee all public tenders involving private contractors on government projects.The name Diella, which means “sun” in Albanian, is a “member of the Cabinet who is not present physically but has been created virtually from artificial intelligence,” Rama told AP.Initially launched in January 2025 as a voice assistant on the e-Albania platform, Diella was created to guide citizens through government services. Since then, it has processed more than 36,000 digital documents and delivered close to 1,000 services to citizens.Now elevated to the role of minister, Diella becomes the world’s first AI minister responsible for managing decisions related to government contracts. Rama said that every public tender under Diella’s watch will be “100% corruption-free,” with full transparency on the allocation of funds.The move comes against the backdrop of Albania’s long-standing struggle with corruption.Public tenders in the Balkan nation of 2.8 million people have frequently been plagued by scandals, with international networks allegedly using the country to launder profits from drug and arms trafficking. Reports have often suggested that corruption reached the highest levels of government.By turning to an AI system, the Albanian government hopes to eliminate human bias, prevent quid pro quo arrangements, and reduce the risk of manipulation in state contracts.The appointment is also being viewed in the context of Albania’s ambition to join the European Union by 2030, for which, cracking down on corruption is a vital condition. Experts say that the introduction of Diella could strengthen Albania’s credibility with EU leaders, given that misuse of public funds has long hindered progress in membership talks.While the initiative is seen as groundbreaking, the government has yet to specify whether human oversight will accompany Diella’s decisions. Analysts warn that even advanced AI systems can be open to manipulation if not safeguarded adequately.",Albania has appointed an ai-powered minister to fight corruption.

LA Clippers minority owner involved in Kawhi Leonard's $28 million controversy

“conned”

NBA legend LeBron James is majorly minding his own business, but it became a rare sight after he jumped into a controversy that has been prevailing in the basketball world. It is none other than Kawhi Leonard's $28 million endorsement deal controversy with the environmental startup, Aspiration. The situation was roaring enough to pull the attention of King James, after a recent development that fueled the fire.Utah Jazz forward Kevin Love dropped a reel on Instagram, which showed a character wearing an American flag-themed jumpsuit. He delivered a line that referred to Kawhi Leonard's controversy. He said,To which thecharacter replies:His caption also took a jab at the situation, saying,Witnessing that, LeBron James could not help but react to the same. He dropped tons of laughing emojis and mentioned ""In Cash"" at the end of his comment.While LeBron James humorously portrayed the situation, the NBA has launched a serious investigation. Journalist Pablo Torres has also joined the fray. In recent documents he obtained, it has been alleged that Los Angeles Clippers' minority owner, Dennis Wong, had invested $2 million in Aspiration, which signed the $28 million endorsement deal with Kawhi Leonard back in April 2022 and paid him millions of dollars while ""circumventing the NBA salary cap.According to Pablo Torres, Wong put in the capital in the startup on Dec. 6, 2022, at the time they were on the verge of bankruptcy, which became a subject of debate. Moreover, the company paid Kawhi Leonard his quarterly earnings of $1.75 million as part of the agreement, the same day 20% of their employees were laid off. Furthermore, Steve Ballmer himself invested $50 million into the company, and later on claimed he wasby the top management.For the NBA, it is about finding any wrongdoings and whether the LA Clippers bent salary cap rules by utilizing shell agreements for funneling payments. So, a decisive conclusion is yet to be made on this situation, and even on Kawhi Leonard's future with the Clippers and on-court career.Also read: 7 facts about former NBA star Jason Collins who is fighting brain tumor","Lebron james reacted to kawhi leonard's $28 million endorsement deal controversy.

Alongside the Air, Apple also introduced the iPhone 17 and iPhone 17 Pro, as well as Apple Watch Series 11, Ultra 3, SE 3, and AirPods Pro 3, further solidifying its unmatched ecosystem dominance. The highly anticipated launch has generated massive worldwide buzz across social media platforms, technology forums, industry panels, tech blogs, and consumer communities alike. Among notable reactions, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman praised the iPhone Air, calling it the first Apple upgrade he’s genuinely excited about in years, highlighting its significance even to forward-thinking industry innovators and dedicated Apple fans worldwide.Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, shared his thoughts on X (formerly Twitter): “First new iPhone upgrade I have really wanted in awhile!

5 Key things you missed at Apple iPhone launch event





Following the tragic shooting of President Donald Trump aide Charlie Kirk at a rally in Utah, graphic videos of the incident quickly went viral across major social media platforms, sparking renewed scrutiny over content moderation policies. According to a report by The New York Times, within minutes of the shooting on Wednesday (September 10), videos were posted on Elon Musk 's X and were viewed over 11 million times within two hours. The graphic footage also spread to Meta-owned platforms like Instagram and Threads, as well as YouTube and Telegram, accumulating millions of views.The viral spread of the video has forced major platforms to respond, with varying approaches. Musk-owned X’s official policy prohibits “excessively gory” content but allows it to be posted with a warning label.The company posted online that it “will continue to stand against violence and censorship, ensuring this platform amplifies truth and open dialogue for everyone.”Meanwhile, Musk, who appeared to have seen some of the videos, said in a post, “The shot looked real bad, but I sure hope Charlie makes it somehow.”Google-owned YouTube said that the platform is removing some graphic content and applying age restrictions to other videos to prevent them from being seen by users under 18.“Our hearts are with Charlie Kirk’s family following his tragic death. We are closely monitoring our platform and prominently elevating news content on the homepage, in search and in recommendations to help people stay informed,” the spokesman was quoted as saying.Meta – the parent company of Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and Threads – declined to comment but some clips on its platforms were found to have been marked as sensitive, while others were not, the report said.Experts say this event continues a long-standing and troubling trend, adding that the proliferation of violent content has become a grim fixture of the internet.“This is the first time such a widely recognised figure has been murdered in such a public way and spread this way on social media,” said Emerson Brooking, director of strategy at the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council.","Graphic videos of the shooting of president donald trump aide charlie kirk quickly went viral across major social media platforms.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella admits ‘lack of empathy’ after layoffs and return-to-office push; tells employees ‘we will do better’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-admits-lack-of-empathy-after-layoffs-and-return-to-office-push-tells-employees-we-will-do-better/articleshow/123845950.cms,"Satya Nadella warns staff of long-term challenges

Microsoft’s controversy over Azure and Gaza





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has told employees that the company needs to “do better” in rebuilding trust with its workforce. The remarks come after months of layoffs and a new return-to-office rule that the company announced recently. When an employee asked Nadella to speak about a perceived lack of empathy in the company’s culture, the Microsoft CEO said “I deeply appreciate that, the question and the sentiment behind it,” as per an audio obtained by CNBC. “I take it as feedback for me and everyone in the leadership team, because at the end of the day, I think we can do better, and we will do better.”According to audio obtained by CNBC, HR chief Amy Coleman acknowledged mixed reactions to the return-to-office mandate during the session. Some employees fear a loss of autonomy, though data shows staff around Seattle already average 2.4 days in the office each week.Nadella acknowledged that remote work can make mentorship harder for new employees and interns. “Management is just mostly all remote, but the interns are all, you know, in one location. And so those are things that just will break a social contract,” he said.Still, Nadella cautioned staff about long-term challenges. “Some of the biggest businesses we built may not be as relevant going forward,” he warned. “Some of the margin that we love today may not be there tomorrow, and that means you have to be way ahead of all of those going away, right?”“We have some very, very hard work ahead of us and that hard process of renewal is essentially what we have to do,” Nadella said.“You have to be hardcore in terms of an intellectual honesty about what really needs to happen.”The meeting also touched on fallout from a Guardian report alleging that Israel’s military used Microsoft’s Azure cloud to store Palestinians’ phone calls during the Gaza conflict. Microsoft has since fired five employees who protested against the company’s involvement.President Brad Smith addressed the issue, saying Microsoft will support Jewish employees who have faced harassment. “We don’t get to control what happens outside Microsoft, but we need to be clear about one thing,” Smith said. “There is no room for antisemitism at Microsoft, and as a company and as a community, we will protect this group and defend them from that.”",Microsoft ceo satya nadella says company needs to rebuild trust with workforce.

Snake problem





Tata Electronics semiconductor manufacturing is encountering an unexpected challenge in the forests of Assam. As Tata Electronics constructs its new chip assembly facility, it is not only about ensuring meeting technical complexities of microchip production but also with the region’s wildlife, particularly Elephants and Snakes.According to a report in the Economic Times, the company is building a massive “Elephant-Proof” wall around its upcoming outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) plant in the Morigaon district. The project, which is one of the most significant under the Rs 76,000-crore India Semiconductor Mission, is receiving proactive support from the Assam state government to address these unique logistical challenges.The need for an elephant-proof wall is not just about preventing damage to equipment. Experts told Economic Times that the concern lies in the ground vibrations caused by the elephants' heavy tread. In the world of semiconductor manufacturing, where dimensions are measured in nanometers, even a minor vibration can be catastrophic.“Ground vibrations can cause misalignments in precision equipment, leading to inaccurate measurements, distorted patterns, operational failures and ultimately faulty chips,” the report states.A semiconductor industry veteran told the publication that while vibrations are not a major concern for all OSAT plants, they pose a significant threat to ""fine-pitch assembly,"" a process requiring extremely high precision. “If the vibration shifts it even by half a micron, every pin will get shifted by half a micron, the alignment will go and Tata Electronics may lose yield,” the veteran said.In addition to the elephant problem, the plant is also dealing with an abundance of Snakes. The company has hired a team of rescuers who work full-time to capture and safely relocate the reptiles. ""These people have been there for the last three months and since then have rescued many snakes,"" a source told the newspaper.The state government is taking an active role in supporting the project. According to a state official quoted, the wall is being built ""not just for the elephants but for their security as well.” The official noted that the chief minister, industry department, and chief secretary are personally overseeing the project, ensuring the Tata Group receives full support.The new chip assembly plant, which involves an investment of Rs 27,000 crore, is attracting high-profile attention, with Elon Musk’s Tesla reportedly being a key prospective customer.Experts say that industries such as semiconductor manufacturing require strict vibration control as instruments and processes demand high stability and accuracy to function correctly.

"Set yourself up for success because this is a massive transition, says Mahesh Kumar Goyal",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/pune/set-yourself-up-for-success-because-this-is-a-massive-transition-says-mahesh-kumar-goyal/articleshow/123862312.cms,"



PUNE: “Set yourself up for success because this is a massive transition,” urged Mahesh Kumar Goyal, senior data and AI engineer at Google LLC. He was invited as keynote speaker for IEEE International Conference on Information Systems and Computer Networks (ISCON 2025), which was held online on September 5 to 6, 2025.Goyal cautioned students against ignoring the wave of AI transformation sweeping industries. Instead of merely hoping their work remains unaffected, he advised them to embrace it with curiosity and strategy. He said, “Learning how to prompt, steer, and evaluate AI is quickly becoming as essential as knowing how to use a spreadsheet was 20 years ago.”Sharing a practical approach, he suggested that students dedicate time to continuous learning, especially if they feel their jobs could be at risk in the future. Referring to the 70-20-10 framework, he explained how professionals can balance the present while preparing for what’s next. According to him, 70% of time should go into excelling in one’s current role while using AI to improve it, 20% should be spent building adjacent skills, and 10% should be invested in entirely new capabilities. He said, “The security of active income and benefits will still be there, but resilience comes only if you are aggressive in learning and investing in new skills.”Goyal also reminded students that AI is not here to replace human intelligence but to augment it. By automating routine tasks, it creates room for higher-value work that machines cannot replicate. He specifically pointed to the coming impact of autonomous AI agents, predicting they will soon manage entire data analytics workflows from discovery to insight generation. This shift, he explained, elevates the human role from technician to strategist. Drawing from his own career, he shared that though he now writes less code than before, his value as a professional has only increased. He said, “Perhaps I’m technically writing less code than I did ten years ago, but I’m more indispensable.”Highlighting the skills resistant to automation, Goyal emphasized systems thinking, ethical judgment, creative problem-solving, and relationship building. These, he noted, are the qualities that will differentiate professionals in an AI-driven future.His message to students was clear: the future belongs to those who can direct and steer AI responsibly, not to those who disconnect from it.Goyal also pointed out to the coming impact of autonomous AI agents, predicting they will soon manage entire data analytics workflows from discovery to insight generation.

In a major push to modernise citizen services and reduce red tape, the UAE government has rolled out a streamlined process for renewing and replacing Emirates ID cards. Under the updated system, UAE citizens can now complete the entire procedure in a single step, with the card’s validity automatically determined based on age—mirroring the process used for Emirati passports.As part of the second cycle of the Zero Bureaucracy Programme, the Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security (ICP) has overhauled the Emirates ID services for citizens. The key change simplifies what was once a multi-step procedure into a single-step process—now limited to submitting the application and paying the service fee.This major shift is intended to eliminate bureaucratic friction, enhance the customer experience, and align with the UAE’s wider goal of delivering efficient, digital-first government services. The ICP highlighted that this move is consistent with its broader strategy to modernise smart services, shorten service journeys, and meet the public’s expectations for convenience and accessibility.A central feature of the revamped system is the automatic determination of the Emirates ID validity period, a model borrowed from the country’s passport service. The validity is assigned as follows:This applies when the service requested is renewal.In the case of replacement, the new ID card will be issued with the same validity period remaining on the existing card.

French report calls for social media ban for teenagers amid TikTok safety concerns: Why social media is under fire in France,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/french-report-calls-for-social-media-ban-for-teenagers-amid-tiktok-safety-concerns-why-social-media-is-under-fire-in-france/articleshow/123856897.cms,"France and TikTok: The inquiry and its findings

Government response and future plans





A French parliamentary commission has called for a ban on social media usage for children under 15 and proposed a nighttime “digital curfew” from 10 p.m. to 8 a.m. for teenagers aged 15 to 18. The recommendation follows a six-month inquiry into TikTok’s effects on minors, revealing that the platform exposes children to toxic, addictive, and potentially harmful content. Prompted by lawsuits from affected families and a rise in youth mental health issues and violent incidents, the report warns that social media algorithms can exacerbate stress, anxiety, and sleep problems, raising urgent concerns about children’s safety online.The investigation was prompted after seven families sued TikTok in late 2024, claiming the platform exposed their children to harmful content that contributed to self-harm and suicides. French authorities, including President Emmanuel Macron, also pointed to social media as a factor in rising youth aggression and psychological distress. Over six months, the parliamentary commission collected testimonies from affected families, child psychologists, social media executives, and influencers.TikTok was specifically criticized as “a production line of distress” due to its algorithms, which can trap teens in cycles of addictive and harmful content.The report concluded that TikTok’s moderation measures are insufficient and often bypassed easily by minors. The platform was found to negatively affect mental health, sleep patterns, and self-esteem among teenagers. Arthur Delaporte, chair of the commission, recommended investigating whether TikTok may have endangered users’ lives, under French law. In response, TikTok rejected the findings, calling them misleading and asserting that it has extensive safety programs to protect young users.While the recommendations have political support, critics raised concerns about enforceability, privacy, and potential workarounds by young users. Digital rights groups noted that strict age verification and digital curfews could be hard to implement effectively. There is also ongoing debate over whether platforms, device manufacturers, or regulators should enforce these restrictions. Despite these concerns, the urgency of protecting children’s mental health keeps the issue at the forefront of public and legislative attention.President Macron supports the social media ban for under-15s and encourages European-wide regulatory action, warning that France may act independently if necessary. Policymakers are also exploring stricter transparency, parental controls, and accountability measures for social media platforms. These steps aim to mitigate the risks of online exposure and protect minors from harmful content.","A french parliamentary commission has called for a ban on social media usage for children under 15.

In Saudi Arabia, the Iqama is more than just a residency permit — it is the central document that governs the life and work of every foreign national living in the Kingdom. From legal status to access to essential services, the Iqama plays a pivotal role in the everyday life of expatriates. This guide breaks down everything about the Iqama, from its purpose and benefits to the detailed process of obtaining and renewing it, including a breakdown of the associated costs.The Iqama is an official residency permit issued by Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Interior to foreign nationals who live and work in the country. While a person can initially enter the Kingdom on a work visa, they are unable to legally access most services until the Iqama is issued.Once granted, the Iqama acts as proof of legal residency and work authorization. It is essential for accessing basic services and conducting day-to-day transactions in the Kingdom.Though the physical Iqama card is issued for five years, its legal validity depends on annual renewal, closely tied to the employment contract and the sponsoring company. If the sponsoring company ceases operations, the Iqama becomes invalid.In such a case, the expatriate must either find a new sponsor or leave the country.The Iqama issuance process is structured and primarily handled by the employer or business owner acting as the sponsor. Here’s how the process works:Holding an Iqama comes with recurring fees, which are usually covered by the employer. These include issuance charges, work permit fees, and dependent levies for family members.These figures apply annually and may vary if the residency period is shorter. Employers typically bear the full financial responsibility, including repatriation costs if the employment contract ends","The iqama is an official residency permit issued by saudi arabia’s ministry of interior to foreign nationals who live and work in the country.
