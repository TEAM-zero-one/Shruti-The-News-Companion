HYDERABAD: It's not just the country's western border that took heavy enemy fire during Operation Sindoor .

The attempt was to both embarrass India and also extract sensitive information about its defence systems, including its missiles, they said.According to Interpol trainer and cyber forensic expert Pendyala Krishna Shastry, the attacks were part of a broader campaign waged by Pakistani actors against Indian digital assets. These groups reportedly deployed malware, conducted phishing attacks, and launched denial-of-service operations targeting critical sectors such as finance, telecom, energy, and public services.Zone-H, a website that tracks defacements, reported incidents involving Indian govt domains.

Light No Fire Official Reveal Trailer From Hello Games | The Game Awards 2023

Gameplay tricks and tips

EVERYTHING You Need To Know About Light No Fire In 2025 So Far!!

In the ever-changing landscape of open-world gaming , the creators of No Man's Sky , Hello Games , are setting their sights on a new and bolder frontier. With Light No Fire, the studio is not simply building an exploration game; it attempts to reimagine what it means to survive, explore, and create in a fantasy universe fashioned to mirror Earth in its sheer scale and complexity. And this time, there are no galaxies, only one earth teeming with opportunities.While No Man’s Sky created an entire universe with billions upon billions of procedurally generated planets, Light No Fire zooms up close and personal to the workings of a single handcrafted-and-automatically-procedural-gen planet. But don’t let ""for one"" fool you. Ostensibly called ""multiplayer Earth"" by its creators, the designers propose something vast enough to span hundreds of millions of square miles-the real equivalent area needed to accommodate Earth's population. It's not just a sandbox; it's a continent-spanning wilderness with oceans as deep and dark as ours and mountains towering far beyond what one usually sees in games.While No Man's Sky uses science fiction for style, Light No Fire uses fantasy-far far away in lore, ancient ruins, magical creatures, and gigantic biomes. Players are not mere scavengers or colonists but rather roam freely as adventurers through a land that invites curiosity at every corner. The RPG features include character customization from diverse species, ranging even to anthropomorphic rabbits.Though Light No Fire can be enjoyed by a single player, Hello Games much more strongly stresses the shared experience. This is not just a skill-based competitive survival game. Rather, it is a cooperative effort to settle, explore, and conceptualize a shared vast world. The game's choice of design basically invites players to cooperate in communities and to embark on quests that are given by NPCs sitting in scattered outposts. It is not about domination; it is co-existence.And that is an incredibly meaningful message coming from a studio that has slowly but surely been earning back the trust of gamers since a rocky launch in 2016.Arguably the greatest differentiator with Light No Fire is how the game itself is undergoing revelation. After a host of accusations against the studio for early overhype in past games, Hello Games has learned to extend marketing campaigns. With five years of development already behind it, the studio has quietly been working towards what may well be one of the most extensive and imaginative open-world games of the decade.No release date has ever been announced, but the upper hand still lies with a late-2025 launch. Should Light No Fire live up to at least half of what it intends to do, the magic of discovery in games may just get revived again.","Light no fire attempts to reimagine what it means to survive, explore, and create in a fantasy universe fashioned to mirror earth.

Nintendo balances pricing against adoption goals

Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa expressed concerns that the company may need to increase the price of the upcoming Switch 2 console in the United States due to recently implemented tariffs on Chinese imports. The revelation came during Nintendo's May 8 earnings call, just weeks before the console's scheduled June 5 launch.""If the assumptions regarding tariffs change significantly, we would like to consider what price adjustments we should make and implement them after considering various aspects,"" Furukawa stated, addressing the potential impact on the already premium-priced $449.99 console.Nintendo's forecast assumes tariffs of 10% on products from Japan, Vietnam, and Cambodia, while Chinese imports face a staggering 145% tariff (as of now, US and China are renegotiating the trade terms, which possibly could lower the tariff). The company expects these trade measures to impact profits by ""tens of billions of yen.""Furukawa highlighted broader economic concerns beyond direct manufacturing costs. ""If prices of daily necessities like food increase (because of the tariffs), then people will have less money to spend on game consoles. If we were to adjust the price of the Switch 2, this could decrease demand.""While Nintendo primarily manufactures Switch hardware for North America in Vietnam, certain accessories and amiibo figures come from China, subjecting them to higher tariff rates.Despite these challenges, Nintendo forecasts selling 15 million Switch 2 units in its first year – matching the original Switch's debut performance – though analysts describe this projection as ""conservative"" given the tariff uncertainties.The company faces a delicate balancing act between covering increased costs and maintaining consumer interest. ""Nintendo will carefully consider various factors when changing any pricing, including its acceptability to customers,"" Furukawa emphasized.The Switch 2 isn't alone in facing potential price hikes. Microsoft has already increased Xbox Series S prices by $80 and Series X by $100, while some smaller gaming hardware companies have suspended U.S. shipments entirely due to prohibitive tariff costs.Pre-orders for the Switch 2 opened on April 24 following a brief delay related to tariff concerns, with Nintendo warning that release-day delivery cannot be guaranteed due to overwhelming d","Nintendo president shuntaro furukawa expressed concerns that the company may need to increase the price of the upcoming switch 2 console.

'Military-linked company'





HONG KONG: Chinese EV battery giant CATL aims to raise $4 billion in its Hong Kong listing scheduled for May 20, said a statement filed to the bourse Monday, making it the largest IPO expected in the city so far this year.A global leader in the sector, CATL produces more than a third of all electric vehicle (EV) batteries sold worldwide, working with major brands including Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen.The company is already listed in Shenzhen, and its plan for a secondary listing in Hong Kong was announced in a December filing with the stock exchange.According to a prospectus filed Monday, CATL will offer approximately 117.9 million units priced at up to HK$263 per share ($33.8) for total expected proceeds of HK$31.01 billion.The listing is set to take place next Tuesday (May 20).Cornerstone investors, including Sinopec and Kuwait Investment Authority, agreed to buy shares worth HK$2.62 billion, the prospectus shows.Founded in 2011 in the eastern Chinese city of Ningde, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (CATL) was initially propelled to success by rapid growth in the domestic market.But the world's largest EV market has more recently begun to show signs of flagging sales amid a broader slowdown in consumption.The trends have fuelled a fierce price war in China's expansive EV sector, putting smaller firms under huge pressure to compete while remaining financially viable.But CATL continues to post solid performances, with its net profit jumping 32.9 percent in the first quarter.Funds raised from a secondary listing could be used to accelerate CATL's overseas expansion, particularly in Europe.The battery giant is building its second factory on the continent in Hungary after launching its first in Germany in January 2023.In December, CATL announced that it would work with automotive giant Stellantis on a $4.3 billion factory to make EV batteries in Spain, with production slated to begin by the end of 2026.Earlier analysts said CATL's float could be a blockbuster initial public offering that could boost Hong Kong's fortunes as a listing hub.Hong Kong's stock exchange is eager for the return of big-name Chinese listings in hopes of regaining its crown as the world's top IPO venue.The Chinese finance hub saw a steady decline in new offerings since Beijing's regulatory crackdown starting in 2020 led some Chinese mega-companies to put their plans on hold.In a list issued in January by the US Defense Department, CATL was designated as a ""Chinese military company"".The United States House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party highlighted this inclusion in letters to two American banks in April, urging them to withdraw from the IPO deal with the ""Chinese military-linked company"".But the two American banks JPMorgan and Bank of America are still on the deal.Beijing has denounced the list as ""suppression"", while CATL denied engaging ""in any military related activities"".According to Bloomberg, CATL plans to make the deal as a ""Reg S"" offering, which doesn't allow sales to US onshore investors, limiting the company's exposure to legal risks in the United States.",Chinese ev battery giant catl aims to raise $4 bn in hong kong ipo.

Performance



British fashion giant Burberry announced plans to slash almost one fifth of its global workforce, laying off 1,700 employees. The move comes as a major cost saving move to revive the company’s performance.The cuts come as part of a broader shake-up under chief executive officer Joshua Schulman, who joined the company last year to reverse its years of underperformance and put Burberry back on course.The majority of the job losses will affect office-based roles, and a night shift at the company’s Castleford trench coat factory in England will be scrapped due to overproduction.“Our brand metrics have all shown a significant improvement in the second half versus the first half,” Schulman told journalists on a call, quoted by Reuters.The former Jimmy Choo boss has transitioned Burberry’s focus back to its heritage staples, particularly trench coats and scarves, after previous missteps including aggressive pricing and unclear brand positioning.He has also pinned his hopes on leather accessories which have a higher margin and on designer Daniel Lee.Between 2017 and 2021, the group was run by Marco Gobbetti and designer Riccardo Tisci, the company had tried to establish the group as a high end luxury fashion brand, however, it did not yield much financial success.Schulman replaced Jonathan Akeroyd and is the fourth CEO of the brand in a decade.The shake-up news and better than expected financial results sent the brand’s shares sparing 8% in early trading following the update and better-than-expected financial results. For the financial year ending 29 March 2025, Burberry reported an adjusted operating profit of £26 million, well above analyst expectations of £11 million, helping the brand narrowly avoid a loss.However, the broader luxury market downturn remains a concern. Comparable sales fell 6% in the fourth quarter, though this was slightly better than the 7% drop analysts had forecast.Region wise categorisation showed that sales in the Americas and the Europe, Middle East, India and Africa region, each declined 4% against last year. Similarly, sales in the Asia Pacific area also plunged 9%.Schulman admitted that US consumer behaviour in particular had shown signs of softening. “As we got into Q4, the US customer was keeping their momentum but ... things got a little choppy as we headed into February, particularly in the US market,” he said.The US currently accounts for 19% of Burberry’s clients. While the company did not comment on the potential impact of US tariffs, it did flag “geopolitical developments” as a factor contributing to economic uncertainty. No concrete financial targets were set for the 2026 fiscal year.","The majority of the job losses will affect office-based roles.

Capex alloted to renewable

MUMBAI: Tata Power plans to bid for two electricity distribution companies in Uttar Pradesh — Dakshinanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam and Purvanchal Vidyut Vitran Nigam — once tender documents are released, said MD Praveer Sinha. This move supports Tata Power’s goal to grow its transmission and distribution (T&D) business, which brings in most of its revenue and a large share of its profits.“Based on our discussions, bid documents are being finalised and are expected by the end of the month. They (UP) are looking to privatise two discoms — Dakshinanchal and Purvanchal — which will be divided into six circles. We will participate actively when the documents are available,” Sinha said.Currently, Tata Power manages electricity distribution in Mumbai, Delhi, Ajmer, and Odisha, serving 12.5 million customers. It aims to have a base of 40 million in 5 years. UP’s goal is to cut losses and improve efficiency in these two discoms. Most likely, govt will choose a public-private partnership , with private companies holding majority stake.Dakshinanchal and Purvanchal serve 42 of UP’s 75 districts. Tata Power improved the financial health of the discoms after it checked into them, which also positions it to capitalise on opportunities arising in the power distribution space. For instance, the profit of the Odisha discom, in which it holds 51% and the Odisha govt owns 49%, increased by 86%, reaching Rs 439 crore in FY25 from Rs 236 crore in FY22. Odisha discom came under Tata Power’s management between June 2020 and April 2021.Tata Power, which plans to enter the small modular nuclear reactor business, is waiting for legal clarity before moving ahead. “We are awaiting amendments to the Nuclear Power Act — specifically civil liability and private sector participation. We expect the amendments to be discussed during the monsoon session. We are preparing with site evaluations, water arrangements, and technology reviews, but our next steps depend on legal clarity,” Sinha said. Tata Steel & Tata Motors, are potential customers for the nuclear power that Tata Power intends to offer as part of its clean energy solution.It plans to spend Rs 25,000 crore on capital expenditure in FY26. Sinha said 50% of this amount will be allocated to renewables, 20% to generation, and 30% to T&D. In FY25, it spent Rs 16,000 crore on capex, falling short of the Rs 20,000-crore target. The reduced spend was attributed to delays in transmission and renewable projects, according to the leadership.Tata Power plans to exit Tata Projects, the contractor that built Parliament building after independence, as it wants to focus on its main businesses. “Tata Power is focused on growth in core businesses: renewables, hydro, transmission, and distribution. We need capital for this, so we have chosen not to allocate funds to non-core ventures,” said Sinha.","Tata power plans to bid for two electricity distribution companies in uttar pradesh.

What drives external commerical borrowing

MUMBAI: In a strong signal of rising investment in India’s private sector, manufacturing and finance companies received approval to raise a record $11 billion through external commercial borrowings (ECBs) in March 2025. This marks the highest monthly ECB inflow in more than five years, according to data released by RBI.Of the total amount, about $8.3 billion was approved through the automatic route, while nearly $2.7 billion was approved through the approval route. The surge in ECBs highlights the growing confidence in India’s economic prospects and its ability to attract foreign capital.Several prominent companies were among the top recipients of ECB approvals in March. Yuzhan Technology (India), a subsidiary of Taiwan’s Foxconn Group, received approval to raise $220 million for working capital needs. Established in late 2023, Yuzhan focuses on the manufacturing of computer, electronic, and optical products. JSW Steel received approval to raise $900 million to refinance an earlier ECB, while ONGC Videsh and MRPL each received approval to raise $450 million and $500 million, respectively, for similar refinancing purposes.

UnitedHealth Group announced Tuesday that CEO Andrew Witty is stepping down for personal reasons as the company grapples with unexpectedly high medical costs and withdraws its full-year financial outlook for 2025.Chairman Stephen Hemsley will return as CEO, effective immediately. Hemsley, who previously served in the role from 2006 to 2017, will continue as chairman of the company’s board. Witty, 60, will remain with the company as a senior adviser, as per news agency AP.UnitedHealth’s decision comes during a turbulent time for the healthcare giant, which has faced growing scrutiny and financial headwinds in recent months. In December, executive Brian Thompson was killed outside a New York City hotel. While the incident was not tied to the company’s financial operations, it sent shockwaves through the corporate world and was followed by a dramatic decline in UnitedHealth shares.“I’m deeply disappointed in and apologize for the performance setbacks we have encountered from both external and internal challenges,” Hemsley said during an early Tuesday conference call.“Many of the issues standing in the way of achieving our goals as well as our opportunities are largely within our control. I am optimistic about our future as these issues are within our capacity to resolve. We will approach them with humility, rigor and urgency. ”Witty joined UnitedHealth in 2018 after a nearly decade-long tenure as CEO of British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline. He took over the helm of UnitedHealth in February 2021, succeeding Dave Wichmann.Under Witty’s leadership, UnitedHealth experienced significant growth. The company’s revenue soared to more than $400 billion last year, a 55% jump from the $257 billion it posted the year before he became CEO. Its stock price also surged during that period, rising 60.5%.However, the last several months have marked a period of considerable challenge. UnitedHealth cut its financial forecast last month following its first quarterly earnings miss in over a decade. On Tuesday, the company withdrew its full-year guidance entirely, citing higher-than-expected medical expenses tied to newly enrolled Medicare Advantage members.The backdrop of rising costs and public scrutiny has added to investor unease. The ongoing high-profile case surrounding Luigi Mangione, who was indicted last month on federal murder charges in the death of Thompson, has stirred national attention and contributed to a broader wave of criticism toward health insurers.Shares of UnitedHealth have fallen sharply—down 38% since Thompson’s killing on December 4—plunging more than 16% on Tuesday to their lowest levels in nearly five years.UnitedHealth Group Inc. serves more than 50 million Americans through its various health insurance offerings. In addition to its core insurance operations, it runs a major pharmacy benefit manager and its Optum division, which provides healthcare services and technical infrastructure.The company is also the nation’s largest provider of Medicare Advantage plans, with over 8 million enrollees in privately run versions of the government health program for seniors.","Unitedhealth group announced tuesday that ceo andrew witty is stepping down for personal reasons.

The cumulative funding for more than 31,000 tech start ups has exceeded $70 billion (from 2019 to 2023)","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-107262111,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-64556,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New york-based air company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol.
