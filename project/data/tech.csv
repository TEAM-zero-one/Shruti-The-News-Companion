Boxing earnings fuel Manny Pacquiao’s massive fortune

Endorsements amplify Manny Pacquiao’s global brand

Political career adds to Manny Pacquiao’s influence but not wealth

Manny Pacquiao, the Filipino boxing star, had built a vast fortune by 2025, inspiring millions around the world. His net worth is around $220 million, thanks to his incredible journey from a poor kid to a global hero. Known as “PacMan,” he made money through boxing, brand deals, and politics.Manny Pacquiao's boxing career is the biggest reason for his massive wealth, earning him millions over the years. As the only boxer to win world titles in eight weight classes, he made about $575 million from his fights. His 2015 fight against Floyd Mayweather alone brought in $130 million. His 25 pay-per-view fights earned $1.3 billion total, proving how popular he is worldwide.Even at the age of 46, Pacquiao keeps fighting, like his July 2025 draw against Mario Barrios, which earned him around $12.5 million. His exciting style and wins against stars like Miguel Cotto and Oscar De La Hoya made him a fan favorite. Pay-per-view shares also added to his fortune, making him one of the richest boxers ever. His hard work in the ring built a strong financial foundation for his life.Also Read: Manny Pacquiao dares to defy age with bold move to steal Mario Barrios' WBC title Pacquiano became a target of major brands due to his fame, and his net worth was boosted by endorsements to the tune of millions.During his prime, companies such as Nike, Nestlé, and Hennessy paid him annually between 2 and 5 million dollars. In his fight with Mayweather, companies such as Paramount Pictures and Smart Communications also purchased advertising space on his shorts to the tune of $300,000 apiece. In 2016, Nike dumped him, and he joined the Chinese ANATA brand.Being a clean image and with a massive following, and more so in the Philippines, he was ideal for marketing. He, too, began Manny Pacquiao Promotions to help the young boxers, which is another source of revenue. Team Pacquiao Coffee and real estate are other business activities that contribute to his wealth. These transactions demonstrate how Pacquiao has built his brand of fame beyond the boxing ring.Pacquiao earned some respect through his work in politics, but could not significantly contribute to his wealth as compared to boxing. He represented the Philippines in the Senate between 2016 and 2022 and made approximately $40,000 a year, a modest sum when compared to his fight purse. His 2022 presidential campaign and 2025 Senate bid were not successful, but kept him in the limelight. These positions made his image, but they were not mega-grossers.He pays it back through his Manny Pacquiao Foundation, where he finances homes and scholarships to the poor. He also has a Beverly Hills mansion worth $12.5 million and houses in the Philippines. Politics did not make him wealthy; however, it reinforced his reputation as a popular personality. The combination of charity, investments, and service to the people demonstrates that he left a non-monetary legacy.","Manny pacquiao, the filipino boxing star, had built a vast fortune by 2025.

What Happens Next





NEW DELHI: With the govt announcing sweeping GST rate reductions on nearly 400 goods and services, companies across sectors are working to adjust prices and pass on the benefits to consumers by the Sept 22 implementation date.TOI spoke to companies and industry experts to understand how different sectors plan to pass on the GST cuts.Under the GST framework, tax is applied at multiple stages of production and distribution. Companies claim input tax credit (ITC) on GST paid for inputs. However, once goods are manufactured and invoiced, the applicable GST is locked in - based on the rate at the time of sale.This means goods already dispatched to dealers before Sept 22 carry price tags that reflect the old tax rate. Adjusting those prices midstream requires coordination across manufacturers, distributors, and retailers.""Trade promotions and schemes may need recalibration. Distributors might seek credit adjustments for inventory purchased at higher GST rates. Companies also need to update ERP systems, billing software, and point-of-sale terminals,"" said Naveen Malpani, partner and consumer industry leader at Grant Thornton Bharat.While large retail chains can adapt quickly thanks to integrated technology platforms, smaller stores and traditional kirana retailers may face difficulties updating systems in time, he added.The govt has made it clear the objective is to benefit the end consumer. ""This reform has been implemented with a consumer-centric lens. GST, being embedded in the price paid by the consumer, is being recalibrated to deliver that benefit directly,"" said MS Mani, partner at Deloitte India.Here's a sector-by-sector snapshot:In the fast-moving consumer goods segment, strategy depends on product pricing. For fixed-price packs (for example, Rs 5 or Rs 10 namkeens and biscuits), companies are expected to increase grammage rather than cut prices, to retain the psychological price point.For other items such as shampoos, soaps, and toothpaste, revised stickers will be placed once the new rates come into force. Pricing differences on old inventory will be adjusted through the credit note system between manufacturers, distributors, and retailers - ensuring that frontline sellers aren't burdened.White goods companies - selling TVs, ACs, refrigerators, and washing machines - are optimistic about the changes. The GST on these items drops from 28% to 18%, and firms are expecting a demand boost ahead of the festival season.Many companies had proactively assured dealers they would bear the losses on unsold inventory billed under old rates. For example, an air conditioner billed at Rs 20,000 earlier attracted Rs 5,600 GST (28%). Under the revised rate, the tax drops to Rs 3,600. To avoid a Rs 2,000 hit per unit post-Sept 22, some manufacturers are willing to compensate.Hotel room rates belowRs 7,500 a night will attract 5% GST, down from 12%. However, only customers opting to pay at check-in will benefit. If the room was paid for in advance, the service is treated as already rendered under earlier rates - even if the stay is after Sept 22.Similarly, GST on premium economy, business and first class air tickets is being increased from 12% to 18%. Tickets paid for before Sept 22 will continue under old rates.Health and life insurance policies purchased by individuals will now be fully exempt from GST. This translates into an 18% notional savings for consumers. However, insurers have raised concerns. As input tax credit on goods and services used by them - such as printing, IT, transport - has been withdrawn, they may no longer be able to offset those costs.Some insurers are considering value-adds (for instance, enhanced room eligibility or personal accident cover) when an existing policy is renewed, instead of cutting premiums. Govt officials are nudging industry to ensure benefits by way of lower premiums reaching policyholders. While many insurers may initially pass on benefits, they are also evaluating adjustments in future pricing.This segment is an outlier - facing significant temporary distress because of anticipated GST cuts. Several car dealers have flagged losses due to high inventory levels built up after PM Narendra Modi's Aug 15 announcement that rate cuts were being considered.Now, with cess structures revised, dealers fear steep losses on unsold vehicles. For instance, a car previously taxed at 50% (28% GST + 22% cess) will now attract 40% tax - but with dealers already paying the cess on old stock, they can't claim refunds. They will also have to pay 12% additional GST on some models, leaving them staring at a hit.Manufacturers in the auto sector have not universally committed to protecting dealers. Some have offered partial support, but many dealers feel exposed. Industry bodies are in discussions with the govt seeking relief.From updating billing software and reprinting stickers to issuing credit notes and managing dealer expectations, businesses are navigating complex operational challenges. Govt, meanwhile, will monitor compliance to ensure that the benefits of tax cuts are passed on.","Companies across sectors are working to adjust prices and pass on the benefits to consumers.

Diwali Gift for Consumers: Govt Slashes GST Across Sectors, Prices to Drop from Sept 22

Bikes

Electric Vehicles

Health Insurance





Cigarettes and tobacco



Alcohol

Gold

Mobile Phones





The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council, chaired by Union finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman, on Wednesday announced the most extensive revamp of the indirect tax system since its rollout in 2017.The reform introduces a simplified two-slab structure of 5% and 18%, alongside a new 40% slab for luxury and sin goods.The new rates, except for tobacco where cess continues, take effect from September 22, the first day of Navratri.Revenue secretary Arvind Shrivastava estimated the net fiscal implication of the changes at Rs 48,000 crore. He added the measures are designed to spur consumption and improve compliance.Sitharaman underlined that the reforms were aimed at the common man, stating, “Every tax levied on common man’s daily use items have undergone a rigorous look, and in most cases, the rates have come down drastically”.Buyers of small cars stand to benefit the most. Small cars will now attract 18% GST, reduced from the earlier 29% (28% plus 1% cess).For GST purposes, small cars are defined as petrol, LPG or CNG vehicles with an engine capacity of up to 1200 cc and length up to 4000 mm.In the case of diesel cars, the definition covers vehicles with engine capacity up to 1500 cc and length not exceeding 4000 mm.Large vehicles exceeding 1500 cc or longer than 4000 mm will fall into the new 40% GST slab.The same rate will also apply to all utility vehicles, including SUVs, MUVs, MPVs and cross-over vehicles, provided they have an engine capacity above 1500 cc, a length over 4000 mm, and a ground clearance of 170 mm or more.Unlike the earlier regime that combined 28% GST with a 17–22% cess, the new framework consolidates this into a single 40% rate without cess.Two-wheelers have also seen a rationalisation. Motorcycles up to 350 cc engine capacity will attract 18% GST, reduced from 28%. The 18% rate also applies to 350 cc models.Motorcycles exceeding 350 cc engine capacity have been placed in the 40% bracket, aligning them with the treatment of luxury and high-powered vehicles.This change is expected to encourage mass-market two-wheeler sales, especially in rural and urban middle-class markets, while continuing to tax premium motorcycles at a higher rate.Electric cars remain unchanged, continuing to be taxed at 5%.A major relief comes for individuals purchasing life and health insurance. These policies will now be exempt from GST. Earlier, these services attracted 18%, adding to premium costs.Exemption is expected to make policies more affordable, widening insurance coverage in a country where penetration levels remain low.The GST Council has shifted cigarettes, cigars, pan masala, and chewing tobacco into the 40% slab.However, until compensation cess loans are fully repaid, the existing 28% GST plus cess regime will continue.Analysts noted that revenue neutrality is a priority for the government, as cigarette taxation contributes significantly to exchequer inflows. The move balances public health concerns with the need to curb illicit trade.Alcohol remains outside the purview of GST altogether. It continues to be taxed separately through state excise duties, meaning the GST overhaul has no bearing on alcohol pricing.States will retain autonomy in setting alcohol taxes, a key revenue source for their budgets.There has been no change in the taxation of precious metals. Gold and silver jewellery remain taxed at 3%, with an additional 5% GST on making charges. Gold bars and coins also continue to face 3% GST.With no direct impact from GST 2.0, demand in the bullion market is expected to remain steady, especially during the festive season when purchases peak.Despite repeated industry requests, mobile phones remain taxed at 18%. ET reported that the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) had sought a 5% slab, calling the current levy “regressive” and reminding that pre-GST state VAT on mobiles was mostly capped at 5%.Despite the wider rate cuts across consumer goods, mobile phones remain at 18% GST, unchanged under the new regime. As per ET, the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA) had urged for a 5% slab, calling the current levy “regressive.”The industry argued that mobile phones are a basic digital necessity, not a luxury.ICEA highlighted that pre-GST, most states had capped VAT at 5%. With domestic production rising to Rs 5.45 lakh crore in FY25 and exports crossing Rs 2 lakh crore, industry bodies stressed that lower GST would have boosted affordability and domestic demand.","The goods and services tax (gst) council announced the most extensive revamp of the indirect tax system since its rollout in 2017.

Sydney Sweeney’s viral denim campaign set the tone for American Eagle’s comeback

Travis Kelce’s timing with Taylor Swift spotlight amplified American Eagle’s momentum



American Eagle’s latest financial surge is proof that celebrity influence can reshape an entire brand’s future. In 2025, the clothing retailer posted a remarkable 25% stock jump after its second-quarter earnings, and executives credited the success directly to the star-driven campaigns led by actress Sydney Sweeney and NFL star Travis Kelce.Sydney Sweeney, best known for her role in Euphoria, became the centerpiece of American Eagle’s summer campaign with the tagline “Sydney has great jeans.” The cheeky play on words worked brilliantly—her branded denim line sold out within days, with some pieces disappearing in less than 24 hours.Chief Marketing Officer Craig Brommers told investors, “Sydney Sweeney sells great jeans,” framing the collaboration as not just a product push but a “brand and business reset.”The campaign dominated social platforms like TikTok, seeped into late-night comedy skits, and even caught the attention of former President Donald Trump, who called the ads “fantastic.” The buzz, however, came with controversy, sparking culture-war debates online about the objectification of celebrities in marketing.But for American Eagle, the results spoke for themselves—billions of impressions and a sudden return to cultural relevance.Hot on the heels of Sweeney’s viral success, American Eagle launched its men’s line campaign with Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce. Fresh from his engagement to Taylor Swift, Kelce brought a wave of media attention that no marketing budget could buy. His playful post, “Rockin’ AE’s new fits—comfort meets style, let’s go!” was shared widely, and Swift’s fanbase amplified the campaign, driving millions of organic impressions.Also Read: Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift’s big day may not include Chiefs teammate after sexist comments ignites outrage Together, Sweeney and Kelce generated an estimated 40 billion impressions for the brand.

On Thursday, September 4, 2025, the 25-year-old linebacker signed a four-year extension with the team worth up to $120 million with $70 million guaranteed, per NFL Network's Ian Rapoport. It was a contract his agency stated they would not have agreed to if it weren't for Bonitto's stellar reputation. He was set to enter the final year of his rookie deal, but Bonitto's extension now has him with the Denver Broncos through 2029 and with a guaranteed to average $26.5 million per season, he will be one of the top 10 highest-paid edge rushers in the league.Nik Bonitto's big payday comes a year after starting a career year in 2024. In 2024, he was a full-time starter for the first time in his career, he had 13.5 sacks and 48 tackles during the season, he also had a 71-yard pick-six against the Indianapolis Colts.His production earned him a Pro Bowl and a Second-Team All-Pro selection in 2024. Bonitto was drafted in the second round of the 2022 NFL Draft from Oklahoma. Across three seasons, he has recorded 23 sacks and 92 tackles in 47 games.Speaking after the extension, General Manager George Paton said the Broncos “were not going to let a player like Nik get away,” showing how central he is to the team’s long-term plans.The Broncos have made defense their top priority, and Nik Bonitto is now the centerpiece. Patrick Surtain II, Jonathon Cooper, and Zach Allen have all received extensions and now the Broncos have one of the best pass-rush groups in the NFL. Bonitto's teammates said he has energy and leads the rushers. “He pushes everyone to be better every day,” defensive back Patrick Surtain II said earlier this summer.With his new deal signed, Bonitto will next take the field in the 2025 season opener on Sunday against the Tennessee Titans in Denver. Fans are expecting him to anchor a defense that finished third in the NFL in points allowed last season.","Nik bonitto agrees to four-year extension, stays with broncos through 2029.

I do not make any of my own clothing. I speak a language I did not invent or refine. I did not discover the mathematics I use. I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate.

I am moved by music I did not create myself. When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive. I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with.I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being.

Gmail Warning: That Urgent Security Notification from Google May Be a Trap

Eugene Ling , a former sales employee at Scale AI, has issued a public apology to his current team and employer, Mercor , after a report emerged that his ex-company is suing them. The lawsuit, filed two months after Scale AI secured a massive $14.3 billion investment from Mark Zuckerberg's Meta, accuses Ling of stealing confidential documents containing customer strategies and other proprietary information.“Just heard I’m getting sued by Scale. Last month, I left Scale to work at Mercor. I know this was frustrating for my old team, and I feel bad about that,” Ling said in a post.Ling also denies any “nefarious intent.” He stated that after leaving Scale, he asked his former employer if he could delete files from his personal drive, but was instructed not to.“When Scale reached out about some files I had in my personal drive, I asked if I could just delete them. But Scale asked that I not do anything with them, so I’m still waiting for guidance on how to resolve this. I’ve never used any of them in this role. It sounds like Scale wants to sue me and that’s up to them,” he said.“I’m really sorry to my new team at Mercor for having to deal with this,” he added.Ling’s post came after a report by TechCrunch said that Scale AI’s lawsuit alleges that Ling ""stole more than 100 confidential documents concerning Scale’s customer strategies and other proprietary information"" and attempted to poach one of Scale’s largest clients for Mercor.Surya Midha, co-founder of Mercor, told the publication that Ling may have had possession of the documents but denied that his company had used any of the data.“We have no interest in any of Scale’s trade secrets and in fact are intentionally running our business in a different way,” Midha said. He also revealed that Mercor had reached out to Scale AI days before the lawsuit was filed, offering to have Ling destroy the files.Scale AI's lawsuit claims that the stolen documents contained data that would have allowed Mercor to serve several of its most important clients, including a major customer, referred to in the suit as ""Customer A."" Scale alleges that winning this client away would be “worth millions of dollars to Mercor.”The legal action comes just weeks after Meta's significant investment in Scale AI. Zuckerberg’s company now holds 49% of Scale AI and also hired its CEO Alexandr Wang as well as some other employees as part of the deal.

Lucy Guo dropped out of college

How Lucy Guo learnt to earn money as a kid

Lucy Guo , world's youngest self-made billionaire and serial entrepreneur, credits her frugal parents with motivating her to start hustling at a young age. Guo, 30, was recently named Forbes' youngest self-made billionaire with a net worth of $1.3 billion. Her first company, Scale AI, an AI data-labeling firm, was acquired by tech giant Meta for a whopping $25 billion.Today, Lucy Guo is the founder of Passes, a content creator monetization platform launched in 2022. She also founded a venture capital firm, Backend Ventures, in 2019 to invest in early-stage tech startups. Growing up in Fremont, California, with Chinese immigrant parents, Guo was taught the importance of both education and money. ""They threw me into Abacus competitions,"" she told CNBC Make It, adding that she was ""definitely forced to have good academics.""Her focus on academics led her to study computer science and human-computer interaction at Carnegie Mellon University. However, she dropped out after two years, with only a year left to complete her Computer Science degree. This decision was a major disappointment for her parents.""They sacrificed everything to immigrate from China to America to give their kids a better future,"" Guo explained. ""For their kids to suddenly let go of their education when they were almost done was like a slap in the face.""Instead of finishing her degree, Guo pursued the Thiel Fellowship , a program that provides young people with $200,000 to build innovative companies. ""I think they [parents] viewed that as a sign that I didn't love them,"" she said, ""when it was just me making a bet on myself and choosing to optimize for what I thought would be a better future for myself.""Lucy Guo’s parents lived ""a very frugal life,"" but always emphasized the importance of having money. As a result, she started hustling in elementary school. ""I would find ways to make money on the playground,"" she said. This included trading and selling Pokémon cards, colored pencils, and ""anything I could find.""Her parents were strict, and if she misbehaved, they would take her money away. In response, Guo, in second grade, went to Home Depot to get a debit card and opened a PayPal account to store her cash.As the years went on, her money-making endeavors grew. A fan of the game Neopets, she would sell virtual creatures and in-game currency on forums. ""I would get rare pets, rare items, and resell them for actual cash,"" she said.After discovering engineering and coding, she began making and selling bots to cheat in games. From there, her ventures ""snowballed."" ""I then started finding other ways to make money on the internet from making websites using Google AdSense, then creating internet marketing tools...it just snowballed from there,"" she is quoted as saying.","Lucy guo, 30, was recently named forbes' youngest self-made billionaire with a net worth of $1.3 billion.

‘No tax on tips’: Streamers and influencers included in the US Act; mid-level creators benefit,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/no-tax-on-tips-streamers-and-influencers-included-in-the-us-act-mid-level-creators-benefit/articleshow/123667981.cms,"AI image





Digital content creators, including streamers and influencers, will be able to claim tax deductions on the tips they earn starting next year. The move comes under Donald Trump’s “no tax on tips” policy, a key campaign promise passed by Congress in July.According to a draft list of eligible jobs, reported by Axios, the policy covers workers who earn tips “customarily and regularly.” This includes online video creators, podcasters, social media influencers, and streamers. It also applies to food service staff, musicians, dancers, and hospitality workers.The law allows workers to deduct up to $25,000 of tip income, with the benefit phasing out for individuals earning more than $150,000 or couples earning above $300,000 annually. Top-earning creators on platforms like Twitch and TikTok will not qualify, but mid-level influencers and small streamers are expected to benefit.On digital platforms, tips are often called by different names—Twitch “bits,” TikTok “gifts,” YouTube “Super Chats,” and OnlyFans “tip menus.” For creators who rely on this income, the deduction could ease tax pressure.The policy takes effect immediately, meaning qualifying workers can claim deductions for tips received in 2024 when they file their returns early next year. However, the scheme is temporary and set to expire after 2028 unless extended by Congress.The Republican senate of the US unanimously passed the “no tax on tips” bill in May. Surprisingly, the “no tax on tips” provision received unanimous bipartisan acceptance.","Digital content creators, including streamers and influencers, will be able to claim tax deductions on the tips they earn starting next year.

If the required input is not produced in Bahrain.

If it is unavailable in the required standards locally.

If it cannot be manufactured within the necessary timeframe.

Or, under the “10 per cent rule”, if the cost of producing the input locally exceeds the cost of importing it by more than 10 per cent.

Strategic move aligned with national economic vision

Economic impacts and supporting industrial programs



Encourage expansion of local factories

Support the creation of new jobs

Sustain and grow the export footprint of Bahrain-made products

‘Made in Bahrain’ trademark – granted to products with at least 35% local content, promoting national branding and local pride.

‘Green Factory Seal’ – awarded to manufacturers adopting sustainable and environmentally responsible practices.

‘iFactories’ programme – aimed at encouraging digital transformation and smart manufacturing technologies in local industries.





A new customs exemption policy allows Bahraini factories to import key industrial inputs duty-free under specific conditions, marking a strategic shift to boost manufacturing, lower costs, and enhance local competitiveness.Bahrain has issued Decision No. (63) of 2025, a regulatory move that allows factories to import certain raw materials and production inputs without paying customs duties, provided specific conditions are met.

Nepal has ordered a ban on 26 social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram and X, after they failed to register with the government within a seven-day deadline.The decision comes in line with a Supreme Court directive and a ministerial meeting held on Thursday that included Communications and Information Technology Minister Prithvi Subba Gurung, ministry officials, the Nepal Telecommunication Authority, telecom operators and internet service providers.According to officials, restrictions will apply nationwide with immediate effect, and the ministry has begun issuing letters to the concerned companies. The government had earlier warned that non-compliant platforms would face suspension.While Viber, TikTok, Wetalk and Nimbuzz are registered, and Telegram and Global Diary are in the process, major platforms such as Facebook, Twitter (X), WhatsApp, Reddit, LinkedIn and YouTube have yet to initiate registration. Officials said services may resume once platforms complete the registration process and comply with national rules.“The Honourable Supreme Court, in a contempt of court case (Case No. 080-8-0012), has issued a directive order in the name of the Government of Nepal to mandatorily list domestic or foreign-origin online and social media platforms with the relevant authorities before operation and to evaluate and monitor unwanted content.In accordance with the decision of the Government of Nepal (Council of Ministers) dated 2082.05.09, for the implementation of the said order, the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology has published a public notice on 2082.05.12, giving a deadline of seven (7) days to list social media platforms as per the 'Directive on Regulating the Use of Social Media, 2080'. All stakeholders are hereby informed that the Nepal Telecommunication Authority has been directed to deactivate social media platforms within Nepal that have not contacted the Ministry for listing within the specified time limit and to reactivate them from the same moment if they are listed,” a notice issued by the ministry reads.The ministry added that all other major social media and communication platforms, including Messenger, Snapchat, Discord, Pinterest, Signal, Threads, WeChat, Quora, Tumblr, Clubhouse, Rumble, Mi Video, Mi Vike, Line, Imo, Jalo, Sol and Hamro Patro, will also be blocked until they complete registration.The Supreme Court issued its mandamus order on Wednesday, nearly five years after writ petitions were filed seeking restrictions on advertisements and content broadcast via unlicensed social media platforms, OTT apps and internet browsers. A joint bench of Justices Tek Prasad Dhungana and Shanti Singh Thapa heard three petitions together and ruled in favour of the petitioners.In December 2020, advocates B.P. Gautam and Anita Bajgain had filed writs demanding a ban on unrestricted broadcasts, including foreign advertisements, through social media. Manoj Gurung, General Secretary of the Nepal Cable Television Federation, filed a similar petition. The court consolidated the cases before issuing the mandamus, directing that unlicensed platforms must stop broadcasting advertisements and content without legal approval.Government spokesperson and Minister for Communications and Information Technology Prithvi Subba Gurung told the National Assembly on August 19 that Meta, the parent company of Facebook, was repeatedly urged to register in Nepal but responded that it was not ready to comply with Nepal’s laws and constitution.According to the ministry’s notice, operational platforms must register with the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology, designate contact points in Nepal, appoint officials to handle local complaints and assign compliance monitoring officers.","The decision comes in line with a supreme court directive and a ministerial meeting held on thursday.
