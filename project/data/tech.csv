The Kick deal that changed everything

Why she is returning to Twitch now



No YouTube comeback expected

A top name in online entertainment



Kaitlyn Siragusa , better known as Amouranth, a viral internet personality and streamer who has made her highly anticipated return to Twitch on June 20, 2025. Over the past two years, she earned a staggering $38 million on rival streaming platform Kick , becoming one of the most financially successful figures in online entertainment. Known for her bold mix of gaming, cosplay , ASMR, and real-life streams, Amouranth originally built her empire on Twitch before facing multiple bans and moving to other platforms. Her return signals both a personal comeback and a potential shift in the ongoing competition between streaming giants.Her return to Twitch not only marks a personal comeback but also highlights the evolving dynamics of the streaming industry. With platforms like Kick scaling back exclusivity deals and encouraging multistreaming, Amouranth’s move could signal a new era where top creators leverage multiple platforms on their own terms. While her relationship with YouTube remains strained, Twitch’s massive audience and cultural influence make it the ideal stage for her to continue growing her brand.Amouranth began her career as a cosplayer and model before joining Twitch in 2016, where she quickly gained massive popularity. Her streams combined gaming, audience interaction, and ASMR, attracting millions of viewers. She became especially known for her “hot tub” streams, a controversial Twitch subgenre that sparked widespread discussion. Despite facing repeated bans for pushing Twitch’s content boundaries, Amouranth remained a fan favorite and expanded her influence through various business ventures, including OnlyFans and merchandise. Her ability to adapt and innovate helped her become one of Twitch’s most successful and recognizable creators.In 2023, following xQc’s headline-making $100 million deal with Kick, Amouranth joined the platform backed by crypto gambling site Stake. Though the details of her contract were not publicly disclosed, she confirmed that her income more than doubled compared to Twitch. Over two years, she reportedly made $38 million through Kick deals, merchandise sales, and content subscriptions.On June 19, 2025, Amouranth shared a playful teaser video on X (formerly Twitter) hinting at her comeback. In the video, she is seen refueling a green car with a Kick license plate before driving off in a purple vehicle — Twitch’s signature color. A cartoon screen flashes “$38 million later.” While it is not yet confirmed if she will stream exclusively on Twitch, her return has already stirred excitement among fans.Amouranth’s YouTube presence has declined sharply. Her main channel was banned for ban evasion, and her ASMR channel was removed for guideline violations. Given this history, she is not expected to include YouTube in her future content plans.Even during her Kick run, Amouranth remained a widely recognized figure. She launched products, signed brand deals, and continued to grow her online presence. Her return to Twitch highlights her ongoing relevance and reflects the increasing competition among platforms to attract big names. As one of the most followed streamers in the world, Amouranth is poised to remain a dominant force in digital entertainment.","Kaitlyn siragusa, better known as amouranth, will return to twitch on june 20, 2025.

Google never silenced Geoffrey Hinton, but self-censorship kicked in

5 biggest AI announcements at Microsoft Build 2025

""We would never accept this mindset in any other field""

Geoffrey Hinton , who's known as the "" Godfather of AI ,"" has revealed the internal pressures that influenced his decision to leave Google after more than a decade, citing self-censorship concerns that prevented him from speaking freely about artificial intelligence dangers .Speaking on the ""Diary of a CEO"" podcast that aired June 16, Hinton explained how corporate loyalty created an unspoken barrier to discussing AI risks. ""If you work for a big company, you don't feel right saying things that will damage the big company,"" he said, describing the psychological constraint he faced while employed at Google.The neural network pioneer, who quit Google in 2023, emphasized that the tech giant never directly pressured him to remain silent about AI safety issues. ""Google encouraged me to stay and work on AI safety, and said I could do whatever I liked on AI safety,"" Hinton noted. However, he admitted that employees naturally ""censor yourself"" when working for major corporations.Hinton's departure came as he grew increasingly concerned about AI's potential dangers, including the spread of misinformation, job displacement, and what he termed ""existential risk"" from digital intelligence surpassing human capabilities. His concerns intensified after Microsoft integrated ChatGPT into its search engine, prompting Google to accelerate its own AI chatbot development.The 75-year-old researcher's warnings align with broader industry concerns about AI safety protocols. Hinton highlighted the particular challenge of AI-generated content, noting that people ""will not be able to discern what is true any more"" as realistic fake photos, videos, and text flood the internet.His departure underscores a growing tension in the tech industry between rapid AI advancement and safety considerations. While praising Google's overall responsible behavior, Hinton's exit reflects the complex dynamics facing AI researchers who must balance corporate interests with public safety concerns in an increasingly competitive landscape.","Geoffrey hinton, known as the "" godfather of ai,"" left google in 2023.

With the ongoing wave of layoffs, fear of AI-driven job losses ripple through the professionals around the globe, however, LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky is suggesting a more balanced perspective. He emphasises that AI will undoubtedly bring ‘a ton of disruption’ , but it will also reshape the nature of work and will create more opportunities. In an interview with Bloomberg, Roslansky linked the present technological shift to Industrial Revolution. He stressed on the fact that despite initial problems, AI will ultimately create more industries and multiple new job opportunities .Ryan Roslansky emphasised that the rise of AI doesn’t mean the end of work—it means the evolution of work. “We’re seeing a shift in the skills employers are looking for,” he noted, pointing to LinkedIn data highlighting increase in demand for AI literacy, human-AI collaboration skills and prompt engineering.""There's going to be, over time, more and more options to build careers without having to go work for a big company,"" Ryan Roslansky suggested. He also said that the skills needed for the same jobs are also evolving. For instance in India, the job skills required for the same job have changed by 40% since 2015 and he expects this figure to rise to 70% by 2030.Ryan Roslansky's views align with those of LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman , who has also publicly stated that people are underestimating the impact of AI on jobs but rejects the notion of a ""bloodbath."" Reid Hoffman, co-founder of LinkedIn, has direct advice for those who claim artificial intelligence (AI) isn't useful and yet to find practical applications for the technology, suggesting that a lack of perceived utility stems from insufficient effort. He also shared examples of how he uses the tool effectively in his daily life.“Frankly, if you haven’t found something where it's useful to you, about something you care about, then you're not trying hard enough, you're not being original enough,” Reid Hoffman stated during an interview on The Economist podcast, broadcast this week (via Business Insider).Both LinkedIn executives emphasise on the fact that it is important for workers to shift their focus from static jobs and master their tasks by learning new skills.","Linkedin ceo ryan roslansky says ai will reshape the nature of work.

A Thread post shared the incident of 3 H-1B visa holders denied entry to the US.





A viral social media post claimed that three Indian nationals reportedly were denied entry to the US after they flouted the rules and stayed in India for over 60 days. A message posted on the Threads narrating the situation of these three H-1B visa holders is doing the rounds, after they were stopped at Abu Dhabi immigration and their visas were revoked. The post has triggered a debate among the H-1B community as many doubted that this was fake and their entry must have been restricted for some other reason.According to the viral post, all three of them had proof of emergency and approval emails from the company and attorney, but still, they were sent back. One stayed for two months and 27 days, while the other two stayed in India for over three months.""Very sorry to hear this. Just now, three H1B holders messaged me from Abu Dhabi Airport. They were denied entry and had their H1B visas cancelled for staying in India beyond 60 days — one stayed 2 months 27 days, the others over 3 months. They’re now waiting for flights back — one to Bangalore, two to Hyderabad. Even with employer letters and emergency proof, CBP still revoked their visas under 22 CFR 41.122(h)(3),"" the message read.""There is no need to be india for 3months if you are working in USA,"" one user wrote.The same post on Reddit was taken down. One Redditor claimed that there is no such rule as long as the visa and the employment remain valid. ""Something doesn’t seem right here. As an Indian passport holder on an H1B visa — which is a non-immigrant, temporary worker visa — you are allowed to stay outside the U.S. for an extended period, as long as your visa and employment remain valid,"" the user wrote.""There is no specific law that restricts H1B holders from being outside the US for more than 60 days. It appears the immigration officers may not have followed proper guidelines in this case, and the decision to deport these individuals seems questionable,"" the user added.","A viral post claimed 3 h-1b visa holders were denied entry to the us as they spent over 60 days in india.

Township mechanics in South Africa unite to turbocharge their small businesses,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/township-mechanics-in-south-africa-unite-to-turbocharge-their-small-businesses/articleshow/122038730.cms,"Township mechanics in South Africa unite to turbocharge their small businesses (Image: AP)





BRAKPAN: Themba Maseko quickly wipes oil and grease off his hands with a rag as he breaks away from repairing one car to assist another customer who needs parts for a low-riding BMW 325 is that he's pulled up in, exhausts booming.As soon as Maseko returns beneath the hood of the first vehicle to continue his work, yet another man arrives desperately wanting his car to be looked at.""It gets hectic,"" said the 39-year-old mechanic, sweat plastering his face.The father of three runs a small motor repair shop in the township of Tsakane, about 50 kilometres (31 miles) east of South Africa's biggest city of Johannesburg. His hopes for his business to succeed when it's up against established urban car service and repair centres have been boosted by a new initiative started at the end of last year.Maseko has joined with other mechanics from townships to form a cooperative. Together, they now have combined purchasing power to ensure they can source official car spares and equipment for their shops and don't get cut out of the market. The Motor Spares Collective means they can place orders to an online spares shop through WhatsApp and authentic parts are usually delivered to them in 24 hours.That avoids what Maseko says is his biggest challenge: spending hours away from his garage queuing for parts, sometimes to find there aren't any in stock because they've been bought up by larger chains.As one busy day at his shop showed, the customers are lining up for Maseko's services, he just needs the parts.""Now with the collective it's much easier. I don't have to go stand in queue and waste time,"" said Maseko, who changed career from an electrician to a full-time mechanic in 2008. ""Plus, it's at a cheaper price.""Small enterprises are part of a big informal sector The Motor Spares Collective is one initiative designed to unlock the potential of small township businesses in South Africa, which the government has identified as key to driving growth and creating jobs in areas where unemployment and poverty are high.Various studies indicate that more than 21 million people in South Africa live in townships on the edge of major cities or towns - a third of the population - and they have a combined spending power of billions of dollars and generally prefer local businesses.South Africa has over 700,000 registered small businesses. In the townships these include hair salons, taverns, car repair shops, laundromats and others sometimes operating out of people's homes. According to a report by financial services group Lesaka, South Africa's informal sector generates an estimated $33 billion in revenue, or more than 6 percent of GDP.""People don't respect the trade in the townships,"" said Sharief Bartus, another member of the motor spares collective.For a $10 monthly membership fee for the first year, Maseko and the others get more than just access to car parts and tools for their garages. The collective also offers skills development opportunities, help with business registration and financing.""The more members we get, the more discounts we get, the more work we have,"" said Dorian Slimmerts, another mechanic in the collective who is operating not far from Maseko.Mechanics discover a thriving opportunity Township mechanics offering a local option for car owners have long battled on the fringes of the country's commercial auto manufacturing and repair sector. A regulation change in 2020 also made a big difference. New ""right to repair"" rules in South Africa mean car owners can now have their vehicles serviced by registered independent mechanics and not lose their warranties.That's opened the door a little more for township mechanics.Car maintenance is especially needed in South Africa, where there are around 12 million automobiles on the road and people are keeping their cars longer. The demand for affordable pre-owned cars has outpaced new cars since the COVID-19 pandemic.Time is the critical element for township mechanics, though. Their businesses see lots of walk-in clients, prices are often negotiated and customers expect quick service - or they will look elsewhere.""All the mechanic sells is time,"" said Amanda Gcabashe, managing director of UBU Investment Holdings, an economic advisory company that helped set up the cooperative. ""And that's why we came with this to say, how do we make sure that we then solve that pain point by making spares easily accessible?""She said that as well as the business help, the collective is also looking to offer life insurance packages and other social safety net services for its mechanics.Bulelani Balabala, the founder of the Township Entrepreneurs Alliance, said cooperatives were a powerful way to harness the potential of small businesses serving millions of people in townships.""It's a market that can't be ignored,"" he said.","Township mechanics in south africa unite to turbocharge their small businesses.

No longer chasing the brick-and-mortar stores business in India: Walmart,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/no-longer-chasing-the-brick-and-mortar-stores-business-in-india-walmart/articleshow/122055993.cms,"Is there a rush to stock up before the reciprocal tariffs make a comeback? How are tariffs affecting you and American buyers?

Have tariffs changed the sourcing dynamics? Have you increased your purchases from US suppliers?

Has 'China+1' resulted in more sourcing from India?

Flipkart has been late to enter quick commerce. How will its growth trajectory look like?

Does it mean more cash burn?

How do you view the policy landscape here as there are questions on whether Amazon and Flipkart are compliant with rules in letter and spirit or not?

Is allowing an inventory based model for Flipkart something that Walmart would seek?

Would you be interested in brick & mortar stores in India if FDI rules permit?

Is that also because of the changing nature of consumers? Given that Amazon is overtaking in terms of revenue, how are you addressing that?

Is it a level-playing field given the rules allow an inventory based model for Indian companies?

Walmart president and CEO Doug McMillon doesn't mince words. In an interview, McMillon (59), who oversaw the US retail giant's acquisition of a controlling stake in Flipkart in 2018 in a $16-billion deal, tells TOI that the company seeks a level-playing field in the countries it operates, that would mean opening up the inventory based model to foreign e-commerce players in India like Walmart and Amazon, which local rules prohibit. He also says that Walmart is no longer chasing the brick-and-mortar stores business in India. Excerpts from the interaction with McMillon and Walmart International president & CEO Kathryn McLay:Doug McMillon: We are doing everything we can to keep our prices as low as possible for as long as possible. Sourcing out of India is important to us. We have a long-term view. We will balance the various pressures.McMillon: There are many benefits to buying close to where your demand is... you can create more jobs, have less lead time. More than two-thirds of what we sell in the US is made, grown or assembled in the US. Whether it's in the US or Mexico or other countries, we try to first and foremost to buy in that country...Kathryn McLay: We learned during Covid that if you had over-reliance on any particular trade route, then it could be very disruptive. So, for the last five years, we have been looking at building a resilient supply chain. Sourcing from India is a great option for us and it's a great option for India.McMillon: It has been good to see the breadth of categories expand. When we started here, we were buying a lot of soft goods. And now, we are buying food items, more general merchandise categories other than just in-home. What we see in India is that we can buy all kinds of things. We hope that the diversification of the manufacturing base in India continues.McLay: When the Flipkart team decided to move to quick commerce, they moved with speed. Not only have they got really strong plans around roll out, but they continue to blow our minds in regards to the speed - to do a delivery in minutes.McLay: We have always said that we are interested in making sure that we are positioned around growth and market share, and delighting the customers before we are focus on profits. Obviously, we need to make profits but we kind of think about it in that order. Flipkart's in this wonderful position of having access to 500 million customers.McMillon: Our job one is to be compliant. That's our focus. Job two is to communicate to everybody what we see that would help us to be able to serve customers better and what we think rules could look like that would help support the economy. We communicate with this govt and other govts all the time with regards to that.McMillon: We like managing inventory, managing inventory is difficult but it's one of the areas where we have expertise. Hopefully, at some point, that will happen.McMillon: That's not something we are pursuing. We have learnt that that's very difficult. We are very excited to have invested in Flipkart.McMillon: Around the world, e-commerce has been growing and continues to grow. But particularly in India, the e-commerce business has a really bright future; Flipkart has a really bright future and I am really thankful that we made the investment when we did.McMillon: The rules aren't up to us.

This en'hancement is likely to benefit lakhs of subscribers, especially during urgent needs such as illness, education, marriage or housing. Auto-settlement allows claims to be processed entirely by an automated system without human intervention, ensuring quick disbursal & greater transparency.First introduced during the Covid-19 pandemic to provide financial relief, the advance claims EPFO facility has since been expanded and now covers a broad range of advance claims.Announcing the decision, Union labour and employment minister Mansukh Mandaviya said, ""The enhancement of the auto-settlement limit is a testament to our govt's commitment to ensuring dignity and ease of living for India's workforce. EPFO members should be able to access their funds promptly, especially in times of need. This step will bring efficiency, speed and trust to the system.""The move is part of a broader series of reforms by EPFO to modernise and simplify operations.Key initiatives include simplification of KYC correction processes, removal of employer dependency for profile updates and activation of UAN using face authentication technology through the Umang app.EPFO has also eliminated the need for uploading cheque leaf images or passbook copies and removed employer approval requirements for seeding bank account details and transferring claims. In addition, a Centralised Pension Payment System has been launched to streamline pension disbursement.The impact of these reforms is visible in recent figures. In FY 2024-25, EPFO processed a record 2.34 crore advance claims via the auto mode - a 161% increase from 89.52 lakh in FY 2023-24. Auto-settlement accounted for 59% of all such claims last year, up from 31% the previous year. In the first two and a half months of FY 2025-26, EPFO has already auto-settled 76.52 lakh claims, representing 70% of all advance claims so far.Officials said the growth reflected EPFO's commitment to automation and member-centric services. With the increased auto-settlement limit now in place, members will have faster and more reliable access to their funds, further reducing grievances and enhancing trust in the system.","Epfo has raised the auto-settlement limit for advance claims from rs 1 lakh to rs 5 lakh.
