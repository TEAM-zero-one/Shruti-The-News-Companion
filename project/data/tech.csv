'All of them are some distance away': CDS Anil Chauhan's take on China's sixth-generation fighter aircrafts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/all-of-them-are-some-distance-away-cds-anil-chauhans-take-on-chinas-sixth-generation-fighter-aircrafts/articleshow/118179831.cms,"China's NEW 6th Gen Fighter Took its First Successful Flight

The Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan on Wednesday raised doubts over China's claims about their sixth-generation fighter aircraft, stating that these aircraft are still under development.CDS Chauhan, when questioned about Chinese sixth-generation fighter jet claims, told news agency ANI that while numerous nations are working on sixth-generation programmes, he personally believes all are considerably far from completion. He suggested that nations might be displaying these technologies as part of their tactical approach.""It's very difficult to see these kinds of platforms with six-generation capability. What we are talking about is by external viewing of an aircraft and that too with a few seconds clip which will not give you an idea that this is six generation aircraft. In fact, a large number of countries are pursuing a six-generation program and that's my personal belief that all of them are some distance away. But sometime back we had heard about the capabilities of WS 10 or WS 15 engines which are there on 5th generation aircraft for the Chinese,"" General Chauhan said.""Sometime back, we had also heard about Chinese hiring a number of ex-pilots of the American and the British Air Force. They wanted to refine their drills and their systems, so they just show that they're still in that kind of a development stage. Not only as far as technology is concerned, but also tactics is concerned. So we are there. We have a program for AMCA that's a 5th generation fighter, so that's somewhere down the line. But we are there,"" he added.Additionally, General Chauhan explained his perspective on sixth-generation aircraft, describing it as a platform capable of both manned and unmanned operations .""My understanding of a sixth generation aircraft is that there is no proper globally accepted definition of what a sixth generation aircraft is. Basically, a sixth generation aircraft is a platform which can perform both manned and unmanned teaming. It is kind of an aerial command post which can take control of 2-3 similar kinds of assets, maybe UAVs, maybe drones which are sound drones and then put a combat in a different kind of a manner,"" he said.CDS Chauhan said that such aircraft would incorporate various technologies, including networks, data analytics and artificial intelligence to enhance the pilot's decision-making capabilities during combat situations.""So that's the kind of concept of six-generation and it involves number of technologies. It will involve networks, data analytics which will provide that kind of situation awareness to that pilot over there and also command and control of all the assets. He should be able to network himself or spar passage of information through terrestrial or say aerial networks. It will also use artificial intelligence to give him that better decision making ability during combat. It also will have maybe long range smart air-to-air missiles, weapon systems and apart from that stealth technology with self-healing kind of capabilities,"" he concluded.","Chief of defence staff (cds) general anil chauhan raised doubts over china's claims about their sixth-generation fighter aircraft.

Who is Samay Raina?

Who is Beer Biceps?

Akaash Singh, the Indian-American stand-up comedian known for his sharp wit and unapologetic humor, has come out strongly in support of fellow comedians Beer Biceps (Ranveer Allahbadia) and Samay Raina.Amid growing online controversy, Singh took to social media to clarify his stance, stating unequivocally that he endorses the jokes of these comedians and all stand-up comics in India.The comedian, who gained widespread recognition for his stand-up special Gaslit and his interview with former US President Donald Trump on Flagrant, did not hold back in defending his peers. Singh’s statement came after several online users criticized Allahbadia and Raina, accusing them of vulgarity and inappropriate humor. In response to a challenge by a user who questioned whether he would openly endorse such humor, Singh tweeted: “Was this not clear? I endorse the jokes of @ReheSamay, @BeerBicepsGuy, and EVERY comedian in India. And to my Indian fans who ask why I only do pop-up shows there, this story is why. I gotta weed out morons like the ones offended by this COMPLETELY harmless joke.”His comments highlight the ongoing tension between artistic freedom in comedy and the growing scrutiny from audiences who feel certain content crosses a moral or cultural line. In India, where stand-up comedy has grown rapidly in the last decade, comedians frequently find themselves at the center of controversy over their material. Many have faced legal challenges, social media outrage, and calls for censorship. Singh’s statement signals his belief that comedians should not be policed for their humor.The debate intensified when another Twitter user suggested that vulgarity should be heavily fined in stand-up and OTT content, proposing penalties of Rs. 5 crore per offensive word. Singh responded with an expletive-laden rebuttal:“Suck my d**** you dumbass m*********.”The blunt response from the comedian, known for his no-filter approach, further fueled the conversation about where the line should be drawn in comedy. Supporters of Singh applauded his defense of free speech, while critics argued that he was endorsing unnecessary crudeness in the art form.Another user accused Singh of supporting “filthy” comedians like Ranveer Allahbadia, to which he simply replied, “Nah.” The straightforward dismissal reflected Singh’s unwillingness to engage in moral policing and his commitment to standing by his peers.Adding to the discussion, Singh also defended Allahbadia directly, tweeting: “@BeerBicepsGuy is family. I don’t know what people are coming after him for and I don’t give a f***. I’m riding with him.”With his influence in both American and Indian comedy circles, Singh’s vocal stance reinforces a larger global conversation about the role of comedy in challenging societal norms. Whether or not his words will shift opinions remains to be seen, but one thing is certain—Akaash Singh isn’t backing down.Samay Raina is a well-known stand-up comedian and chess streamer in India. He rose to fame after winning Comicstaan, a popular Indian stand-up comedy competition, and later carved a niche for himself by merging comedy with chess streaming on platforms like YouTube. Raina, like many other comedians, frequently uses satire and observational humor in his performances.However, Indian comedians often find themselves in controversy due to cultural sensitivities and the country’s strict laws on speech. Even jokes that would be considered mild in American comedy can sometimes spark outrage, leading to social media backlash, police complaints, and even legal trouble. While Raina has not faced serious legal consequences, he has been criticized for his jokes, particularly by more conservative audiences who argue that comedy should remain “clean.”Ranveer Allahbadia, known as Beer Biceps, is a social media influencer, YouTuber, and entrepreneur. He initially gained popularity through fitness content before transitioning into self-improvement, business advice, and long-form podcasting. His podcast, The Ranveer Show, has hosted numerous high-profile guests, from Bollywood celebrities to spiritual leaders, and has positioned itself as a mix of motivational content and deep conversations.Recently, Allahbadia has faced criticism for some of his interviews and comments. While the specifics of the controversy are somewhat scattered, it generally revolves around accusations that he spreads misinformation or engages in sensationalist content for engagement. Some online users also disapprove of the guests he invites, including figures from polarizing political or spiritual backgrounds.","Akaash singh, the indian-american stand-up comedian, has come out strongly in support of fellow comedians beer biceps (ranveer allahbadia) and samay raina.

Steelers Have No Plans of Losing Trevor Lawrence, As Per Reports

The conclusion of the Super Bowl also marks the beginning of staffing changes for the NFL’s coaching teams. However, there are plenty of rumours swirling about which may not be true and could be pure speculation or even fan theories. As per sports journalist Ryan Burr who works for the Big 10 Network, Pittsburgh Steelers have made enquiries about Jaguars quarterback Trevor Lawrence . However, a senior Steelers source has denied this rumour.Burr had tweeted on X, “Steelers have made inquiries to the [Jaguars] about a trade for QB Trevor Lawerence. This directly from the horses mouth in the Jags organization. WOW!” But a more recent news report has said that this is not true. A senior Steelers source has reportedly told the press, “There has never been nor was there at any time, implied or directly, any imposition about Trevor Lawrence.""I am certain that any official with the Jacksonville Jaguars would confirm this,"" the source added. ""Simply not true.""Moreover, a Jaguars source has also revealed that these rumours are ""laughable."" This news did seem unlikely since Lawrence is likely to stick with Jacksonville this season.

However, they were eliminated by the Kansas City Chiefs.Steelers on the other hand are reportedly looking to retain Justin Fields but have had conversations about Aaron Rodgers , who will be released by the New York Jets. The team can also consider Russell Wilson who will be a free agent soon.","Trevor lawrence has no plans of switching teams, according to a senior steelers source.

The ban, initially set to take effect on January 19, 2025, was postponed by 75 days through an executive order signed by Trump, allowing the app to continue its operations temporarily.The decision to delay the ban came after concerns were raised about the app's Chinese ownership and potential national security risks. The law, passed by Congress and signed by former President Joe Biden, required TikTok's parent company, ByteDance , to sell its US operations or face a nationwide ban. However, Trump's executive order has provided a temporary reprieve, giving his administration time to determine the appropriate course of action.TikTok, which boasts 170 million American users, had gone dark in the US for several weeks before the app was restored on the app stores. The delay in the ban has allowed Apple and Google to reinstate TikTok without facing penalties for distributing or maintaining the app.The move has sparked discussions about the future of TikTok in the US and the broader implications of regulating foreign-owned apps.

MUMBAI: Temasek and KKR-backed Rebel Foods is foraying into the quick food delivery space, stepping up competition in a market where players like Zomato, Swiggy and Zepto are spending heavily to get ahead of the game. The Mumbai-based company is betting on the fact that consumers who are often driven by convenience will increasingly switch to 10-15 minute food delivery if they are catered well. For Rebel Foods, which already runs multiple cloud kitchen brands such as Behrouz Biryani, Faasos Wraps and has infrastructure in place, the launch of the 15-minute food delivery service branded as QuickiES comes without incurring significant costs.""When consumers get hunger pangs, they crave for food then and there itself.

But for the 15-min service, all customer orders will be fulfilled only through EatSure.

NEW DELHI: Faced with sluggish sales during the festive period, consumer-centric companies , high street fashion, luxury and jewellery brands are witnessing a surge in sales as they approach Valentine's Day (V-Day). Consumers are splurging on a variety of items, with an uptick in demand for jewellery, apparel, premium chocolates, and curated experiences like short weekend getaways.For some retailers, sales are on par with the festive buying season, significantly boosting the commercial appeal of the occasion. Not to be left behind, quick commerce platforms including Zomato are capitalising on the spike in demand for flowers, cakes and desserts, while restaurants are preparing to handle the expected surge in footfalls.Last year, on V-Day, sales of popular categories like cake and desserts on Zomato increased three-to-four times compared to a regular day and gift hampers saw a twelve-fold increase.

UK Home Buying Selling Reforms: UK to digitise property sales for faster transactions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/fit-for-21st-century-uk-to-digitise-property-sales-for-faster-transactions/articleshow/118106621.cms,"Long homebuying process in UK

The UK government is planning to digitise property sales data to speed up home purchases and reduce delays, The Guardian reports.A 12-week initiative has been launched to create standardised rules for data sharing among conveyancers, lenders, and others involved in transactions.Currently, much of the process relies on paper documents or outdated systems, causing delays. The changes aim to improve information sharing and make the process more efficient.""We are streamlining the cumbersome homebuying process so that it is fit for the 21st century, helping homebuyers save money, gain time, and reduce stress while also cutting the number of house sales that fall through,"" housing and planning minister Matthew Pennycook was quoted as saying, according to The Guardian.The initiative is part of a wider housing reform plan, including changes to planning rules, building 1.5 million homes, and leasehold reforms.Buying a home in the UK typically takes months, with delays caused by conveyancing, property searches, and document retrieval.According to Rightmove, the UK's largest online real estate portal, it takes an average of five months from offer acceptance to moving in.Rightmove CEO Johan Svanstrom explained that this follows an initial two-month period for property selection and offer agreement. He added: ""The current process also contributes to an average of more than one in five home sales falling through, and hopefully a better process can help reduce this as well.""The ministry of housing, communities and local government says full digitalisation will allow instant access to information for mortgage providers and surveyors, with single identity verification.Right now, important documents like building control and highways records are mostly on paper. Delays also happen because there are no standardised protocols for accessing and verifying electronic data.To improve this, the ministry is working with HM Land Registry (HMLR) and experts from the Digital Property Market Steering Group.HMLR will lead 10-month pilot projects with councils to test digital data sharing. Plans also include digital identity verification to speed up transactions.New leasehold legislation taking effect on March 3 will give leaseholders more control over service charge costs and remove their obligation to pay freeholder legal fees for right-to-manage claims.These changes could save leaseholders up to £3,000 on legal costs and reduce landlord obstruction tactics.Pennycook said the reforms will help leaseholders ""more easily and cheaply take control of the buildings they live in and clamp down on unreasonable or extortionate charges.""","The uk government is planning to digitise property sales data to speed up home purchases.

Takeaways: Tesla has sued Chinese customers and journalists and won almost every time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/takeaways-tesla-has-sued-chinese-customers-and-journalists-and-won-almost-every-time/articleshow/118180992.cms,"In this photo, Zhang Yazhou sits on the roof of her damaged Tesla Model 3 with a bullhorn outside a Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou (Image credits: AP)

Tesla did not return requests for comment. Here are some key things to know about Tesla's success in China:

Media coverage of Tesla in China is constrained

BEIJING: Tesla has embraced an aggressive legal strategy in China to stifle its critics suing its own customers.That's left some Tesla owners desperate. Zhang Yazhou protested publicly that her Model 3's brakes had failed and caused an accident in 2021 that sent her parents to the hospital. Tesla said that wasn't true and sued her for defamation. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay the $1.1-trillion company more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize for her criticism.""I refuse to accept it,"" said Zhang, who appealed the verdict. ""As a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.""As concerns mount about eroding checks and balances in the US, Tesla's record in China shows how it has thrived in a system where regulators, the courts and media all answer to the ruling Communist Party.It's not common for automakers in China or elsewhere to sue their own customers. But Tesla has done so successfully in China, where Elon Musk 's company has used the courts and the patronage of a powerful leader to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.Musk has a powerful patron in China Tesla's commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China's premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping . Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China's financial capital under his watch in 2019.With Li's support, Tesla was the first foreign automaker allowed to retain complete control over its China venture. Tesla got low-interest loans, tax breaks, favorable regulatory changes and other benefits.In January 2020, Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. That year, Tesla turned an annual profit for the first time in its history and Musk was soon declared the world's richest person.Musk's ""greater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,"" said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd, an advisory firm based in Shanghai. ""He's done a good job of it in China, and he's done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.""Requests for comment to the state council, which is run by Li Qiang, went unanswered.Tesla has had an impressive winning streak in Chinese courts Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures.The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review of public court documents and Chinese media reports by The Associated Press.Tesla won all eleven cases for which AP could determine the verdicts. Two judgments are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it has also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgments in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.While some industry experts say it's generally difficult for customers to win such cases, others say it's remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.""For Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,"" said Russo, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. ""The odds are stacked against you. It's like going to the casino and winning every hand.""In a statement to AP, the Shanghai high people's court said that judgements are the result of a ""fair trial.""""It cannot be assumed that the party has received 'special protection' or 'special treatment' because of their victory,"" the court wrote.Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.""We were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,"" a tech reporter told AP.Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk's company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. PingWest had to apologize for a report that claimed Tesla's Shanghai factory was a ""sweatshop"" and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). The AP could not determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com, which drew Tesla's ire after writing about the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla.Electric vehicle giant BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors in going after car owners who suffered crashes.""Tesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,"" said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,000) after he wrote about Tesla's alleged brake failures. ""Tesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.""","Tesla's success in china has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: li qiang, the former party boss of shanghai who is now china's premier.

AR glasses ignite new prospects for Indian developers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/times-techies/ar-glasses-ignite-new-prospects-for-indian-developers/articleshow/118231518.cms,"AR spectacle could change the game

Endless possibilities with AI

Imagine having a computer seamlessly overlaid on your glasses. Surprisingly, this technology is advancing rapidly and discreetly. Not only that, you can also start building apps for this burgeoning next-gen ecosystem right now. Snap, the parent company of instant messaging app, Snapchat, held their AR Day at a Mumbai film studio on Wednesday, where they showcased their augmented reality spectacles and the apps that run on them.What quickly became apparent during the demos was that we are inching closer to an era where interacting with digital objects in our immediate environment is as simple as reaching out, pinching a virtual element, and dragging it in mid-air. Wearing these spectacles, everything feels tantalisingly close to the promise of a seamless blend between our physical reality and the digital world. The bigger revelation, however, might be that creating these experiences is not the sole domain of well-heeled tech companies, but an emerging prospect for hungry developers in India with a penchant for inventiveness.At the event, a number of developers and Snap representatives gathered to demonstrate how AR experiences can be built using their free tool, Lens Studio. According to Snap’s head of AR partnerships for India, Srivatsan Jayasankar, these spectacles represent a major step forward for AR hardware. Though still in developer mode (only available for developers and not for consumers), they are foldable, lightweight, and, crucially, untethered. They don’t require a wired connection to a bulky processing unit or a phone, though they can wirelessly sync with one. The waveguide technology in the lens frame projects digital elements into the real world before your eyes, which, as Jayasankar points out, “lets you interact with computing without confining yourself to a four-sided screen.” The movement and gesture tracking is smooth and intuitive; it all seems to mimic the same motions you would use in daily life.Many Indian developers are already working on innovative projects with these devices. One such developer is 25-year-old freelancer and XR creator, Jeetesh Singh. His action-based AR game called Signs of Doom, which everyone got to play during the demos, lets players move about in the real world and use their hands as controllers. “The player forms a triangle-like hand pose to fire bolts at on-screen enemies that appear in the physical environment. Your hands are free, so you can use both hands without needing any controllers,” he says. “There are so many possible gestures that can make AR gaming feel natural. Once you have that core interaction, it’s less about controlling a game and more about embodying it.”One challenge he faced while building his first large-scale AR game was figuring out how to reset the game state within a single session. It may sound trivial, but as Singh explains, the challenge lies in pre-planning and managing all variables in the codebase to ensure values reset properly at the end of the game. “You don’t want to discover at the last moment that you haven’t planned for something as basic as replayability.”He also had to remain mindful of Snap’s file-size limit. The target for spectacles is 25 MB, so it forces developers to think carefully about asset sizes and code efficiency. As Singh points out, a single highresolution image file might be several megabytes, so you learn to compress or simplify it, or even switch to 3D models that can be more storage-friendly. Yet, for all these constraints, he says building the game took only about four weeks from start to finish. “Once you get the hang of optimising your assets and planning your logic, a robust experience can come together fairly quickly.”Another developer and agency founder, Kavin K, echoes the sentiment that people might be surprised at how easy it’s becoming to build AR experiences.Having worked in AR for a few years, Kavin has now started experimenting with linking generative AI to real-time AR overlays so that the glasses can help with day-to-day tasks in a style reminiscent of fictional AI assistants in superhero films.“I’m trying to build a Jarvis-like assistant,” he says, describing how the glasses could eventually identify tasks, show relevant data, and even talk back in a helpful manner as you go about your routine. When asked whether this was the sort of problem that only Google or Apple might solve at scale, he concedes that big tech companies certainly have large R&D budgets, but stresses that the barrier to entry for smaller developers is not as daunting as one might think.“With Snap’s Lens Studio,” he says, “you can create no-code prototypes using the Patch Editor or dive deeper by scripting advanced logic. If you have a background in game development in engines like Unity, you have already won half the battle.”Many attendees at the AR Day event described their first experience with the spectacles as a moment of revelation. The Indian developer ecosystem is especially poised to benefit from this wave. Many already have backgrounds in app and game development, and the leap into AR is smaller than it might appear. “AR is no longer some unreachable technology for the privileged few,” Singh points out. “It’s already in use at e-commerce giants, in social media, and soon, with wearable devices, it’s going to expand far beyond that.”","Snap, the parent company of snapchat, held their ar day at a mumbai film studio on wednesday.

"Amazon reports strong earnings for Q4, but stocks dip due to outlook for the 1st quarter",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/amazon-reports-strong-earnings-for-q4-but-stocks-dip-due-to-outlook-for-the-1st-quarter/articleshow/117998797.cms,"Amazon on Thursday reported better-than-expected revenue and profits for the holiday shopping period, but its stocks dipped in after-hours trading due to disappointing guidance for the current quarter.The Seattle-based e-commerce and technology company said its revenue for the October-December period totaled $187.8 billion, a 10% jump compared to the same period in 2023. Profits came out to $20 billion while earnings per share reached $1.86, higher than the $1.49 that analysts surveyed by FactSet had anticipated.But the company said it expected revenue for the current quarter to be between $151 billion and 155.5 billion, lower than the $158.56 billion that analysts were expecting. The guidance anticipates ""an unusually large, unfavorable impact"" from foreign exchange rates, it said.Amazon is the biggest online shopping destination in the U.S. and has long been a beneficiary of consumer spending during the holidays. As it has done in recent years, the company in October began offering promotions intended to lure early holiday shoppers. It advertised other discounts during the three-month period, including on major sales days such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.Amazon on Thursday reported it saw $75.5 billion in revenue for its online shopping business, up 7% from the same period in 2023.Across the retail industry, holiday sales in November and December were better than expected compared with the previous year as lower inflation on holiday goods enticed shoppers to buy, according to The National Retail Federation. Online shopping also saw record sales levels, Adobe Analytics reported in January.Sales for Amazon Web services, the company's prominent cloud computing unit, rose 19% during the fourth quarter. But it fell slightly below analysts expectations.Amazon is one of the biggest players in the competitive tech race around generative artificial intelligence. Like other tech companies, it has ramped up investments in the technology and is spending billions to expand data centers that support AI and cloud computing. The company is also spending money on other equipment, including its own computer chips and those developed by Nvidia. It has also rolled out its own AI models and integrated the generative AI into other parts of its business.In the fourth quarter, Amazon reported spending $27.8 billion on property and equipment, significantly higher than the same period in 2023. Most of the spending was geared towards AI and AWS, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during a call with analysts on Thursday.""We think virtually every application that we know of today is going to be re-invented with AI inside of it,"" Jassy said. ""I think both our business, our customers and shareholders will be happy medium-to-long term that we're pursuing the capital opportunity and the business opportunity in AI.""Jassy also said during the call that Amazon, like many others, was ""impressed"" by DeepSeek, the Chinese artificial intelligence company whose chatbot recently became the most downloaded app in the U.S.Amazon's quarterly report also comes as the retail industry is absorbing a new 10% tariff President Donald Trump imposed on Chinese imports on Tuesday. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been put on hold for about a month.Trump also thew out a trade exemption that allowed low-value shipments from China to bypass duties, a loophole that had given an advantage to China-founded e-commerce firms, such as Shein and Temu.The new tariffs could benefit Amazon by increasing costs for its competitors. But it would also impact Chinese sellers who connect with American consumers on the company's shopping platform. Furthermore, it could raise prices on a recently-launched online storefront that Amazon set up to ship low-cost products directly from China. The storefront, called Amazon Haul, was Amazon's answer to Shein and Temu.Additionally, analysts from Morgan Stanley wrote in a Monday note that Amazon's first-party retail business, though which the company sells products purchased from manufacturers, has the highest exposure to the tariffs. The analysts estimate 25% of the merchandise sold through that business comes from China.","Amazon reported better-than-expected revenue and profits for the holiday shopping period.
