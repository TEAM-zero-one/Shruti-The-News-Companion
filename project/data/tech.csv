Complying with NCLAT directions on privacy: Meta and WhatsApp,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/complying-with-nclat-directions-on-privacy-meta-and-whatsapp/articleshow/128733788.cms,".

NEW DELHI: Social media giants Meta and WhatsApp on Monday told the Supreme Court that they would not insist on a stay of appellate company law tribunal (NCLAT) order prohibiting them from sharing data for non-core services and directing them to give users a transparent opt-out option for withdrawal of consent for such sharing.Two weeks after SC severely criticised them on data sharing and the complicated process for withdrawal of users' consent, senior advocate Kapil Sibal informed a bench of CJI Surya Kant, Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi that both Meta and WhatsApp will be fully compliant with the NCLAT directions on these two counts within the three month timeframe, that is by March 16.Though the bench disposed of the two applications by Meta and WhatsApp seeking stay of the NCLAT order, senior advocate Madhavi Divan, appearing for Competition Commission of India (CCI), said the main issue is the direction of the regulator imposing a five-year ban on data sharing for advertisement purposes. SC posted further hearing on Apr 19. Sibal attempted to skirt the issue by first arguing that it can be decided during the final hearing on the appeals filed by Meta, WhatsApp and CCI and later by arguing that the companies are mandated by law to be compliant with Digital Personal Data Protection (DPDP) Act by June 2027.Divan said that the NCLAT had stayed one of the crucial directions by the regulator to WhatsApp not to share user data collected on its platform with other Meta Companies or Meta Company Products for advertisement purposes for five years.This needs to be adjudicated and an interim stay of the direction of NCLAT on this issue is needed, she said, adding that this is despite NCLAT agreeing with CCI that the these two companies enjoyed dominant position in market and cross-sharing of data between them enhanced Meta's competitive advantage in display advertising market, which created barriers for rivals that did not have comparable access to WhatsApp data.CCI said, if the five-year ban on data sharing for advertising purposes is not enforced ""grave prejudice would be caused to the market for OTT messaging apps on smartphones in India and market for Online Display Advertising in India.""",Social media giants meta and whatsapp told the supreme court that they would not insist on a stay of appellate company law tribunal (nclat) order.

DNPA conclave 2026 to discuss how trust and credibility will decide next decade of news,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dnpa-conclave-2026-to-discuss-how-trust-and-credibility-will-decide-next-decade-of-news/articleshow/128720852.cms,"Trust and credibility will take centre stage at the DNPA Conclave 2026, where industry leaders are set to debate how confidence in news brands will determine the future of journalism in the coming decade.With digital platforms saturated by content and misinformation growing more sophisticated, discussions at the conclave will revolve around a central premise: trust is no longer a soft value but operational infrastructure for news organisations.Discussion on this profoundly relevant issue will be held at length during the Digital News Publishers Association (DNPA) Conclave 2026, which will be held in New Delhi on February 26. The theme for this year is 'The New World Order of News: Rewriting the Playbook for a Resilient Digital Future'.Participants are expected to examine what many describe as “post-virality fatigue”, a phase in which audiences, far from being more gullible, are becoming increasingly sceptical and selective about sources. Industry executives argue that scale without credibility is unsustainable, particularly as scrutiny intensifies across platforms.Another key theme will be the credibility dilemma posed by artificial intelligence. As AI tools make content creation faster and cheaper, verification and editorial rigour are emerging as the primary differentiators. In this context, trust is being viewed not merely as a brand attribute but as a systemic capability embedded in newsroom processes.The conclave will also focus on advertiser alignment, with brands now evaluating the quality and safety of publishing environments rather than chasing raw impressions. Executives are expected to discuss how premium partnerships, subscriptions and reader-supported models increasingly hinge on perceived credibility.Industry leaders are likely to discuss how trust directly influences discoverability on digital platforms, audience retention and long-term revenue resilience. With regulatory scrutiny and public expectations rising globally, transparency and accountability mechanisms are also expected to feature prominently in discussions.The broader takeaway underpinning the event: in the coming decade, trust will not simply amplify journalism, it may determine whether it survives.The DNPA is a premier Indian industry body representing leading digital media organisations across the country.

DNPA Conclave 2026 to focus on media’s move from traffic to relevance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dnpa-conclave-2026-to-focus-on-medias-move-from-traffic-to-relevance/articleshow/128707471.cms,".

The Indian media industry is quietly changing course, prioritising long-term relevance, rather than chasing traffic. For years, publishers prioritised reach above all, chasing traffic spikes. But the volatility of platform-driven distribution has exposed weak foundations- high numbers, but little loyalty or ownership. Publishers are now rethinking what they truly stand for and how to maintain a direct connection with their audiences.This shift is strategic, not ideological. News organisations are rediscovering the value of identity, consistency, and control. Email newsletters, apps, community spaces, and subscription models are gaining focus as publishers seek deeper, more meaningful engagement. Internal conversations increasingly measure success by engagement depth rather than sheer volume.These trends will be discussed in detail at the Digital News Publishers Association (DNPA) Conclave 2026 in New Delhi on 26 February.

"DNPA Conclave 2026: Time for digital media to lead change, not just react to it",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/dnpa-conclave-2026-time-for-digital-media-to-lead-change-not-just-react-to-it/articleshow/128712547.cms,"-

2026 is not just another year on the media calendar. It marks the convergence of long-standing, unresolved questions that can no longer be deferred. It is fast emerging as a decisive inflection point for India’s digital news industry. What makes this moment distinct is not disruption itself, but the industry’s growing fatigue with disruption, an exhaustion that signals it is time to move from reacting to change to defining what comes next.For more than a decade, change in digital media arrived in waves: technology first, then audience behaviour, followed by revenue models and regulation. Today those waves have converged into a single tide. Artificial intelligence is scaling faster than governance frameworks can evolve. Advertisers are demanding sharper accountability and measurable returns. Audiences, overwhelmed by information and misinformation, are becoming more selective about whom they trust. None of this is unfolding sequentially; it is happening all at once. The result is a compressed cycle of transformation where adaptation is immediate rather than optional.Against this backdrop, DNPA Conclave 2026 emerges as a critical platform for dialogue and direction.To be held in New Delhi on February 26 under the theme “The New World Order of News: Rewriting the Playbook for a Resilient Digital Future,” the conclave will bring together policymakers, media leaders, and industry experts to examine the intersections of news, governance, and digital innovation. Through discussions and expert-led sessions, it will highlight emerging trends, shared challenges, and the strategic roadmap for India’s evolving digital news ecosystem.For years, publishers relied on pilots, beta models, and platform-driven strategies to buy time. That time is over. In 2026, experimentation must give way to execution and measurable outcomes. Leaders are moving from testing possibilities to choosing directions. The industry is shifting from trial mode to decision mode, and those decisions will define editorial identity, technological investment, and revenue architecture for the next decade.India’s digital news ecosystem remains uniquely complex. It is vast, multilingual, and demographically young, yet marked by uneven connectivity and access. Strategies that succeed in global markets cannot simply be transplanted here. Publishers must innovate locally while competing globally. This paradox is not only India’s greatest challenge, it is also its most powerful strategic advantage.Today, boardrooms and editorial leadership teams face unprecedented decision fatigue. The choices before them are not incremental but foundational. Each decision locks in a trajectory. Each delay risks irrelevance.These defining questions will take center stage at the DNPA Conclave, where leading minds in media, technology, and policy will examine the forces reshaping journalism and the digital news ecosystem.The DNPA is a premier Indian industry body representing leading digital media organisations across the country.

“World Will See AI Differently”: PM Modi On AI Impact Summit In Mann Ki Baat

NEW DELHI: Artificial intelligence may soon help doctors “read” the brain before disease becomes visible. An Indian team has unveiled MANAS 1, a Brain Language Foundation Model built on 60,000 hours of brainwave recordings from more than 25,000 patients, with the aim of enabling earlier detection of neurological and psychiatric disorders.Developed by Intellihealth (NeuroDx), led by neurologist Dr Puneet Agarwal, former Professor at All India Institutes of Medical Sciences, and his team, the model was launched during an AI summit and released as open source on Hugging Face. The project received computational backing under the Indian AI Mission of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.Unlike conventional AI systems, MANAS 1 is trained to interpret EEG signals — the electrical activity generated by the brain. Built with 400 million parameters, it is described by its developers as a foundational platform on which disease-specific AI tools can be developed.Dr Agarwal told TOI that MANAS 1 is designed to “understand the basic language of the brain.” He described it as a foundation model — similar in concept to ChatGPT — that learns from large-scale EEG data to interpret brain signals that traditional tests like MRI cannot fully decode.According to him, the model creates a platform on which AI tools for epilepsy, dementia and other disorders can later be built, while also helping researchers explore aspects of brain function that remain poorly understood.The public health argument is early access. India faces a shortage of neurologists and psychiatrists, particularly outside major cities. Brain disorders are often detected late, increasing disability and long-term costs. The developers say tools built on MANAS 1 could assist doctors at Ayushman Arogya Mandirs, community health centres and district hospitals in preliminary screening and timely referral. Any disease-specific AI model derived from the platform would require regulatory approvals before clinical deployment.If validated at scale, such systems could help reduce the gap between symptom onset and diagnosis — a critical factor in conditions such as epilepsy and dementia.A next-generation version, MANAS 2, is expected in the coming weeks.As artificial intelligence advances into neuroscience, MANAS 1 signals an attempt to move from analysing language on screens to interpreting the electrical language of the brain — with implications for research, diagnosis and access to care.","Manas 1 is a brain language foundation model built on 60,000 hours of brainwave recordings from more than 25,000 patients.

Apple is preparing to launch its new devices next week. The Cupertino-based tech giant has scheduled a launch ‘Apple Experience’ event for March 4, the company is expected to launch at least five new products. According to Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple plans a three-day flurry of announcements beginning March 2 and culminating in an in-person press event on March 4 in New York, London and Shanghai. “As for what items are actually coming, I’m told Apple will introduce at least five products. They could span hardware, software and chips. A new low-cost MacBook will very likely be one of the introductions. After all, the invitation includes the colors the device will launch in,” reads the report.Among the rumoured products are:Apple is expected to launch the iPhone 17e, which will replace the iPhone 16e introduced last year. The upcoming iPhone 17e is said to be powered by the A19 chip that comes with iPhone 17. The A19 offers a modest boost in CPU speed compared to the A18, but most of its improvement is in GPU, thus allowing it to be even better for AI features and gaming. Further, the handset is tipped to get MagSafe charging feature.Another change coming the iPhone 17e is that it may be equipped with Apple’s newest in-house cellular and wireless chips. Other major new features include an 18MP front camera with Center Stage. This camera automatically extends to show everybody in a group selfie, even when you hold the phone vertically. As far as the pricing of the upcoming iPhone 17e is concerned, rumours suggest that the company is planning to keep pricing the same as iPhone 16e. To recall, iPhone 16e launched in 2025 with a price tag of $599 or Rs 59,900 in India.Apple is also expected to unveil the new iPad at the event. Apple is said to be preparing a refreshed entry-level iPad with the A18 chip, which would bring support for Apple Intelligence for the first time. New iPad Air models are tipped to move to the M4 chip. Design changes are expected to be limited, though the iPad mini is reported to switch to an OLED display.Apple is also working on new Macs, including updated MacBook Air, 14-inch and 16-inch MacBook Pro models powered by the M5 chip. Apple MacBook Air is said to feature Apple’s N1 networking chip which is said to improve the connectivity and wireless speed of the device. On the other hand, the Apple MacBook Pro will mainly focus on performance improvement and any major design changes are not expected.One of the key launches in the first half of the year could be a low-cost MacBook with a screen under 13 inches, powered by an iPhone-class chip. The device is expected to compete with budget Windows laptops and Chromebooks, and is likely to be positioned as an entry point into the Mac ecosystem for new users.","Apple's new event is set to take place on march 4 in new york, london and shanghai.

If accurate, this would make GTA 6 one of the most expensive “standard edition” games ever released. Along with this, the listing also showed a PC code for the Rockstar Games Launcher priced at £60.99. However, the industry watchers cautioned that these prices are likely placeholder prices which is a common practice that takes place ahead of popular game launches.The leaked digital listing suggests that Grand Theft Auto VI could carry a hefty price tag, with the standard edition appearing online at around $99.99 USD. This would make GTA 6 one of the most expensive mainstream titles ever released, surpassing the $70 benchmark that has become common for AAA games in recent years. The listing, spotted on the storefront Loaded (formerly CD Keys), showed the Xbox version priced at £89.99, while a PC code for Rockstar’s launcher appeared at £60.99.The game is likely to feature a massive open-world map inspired by modern-day Florida, dual protagonists, and enhanced gameplay mechanics.Online reports suggest that GTA will feature a female protagonist, Lucia for the first time, alongside a male character.

Briscoe's net worth, increasing earnings, and contract growth

Briscoe's financial future ahead of the 2026 season

Chase Briscoe has become one of the best up-and-coming stars in all of NASCAR racing, rising from dirt track to full-time race car driver in the Cup Series. Recently spotted at the Autotrader 400 at EchoPark Speedway, the racer proved his mettle by finishing second at the Sunday race. As he prepares to enter the 2026 season behind the wheel of the No. 19 for Joe Gibbs Racing, many fans and analysts are curious to know just how lucrative his career has been. Briscoe's financial journey is indicative of not only what he has accomplished on the track but also how much more desirable he has become off the track as a marketable brand and motorsports personality.Briscoe's estimated net worth has steadily increased over the past few years as his holdings in the NASCAR stock have increased. Reports put his net worth at around $5.6 million in 2025, including base salary, endorsements, and racing earnings. Moreover, industry observers expect his wealth to increase even more in 2026 as his profile becomes even stronger. His move to Joe Gibbs Racing in 2025 was a turning point in his career. While specific details of the impacts of the contract are not publicized in the sport of stock car racing, Briscoe's contract base salary was widely reported to be closer to $1.2 million for the 2025 season, a clear increase from earlier years.However, this number doesn't include performance bonuses, race winnings, or incentive pay that can have a huge impact on a driver's annual income.Beyond the salary, Briscoe's net worth is bolstered by a strong list of sponsorships and endorsements. He has the support of major brands including Bass Pro Shops, Aqua Hydrate, HighPoint, and Mobil 1, among others. His marketability continues to rise with new deals such as a three-race Primary Sponsorship from Columbia Bank in 2026, underlining his appeal to corporate partners. These earnings streams can be seen together to paint the picture of a driver whose value in the sport stretches far outside of his racecar seat.While race, salary, and endorsements are the backbone of his earnings, there are several factors that could affect the financial growth of Briscoe that are ahead of him for the 2026 season. Continued success in the track, deeper runs in the playoffs, in the race to the checkered flag in the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, and the growth of sponsor portfolios all have the potential to increase his annual income and long-term net worth. As of 2026, Briscoe’s estimated net worth sits comfortably in the $6 million–$7 million range, reflecting his strong performances, team contracts, sponsorship deals, and off-track income.In a sport in which performance, personality, and brand alignment are all important, Chase Briscoe's financial journey speaks to an equal balance of all three, making Briscoe not only a competitor but a commercial draw well into 2026 and beyond.","Chase briscoe has become one of the best up-and-coming stars in all of nascar racing, rising from dirt track to full-time race car driver in the cup series.

Indian-origin billionaire Vinod Khosla launched a blistering attack on US lawmakers Bernie Sanders and Ro Khanna in a post on X, criticising their warnings about artificial intelligence. Khosla wrote: “Bernie Sanders, Ro Khanna warn of AI’s potential negative consequences. Morons like Ro Khanna and Bernie Sanders will stop all the good AI can do to protect their religion. Good intentions but bad outcomes is ok for these socialists/ commie.” The post came after Sanders and Khanna spoke at a public discussion on artificial intelligence at Stanford University.The exchange followed a Stanford town hall on February 20, 2026, where Sanders argued that artificial intelligence is advancing faster than existing economic and political systems can absorb. He cast doubt on Silicon Valley’s claims that AI will naturally deliver broad public benefits, saying similar assurances had been made during previous waves of technological change while wealth and power became more concentrated. Sanders warned that rapid AI deployment, if left largely to market forces, could accelerate job losses and widen inequality.Khanna, who represents a Silicon Valley district, set out what he called a framework for “democratic AI”, contending that current AI development trends favour large technology firms.He said AI systems should prioritise worker augmentation over replacement and suggested policy intervention was needed to prevent productivity gains from flowing primarily to corporations. While noting potential uses of AI in areas such as healthcare and clean energy, Khanna argued these outcomes were not guaranteed and criticised what he described as Silicon Valley’s tendency to resist external oversight.Khosla, a co-founder of Sun Microsystems and a prominent investor in AI-focused companies, has repeatedly argued that excessive caution and regulation could delay breakthroughs that improve living standards. In his post responding to the Stanford event, he framed the lawmakers’ warnings as ideologically driven and said slowing AI development could block advances in healthcare, medical research, drug discovery, education, clean energy, scientific innovation and overall economic productivity, preventing the technology from delivering broader societal gains.The episode highlights widening tensions between parts of Silicon Valley and policymakers over how artificial intelligence should be governed, with disagreements increasingly playing out both at high-profile public forums and on social media platforms.","Indian-origin billionaire vinod khosla launched a blistering attack on us lawmakers bernie sanders and ro khanna in a post on x, criticising their warnings about artificial intelligence.

$12.8 million jackpot in limbo after Arizona store worker buys winning ticket – Court to decide who gets prize,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/12-8-million-jackpot-in-limbo-after-arizona-store-worker-buys-winning-ticket-court-to-decide-who-gets-prize/articleshow/128689616.cms,"



A worker at a convenience store in Arizona is in legal trouble after buying a lottery ticket worth $12.8 million from the store where he worked. A judge will now decide who should get the prize, as both the store and the worker claim it.A court complaint says the incident started on the evening of November 24, 2025, at a Circle K in Scottsdale. A customer asked for a replay of numbers for that night’s “The Pick” draw, 12News reported. The employee on duty, Robert Gawlitza, printed $85 worth of tickets, but the customer only paid $60, leaving 25 tickets on the counter.The complaint says the unsold tickets were left in the store overnight and were discovered the next morning intact. After learning that his store had sold the jackpot winner, Gawlitza reportedly checked the abandoned tickets and found the winning one. The winning numbers were 3, 13, 14, 15, 19, and 26.Gawlitza then finished his shift, took off his Circle K uniform and bought the tickets, including the winning one, from another employee for $10, according to the complaint.Store management was alerted and the ticket was taken to Circle K’s corporate office, where it is being held pending a court ruling on ownership.Circle K does not itself claim the ticket but has asked the court to determine whether it or Gawlitza is the rightful owner.

'Is it just a scam...': Row over photo of 'Indian students' at the queue of Irish university food bank,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/is-it-just-a-scam-row-over-photo-of-indian-students-at-the-queue-of-irish-university-food-bank/articleshow/128729418.cms,"



A photo published by The Irish Times triggered a fresh wave of attacks on Indians as a social media user pointed out that a man seen on the photo looked Indian. The Irish Times reported that University of Galway food bank turns away hundreds of students each week, as there is a huge demand for free food. The report narrated how 100 students were waiting for their turn at the student-operated pantry, which started as an arrangement to distribute surplus food but has now become a necessity for the students as they can't afford food because of the skyrocketing cost of living.The food bank has a lottery system which selects some and rejects many and every week, hundreds of registered students are disappointed. While the report was only about university students facing food poverty, the photo started the online debate though there was no confirmation that the student shown in the photo was Indian. But haters zoomed the photo and attempted to dox the person.""The Irish Times published an article yesterday about Galway University turning away students from a food bank. 90%+ of them were Indian nationals on student visas. Why are Indians in Ireland if they cannot support themselves, or is it just a scam to save money,"" the social media post, which started the debate, said. It was by one Peter Paul, who identifies himself as a proud Irishman.The man dug up YouTube videos made by Indians advising fellow Indians how to get free groceries in foreign countries and blamed it on Indian culture.""It's their culture. They see anything as free as a bonus no matter the cost to society,"" the man wrote as the Internet lapped up the India hatred.""Aren't they supposed to be able to support themselves as a condition of their visa?"" one asked.Many people doubted whether the students shown in the photo were all Indians and also questioned why it should be a scam if they joined the queue for the food bank along with hundreds of others.","The irish times reported that university of galway food bank turns away hundreds of students each week.

AI cyber warfare





In a weekend that tested the nation's digital resolve, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) successfully blocked a series of organized and sophisticated cyberattacks. Described by the UAE Cybersecurity Council as having a ""terrorist nature,"" these assaults directly targeted the country's vital infrastructure and national digital platforms.The shadowy attackers' primary goal was clear: to destabilize the nation, disrupt the everyday services residents rely on, and undermine the UAE’s international standing.The UAE’s Cybersecurity Council confirmed that the attempted breach was not random hacking. It was structured and technologically advanced. Attackers used artificial intelligence to enhance their operations, allowing malicious tools to adapt, evade detection and execute phishing campaigns with greater precision.Dr Mohamed Al Kuwaiti, Head of Cybersecurity for the UAE Government and Chairman of the UAE Cybersecurity Council, stated that the attacks were “complex and highly coordinated,” but were detected early through advanced monitoring systems. He added that the country’s cyber defense framework allowed authorities to “contain and neutralise” the threats before major disruption occurred.Authorities did not publicly name the perpetrators but confirmed that investigations are ongoing.Despite the attack wave's intensity, the UAE’s layered cyber defense systems absorbed the shock. Continuous monitoring, early detection mechanisms and rapid-response teams worked in sync to isolate and neutralise malicious activity before it could cause widespread damage.The country’s national cybersecurity framework, built through sustained investment and strategic coordination, proved resilient. Authorities highlighted cooperation between government bodies, service providers and international partners as a key factor in preventing escalation.The state news agency Emirates News Agency reported that systems remained operational and essential services were not disrupted. Protecting personal data and ensuring the continuity of public services were prioritised throughout the response.This incident underscores a broader global reality: cyber conflict is becoming central to national security. As governments digitise services and expand smart infrastructure, the stakes grow higher. A successful breach could paralyse financial systems, healthcare networks or transportation grids.The UAE’s experience illustrates both vulnerability and resilience. While the attempted attacks reveal how cyber threats are becoming smarter and faster, the swift containment demonstrates how proactive preparation can neutralise even advanced digital offensives.Officials have urged individuals and organisations to remain vigilant, report suspicious activity and strengthen cybersecurity hygiene. In an interconnected world, national digital security increasingly depends on collective awareness.","Uae authorities confirm ai-driven cyber attacks on critical infrastructure were blocked, preventing disruption.

Researchers find toxic plant alkaloids on 60,000-year-old ancient South African arrow tips

Evidence predates previous poisoned arrow discoveries

Wear patterns support use as poisoned arrow tips





Stone artefacts from a rock shelter in South Africa have yielded chemical traces of toxic plant compounds, offering what researchers describe as the earliest direct evidence of poisoned hunting weapons. The backed microliths were recovered from layers dated to about 60,000 years ago at Umhlatuzana Rock Shelter. Using microchemical and biomolecular testing, scientists identified alkaloids associated with poisonous plants native to the region. The findings suggest that Middle Stone Age hunters applied plant-derived toxins to arrow tips far earlier than previously confirmed. Until now, secure chemical evidence of poisoned weapons has been dated to much later periods. The new analysis places this behaviour deep in the Pleistocene and adds detail to discussions about early human technology and subsistence strategies in southern Africa.Researchers analysed residue visible on ten small quartz-backed pieces believed to have served as arrow tips. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry revealed plant-derived alkaloids on five of the artefacts. Two compounds, buphanidrine and epibuphanisine, were detected.Both chemicals are associated with plants in the Amaryllidaceae family. In southern Africa, the most likely source is Boophone disticha, a species historically recorded as an ingredient in arrow poisons. Comparative tests on modern plant extracts confirmed matching chemical signatures. The compounds are relatively stable, which may explain their preservation over tens of thousands of years.Before this study, the oldest confirmed poisoned arrows dated to the mid-Holocene, only a few thousand years ago. Earlier sites had produced indirect hints, including possible poison applicators and residues on other materials, but not clear chemical proof on weapon tips themselves.The Umhlatuzana microliths come from sediment layers dated to roughly 60,000 years ago. Geological and sediment studies at the site indicate that, despite minor disturbance, the layers remain sufficiently intact to link the artefacts and residues to that time period. This pushes back firm evidence of plant-based poison use by tens of thousands of years.Microscopic wear and fracture patterns on the quartz pieces indicate impact at high speed. Residue distribution suggests the microliths were hafted transversely onto shafts, consistent with known arrow designs from later periods.It looks like the poison was mixed into the glue that was used to hold the stone tip in place. That tiny detail matters. It means planning instead of coming into contact with poisonous plants by accident.When you look at the chemical clues and wear patterns together, they show that the hunting system was planned. Picking out certain plants, turning them into poisons, mixing them with glues, and putting them on weapons all suggest skill and shared practice. Hunters in southern Africa were already using complex plant science to find prey 60,000 years ago.","60,000-year-old stone arrows from south africa carry traces of plant-based poison.

China has a new competitor?

Kazakhstan’s rare earth deposit reveals massive potential for clean energy and tech



Rare earth mining in Kazakhstan faces long timelines, high costs, and logistics challenges



Kazakhstan’s rare Earths’ grab global attention





Kazakhstan, mostly known for oil and endless steppes, has now suddenly made a discovery that might put it on the tech map. Under the Karagandy region, geologists reportedly found a rare earth deposit that could rank among the world’s largest. It contains neodymium, cerium, lanthanum, and yttrium, which you find in electric cars, wind turbines, and even smartphones.This discovery almost seems unreal. Experts say this could shift Kazakhstan from a transit hub to a serious player in high-tech supply chains. China’s grip might finally see some competition.Preliminary estimates suggest around 935,400 metric tons of rare earth oxides. Some informal numbers hint that the total ore body could be as high as 20 million tons, averaging 700 grams per ton. Locals have started calling the site “New Kazakhstan.” The minerals themselves are tiny in volume but vital for lean energy, electronics, and the military.Geologists stress caution. “To call it a deposit, you need a full study on hydrology, geomechanics, and economics,” said Georgiy Freiman from PONEN at the 2025 MINEX Forum. Exploration began in 2022. By late 2024, internal reports reached the government. Just before the EU–Central Asia Summit.Observers say it’s clearly a signal: Kazakhstan wants to show it’s serious about minerals. Not just oil, not just transit, but strategic resources too.Mining won’t start overnight. Some insiders say large-scale extraction might take until 2031. Investments could start around $10 million but that doesn’t include refineries or transport. Kazakhstan has no domestic rare earth refining. Partnerships will be essential. Tau-Ken Samruk, the state mining company, is reportedly leading technical studies with Canada’s Ivanhoe Mines. They’re testing “Typhoon” deep-detection tech.Foreign companies are paying attention. Over $1 billion in private investment flowed in from 2020 to 2025. Firms like Rio Tinto, BHP, Fortescue, and Barrick. South Korea’s KIGAM is also on site, using AI surveys to speed up exploration. China still dominates rare earths. Around 70% of output, refining 85%. That concentration worries many. Kazakhstan’s new role might shift the balance, even a little. Formal classification hasn’t happened yet. Environmental and commercial studies will continue into 2026. Officials haven’t confirmed licenses or refining plans.","Kazakhstan has made a rare earth deposit that could rank among the world’s largest.

Ways to contribute









An anonymous philanthropist has contributed AED35 million to the ‘Edge of Life’ campaign, a Ramadan initiative launched to help rescue five million children from hunger. The campaign aims to raise at least AED1 billion to fund sustainable programmes addressing childhood malnutrition worldwide.The ‘Edge of Life’ campaign was launched during Ramadan by His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President, Prime Minister and Ruler of Dubai. It seeks to mobilise large-scale funding to support long-term solutions to child hunger rather than short-term relief.The campaign’s target is a minimum of AED1 billion. Funds raised will be invested in sustainable programmes designed to prevent and treat malnutrition among children in vulnerable communities across the world.The initiative builds on a long-standing humanitarian vision championed by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum. Efforts to combat hunger are viewed as a continuing moral responsibility rather than a response to a temporary emergency.The campaign operates under the umbrella of Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives. It has attracted participation from individuals, institutions and businesses, reflecting the UAE community’s culture of giving and its commitment to supporting humanitarian projects that serve underserved populations globally.To ensure effective implementation, the campaign is organised in partnership with UNICEF, Save the Children, the Children’s Investment Fund Foundation and Action Against Hunger. These organisations provide expertise and operational capacity to deliver measurable impact on the ground.The number 11.5 associated with the campaign refers to the mid-upper arm circumference measurement used to detect acute malnutrition in children aged between six months and five years.According to World Health Organisation guidelines, a measurement below 11.5 centimetres is among the indicators used to diagnose severe acute malnutrition. The campaign highlights this figure to underline the urgency of early detection and intervention.The campaign continues to welcome donations through seven main channels.Contributions can be made via the official website at www.edgeoflife.ae or through the toll-free call centre number 800 4999.Bank transfers in UAE dirhams can be directed to the campaign account at Emirates Islamic Bank using IBAN AE940340003708472909222.Donations can also be sent by SMS by texting the word “LIFE” to du and e& numbers: 1034 to donate AED10, 1035 for AED50, 1036 for AED100 and 1038 for AED500.Additional platforms include the DubaiNow app, YallaGive.com under the “Donations” tab and Dubai’s community contributions platform Jood at Jood.ae.With significant backing already secured, the campaign continues to gather support as it works towards its goal of protecting millions of children from hunger.","Anonymous philanthropist donates aed35 million to 'edge of life' campaign fighting childhood hunger.

"'Indian nepotism, no gaming background': Internet slams Microsoft for hiring Asha Sharma as CEO of Xbox",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/indian-nepotism-no-gaming-background-internet-slams-microsoft-for-hiring-asha-sharma-as-ceo-of-xbox-gaming/articleshow/128643266.cms,"The criticism comes amid political debate in the United States, particularly among sections of the MAGA conservative base, where Indian-origin executives and the H1-B visa programme have come under scrutiny. High-profile Indian-origin figures such as FBI director Kash Patel, second lady Usha Vance and former DOGE lead Vivek Ramaswamy have also drawn attention.

Several users also took a closer look at Sharma’s professional history. One post circulating on X reproduced details from her LinkedIn profile and claimed she had “Never held a postion for more than 4 years (climbing the corp ladder)”. The post pointed to her previous roles to question the depth of her long-term leadership experience.

Some of the users defended the decision of Microsoft, arguing that a chief executive does not need to design or play video games to run a gaming business and that the hate against Asha stems from racism against Indians.

Microsoft’s gaming division has faced a difficult decade. After strong competition with Sony and Nintendo, the previous CEO, Spencer, admitted in 2024 that the 2013 Xbox One “lost the worst generation to lose.” The company has spent heavily on acquisitions, including a $69 billion purchase of Activision Blizzard, in a push to expand beyond consoles into PC and mobile gaming. It has also laid off more than 2,500 gaming employees since 2024 and shut several studios.

In an email to staff, Sharma said: “We will recommit to our core Xbox fans and players, those who have invested with us for the past 25 years, and to the developers who build the expansive universes and experiences that are embraced by players across the world,” she wrote.

She added: “We will celebrate our roots with a renewed commitment to Xbox starting with console, which has shaped who we are.”





A leadership shake-up at Microsoft’s gaming arm sparked online backlash, with gamers accusing the company of “Indian nepotism” after it named AI executive Asha Sharma as the new head of Xbox.Microsoft Corp confirmed that Sharma will take over as chief executive of its gaming division, replacing Xbox boss Phil Spencer, who is retiring.Xbox President Sarah Bond is also set to leave, while games studios chief Matt Booty will become chief content officer, reporting to Sharma. The announcement was made by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella in a blog post on Friday.Sharma most recently served as President of Core AI Product at Microsoft and was selected for her consumer and product expertise. She previously held senior roles at Instacart and Meta, and has also sat on the boards of The Home Depot and Coupang.Earlier in her career, she worked in Microsoft’s marketing department before leaving in 2013, only to return two years ago in a senior AI leadership role.However, the appointment has triggered criticism on X, where several users questioned her lack of direct experience in the gaming industry. One user wrote: “Asha Sharma, the new head of Xbox, is an AI executive with no background in gaming.”Another user said that her appointment aligns with the trend of Indians ""stealing"" American jobs in the US: “Microsoft is literally just indian nepotism now. That’s the whole company. Have you wondered why they rolled out an update that bricked hundreds of thousands of computers? Why OneDrive doesn’t work but keeps enabling itself? Why an instacart employee is handling gaming? Indian nepotism. That’s the whole company now.”A further comment read: “I’m sure I need 6 years of software development experience, a 4.0 GPA at a top university, and 20 side projects to get a minimum wage internship at Microsoft, but the CEO knows nothing about video games.”Another user asked: “Why is every American tech company run by Indians now?”","Asha sharma will take over as chief executive of microsoft's gaming division.

Two H-1B lotteries this year?

Questions in the new H-1B registration form





Immigration attorney Emily Neumann said there is a possibility of lower H-1B registration this year when the H-1B cap initial registration period opens on March 4, because of the new $100,000 fee and also owing to the present situation of the job market. The window for registration will open from noon Eastern on March 4 to noon Eastern March 19. In this time period, petitioners have to register each beneficiary they want to hire for the selection process and pay the registration fee of $215. The selection results will be known by March 31.The $100,000 fee will be applicable when the candidate is selected, if they are outside the US.Neumann said that some companies are going ahead to register their H-1B candidates, knowing that they will have to pay $100,000. They are ready to wait and watch if those candidates get selected or not. Some companies are also hoping that the H-1B visa fee may get blocked by the court as there are two ongoing cases against the fee. If the H-1B visa fee remains, those companies may not file the final petition even after the selection of their candidates. ""That means we might have a second lottery because if people are selected in the first round and then the companies don't file to fill up the cap, we can see a second lottery happening this year,"" Neumann explained.For the first time, the selection process will not be a random lottery. It will prioritize allocating visas to higher-skilled and higher-paid workers. Neumann said she got a peek into the new registration form and it asks the beneficiary's name, date of birth, country, passport, whether filing in the master's cap or in the bachelor's cap.While these are the general questions already present in previous forms, the new question this year will ask the petitioner about the wage level. In that section, the applicants have to select from 1, 2, 3, or 4. Another new question asks about the area of intended employment, but Neumann said there is no option given, and it's just a text box. ""We don't know what they want. Do they want the city, state, county, address.. .they didn't say anything,"" the lawyer explained, adding that the new form surprisingly does not ask about the salary, the SOC code, or job title.","The h-1b cap initial registration period opens on march 4.
