New Delhi: Ruling that right to digital access is an intrinsic part of the fundamental right to life and liberty , Supreme Court Wednesday said it is a constitutional imperative for the Centre and its authorities to bridge the digital divide faced by large sections of the country's rural population, senior citizens, economically weaker communities, linguistic minorities and differently-abled persons.SC passed a slew of directions to revise the current KYC process for visually- and hearing-impaired users, and to develop alternative formats - including Braille and voice-enabled services - to ensure accessibility for all.At this juncture, we may also wish to observe that in the contemporary era, where access to essential services, governance, education, healthcare and economic opportunities is increasingly mediated through digital platforms, the right to life under Article 21 of the Constitution must be reinterpreted in light of these technological realities. The digital divide — characterised by unequal access to digital infrastructure, skills, and content — continues to perpetuate systemic exclusion, not only of persons with disabilities, but also of large sections of rural populations, senior citizens, economically weaker communities, and linguistic minorities. The principle of substantive equality demands that digital transformation be both inclusive and equitable,” Supreme Court said.Justice R Mahadevan, who penned the verdict for the bench also comprising Justices J B Pardiwala, on petitions filed by two acid attack victims who suffer facial disfigurement and 100% blindness, said that true inclusion requires that technological advancements accommodate the diverse needs of all citizens, thereby fostering an environment where no individual is left behind. The petitioners alleged that they are facing difficulties in completing the digital KYC/e-KYC process due to their inability to click a “live photograph” by blinking and which has prevented them from opening a bank account and purchasing a SIM card from the telecom providers.Allowing their plea, the bench directed govt authorities including RBI to issue guidelines to adopt alternative modes for verifying the “liveness” or capturing a “live photograph” of the customers for the purpose of conducting digital KYC to ensure inclusivity and user-convenience. It also ordered them to continue with the paper-based KYC process.“Bridging the digital divide is no longer merely a matter of policy discretion but has become a constitutional imperative to secure a life of dignity, autonomy and equal participation in public life. Right to digital access, therefore, emerges as an intrinsic component of right to life and liberty, necessitating that State proactively design and implement inclusive digital ecosystems that serve not only privileged but also the marginalised, those who have been historically excluded,” it said.","Sc passed a slew of directions to revise the current kyc process for visually- and hearing-impaired users, and to develop alternative formats. The principle of substantive equality demands that digital transformation be both inclusive and equitable, supreme court said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120776603,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-157042,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Former NBA star turned sports analyst Shaquille O’Neal, known for his lavish car collection, recently joked that he calls his cars his 'girlfriends.' However, he has now said goodbye to two of his Tesla Cybertruck s due to their limited charge mileage. One of the trucks had even been customized to his liking.

Not only this, he also mentioned how the generous Shaq once gifted a van to a family with many kids.Talking about why he got rid of his Cybertrucks, Shaq said, “I was into Cybertrucks but they don’t give enough charge mileage. Then I just got one of those IQs system Escalades. Today I was in Vegas, I ain’t have to charge up for four days. My Cybertruck here, if I go downtown to work tonight and come back, I’m gonna be struggling to get back. Right now it says 267. If I go to Atlanta to the thing and come back, when I come back it ain’t going to be…”The Cadillac Escalade IQ has a much better mileage on a single charge than the Tesla Cybertruck. While the Cybertruck can give around 510 km per charge, the Cadillac Escalade can give 745 km per charge, reportedly.When another guest mentioned how Shaq always brings the most expensive cars to work when he goes to the set of Inside The NBA, Shaq joked, “I treat them like girlfriends, my police car girlfriend I haven’t seen in a while so I will probably take her on a date tonight. But I am leaving tomorrow for another week so I will probably take my favorite girlfriend out tonight.”Also Read: Gilbert Arenas' son Alijah Arenas hospitalized following Tesla Cybertruck crash, graphic footage surfaces Recently, former NBA player Gilbert Arenas' son Alijah Arenas had a serious accident when his Tesla Cybertruck crashed into a tree near his home.

Just that soft-launch energy that says, “Yeah, it’s what you think.”It didn’t take long for fans to zero in on the pic. Within minutes, the comments were flooded with reactions.Not everyone’s onboard with Sauce and Ice Spice’s new public status. Some fans are calling it a “bad move” for Sauce’s career, arguing that he could do better and questioning whether this relationship is a distraction. A few even took to social media to suggest that this pairing might mark the beginning of the end for Sauce’s career.This surprise drop didn’t come out of nowhere. For months, fans have speculated something was going on between the NFL defensive star and the Bronx-born rapper. There were quiet rumors, anonymous tips on gossip blogs, and even a few blurry fan-captured pics of them spotted in New York together.Still, nothing concrete—until now.While neither of them has commented publicly (yet), the IG post feels like a soft-confirmation.

Read Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan full letter to employees

Team,

Today we reported our Q1 2025 results. It was a step in the right direction as we delivered revenue, gross margin and EPS (earnings per share) above our guidance, driven by Dave and Michelle’s leadership. I want to thank them both, and all of you, for the good execution.

We need to build on this progress — and it won’t be easy. We are navigating an increasingly volatile and uncertain macroeconomic environment, which is reflected in our Q2 outlook. On top of that, there are many areas where we must improve. We need to confront our challenges head-on and take swift actions to get back on track.

As I have said, this starts by revamping our culture. The feedback I have received from our customers and many of you has been consistent. We are seen as too slow, too complex and too set in our ways — and we need to change.

Our flatter Executive Team (ET) structure that I shared last week was a first step. The next step is to drive greater simplicity, speed and collaboration across the entire company. To achieve these objectives, today I am announcing some important changes.

Becoming an Engineering-Focused Company

We need to get back to our roots and empower our engineers. That’s why I elevated our core engineering functions to the ET. And many of the changes we will be driving are designed to make engineers more productive by removing burdensome workflows and processes that slow down the pace of innovation.

To make necessary investments in our engineering talent and technology roadmaps, we need to find new ways to reduce our costs. While we have taken significant actions in the last year, our current cost structure is still well above competitive benchmarks. With that in mind, we have reduced our operating expense and capital spending targets going forward, which I will discuss during our investor call this afternoon.

Flattening the Organization

As we refocus on engineering, we will also remove organizational complexity. Many teams are eight or more layers deep, which creates unnecessary bureaucracy that slows us down. I have asked the ET to take a fresh look at their respective orgs, with a focus on removing layers, increasing spans of control and empowering top performers. Our competitors are lean, fast and agile — and that’s what we must become to improve our execution.

I’ve been surprised to learn that, in recent years, the most important KPI for many managers at Intel has been the size of their teams. Going forward, this will not be the case. I’m a big believer in the philosophy that the best leaders get the most done with the fewest people. We will embrace this mindset across the company, which will include empowering our top talent to make decisions and take greater ownership of key priorities.

There is no way around the fact that these critical changes will reduce the size of our workforce. As I said when I joined, we need to make some very hard decisions to put our company on a solid footing for the future. This will begin in Q2 and we will move as quickly as possible over the next several months.

We are going to be very intentional about where we focus these efforts and how we stack up against the best in the industry. We have learned some valuable lessons from past actions. We must balance our reductions with the need to retain and recruit key talent. I will empower each of my leaders to make the best possible decisions aligned with our top priorities. These decisions will not be made lightly, and we will keep you regularly informed.

Streamlining Our Processes

It has been eye-opening for me to see how much time and energy is spent on internal administrative work that does not move our business forward. We need to radically simplify this to maximize the time spent focusing on our customers.

I am instructing our leaders to eliminate unnecessary meetings and significantly reduce the number of meeting attendees. Too much valuable time is being wasted. We will also modernize processes with a focus on live dashboards and better data to ensure we have the real-time insights we need to make better and faster decisions.

In addition, I have decided to make our formal Insights and OKR requirements optional. While it’s crucial for us to stay accountable for our results and receive feedback on our performance, I believe we can achieve this in a simpler and more flexible way. Along the same lines, we will cut back on time-consuming corporate administrative tasks such as non-essential training and documentation.

Returning to the Office

Our existing policy is that our hybrid employees should spend approximately three days per week on site. Adherence to this policy has been uneven at best. I strongly believe that our sites need to be vibrant hubs of collaboration that reflect our culture in action.

When we spend time together in person, it fosters more engaging and productive discussion and debate. It drives better and faster decision-making. And it strengthens our connection with colleagues.

With that in mind, we will be updating our policy to require four days per week on site by Sept. 1. I wanted to tell you well in advance so that you have time to make any adjustments to your daily routines. We are going to work hard in the meantime to ensure sites are ready to operate at full capacity. Your local leadership will share site-specific details and seek your input on how to create the best possible on-site experience.

Building a New Intel

I realize this is a lot to take in, but we are playing from behind and we need to rally as a team to put ourselves in the best possible position to win.

This requires us to be laser-focused on developing the best products. We need to delight our customers and earn their trust by delivering the performance, quality and reliability they need to succeed. We must demonstrate predictable execution and ensure on-time delivery. And we need to deliver consistent returns for our shareholders.

There are two ways teams can respond at make-or-break moments like this: They can look at the gap they need to close and give up — or they can look inside themselves and fight like never before.

I made my choice last month when I decided to join you all, and there is no place I would rather be right now. I came on board knowing full well this would be the most challenging job of my career, but also the most motivating and fulfilling — because we have opportunities ahead that most people don’t get in their careers.

I’m talking about the opportunity to fundamentally reinvent an industry icon. To pull off a comeback that will be studied in business schools for generations to come. To create new technologies and deploy them at scale to change the world for the better.

Intel was once widely seen as the world’s most innovative company. There’s no reason we can’t get back there, so long as we drive the changes needed to improve.

It’s going to be hard. It will require painful decisions. But we will make them knowing it’s what we must do to serve our customers better as we build a new Intel for the future – and I have great confidence in the power of our team and our people to make it happen.

Thank you for everything you did in Q1. I look forward to talking more tomorrow during our All Company Meeting.

Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan has announced sweeping restructuring measures including layoffs, management cuts, and an expanded return-to-office mandate as the struggling chipmaker attempts to regain its competitive edge. The changes aim to eliminate ""unnecessary bureaucracy"" and streamline operations to foster innovation, and Tan notes that “this starts by revamping our [company’s] culture.""""I've been surprised to learn that, in recent years, the most important KPI for many managers at Intel has been the size of their teams. Going forward, this will not be the case. I'm a big believer in the philosophy that the best leaders get the most done with the fewest people,"" Tan wrote in a company memo. The company didn’t specify the exact number of job cuts, but with around 108,900 employees at the end of last year, reports suggest up to 20% of the workforce could be impacted.""Many teams are eight or more layers deep, which creates unnecessary bureaucracy that slows us down,"" Tan wrote in a company memo. The new CEO, who has been at the helm for only five weeks, is targeting $1.5 billion in operating expense reductions over the next two years.The flattening will begin in Q2, and Tan says will be continuing into the next few months.These cuts follow a previous round of layoffs just eight months ago when Intel eliminated 15,000 positions.The restructuring prioritizes engineering talent and aims to make engineers ""more productive by removing burdensome workflows and processes that slow down the pace of innovation."" Tan is shifting focus away from measuring management success by team size toward a leaner structure emphasizing execution.The announcement followed Intel's underwhelming first-quarter earnings, highlighting the company's ongoing challenges in adapting to the industry's pivot toward artificial intelligence—a priority CEO Tan emphasized for the future.Intel also recently announced that starting September 1, it will require four in-office days weekly from its employees. This change replaced the company's two-day remote policy to boost collaboration. Tan made this announcement as a part of a strategic roadmap during the company’s Q1 2025 earnings call.","Ceo lip-bu tan: ""we are seen as too slow, too complex and too set in our ways — and we need to change"" tan: we need to get back to our roots and empower our engineers.

Google’s Gemini chatbot gets improved image-creation tools: Here’s what is new,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/googles-gemini-chatbot-gets-improved-image-creation-tools-heres-what-is-new/articleshow/120782220.cms,"Google has announced new enchantments to the image generation capabilities of its chatbot — Gemini. The company has revealed that the upgrades tools are being rolled out on May 1 and promise to offer a more control over the images produced using Google Gemini . “We’re rolling out the ability to easily modify both your AI creations and images you upload from your phone or computer. You can change the background, replace objects, add elements, and more. For example, you can upload a personal photo and prompt Gemini to generate an image of what you’d look like with different hair colours,” Google said in an official blog post.While details on the specifics of the upgrades are still emerging, Google has indicated that the enhancements will allow for more detailed prompts, resulting in more accurate and visually compelling image outputs. Users can likely expect greater control over aspects like artistic style, specific object details, and the overall composition of the generated images.The company has also revealed that Gemini has now got multi-step editing capability which means users can get richer, more contextual responses to their prompts with text and images integrated.“Consistent with all AI-generated images with Gemini, images created or edited with native image generation will include the invisible SynthID digital watermark. We're also currently experimenting with adding a visible watermark on all images generated by Gemini. Native image editing in Gemini will start rolling out gradually today, expanding to more people in over 45 languages and most countries in the coming weeks,” added the company.The rollout will likely occur in phases, with users gaining access to the new features progressively. Google is expected to provide more comprehensive documentation and examples of the upgraded capabilities in the coming days.",Google has announced new enchantments to the image generation capabilities of its chatbot — gemini.

US judge says Apple defied order in App Store case,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/us-judge-says-apple-defied-order-in-app-store-case/articleshow/120781617.cms,"Representative Image(AP)

SAN FRANCISCO: A US judge on Wednesday accused Apple of defying an order to loosen its grip on the App Store payment system to the point that criminal charges could be warranted.US District Court Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers found that Apple ""willfully"" violated an injunction she issued at trial, with the company instead creating new barriers to competition with the App Store and even lying to the court in the process.""That it thought this court would tolerate such insubordination was a gross miscalculation,"" Gonzalez Rogers said in an order allowing Epic Games to enforce the injunction against Apple.""As always, the cover-up made it worse. For this court, there is no second bite at the apple.""Fortnite-maker Epic launched the case in 2021 aiming to break Apple's grip on the App Store, accusing the iPhone maker of acting like a monopoly in its shop for digital goods or services.After a trial, Gonzalez Rogers ruled that Apple's control of the App Store did not amount to a monopoly, but that it must let developers include links to other online venues for buying content or services.The judge also found at the time that the 30 percent commission Apple charges on App Store sales allowed it ""supracompetitive operating margins"" that were anticompetitive, according to the injunction.Apple's response to the trial order included charging a commission on purchases made linking out of its app store, according to the judge.Apple also imposed new barriers and new requirements including ""scare screens"" to dissuade people from buying digital purchases outside of its App Store, the judge concluded.""In the end, Apple sought to maintain a revenue stream worth billions in direct defiance of this court's injunction,"" Gonzalez Rogers said in the ruling.""In stark contrast to Apple's initial in-court testimony, contemporaneous business documents reveal that Apple knew exactly what it was doing and at every turn chose the most anticompetitive option.""An Apple spokesperson told AFP it strongly disagrees with the judge's decision and will appeal to a higher court, but plans to comply.""Apple's 15-30 percent junk fees are now just as dead here in the United States of America as they are in Europe under the Digital Markets Act,"" Epic Games chief executive Tim Sweeney said in a post on X, formerly Twitter.Sweeney's post included a ""peace proposal"" promising to drop current and future litigation on the matter if Apple extends the court's ""Apple-tax-free framework"" worldwide.The judge called on the US attorney's office to investigate whether punitive criminal contempt sanctions against Apple are warranted ""to punish past misconduct and deter future noncompliance.""","Apple accused of defying an order to loosen its grip on the app store payment system.

Bangladesh Currency Crisis: Bangladesh faces currency crisis as central bank halts issuing notes featuring Mujibur Rahman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-faces-currency-crisis-as-central-bank-halts-issuing-notes-featuring-mujibur-rahman/articleshow/120714882.cms,"Approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused

DHAKA: The central bank of Bangladesh has apparently incurred a huge financial loss due to the interim govt’s decision not to issue previously printed notes, with approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remaining unused. The decision aligns with govt’s efforts to diminish Bangabandhu’s presence in public memory.Although bank officials are unwilling to discuss the matter publicly, many, on conditions of anonymity, said the longstanding tradition of obtaining new notes from Bangladesh Bank has been abruptly halted, creating a crisis in the market. On the one hand, the printed money is being wasted without use; on the other hand, customers are suffering as a result, they added.“Notes of various denominations are printed using paper and ink purchased with people’s taxes. Millions of notes with Bangabandhu’s picture are still lying in the vaults of various banks. The Security Printing Corporation does not have the capacity to cancel all the notes at once and print new ones. Therefore, notes with Bangabandhu’s picture cann’t be suddenly cancelled,” Ziauddin Ahmed, former executive director of Bangladesh Bank and former managing director of Security Printing Corporation, told reporters.In this situation, he suggested the printed notes be circulated in the market to alleviate public suffering. “When new design notes come into the market, the old ones should be gradually withdrawn. Generally, notes printed once can be used for a maximum of four to five years,” Ahmed said.According to media reports, Bangladesh Bank is unable to issue new notes to banks in line with demand. The crisis became evident following the country’s political upheaval in Aug last year.Since all forms of currency, including metal coins, feature Mujibur’s image, Bangladesh Bank abruptly stopped issuing new notes early April. As a result, the notes featuring Bangabandhu’s image are not reaching the market. Shops, banks, and citizens are now left with torn and old, dirty notes.According to sources at Bangladesh Bank, the Security Printing Corporation is set to begin printing new design notes next month. In the first phase, new design notes of 20, 50, and 1,000 taka will be printed and subsequently released in the market through banks.","Approximately taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused.

Gold prices slipped by Rs 900 to Rs 98,550 per 10 grams in the national capital on Wednesday, tracking a weaker trend in global markets, according to the All India Sarafa Association. This marks a decline from Tuesday’s close of Rs 99,450 for 99.9% pure gold.Similarly, gold of 99.5% purity fell by Rs 900 to Rs 98,100 per 10 grams, compared to the previous close of Rs 99,000.Despite the drop, festive demand on the occasion of Akshaya Tritiya helped soften the blow. Traditionally seen as an auspicious day to purchase gold, jewellery, and other valuables, the festival sparked a surge in consumer buying.Jewellers expect a 35% jump in gold sales by value this Akshaya Tritiya, driven largely by high prices. Gold was priced at Rs 72,300 per 10 grams during last year’s festival on May 10. However, in terms of quantity, sales are expected to hold steady at around 20 tonnes.Silver, meanwhile, saw a sharp decline of Rs 4,000, slipping to ₹98,000 per kg from Tuesday’s Rs 1,02,000.In global markets, spot gold dropped by $43.35 or 1.31%, trading at $3,273.90 per ounce.Spot silver also fell, quoted 1.83% lower at $32.33 per ounce.Commenting on the international price movement, Kaynat Chainwala, AVP-commodity research at Kotak Securities, said, “Gold extended its decline after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at softening the impact of his auto tariffs and cited progress in trade negotiations with several countries.”Adding to the sentiment, US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick hinted at a breakthrough trade deal, though specifics remain under wraps.Back home, the most-active June contract for gold futures on the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) sank by Rs 1,639, or 1.71%, to trade at Rs 93,953 per 10 grams.Chintan Mehta, CEO of Abans Financial Services, further noted that traders are now turning their attention to upcoming US data, “Traders will closely watch key US macroeconomic releases later this week, including the first estimate of Q1 GDP, Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) inflation data, and April jobs figures.","Gold prices slipped by rs 900 to rs 98,550 per 10 grams in the national capital on wednesday.

The two companies have been partners for nearly three decades, but Tomé made it clear during the firm’s fourth-quarter earnings call that the deal was no longer sustainable on current terms.“Amazon is our largest customer but it’s not our most profitable customer,” she said at the time.“Its margin is very dilutive to the US domestic business.UPS currently employs about 490,000 workers.The company also released its first-quarter financial results on Tuesday, reporting net income of $1.19 billion, or $1.40 per share, for the three months ending 31 March.

Exporters set to get collateral-free loans,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/exporters-set-to-get-collateral-free-loans/articleshow/120777598.cms,"NEW DELHI: The commerce department on Wednesday unveiled the elements of the Export Promotion Mission focused on providing low-cost and collateral-free loans, backing new instruments, supporting opportunities in new markets and boosting export credit to e-commerce, amid concerns that the overall allocation of Rs 2,250 crore was spread too thinly.Top of the agenda is Niryat Rin Vikas or NIRVIK, an interest equalisation scheme targeted at MSMEs and new exporters. The plan is to reset interest rates annually by benchmarking them to rates in other countries that Indian exports are competing with. The decision flows from the realisation within govt that interest rates in India are twice, if not thrice, the level in countries such as China, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, and Thailand.The scheme will come with a specified cap with a negative list of sectors linked to parameters, such as low value addition, raw material or primary products, and items where there is a high probability of misuse, sources told TOI. Exporters will get the benefit upfront with banks getting reimbursed.Govt is also seeking to end the hardship faced by exporters - especially MSMEs and e-commerce - due to banks demanding collaterals. The plan is to provide over 80% of the collateral requirement based on track record through an online evaluation and monitoring mechanism. Exporters will be given a unique ID with fund disbursals on a monthly or quarterly basis under the scheme where a credit guarantee fund will be roped in.The commerce department has also lined up plans to provide easier access to working capital through trade finance instruments, with post-shipment tools, such as factoring, reverse factoring, and vendor financing for small exporters. The overall benefit will come with a ceiling, sources indicated.Similarly, to support emerging opportunities, the govt intends to share up to 90% of the risk of MSMEs, which are looking to venture into ""new, high-risk markets"", with at least 1,000 exporters to be backed in the first year. The Centre intends to use the Trade Assistance Fund to invest in liquid assets allowed under EXIM Bank's investment policy, sources said.A Focused Market Access Initiative is also planned to help exporters tap new opportunities.

NEW DELHI: British rock band Coldplay ’s two-night 'Music of the Spheres' concerts in Ahmedabad created an estimated overall economic impact of Rs 641 crore, with a direct boost of Rs 392 crore to the city’s economy, a report by EY-Parthenon and BookMyShow Live revealed on Wednesday.The concerts, dubbed India’s largest-ever live entertainment spectacle, significantly contributed to local infrastructure, hospitality and cultural tourism.As per news agency PTI, 86 per cent of the attendees had travelled from outside the host city, leading to sharp rises in spending on hotels, transport, dining and retail. The event also contributed Rs 72 crore in GST revenue to the Government of India, demonstrating the fiscal strength of the live entertainment sector.Raghav Anand, partner and leader - digital, media and convergence at EY-Parthenon, said, “As we witness the dynamic growth of India's live entertainment sector, which has surpassed the Rs 12,000 crore mark in 2024 and is projected to grow at a CAGR of around 19 per cent over the next three years, the increasing consumer spends are fuelling this transformative journey.”Prime Minister Narendra Modi had also endorsed the concert economy in his address at the Utkarsh Odisha - Make in Odisha Conclave 2025.Citing Coldplay's performances in Ahmedabad and Mumbai, he said, ""In a country with such a rich heritage in music, dance and storytelling, with such a large pool of youth and a massive consumer base for concerts, there are vast opportunities for the concert economy. In the past decade, both the trend and demand for live events have grown. You must have seen the incredible images from the Coldplay concerts in Mumbai and Ahmedabad in recent days. This is proof of how much scope live concerts have in India.""The Ahmedabad shows also triggered a shift in city branding and created a new template for mega-event infrastructure. The concerts, held at the Narendra Modi Stadium on January 25 and 26, drew more than 2.5 lakh visitors, with over 1.7 lakh coming from outside Gujarat, according to ICC chair Jay Shah.Calling it a “proud moment for India,” Shah said, “Coldplay recorded their biggest concert with 1,34,000 in attendance,” and added that Ahmedabad has now become an epicentre for both sporting and entertainment events.Coldplay, too, acknowledged the scale, writing on X: “Our biggest ever concert.

Record high gold prices hit buyers but ETFs find favour,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/record-high-gold-prices-hit-buyers-but-etfs-find-favour/articleshow/120777496.cms,"HYDERABAD/MUMBAI: The current high prices of gold led to lukewarm demand for the yellow metal on Akshaya Tritiya , despite jewellers offering various schemes like slashing making charges for jewellery and offering gold jewellery as prizes for lucky buyers. The demand for gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs), however, jumped on both the exchanges on Wednesday.Earlier in April, the price of the precious metal rose above the Rs 1 lakh/10gm level, an all-time record. On Wednesday, the price in retail markets around the country hovered between Rs 94,000 and Rs 95,000.Across India, jewellers designed schemes and offers for consumers to soften the blow of steep gold prices and encourage more customers to shop. For example, Malabar Group offered up to 25% off on making charges of gold jewellery and studded jewellery. The company also had an advanced booking facility in place, which allowed customers rate protection by enabling them to book jewellery with a minimum down payment of 10% of the total value and pay the rest based on the booked rate or the prevailing market rate-whichever was lower, said chairman MP Ahammed.Some of the purchases were driven by investment-based needs and the growing desire to hedge against further price rises, he said.According to Darshan Gupta, partner at Mangatrai Jewellers in Hyderabad, the mood among gold buyers was 'lukewarm'. Gupta, who has been trying to woo customers with offers like 'no making charges', said despite all their efforts, the sentiment to buy was lacking. ""Business is expected to be at least 30% lower than last year's Akshaya Tritiya,"" he said.Although business in terms of volume was lower than last year, in terms of value it was almost similar, according to data from the India Bullion & Jewellers Association. Approximately 20 tonnes of gold worth Rs 18,000 crore was sold across the country during the day. In the Mumbai market alone, about 2.5 tonnes of gold worth about Rs 2,350 crore is estimated to have been sold.Rising gold prices also pushed consumers to opt for more pocket-friendly options. PC Chandra Jewellers, for instance, saw more customers queuing up for lightweight gold jewellery and silver. Some diamond pieces, too, found favour with customers.The demand for ETFs showed good traction on the bourses. On the NSE, ETFs worth about Rs 340 crore were traded, while on the BSE the corresponding number was nearly Rs 30 crore.",High prices of gold led to lukewarm demand for the yellow metal on akshaya tritiya.

Costa Coffee sees rising sips grow its India business,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/costa-coffee-sees-rising-sips-grow-its-india-business/articleshow/120777349.cms,"MUMBAI: For British coffee chain Costa Coffee, there's no going slow on India expansion despite an uncertain global macro environment, which has nudged many businesses to review their growth strategies. In India, where many people still love waking up to a hot cup of tea and debates over chai versus coffee continue to rage, parts of the population are moving from tea to coffee.Millennials with higher disposable incomes and Gen Z are driving the market opportunity in India, where the coffee space is growing at 10%-12%, double the rate of global markets, said Philippe Schaillee, CEO at Costa Coffee, which was acquired by The Coca-Cola Company in 2019 in a $4.9 billion deal. India, which is among the company's top 10 markets globally, has the potential to get into the top five markets in five years, Schaillee, who is on a trip to the country, said.""More and more of the (Indian) population is starting to increase the incidence of all the beverages they drink, starting to shift from tea to coffee and increasingly to premium, specialty coffee, which is partially driven by the fact that they see coffee as a product that delivers healthy energy.We have the benefit of being in a category that is just growing rapidly within an overall economic environment that is slowing down,"" Schaillee said in a media round table on Wednesday.The local food and beverages segment saw some slowdown in the second half of last year, but consumption picked up in the March quarter. ""We are definitely not moderating our growth rate in India,"" Schaillee said, adding that the company will continue to open 40-50 new outlets every year as targeted. Costa Coffee, which operates in the specialty coffee space in India through its franchisee partner Devyani International, competes with a mix of global giants like Starbucks, Tim Hortons, and new-age players like Blue Tokai Coffee Roasters and Third Wave Coffee in the market alongside traditional chains such as Cafe Coffee Day.Given the company's low exposure to the US, the tariffs are unlikely to have any material impact on its business; the steep increase in coffee prices has been a bigger headache for players in the space. ""Across the globe, we have passed through green coffee inflation, either directly to consumers or through to our partners and allowed them to decide how they pass on to the consumers,"" Schaillee said.In India, where the firm sources most of its products locally, the strategy will be not to lower the price points, which Schaillee said hampers the experience of quality coffee, but to diversify its range of offerings to include more accessible options. It will also sell more combo packages (with food) that allow brands the scope to offer discounts to consumers.Costa Coffee has historically had more millennials as its customers, given their higher purchasing power compared to Gen Z, and the same is true for India.","The coffee space in india is growing at 10%-12%, double the rate of global markets.
