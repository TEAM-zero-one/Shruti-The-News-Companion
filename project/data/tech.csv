Fat-loss drug Mounjaro now India's No. 2 pharma brand,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/fat-loss-drug-mounjaro-now-indias-no-2-pharma-brand/articleshow/124374071.cms,"Representative image

Augmentin unit value lower than Mounjaro’s

NEW DELHI: Soaring demand for weight-loss therapies has brought Eli Lilly's Mounjaro within striking distance of Indian pharma market's long standing market leader GlaxoSmithKline's Augmentin, an antibiotic.During September, Mounjaro recorded sales of Rs 80 crore, becoming the second-largest brand in the pharma retail market, latest data culled by TOI from market research firm Pharmatrac showed. As against this, Augmentin generated sales of Rs 85 crore during the month.Typically, top-selling medicines in the pharmaceutical market are either Augmentin or anti-diabetic therapy, Mixtard, which generates around Rs 75-80 crore in monthly sales. Launched in March this year, Mounjaro generated a cumulative revenue of Rs 233 crore by September.Industry experts said the introduction of Mounjaro in a pre-filled device, KwikPen, in August has boosted sales.A key reason for the sales is the higher unit value of the drug even though the volumes are lower. Average monthly cost of Mounjaro for a patient starts from Rs 14,000 and goes up to Rs 27,000, depending on the prescription.In contrast, a strip of 10 tablets of Augmentin 625 Duo costs under Rs 200.Sales of Mounjaro's rival, Wegovy, marketed by Novo Nordisk, have, however, plateaued around Rs 9 crore. The company is said to be cutting sales jobs, amid rising competition in the segment. Overall, the organised pharma retail market mopped up total sales of over Rs 20,000 crore in September, a growth of 7.3%, the latest data added. Market expansion was driven by new product introductions and price hikes, with all therapies reporting higher value.Augmentin and Glycomet GP continue to retain their leadership position at the MAT (moving annual total) level. Sept was also the month when the GST reduction from 18% to 5% was rolled out. A slight disturbance was seen in the distribution channel during the month, though there was no disruption at the retail level, experts said.","During september, mounjaro recorded sales of rs 80 crore, becoming the second-largest brand in the pharma retail market.

NEW DELHI: The Punjab government has launched an ambitious 'Roshan Punjab' mission aimed at ensuring round-the-clock affordable electricity across the state within a year.Chief minister Bhagwant Singh Mann said the initiative would put an end to power cuts and provide uninterrupted supply to homes, farms and industries. ""No factory in Punjab will have to pause for electricity. No farmer will be left in the dark,"" Mann said.The state has allocated Rs 5,000 crore for the project, which the government described as the largest-ever investment in Punjab’s power sector. The funds will be used to upgrade transmission lines, repair old infrastructure and build new substations to strengthen supply networks.The government has secured a long-term coal supply from the Pachhwara mine and taken control of the GVK Thermal Plant to ensure stable generation under state supervision.In urban areas, the government has also launched a drive across 13 municipal corporations to remove hanging cables, fix open meter boxes and improve public safety. A new 180-seat call centre in Mohali has been set up to enhance the 1912 helpline for quicker grievance redressal.Mann said the 'Roshan Punjab' mission aims to make Punjab self-reliant in power and lay the foundation for a ""brighter future"" for its people.","The punjab government has launched an ambitious 'roshan punjab' mission aimed at ensuring round-the-clock affordable electricity across the state within a year.

At just 30 years old, Lucy Guo has joined the ranks of billionaire college dropouts like Bill Gates and Mark Zuckerberg, amassing a $1.25 billion net worth, according to Forbes. Guo’s meteoric rise came after her first company, Scale AI, was acquired by Meta in a deal valuing the AI data labeling firm at $29 billion, CNBC reported. Guo, now the founder of Passes, a content creator monetization platform launched in 2022, shared with 'CNBC Make It' that she veered from the traditional path of higher education. After studying computer science and human-computer interaction at Carnegie Mellon University, Guo left the program just two years in, with only one year and eight classes left to graduate. The decision stunned her Chinese immigrant parents.“They sacrificed everything to immigrate from China to America to give their kids a better future,” Guo told CNBC Make It. “For their kids to suddenly let go of their education when they were almost done was like a slap in the face.” “I think they [parents] viewed that as a sign that I didn’t love them, and they weren’t very happy with it, when it was just me making a bet on myself and choosing to optimize for what I thought would be a better future for myself,” she said.Instead of finishing her degree, Guo pursued the Thiel Fellowship, a program by PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel that awards $200,000 to young entrepreneurs to build innovative companies. “I think [my parents] viewed that as a sign that I didn’t love them,” Guo said. “It was just me making a bet on myself and choosing to optimize for what I thought would be a better future.” Despite her unconventional path, Guo sees value in college for its networking opportunities.“One to two years in college is actually just incredibly great because you’re going to make the best friends in college, and you’re going to meet the smartest people,” she told CNBC Make It. “There’s no other scenario where there’s such a high concentration of smart people who are also looking to make friends.”Guo noted that unlike workplaces or social events, where people may already have established circles, college offers a unique environment for building lifelong connections. Her story underscores a growing trend of entrepreneurs prioritizing real-world experience over traditional education, while still recognizing the social benefits of a campus environment.","Lucy guo, 30, is the founder of passes, a content creator monetization platform.

Apple CEO Tim Cook paid a heartfelt tribute to Steve Jobs on his death anniversary. Sharing a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), Cook wrote: “Steve saw the future as a bright and boundless place, lit the path forward, and inspired us to follow. We miss you, my friend.” For those unaware, Jobs died on October 5, 2011 after 8 eight years of battling pancreatic cancer. Tim Cook’s post caught the attention of Tesla CEO Elon Musk who reposted it on his timeline.Steve Jobs co-founded Apple in 1976 alongside Steve Wozniak. During his leadership, Apple launched groundbreaking products like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac, reshaping entire industries and redefining the way people communicate, work, and consume entertainment.Renowned for his focus on design and user experience, Jobs was instrumental in making technology simpler and more accessible. His vision not only revived Apple from the brink of collapse but also propelled it into becoming one of the most valuable and influential companies in the world.When Steve Jobs was battling severe health issues in the late 2000s, Apple’s then–Chief Operating Officer Tim Cook made a deeply personal gesture.Cook offered to donate a part of his liver to Jobs, since both shared the same rare blood type.According to accounts later revealed in Tim Cook’s biography and media reports, the Apple executive underwent extensive medical testing and found that he was indeed a suitable donor. However, Jobs firmly declined the offer.Cook recalled that Jobs became emotional but quickly dismissed the idea, telling him: “I’ll never let you do that. I’ll never do that.” Jobs, who was known for his uncompromising principles and independent spirit, made it clear he would not accept such a sacrifice from a colleague and friend.This episode highlighted both Cook’s deep loyalty to Jobs and the unique bond the two shared during Apple’s most transformative years. While Jobs continued to struggle with his health, he refused to let anyone else bear the risks of a major procedure on his behalf.Jobs eventually underwent a liver transplant in 2009, performed by a medical team in Tennessee, but not with Cook as a donor. He returned to lead Apple after the surgery, but his health continued to decline until his passing in October 2011.","Apple ceo tim cook paid a heartfelt tribute to steve jobs on his death anniversary.

Full text of Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu’s post

Arattai is on the surface a simple product but it has a lot of depth inside.

Let me list the engineering frameworks (all homegrown) that power Arattai.

First is what we call our messaging/AV framework. This has been the ""real time"" workhorse of Zoho for a while and this is what offers you those crisp calls and meetings that connect quickly. It has been perfected for 15 years.

Then we have a distributed framework that allows us to distribute the workload among many servers and databases, and provides fault tolerance, performance monitoring, security and so on. This is the backbone of Zoho and powers a lot of what you see on the surface and also keeps our systems secure. We have been perfecting this for over 20 years now!

We have teams actively working on these frameworks and they provide strong support to the Arattai team.

Our staying power comes from the depth of all the R&D we do. Recently I have moved full time to R&D and you will see many more innovations from us.





Zoho founder and former CEO Sridhar Vembu recently said that being a dedicated engineer is like being a Rishi. In a post on X (formerly Twitter), Vembu highlighted that the company’s recently launched messaging platform – Arattai may see a “simple product” on the surface, but “has a lot of depth inside”. Praising the Arattai team, he wrote “all of you have worked hard for over 5 years without expecting that the product would ever take off.” “Allow neither praise nor criticism nor fame to distract you, resolutely stay the course,” Vembu added.In the post, he also shed light on the engineering framework that power Arattai.

“the more connected and accessible you are, the less productive you are.”





Telegram CEO Pavel Durov begins his day without checking his phone. This is because he views the device as a distraction that can prevent people from forming their own ideas. On a recent episode of the Lex Fridman podcast, Durov said he tries to limit his phone usage, explaining that he doesn't want other people telling him what to think. Durov's discipline regarding his phone is part of a broader routine aimed at maximising mental clarity. He revealed that he allocates 11 to 12 hours for sleep, often spending part of that time with his mind racing, as he finds that brilliant ideas come to him during these extended rest periods. Fridman, the podcast host, also noted that he spent two weeks with Durov and never saw him use his phone for social media as most people do.In the podcast, Durov said:However, Durov acknowledged the need to stay connected while maintaining balance, as his career has been built on apps that promote smartphone use. He noted:Durov has also been vocal about his views on technology and data privacy.In August, he said he’d “rather die” than give third parties access to Telegram messages.He has become a central figure in the ongoing tension between social media platforms and governments. In August 2024, he was arrested by French authorities over allegations that Telegram enabled illegal activity, claims that he has firmly denied.

Three scientists win Physics Nobel for work that paved way for cellphones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/three-scientists-win-physics-nobel-for-work-that-paved-way-for-cellphones/articleshow/124375320.cms,"File photo: US scientists John Clarke, Michel Devoret and John Martinis





STOCKHOLM: US-based scientists John Clarke, Michel Devoret and John Martinis won the 2025 Nobel Prize in Physics for ""experiments that revealed quantum physics in action"", paving the way for the development of the next generation of digital technologies. ""There is no advanced technology today that does not rely on quantum mechanics,"" Olle Eriksson, chair of the Nobel Committee for Physics, said during the announcement of the award. The laureates' discoveries, he added, paved the way for technologies such as the cellphone, cameras and fiber optic cables.It also helped lay the groundwork for current attempts to build a quantum computer, a device that could compute and process information at speeds that would not be possible with classical computers. The three scientists were recognised for a series of experiments conducted in 1984 and 1985. They proved the existence of two quantum phenomena on a system visible to the human eye.The principles of quantum mechanics describe the strange properties and behaviours of single or small collections of elementary particles. In one such behaviour, called quantum tunnelling, a particle can move through a barrier even if it does not have enough energy to do so.Another property of subatomic particles is that they can emit and absorb energy only in fixed, discrete amounts. This is known as the quantization of energy. With a large number of particles, however, these tiny quantum effects generally become insignificant.The laureates of this year's physics prize showed, for the first time, that quantum tunneling is observable in a system they called macroscopic because it was ""big enough to get one's grubby fingers on,"" according to their paper describing the discovery. They also showed that the energy of this system was quantised, or existed at fixed levels.They made these discoveries by studying a chip with a circuit that was superconducting, meaning it was capable of conducting current with no electrical resistance. As a result, the current was ""trapped"" in a state of flow without any voltage, because it did not have enough energy to escape, according to a summary posted by the Nobel committee, as if behind a barrier that it is unable to cross. The researchers observed the current go from a state of zero voltage to one of non-zero voltage, an observation of quantum tunneling. They also observed that the system only absorbed light of certain frequencies, suggesting that its energy was 'quantised'. The three laureates will share a prize of 11 million Swedish kroner (Rs 10.4 crore).British-born Clarke is a professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Devoret, who was born in France, is a professor at Yale University and the University of California, Santa Barbara, also in the US, where Martinis is also a professor.Two of the three have links with Google . Martinis headed Google's Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab until 2020. Devoret, besides his professorship, is also the chief scientist of Google Quantum AI. It is the second straight year that a Nobel has been won by scientists with Google ties. The 2024 chemistry prize was awarded to Demis Hassabis and John Jumper at Google DeepMind while Geoffrey Hinton, who worked for Google for over a decade, won for physics the same year.","Us-based scientists john clarke, michel devoret and john martinis won the 2025 nobel prize in physics.

Eiffel Tower was almost demolished! Here’s how it was saved and survived over a century,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/eiffel-tower-was-almost-demolished-heres-how-it-was-saved-and-survived-over-a-century/articleshow/124375034.cms,"Image: Pexels

Eiffel Tower’s controversial beginnings

Engineering marvel vs. artistic criticism

Science secures survival





When the Eiffel Tower was first erected for the 1889 World’s Fair in Paris, it faced harsh criticism. Prominent artists and writers labeled it “monstrous” and “useless,” and its creator, Gustave Eiffel, initially received only a 20-year permit to occupy the land. Despite its groundbreaking engineering, many Parisians disliked the structure, fearing it would scar the city’s beauty. Yet Eiffel found a clever way to secure its survival: he transformed the tower into a hub for scientific research and communication. By installing a station at its peak for experiments and radio transmissions, he proved its practical value and ensured it would remain standing long after the World’s Fair ended.The idea for the Eiffel Tower originated in 1884 when engineers Emile Nouguier and Maurice Koechlin, working for Eiffel, envisioned an iron lattice tower. They wanted to build a vertical spectacle that would demonstrate the possibilities of modern iron construction and celebrate France’s industrial and technological achievements. After securing a patent and winning a competition for the 1889 World’s Fair centerpiece, construction began in January 1887 and concluded in March 1889.Despite its rapid completion, the project faced public backlash. A letter signed by writers, artists, and architects—including Guy de Maupassant and Charles Garnier—called the tower a “tragic street lamp” and “Tower of Babel,” reflecting fears that it would ruin Paris’ aesthetic charm.The tower’s design sparked debate over whether it represented true architecture or pure engineering. Critics objected to its exposed iron frame and massive base, while Eiffel argued that elegance could exist within engineering. Initially adorned with decorative Gothic elements, many were later removed, leaving the stark lattice structure. Over time, public opinion shifted as visitors marveled at unprecedented panoramic views of Paris from its heights, demonstrating the tower’s unique attraction.Eiffel ensured the tower’s long-term survival by dedicating its top to scientific experimentation. Atmospheric studies and other research took place at the summit, giving the tower functional value beyond mere aesthetics. In 1898, it became a radio transmission site, and by 1908, experiments transmitted signals over thousands of miles. These scientific uses proved crucial in gaining a 70-year extension on Eiffel’s permit, effectively saving the structure from demolition.","The eiffel tower was first erected for the 1889 world’s fair in paris. Despite its groundbreaking engineering, many parisians disliked the structure, fearing it would scar the city's beauty.

Concentration of AI capabilities poses systemic risks: NPCI chairman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/concentration-of-ai-capabilities-poses-systemic-risks-npci-chairman/articleshow/124375101.cms,"



MUMBAI: NPCI chairman Ajay Kumar Choudhary warned that the growing concentration of artificial intelligence infrastructure in the hands of a few global players poses systemic risks to financial stability. Speaking at the Global FinTech Fest 2025 in Mumbai, he said, “One company produces about 90% of advanced processors, three firms control most global cloud capacity, and only a handful dominate foundation models.” Such dependencies, he said, threaten financial resilience, economic sovereignty, and national security.He cautioned that unchecked AI adoption could amplify financial cycles and systemic vulnerabilities, echoing concerns raised by global institutions such as the Basel Committee, IMF, and BIS. “This is why responsible AI is not a slogan. It is the only way forward,” he said, urging the industry to diversify dependencies, strengthen data governance, and build resilience.“The true test of AI will be whether it strengthens stability rather than weakens it,” he said. “If we apply it with vision, discipline, and responsibility, it can widen access, build resilience, and make growth more inclusive,” he said Choudhary noted that AI has moved from the margins to the mainstream, reshaping how financial services are designed and delivered.Speaking on “AI’s Promise and Peril: Building Responsible Intelligence for Inclusive Finance,” he said the technology offers vast opportunities but also demands prudent governance and international collaboration. “The industry is no longer debating if AI will matter; it is preparing for how far and how fast it will take us. The real question is whether we harness this power carefully,” he said.Global banks could see productivity gains of USD 200–340 billion annually through the use of generative and agentic AI technologies, he said. Investments in AI across banking, insurance, capital markets, and payments are projected to reach USD 100 billion by 2027, with 78% of financial firms already using it in at least one function, up from 55% in 2023.He cited India’s progress in digital payments as an example of inclusive innovation, noting that UPI now processes over 20 billion transactions a month. NPCI initiatives such as UPI Lite for low-bandwidth areas, UPI 123Pay for feature phones, and UPI for Her aimed at women entrepreneurs, demonstrate the potential for AI to drive access and inclusion.NPCI is piloting federated AI models for fraud prevention without sharing sensitive data and deploying real-time mule account detection tools to ensure payment integrity. NPCI International, he said, is working to support sovereign, interoperable real-time payment systems and expand UPI and RuPay globally.Choudhary also announced new payment innovations, including Bharat Connect’s Internet and Mobile Banking Platform to standardise merchant payments across digital channels. NPCI Tech Solutions will serve as a hub for deep-tech experimentation and innovation.","Npci chairman ajay kumar choudhary warned that unchecked ai adoption could amplify financial cycles and systemic vulnerabilities.

NEW DELHI: A World Bank report released on Tuesday said there has been a 20% decline in job listings for the most exposed and most substitutable white-collar occupations in South Asia due to generative AI, which has also provided a 30% wage premium for required skills.Between January 2023 and March 2025, job-posting data indicated that the share of AI-related postings more than doubled - to 6.5% of all listings from 2.9% - and demand for AI skills grew 75% faster than overall non-AI listings, the South Asia Development Update said. It estimated that 5.8% of the listings in India required AI skills, with Bengaluru and Hyderabad leading, followed by Pune and Chennai.At around 20%, India's labour market is less exposed to AI, given the large agricultural workforces with lower average skill levels, in general it is the entry level jobs that appear to be more at risk. So, it is urban jobs, which face greater exposure and males, who are more exposed than females, whose participation level in the labour force remains low.""Even within a generally low-exposure labour market, the distribution of exposure across sectors follows job quality. White-collar professionals in business services, commerce, and public administration face the highest AI exposure, whereas manual labour roles in agriculture, manufacturing, and basic services remain the least exposed,"" said the report.It added that within white-collar jobs, most professional and managerial roles remained AI-complementary, while some clerical, technical, and sales positions showed lower complementarity. The exposure level is also higher among mid-sized firms.The report said that IT, finance and professional services may be among sectors, which can see high productivity gains due to AI adoption.The report said that benefiting from AI will require appropriate digital and energy infrastructure, along with skills and a robust policy framework.It suggested upskilling and reskilling apart from upgrading the quality of human capital. Besides, the multilateral agency said: ""Unlocking private capital for investment could support growth and job creation.""","A world bank report released on tuesday said there has been a 20% decline in job listings for the most exposed and most substitutable white-collar occupations in south asia.

BCG proposes six-pronged approach to deliver AI-powered solutions at $2 a month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bcg-proposes-six-pronged-approach-to-deliver-ai-powered-solutions-at-2-a-month/articleshow/124375038.cms,"Empowering Finance for a Better World Powered by AI

Convergence: Human + AI for the Next Era of Finance





MUMBAI: AI-powered financial solutions in India can be delivered for Rs 150–250 per month and could fall to Rs 50 within the next three to four years as scale expands and inference costs drop, according to a report by the Boston Consulting Group (BCG). The report said Indian fintechs have grown 35% over the past two years and are on track to reach $190 billion by 2030.Released on the opening day of the Global Fintech Fest (GFF) 2025 in Mumbai, themed, BCG’s flagship report,, outlines how India can build a globally competitive AI ecosystem. The launch comes amid a surge in AI investment, with $1.3 trillion committed worldwide over the past five years, roughly four times total fintech funding. Adoption has been rapid, with around 40% of working-age people using generative AI tools within two years—a milestone the internet reached in five.The report said AI’s impact would not be limited to large corporations. It could drive “convenience in daily life” and “convenience in business operations” through population-scale applications. Conceptual platforms such as JanArth.AI and VyaparSaathi.AI could enable personal finance management for households and function as virtual CFOs for small enterprises.Yashraj Erande, global head of fintech and India head of financial institutions at BCG, said, “India is at a defining moment. On one hand, Indian fintechs have demonstrated 35% growth in the last two years and are on track to achieve $190 billion by 2030. On the other, AI is rewriting the rules of competitiveness globally and has reignited innovation as a top CXO priority for Indian fintechs.” He said India is “uniquely positioned on three fronts: as the world’s largest AI consumer market, a global AI use-case playground, and a leading execution hub exporting technology solutions worldwide. ” He added that India has both scale and execution strength, with the Govt supporting the sector through the IndiaAI Mission.According to the report, India’s ability to capture the AI opportunity will depend on execution across six dimensions of the AI stack. The first is infrastructure, where the country faces what the report calls a “2–20 conundrum.” India generates about 20% of the world’s data but has only 2% of global data center capacity. It should target at least 8% or 17 GW by 2030 through large-scale real estate and sustainable energy investments. A two-speed strategy is proposed for computing—deepening partnerships with global chipmakers while developing indigenous GPU design.The second element is data. India must expand AIKosh, its national dataset platform, to build an ethical and diverse data commons suitable for domestic and emerging market needs. The third is model development, with the report urging the creation of domain-specific, population-scale AI for Bharat and the Global South in healthcare, agriculture, education, and financial inclusion. These should include multilingual and multimodal capabilities to serve Tier-2 and rural users.The fourth focus is capital. India needs more than Rs 10 lakh crore in patient capital to fund AI innovation. The report said enabling M&A exits and unlocking domestic pools such as insurance and pension funds, alongside private equity, venture capital, and family offices, will be essential. Policy should encourage long-term investment by high-net-worth individuals and institutional investors.The fifth pillar is talent. India must aim to become a global “AI brain” by improving research capacity, retaining skilled professionals, and expanding AI training programs. Finally, the report said India could capture a significant share of global AI software and services revenue, projected at $100–120 billion by 2028—about half of its current IT services market.The report offers guidance for financial institutions, regulators, and policymakers on embedding responsible AI practices. It recommends that banks and insurers focus on measurable business outcomes, increase R&D spending, and redesign workflows using AI. Regulators such as the RBI, it said, should promote responsible AI through principles of fairness, transparency, and ethics, and enable centralized fraud surveillance where all regulated entities share identified fraud risk cases.For financial inclusion, the report proposed low-cost, vernacular, mobile-first applications that can automatically detect scheme eligibility, prompt savings, and protect against phishing. For MSMEs, AI-driven CFO tools could automate bookkeeping, compliance, and credit access. In credit delivery, it said the Unified Lending Interface, combined with AI-powered underwriting, can cut turnaround times by automating data sourcing and risk flagging for underwriters.According to the report, India’s multi-pronged AI strategy, if executed across infrastructure, data, models, capital, talent, and applications, could position it as a global leader in the next era of finance.","Report: indian fintechs have grown 35% over the past two years and are on track to reach $190 billion by 2030.

MUMBAI: RBI deputy governor T Rabi Sankar on Tuesday urged safeguards in financial AI systems, stressing that oversight must always rest with humans. Speaking at the Global Fintech Fest here, he warned that the growing use of artificial intelligence in finance carries risks of bias, opacity, and weakened accountability.""Bias in training data can entrench inequalities, and opaque models make explainability difficult, weakening regulatory scrutiny,"" he said.He also highlighted ethical concerns, including misuse of behavioural data, privacy breaches, manipulative cross-selling, and social risks such as job displacement, while noting that excessive automation could heighten volatility and blur legal responsibility for errors.Sankar launched three digital payment products at the event: UPI multi-signatory, small-value transactions using wearable glasses via UPI lite, and forex on Bharat Connect. UPI multi-signatory enables approval-based payments from joint accounts, improving efficiency and transparency.The wearable integration allows small-value, voice-authenticated payments through smart glasses, easing seamless digital transactions.Forex on Bharat Connect links Clearing Corporation of India Limited's FX retail with Bharat BillPay, allowing users to buy US dollars at real-time rates through bank apps.Sankar elaborated on RBI's plans to strengthen protection against frauds and enhance oversight through technological solutions. Central to this is the forthcoming digital payments intelligence platform.

Poll Do you believe the Taliban's suspension of internet services is justified? Yes, to prevent immorality No, it's an infringement on rights





The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service, following weeks of cutting fibre-optic internet connections in different provinces.According to internet watchdog NetBlocks, the country is experiencing a ""total internet blackout."" The group reported that the disruption appears to be the most extensive and coordinated shutdown of telecom services in Afghanistan since the Taliban regained control in 2021. The blackout has raised concerns about the return of earlier restrictions from the Taliban’s first rule, when they banned television, satellite dishes, and other forms of mass communication in what they described as a campaign against immorality.The government had already started reducing high-speed internet access in some provinces earlier this month. Officials said this was done to prevent ""vice,"" following orders from the Taliban’s supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada.By Monday night, mobile phone signals and internet access steadily weakened across the country until overall connectivity dropped to less than one percent of normal activity, NetBlocks reported.It is the first time since the Taliban seized power in 2021, after years of insurgency, that communication services across the nation have been cut off. Since then, the group has enforced a strict version of Islamic law and imposed several restrictions.Residents expressed concern over the impact of the blackout on daily life and business. ""We are blind without phones and internet,"" Najibullah, a 42-year-old shopkeeper in Kabul, was quoted as saying by the news agency AFP. ""All our business relies on mobiles. The deliveries are with mobiles. It's like a holiday, everyone is at home. The market is totally frozen.""The Taliban have not issued an official explanation for the nationwide suspension. A government official, however, said that “eight to nine thousand telecommunications pillars” would be switched off and added that the blackout would remain in place “until further notice.”Just last year, in 2024, the Taliban had described Afghanistan’s fibre-optic project as a key priority. The 9,350-kilometre (5,800-mile) network, developed mostly during governments backed by the United States, was promoted as a way to connect the country with the outside world and support economic recovery.Earlier in September, Taliban representatives warned that they planned to cut off internet access nationwide “to prevent immoral activities.” They did not specify what was considered immoral under their order.Haji Zaid, the governor of Balkh province, said in a statement that ""an alternative system will be established within the country for essential needs."" He did not clarify what this system would include or how it would function.","The taliban government in afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service.

Defence, investment, and the new space race





Europe’s space ambitions are at a critical juncture, according to Bernard Liautaud, managing partner at Balderton Capital. Speaking at the Italian Tech Week event, Liautaud warned that the continent risks falling behind in the rapidly expanding space and defence sectors due to an excessive dependence on American companies, particularly Elon Musk’s SpaceX . While European start-ups have made notable advances in satellite technology and defence innovation, SpaceX’s dominance in launch services and communications infrastructure poses a “huge risk” to Europe’s technological sovereignty and national security. Liautaud urged governments to accelerate investment in domestic capabilities and nurture home-grown innovation to strengthen Europe’s position in the global space race.Liautaud cautioned that European nations remain overly reliant on American firms for satellite launches and space-based infrastructure. SpaceX, now valued at around $400 billion (£315 billion), dominates both the commercial launch market and the communications satellite sector, a dependency he described as strategically dangerous. “We need to be more self-sufficient,” he said, underlining that control over space technology is becoming a decisive factor in military and economic strength. Despite US dominance, Europe’s start-up ecosystem is showing promising growth. Liautaud argued that supporting such enterprises is essential for Europe’s strategic autonomy, calling start-ups “a key ingredient” in the effort to achieve technological sovereignty.European investment in defence and aerospace technology has surged since Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, driving the emergence of new firms specialising in drones, battlefield software, and orbital infrastructure. Liautaud stressed that space-based capabilities are now integral to both military supremacy and global competitiveness. By cultivating independent launch systems and communications networks, Europe can reduce its exposure to foreign political and commercial pressures.Industry leaders share Liautaud’s concern. Hélène Huby, founder of The Exploration Company and a former Airbus executive, described Europe as “quite weak right now regarding space-based infrastructure.” With US giants like SpaceX and Blue Origin racing ahead, the window for Europe to build independent capabilities is rapidly closing. “We must act now,” Liautaud urged, framing Europe’s challenge not merely as a question of innovation but of strategic survival in the new era of space competition.","Europe’s space ambitions are at a critical juncture, according to bernard liautaud, managing partner at balderton capital.

What is K Visa





China’s new K visa for foreign professionals is facing criticism on social media even before it comes into effect. Netizens have raised concerns over its timing, fairness, and potential impact on domestic employment.Originally scheduled to launch on October 1, the visa’s rollout has been delayed as Chinese embassies abroad remain closed until October 8 for National Day and Mid-Autumn Festival holidays.The K visa, described as China’s version of the H-1B, was announced in August but gained attention only after US president Donald Trump highlighted the USD 1,00,000 fee for H-1B visas, which mainly benefit Indian professionals.Critics pointed to China’s high unemployment, estimated at around 19 per cent over the past two years, and the pressure of 12 million new graduates entering the job market each year. Many questioned the policy favouring foreign STEM graduates over domestic talent.Concerns were also raised over the lack of employer sponsorship, which could increase the risk of fraud and low-quality applications.One Weibo user wrote: “It is already hard to verify domestic degrees. With the K visa, agencies may exploit the system to help foreigners get visas. How will each application be properly vetted?”Others asked why foreign bachelor’s degree holders are treated as ‘tech talent’ while young Chinese graduates struggle to find jobs and often pursue master’s degrees.Some suggested that a master’s degree should be the minimum requirement for K visa applicants.The newly introduced K visa, announced in August, aims to attract young international STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) graduates by offering entry, residency and work authorisation without requiring any prior work offer.According to Xinhua, the K visa will offer longer validity, multiple entries, and extended stay periods compared to China’s 12 existing visa types. Holders can engage in education, culture, science and technology exchanges, as well as entrepreneurial and business activities.","The k visa, described as china’s version of the h-1b, was announced in august.
