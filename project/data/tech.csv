Despite global challenges, commerce & industry minister

Piyush Goyal

expects exports to scale a new high this year, aided by FTAs. While remaining upbeat on growth, he tells

Sidhartha

that investment is flowing into several sectors. He is pushing for a review of FTAs with

Asean

and Japan and is cautious on China. Excerpts:

How much export growth is expected this year given the global uncertainty?

How much help will come from FTAs?

The Modi govt opted out of RCEP. In hindsight, was it a sensible thing to do since many experts still argue that India should have joined it?

The Asean FTA is under review. Are you satisfied with the pace or is there a sense of frustration?

Your recent comments on the Asean agreement stirred a controversy. Do you see Chinese goods and investments getting routed through some of the countries that are part of the bloc?

Does the focus on China+1 remain in the US?

Are there opportunities for India?

Despite the focus on reducing imports from China, the trade deficit is near $100 billion. What is being done to check that?

Is there a reluctance to allow Indian goods in China?

Are the conditions conducive to lifting some of the checks?

There are indications of a slowdown in the first quarter. As the minister in-charge of industry, what will be your strategy to accelerate growth in the industrial sector?

Weak capex by the private sector is a major concern. When do you see an improvement in investments?

While gross FDI inflows have grown, there was an increase in remittances and outward FDI last year. How will you step up overall FDI flows?

What changes are you planning on SEZ regulations?

Quality control orders have been a focus. What is the rationale and benefit when a section of industry is objecting to them?

How is the progress on industrial corridors and when will you be ready with the plan for 100 industrial parks?

In the last 11 years of Modi govt, India has navigated uncertainty and volatility quite well. Total exports soared to a record $825 billion in 2024-25, growing over 6%, and sustaining a robust 5.8% CAGR over the past decade. We have seen a remarkable 20% CAGR during the past decade in electronics, and traditional sectors such as engineering and pharmaceuticals have done well. From 2019-20 to 2024-25, goods exports have seen a CAGR of 6.9%, despite the Covid period. From 2019 to 2023, because country-wise data is available up to 2023, commercial services exports registered a CAGR of 12%. Going forward, we may be able to maintain 5-6% growth in goods, especially non-petroleum exports, while services may grow 9-10%. If we can achieve that we are looking at crossing $870 billion in the current year, despite the global problems. Our focus is more and more on value-added and labour-intensive goods and services exports.India has deepened its footprint with FTAs with the UAE, Australia, EFTA and the UK, reshaping our trade dynamics. FTAs do make an impact. With the UAE, services exports have almost doubled in the last four-five years.In Australia, it has nearly tripled. On the goods side too we have grown very well, in Australia’s case at 25%, we have crossed $8 billion, while we were tottering at $3 billion earlier. The same is not true of the ones signed during UPA. Services export to Japan is slowing down. We did not get very wide coverage in areas of interest for India. It’s a sad situation and I hope that our efforts for a review will bear fruit. Japan has not agreed to it and a South Korea review is underway. Now, we sign FTAs after extensive stakeholder consultation and for the Modi govt, national interest is paramount.Before the decision, we held 200 consultations with stakeholders on RCEP and the benefits of joining it, only three suggested we should join. PM Modi showed decisive leadership and sensitivities for our fishermen, farmers, industry and entrepreneurs. He recognised that it was nothing but FTA between India and China because we had agreements with the others. We have signed ECTA with Australia and we should be able to finalise an agreement with New Zealand in the next few months. Just this week at a meeting with exporters, the issue came up and not one of them suggested that we should join.We can do much better and I am hopeful that both Korea and Asean will recognise the asymmetries in the FTAs signed 15 years ago and will make them more contemporary, fair, balanced and equitable.When the US announced its agreement with Vietnam, it focused on transshipment of goods from other countries. Every day we get cases of sub-standard goods coming in, predatory pricing being deployed for exports and to kill Indian industry. We are working on strengthening Make in India, supporting Indian industry wherever it is hurt by predaTOI tory pricing and focusing on Quality Control Orders.It appears to be working on a two-pronged strategy. While recognising that it cannot decouple completely from China, it is also working on strengthening the supply chain.Clearly, India is a much sought after destination for investments, there are collaborations for technology. In the maritime sector, India is recognised as a shipbuilding destination and govt is also coming up with measures to support it. Semiconductors is a success story of the Modi govt. We have seen significant increase in domestic value addition in the sectors where we offered PLI.During the 10 years of UPA, India’s trade deficit with China grew nearly 25 times, but has expanded 1.75 times between 2014-15 and 202324. We have managed to bring some reasonable controls. Electrical equipment, machinery, organic chemicals and plastics are our major imports. Between 2019-20 and 2023-24, there has been an increase in import of these items from China, but there is also a corresponding increase in exports, showing that several items imported from China are raw material, inputs or capital goods used for making finished products in India.There are several non-tariff barriers, including language and procedural delays. Many industries just don’t buy from India even when our products are competitive. Getting more market access is an area in which we are working with China through our embassy.Periodically, China has erected restrictions, whether it is export of rare earth magnets, fertilizer or tunnel boring machines, and recently recalled engineers. Yet, there are demands from Indian industry to lift some of the checks on investment from China, on visas and on apps.Given that there is now engagement with China at the ministerial level, if China is willing to engage on fair terms on trade, India will be willing to talks and see how we can work towards a more mutually beneficial and a fair trading system.Time will tell.We are already seeing an uptick and rural demand has shown significant improvement. You may see a jump in growth in the second half of the year. I see no difficulty in closing the year with RBI’s 6.5% growth which will make us the fastest growing economy.It varies across sectors. There is a lot of interest in investments in sectors that have domestic demand and there is import substitution, such as steel. There are plans to invest Rs 20 lakh crore in 10 years; cement is an ever-green sector as demand and production grow every year. Auto parts, sanitaryware are seeing large investments and there is confidence that Indian companies can compete with anyone. There are some focus areas like white goods, where demand is growing very fast on the back of tax cuts, growing income levels and the finance minister also spoke of GST reduction recently. Auto sector is growing rapidly and our efforts in electronics are showing results. Some of the investment going into GCCs may not be fully captured.With the outflow of investment, India is also building an asset base and its own presence in different sectors across the world, which in the long run will be our strength.There are certain suggestions that will help SEZ units increase their capacity utilisation and help meet the demand that is currently being serviced by some of the FTA countries. We are working with the requisite departments, and we should be able to come up with the changes by the end of the year.We are emphasising on QCOs to implement the PM’s vision of zero defect-zero effect manufacturing. Technical regulations have been strengthened to promote a strong quality ecosystem in India, enhance product safety for consumers, prevent the import of substandard goods, protect the environment and attract investment. It acts as a nudge to produce quality products in India.In Dholera, Shendra-Bidkin, Greater Noida and Vikram Udyogpuri, over 4,200 acres have been allotted and 76% of the developed industrial land is now under committed use. Each city is emerging as an industrial powerhouse: Dholera has emerged as the future semicon city of India, ShendraBidkin in Maharashtra is evolving into an automotive and EV hub. Of the 12 new projects approved by the govt last Aug, tenders have been floated and our target is to get the ground activity started by OctNov. As for the industrial parks, the blueprint is at an advanced stage. They are proposed to be developed and implemented through independent special purpose vehicles in collaboration between the Centre, states and wherever applicable, private players. There will be a single window system for approvals and plug-and-play infrastructure will be maintained.","Commerce & industry minister piyush goyal expects exports to scale a new high this year, aided by ftas.

UltraSound & fabric study

In the hushed corridors of the International Space Station (ISS), where human voices float as weightlessly as the bodies that carry them, Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla and his Ax-4 crewmates are helping decode the science of sound in space — quite literally.The Ax-4 crew recently lent their voices to the “Voice in Space” study, a pioneering experiment investigating how microgravity alters human speech. Without gravity’s usual pull on the lungs, diaphragm, and vocal tract, even subtle changes in vocal fold vibration or tone can occur.Using electroglottography — a non-invasive technique used to measure vocal fold contact during voice production — sensors and a series of scripted vocal tasks, researchers are capturing these shifts to understand how spaceflight affects speech patterns and cognition.The aim? To train artificial intelligence systems that can one day monitor astronaut health in real time — and perhaps even enhance voice-based AI technologies back on Earth. This study blends physiology, acoustics, and machine learning.“This experiment seeks to determine whether the influenced voice pattern and listening capabilities of the participant might be able to be detected by an AI algorithm. Vocal characteristics of an ISS crew member can change in a zero-gravity, and after undergoing cognitive function changes.Measurements of vocal fold vibration provide a quantitative indication of vocal fold function,” as per Axiom Space.Scripted voice audio recordings — reading, singing, vowel enunciation, audio pitch matching— allow for tonal analysis, Axiom said, adding that these data allow the investigator to test and analyse vocal performance and voice pattern changes in space and then evaluate how space journey influences the human voice.But sound wasn’t the only thing on the crew’s mind. Alongside the voice study, they completed multiple sessions of the “Cerebral Hemodynamics” investigation — an exploration into how blood flows through the brain in a zero-gravity environment.Without gravity pulling fluids downward, astronauts often experience a fluid shift towards the head. By using ultrasound to monitor these changes, scientists hope to develop better diagnostic tools for cardiovascular and neurological conditions — tools that could serve both astronauts and patients on Earth suffering from stroke, dizziness, or fainting.Also on the roster of the Ax-4 crew is the “Suit Fabric Study”, a technology demonstration examining how clothing behaves in space. This isn’t just about comfort — it's about performance. The crew wore sensor-equipped garments during exercise to observe how heat and moisture are managed when convection is no longer at play.“The findings could inform the design of next-generation space suits — and inspire innovations in thermal wear on Earth, from sports gear to medical textiles,” Axiom added.",Indian astronaut shubhanshu shukla and his crewmates are helping decode the science of sound in space.

"Tejas-Mk-1A roll out from Nashik this month, Astra firing likely in Aug: HAL CMD",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tejas-mk-1a-roll-out-from-nashik-this-month-astra-firing-likely-in-aug-hal-cmd/articleshow/122234157.cms,"HAL CMD DK Sunil

BENGALURU: Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) will roll out the first LCA Tejas Mk1A from its new Nashik production line by the end of July, with integration and test firing of the Astra air-to-air missile scheduled for early August, HAL CMD DK Sunil told TOI in an interview.The rollout from Nashik marks a key milestone in HAL’s efforts to scale up Tejas production, even as the programme works through engine supply constraints and indigenous radar integration delays. “The first aircraft from Nashik is already in final assembly and under testing. We expect the rollout in a month,” Sunil said, adding that while the current year may see three to four aircraft from Nashik, the plant has been built to support an annual output of eight.At present, HAL is operating two production lines in Bengaluru and has initiated the third at Nashik. A parallel private-sector supply chain — comprising VEM Technologies (centre fuselage), Alpha (rear fuselage), and L&T (wings) — is expected to contribute towards an additional six aircraft a year, eventually raising the overall production capacity to 30 aircraft annually.He said that despite engine supply delays from GE, HAL is pressing ahead with deliveries.“We have already built six aircraft which are ready and flying,” Sunil said. HAL expects to produce 12 aircraft this year, using available GE engines in rotation to carry out critical test flights. GE has assured delivery of 12 engines this year, with the second engine expected this month after only one had arrived by April.Integration of Astra missile, developed by DRDO, is scheduled for early August. “We need to have some of the other issues sorted out like the firing of the missile, the Astra missile, which we plan to do in August, early August,” he said.On radar integration, HAL faced criticism for opting to continue with the imported ELTA radar from Israel for all Tejas Mk1A fighters under the current contract, instead of switching midstream — from the 41st aircraft — to the indigenous Uttam AESA radar.Sunil clarified that 40 ELTA radars were contracted initially, with a plan to introduce Uttam from the 41st aircraft onwards. However, delays in certification of both the Uttam radar and associated electronic warfare (EW) suite, also being developed by DRDO, forced HAL’s hand.He noted that over the last three years, HAL has held several meetings with senior officials from DRDO and IAF, but the certification timelines have repeatedly slipped. “As a manufacturer, when we’re under pressure for not delivering, the risk becomes ours. If we wait and the systems still aren’t certified, we are left with no aircraft to hand over.”“There was a clear directive from DRDO headquarters in Feb 2024 that if certification is not achieved by year-end, HAL may proceed. That meeting and directive are on record. We waited until March this year, but when progress still hadn’t been made, we moved forward.”In response to persistent concerns from the Indian Air Force about unmet aircraft staff qualitative requirements (ASQRs), Sunil attributed the delays to legacy issues and dependency on various partners including ADA and DRDO. “Parallel efforts are underway to close these issues across multiple aircraft. It’s not that there’s no effort — it’s just that the closure needs to be more structured,” he said.HAL aims to deliver all 12 Tejas Mk1As scheduled for this year, with the full production ecosystem — including public and private lines — expected to reach a steady state of 30 aircraft annually from 2026-27.","Hal aims to deliver all 12 tejas mk1as scheduled for this year, with the full production ecosystem — including public and private lines — expected to reach a steady state of 30 aircraft annually from 2026-27.integration of astra missile, developed by drdo, is scheduled for early august.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122234163,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-748620,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Sean Payton’s sideline clash with Bo Nix sparks fresh buzz over Broncos’ offensive reboot,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/sean-paytons-sideline-clash-with-bo-nix-sparks-fresh-buzz-over-broncos-offensive-reboot/articleshow/122252876.cms,"Sean Payton's Bo Nix era starts loud (Image credits: Instagram/X)

Bo Nix wins locker room, but Payton needs more than vibes



Engram, Lohner and the hunt for a Jimmy Graham 2.0



Sean Payton is entering a make-or-break season in Denver, and the pressure is mounting to fix an offense that has struggled since Peyton Manning’s exit. While rookie quarterback Bo Nix has generated locker room buzz, Payton knows leadership isn’t enough—production must follow. The Broncos’ offensive failures last year were glaring, from a nonexistent run game to tight ends barely factoring in. That’s why Payton has reshaped the unit, betting on fresh faces and untapped talent.Right tackle Mike McGlinchey recently admitted that Nix made an early impact, noting, “Bo captured this locker room by the way that he works, by the person that he is and the way that he progressed.” But Payton isn’t handing out praise just yet—he’s seen what happens when hype isn’t backed by execution. Nix, despite his poise, enters a system that ranked near the bottom in tight end and rushing production last season. No Denver running back crossed 550 yards, and no tight end topped 20 catches.Payton’s response was immediate: signing former Jaguars TE Evan Engram and drafting dynamic RB R.J. Harvey. He also brought in J.K. Dobbins, hoping to revive a ground attack that never got off the runway in 2023. NFL analyst John Breech recently questioned if the overhaul would be enough, saying, “My biggest question is on offense and is what are these new offensive skill players going to look like?” With Nix now the presumed starter, Payton’s vision faces a real-world test.In one fiery October clash with the Raiders, Nix missed a deep throw to Troy Franklin—and Payton lit into him on the sideline. Instead of folding, Nix barked back and then delivered two touchdown drives. That kind of fire is exactly what Payton has been searching for under center. “We’re in the business of passion,” Payton later said, contrasting Nix’s edge with Russell Wilson’s more passive demeanor.Denver’s revolving door at tight end may finally stop with Engram, who signed a two-year, $23 million deal and is drawing Jimmy Graham comparisons. Breech added, “I could see Evan Engram putting up some huge numbers this year… the Broncos offense is gonna be a lot different, but a lot more successful.” But Payton isn’t stopping at one name. He’s quietly developing rookie Caleb Lohner—a 6-foot-8 basketball convert with just 57 college snaps.“If it turns out like the last one did (Jimmy Graham), then we’d be real excited,” Payton said, referencing his past success with tight ends in New Orleans. Lohner’s raw athleticism makes him a long-term project, but the upside is high. Meanwhile, Engram is expected to start immediately, bringing explosiveness Denver has sorely missed. With layered depth at tight end, Payton is covering bases while nurturing breakout potential.Also read: Antonio Brown’s cryptic post sparks fresh firestorm over Tyler Lockett’s resurfaced virginity vow If the offense clicks and Nix settles into the role, Payton’s decisions might finally flip from “risky” to “genius.” And for Broncos Country, that turnaround can’t come soon enough.","Sean payton is entering a make-or-break season in denver.

‘I couldn't support Elon Musk any longer…’: Tesla employee resigns after 7 years citing moral conflict with Musk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/i-couldnt-support-elon-musk-any-longer-tesla-employee-resigns-after-7-years-citing-moral-conflict-with-musk/articleshow/122188860.cms,"Tesla employee resigns after 7 years citing moral conflict with Musk

‘Tesla gave me a future’: Ex-employee on how the company transformed his life

Ex-Tesla employee quits due to Musk’s politics

An emotional exit after 7 years



Respect for the company, not the leadership

After seven years of working at Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada, former engineering technician Trae Cervantes has made the difficult decision to step away from the company, citing moral discomfort with CEO Elon Musk ’s recent actions. Cervantes, who began his career as a production associate in 2018, steadily advanced to an engineering technician role before formally resigning in March 2025. His departure was not spurred by workplace conditions or job dissatisfaction, but rather by a growing unease over Musk’s political involvement and public conduct.In an interview with Business Insider, Cervantes reflected on both the opportunities and challenges he experienced at Tesla. He joined the company during the high-demand ramp-up of the Model 3 production line and described his early days as physically taxing but professionally rewarding.“I started out on their production line for the Model 3 and I moved up from there,” Cervantes said. “When I started out, it was gruelling work. It was pushing heavy things up and down aisles. I was on my feet for 12 hours a day, but they also give you three to four days off a week to recover.”Tesla supported Cervantes' growth over the years, offering him access to professional development programs, including certifications in advanced manufacturing and Lean Six Sigma through local college partnerships.Cervantes credits Tesla with helping him build a career despite having no formal education or technical training before joining the company.“I was getting paid the most I'd ever gotten in my adult life,” he said. “No education, no real skills to speak of, and Tesla offered me opportunities to take charge of my life and grow my career.”He highlighted how the work culture at Tesla—particularly among peers and supervisors—was largely positive and focused on efficiency, learning, and advancement.“I stayed because they kept treating me well. I didn’t have a reason to leave for a long time,” Cervantes noted.However, Cervantes' sentiment toward the company began to shift as Musk became more active politically and made several high-profile public moves, including acquiring Twitter and engaging in voter-related controversies.“What I took issue with the most was the giveaway for prospective voters,” he said, referring to a public campaign Musk promoted. “It seemed so morally wrong. I didn't want to be associated with that.”The turning point for Cervantes came when Musk's public image, behaviour, and political commentary became more prominent in association with Tesla’s identity.“Last year, I started to be ashamed to tell people where I work,” he admitted.While Cervantes did not go into detail about every incident that caused concern, he made it clear that the cumulative effect of Musk’s public actions led him to feel ethically conflicted about remaining with the company.Cervantes decided to leave Tesla without securing another job. He described his final conversation with his supervisor as emotional and honest.“I have to leave. I can't do this anymore. It's getting to a point where I feel like I'm compromising myself morally by walking through those doors every day,” he recalled telling his manager.The decision was not taken lightly. “I’m not going to lie, I cried a little. Seven years is a long time, and Tesla wasn’t always a bad thing for me,” Cervantes shared.While Cervantes walked away from his position at Tesla, he was careful to clarify that his issue was not with the company’s workforce or its mission, but with its leadership.“There are plenty of good people at Tesla. I didn’t leave the place because of the company. I left because of the face of the company,” he stated, referring directly to Elon Musk.","Trae cervantes worked as an engineering technician at tesla's gigafactory in nevada for seven years.

Garnet Hathaway , Samuel Ersson , and Rasmus Ristolainen no longer fit the Flyers' direction



Bokondji Imama Hit on Garnet Hathaway

10 CRAZY RASMUS RISTOLAINEN PLAYS

The Philadelphia Flyers are one step away from yet another rebuilding phase, having endured yet another disappointing season in 2024-25. While they did act ambitiously to try to change their fate, the attempted transition had an uninspiring end, necessitating evaluation again. With the more talented newcomer Trevor Zegras infusing some youth and excitement into the roster, the focus is now on eliminating the long-standing impediments faced by the franchise. Philadelphia has to finally bring itself to part ways with players who have failed in their assignments to step onto a playoff-caliber path.For all his brands of grittiness and toughness, this style is increasingly out of place in a speed-centric league. At 33 years of age, Hathaway scarcely registers on the score sheet while his hit of $2.4 million on the cap seems too much for a player who contributes meagerly on offense. With youth and faster play style taking precedence in Philadelphia, they would do better to give Hathaway's ice time to younger forwards who have that much more upside.The goaltending situation in Philadelphia, especially for Samuel Ersson, is one that invites scrutiny.The 25-year-old Swedish netminder was raised to prominence last season but was never able to genuinely assert himself as a dependable option in the long term. With Dan Vladar's trading-in and prospects Ivan Fedotov and Alexei Kolosov developing, Ersson is finding his seat squeezed out. Given that he showed sporadic glimmers of competence, the Flyers are in no position to endure another parameter of uncertainty between the pipes. It may be prudent to trade Ersson to extract whatever potential value remains.The toughest and most pressing decision is made by Rasmus Ristolainen. A divisive personality among Flyers supporters and a strong presence on the blue line for the past several years, his position has become entangled in inconsistency and internal discord. While there have been trade rumors, Philadelphia has not managed to get to the end of it. With a new regime coming in and shaking things up in the locker room, ending Ristolainen's tenure has become paramount. Letting him stay is the last thing the team needs, potentially tearing down the karma and focus that are so critical as they set about rebuilding morale and chemistry.Also Read: Zach Werenski and Odette Peters are soaking up sun-kissed luxury in Athens as part of their romantic European getaway The Philadelphia Flyers are at a critical juncture.

Steelers face crucial decision on TJ Watt ’s future

Steelers Insider Gerry Dulac Talks TJ Watt & Fitzpatrick-Ramsey Trade w/ Rich Eisen | Full Interview

The Pittsburgh Steelers are making waves this offseason, but not just with bold acquisitions. Amid reports of a “win-now” roster strategy, rumors suggest the team is preparing a record-breaking $200 million contract extension for star linebacker TJ Watt—despite ongoing trade speculation surrounding the All-Pro pass rusher.TJ Watt has long been the cornerstone of the Steelers’ defense. As a seven-time Pro Bowler and former Defensive Player of the Year, his impact on the field is undeniable. But as Pittsburgh builds a veteran-heavy roster including additions like Aaron Rodgers, DK Metcalf, and Jalen Ramsey, rumors of a potential Watt trade have emerged, creating tension around the team’s long-term direction.NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero recently criticized the trade speculation, calling it “unethical” and illogical. His point is if Pittsburgh is serious about contending for a Super Bowl in 2025, trading away its most dominant defensive player makes little sense. “A 2026 draft pick doesn’t help you,” Pelissero noted, emphasizing that Watt is too valuable to part with if the Steelers want to capitalize on this short window of opportunity.Insiders now believe Pittsburgh is more likely to extend Watt than move him. Reports suggest the Steelers are working on a five-year extension worth over $200 million, an average annual value north of $40 million.That would make Watt the highest-paid defensive player in NFL history, surpassing recent deals signed by Myles Garrett ($160M) and Maxx Crosby ($106.5M).Steelers insider Gerry Dulac also confirmed Watt is seeking a five-year deal, not a shorter term, due to cap flexibility and structure. A contract of this size would signal Pittsburgh’s full commitment to a Super Bowl run while locking in one of the league’s most elite edge rushers through the remainder of his prime.Also Read: Jessie Bates ranked No. 92 in NFL Top 100 despite dominant season; Falcons believe he deserves more The Steelers now face a defining choice: commit long-term to their defensive leader or risk destabilizing the roster with an ill-timed trade. Based on insider reports, the franchise is leaning toward the former and a $200 million deal could be signed before Week 1 of the 2025 NFL season.",Tj watt has long been the cornerstone of the steelers’ defense.

Microsoft’s middle management is the target in its second largest ever round of layoffs



Microsoft laid off approximately 9,000 employees Wednesday, marking the company's second major workforce reduction this year. The cuts, affecting less than 4% of Microsoft's global workforce, hit the Xbox gaming division particularly hard, with several high-profile game cancellations and studio closures announced alongside the layoffs.The job cuts span multiple teams across geographies and tenure levels as Microsoft seeks to streamline operations and reduce management layers. The company cited ""organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace"" as the primary driver for the workforce reduction.The layoffs eliminated hundreds of positions across Microsoft's gaming subsidiaries, including King (makers of Candy Crush), ZeniMax, Raven Software, Sledgehammer Games, Halo Studios, and Turn 10 Studios. Microsoft also shuttered The Initiative studio and canceled the highly anticipated Perfect Dark reboot and fantasy game Everwild after years of development.Microsoft's Stockholm-based King division is cutting 10% of its workforce, eliminating approximately 200 positions. The Initiative, a premium Xbox studio established to develop AAA exclusives, will close entirely following the Perfect Dark cancellation . Rare Studio's Everwild, in development for several years, was also terminated alongside ZeniMax Online Studios' unannounced project.""To position Gaming for enduring success and allow us to focus on strategic growth areas, we will end or decrease work in certain areas of the business,"" Xbox CEO Phil Spencer told employees in an internal memo. The gaming division employed about 20,000 people as of January 2024.The latest cuts represent Microsoft's fourth mass layoff in the gaming division within 18 months, following the company's $69 billion Activision Blizzard acquisition in October 2023. Microsoft previously eliminated 6,000 positions in May, targeting product and engineering roles, plus an additional 300 workers in June.The company cited the need to ""remove layers of management to increase agility and effectiveness"" while redirecting resources toward artificial intelligence development. Microsoft's AI-related expenses reached approximately $80 billion in the last fiscal year as it competes in the generative AI market.“We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace,” the spokesperson said.Affected employees will receive severance packages including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources, with priority consideration for other positions within Microsoft's broader organization.","Microsoft laid off approximately 9,000 employees wednesday, marking the company's second major workforce reduction this year.

Whether one likes it or not, America was built by immigrants, the wretched masses that the Statue of Liberty inscription asks to welcome with open arms. From Albert Einstein to Elon Musk, immigrants made America a great country, and now it looks like they are making America great again (MAGA, as the slogan goes), and this time in artificial intelligence. America’s edge isn’t just its innovation, it's the global brainpower who has been giving an edge to the country for centuries. And nothing makes that clearer than the news out of Meta’s new Superintelligence Lab: 11 top AI researchers hired, and every single one of them is an immigrant.That’s right, not one US undergrad among them. These are elite engineers, model architects, and machine learning pioneers who began their academic journeys in India, China, South Africa, the UK, and Australia. They trained in America’s best labs, built some of the most advanced AI systems at OpenAI, DeepMind, and Anthropic, and now they’ve been snapped up by Zuckerberg to build the next wave of intelligence. If you want to understand why the US leads the world in AI, you don’t need to look at GPUs or model benchmarks. Just look at the passports of the people writing the code.Immigrants have long been the silent engine of Silicon Valley. From coding at Google to architecting cloud infrastructure at Microsoft, they form the backbone of America’s biggest tech empires. A significant number of these engineers hail from India, whose talent pipeline has become essential to the innovation output of the U.S. tech sector.

Intel CEO Lip Bu Tan may be planning this 'big change' in company's chip manufacturing business,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-ceo-lip-bu-tan-may-be-planning-this-big-change-in-companys-chip-manufacturing-business/articleshow/122214957.cms,"Why Intel’s new CEO may not be ‘happy’ with chipmaking process promoted by ex-chief



Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan is reportedly planning a ‘big change’ to the company's chip manufacturing business to attract major customers. This potential shift deviates from his predecessor's plans and could involve substantial investment. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, two sources familiar with the matter revealed that this new strategy for Intel's foundry business would involve offering outside customers a newer generation of technology. Analysts also reportedly believe that this next-generation chipmaking process would position Intel more competitively against Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (TSMC) in securing large clients like Apple or Nvidia.After taking over as the company’s new CEO in March, Tan has been reassessing the company's investment in its 18A chip manufacturing process, which was promoted by former CEO Pat Gelsinger .The Reuters report cited sources to claim that Tan has expressed concerns that 18A is not attracting enough external clients and may result in a major financial write-off if Intel stops marketing it to new customers. Intel has already spent billions on developing 18A and its variant, 18A-P.While Intel continues using 18A for in-house chips and select commitments to companies like Amazon and Microsoft , Tan may be shifting focus to the 14A process, the Reuters report claims.Intel believes 14A could offer a stronger competitive position against Taiwan-based rival TSMC, whose N2 and N3 technologies are already in production or close to it, the report adds.As per the Reuters report, Tan is expected to present strategic options to Intel’s board, potentially by this month. However, a final decision may not come until later in the year due to the high stakes involved.Meanwhile, Intel continues restructuring under Tan’s leadership, with steps including new engineering hires and streamlined management. Last year, Intel posted a net loss of $18.8 billion, which was its first unprofitable year since 1986, as it works to regain ground lost in past tech transitions.","Intel ceo lip-bu tan is reportedly planning a ‘big change’ to the company's chip manufacturing business to attract major customers.

Underground market





The biggest threat facing the Telugu film industry today isn’t competition or content fatigue—it’s piracy, a silent predator that strikes at the industry’s financial lifeline. Over the past decade, piracy is estimated to have drained over Rs 20,000 crore from the industry. In 2024 alone, while box office collections ranged between Rs 1,500 crore and Rs 2,000 crore, piracy inflicted losses of nearly Rs 3,700 crore, surpassing even theatrical earnings.With nearly 200 websites across the world illegally streaming Telugu films, the industry believes that only a robust legal crackdown, particularly on digital intermediaries, can curb this growing menace.“These criminals can’t stay hidden forever. If the law holds intermediaries accountable, the actual perpetrators can be identified and prosecuted,” said A Raj Kumar, head of the anti-piracy wing, Telugu Film Chamber of Commerce (TFCC).By intermediaries, he refers to content delivery networks, web hosting firms, and domain registrars that often host pirated content but claim no responsibility. He argued these players must not be allowed to escape liability simply by distancing themselves from the content they enable.Most piracy operations today are funded via cryptocurrency, making the money trail hard to follow. However, tracking payments to intermediaries could unlock vital leads. “If we go after the digital enablers, piracy can be stopped at its source,” Raj Kumar said.In a proactive legal move, a production house recently approached the Hyderabad commercial court ahead of a film’s release on June 2, seeking to restrain rogue websites from uploading pirated versions. The court issued an interim order, barring all respondents from hosting, streaming, or communicating the film until July 25. The next hearing is scheduled for the same date.“The public must also do its part. Watching pirated films may seem harmless, but it directly hurts the industry,” said KL Damodar Prasad, secretary, TFCC. “Curbing piracy helps filmmakers reinvest and create more content,” he said.The rising quality of pirated prints is another troubling factor. Pirates now use high-end smartphones or camcorders, enhance footage using software, and produce near-watchable versions within hours of release. They are reportedly paid $500 for small films and up to $1,000 for big-budget releases.","Piracy is estimated to have drained over rs 20,000 crore from the industry.

During the golden age for ferries in the 1800s, steamboats dotted the shorelines of coastal cities to transport passengers. Then cars and trains took over. Now, driven by congestion and the revitalisation of urban waterfronts, ferries are making a comeback. But, what operators struggle to offer is a fast, sustainable mode of transit. ""Commuters want speed,"" said Jakob Kuttenkeuler, a professor of naval architecture at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm.Over the last few months, however, Stockholm has been testing a vessel that may solve that problem: the world's first electric hydrofoil ferry.Developed by a Swedish start-up, Candela, a 30-seat, battery-driven vessel known as the P-12 has almost halved the commute time of a conventional diesel ferry - to 30 minutes - across an 11-mile stretch between the island of Ekero and City Hall in the centre of Stockholm. At the same time, the P-12 emits 95% less emissions than the diesel ferry and uses 80% less energy, according to SL, the Stockholm public transport authority.Gustav Hasselskog, Candela's founder and chief executive, said the realisation, 11 years ago, that his speedboat guzzled 15 times as much fuel as his car had set him on a course to develop an energy-efficient maritime solution. ""High-speed passenger ferries and boats are the least fuel-efficient mode of transit in the world because almost all energy is used to push away the water,"" he said.""If you convert to electric, you need massive amounts of batteries, which are expensive and have limited range. The only way to go far and fast on the same battery is when you hydrofoil."" Hydrofoils are the winglike structures mounted under a boat's hull to lift the craft above the water as it gains speed, much as airplane wings do through the air. The technique drastically reduces drag from water friction and allows for faster, more energy-efficient travel.Kuttenkeuler, who invented the Efoil, an electric hydrofoil board that glides above the water's surface, said hydrofoil technology was a common marine transport system in the 1980s but was phased out because of the high operational costs. Advancements in digitalization, composite materials and sensor technology have contributed to its comeback, he added.In addition to the environmental benefits, the electric hydrofoil has several other advantages. The batteries are relatively small, so they do not require massive charging infrastructure. They do not generate waves that erode the shoreline or wreak havoc for windsurfers and moored boats in their wake. And because they are kept level by a computer and soar over the waves, they do not cause seasickness.So far, Mumbai, India, has the most ambitious plans for the P-12. JalVimana, the local shuttle operator, will begin with 11 ferries on popular tourist routes from the Gateway of India to Alibag and Elephanta Island. A third route will connect the airport with the centre of Mumbai, cutting travel time from 90 minutes by car to less than 30 minutes on the water.","Swedish start-up candela has developed the world's first electric hydrofoil ferry.

Renovating the world’s largest fountain: The hidden work behind Dubai’s iconic water show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/renovating-the-worlds-largest-fountain-the-hidden-work-behind-dubais-iconic-water-show/articleshow/122257332.cms,"The Dubai Fountain’s renovation upgrades its flooring, technology, and maintenance systems, with engineers and workers operating 24/7 across its 18-football-field-sized pool/ Image: Instagram

A Fountain Like No Other: The Scale of the Task



The Ongoing Renovation : A Major Overhaul



New Flooring System: The old concrete surface had occasional cracks, disrupting maintenance. Now, a durable waterproofing system is being installed, including a special primer and insulation designed to help with water retention.

Glowing Blue Tiles: These tiles, visible beneath the water from all angles around the lake, are not just visually striking but also functional, adding to the overall aesthetic and longevity of the structure.

Robotic Technology : A Fountain Powered by Machines



Choreography Bots: These robots control the movement of the water jets, ensuring they spray in perfect rhythm with the music.

Lighting Bots: These robots adjust the lighting, ensuring that the visual effects are perfectly in sync with the water's movements.

Fixed Water Jets: These jets spray water in harmony with the beats, adding another layer of coordination to the show.

Keeping Everything Clean: The Underwater Maintenance



A Temporary Pause, but the Show Goes On







The Dubai Fountain is known for its captivating performances, synchronized water jets, dazzling lights, and perfectly timed music. As the world’s largest choreographed fountain, it draws millions of visitors each year to the heart of Downtown Dubai. But what does it really take to maintain and renovate this iconic spectacle? From intricate underwater technology to the massive team of engineers and robots working tirelessly, the work behind maintaining and renovating the Dubai Fountain never stops. It goes on around the clock, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, ensuring this iconic water show continues to dazzle visitors long into the future. Here’s a closer look at the monumental effort behind the scenes.The Dubai Fountain isn’t just big; it’s enormous. The fountain stretches over an area as large as 18 football fields. Beneath its shimmering surface lies a sophisticated network of water jets, robotic arms, and lighting systems, all working in perfect harmony to create the mesmerizing shows that have made it famous.Given its sheer size, it's no surprise that keeping the fountain in top shape requires a lot of work. In fact, hundreds of engineers and technicians are involved in maintaining the fountain, handling everything from daily upkeep to major renovations.In April 2025, the fountain was temporarily shut down for a five-month renovation to improve its performance, aesthetics, and longevity. The project, confirmed by the fountain’s developer Emaar, involves an array of upgrades. Though the renovation has taken the fountain offline, the work behind it will ensure that the Dubai Fountain continues to dazzle for years to come.Key improvements include:These changes aren't just about making the fountain look better, they aim to ensure that the fountain runs smoothly and efficiently for years to come.One of the most fascinating aspects of the Dubai Fountain is the extensive use of robotic technology. From choreography bots that control the movement of water to lighting bots that match visual effects with the rhythm of the music, these robots play a crucial role in every performance. In fact, the programming of a single song for the fountain can take several weeks, as multiple robotic systems must be synchronized to create the perfect dance of water and light.The renovation also involves upgrading the technology behind these systems to improve precision and reduce the time it takes to program a new performance. As a result, the fountain will continue to deliver unforgettable shows, with even better choreography and lighting.Beneath the water's surface, maintenance is just as crucial. The fountain's 1.3-meter-deep lake houses the powerful jets and robots, which means it requires constant attention to stay pristine.To keep the fountain looking its best, underwater robots are deployed regularly. These machines clean the lakebed and ensure the water remains at the highest quality. The newly installed soft flooring makes cleaning even quicker and more efficient, allowing for easier maintenance. Water quality checks are conducted regularly, with samples taken from various parts of the lake to ensure the water stays fresh and clear.While the fountain is temporarily out of action, Emaar has ensured that visitors still get a taste of its magic. The construction area has been cleverly integrated with digital display screens that play archival footage of the fountain’s past performances, in sync with the light shows from the Burj Khalifa. So even though the live fountain shows are paused, the spirit of the Dubai Fountain is still alive, giving visitors a preview of the wonder to come.The renovation is scheduled to wrap up by October 2025, just in time for the cooler months. When the fountain is back in action, it will not only look better but also function more smoothly, thanks to the impressive behind-the-scenes work currently underway.","The dubai fountain’s renovation upgrades its flooring, technology, and maintenance systems, with engineers and workers operating 24/7 across its 18-football-field-sized pool.
