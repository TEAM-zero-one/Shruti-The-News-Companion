Delhi Headlines Today — The Biggest Updates You Need to Know.

NEW DELHI: Environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa has said that over 10,000 vehicles have failed emission tests since the implementation of GRAP-4 and over 2 lakh have been issued Pollution Under Control (PUC) certificates.He added that govt is also upgrading all PUC centres with high-capacity equipment to reduce delays and ensure accurate emission testing.Additionally, a third-party inspection mechanism will be introduced to strengthen credibility and transparency in certification.He said the 2 lakh vehicles got the PUC tests done after the ""No PUC, No Fuel"" rule came into effect. Nearly 10,000 vehicles that were tested failed to meet the standards. ""This clearly indicates that the enforcement measures are being implemented seriously and are yielding results,"" Sirsa added.According to experts, the current on-road vehicle inspection programme is weak and based on simple idle testing of CO and hydrocarbons (HC) at two speed idle tests, along with Lambda test for petrol vehicles and smoke density test for diesel vehicles.Researchers at DTU had earlier rolled out an AQI-type PUC certificate system that considered the mileage of vehicles too when testing for emissions.They referred to older studies published with the Atmospheric Pollution Research and American Society of Civil Engineers (ACSE), and suggested inspections and maintenance, along with mileage, as important factors that should be incorporated in PUC tests.Dr Rajeev Kumar Mishra, associate professor at the department of environmental science and engineering at DTU, said the testing now and recertification for in-use cars should include fast idle conditions as well as mass emission testing. The PUC certificate is given just based on the CO and hydrocarbon emissions when the car is in the idle state, meaning the engine is not revving, he said. Emissions such as NO2, PM2.5 and VOC at the fast idling stage at 2500 rpm are sometimes recorded, but these are not considered during certification, he pointed out.""Identifying which vehicles should be phased out or issued PUC certificates should be based on the accumulated mileage, maintenance records, and performance according to both emission norms, not just by age,"" Mishra said. There are no standards from BS-6, and every vehicle is tested based on its built type, he added.According to a study by CSE, vehicle emissions are one of Delhi's major source of air pollution and have a direct impact on human health. While PUC checks may keep the highly polluting vehicles off the road, it still doesn't address the harmful emissions such as PM2.5 and other toxic gases.""Various studies on source apportionment and emission inventory have shown that vehicles are the second largest contributor of particulate emissions. Vehicles are responsible for highly toxic exposures as the emissions happen at the breathing height,"" said Shambhavi Shukla, programme manager on air pollution at the Centre for Science and Environment. She suggested more updated vehicle emission surveillance systems, such as remote sensing mechanisms.She pointed to another layer of problems in PUC certification — the centres themselves. ""CSE and EPCA conducted an audit in 2017 of PUC system in Delhi-NCR. They found that at many places, certificates were issued without putting the probe into the tailpipe. In NCR, there were centres that had only printers, not even a monitor. There were instances when different centres showed varying results. PUC staff should have a compulsory ITI certificate but that was not the case,"" she said.","Environment minister manjinder singh sirsa has said that over 10,000 vehicles have failed emission tests since the implementation of grap-4. He added that govt is also upgrading all puc centres with high-capacity equipment to reduce delays and ensure accurate emission testing.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126131450,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-null,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Shane McMahon’s WWE legacy and wealth creation

Business ventures and Marissa Mazzola-McMahon’s role

Shane McMahon and Marissa Mazzola-McMahon, who both served as WWE Producer/Director, are worth a combined $650 million, the result of decades spent near one of sports entertainment’s most influential families and a carefully curated soon-to-branch portfolio beyond the ring. Shane, as a key McMahon heir, has had his financial profile associated with WWE's ascendance to a worldwide media conglomerate for decades, while Marissa's career has been largely away from the limelight.Their fortune, collectively, is uneven but complementary at best. The vast bulk of the couple's wealth originates from Shane, who owns most of the couple's cash, investments, and property, as Marissa’s professional income and personal assets serve to augment, not scale, the family nest-egg. Rumors in the financial, as well as the gossip and entertainment worlds, have put their collective net gross at around $205 million by the year 2025, but the numbers are tightly held secret from the outside world.Even hooks have different weights, and for Shane McMahon, his financial foundation came from WWE, where he served in various capacities as an executive, on-camera talent, and brand representative. He was in charge when WWE became a publicly traded, globally syndicating corporation, a transition that paid senior insiders in the form of salaries, bonuses and equity-linked pay.Shane also became recognized over the years for the insane, risk-taking, high impact, physical matches that elevated his brand and worth.Overall, Shane's net worth is often assumed to be around $200 million in 2025 as an individual. That number includes years of WWE and associated earnings, assets from the McMahon family estate, and WWE-affiliated corporate relationships. Although he was never as high on the control totem pole as his old man, Vince, his standing in the company meant he was around some significant cash decisions in WWE's most successful years.Shane McMahon has built up a portfolio of separate business interests away from the world of WWE, with a particular focus on technology, media, and emerging industries. He has been chairman and advisor to a number of companies, as part of the indication that he might be looking to diversify beyond wrestling-related income.

She comes from a film production and corporate public relations background, and her career has been built on cash flows, not large equity windfalls.

Torrie Wilson’s WWE legacy and long-term earnings

Justin Tupper’s business career and investment footprint

Torrie Wilson and Justin Tupper are often described as a low-key power couple of WWE, balancing a legacy sports-entertainment career with modern digital media leadership. While Wilson is a well-known name around the world in wrestling circles, Tupper has flown a bit under the radar in the business of sports and content platforms.Uniting as a couple, their 2025 net worth speaks to both prudent career choices, diversified income sources, and a life of relatively low pomp and circumstance. Instead of bombastic and excessive numbers and stories, their financial narrative thrives through longevity, strategy, and continual relevancy.Another notable entry on the list is Torrie Wilson, who racked up her wealth in the early 2000s, which is viewed as the peak of WWE's commercial success. Without a doubt, one of the most recognisable Divas in company history, the television contracts, pay-per-view bonuses, merchandise royalties, modelling opportunities, and other ventures outside of wrestling all accumulated over the years. She also snatched up mainstream magazine covers, including shots in fitness and lifestyle magazines, which only increased her earning power.Wilson continued his earnings through WWE Legends deals as well as convention and Hall of Fame appearances, even after walking away from full-time wrestling.However, in recent years, she has earned an income with social media partnerships and fitness brand collaborations. Her personal net worth by 2025 is estimated to be anywhere around $2 million, a number not so much created by in-ring work at that point but rather from the appropriate use of a well-maintained brand.Yet Justin Tupper’s earning power from a different professional world also adds immensely to the couple’s overall wealth. Tupper took advantage of early trends in direct-to-consumer sports media as the founder of Revolution Golf, a digital golf instruction and commerce platform. His company's being purchased and absorbed into a greater media universe was a seminal financial moment of his professional life.After the success, Tupper had moved into senior management positions in tech firms that serviced sports and entertainment firms, earning a salary and long-term incentives on an ongoing basis. His net worth is probably not public knowledge, but as a benchmark for startup executives at his level with founder exits, the assets are in the low-to-mid seven-figure range. His financial profile consists of business equity rather than salary to be reinvested, rather than being a random celebrity income.Also Read: Trish Stratus and Ron Fisico combined net worth in 2025: WWE legacy, fitness ventures, and family wealth","Torrie wilson and justin tupper are a low-key power couple of wwe.

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon musk has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

Kevin Durant’s trade from Suns to the Houston Rockets in exchange for Jalen Green, Dillon Brooks, and involving seven teams and several draft picks, officially made the 2014 MVP the highest-paid man in NBA history with projected career earnings of approximately $600 million that surpass that of LeBron James.At just 37, Kevin Durant is commanding more money and is raising the financial standard of the league while some of his contemporaries struggle to even hold on with the changing rhythm of the league. Durant’s trade to the Rockets in July 2025 was nothing short of a blockbuster deal. With the Rockets, Durant has clocked in 36.7 minutes on court per game while averaging 25.3 points, 5.0 rebounds, and 4.1 assists, shooting 50.9% from the field and 43.5% from the three-pointer line.Kevin Durant, post his trade, signed a 2-year extension with the Rockets in October 2025 worth $90 million. This deal promises him a cap hit of $43 million in 2026 and $46 million in 2027 with a player option, illustrating a masterclass in modern sports business. For the current 2025-26 season, Durant is set to earn $54.7 million under his previous agreement.Kevin Durant might have accepted an extension below his maximum eligible amount, but this provides the Rockets with the cap flexibility to fill the bench with exceptional talents and increase the chances for him to win his third NBA championship.But even with this salary dip, Durant’s contract remains a significant moment for other veteran players, considering he’s in his 19th NBA season.As per Spotrac, with this extension, Kevin Durant nudges past LeBron James with projected earnings of $591 million to conquer the top place on the list of players with the highest NBA career earnings.The NBA paycheck is hefty, but for Kevin Durant, it is just one half of the coin.

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s joinery from Manipal





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella once shared his experience of how not going to IIT which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him. The IIT rejection redirected his life towards a path only few could have imagined and which eventually led him to become the CEO of Microsoft, one of the world’s most valuable companies. Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software. Nadella further added that like many of friends he also viewed IIT as the pinnacle of academic achievement. But when he failed to secure admission, Nadella faced a setback that could have easily defined his future. Instead, it became the catalyst for a different journey.Nadella described IIT as “the holy grail” for middle-class students, acknowledging the weight of expectations. Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there. However, all these experiences helped him in building adaptability which later went ahead and defined his leadership style.Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992, after working at Sun Microsystems. Over, the next two decade he rose steadily through the ranks and the became the Microsoft CEO in 2014. When Nadella became the CEO, the company was facing a lot competition from Apple, Google and Amazon. However, under his leadership, Microsoft reinvented itself and it now a market valuation of $3.54 trillion.Nadella has often said that “only in America would someone like me get the chance to prove himself rather than be typecast based on the school I attended.”","Microsoft ceo satya nadella once shared his experience of how not going to iit which he describes as the ""the holy grail"" for middle-class students became a turning point for him.

The state of AI adoption





American billionaire and entrepreneur Mark Cuban has now urged the young engineers entering the job market to prioritise small and medium-sized companies over multinational corporations (MNCs) when seeking opportunities in artificial intelligence (AI). Cuban feels that smaller companies offer better platform for new graduates to make an immediate impact, while large corporations often dilute individual contributions.Speaking in an interview with CNBC and on his podcast The Dumbest Guy in the Room, Cuban explained that smaller companies are mainly entrepreneur-driven and they lack the deep IT departments or larger corporations. This gap creates opportunities for fresh graduates which directly contribute to the AI projects.“Small- to medium-size companies don’t have that depth. They are typically entrepreneurially driven and don’t have the flexibility to have people research things. Bringing a new graduate on to work on agentic AI projects is inexpensive for them and can get them immediate results,” Cuban said.Cuban also used the example of his own company, Cost Plus Drugs, noting how AI can automate processes to boost productivity, competitiveness, and profitability.Cuban argued that in big organisations, AI skills may not stand out as they are common among thousands of IT employees. On the other hand, in smaller firms often lack such expertise, making new graduates with AI knowledge invaluable. He also compared the present wave of AI with early days of the internet, when young engineers were hired to implement new technologies because they were more comfortable with them than older executives.Cuban also highlighted that 95% of companies have not yet seen measurable revenue returns from AI investments. The exceptions, he said, are mostly early-stage startups led by young entrepreneurs who design their processes around AI models tailored to their businesses.He urged his children and other young people to learn as much as possible about AI, stressing that companies are still grappling with how to use the technology for competitive advantage.",Mark cuban has urged young engineers to prioritise small and medium-sized companies over multinational corporations (mncs) when seeking opportunities in artificial intelligence.

Arattai app gets end-to-end encryption







Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu was recently asked by an X (formerly Twitter) user why there is no talk about Arattai now? The user quoted a post stating that Telegram is worth $30 billion with only 30 employees working from home, no office. Responding to the user’s question, Vembu shared that the company is doing “updates weekly” and is working on “some very important features”. “We will market it more once we feel we are satisfied with the feature set!,” Vembu posted, adding “This is a marathon. We are geared for it.”To recall, the Arattai app debuted in 2021 as a rival to Meta’s WhatsApp. Years after its launch, the app recently gained momentum after senior government ministers like Piyush Goyal joined the platform. In September this year, Arattai (meaning chat in Tamil) topped App Store ranking, registering 3,50,000 signs in just three days.Arattai offers familiar features such as:However, the app is still ironing out issues. Users have reported OTP delays, slower contact sync, and call glitches due to server overload.Last month, the company rolled out system-wide end-to-end encryption on the Arattai app. Announcing the release in an X post, Vembu then said that it is a “forced upgrade on all because it is a drastic change”.“We had to do some redesign around it and we wanted extensive testing because it is a drastic change. It is now being tested by about 6,000 people in the company. We identified some issues and have fixed them.

He co-founded Infinity Ward in 2002, where he spearheaded the original Call of Duty in 2003—a World War II game that evolved into one of gaming's most successful franchises. The series has sold over 500 million copies globally and generated more than $30 billion in revenue.After his contentious 2010 departure from Activision and subsequent legal settlement, Zampella established Respawn Entertainment.

Alexandr Wang is reportedly clashing with Meta’s old guard

Meta’s Secret AI Army: Top Talent Hired from OpenAI, Google & More

Alexandr Wang memo on Meta's massive AI restructure





In June this year, Facebook-parent Meta Platforms agreed to take a 49% stake in artificial intelligence (AI) startup Scale AI for $14.8 billion. As part of the deal, Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang took top position inside Meta, leading the company's new “superintelligence” lab, , Meta Superintelligence Labs, or MSL. The 28-year-old founder of Scale AI, Wang has been installed as the public face of Zuckerberg’s AI reboot. Mark Zuckerberg reportedly paid billions to bring billionaire AI prodigy Alexandr Wang on board. However, it reportedly seems that all is not well between the AI wunderkind and his Boss, Mark Zuckerberg. The 41-year-old Zuckerberg is said to have backed his new hires with nine-figure compensation packages to lure top researchers from rivals, igniting a Silicon Valley poaching war.According to a report in Financial Times, Wang privately believes that CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s micromanagement of the company’s AI push is ""suffocating"". Wang is said to have complained to associates that Zuckerberg’s tight grip on the effort is stifling progress, the report said, citing multiple people familiar with the situation. Report adds that cracks have begun to emerge at an executive level and that tensions have been bubbling between Wang and Zuckerberg for sometime now.As per the report, internally, some staff question whether Wang is out of his depth, given his lack of experience managing teams in a large corporation but also his expertise in AI data services rather than as an AI researcher pushing technical breakthroughs.Incidentally, Alexander Wang’s arrival at Meta has created friction over the company's fundamental approach to AI development, with his superintelligence team pushing to make the company’s next model “closed” — keeping its technology secret. This is said to mark a major departure from Meta’s longtime philosophy of open-sourcing its models for other developers to build upon, causing some old guard members to chafe at the change, the Times reported.The new leadership has chosen to abandon Meta’s previous frontier model called Behemoth, which saw its release delayed last spring after disappointing performance tests. Meta’s AI division faces a dramatic four-way split as Meta reorganizes into groups focused on research, superintelligence development, products, and infrastructure, according to the report.As the new vision and leadership have crystallised, some top names have left. Among them, in recent weeks, Meta’s longtime chief legal officer Jennifer Newstead was poached by arch-rival Apple, while chief revenue officer John Hegeman announced he too was leaving to launch a start-up.Similarly, chief AI scientist and Turing Award winner Yann LeCun is departing Meta to launch a new AI initiative. He had reportedly taken exception at having to report to Wang. Another reason cited for his resignation is that his longer-term research was reportedly hit hard by the recent cuts announced at Meta.Meta reorganized its AI teams in June this year. The memo said that most team leaders will report directly to 28-year-old Wang. This included investor and former GitHub CEO Nat Friedman, who heads MSL's product team and was announced as an MSL leader alongside Wang in June. In the email sent to employees, Wang wrote that ""superintelligence is coming,"" and to ""take it seriously,"" Meta needs to make major changes. This includes establishing four distinct teams that focus on research, training, products, and infrastructure.",Alexandr wang is reportedly clashing with meta’s old guard.
