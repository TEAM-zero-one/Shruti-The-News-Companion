Muslim-led startups filling gaps in India’s economy



NEW DELHI: On most evenings in New York, or Delhi-NCR, Ruha Shadab sits across a laptop screen, explaining professional etiquette to a roomful of Muslim women. Some wear hijabs. Some don’t. What unites them is not appearance. They are learning how to enter professional spaces that were never designed with them in mind. The session is about LinkedIn summaries, interview posture and how to talk about ambition. Many are the first in their families preparing for formal work.Far away in Jharkhand’s Garhwa, Nadim Iqbal Khan scans stock-market data on his phone. He’s checking which listed companies pass a religious test: No alcohol. No gambling. Limited debt. No interest-heavy income (Riba). Mohd Sufyan’s AzanGuru in Delhi beams Quran tutors into iPads — a technology-led learning app for modern learners.And in Mumbai, Nidah Merchant devises “modest” outfits, empowering women to enter public pools or gyms without constant self-surveillance, even as Mohammad Saif Nadeem in Pune manages Qurbani bookings over WhatsApp.None describe what they are building as “political” or as “resistance”.They’re solving ordinary problems — how to work, invest, dress, marry and practise faith in an urban, app-mediated life.Muslim aspiration in India is usually framed through “lack” — less education, fewer jobs, lower incomes. That’s slowly changing. According to Periodic Labour Force Survey, India’s female labour force participation stood at about 31.7% in 2023–24. For Muslim women, it was around 21%, up from about 15% in 2021–22, according to ministry of minority affairs. These numbers shape decisions.When Ruha Shadab returned to India after studying abroad, she often found herself the only Muslim woman in professional rooms. Being Muslim in Saudi Arabia was not a distinguishing feature. Here, it shaped first impressions. The contrast stayed with her. “I realised quickly that I was being read before I was being heard,” she told TOI. She said she sometimes detected a hiring bias.In 2019, while studying at Harvard University, Shadab founded Led By, to help Muslim women transition from education to employment. The programme focuses on women aged 18–30, college students or graduates from lower middle-income households. About 1,200 women have completed Led By’s programmes and over 50,000 have been supported. Many are first-generation professionals. Economic participation also depends on money. For decades, many Indian Muslims kept their distance from stock markets. Interest-based income raised religious doubts. Trading felt uncomfortably close to speculation. Nadim Iqbal Khan, 29, said, “People don’t call me asking how to get rich. They call asking if something is halal.” The questions are about permissibility, not profits.Since Covid-19, volume of queries has multiplied. He explains investing as “shared ownership” in a business, where both profit and loss are borne, making the income permissible within Islamic frameworks. And follows Sharia-compliant screening frameworks used globally. Roughly half of India’s listed companies qualify, he says. Indices such as the Nifty Shariah and BSE Shariah already track them. “Muslims have stayed behind financially because of lack of guidance. That gap can be fixed.”If money has moved into markets, marriage has moved into apps. As families became more nuclear, traditional “rishta networks” thinned. In 2019, Delhi-based entrepreneur Hammad Rahman launched NikahForever, a Muslim matrimony platform designed for marriage, not dating. Users wanted cultural familiarity, privacy and clear intent. Families wanted safeguards. NikahForever built its platform around these expectations. Today, it has over 2 million registered users in India and away.Clothing carries similar negotiations. For Mumbai’s Nidah Merchant, modest fashion was never a statement. It was logistical. Gym wear. Swim wear. Travel clothes. Constant adjustment. When modest fashion gained visibility on social media, Merchant realised this struggle was widely shared. The need, she says, was functional, not ideological. She launched Némah, a modest activewear and swimwear brand for women in 2020 to design clothes suited to Indian conditions.Education completes the picture. During the pandemic, Quran learning moved online but remained fragmented. AzanGuru, founded by Muhammad Sufyan Saif and Mohammed Imran in 2022, sought to digitise Quran learning. The platform has crossed 5 lakh downloads.Taken together, these ventures form an economy shaped less by ideology than by need, filling gaps where the mainstream falls short.","Muslim aspiration in india is usually framed through “lack’ — less education, fewer jobs, lower incomes.

EU, India To Sign Security And Defence Pact In New Delhi, Aim To Conclude FTA Talks: Kaja Kallas

.

NEW DELHI: India and the European Union have concluded negotiations for a free trade agreement that will cover goods, services and other aspects of engagement with the deal set to be announced by leaders from the two sides on Tuesday, commerce secretary Rajesh Agrawal said.""It will be a balanced, forward-looking deal for better economic integration with the EU. It will propel trade and investment between both sides,"" Agrawal said on Monday on the agreement that has been under negotiation for more than 18 years, but got a lease of life in 2024. US President Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs are seen to have pushed both sides to engage more aggressively to finalise the agreement, factoring in each other's concerns in sectors such as agriculture and dairy.The agreement may, however, take a few months to be ratified and is likely to be implemented in early 2027, officials said. Over the next two weeks, the two sides will put together a cleaner text of the agreement, which will be legally vetted over the next 5-6 months before it is signed. The agreement will then have to be ratified by the European Parliament, but officials explained that it will not have to be approved by each member-state of the 27-nation bloc since it does not contain ""mixed competence"".India is expected to get zero-duty access to several key product segments such as textiles, leather and marine products, in return for concessions in sectors such as automobiles and wines and spirits.In a TV interview, European commissioner for trade and economic security MaroS Šefcovic said the aim was to see full or partial tariff reduction on 97-99% of goods, while factoring in sensitivity in sectors such as agriculture and dairy. He said the trading bloc was looking for a ""combination"" of lower tariffs on a specified number of vehicles along with phased reduction. He said India was a smaller market compared to EU, but growing rapidly, and auto was an important sector for both sides. He said it is a sector that is complementary given that India makes small cars, while European automakers focused on larger and technologically more advanced vehicles. ""We are looking at the way which would help us find solutions, create new supply chains and make an even better business case for European car makers, while opening new possibilities for cooperation,"" Šefcovic said.He underlined the broader strategic intent of the FTA in building resilient supply chains, reducing risky dependencies and creating jobs in India and EU.","India and the european union have concluded negotiations for a free trade agreement.

NEW DELHI: The Kerala unit of Congress is again at the centre of a controversy after its ""cow urine research"" remarks on Padma Shri winner IIT Madras director V Kamakoti. The comments received a sharp retort from Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu who came out in defence of Kamakoti.The Kerala Congress, in a post on X, congratulated Kamakoti on the civilian honour while taking a dig at his work, saying, “Congratulations to V Kamakoti on receiving the honour. The nation recognises your bleeding edge research on Cow Urine at IIT Madras, taking Gomutra to world stage.”Reacting on January 26, Vembu highlighted Kamakoti’s academic credentials and role in national service. “Professor Kamakoti works in deep tech: micro-processor design. He is the Director of IIT-Madras, the best technological institution in India. He serves in the NSAB. He richly deserves the honour,” he wrote on X.Defending the scientific validity of studying traditional substances, Vembu said, “I have defended him on scientific grounds and I will do so again: cow dung and cow urine have excellent microbiome that could be valuable for humans. It is the slavish colonial mindset that thinks these are not scientific propositions worthy of investigation.Some day, when Harvard or MIT publish a study on this, these enslaved minds would worship that as the gospel truth. ”Kamakoti, who is among this year’s Padma Shri award ees, earlier described the honour as a collective achievement. In a video shared on January 25, he said, “The Padma Shri award means only thing to me, that I will put all the best efforts towards Viksit Bharat @ 2047, this award is not possible as an individual, it's a collective effort, I dedicate this award to all who contributed...

Planning a bank visit? You might want to reschedule, as banks are set for a four-day holiday, beginning from January 23 till January 26. Keeping track of bank holidays is crucial for customers to plan their finances in advance and avoid last-minute inconvenience.It is important to note that banks in India follow a combination of national and state-specific holidays, which means branch closures may vary from one state to another. Here's a list of when and where will banks remain closed for rest of January:Banks will remain shut in Tripura, Odisha and West Bengal on account of the Birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Saraswati Puja (Shree Panchami), Vir Surendrasai Jayanti and Basanta Panchami.Banks will remain closed as it is the fourth Saturday of the month.

Trey Yesavage celebrates Taylor Frick’s first birthday after engagement with a heartfelt post

Trey Yesavage shared a soft, romantic moment with fans this weekend. The Toronto Blue Jays pitcher posted a loving message for his fiancée, Taylor Frick, on her birthday. It was her first birthday since the couple got engaged. The post quickly caught attention across social media because of its simple and heartfelt words.The message came only a few months after their engagement in November. That same month, the couple also moved in together. While Trey Yesavage’s baseball career keeps rising, his personal life is also moving fast, and fans are enjoying this new chapter with him.On Sunday, Trey Yesavage shared an Instagram story to mark Taylor Frick’s 24th birthday. He posted a photo of the two of them and wrote a short message that many fans found very touching.“Happy Birthday to my love, another year of making memories with you. I love you,” Trey Yesavage wrote.Taylor Frick later reshared the story on her own Instagram, adding heart emojis. The small exchange showed how close the couple is and how excited they are about their future together.Trey Yesavage proposed to Taylor Frick in November, near the end of last year.The engagement came after a big second half of the 2025 season, when he impressed many people with his pitching.According to reports, the couple has been together for several years but first went public with their relationship in 2023.In October, one month before the proposal, Trey Yesavage had already spoken openly about their bond.He shared an anniversary post and wrote, “Happy anniversary to the woman that completes me! You are my best friend. You know how to always put a smile on my face. You fill my life with love and I’m so thankful for you.”Those words, and now the birthday post, show a softer side of the young pitcher that fans don’t always see on the field.While his personal life is full of happy moments, Trey Yesavage is also getting strong respect for his baseball work. In September 2025, the Toronto Blue Jays moved him up to the senior team.Even in limited time, he made an impact, including during the postseason and the World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers.Former MLB relief pitcher Trevor May spoke about him on Instagram. “I think Trey Yesavage is a very good No. 2,” May said. He added that Yesavage’s ceiling reminds him of Kevin Gausman, pointing to similar pitch styles and movement.Even after the Blue Jays signed Dylan Cease this offseason, many insiders believe Trey Yesavage will stay an important part of the rotation next season because of his control, calm mindset, and steady growth.","Trey yesavage posted a heartfelt message for his fiancée on her birthday.

‘Spent $3.25 million hiring H-1B workers’: Texas university draws backlash over foreign hiring and claims of ‘importing labour’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/spent-3-25-million-hiring-h-1b-workers-texas-university-draws-backlash-over-foreign-hiring-and-claims-of-importing-labour/articleshow/127509480.cms,"Texas A&M sponsored 659 H-1B workers since 2020

H-1B Visa Shake-Up Fuels Anti-Indian Campaigns as Donald Trump's Policy Reshapes US Hiring

Supporters say H-1B hiring supports research and innovation





Texas A&M University is facing backlash after fresh claims that the public university spent around $3.25 million on H-1B visa fees and related immigration costs between 2020 and late November 2025, sponsoring hundreds of foreign workers for a wide range of roles. The figures have sparked criticism online, with some questioning whether the institution is relying too heavily on overseas recruitment at a time when graduate job opportunities, particularly in tech, remain under pressure. Supporters, however, say H-1B hiring is often used by major universities to fill specialised roles, keep research moving, and prevent staffing disruptions across teaching and technical operations.According to The Dallas Express, which cited USCIS records, Texas A&M had 659 H-1B beneficiaries approved from 2020 through September 2025, the most recent period referenced in the data.The story also pointed to the wider Texas A&M System, claiming approvals across affiliated entities exceeded 1,400. The spending total was reported as $3,252,339.17, covering visa-related costs across different stages of the process, including processing and sponsorship fees.The controversy is not just about money, but also about the types of jobs linked to the filings. The records cited included instructional roles as well as non-teaching positions such as Graphic Designer II, Communications Manager, and software application developer.Some job postings referenced standard qualification requirements, including a bachelor’s degree and several years of experience. Supporters argue that in large university systems, many of these roles support ongoing programmes, labs, and campus operations, where stability and specific technical experience can matter as much as academic credentials.The spending has also been contrasted with hiring at the University of Texas at Dallas, which was cited as spending about $1.1 million to sponsor roughly 300 H-1B workers over a similar period.Critics have taken this as evidence that Texas A&M is relying more heavily on foreign hiring, while others note that differences in size, staffing needs, and institutional structure can significantly shape both the number of visas and the overall cost.The debate has intensified amid wider concerns about the job market for young tech workers. A 2025 estimate from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York cited in the coverage reported 6.1% unemployment and 16.5% underemployment among computer science graduates.Even so, higher education advocates argue that H-1B hiring does not always clash with graduate hiring, particularly when roles require specialised experience or when staffing supports research and teaching systems that benefit students.While the backlash has been loud, supporters of the programme argue it remains a key hiring pathway for universities, especially for roles that sustain research output, strengthen academic programmes, and maintain competitiveness for funding and talent.The American Association of University Professors has defended H-1B as an important route for attracting skilled professionals into the US workforce, particularly in areas where institutions struggle to fill roles quickly through domestic hiring alone.The Dallas Express report said the records were released after delays and referenced a pending complaint with the Texas Attorney General. For now, the story has become another flashpoint in the broader debate over immigration hiring, graduate employment pressures, and transparency at publicly funded institutions.","Texas a&m sponsored 659 h-1b workers since 2020.

Big shift for a protected auto market

Trade boost amid global tariff pressures

‘Mother of all deals’ nearing conclusion

India is planning a major reduction in import tariffs on cars from the European Union, cutting duties to 40 per cent from levels as high as 110 per cent, in what would be the country’s biggest opening yet of its closely guarded automobile market.The move comes as New Delhi and Brussels close in on a long-awaited free trade agreement (FTA), which could be announced as early as Tuesday.According to sources briefed on the talks, the Modi government has agreed to immediately lower import taxes on a limited number of cars from the 27-nation EU with an import price above 15,000 euros, news agency Reuters reported.Over time, these duties could be reduced further to 10 per cent, significantly easing access to the Indian market for European automakers such as Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz and BMW.India currently levies import duties of 70 per cent to 110 per cent on foreign cars, a policy often criticised by global auto executives, including Tesla CEO Elon Musk.Under the proposal, New Delhi has offered to slash duties to 40 per cent immediately for around 200,000 combustion-engine cars annually, as per Reuters, marking its most aggressive move yet to open up the sector.Battery electric vehicles will be excluded from duty cuts for the first five years to protect domestic players such as Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra, after which similar reductions could apply.Lower tariffs would benefit European manufacturers, whose share of India’s 4.4-million-unit annual car market remains under 4 per cent.With the market expected to grow to six million units by 2030, the proposed cuts could allow automakers to test demand with imported models before committing to deeper local manufacturing investments.The broader FTA is expected to significantly expand bilateral trade and help Indian exporters offset the impact of steep US tariffs.The EU is already India’s largest trading partner in goods, with bilateral trade valued at $136.53 billion in 2024–25, while services trade stood at over $83 billion.The deal is also seen as a strategic step to diversify supply chains and reduce dependence on China amid shifting global trade dynamics.India and the EU are expected to announce the conclusion of negotiations for the FTA this week, a pact that commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal has dubbed the “mother of all deals”.Talks for the agreement began in 2007 and are now nearing the finish line after nearly 18 years. The announcement is expected during the India-EU Summit on January 27, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi set to hold talks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and European Council President Antonio Costa.",India is planning a major reduction in import tariffs on cars from the european union.

Refund adjustments: Prevent tax refunds from being offset against demands that have already been stayed.

Ahead of the Union Budget 2026, the IT industry association Nasscom has urged the government to address pressing tax concerns for startups and technology firms. As reported by PTI, the Nasscom wishlist for Budget 2026 includes extending the Employee Stock Option Plan (ESOP) tax deferment to more startups, clarifying rules around the tax treatment of foreign cloud providers using Indian data centers.As per the report, Nasscom has asked for ESOP tax deferment to be extended to all DPIIT-recognised startups and it should not be limited to just the ones certified by the Inter-Ministerial Board. Presently, fewer than 4,000 startups qualify for 2020 ESOP deferment window, out of the 1.59 lakh recognised by DPIIT. “ESOPs enable startups to attract high-quality talent. Extending deferment will make the regime meaningful and help them compete with larger businesses,” Nasscom said in its pre-Budget memorandum.Along with this, the association also wants ESOP costs to be deductible under section 37 of the Income Tax Act, making equity-based compensation more viable for young companies.Cloud Tax clarityThe report further states that Nasscom has also asked for explicit clarification on hosting or co-location services from Indian data centre operators and does not create a permanent establishment for foreign cloud providers. The group argues that arm’s-length payments to Indian operators fully cover India-based functions, and foreign providers neither control premises nor conduct business locally.This clarification, Nasscom said, is crucial to avoid unintended tax liabilities that could discourage global cloud providers from expanding operations in India.Other key recommendations","The it industry association nasscom has urged the government to address pressing tax concerns for startups and technology firms.

MrBeast samples cultivated chicken at California food tech facility

$1 vs $1,000,000,000 Futuristic Tech!





When the world’s most influential YouTuber steps into a food lab, the impact stretches far beyond the tasting table. This week, a quiet visit to a California facility created loud ripples across the alternative protein world. Millions of young viewers who shape online culture watched something unfamiliar become approachable in real time.What made the moment stand out was not hype or spectacle. It was normalisation. Seeing a creator known for viral challenges and generosity calmly learn how meat can be grown from cells reframed a long-running debate. Cultivated meat was no longer presented as a futuristic theory. It looked edible, curious, and surprisingly ordinary.MrBeast, whose audience spans Gen Z and Gen Alpha, visited the EPIC facility operated by Upside Foods. During the visit, he watched cultivated chicken being produced and tasted the final product on camera. For an industry often boxed into climate reports and regulatory headlines, the cultural exposure mattered.Upside Foods founder Uma Valeti captured the philosophy behind the visit in a simple line that quickly resonated online. “What if we can have the best of both worlds… LOVE chicken and LOVE chickens!”Cultivated meat has spent years fighting labels like artificial or lab-made.Those narratives thrive on distance and misunderstanding. A creator-led moment does the opposite. It invites audiences inside the process without lectures or fear-based messaging. Viewers see curiosity instead of caution.For Upside Foods, the timing is critical. The company has faced the same pressures hitting the wider sector. High costs, political resistance, and investor anxiety have slowed momentum. At the same time, it remains the first cultivated meat company to receive US regulatory approval and one of the most closely watched players in the field.Industry voices have already described the visit as a cultural turning point. Not because it solves scaling or policy hurdles, but because it shifts perception. If even a small fraction of MrBeast’s audience begins to see cultivated meat as normal food rather than experimental science, the ripple effect reaches restaurants, retailers, and regulators.In food innovation, technology builds products. Culture builds demand. This moment sat squarely at that intersection.","Mrbeast brought cultivated meat into the mainstream after tasting cell-based chicken at upside foods’ california facility.

Jensen Huang explains why AI changes tasks, not the purpose of jobs

AI-Powered Future: Next Gen Careers You Should Watch

AI did not replace radiologists it made them more in demand

AI helps Jensen Huang type less, but think more

Software engineering and hiring growth

Legal and service industries adapt

Redesigning work, not removing it

A shift in how work is done





People are getting more and more worried about losing their jobs as AI becomes more common in the workplace. Many workers are worried that machines could completely take over human jobs, from offices to hospitals. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, thinks this fear misses an important point. Speaking on the No Priors podcast, Huang offered a calm and practical view of how AI is actually changing the workplace. He says that AI is not taking away the purpose of jobs. It's not changing the jobs themselves; it's changing how some parts of them are done. AI takes care of boring or time-consuming tasks so that people can focus on things that need human judgment, experience, and responsibility. Huang's argument is based on examples from the real world in healthcare, technology, law, and even the service industry.One of the main things Jensen Huang talked about was the difference between tasks and goals. People do tasks every day, like typing reports, looking over documents, or scanning pictures. Purpose is the reason the job exists in the first place.Huang explained that AI is very good at handling tasks, especially those that are repetitive or rule-based.However, it does not replace the core purpose of a role. In many cases, removing these smaller tasks allows professionals to do their jobs better and on a larger scale.Radiology is often cited as a field that AI would disrupt or shrink. Years ago, some experts predicted that automated image analysis would reduce the need for radiologists. Huang pointed out that the opposite has happened.Recent data shows that in 2025, diagnostic radiology residency programs offered 1,208 positions, a 4 percent increase compared to the previous year. Radiology has also become the second-highest-paid medical speciality, with average incomes reaching $520,000. This marks a 48 percent increase since 2015.AI now helps radiologists read scans faster and more accurately. But the core responsibility, diagnosing disease and guiding treatment, still depends on human expertise. Because hospitals can now process more cases, they earn more revenue and hire more specialists.Huang used his own role to explain the idea further. He said much of his day is spent typing, reviewing information, and communicating. AI tools that help automate writing or summarising tasks save him time.However, he made it clear that this has not reduced his workload. Instead, it allows him to handle more responsibilities. AI takes away the stress of smaller tasks, which helps him focus on making decisions, planning, and leading.AI is also having a big effect on software development. AI tools can now write code, find bugs, and speed up the development process. Some assume this means fewer engineers are needed.Huang rejected this view. At Nvidia, the company continues to hire engineers even as AI tools become more capable. Faster development means more projects can be taken on. That, in turn, creates demand for skilled people who can design systems, solve problems, and guide long-term technical direction.The legal profession is also changing. AI can quickly review documents and search through large volumes of data. Still, lawyers remain essential for protecting clients, resolving disputes, and applying judgment in complex situations.Huang also spoke about service jobs, such as restaurants. Even if AI takes over tasks like order-taking or delivery, the purpose of the job remains unchanged. The goal is still to make customers happy. People who work adapt by focusing more on personal interaction, problem-solving, and the quality of service.Huang's main point is that AI doesn't take jobs away; it changes the way people do them. The most affected are jobs that require you to do the same things over and over. Jobs that require results, care, creativity, and responsibility still need people.AI is a tool that helps workers get more done. It helps businesses serve more customers, patients, or users by making them more productive, which usually means they hire more people.AI is changing how work is done instead of taking jobs away. It clears up bottlenecks, makes everyday tasks go faster, and gives professionals more time to focus on what's really important. Huang says that in the future, work won't be about fighting AI. Instead, it will be about figuring out how to use it to get better results while keeping people at the center.","Jensen huang explains why ai changes tasks, not the purpose of jobs. Ai takes care of boring or time-consuming tasks so that people can focus on things that need human judgment, experience, and responsibility.

BENGALURU: Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, India's second astronaut and the first from the country to have stayed aboard the International Space Station (ISS), has termed the Ashok Chakra - India's highest peacetime military decoration - as a collective blessing from the people of India.After the formal announcement on Sunday, Shux, as he is fondly known among colleagues, told TOI: ""I feel immensely proud and deeply grateful for the honour conferred upon me. When I embarked on this journey [as an astronaut], I did so as a representative of every Indian. Today, as I receive this recognition, I experience it as a collective blessing from the people of India. I am truly humbled by this award.""At the same time, he said, the honour brought with it a renewed and heightened sense of responsibility. ""...My journey must translate into meaningful and tangible outcomes, particularly in advancing our future human space missions. I remain firmly committed to ensuring that the opportunity I was given-to journey into space from Bharat-opens the door for many more such opportunities in the years ahead.""He extended his gratitude for the goodwill and support he has received, and said: ""...I express my heartfelt gratitude to the Government of India for bestowing this prestigious honour upon me.""Wing Commander (retd) Rakesh Sharma, India's first astronaut to have travelled to space (April 1984) had also received an Ashok Chakra for his mission with the Soviets. Isro chairman V Narayanan told TOI, on Sunday: ""I am proud that my colleague is getting this award and I thank the govt and the PM for it. This recognition is important not only to Shukla but also for India's human space programme, which will see many more astronauts in the coming years, in line with the govt's vision."" Shux was aboard the ISS in mid-2025, the year that marked 25 years of continuous human presence on the multinational platform in space. In his first full-fledged exclusive interview in Nov 2025, when ISS achieved this milestone, he had told TOI the space station showed what can happen when long-term engineering goals align with cooperation.""...During my mission, we had 11 crew members from six countries working on more than 60 experiments. We also spoke to students worldwide. Those 20 days showed how a platform built with 1990s technology still supports new science and joint work. ISS stands for continuity, shared goals, and a way of working that keeps people focused on the task, not the boundaries on Earth,"" Shux had said.",Group captain shubhanshu shukla gets ashoka chakra; 70 gallantry awards announced.

Merge Labs vs Neuralink





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has announced an investment in Merge Labs, a brain-computer interface (BCI) startup which was founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Rival to Elon Musk ’s Neuralink, the mission of Merge Labs is to develop safe and scaleable brain-computer interfaces. “We are excited to support and collaborate with Merge Labs as they turn an ambitious idea into reality and ultimately products that are useful for people,” said the company.OpenAI revealed that funding made by the company will support Merge Labs’ mission of creating safe, scalable brain-computer interfaces that could one day allow humans to interact with artificial intelligence directly through neural signals. The company has not yet disclosed the size of the investment, but the partnership underscores OpenAI’s growing interest in technologies that extend beyond software into hardware and human augmentation.Merge Labs is a research lab with the long-term mission of bridging biological and artificial intelligence to maximize human ability, agency, and experience. It is developing fundamentally new approaches⁠ (opens in a new window) to BCIs that are safe and interface with the brain at much higher bandwidth by combining biology, devices, and AI.The company is focused on creating non-invasive neural interfaces that can translate brain activity into digital commands. Unlike more invasive approaches that require surgical implants, Merge Labs aims to build consumer-ready devices that are both accessible and ethically designed.The company’s early prototypes reportedly use advanced sensors and machine learning models to interpret neural signals, with potential applications ranging from medical rehabilitation to enhanced productivity tools.Elon Musk founded Neuralink in 2016 and till now the company has made significant progress in developing brain implants which enable people with paralysis to control devices with the help of their thoughts. The Elon Musk-owned company recently raised $600 million at a $9 billion valuation and is conducting human trials.Merge Labs on the other hand, is reportedly working on less invasive brain interfaces with a strong emphasis on AI-powered enhancements. The focus of the startup is not just medical rehabilitation but broader human-AI integration.“I believe the merge has already started,” Altman wrote in a 2017 blog post. “We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants”.","Merge labs is a brain-computer interface (bci) startup founded by openai ceo sam altman.

Satya Nadella says competition is 'keeping us fit'

CEO Satya Nadella says Microsoft avoiding the 'Zero-Sum' trap





During a wide-ranging discussion at the World Economic Forum 2026, Nadella said that while the competition with fellow tech giants like Google, Meta and other is fiercer than ever, the expanding role of technology in the global economy makes this a “blessed” time for the industry. His comments came amid a “pretty intense” era led by artificial intelligence (AI) and shifting global markets.“It's a pretty intense time. I mean, so the way I always think is, it's always helpful. When you have a complete new set of competitors every decade, because that keeps you fit,” Nadella said. Reflecting on his 34-year journey at Microsoft, Nadella dismissed the idea that the AI race is a zero-sum game, instead pointing to a future where tech’s share of the world's GDP will only continue to rise.Nadella highlighted that Microsoft’s longevity is rooted in its ability to adapt to new “existential” rivals every decade. He recalled joining the company in 1992 when the primary threat was Novell, further noting that the competition has now changed with its AI rivals“If you think about it, I joined Microsoft in 92 when I had Novell as the big existential competitor. Here we are in 2026, it's a pretty intense time. I'm glad there's the competition.It's, quite honestly, at the end of the day, when I look at it right as a percentage of GDP five years from now, where will Tech be right? It will be higher, so we're blessed to be in this industry,” the Microsoft CEO added.While there is a narrative that there’s a winner-takes-all scenario, Nadella insisted that the Total Addressable Market (TAM) tells a different story.“It's a lot of intense competition, but it's not so zero-sum, as some people make it out. Oh, it's getting much bigger, much more. The TAM and it’s just the impact of the stack is going to be so,” Nadella noted.While taking about customer intent, Nadella argued that the key to survival is understanding the “brand permission” a company has with its users.“The question that I always go back to is what’s the brand identity that Microsoft has and the brand permission we have, what customers expect from us,” Nadella noted.","Microsoft ceo satya nadella spoke at the world economic forum 2026.

Artificial intelligence is no longer something people only argue about in tech conferences or future forecasts. It is already quietly shaping daily life in profound and often unexpected ways. From customer support chats to recommendation engines, from coding tools to medical research, AI is now part of how work gets done efficiently. And according to Bill Gates , the pace of change is about to speed up even more dramatically.In his latest annual letter, The Year Ahead, the Microsoft co-founder lays out a clear message. AI will reshape society, economies, and jobs faster than most people expect. Gates says he remains optimistic about technology, but this time his optimism comes with serious warnings. The benefits are real. So are the risks. And ignoring either would be a grave mistake.Gates has spent decades watching technology alter economies and daily life. In his letter, he says AI is different from past waves of innovation. Not just faster, but broader. He argues that artificial intelligence could affect more parts of society than any previous human-made tool.He points to progress already happening. AI is accelerating disease research, improving climate modelling, and expanding access to digital education.Tasks that once took years can now be completed in months, sometimes weeks. For Gates, this is proof that AI can solve hard problems if used well.But he also stresses that hope alone is not a strategy. Institutions, governments, and workers are not fully prepared for how quickly these changes are arriving. Without planning, the speed of AI adoption could leave many people behind.One of Gates’ biggest concerns is how AI could be misused. As advanced tools become more accessible, the barrier to harmful use drops. He has warned that open-source AI systems could be exploited by bad actors, including non-state groups.In particular, Gates has raised alarms about biological threats. He suggests that AI-assisted misuse could pose risks even greater than naturally occurring pandemics. That is not a casual statement. It reflects a growing fear among researchers that powerful tools, in the wrong hands, could scale harm faster than ever before.Gates argues that global cooperation is essential. Clear rules, oversight, and governance structures are needed. At the same time, he acknowledges the tension. Too many restrictions could slow beneficial innovation. Too little could invite danger. Finding the balance will not be easy.Jobs sit at the centre of Gates’ warning. He says AI makes it possible to produce more goods and services with less human labour. That reality will change how companies hire and how work is valued.Some of this is already visible. In software development, AI tools help programmers write, test, and maintain code faster. Gates notes that developers can now be significantly more productive, which lowers costs and reshapes team structures.He also points to sectors like warehouse operations and phone-based customer service. As AI systems improve, these roles are likely to face pressure. Automation will not arrive all at once, but it will arrive steadily.Gates does not frame this as doom. He frames it as a disruption that needs preparation.Beyond job losses, Bill Gates talks about how work itself might change. If AI boosts productivity enough, shorter workweeks could become possible. The same output, fewer hours. It sounds appealing. But he is careful not to present it as automatic.Whether these gains benefit most people depends on policy choices. Who owns the productivity gains. How companies share them. Without thoughtful decisions, Gates warns that efficiency could concentrate wealth instead of spreading it.This is where governments and institutions matter. AI alone will not deliver fairness. People have to decide what to do with the gains it creates.","Gates says he remains optimistic about technology, but this time his optimism comes with serious warnings.

ICICIBC continues to leverage its strong retail and corporate franchise, disciplined risk management, and superior operating metrics. With leadership continuity under Mr. Sandeep Bakhshi, the bank is well positioned to sustain healthy loan growth momentum and deliver best-in-class profitability across cycles. 3QFY26 PAT declined 4% YoY to INR113.2b, missing estimates due to one-off INR12.8b agri-related provisions.Core performance was steady, with NII, PPoP, margins, and asset quality in line, while credit trends in unsecured portfolios showed improvement. Despite one-off provisions, ICICIBC is on track to deliver ~2.2% RoA in FY26E, improving to ~2.3% over FY27–28E. We fine-tune estimates and model FY27E RoA/RoE of 2.3%/16.1%, reiterating ICICIBC as a top BUY.Tata Steel is well placed to benefit from improving steel realizations, operating efficiencies, and robust domestic demand. While global tariff-related uncertainties may weigh in the near term, sustained strength in India and improving Europe performance support long-term earnings visibility. The acquisition of a 50.01% stake in Thriveni Pellets provides Tata Steel access to 4mtpa pellet capacity and a 212km slurry pipeline.This strengthens backward integration, supports upcoming expansions, and mitigates risks from expiring iron-ore leases by FY30.Tata Steel is entering a multi-year expansion across long, flat, and downstream products.
