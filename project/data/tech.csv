The incident, which quickly gained traction on social media, has sparked a wave of humorous reactions and criticism directed at the airline.Pradeep Muthu, a cricket commentator, took to X to share his experience, posting photos of his seat showing a solid wall panel where a window was expected. ""Dei @IndiGo6E I paid for a window seat. Where is the window?"" Muthu quipped in his viral tweet, which has garnered over 903.6K views.Social media users were quick to join the conversation, with many sharing similar experiences. Jokes flooded the comments, with suggestions like rebranding such seats as ""wall seats"" to avoid misleading passengers.One user remarked, ""Most international airlines usually inform beforehand if the window seat has no window. IndiGo should do better here."" Another joked, ""You should carry a drill machine and hammer; make them your own. They are developing our skills."" Others added lighthearted comments like, ""Window closed for the day,"" and ""They want you to draw a window with the pink highlighter on your shirt.""While the internet had its fun, some users criticised IndiGo for a lack of transparency, arguing that passengers should be informed about seat configurations during booking. Responding to Muthu's tweet, IndiGo requested his flight details via direct message to address his concerns, but the airline has yet to issue an official statement on the matter.","Pradeep muthu, a cricket commentator, took to x to share his experience.

"Steep hike on cards for RC renewal of cars, 2-wheelers older than 20 years",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/steep-hike-on-cards-for-rc-renewal-of-cars-2-wheelers-older-than-20-years/articleshow/118128532.cms,"NEW DELHI: Keeping your vehicles beyond 20 years is going to cost you more as the road transport ministry has issued a draft notification proposing a steep hike in renewal of their registration. The move is aimed at disincentivising people to keep vehicles that were manufactured before the BS-II emission norms came into force. The ministry has proposed that renewal of registration of over 20-year-old motorcycles and cars would cost Rs 2,000 and Rs 10,000 respectively.With focus on phasing out commercial medium and heavy vehicles that are over 15 years old, the draft rule has proposed renewal fees to Rs 12,000 and Rs 18,000 respectively. For renewing registration of such vehicles over 20 years would be doubled to Rs 24,000 and Rs 36,000 respectively.While the proposed changes would impact vehicle owners across the country, this will have no effect in Delhi-NCR where it's mandatory to scrap 10-year-old diesel and 15-year-old petrol vehicles because of the court's order.The road transport ministry in October 2021 had increased the registration and renewal fee of motorcycles, three-wheelers and cars, but had left out medium and heavy passenger and goods vehicles. ""We have not touched the renewal fees for private vehicles after they complete 15 years. While we have proposed revised fees for 15-year-old commercial vehicles, we have sought to increase the renewal charge for the ones which were registered 20 years back,"" said a transport ministry official.Similarly, the ministry has proposed to double the fee for fitness tests of both private commercial vehicles that are over 20 years old.All India Motor Transport Congress said it has opposed ""sudden and excessive hike"" in the fitness test fees. It said the fee for fitness test ranged between Rs 500 and Rs 1,500 for most vehicles, with heavy transport vehicles paying a maximum of Rs 3,000. But in the draft notification, it has been more than doubled, with commercial motorcycles now requiring to pay Rs 1,000 for 8-15 year old and Rs 2,000 after 15 years. Similarly, fitness tests for three-wheelers and heavy vehicles have been proposed between Rs 7,000 and Rs 25,000.

""CCS will take up the Rafale-M deal after the PM returns from France-US trip. The cost negotiations for Scorpenes took a little longer because MDL had originally quoted a high price. The aim is to ink both deals before this fiscal ends on March 31,"" a source said.The two countries are also discussing a possible collaboration between French major Safran, which already makes helicopter engines in India, and DRDO to co-develop the 110 kilonewton jet engine for the Indian fifth-generation stealth fighter project, AMCA (advanced medium combat aircraft). But that is in the future. The impending government-to-government Rafale-M deal includes weapons, simulators, crew training and five-year performance-based logistics support as well as spares for the 36 Rafales already inducted by IAF under the Rs 59,000 crore contract in Sept 2016.The 26 Rafale-M jets manufactured by Dassault Aviation, with ""specific enhancements"" to operate from the deck of indigenous aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, will be delivered in 37 to 65 months after inking of the contract. ""The new inter-governmental agreement mirrors the one inked in the IAF deal. All jets are to be delivered by 2030-31,"" a source said.The first of the three additional Scorpenes, in turn, will roll out of MDL in six years, followed by the other two at intervals of a year each, after the contract is inked. The deal's cost does not yet include the price of fitting them with the fuel cell-based air-independent propulsion (AIP) developed by DRDO for greater underwater endurance.The three new Scorpenes will have ""some design modifications and improvements"" over the first six such Kalvari-class vessels constructed at MDL for over Rs 23,000 crore.

Axis Securities has a ‘buy’ recommendation on Bharti Airtel with a target price of Rs 1,900 (+12%) after the telecom services major gave a stellar performance during Oct-Dec quarter. Analysts said that the company's digital portfolio is gaining momentum along with market share gains, it maintained a substantial share of 4G/5G net ads in the market. The company’s ARPU continues to be the best in the industry, and average data usage per customer stands healthy at 24.5 GB/month.ICICI Securities has maintained its ‘buy’ recommendation on Mahindra & Mahindra with a higher target price of Rs 3,680 (+17%) from Rs 3,400 earlier. Analysts expect M&M to continue its strong performance led by its robust UV portfolio, market share gains in both SUV and tractors, improving margin trajectory, and better outlook in the farm equipment segment.Emkay Global Financial Services has retained its ‘buy’ recommendation on Hero MotoCorp with a target price of Rs 5,600 (+33%). Analysts feel the company has shown strong operating performance and the risk-reward is attractive. Management maintains its double-digit revenue growth guidance for FY25 with similar growth in FY26 as well.

The company’s revenue growth so far in FY25 has been a mixed bag with the Part Truck Load segment up 25% while the express segment up by a mere 5%. eCommerce demand had slowed, competition from qCommerce and insourcing from platforms dragged the growth rates in the express.

Analysts feel the company is outstripping industry demand and expanding to retain market share. They said that as the market leader, Star Cement’s Oct-Dec volume growth outstripped north-eastern demand growth, but its operational performance was hit by the delayed Meghalaya clinker stabilisation, higher maintenance shut down cost, higher freight on a highway being constructed, etc.","Axis securities has a ‘buy’ recommendation on bharti airtel with a target price of rs 1,900 (+12%) analysts said that the company’s arpu continues to be the best in the industry, and average data usage per customer stands healthy at 24.5 gb/month.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118131183,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-992830,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

The UK government is planning to digitise property sales data to speed up home purchases and reduce delays, The Guardian reports.A 12-week initiative has been launched to create standardised rules for data sharing among conveyancers, lenders, and others involved in transactions.Currently, much of the process relies on paper documents or outdated systems, causing delays. The changes aim to improve information sharing and make the process more efficient.""We are streamlining the cumbersome homebuying process so that it is fit for the 21st century, helping homebuyers save money, gain time, and reduce stress while also cutting the number of house sales that fall through,"" housing and planning minister Matthew Pennycook was quoted as saying, according to The Guardian.The initiative is part of a wider housing reform plan, including changes to planning rules, building 1.5 million homes, and leasehold reforms.Buying a home in the UK typically takes months, with delays caused by conveyancing, property searches, and document retrieval.According to Rightmove, the UK's largest online real estate portal, it takes an average of five months from offer acceptance to moving in.Rightmove CEO Johan Svanstrom explained that this follows an initial two-month period for property selection and offer agreement. He added: ""The current process also contributes to an average of more than one in five home sales falling through, and hopefully a better process can help reduce this as well.""The ministry of housing, communities and local government says full digitalisation will allow instant access to information for mortgage providers and surveyors, with single identity verification.Right now, important documents like building control and highways records are mostly on paper. Delays also happen because there are no standardised protocols for accessing and verifying electronic data.To improve this, the ministry is working with HM Land Registry (HMLR) and experts from the Digital Property Market Steering Group.HMLR will lead 10-month pilot projects with councils to test digital data sharing. Plans also include digital identity verification to speed up transactions.New leasehold legislation taking effect on March 3 will give leaseholders more control over service charge costs and remove their obligation to pay freeholder legal fees for right-to-manage claims.These changes could save leaseholders up to £3,000 on legal costs and reduce landlord obstruction tactics.Pennycook said the reforms will help leaseholders ""more easily and cheaply take control of the buildings they live in and clamp down on unreasonable or extortionate charges.""","The uk government is planning to digitise property sales data to speed up home purchases.

LONDON: Thames Water , which serves 16 million customers in and around London, is seeking court approval for up to 3 billion pounds ($3.7 billion) of emergency funding to prevent the cash-strapped company from falling into government administration.The high court in London began a four-day hearing on the financing package on Monday, with Thames Water facing off against smaller creditors who complain that the deal is too expensive and favors bigger investors. Creditors holding about 90 per cent of the company's debt have already backed the deal.Without the funding, Thames Water will run out of money in March, which could force the government to temporarily nationalize the company. Both the government and Thames Water say water will continue flowing to customers regardless of what happens.Thames Water, which has about 17 billion pounds ($20.9 billion) of debt and has been repeatedly cited for illegal sewage spills, is at the center of a nationwide backlash over rising water bills as Britain seeks to modernize its water and sewage systems to cope with climate change and a growing population.The company has been the focus of criticism from consumers and politicians who say Thames Water created its own problems by paying overly generous dividends to investors and high salaries to executives while failing to invest in pipelines, pumps and reservoirs. Company executives say the fault lies with regulators who kept bills too low for too long, starving the company of the cash it needed to fund improvements.Ofwat, which regulates water companies in England and Wales, in December approved a 35 per cent increase in Thames Water's consumer charges over the next five years. The company argued that bills needed to rise 53 per cent in order to finance needed projects and provide the financial returns necessary to attract investors.The company has until February 18 to appeal the decision.","Thames water is seeking court approval for up to 3 billion pounds ($3.7 billion) of emergency funding.

BEIJING: China's sluggish domestic consumption got a boost over the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday , with travel and retail sales both offering a slight reprieve to a dragging economy facing the prospect of an escalating US trade war.Train stations and airports across the country were jam-packed for weeks as millions returned home for the festive period in an annual migration that is expected to be a record.Official data showed there were 500 million domestic tourist trips during the eight-day holiday period, commerce ministry spokeswoman He Yongqian said Thursday.That's a 5.9 per cent jump from the same period last year, when travel numbers returned to pre-pandemic levels.Meanwhile, sales of ""key retail and catering services nationwide"" were also up, by 4.1 per cent compared to last year, He Yongqian told reporters in Beijing.The government has struggled to get China's billion-strong army of consumers to inject cash into the economy as a prolonged real estate crisis weighs on confidence.But last month, policymakers expanded a subsidy scheme for common household items, from water purifiers and refrigerators to laptops and electric vehicles.During the holiday period, sales of household appliances and communication equipment at ""key monitored retail enterprises"" were up more than 10 percent year-on-year, according to the commerce ministry.China recorded five per cent growth in gross domestic product last year, among the slowest in decades.Beijing will likely look to hit the same goal of ""around five per cent"" in 2025 but that could be hindered by threats of an escalating trade war.At the weekend, US President Donald Trump announced additional tariffs of 10 percent on all Chinese imports, with Beijing hitting back immediately with tariffs of its own, targeting coal and gas.","500 million domestic tourist trips during the eight-day holiday period.

India top market for Swiss watch company Rado,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/india-top-market-for-swiss-watch-company-rado/articleshow/118126603.cms,"NEW DELHI: Chinese pain has become India's gain when it comes to the global operations of Swiss watch maker Rado, a part of the Swatch group. With economic difficulties in China slowing down demand for luxury watches, Rado has enjoyed swift gains in India that has seen the country emerge as the brand's largest single-market in worldwide sales.Adrian Bosshard, Rado's global CEO, said demand in India has been going strong and the company is the biggest player in the $1000-$5000 price category (around Rs 85,000-4,50,000) within the country. ""While there are many markets that are challenged globally, the Indian market is in a good place with a positive outlook,"" he said. ""Even China is in a challenging position right now. On the other hand, we are seeing a momentum in India which is unprecedented.""The company has around 33 stores here (apart from being retailed out of multi-brand sellers), and Bosshard said metros and top towns have been the biggest contributors so far. ""Now, we also see healthy interest for Swiss watches from Tier 2, Tier 3, and even Tier 4 regions.""Indians are buying watches not only locally but even abroad. ""People with Indian roots are buying in Dubai, Australia, UK, US and Canada. The same is true for those travelling for holidays or business, and purchasing in other countries."" And, what is prompting Indians to buy luxury watches, Bosshard said it is fuelled by a relatively younger population with higher disposable incomes.""There is a great momentum in India, as more and more people are passionate about luxury goods. There is a young population and a positive demography here. Also, the education levels of professionals are high and purchasing power is growing.""Rado has been present in the country since the 1950s and Bosshard said it gains from a relatively-stronger sales and service network. ""While we continued to expand here, there are many other brands that ignored this market for long. Also, our local management helps us develop tailor-made solutions when it comes marketing and consumer connect initiatives.""","Rado has enjoyed swift gains in india that has seen the country emerge as the brand's largest single-market in worldwide sales.

Commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal said all the four EFTA nations have moved forward in seeking to implement the agreement. ""With the $100 billion FDI, I believe that we could be catalysing overall investments of may be $400 billion or $500 billion in the Indian ecosystem,"" the minister said, adding that a million direct jobs could be created.The setting up of the dedicated investment desk is seen as an important step and it will be the centralised support mechanism for companies from the EFTA region looking to expand in India. It will provide market insights and regulatory guidance, business match-making and assistance in navigating India's policy and investment landscape. ""It will help businesses from EFTA countries navigate areas of concern and it will make it easier for them to do business in India,"" Goyal told reporters.He also said India has offered EFTA countries an opportunity to have dedicated enclaves in either of the 20 industrial smart cities, being developed by National Industrial Corridor Development Corporation, or in the 100 industrial hub and spoke model areas announced in Budget.

""We have an experienced and committed team in the US which is focused strongly on biosimilars.

We are India's premier biosimilars company and we are making a brand presence in the global markets.

"Amazon reports strong earnings for Q4, but stocks dip due to outlook for the 1st quarter",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/amazon-reports-strong-earnings-for-q4-but-stocks-dip-due-to-outlook-for-the-1st-quarter/articleshow/117998797.cms,"Amazon on Thursday reported better-than-expected revenue and profits for the holiday shopping period, but its stocks dipped in after-hours trading due to disappointing guidance for the current quarter.The Seattle-based e-commerce and technology company said its revenue for the October-December period totaled $187.8 billion, a 10% jump compared to the same period in 2023. Profits came out to $20 billion while earnings per share reached $1.86, higher than the $1.49 that analysts surveyed by FactSet had anticipated.But the company said it expected revenue for the current quarter to be between $151 billion and 155.5 billion, lower than the $158.56 billion that analysts were expecting. The guidance anticipates ""an unusually large, unfavorable impact"" from foreign exchange rates, it said.Amazon is the biggest online shopping destination in the U.S. and has long been a beneficiary of consumer spending during the holidays. As it has done in recent years, the company in October began offering promotions intended to lure early holiday shoppers. It advertised other discounts during the three-month period, including on major sales days such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.Amazon on Thursday reported it saw $75.5 billion in revenue for its online shopping business, up 7% from the same period in 2023.Across the retail industry, holiday sales in November and December were better than expected compared with the previous year as lower inflation on holiday goods enticed shoppers to buy, according to The National Retail Federation. Online shopping also saw record sales levels, Adobe Analytics reported in January.Sales for Amazon Web services, the company's prominent cloud computing unit, rose 19% during the fourth quarter. But it fell slightly below analysts expectations.Amazon is one of the biggest players in the competitive tech race around generative artificial intelligence. Like other tech companies, it has ramped up investments in the technology and is spending billions to expand data centers that support AI and cloud computing. The company is also spending money on other equipment, including its own computer chips and those developed by Nvidia. It has also rolled out its own AI models and integrated the generative AI into other parts of its business.In the fourth quarter, Amazon reported spending $27.8 billion on property and equipment, significantly higher than the same period in 2023. Most of the spending was geared towards AI and AWS, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during a call with analysts on Thursday.""We think virtually every application that we know of today is going to be re-invented with AI inside of it,"" Jassy said. ""I think both our business, our customers and shareholders will be happy medium-to-long term that we're pursuing the capital opportunity and the business opportunity in AI.""Jassy also said during the call that Amazon, like many others, was ""impressed"" by DeepSeek, the Chinese artificial intelligence company whose chatbot recently became the most downloaded app in the U.S.Amazon's quarterly report also comes as the retail industry is absorbing a new 10% tariff President Donald Trump imposed on Chinese imports on Tuesday. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been put on hold for about a month.Trump also thew out a trade exemption that allowed low-value shipments from China to bypass duties, a loophole that had given an advantage to China-founded e-commerce firms, such as Shein and Temu.The new tariffs could benefit Amazon by increasing costs for its competitors. But it would also impact Chinese sellers who connect with American consumers on the company's shopping platform. Furthermore, it could raise prices on a recently-launched online storefront that Amazon set up to ship low-cost products directly from China. The storefront, called Amazon Haul, was Amazon's answer to Shein and Temu.Additionally, analysts from Morgan Stanley wrote in a Monday note that Amazon's first-party retail business, though which the company sells products purchased from manufacturers, has the highest exposure to the tariffs. The analysts estimate 25% of the merchandise sold through that business comes from China.","Amazon reported better-than-expected revenue and profits for the holiday shopping period.
