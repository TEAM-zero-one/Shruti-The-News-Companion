NEW DELHI: National Commission for Women has recommended a comprehensive review of cyber laws relating to women to secure their digital rights, extend privacy protections and hold online platforms accountable.For instance, the NCW report calls for inclusion of cyberbullying, trolling, deepfakes, and privacy violations in the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita 2023 and protects the complainant’s identity in cyber offences. For protecting children it is recommended that digital manipulation and online grooming should be recognised as offences and penalties must be increased under the Protection Of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012.These are part of the over 200 actionable recommendations in the NCW report aimed at addressing the legal and institutional gaps in India’s response to cyber offences. “Through this report, NCW envisions a cyber ecosystem where laws do not merely punish offenders, but protect dignity; where awareness replaces fear; and where every woman can step into the digital world without hesitation,” NCW chairperson Vijaya Rahatkar said.The recommendations compiled following a year-long exercise of consultations with various stakeholders have been submitted to the ministries of law and justice, electronics and information technology, women and child development, and home affairs.For instance in the Information Technology Act 2002, it is recommended to make room for tougher penalties for offences against women and children, penal action for threats to share private or obscene content and a mandatory victim compensation fund.In case of IT Rules 2021, recommendations range from mandatory account verification and inclusion of AI-manipulated imagery and new provisions for gender-based harassment to cross-border content regulation.With regards to the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 it is recommended that “sensitive personal data” and “gender-specific damage” should be defined and there should be stricter consent norms and mandatory removal of non-consensual content within 12 hours. The report also calls for paving the way for tiered penalties for gendered data misuse.To secure women at the workplace under the POSH Act, 2013, it recommended extending protection to digital harassment and remote workplaces. It is also recommended to cover online and OTT content under the Indecent Representation of Women Act, 1986.","National commission for women has recommended a comprehensive review of cyber laws relating to women.

Arthur Kaliyev’s ex-girlfriend traced over $50,000 lost through offshore betting links

The alleged check scam of summer 2023 sits at the center of the case against Arthur Kaliyev

Arthur Kaliyev's off-ice narrative is turning into something that sounds more like a headline than a hockey statistics sheet. The Ottawa Senators forward is now caught in a several accusations that including gambling, deceit, and a confusing financial situation. His ex-girlfriend, model Lauren Mochen, told the New York Post that her three-year relationship with Kaliyev resulted in losses of over $50,000, leading to questions about the true extent of his issues.She talked about bounced checks, bank accounts that closed out of nowhere, and late-night calls that went from arguments to sheer desperation. Although the claims haven't been validated in court and no charges have been brought up, the pattern she outlines seems like a red flag. Issues like gambling, addiction, and financial problems aren't unfamiliar in professional sports, but the depth of her narrative, along with the surrounding silence, has changed one player's personal life into one of the league's most awkward subjects of discussion.Mochen stated that the more than $50,000 loss was part of a recurring issue connected to Kaliyev's gambling. She pointed out that he transitioned financial conversations to Snapchat to use disappearing messages and refused to watch anything but sports on TV, obsessively checking his phone and switching between games, as if he had bets on every result.She told Walker, “He behaved as if he had bets placed on every single game that was on my TV. He would sit there checking his phone, checking and flipping back and forth between games.”In October 2024, while they were in the process of opening a joint account at Chase Bank, a banker informed them that Kaliyev was banned from the main branches. This was due to someone using his Social Security number under his father Vadim Simakov's name to take out loans and credit cards. They opted to open an account at BMO instead, with assistance from Kaliyev's agent, Ian Pulver, to block his parents from accessing it.Kaliyev shared a screenshot showing transactions on sites like Crypto.com and FanDuel, along with an associate who was placing bets on his behalf. Mochen traced PayPal transfers back to Bovada, an offshore betting site that is illegal in the U.S. and California, where they lived most of the time.Mochen asserted that Kaliyev owed roughly $50,000 to his teammates on the Los Angeles Kings for various fines, fees, group bets, and pools, according to a text from his best buddy, Igor Larionov II, who referenced Kings defenseman Drew Doughty. Another player from the Kings confirmed via Snapchat that the debts were still there.In January 2024, just before his waiver, Kings GM Rob Blake held off on processing until Kaliyev cleared his outstanding trainer fees; Kaliyev texted Mochen on January 2, “Stuff like this makes me boil,” owing to cash shortages. Mochen supplied him with cash, channeled through her friend Krissy Spaulding, who confirmed the setup but noted that repayment never occurred. Kaliyev was also allegedly kept out of practice because of unpaid tips.According to Mochen, the discussions about gambling escalated quickly. Following his injury in February 2024, Kaliyev made threats of suicide during lengthy calls that lasted three hours. She and Larionov reached out to Pulver, who noted the possibility of NHL/NHLPA support on March 11, 2024.Mochen proposed the Player Assistance Program on March 14, but Kaliyev turned it down, “No, don’t even start with the program, don’t even start. Please. Just take off the board right now.” He supposedly made physical threats towards her during their arguments, “I’m going to end you, I’m going to hurt you,” though never acted on it.Mochen described the pattern to the Post, “Every single time I brought up gambling, it was a freak-out... He’s screaming at me, ‘I’m a scumbag, I’m f–ked up. He hopes I die. He hopes I get hit by a car.’ Over me just saying, ‘Do you gamble?’”The claims revolve around a scheme that Mochen says Kaliyev orchestrated in the summer of 2023, just about a month before a birthday trip to the Bahamas. Kaliyev supposedly told her he had ""accidentally"" taken money from her PayPal account to pay workers at his family's shipping company, and that his mother, Rumiya Kaliyev, had given him a $400 check to repay her. He sent her a photo of the check, which Mochen deposited via mobile. He claimed his bank account was frozen due to family issues and asked her to send him the $400 through Apple Cash, promising to pay her back shortly.Things got out of hand fast. In the following week, Kaliyev supposedly handed over more checks from the family business $1,500, two checks for $2,300 each, and another for $1,000 adding up to $7,500 and requested Mochen to deposit them and transfer the money online.When Mochen got to Miami for her vacation, she checked her bank account and discovered it was overdrawn by $7,000. Her bank reached out to her, saying the checks were fake and insisting on repayment to prevent her account from being closed.Mochen recounted the panic to the Post: “The bank calls me and says, ‘You cashed three fraudulent checks, who did these come from? Why did you do this?’ And right away, I panicked and was like, ‘No, no, no, I don’t know what’s going on.’ And I was like, ‘Can you guys double check? There’s just no way this is happening.’ The bank was like, ‘No, you need to pay the difference. Your account is negative, and once you do, we’re going to close your accounts. You can’t have an account with us anymore.’”Mochen accused Kaliyev of using her personal details and a different phone number to open another PayPal account, stealing an additional undisclosed sum beyond the $14,114.88 she had tracked from her original account. She provided evidence for her claims through bank statements, text messages, and PayPal records that were examined by the Post.Mochen reported an incident to the police in Saginaw Township, Michigan, concerning larceny tied to the fraud dispute. She told the Post that she is contemplating pressing charges, but as of November 3, 2025, no charges have been made.Also Read: Conor Geekie gets jumped by Hendrix Lapierre and Trevor van Riemsdyk as 3rd period brawl shakes up Capitals vs Lightning showdown","Arthur kaliyev’s ex-girlfriend traced over $50,000 lost through offshore betting links to bovada, an offshore betting site that is illegal in the u.s. and california.

Kayla Nicole reveals the truth behind her viral Halloween video



Behind the Likes and Beyond the Horror Stories with Winter & Chy

More coverage on NFL:

Kayla Nicole has just confessed what everyone knew: it was Taylor all along. After her Halloween costume and video went viral this weekend, the model and i nfl uencer admitted that behind all her efforts was a Taylor—but not the one everyone assumed. The revelation came after a weekend filled with online debates, Swiftie reactions, and speculation linking her video to her ex-boyfriend, NFL star Travis Kelce , and his fiancée, global superstar Taylor Swift Hours before Halloween, Nicole captivated her Instagram followers with a striking recreation of Toni Braxton’s iconic music video, “He Wasn’t Man Enough.” The production was polished, bold, and instantly controversial. Many viewers believed the post was a subtle jab at Kelce and Swift’s relationship. The lyrics—“Don’t you know that he was my man? / But I chose to let him go”—only fueled the fire. To the public, it seemed like a deliberate message aimed at the high-profile couple.Nicole decided to set the record straight during a recent episode of her Pre-Game podcast. “I had a white best friend. Her name was Taylor,” she said. “She had the only house I could go over to as a kid because my mom didn’t play those types of games.”She went on to describe a vivid memory from childhood: “I specifically remember driving home from private school in my uniform in the back of a paddy wagon with Taylor, and her mom was playing this song.”That, Nicole said, was the moment she realized, “Wow, white people listen to Black people’s music as well.”However, not everyone was convinced. The internet reacted swiftly, with many questioning whether Nicole’s explanation was genuine. One user commented, “Like, even if it’s true, some things are just better left unsaid, because it’s starting to feel like harassment.” Another wrote, “Even if she did have a friend named Taylor, that little anecdote had no relevance to anything.”Despite the backlash, Nicole received a surprising nod of approval from Toni Braxton herself, who praised the Halloween tribute. Still, the controversy overshadowed what could have been a pure creative homage.In the age of viral speculation, Nicole’s every move remains under a microscope—especially with Kelce and Swift’s relationship dominating pop culture headlines. Her Halloween post may have been inspired by nostalgia, but it reminded the world that in celebrity life, intention often takes a backseat to perception.","The model and i nfl uencer admitted that behind all her efforts was a taylor.

"Inside India’s voyeur web: 80 CCTV dashboards hacked across 20 states; hospitals, schools, homes streamed to porn channels; 50,000 clips sold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/rajkot/inside-indias-voyeur-web-80-cctv-dashboards-hacked-across-20-states-hospitals-schools-homes-streamed-to-porn-channels-50000-clips-sold/articleshow/125073851.cms,"



RAJKOT: A shocking cybercrime has rocked India’s digital security landscape, with hackers stealing at least 50,000 CCTV clips over nine months from facilities across the country and selling them online for anything between Rs 700 and Rs 4,000 per clip, feeding them into an international porn fetish network for profit.Investigators revealed that 80 CCTV dashboards were compromised, spanning hospitals, schools, corporate offices, factories, cinema halls, and even private residences across cities including Pune, Mumbai, Nashik, Surat, Ahmedabad, Delhi, and more.The scam came to light when teaser clips from Payal Maternity Hospital in Rajkot appeared on YouTube channels like “Megha Mbbs” and “cp monda”, leading customers to Telegram groups where the stolen footage was sold.Officials said the breaches were made possible by default passwords such as “admin123”, enabling hackers to launch automated attacks and collect massive amounts of sensitive footage.Despite the primary arrests being made earlier in 2025, investigators found that these illegally obtained clips were still available on Telegram groups until at least June.Investigators found that many of these CCTV systems still used factory-set passwords like ‘admin123’, which had not been changed during setup.This enabled the hackers to initiate an aggressive and automated assault.An officer from the cybercrime branch in Ahmedabad told TOI: “The primary method used was a ‘brute force attack’ (hackers using a program or bot to try every possible combination of letters and numbers for a lock).” Parit Dhameliya, the lead hacker in the operation, a BCom graduate, employed three different software programs to achieve this.“First, Dhameliya used a website called suIP.biz to obtain the IP addresses (the unique online location) of cameras in Gujarat. These IPs were then fed into a software called ‘Masscan’ which quickly scanned for open ports (the specific digital doorways that allow remote communication).”Next, the attackers used a specialized hacking tool called ‘SWC software’, which can reveal a camera’s ID, password, and IP address once the system is compromised. Using these stolen credentials, another accused, Rohit Sisodiya — later arrested in Delhi and who had posed as a medical laboratory technology diploma holder — accessed the hospital’s cameras through the DMSS application, a tool normally used for legitimate remote viewing.The officer added, “To access this sensitive footage cost around Rs 700 per person, though the highest-demand voyeuristic clips sold for up to Rs. 4,000. Praj Patil, also a NEET aspirant, acted as the financial facilitator, providing his mobile number and bank account to collect subscription payments.”To conceal their location, the attackers relied heavily on international infrastructure, routing their activities through virtual private networks (VPNs) that made their origins appear to be in cities like Bucharest in Romania, and New York in the US.The massive scale of unauthorized access — exceeding 11,000 successful external sessions in total — was meticulously tracked through log files spanning from Jan 2024 through early Dec 2024. The core members, including Prajwal Teli, Praj Patil, and Chandraprakash Phoolchand, were arrested within 39 hours of the FIR being registered. The threat actors were charged under several sections of the BNS Act and IT Act, including cyber terrorism.","Investigators revealed that 80 cctv dashboards were compromised, spanning hospitals, schools, corporate offices, factories, cinema halls, and even private residences.

China has shut Nvidia out

Nvidia Makes History: First Company to Hit $4 Trillion Market Cap

Nvidia CEO praises Donald Trump





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang came to Washington with a message for the Donald Trump administration. Speaking at he first Nvidia developers' conference, Nvidia CEO cautioned the US government that America cannot win the AI battle if the world, if China fully excludes Nvidia from its vast developer ecosystem. Highlighting Beijing's effective shutdown of Nvidia's operations in the world's second-largest economy, Huang urged US policymakers to reconsider restrictions that could result in Nvidia cede half the planet's AI talent to domestic rivals.""They've made it very clear that they don't want Nvidia to be there right now,"" Huang said at a news conference during the GTC event, revealing that Nvidia has not even applied for U.S. export licenses for its latest chips to China due to the hostile stance from Beijing. ""I hope that will change in the future because I think China is a very important market."" He argued that a policy isolating America from China's developers ""hurts us more"" in the long term, potentially squandering Nvidia's role in powering global AI infrastructure.This is not the first time that Jensen Huang has spoken about the company's falling market share in China.Speaking at a Citadel Securities event in New York earlier this month, Huang revealed that Nvidia is completely barred from selling its high-performance AI chips, including the A100, H100, and H200 models, to Chinese companies since restrictions began in 2022. He said that he has seen Nvidia's dominance in China’s advanced chip market vanish, with its market share dropping from 95% to Zero due to stringent US export controls.Despite the Chinese blockade -- exacerbated by the US export controls that have changed under successive US administrations -- Nvidia reported $500 billion in bookings for advanced chips and announced seven new supercomputers for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The largest, built with Oracle and featuring 100,000 Blackwell chips, will support nuclear weapons maintenance, fusion energy research, and other national priorities.Jensen Huang credited Trump's ""America First"" policies with revitalizing U.S. manufacturing, noting Nvidia's chip production in Arizona via TSMC, server assembly in Texas, and networking gear in California. ""Putting the weight of the nation behind pro-energy growth completely changed the game,"" he said, thanking Trump directly.The DOE deals underscore Nvidia's pivot to fortified US ties amid China's rejection. Analyst Blake Anderson of Carson Group estimated one supercomputer, ""Solstice,"" could involve $3–4 billion in Nvidia chips alone, though federal discounts may apply from the standard $30,000–$40,000 per Blackwell unit. Huang balanced praise for President Trump who is touring Asia ahead of a Thursday meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, where Nvidia's chips may feature prominently -- with pleas for market access.Trump initially tightened export bans on China-specific AI chips in his second term but reversed in July. Huang has long contended that barring Nvidia from ~$50 billion in annual Chinese sales hampers U.S. R&D funding, even as Chinese developers reportedly still prefer Nvidia over mandated Huawei alternatives.Beyond government wins, Huang unveiled expansions to offset China losses: A $1 billion investment for 2.9% stake in Nokia, plus the ""Arc"" product line to boost 6G base station efficiency for millions of sites globally.","China has shut nvidia out of its vast developer ecosystem, ceo jensen huang said.

CEO Satya Nadella bets on Microsoft’s year-long AI transition before expanding workforce again



Microsoft’s cost-cutting strategy delivers record margins as stock climbs above $500







Microsoft will resume hiring after forcing its 228,000-strong workforce through a year-long AI training period, CEO Satya Nadella announced, marking the first clear timeline for ending a hiring freeze that has seen over 15,000 employees cut in 2025 alone.The tech giant laid off 9,000 workers in July—its largest single round of cuts this year—followed by thousands more eliminated in January, May, and June as Nadella pushes employees to ""unlearn and relearn"" their jobs using AI tools before he'll approve new hires. The workforce purge represents a stunning reversal from fiscal 2022, when Microsoft expanded headcount by 22% in a pre-ChatGPT hiring spree.""I will say we will grow our headcount, but the way I look at it is, that headcount we grow will grow with a lot more leverage than the headcount we had pre-AI,"" Nadella told investor Brad Gerstner on the BG2 podcast that aired in early November.Nadella explained that the hiring pause isn't permanent—it's a strategic transition period allowing workers to fundamentally reshape how they perform their roles using AI. Employees need time to integrate tools like Microsoft 365 Copilot and GitHub Copilot into their daily workflows before the company expands again.""It's the unlearning and learning process that I think will take the next year or so, then the headcount growth will come with max leverage,"" he said, comparing the shift to how email and Excel spreadsheets revolutionised workplace productivity decades ago.The CEO shared an example of a Microsoft networking executive who, facing massive data center expansion needs, built AI agents to handle maintenance tasks instead of hiring additional staff. ""That is an example of a team with AI tools being able to get more productivity,"" Nadella noted.Despite the layoffs weighing heavily on Nadella personally—he addressed employee concerns in a July memo—investors have rewarded Microsoft's cost-cutting approach. The stock surged above $500 for the first time in July, and the company recently reported its widest operating margin since 2002 alongside 12% year-over-year revenue growth.Microsoft previously implemented selective hiring freezes in its U.S. consulting division in January 2025 and during the COVID-19 pandemic, though strategic areas like Azure cloud services continued recruiting throughout those periods.The company now expects all work to begin with AI integration. ""Right now, any planning, any execution, starts with AI. You research with AI, you think with AI, you share with your colleagues,"" Nadella explained.","Microsoft will resume hiring after forcing its 228,000-strong workforce through a year-long ai training period.

What Mustafa Suleyman said about AI having emotions





“Our physical experience of pain is something that makes us very sad and feel terrible, but the AI doesn’t feel sad when it experiences ‘pain.’ It’s a very, very important distinction. It’s really just creating the perception, the seeming narrative of experience and of itself and of consciousness, but that is not what it’s actually experiencing.”

“The reason we give people rights today is because we don’t want to harm them, because they suffer.

They have a pain network, and they have preferences which involve avoiding pain. These models don’t have that. It’s just a simulation.”

“They’re not conscious. So it would be absurd to pursue research that investigates that question, because they’re not and they can’t be,”

""not a super useful term""

""for more and more things.""





Microsoft AI chief Mustafa Suleyman has advised developers and researchers to stop pursuing projects that suggest artificial intelligence (AI) is capable of consciousness. He said this, asserting that only biological beings possess this trait and noted that the pursuit is misplaced. In a recent interview with CNBC at the AfroTech Conference, Suleyman said,Suleyman has been a vocal opponent of the prospect of conscious AI, or AI services that could convince humans they are capable of suffering.In 2023, Suleyman co-authored the bookand penned an essay titled,His comments come as the generative AI market, led by companies like OpenAI, pushes toward artificial general intelligence (AGI). Meanwhile, the AI companion market is growing with products from companies including Meta and Elon Musk’s xAI.Highlighting the difference between AI becoming more capable and the idea of it having emotions, Suleyman said:Referring to the theory of biological naturalism, which suggests that consciousness depends on the processes of a living brain, Suleyman explained:Suleyman also highlighted that the science of detecting consciousness is still in its early stages.

How new experiences and self-awareness unlock the brain’s creative power; Steve Jobs reveals



Practical steps to cultivate Steve Jobs’s success skill



Set clear, actionable goals: Writing down a specific goal increases accountability and focus. Jobs believed in clarity of purpose, which fuels direction and innovation.

Try something new regularly: Whether it’s learning a language, volunteering, or exploring a new hobby, novelty keeps the brain engaged.

Network beyond your circle: Talking to people from different backgrounds sparks new perspectives and ideas.

Reflect daily: Take 10 minutes each day to evaluate what you learned, what surprised you, and how it connects to your goals.

The visionary co-founder of Apple, Steve Jobs, over four decades ago, offered a timeless lesson about what truly sets successful people apart. During his 1982 speech at the Academy of Achievement , Jobs challenged the traditional definition of intelligence. He argued that being “smart” isn’t about how much you know or how quickly you think, but it’s about how you connect ideas that others overlook.Jobs believed that true intelligence lies in creativity and perception, not just raw intellect. The ability to connect seemingly unrelated experiences to generate new ideas, products, or perspectives defines innovation. His message still resonates today, especially in a world dominated by artificial intelligence and fast-paced technology, where the ability to think differently remains the ultimate advantage.According to US Chamber of Commerce, in one of his most quoted reflections, Jobs said, “You have to not have the same bag of experiences as everyone else or else you’re going to make the same connections.” This simple yet powerful idea forms the core of creative problem-solving.Jobs explained that people who achieve remarkable success often do so because they have a wide variety of life experiences. These experiences, whether travelling, studying different disciplines, learning new skills, or meeting people from different cultures, act as raw material for innovative thinking.When faced with challenges, such individuals can draw from this mental library to approach problems in unique ways.This concept is sometimes referred to as “cross-disciplinary creativity,” the practice of borrowing ideas from different fields to create new solutions. Jobs himself applied this philosophy throughout his career. His interest in calligraphy, for example, inspired the elegant typography used in Apple’s early computers.Jobs once said that creativity is simply about connecting the dots but to have dots to connect, you must first collect them through diverse life experiences.Modern neuroscience supports Jobs’s belief that diverse experiences stimulate creative intelligence. When the brain encounters new information or environments, it forms new neural pathways. These pathways make it easier to see patterns, link ideas, and think abstractly.People who stay in repetitive routines often fall into mental rigidity, where their thinking becomes predictable and limited. By contrast, those who constantly learn, explore, and experiment develop cognitive flexibility, which enhances creativity and problem-solving abilities. Jobs’s message is therefore more relevant than ever in a rapidly changing world; those who explore beyond their comfort zones adapt faster and outperform those who stay static. Jobs’s approach to creativity also involved deep self-awareness. He understood that the mind’s default mode is to repeat familiar behaviours. To achieve breakthroughs, one must first recognise mental and behavioural patterns that prevent progress.This involves honest reflection: identifying procrastination, fear of failure, or reluctance to take risks. These are the habits that make individuals feel trapped in routine and unable to innovate. Recognising them requires stepping back taking time to observe your life from a distance rather than simply moving through it.In 2019 X (formerly Twitter) post, revealed how the success mantra lesson by Steve Jobs shaped and helped him as a life lesson.To master the skill Steve Jobs described, one must actively seek new and meaningful experiences. Small but consistent steps can reignite creativity and open new neural connections.","Steve jobs on how experiencing different things in life helps you become more creative.

Showing up can be careershaping:

To every woman in technology:





Like many of my peers at the time, I joined the IT industry right out of college, without much exposure to computer science. What made the difference early on were robust learning programmes. Working closely with colleagues and mentors accelerated my learning.Whether building clientserver applications with Oracle and PowerBuilder or working around the clock fixing issues for an inventory management product, hard work was always my mantra. I’ve always believed that if you enjoy what you do, there is no looking back.Specialisation helps create identity: My journey soon evolved into client-facing roles across the globe and building teams and capabilities. These experiences not only helped me deliver large-scale programmes but also paved the way for a faster progression into leadership roles. Over the years, I’ve realised the importance of specialising in a domain or technology, as it helps create a unique identity for yourself and fuels continuous learning and upskilling.As women, balancing career progression with personal lives can be very challenging.Work-life balance is key, not by compromising but with the right support both at work and at home. Creating a robust support ecosystem on the personal front was critical and equally important is the flexibility at work to manage your time and deliver outcomes. It does take extra effort to strike that balance, but when you’re passionate about your work, you truly can have the cake and eat it too.One insight I often share with women in tech: Visibility matters. Technical excellence is essential but so is showing up – taking part in leadership forums, mentoring others, and voicing your perspective in rooms where decisions are made. These are not optional extras; they are career-shaping acts.From starting as an entrylevel trainee to now serving on Cognizant’s executive leadership team, this journey has been made possible by the company’s entrepreneurial culture, which empowers its leaders to take ownership and drive impact. It’s a part of the company’s DNA.Seek out mentors, build your network, and don’t shy away from challenges.

Khadim Batti and Vara Kumar Namburu’s professional journey goes back nearly 25 years. The two first worked together at Huawei Telecom, where they spent a decade building a business intelligence product line – a 2G and 3G platform adopted by several of Huawei’s global customers.“During that time, we gained a lot of experience building large-scale products from scratch. I was managing a team of about 100 engineers, and Vara was the head of technology in my group,” Batti recalls.Around 2010, they mustered the courage to do something of their own. They wanted to build something from India, and not just be building for MNCs. “That thought made us quit and start our own venture,” Batti says.Initially they tried a SaaSbased search engine optimisation (SEO) platform for small & medium enterprises – tools to help them become more visible. But small businesses required too much handholding and Bhatti and Namburu struggled to build a strong customer base. But their product had a ₹fix it’ feature – an inapplication guidance widget – to help their SEO customers, which was popular.That provided Bhatti and Namburu the idea of focusing on the guidance application. And thus was born Whatfix, in 2014. It began as a simple help widget that nudged users to complete tasks.But as the two went deeper into industries like life sciences, insurance, and banking, they realised how complex digital transformation was, and how projects failed due to weak change management. Employees often weren’t adequately trained or empowered to adopt new systems. That led Whatfix to evolve into a comprehensive platform supporting the entire digital transformation journey – from user adoption and usage analytics to simulated training before go-live.Today, Whatfix powers transformation for over 85 of the 500 biggest companies in the world, including Experian, Cardinal Health, and AutoZone. The US department of defence is a customer. Whatfix has over 900 employees, across Bengaluru, Gurugram, US, Europe (mainly the UK and Germany), Singapore and Australia. About 65-67% of the business comes from the US, and 20% from the UK and Germany.“Whatfix helps large enterprises realise RoI (return on investment) on their software investments,” Batti says. Large organisations use over a thousand software applications, but they can’t realise the true RoI unless employees use them effectively. “Our core product sits as a layer on top of these applications – like a GPS for software. It provides users with real-time guidance and nudges them to complete tasks accurately, ensuring compliance and productivity in a seamless way. We later launched an analytics product line that helps companies understand user behaviour and usage patterns. More recently, we introduced a simulation tool that allows employees to practice tasks before going live.”Whatfix’s last funding round of $125-million from Warburg Pincus and SoftBank in 2024 valued the company at around $900 million. It has an annual recurring revenue (ARR) of close to $85 million. “By 2026, we should cross $100 million ARR,” Bhatti says.The focus now is twofold: potential inorganic growth – Bhatti says they are evaluating acquisitions that could add another $10–20 million in revenue over the next 18 months – and deeper AI investments.The company has built three AI-powered components on its proprietary ScreenSense technology – an AI-led system that understands both the context of an application and the user’s intent, in order to recommend the next best action.There’s the Authoring Agent that helps users quickly create in-app support content, like walkthroughs and tips, by using natural language prompts instead of complex coding. The agent automatically picks it up from user manuals or documents, reducing authoring time by around 30% and potentially up to 70% as it matures. There’s an Insight Agent, which enables business leaders to access and interpret analytics through natural language queries, instantly generating and explaining reports while highlighting anomalies or trends. And there’s the Guidance Agent, which assists end-users directly within their workflow – recommending relevant actions, fetching contextual information, and identifying insights like customer sentiment or competitive mentions. Together these agents, Bhatti says, significantly enhance user adoption, productivity, and decision-making across enterprise systems.",Whatfix powers transformation for over 85 of the 500 biggest companies in the world.

He hinted that certain streamers might befrom automated systems designed to reduce inflated viewer counts, which has long been a contentious issue.

While Twitch has previously stated that it uses automated and manual reviews to combat artificial engagement, users have long speculated that certain high-profile streamers are less likely to face penalties for suspicious viewer metrics.The clip, which has already gained significant traction online, shows Asmongold discussing his theory during a recent livestream, which drew mixed reactions across social media. Some users supported Asmongold’s perspective, calling his pointwhile others dismissed it as unfounded conspiracy talk.

What next





American investment giant BlackRock has accused Bankim Brahmbhatt, the Indian-origin CEO of US-based telecom companies Broadband Telecom and Bridgevoice, of multi-million-dollar fraud, The Wall Street Journal reported.Lenders, including HPS Investment Partners - the private credit arm of BlackRock - have accused Brahmbhatt’s firms of fabricating accounts receivable that were used as collateral for loans. The lenders now claim to be owed over $500 million. Brahmbhatt’s lawyer told WSJ that his client disputed the fraud allegations.Bankim Brahmbhatt is the founder, president and CEO of Bankai Group, a US-headquartered telecommunications and fintech company.In interviews with Entrepreneur Middle East and Industry Chronicle, Brahmbhatt described himself as a telecom engineer turned entrepreneur, who began his journey in 1989 by setting up a push-button telephone manufacturing unit in India. Over the years, his ventures expanded into satellite dishes, telecom billing, and digital financial solutions.Bankai Group’s flagship product, MobiFin Elite, provides digital financial services and has been implemented by clients across several countries, particularly in Africa.Brahmbhatt often spoke about his vision to create a self-sustaining ecosystem for carriers, operators, and financial institutions, combining “technical skills and people skills.”His LinkedIn profile which earlier has sizable followers appears to have deactivated.According to WSJ, HPS began lending to a financing arm linked to Brahmbhatt’s companies in September 2020, later expanding its exposure to about $430 million by August 2024, with BNP Paribas helping finance the loans.Trouble surfaced in July 2024, when an HPS employee discovered that some customer emails appeared to come from fake domains imitating real telecom firms. When questioned, Brahmbhatt reportedly assured HPS officials there was nothing to worry about, before stopping all communication.Subsequent checks by accounting firm CBIZ and law firm Quinn Emanuel, hired by the lenders, found that emails and invoices provided as proof of receivables were falsified, the report said. A Belgian telecom company, BICS, confirmed to investigators that it had no connection to the emails used by Brahmbhatt’s firms, calling it a “confirmed fraud attempt.”Court filings allege that fraudulent customer contracts dated back to 2018 and that assets pledged as collateral were transferred to offshore accounts in India and Mauritius.Brahmbhatt’s companies - Broadband Telecom, Bridgevoice, Carriox Capital II, and BB Capital SPV - filed for bankruptcy in August, the same month lenders sued. BNP Paribas also reported adding €190 million (around $220 million) in loan-loss provisions linked to a “specific credit situation,” though it did not name the borrower.HPS has told clients it believes Brahmbhatt is currently in India. A person who visited the New York offices of his companies in July found them closed and vacant, the WSJ report said.Brahmbhatt also filed for personal bankruptcy on August 12, the same day his companies sought Chapter 11 protection.Despite the scale of the alleged fraud, sources told WSJ that the incident represents only a small portion of HPS’s $179 billion in assets under management and is unlikely to materially affect BlackRock’s overall performance.While the US courts are now handling the bankruptcy proceedings and civil lawsuits, Brahmbhatt has denied these allegagtions and is missing. The full scope of the alleged fraud and its potential impact on BlackRock’s private credit arm and BNP Paribas remains under investigation.","Bankim brahmbhatt is the indian-origin ceo of us-based telecom companies broadband telecom and bridgevoice.

LONDON: For sale: The world's most valuable toilet, a lavatory literally worth its weight in gold. Sotheby's announced Friday it will auction off the solid gold cistern, a sculpture by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan entitled ""America. ""The auction house calls it an ""incisive commentary on the collision of artistic production and commodity value."" It's also a fully functional toilet, identical to one that gained global fame when it was stolen in an audacious heist from England's Blenheim Palace in 2019.The starting price at the Nov 18 auction in New York will be the price of the just over 101.2kg of gold used to make it - about $10 million.David Galperin, head of contemporary art at Sotheby's in New York, said Cattelan is ""the consummate art world provocateur."" He's also one of most successful, an artist whose work ""Comedian,"" a banana duct-taped to a wall, sold at a New York auction last year for $6.2 million. ""Him"" - Cattelan's unsettling sculpture of a kneeling Adolf Hitler - sold for $17.2 million at a Christie's auction in 2016.The artist has said ""America"" satirises excessive wealth.""Whatever you eat, a $200 lunch or a $2 hot dog, the results are the same, toilet-wise,"" he once said.Two versions of ""America"" were created in 2016. The one being sold has been owned by an unnamed collector since 2017. The other version went on display in a bathroom at the Guggenheim Museum in New York in 2016. More than 100,000 visitors queued up to - to put it delicately - interact with the work.The Guggenheim offered the work to US President Donald Trump during his first term in office after he had asked to borrow a Van Gogh painting.In 2019, it went on show at Blenheim Palace, the English country manor that was the birthplace of Winston Churchill. Within days, it was stolen by burglars who broke into the building, forcibly wrenched it from the plumbing, and fled. Two men were convicted earlier this year and jailed. The toilet has never been recovered. Investigators think it was likely broken up and melted down.Galperin is unwilling to speculate on how much ""America"" could sell for. He notes that Cattelan's duct-taped banana posed questions about ""how one assigns value to something that has, in essence, no value aside from its authorship and its conceptual idea.""'America' is in many ways the complete inverse of that. It is a perfect foil in that this work has a lot of intrinsic value in a way that most artworks do not,"" he said ""The question of the proportion of value between the raw materials and the artistic idea is very on the table here.""""America"" will go on display at Sotheby's new New York headquarters, the Breuer Building, from Nov 8 until the auction. It will be in a bathroom, and visitors will be able to see it up close and personal.At Guggenheim and Blenheim Palace, the toilet was connected to the plumbing system and visitors could book a 3-minute appointment to use it. This time, visitors won't be able to use it - they can look, but they can't flush.","Sotheby's will auction off the solid gold cistern, a sculpture by italian artist maurizio cattelan entitled ""america"" it's also a fully functional toilet, identical to one that gained global fame when it was stolen in an audacious heist from england's blenheim palace in 2019.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125008566,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-65280,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
UAE: Sharjah discovers fifth onshore Gas Field at Al Hadiba,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-sharjah-discovers-fifth-onshore-gas-field-at-al-hadiba/articleshow/125088258.cms,"Sharjah’s fifth onshore gas field, Al Hadiba, holds economically viable reserves confirmed by Hedebah-02 well/Image: X

A new discovery in Al Hadiba





From discovery to appraisal: Hedebah’s rapid progress





Leadership and strategic vision





Advancing Sharjah’s energy independence









Sharjah has taken a decisive step towards energy self-sufficiency with the discovery and appraisal of new gas reserves in the Al Hadiba field. The findings, confirmed through the Hedebah-02 well, mark the emirate’s fifth onshore gas and condensate field, reinforcing Sharjah National Oil Corporation’s (SNOC) growing record of exploration success and its commitment to sustainable energy development.The Sharjah Petroleum Council (SPC), a government entity, has announced that economically viable gas reserves have been identified in the Al Hadiba field, situated north of the Al Sajaa Industrial Area. The discovery follows a recent drilling campaign conducted by SNOC, which completed the Hedebah-02 well over several months.The well is set for testing in the coming days to verify the quantities and overall potential of the reserves. Al Hadiba joins four other onshore fields in Sharjah, Al-Saja’a, Kahif, Mahani, and Muayed. Notably, Muayed has been converted into a gas storage facility, highlighting Sharjah’s strategic approach to both production and storage infrastructure.The Hedebah Gas Field first came into focus in 2024 with the drilling of the Hedebah-01 well, which revealed gas and associated liquids within the Thamama geological formations.That initial discovery was swiftly developed, entering production within ten months and contributing directly to the emirate’s energy supply.Building on this momentum, the 2025 drilling campaign focused on expanding and appraising the field’s potential. The Hedebah-02 well, drilled to a total depth of 13,200 feet, confirmed additional gas-bearing zones. Plans are underway for the well to be connected to production in the coming months, alongside further drilling aimed at assessing the full extent of the field.Khamis Al Mazrouei, CEO of SNOC, emphasised the significance of the latest milestone: “The successful drilling and testing of our second well at the Hedebah Gas Field marks another important milestone in SNOC’s journey to strengthen Sharjah’s energy resilience and long-term security. This achievement reflects our unwavering commitment to operational excellence, innovation, and sustainable growth. By continuing to unlock the emirate’s natural gas potential, we are delivering on our vision to ensure reliable energy for Sharjah today, while building a stronger, more resilient foundation for the future. ”Masoud Al Hamadi, Executive Director of Upstream at SNOC, added: “The successful testing of Hedebah-02 is the result of outstanding teamwork, from geoscience and engineering studies through to planning and execution. It demonstrates SNOC’s ability to efficiently move discoveries toward production.”The Hedebah development underscores SNOC’s ongoing commitment to advancing Sharjah’s energy independence. Beyond exploration and production, the corporation continues to enhance its strategic gas storage and processing capabilities, ensuring that the emirate’s growing energy needs are met reliably and sustainably.With the Al Hadiba field now entering appraisal and Hedebah-02 nearing production, Sharjah is consolidating its position as a regionally significant hub for natural gas, combining resource development with operational excellence and long-term energy planning.","Sharjah’s fifth onshore gas field, al hadiba, holds economically viable reserves confirmed by hedebah-02 well.
