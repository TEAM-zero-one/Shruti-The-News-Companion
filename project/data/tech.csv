Gabriella Zuniga: The woman rumored to be behind the Shannon Sharpe lawsuit



Who is Gabriella Zuniga? A young model with a quiet online past until now

For weeks, the $50 million civil lawsuit against Shannon Sharpe featured a mystery woman simply referred to as “Jane Doe.” But now, internet detectives and a few hip-hop gossip outlets believe they’ve uncovered who she is. Enter Gabbi Zuniga , a 20-year-old OnlyFans model whose name is suddenly at the center of one of the most talked-about legal cases in sports media.Here’s everything we know so far about Zuniga, where this information is coming from, and why the internet believes she’s the woman behind the allegations.The name Gabbi Zuniga first started trending on Twitter and TikTok shortly after news of the Shannon Sharpe lawsuit broke. According to viral posts from hip-hop accounts like WorldStarHipHop , OnSite, and The Neighborhood Talk, Zuniga is being identified as the woman suing Sharpe for rape, emotional abuse, and secretly recording intimate moments.Here’s why the internet believes Gabbi Zuniga is the woman suing Shannon Sharpe: The lawsuit never names the accuser, identifying her only as “Jane Doe,” but social media detectives quickly connected the dots. Screenshots of flirty DMs allegedly linked to Gabbi’s accounts began circulating, and old OnlyFans clips, TikToks, and deleted Instagram posts reportedly showed her in spaces resembling Sharpe’s home or hotel rooms described in the suit.Though the court documents still list the accuser as “Jane Doe”, these online receipts have pushed Gabbi’s name into the spotlight. No one has confirmed this yet, but screenshots of Gabbi’s alleged texts and DMs with Sharpe are circulating online and multiple Reddit and X (formerly Twitter) threads claim she was spotted with Sharpe in LA..Before this legal case, Gabbi Zuniga wasn’t a household name. She reportedly ran a modest OnlyFans account, occasionally posted on TikTok, and goes by the name of @sheiskarli on Instagram. Users claim she previously worked in LA as a fitness model and met Sharpe at a West Hollywood gym in 2023 when she was 20.Now, her name is trending across social media, with hundreds of users analyzing her posts and reposting alleged clips of her and Sharpe together.In civil lawsuits like this especially involving sexual assault—plaintiffs often use the name “Jane Doe” to protect their identity. It’s legal and standard practice. But once the story hits the internet, things can spiral.Gabbi hasn’t publicly confirmed or denied her involvement in the case, and her social media pages are now locked or deleted. Still, the viral naming has led to real-life implications, with online trolls, fans, and media digging into her private life.Sharpe’s legal team, meanwhile, is still treating the case as involving “Jane Doe,” and neither side has commented directly on Gabbi Zuniga by name.Whether or not the internet got it 100% right, the name Gabbi Zuniga is now tied to one of the most explosive sports lawsuits of 2025. From anonymous accuser to viral figure, her identity reveal (or alleged reveal) has added even more layers of drama and speculation to an already chaotic story.Also read - Inside the Shannon Sharpe lawsuit: A full timeline of the sexual assault case, lawyers, leaked videos, and what comes next","The name gabbi zuniga first started trending on twitter and tiktok shortly after news of the shannon sharpe lawsuit broke.

Google Gmail Update: Billions of Gmail users at Risk: Developer shares email that he says 'exploits vulnerability in Google’s infrastructure'; Google responds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-tips/billions-of-gmail-users-at-risk-developer-shares-email-that-he-says-exploits-vulnerability-in-googles-infrastructure-google-responds/articleshow/120562668.cms,"Google on hackers 'misusing' its infrastructure

Cybersecurity experts' safety tips for Gmail users

In a highly sophisticated phishing campaign, hackers are said to have successfully exploited Google’s infrastructure to send deceptive emails that appear to come from a legitimate Google address to trick users into handing over their login credentials. The attack, brought to light recently by Nick Johnson, lead developer of the Ethereum Name Service (ENS), involved emails sent from no-reply@google.com that passed DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) authentication -- fooling Gmail into treating them as authentic security alerts.“These emails are valid, signed, and display no warnings in Gmail,” Johnson said on X (formerly Twitter). “They appear in the same thread as real Google security alerts, making them even more convincing.”The emails claim to notify recipients of a subpoena involving unspecified content from their Google Account and prompt users to click a sites.google.com link to “examine the case materials” or “submit a protest.” The link leads to a counterfeit Google Support page hosted on Google Sites, where users are asked to either “upload additional documents” or “view [the] case.” These buttons redirect to a near-perfect replica of the Google Account sign-in page—designed to harvest user credentials.“The only hint it’s a phishing attack is that it’s hosted on 'sites.google.com' instead of 'accounts.google.com',"" Johnson noted.Johnson warned that the realistic design and subtle domain differences make the phishing attempt especially dangerous. “These scams are designed to look as real as possible,” he said. “Users who don’t spot the slightly altered domain could risk identity theft or financial loss.”Google confirmed the attack and stated it has since closed the loophole that allowed the abuse. “We’re aware of this class of targeted attack from this threat actor and have rolled out protections to shut down this avenue for abuse,” a Google spokesperson told The Hacker News. “We encourage users to adopt two-factor authentication and passkeys for stronger protection.”The company reiterated that it never asks for account credentials -- including passwords, one-time codes (OTPs), or confirmation prompts -- via email or phone. Google also advised users to verify the authenticity of any email by opening links manually in a separate browser window. According to Google’s privacy policy, legitimate government requests for account information are accompanied by advance notice—unless legally prohibited.Cybersecurity experts caution Gmail users, particularly those not using two-factor authentication or passkeys, are at heightened risk. While passwords alone can be compromised, passkeys—hardware-bound login credentials—offer significantly stronger resistance to phishing.To avoid falling victim, users should be skeptical of emails that use vague greetings, urgent calls to action, or links requesting personal data.",Hackers are said to have successfully exploited google’s infrastructure to send deceptive emails that appear to come from a legitimate google address.

Most apps today have become unusable. They bombard users with irritating notifications, spam messages, and dark patterns, and many are downright scammy.

Without your knowledge, numerous apps on your phone track and harvest extensive data: which apps you've installed, how you use them, the content of your emails and SMS, media on your device, and more.

What's truly disturbing is that some apps track usage not just within their own environment but across other apps too. This means your most personal data is being harvested without your consent and sold to companies for shady targeting purposes.

Enhanced efficiency



OpenAI has introduced a lightweight version of its ChatGPT deep research tool , designed to provide users with cost-efficient and faster responses while maintaining the depth and quality of research. This new version is powered by OpenAI’s o4-mini model, which is optimised for reasoning and data synthesis.“The lightweight version of deep research is powered by a version of OpenAI o4-mini and is nearly as intelligent as the deep research people already know and love, while being significantly cheaper to serve. Responses will typically be shorter while maintaining the depth and quality you’ve come to expect. Once limits for the original version of deep research are reached, queries automatically default to the lightweight version,” said the company.The lightweight deep research tool is now available to ChatGPT Plus, Team, and Pro users, with plans to extend access to Enterprise and educational users next week. OpenAI has also made the tool accessible to free-tier users, offering five tasks per month. Paying users benefit from expanded usage limits , with the tool seamlessly switching to the lightweight version once limits for the original deep research are reached.While responses from the lightweight version are shorter, they retain the structured logic and citations that users expect from the original deep research tool. OpenAI claims the lightweight model is cheaper to serve, enabling broader adoption without compromising the user experience.“All Plus, Team, and Pro users now have expanded usage of deep research. Enterprise and Edu users will get access the following week, and will have the same usage levels as Team users. The lightweight version of deep research is starting to rollout today to all Free users,” added the company.","Openai has introduced a lightweight version of its chatgpt deep research tool.

Citigroup has given a ‘buy’ rating on Divis Laboratories with the target price at Rs 7,050. Analysts feel the company has high potential to become the primary supplier given capacity addition. Orforglipron, Eli Lilly’s potential best-in-class oral GLP-1, is the next addition in Divi’s pipeline. They expect more rounds of capex with scale up in products. The stock is the top pharma pick.CLSA has a ‘hold’ call on Tata Consumer with a target price of Rs 1,044. Analysts said Jan-March net sales was up 17% on the year which was broadly in-line, along with the company’s gross profit. However, gross margin missed guidance due to high input costs while EBITDA was below estimates due to higher other expenses.ICICI Securities has retained its ‘hold’ rating on LTIMindtree with a revised target price of Rs 4,410. Analysts said LTIM reported muted performance for Jan-March with lower revenue growth. Slower growth came on the back of delayed ramp-up and deferral of deals, ramp-down in healthcare vertical, top-5 clients’ revenue declining from AI-led gain sharing. LTIM expects the deferred deals to come through in the current quarter.CEO designate’s three-pronged strategic emphasis on efficiency is expected to improve margin.HSBC has a ‘reduce’ call on Bajaj Housing Finance with the target price at Rs 100. Analysts said the housing finance company’s quarterly AUM growth was healthy but high cost ratio and yield compression due to competition were drags on its results. They expect EPS growth to slow due to pressure on AUM growth, NIM compression, and normalisation of credit costs.Nomura has given a ‘buy’ rating on Anant Raj Industries but with a lowered target price at Rs 700 due to reduced fund-raising visibility. Analysts feel the stock is still an attractive bet despite a more conservative stance on the data center segment. They said internal accruals would fund 50% of the company’s capex requirement.

Barron Trump's new photo has shocked those who have been following the closely guarded life of the President's youngest son as in the photos exclusively published by Daily Mail, Barron Trump looks different -- disheveled and somewhat plump in comparison to his usual sharp appearances. DailyMail described the look as 'pragmatic' as Barron was sporting a polo shirt and khakis when he was snapped on his way out of the New York University. He was looking more like his dad in his younger days, the report noted.The photos revealed that Barron Trump has changed his hairstyle and now wears it more naturally -- instead of his combed, polished look.Barron Trump is continuing his life in New York and not in Washington as he has his college to attend, though he does not have much of a social life in college. He is not allowed to give his phone number to anyone in the college and so he communicates with his friends via different gaming platforms, it was reported. Discord, Xbox are his outlets to reach out to his peeps, reports said. ""He has added it to his repertoire,"" a source told Page Six.""It's his communication platform of choice.""He can't give anyone his number to minimize the probability of his number getting leaked.

The billboard featured Bezos alongside pop star Katy Perry with a caption that read: ""If you can send Katy Perry to space, you can afford to pay more taxes.""The ad appeared days after Blue Origin — Bezos’ space venture — successfully launched its 11th human spaceflight from West Texas, featuring an all-female crew.

UAE offers free-of-charge portable desalination plants to cover arid Cyprus' summer water needs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/uae-offers-free-of-charge-portable-desalination-plants-to-cover-arid-cyprus-summer-water-needs/articleshow/120574884.cms,"Representative Image (AI-generated)

Poll Do you support the UAE's decision to provide desalination plants to Cyprus free of charge? No, Cyprus should manage its own resources. Yes, it's a great gesture of support.

NICOSIA: Cyprus will receive free-of-charge portable desalination plants from the United Arab Emirates to cover the tourism-reliant island nation's water needs this summer as reservoir deposits are nearly depleted, officials said Thursday.Agriculture and environment minister Maria Panayiotou told the state broadcaster that the UAE agreed to provide Cyprus, at no cost, an undetermined number of desalination plants that will produce a combined 15,000 cubic meters (530,000 cubic feet) of potable water daily.Panayiotou didn't disclose exactly when the units will arrive and become operational, but she said UAE authorities are aware the need is immediate as the summer tourism season kicks into high gear and water needs reach their peak.She said the deal is the result of secret negotiations over the last few months to cover Cyprus water needs that became acute when a fire knocked out one of its five static desalination plants, resulting in cuts to agricultural water supply. Each onshore unit produces 235,000 cubic meters (8.3 million cubic feet) of fresh water daily.The plant won't be back in operation until August and the portable units from the UAE will cover that lost water capacity, said Panayiotou. Technical staff are still trying to work out exactly where the portable units will be placed to maximize their utility, Panayiotou said. She didn't say when those units will be returned to the UAE.Apart from its own desalination plants, Cyprus continues to rely on an extensive reservoir network with a total capacity of 330 million cubic meters. Water levels across the 108 reservoirs - the most relative to population than any other European country - are less than a quarter of their capacity following the second-driest winter in a decade. Reservoirs were at 47.2 per cent capacity in 2024, official figures show.Cypriot President Nikos Christodoulides disclosed the UAE deal during an interview with local TV station ANT1, hailing the agreement as the result of Cyprus' expanded diplomatic outreach and the friendly relations it has developed particularly with the Emirates and other countries in the region.Panayiotou said irrespective of the UAE assistance, the government's medium- and long-term planning to permanently alleviate the island's water shortages is moving ahead.The planning includes the procurement of four additional mobile desalination plants expected to begin operating in late autumn, each capable of producing 30,000 cubic meters (1 million cubic feet) of drinkable water daily.Another two static desalination plants will be built over the long term, each with a 140,000 cubic meter (5 million cubic feet) daily output. Panayiotou unveiled last month a government plan to subsidize construction of private desalination plants at hotels. Tourism accounts for 13.5 per cent of Cyprus' gross domestic product. Tourist arrivals last year exceeded 4 million people, setting a new record.","Uae agreed to provide cyprus, at no cost, an undetermined number of desalination plants.

Delegated payments with full control: All you need to know about UPI Circle,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/delegated-payments-with-full-control-all-you-need-to-know-about-upi-circle/articleshow/120579468.cms,"Representative image

What is UPI Circle?

How it works

Approve each transaction individually using their UPI PIN, or



Set predefined limits so that secondary users can make payments up to that amount without requiring further approvals.

Real-world use cases

India’s digital payments landscape has taken a significant leap with the launch of UPI Circle , a feature by the National Payments Corporation of India ( NPCI ) that enables delegated payments while ensuring security and oversight.Designed to increase financial inclusivity and offer convenience in managing household and business payments, UPI Circle is now available on the BHIM app , with plans to expand to other platforms soon.UPI Circle allows a Primary User to authorise a Secondary User to carry out UPI transactions on their behalf within set spending limits. The primary user owns the bank account, while the secondary user may or may not have one.This means individuals who are currently excluded from UPI usage—such as elderly family members, children, domestic help, or staff—can now make digital payments easily and securely, backed by someone they trust.Primary users have two modes of control. They can either:This flexibility allows families and small businesses to delegate financial tasks efficiently, while still maintaining full oversight.Despite UPI’s growth, many Indians still depend on cash for daily needs due to lack of digital literacy or access to personal bank accounts. UPI Circle addresses this gap by enabling users who don't handle their own finances to participate in digital payments safely.According to NPCI, about 6% of UPI users make frequent transactions on behalf of others. With UPI Circle, these delegated payments become more structured, reducing reliance on cash and increasing transparency.Parental oversight: A parent can authorise their child to spend on stationery or food while monitoring spending limits.Senior citizen support: Elderly users who are hesitant about digital payments can allow children to complete the transaction remotely.Busy households: Working couples can enable domestic help to purchase essentials on their behalf with spending limits.Business owners: Entrepreneurs like car rental service providers can allow staff to make payments for fuel and other needs, ensuring accountability and reducing the use of petty cash.On BHIM, UPI Circle is integrated with built-in security and ease-of-use. The app lets you choose how much control you want—transaction-by-transaction approval or pre-set spending limits—making it ideal for managing family budgets or joint responsibilities.As per Bhimupi.org, UPI Circle is not just a convenience feature—it is a step towards financial inclusion . It brings non-users into the digital payments ecosystem while allowing experienced users to share financial access securely.As per NPCI, UPI Circle fosters “a more inclusive and connected financial ecosystem,” making digital transactions accessible to more people, without compromising on control or safety.","Upi circle allows a primary user to authorise a secondary user to carry out upi transactions on their behalf within set spending limits.

HP looks to double down on PC production in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/hp-looks-to-double-down-on-pc-production-in-india/articleshow/120602214.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: As India moves towards finalising a bilateral trade agreement with the US, American computer giant HP on Thursday said it will grow its manufacturing engagement in the country and will push for making more desktops and laptops.HP doubled its manufacturing output in the country last year, led by the Rs 17,000-crore production-linked incentive (PLI) scheme for making IT hardware and plans to grow the footprint of local production even further, India MD Ipsita Dasgupta said. “We are growing and are manufacturing through PLI with Dixon. So, we are growing our manufacturing in India. And every year over the next few years, you will see a proportional rise in the percentage of manufacturing here,” Dasgupta told TOI. The company leads the computer market in India and has now been going deeper into the country with new retail formats such as ‘HP Connect’— aimed at Tier 2and Tier 3 towns — that targets MSME clusters and household consumers.Dasgupta said production is being ramped up swiftly, especially as the ecosystem for manufacturing picks up. “Within our first year, we will double our manufacturing percentage in India. We’re making all-in-ones, desktops, and laptops.”Asked about the benefits of making in India, she said the PLI incentives are a significant enabler. “But more importantly, I think it’s exciting to be part of India’s desire to be a significant part of the global value chain . We have a large consumer base in India. So, as you make more in India, you also learn more about making in India. And that’s not something that we would want to be left out of.”She said the company believes that it will see more benefits of local manufacturing as the supplier ecosystem develops and becomes more cost-friendly. “You know, there’s still maths to be done on that, but it will get more cost-friendly. It’s getting there. And I actually think in the next two-three years, this will be something that the Indian ecosystem has surmounted.”","Hp doubled its manufacturing output in the country last year, led by the rs 17,000-crore production-linked incentive (pli) scheme.

"Government open to some duty-free US auto imports like 1,600cc bikes",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/government-open-to-some-duty-free-us-auto-imports-like-1600cc-bikes/articleshow/120600620.cms,"NEW DELHI: Government is open to offering duty-free access to certain automobiles imported from the US, such as bikes with over 1,600cc engine capacity, if it can secure a favourable deal in some areas of interest. Some of the concessions, which are still being discussed internally, may, however, come with quotas. This means the lower or zero duty benefit may be available only for a certain number of units imported under the proposed bilateral trade agreement.The US has mounted immense pressure on India to lower tariffs on automobiles, whiskey and farm products, arguing that high import duties are holding up American exports. While India slashed the customs duty on products, such as high-end bikes and bourbon in Feb, the Donald Trump administration is not satisfied and is pushing for further cuts. Harley Davidson bikes and Tesla cars are on top of Trump’s priority list, especially with Elon Musk being a key aide of the American President.Musk has been lobbying with India to lower import duties, something that the government refused to do earlier.However, last year, it came up with a new policy that offered 15% tariffs for a limited period, provided companies using the window set up a manufacturing facility. The detailed guidelines are expected only in a few weeks as inter-ministerial consultations are currently underway. A steep tariff reduction will, however, impact investment plans.Faced with the threat of reciprocal tariffs, the commerce department, which is leading negotiations for a bilateral trade agreement, is holding consultations with other government departments and ministries. These, in turn, are seeking feedback from industry and other stakeholders. While sectoral negotiations are yet to commence, a team led by India’s chief negotiator, Rajesh Agrawal, is currently in Washington to iron out pending issues and explore the possibility of an “early tranche. ”Originally, Trump and PM Narendra Modi agreed to have a first tranche by autumn (Sept-Oct), covering import duty on goods, non-tariff barriers, and ways to strengthen the supply chain. India is hoping that in return for concessions offered by it, the Trump administration will not impose the 26% reciprocal tariffs, which have been paused for 90 days, while also lowering duties for labour-intensive products, such as textiles and leather goods shipped from the country.","The us has mounted immense pressure on india to lower tariffs on automobiles, whiskey and farm products.

MUMBAI: Credit rating firm CARE has issued a monitoring agency report on Adani Transmission ’s Rs 8,873 crore raised via the QIP route in Aug 2024. According to the report, the company, now known as Adani Energy Solutions, deviated from the qualified institutional placement’s stated objectives. It diverted funds earmarked for smart meters to transmission systems — up to 10% of the money designated for installation of meters was redirected to transmission capex requirements.Though this deviation (up to 10%) is within the materiality threshold, it still requires formal disclosure and audit committee review, said a lawyer. Any deviation beyond 10% from the stated objects in the offer document may be considered material and might require shareholder approval, he added. The CARE report noted that Adani Energy spent about Rs 175 crore more than the planned expenditure in its transmission segment.“This amount (of Rs 175 crore) was utilised from the funds allocated towards the purchase and installation of smart meters,” read the report, disclosed by the company to the stock exchanges.In their comments, the company’s board of directors, chaired by Gautam Adani, said the over utilisation was necessary due to the growth in the transmission project capex outlay, which increased to Rs 60,000 crore by the end of fiscal 2025.In the QIP offer document, the company had outlined Rs 2,060 crore for expansion in transmission systems, Rs 1,800 crore for installing smart meters, Rs 2,420 crore for repaying borrowings, Rs 2,031 crore for general corporate purposes, and Rs 63 crore for issue-related expenses. By March 31, 2025, it utilised Rs 2,235 crore on transmission projects, Rs 916 crore on smart meter installations, and the balance on other stated purposes.Sebi rules require companies to strictly monitor and clearly disclose how funds raised through public issues are spent.","Care has issued a monitoring agency report on adani transmission’s rs 8,873 crore raised via the qip route in aug 2024.
