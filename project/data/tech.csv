Muslim-led startups filling gaps in India’s economy



NEW DELHI: On most evenings in New York, or Delhi-NCR, Ruha Shadab sits across a laptop screen, explaining professional etiquette to a roomful of Muslim women. Some wear hijabs. Some don’t. What unites them is not appearance. They are learning how to enter professional spaces that were never designed with them in mind. The session is about LinkedIn summaries, interview posture and how to talk about ambition. Many are the first in their families preparing for formal work.Far away in Jharkhand’s Garhwa, Nadim Iqbal Khan scans stock-market data on his phone. He’s checking which listed companies pass a religious test: No alcohol. No gambling. Limited debt. No interest-heavy income (Riba). Mohd Sufyan’s AzanGuru in Delhi beams Quran tutors into iPads — a technology-led learning app for modern learners.And in Mumbai, Nidah Merchant devises “modest” outfits, empowering women to enter public pools or gyms without constant self-surveillance, even as Mohammad Saif Nadeem in Pune manages Qurbani bookings over WhatsApp.None describe what they are building as “political” or as “resistance”.They’re solving ordinary problems — how to work, invest, dress, marry and practise faith in an urban, app-mediated life.Muslim aspiration in India is usually framed through “lack” — less education, fewer jobs, lower incomes. That’s slowly changing. According to Periodic Labour Force Survey, India’s female labour force participation stood at about 31.7% in 2023–24. For Muslim women, it was around 21%, up from about 15% in 2021–22, according to ministry of minority affairs. These numbers shape decisions.When Ruha Shadab returned to India after studying abroad, she often found herself the only Muslim woman in professional rooms. Being Muslim in Saudi Arabia was not a distinguishing feature. Here, it shaped first impressions. The contrast stayed with her. “I realised quickly that I was being read before I was being heard,” she told TOI. She said she sometimes detected a hiring bias.In 2019, while studying at Harvard University, Shadab founded Led By, to help Muslim women transition from education to employment. The programme focuses on women aged 18–30, college students or graduates from lower middle-income households. About 1,200 women have completed Led By’s programmes and over 50,000 have been supported. Many are first-generation professionals. Economic participation also depends on money. For decades, many Indian Muslims kept their distance from stock markets. Interest-based income raised religious doubts. Trading felt uncomfortably close to speculation. Nadim Iqbal Khan, 29, said, “People don’t call me asking how to get rich. They call asking if something is halal.” The questions are about permissibility, not profits.Since Covid-19, volume of queries has multiplied. He explains investing as “shared ownership” in a business, where both profit and loss are borne, making the income permissible within Islamic frameworks. And follows Sharia-compliant screening frameworks used globally. Roughly half of India’s listed companies qualify, he says. Indices such as the Nifty Shariah and BSE Shariah already track them. “Muslims have stayed behind financially because of lack of guidance. That gap can be fixed.”If money has moved into markets, marriage has moved into apps. As families became more nuclear, traditional “rishta networks” thinned. In 2019, Delhi-based entrepreneur Hammad Rahman launched NikahForever, a Muslim matrimony platform designed for marriage, not dating. Users wanted cultural familiarity, privacy and clear intent. Families wanted safeguards. NikahForever built its platform around these expectations. Today, it has over 2 million registered users in India and away.Clothing carries similar negotiations. For Mumbai’s Nidah Merchant, modest fashion was never a statement. It was logistical. Gym wear. Swim wear. Travel clothes. Constant adjustment. When modest fashion gained visibility on social media, Merchant realised this struggle was widely shared. The need, she says, was functional, not ideological. She launched Némah, a modest activewear and swimwear brand for women in 2020 to design clothes suited to Indian conditions.Education completes the picture. During the pandemic, Quran learning moved online but remained fragmented. AzanGuru, founded by Muhammad Sufyan Saif and Mohammed Imran in 2022, sought to digitise Quran learning. The platform has crossed 5 lakh downloads.Taken together, these ventures form an economy shaped less by ideology than by need, filling gaps where the mainstream falls short.","Muslim aspiration in india is usually framed through “lack’ — less education, fewer jobs, lower incomes.

How work-from-home reshaped office reality since Covid — And where it stands now,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/how-work-from-home-reshaped-office-reality-since-covid-and-where-it-stands-now/articleshow/127468115.cms,"Representative AI image

The productivity surprise

Opportunity without borders

The rise of outcome culture

Flexibility — With a cost

Visibility creeps back

The boundary problem

The hybrid mode

Work from home, a concept that barely featured in corporate vocabulary before 2020, quickly became the backbone of the global economy when the Covid pandemic brought daily life to a standstill. Offices shut overnight, cities fell silent, but work could not stop. Across industries, companies improvised at speed, building digital systems and remote processes that allowed business to continue without physical workplace gatherings.What began as a crisis response stretched far longer than many expected. For nearly four to five years, remote, then hybrid work defined professional life for millions. Companies discovered they could save on office space, electricity and travel-related expenses. Employees found they could reclaim commuting hours and redesign their workdays. But as organisations now push for a return to offices, some partially and others more aggressively, the big question is resurfacing: if work from home kept businesses running through the worst disruption in decades, why is it now being rolled back?The answer lies in a complex mix of productivity gains, cultural shifts and unintended consequences, as told by multiple corporate workers to TOI.For many employees, the early phase of remote work delivered an unexpected boost.“Without daily commuting and office distractions, I could start work with more energy and focus deeply on tasks,” said Abhishek Gupta, who works at a multinational company. Like many others, he found that removing travel time and office interruptions helped him complete tasks “faster and with better quality than in a traditional office setup”.Across sectors, from technology and finance to consulting and public relations, professionals describe the pandemic years as a period of intense but often highly productive work. Flexible schedules enabled many to craft their schedules based upon meaningful output instead of physical presence.Rachit Jasrotia, a senior project manager with a tech firm, believes the change made the teams more disciplined in the way they worked. Clear documentation, structured digital workflows and asynchronous collaboration became the standard. “Many of the practices introduced during that period — flexible schedules, async collaboration, and an emphasis on clear documentation — have continued and are now part of how we operate by default,” he said.Remote work did more than change how people worked, it changed who got access to work.Kriti, who joined the workforce in the field of finance after the pandemic, says she witnessed how Covid-era remote practices opened up more global collaboration. “Earlier we had limited work since they preferred work to be done by those who were in the US office,” she says. “But due to Covid, a lot of work started being done remotely, which gave Indian teams more opportunities to participate.”Her experience reflects a broader shift many multinational firms saw during the pandemic: location became less of a constraint. Work that was once tied to specific offices began flowing more freely, expanding exposure and responsibility for teams outside traditional headquarters.One of the most significant long-term shifts has been in how productivity is measured. Before the pandemic, time spent in the office often carried implicit weight. Remote work weakened that equation.“Productivity today is judged far more by outcomes — timely delivery, quality of insights, governance rigor, and the impact created,” said Gitanjali, a mid-level employee at a tech-firm. “This is a notable shift from earlier years where visibility or presence carried more weight. My work is data driven hence measured by accuracy, timeliness, and the strategic value delivered, not where I’m sitting. Covid played a key role in normalising this outcome‑focused approach,” she said reflecting on her time as a corporate employee before, during and after the pandemic.Other professionals across industries also said that performance conversations are now more closely tied to impact, quality and timeliness than just hours logged. The pandemic proved that high-quality work could happen without physical proximity, and many organisations adapted their evaluation frameworks accordingly.Even those who entered the workforce after the crisis found these norms already embedded. Meghna, who works in public relations, says flexible work structures and virtual collaboration were presented as standard practice when she began her career. “There is a clear focus on deliverables rather than rigid working hours,” she says. “There’s an understanding that people can be productive without being physically present at all times. ”If remote work brought freedom, it also brought fatigue and mixed feelings on always “being available”Gitanjali talked about how she felt the pressure sometimes to “always be reachable” but found ways to manage. “While I don’t feel explicit pressure to be “always online,” the nature of managing a large and diverse portfolio sometimes creates an implicit expectation to stay reachable across time zones. Stakeholders often operate with tight timelines, so responsiveness is important. I manage this by setting clear expectations, planning communication windows, and keeping governance structures strong so that not everything needs immediate escalation. ”Rachit Jasrotia added that while flexibility improved autonomy and focus, sustainability became a conscious effort. “ Hybrid work gives tremendous flexibility, but without intentional boundaries, work can easily spill into personal time. It requires conscious effort to disconnect, especially when tools and communication channels are always within reach.”Still, few professionals advocate a complete return to pre-pandemic routines. Instead, most are looking for balance - structured flexibility rather than either total remote work or rigid office mandates. Like Kriti who believes work from home has its challenges at times but overall it has made work more “sustainable” following pandemic-era policies at least partly.While many employees say performance is now judged more by outcomes, a quieter shift is underway as offices reopen and hybrid schedules take hold: the importance of being seen is returning, in some workplaces.Flipkart, a major e-commerce firm, announced the end of its work from home policy early last year.Amazon also mandated 5-days of work from the office. Wipro followed suit and tightened work from home rules, has mandated at least six hours in office for three days a week. Similarly, many other firms have tightened or shut-down altogether their work from home policy.Durgesh Kumar Jha, a public relations consultant, spoke on this, “In my experience, productivity at the workplace is increasingly judged by visibility rather than outcomes,” says “Work which is not seen, discussed, or repeatedly reinforced often goes unnoticed.”Meanwhile, in hybrid environments, digital presence has become the new form of visibility. Being active on internal chat platforms, speaking frequently in meetings and responding quickly to messages can shape perceptions of engagement — sometimes as strongly as tangible output.This, employees say, has revived a softer form of presenteeism. It is no longer about sitting late at a desk in the office, but about being continuously visible online.“There is pressure to respond quickly while working from home. I have experienced longer online hours and frequent messages,” said Abhishek, being at mid-management level. However, he remained in favour of the hybrid mode at his workplace adding, “However, once expectations are clarified, this becomes manageable.”That pressure to be seen often translates into pressure to be available.“There is a constant pressure to be available, irrespective of where you work from,” said Durgesh, adding “Availability is often confused with commitment.”Others describe it as less explicit but still persistent. Meghna noted that in client-facing roles, responsiveness is part of the job. “News cycles, client requirements, or urgent developments can sometimes demand quick responses beyond regular hours,” she said. “It’s more role-driven than policy-driven pressure.”Hybrid work has blurred time zones and boundaries, making delayed responses more noticeable. Some professionals say this has made work feel more continuous, even when organisations formally promote flexibility.One theme cuts across roles and industries: blurred boundaries.“Yes, the lines can blur, especially when working from home,” Meghna said. “It’s important to disconnect and protect personal time to avoid burnout,” she added, while referring to conscious efforts to separate the ‘two’ lives.Several professionals say they now rely on deliberate routines which includes- defined work hours, no-meeting windows and stricter notification controls - to prevent work from spilling into personal life.As more companies call employees back to the office, the work-from-home boom may be receding, but it is not disappearing. Instead, a hybrid compromise is emerging. Offices are increasingly seen as spaces for collaboration and relationship-building, while focused individual work often continues remotely.The future of work, professionals argue, will depend less on location and more on clarity.“Work-from culture has created an opportunity to build more inclusive, flexible, and high-impact teams. The key is balancing autonomy with clarity—clear priorities, shared expectations, and trust-based collaboration,” said Rachit.While Abhishek says, “Based on real experience, WFH works. It saves time, reduces stress, and improves focus. With trust, accountability, and clear boundaries, WFH is not just convenient—it is a better way of working for modern corporates.”The culture per-se that began as a necessity has now become a negotiation. Companies are rethinking space and culture. Employees are rethinking boundaries and balance. The next phase of work will probably not be as simple as choosing between home and office, but about defining how both can coexist without sacrificing productivity or well-being.","Covid pandemic brought daily life to a standstill, but work could not stop.

Why this cohort is growing

Back to build

In the Indian startup ecosystem, one constantly hears about how IITs and BITS produce some incredible founders. But there is a large cohort of founders that doesn’t get as much airtime despite quietly outperforming any single IIT when it comes to unicorn creation. Meet the BARBIE founders — those who did their Bachelors Abroad and Returned to Build in the Indian Ecosystem. The term, coined by Sajith Pai, a Partner at Blume Ventures, has gained traction as a shorthand for this distinct founder archetype.From Lenskart co-founder Peyush Bansal to Zepto’s Aadit Palicha, these founders have moved back to India to build audacious, ambitious and enduring businesses in the country. The numbers speak for themselves — of the roughly 300 BARBIE founders we identified, 3.7% have gone on to build unicorns, a rate higher than IIT Delhi (2.7%) and IIT Bombay (2%). BARBIE founders have started 11.5% of all active unicorns in the country.In 2024, there were 70,000 Indian students studying for undergraduate degrees in the US and UK according to Open Doors and HESA, compared to 20,000 students a decade ago.While this is a tiny minority of the overall Indian undergrad population of 33m students, this number has been growing fast due to rising income levels in India and a myriad of problems with the Indian college experience. Importantly, many of these students are now returning to build in India. Though there is no reliable data on this reverse brain drain, anecdotal evidence suggests that return rates among Indian undergrads are on par with, or slightly higher than, earlier cohorts, likely influenced by recent geopolitical concerns.BARBIEs overwhelmingly build companies targeted at consumers rather than enterprises. Consumer brands account for 37% of all BARBIE-founded companies, followed by marketplaces, fintech, gaming, and other consumer internet businesses.There are two key reasons for this. First is taste and global exposure. These founders usually go to colleges in the US (78%) and UK (16%) that happen to be a melting pot of cultures. New consumer trends naturally emerge from these cultural hotspots and founders are then able to bring this novel flavour of products with a local twist back to India.The typical BARBIE founder spends three to four years doing an undergrad degree, followed by a couple of years working in tech, consulting, or banking before eventually moving back to India. A lot of these founders start up soon after moving back, but a fair number also spend some time working in the ecosystem or their family businesses before venturing out on their own.We tracked the undergraduate alma maters of BARBIE founders. Penn ranks first, followed by Stanford, Michigan, and USC. Penn’s lead is unsurprising given Wharton’s presence and its role as an early cradle of US D2C. In India, the Penn diaspora has gone on to build brands such as Knya, Taali Foods, and The Pant Project.Knya founder Abhijeet Kaji says, “What my time at Penn and Stanford really changed was my relationship with time and ambition. I saw founders and operators who were not in a hurry to 'win' a year, but very intentional about building something that would matter in ten or twenty years. That long-term orientation changes the kinds of decisions you make…and how much you are willing to invest before the outcomes are visible. ”There is also a greater focus and appreciation on design language in many of these brands. Founders often come from fashion, design, or creative backgrounds — enabling them to build brands that feel globally fluent but are distinctively India-first.Second is leverage. Many founders come from families that run businesses in the same or adjacent sectors. Trying to build a new consumer brand is hard in India because of low entry barriers and intense competition. These founders have an unfair advantage as they can leverage their family businesses on either the supply (e.g. a textile manufacturing family business enabling a D2C brand) or demand side (e.g. a family-owned retail chain or distributor becoming the first large buyer).Let’s also address the elephant in the room — privilege. An undergrad degree in the US or UK can cost up to Rs 2.5 crore for a four-year programme, so it is only affluent families who can afford to send their children abroad. That affluence (and the safety net of family businesses in many cases) often influences their decision to come back and take the risk of entrepreneurship. They’re also bolder in challenging the status quo and often end up creating new markets.Aadit Palicha and Kaivalya Vohra showed consumers that you can build an ecommerce marketplace from scratch and deliver products to millions of customers within 10 minutes. Anjali Sardana of Pronto is transforming home services by organising a fragmented workforce with professional standards. Pratham Mittal, founder of Masters’ Union and Tetr, is building a completely new kind of educational institution, focused on learning by doing instead of just sitting in classrooms.BARBIE founders also tend to excel at fundraising. As colleges abroad encourage a healthy dose of interdisciplinary liberal arts classes with all the critical reading and writing training that goes with it, they are able to articulate their startup vision with clarity. In the early days of a startup, when you have nothing but a story, the most creative storytellers are the ones that succeed.However, it isn’t all rosy. They have no access to the IIT / BITS networks that are omnipresent in the Indian startup ecosystem. And coming from predominantly English-speaking privileged backgrounds sometimes works against them as they might have real blind spots about how the long tail of India lives and consumes. This is why you might not see a Kuku FM or Meesho being founded by a BARBIE founder. Finally, some investors are biased against this cohort, viewing them as less hungry because they come from privilege — which can be a fair critique in some cases.While global immigration is facing significant headwinds, Indian students still aspire to study abroad. However, the political environment in these countries discourages them from staying on after they graduate. This dynamic suggests that the number and significance of BARBIE founders will only increase significantly in the coming years.","In 2024, there were 70,000 indian students studying for undergraduate degrees in the us and uk. Many of these students are now returning to build in india. Of the roughly 300 barbie founders we identified, 3.7% have gone on to build unicorns. An undergrad degree in the us or uk can cost up to rs 2.5 crore for a four-year programme.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127442186,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-838605,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Planning a bank visit? You might want to reschedule, as banks are set for a four-day holiday, beginning from January 23 till January 26. Keeping track of bank holidays is crucial for customers to plan their finances in advance and avoid last-minute inconvenience.It is important to note that banks in India follow a combination of national and state-specific holidays, which means branch closures may vary from one state to another. Here's a list of when and where will banks remain closed for rest of January:Banks will remain shut in Tripura, Odisha and West Bengal on account of the Birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Saraswati Puja (Shree Panchami), Vir Surendrasai Jayanti and Basanta Panchami.Banks will remain closed as it is the fourth Saturday of the month. According to RBI, banks remain closed on second and fourth Saturdays of the month.Banks will remain sut nationwide, as it is a Sunday.Banks across the country will remain closed, to mark Republic Day While bank branches will not be operational on these days, customers will still be able to access a range of digital banking services.Online banking platforms, ATMs, mobile banking applications and UPI services will continue to function, allowing users to carry out fund transfers, bill payments and other routine transactions.However, services that require a physical visit to a bank branch, including large cash deposits, cheque clearances and the issuance of demand drafts, will not be available during the holidays. Account holders are therefore advised to complete such tasks in advance and rely on digital options when branches are shut.","Banks will remain shut in tripura, odisha and west bengal on account of the birthday of netaji subhas chandra bose, saraswati puja (shree panchami) according to rbi, banks remain closed on second and fourth saturdays of the month.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127237109,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1545779,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Shannon Sharpe's rise from being a college football standout in a tiny town to one of the most powerful voices in American sports media is also a narrative of consistent financial success. He had made a lot of money by 2025, not just from his NFL career but also from a very successful second act in television, podcasts, and business.He is widely regarded as one of the greatest tight ends in NFL history, transitioning smoothly from the field to the studio. That move proved just as profitable as his playing days.According to Celebrity Net Worth, Shannon Sharpe’s net worth is estimated to be around $30 million in 2025. His wealth came from his time as a player. He was picked in the seventh round in 1990, yet he went on to win three Super Bowls with the Denver Broncos and Baltimore Ravens. Sharpe made over $22.3 million in compensation over 14 NFL seasons. A strong figure for his era, even if modest by today’s standards.His biggest single-season paycheck came in 2000, when he earned about $5 million with the Ravens. By the time he retired in 2003, Sharpe had already positioned himself for a career in broadcasting.That is where his net worth truly accelerated.After working with CBS Sports and later co-hosting Skip and Shannon: Undisputed on Fox Sports, Sharpe became one of the most recognizable analysts in American television. In 2023, he joined ESPN’s First Take, signing a lucrative multi-year deal. While exact numbers were not made public, top ESPN personalities are believed to earn well into eight figures annually.The biggest driver of Sharpe’s wealth in recent years has been his podcast empire. His show Club Shay Shay exploded in popularity, especially after viral interviews like the famous Katt Williams episode in early 2024, which crossed 80 million views on YouTube. Sharpe later revealed that he made more money from that single episode than he ever made in any one NFL season.By 2025, Sharpe’s media network Shay Shay Media included multiple podcasts and partnerships, generating millions each year through YouTube ads, sponsorships, and licensing deals. Industry estimates suggest he was earning anywhere between $10 million to $15 million per year from media alone by 2025.He also added income through endorsements with brands like Nike, Reebok, Pepsi and Coors Light. In 2021, he launched his own premium cognac brand, Le Portier, which became a steady business venture tied closely to his personal brand.On the real estate side, he owns multiple high-value properties in Georgia and Los Angeles, including a custom-built 11,000-square-foot mansion.His wealth is still growing at 57, and his biggest financial years may still be ahead of him.","Shannon sharpe's net worth is estimated to be around $30 million in 2025.

Meaning of the quote of the day Microsoft co-founder by Bill Gates



Staying humble in a world of constant wins



Why failure is actually the better instructor



Bill Gates and the danger of overconfidence in 2026



Final thoughts on the Gates philosophy







Success is a concept we are all taught to chase from the moment we can understand the word. We see it in the headlines, on our social feeds, and in the lives of the people we admire. But Bill Gates, a man who has lived at the absolute peak of global influence and wealth for decades, has a different take on it. He famously said, ""Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose."" It’s a bit of a reality check, isn't it? Coming from someone who co-founded Microsoft and spent years as the richest person on the planet, you’d expect him to be success’s biggest cheerleader. Instead, he’s warning us that the very thing we want can actually be the thing that trips us up. He’s talking about that dangerous mix of ego and comfort that creeps in when things are going well.When Gates says success is a lousy teacher, he’s cutting through the fluff of typical motivational speeches. The core meaning here is about the psychological trap of ""winning."" When you fail, you’re forced to look in the mirror. You have to take apart your process, find the cracks, and figure out exactly where you messed up. That’s where the real learning happens. But when you succeed? You usually just pat yourself on the back.You assume that because you won, every decision you made along the way was the right one. This creates a blind spot.The second part of the quote—the idea that success ""seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose""—is even more pointed. Smart people are often the most vulnerable to this. If you’ve spent your life being right, it’s easy to start believing that you are inherently better or smarter than the market or the competition. Success makes you feel invincible. It lulls you into a state of complacency where you stop looking for risks because you don't believe they apply to you anymore. For Gates, this wasn't just a theory; it was a lesson he lived through at Microsoft during the rise of the internet and later the mobile era, where past dominance sometimes made it harder to see the next big shift coming.It’s hard to stay grounded when everyone is telling you how great you are. In today’s culture, we celebrate the ""win"" so loudly that we forget to check if the win was actually repeatable or just a stroke of luck. Bill Gates’ current work in 2026 shows he’s still trying to apply this logic. Despite his massive net worth—which still sits comfortably over $100 billion—he’s moved far beyond the world of software. He’s currently knee-deep in high-risk, high-reward projects like the ""Horizon 1000"" initiative.Just this month, in January 2026, the Gates Foundation partnered with OpenAI, committing $50 million to bring AI-driven healthcare to 1,000 clinics across Africa, starting in Rwanda. This isn't the move of someone who thinks they've already ""won"" everything. It's the move of someone who knows that the challenges of global health and climate change are much harder than building an operating system. He’s putting his resources into areas where failure is a very real possibility, which keeps that ""lousy teacher"" of success at a distance.If success is a bad teacher, then failure is the strict professor you hated in college but realised later taught you everything you know. Failure doesn't let you off the hook. It demands an explanation. When a project falls apart or a business goes under, the pain of that loss acts as a powerful motivator to never let it happen again. You become more observant. You look at the data more closely.I remember a time when I put everything into a project that I was certain would be a ""slam dunk."" I didn't even have a backup plan because I was so convinced of my own brilliance. When it inevitably tanked, I was crushed. But looking back, that failure taught me more about risk management and humility than any of my previous successes ever did. It stripped away the ego and made me a better strategist. I think that's what Gates is getting at. You have to be willing to be wrong to eventually be right in a way that actually lasts.Even now, as we navigate 2026, the tech landscape is shifting faster than ever. With AI moving from a buzzword to a fundamental part of our infrastructure, the risk of overconfidence is huge. Companies that were the kings of the hill five years ago are finding themselves scrambling. Gates has always been a student of history, and he knows that the graveyard of business is filled with ""smart people"" who thought they couldn't lose.Look at his recent investments in nuclear energy through TerraPower. On January 21, 2026, it was reported that South Korean energy giants are taking major stakes in his Natrium nuclear plant project in Wyoming. This is a sector where success is incredibly difficult to achieve and the regulatory hurdles are massive. Gates isn't playing it safe. He’s deliberately stepping into arenas where he has to prove himself all over again. He's avoiding the ""seduction"" of his past achievements by constantly starting new, difficult chapters.At the end of the day, Bill Gates isn't saying we shouldn't strive for success. He’s just saying we shouldn't trust it. Success is a temporary state, not a permanent trait. If you want to keep growing, you have to treat your wins with a bit of suspicion. Ask yourself: ""Did I win because I’m a genius, or did I just get lucky?"" Most of the time, it's a bit of both. By staying curious and keeping a bit of that ""loser’s hunger,"" you can avoid the trap of thinking you’re untouchable. It’s a tough way to live—always looking for the hole in your own boat—but it’s the only way to keep from sinking.","Gates famously said, ""success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose"" he's talking about that dangerous mix of ego and comfort that creeps in when things are going well. Success makes you feel invincible. It lulls you into a state of complacency. When it inevitably tanked, i was crushed.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127271649,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-32814,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Jensen Huang explains why AI changes tasks, not the purpose of jobs

AI did not replace radiologists it made them more in demand

Legal and service industries adapt

Redesigning work, not removing it

A shift in how work is done





People are getting more and more worried about losing their jobs as AI becomes more common in the workplace. Many workers are worried that machines could completely take over human jobs, from offices to hospitals. Nvidia's CEO, Jensen Huang, thinks this fear misses an important point. Speaking on the No Priors podcast, Huang offered a calm and practical view of how AI is actually changing the workplace. He says that AI is not taking away the purpose of jobs. It's not changing the jobs themselves; it's changing how some parts of them are done. AI takes care of boring or time-consuming tasks so that people can focus on things that need human judgment, experience, and responsibility. Huang's argument is based on examples from the real world in healthcare, technology, law, and even the service industry.One of the main things Jensen Huang talked about was the difference between tasks and goals. People do tasks every day, like typing reports, looking over documents, or scanning pictures. Purpose is the reason the job exists in the first place.Huang explained that AI is very good at handling tasks, especially those that are repetitive or rule-based.However, it does not replace the core purpose of a role. In many cases, removing these smaller tasks allows professionals to do their jobs better and on a larger scale.Radiology is often cited as a field that AI would disrupt or shrink. Years ago, some experts predicted that automated image analysis would reduce the need for radiologists. Huang pointed out that the opposite has happened.Recent data shows that in 2025, diagnostic radiology residency programs offered 1,208 positions, a 4 percent increase compared to the previous year. Radiology has also become the second-highest-paid medical speciality, with average incomes reaching $520,000. This marks a 48 percent increase since 2015.AI now helps radiologists read scans faster and more accurately. But the core responsibility, diagnosing disease and guiding treatment, still depends on human expertise. Because hospitals can now process more cases, they earn more revenue and hire more specialists.Huang used his own role to explain the idea further. He said much of his day is spent typing, reviewing information, and communicating. AI tools that help automate writing or summarising tasks save him time.However, he made it clear that this has not reduced his workload. Instead, it allows him to handle more responsibilities. AI takes away the stress of smaller tasks, which helps him focus on making decisions, planning, and leading.AI is also having a big effect on software development. AI tools can now write code, find bugs, and speed up the development process. Some assume this means fewer engineers are needed.Huang rejected this view. At Nvidia, the company continues to hire engineers even as AI tools become more capable. Faster development means more projects can be taken on. That, in turn, creates demand for skilled people who can design systems, solve problems, and guide long-term technical direction.The legal profession is also changing. AI can quickly review documents and search through large volumes of data. Still, lawyers remain essential for protecting clients, resolving disputes, and applying judgment in complex situations.Huang also spoke about service jobs, such as restaurants. Even if AI takes over tasks like order-taking or delivery, the purpose of the job remains unchanged. The goal is still to make customers happy. People who work adapt by focusing more on personal interaction, problem-solving, and the quality of service.Huang's main point is that AI doesn't take jobs away; it changes the way people do them. The most affected are jobs that require you to do the same things over and over. Jobs that require results, care, creativity, and responsibility still need people.AI is a tool that helps workers get more done. It helps businesses serve more customers, patients, or users by making them more productive, which usually means they hire more people.AI is changing how work is done instead of taking jobs away. It clears up bottlenecks, makes everyday tasks go faster, and gives professionals more time to focus on what's really important. Huang says that in the future, work won't be about fighting AI. Instead, it will be about figuring out how to use it to get better results while keeping people at the center.","Jensen huang explains why ai changes tasks, not the purpose of jobs.

Merge Labs vs Neuralink





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has announced an investment in Merge Labs, a brain-computer interface (BCI) startup which was founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Rival to Elon Musk ’s Neuralink, the mission of Merge Labs is to develop safe and scaleable brain-computer interfaces. “We are excited to support and collaborate with Merge Labs as they turn an ambitious idea into reality and ultimately products that are useful for people,” said the company.OpenAI revealed that funding made by the company will support Merge Labs’ mission of creating safe, scalable brain-computer interfaces that could one day allow humans to interact with artificial intelligence directly through neural signals. The company has not yet disclosed the size of the investment, but the partnership underscores OpenAI’s growing interest in technologies that extend beyond software into hardware and human augmentation.Merge Labs is a research lab with the long-term mission of bridging biological and artificial intelligence to maximize human ability, agency, and experience. It is developing fundamentally new approaches⁠ (opens in a new window) to BCIs that are safe and interface with the brain at much higher bandwidth by combining biology, devices, and AI.The company is focused on creating non-invasive neural interfaces that can translate brain activity into digital commands. Unlike more invasive approaches that require surgical implants, Merge Labs aims to build consumer-ready devices that are both accessible and ethically designed.The company’s early prototypes reportedly use advanced sensors and machine learning models to interpret neural signals, with potential applications ranging from medical rehabilitation to enhanced productivity tools.Elon Musk founded Neuralink in 2016 and till now the company has made significant progress in developing brain implants which enable people with paralysis to control devices with the help of their thoughts. The Elon Musk-owned company recently raised $600 million at a $9 billion valuation and is conducting human trials.Merge Labs on the other hand, is reportedly working on less invasive brain interfaces with a strong emphasis on AI-powered enhancements. The focus of the startup is not just medical rehabilitation but broader human-AI integration.“I believe the merge has already started,” Altman wrote in a 2017 blog post. “We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants”.","Merge labs is a brain-computer interface (bci) startup founded by openai ceo sam altman.

Satya Nadella says competition is 'keeping us fit'

CEO Satya Nadella says Microsoft avoiding the 'Zero-Sum' trap





During a wide-ranging discussion at the World Economic Forum 2026, Nadella said that while the competition with fellow tech giants like Google, Meta and other is fiercer than ever, the expanding role of technology in the global economy makes this a “blessed” time for the industry. His comments came amid a “pretty intense” era led by artificial intelligence (AI) and shifting global markets.“It's a pretty intense time. I mean, so the way I always think is, it's always helpful. When you have a complete new set of competitors every decade, because that keeps you fit,” Nadella said. Reflecting on his 34-year journey at Microsoft, Nadella dismissed the idea that the AI race is a zero-sum game, instead pointing to a future where tech’s share of the world's GDP will only continue to rise.Nadella highlighted that Microsoft’s longevity is rooted in its ability to adapt to new “existential” rivals every decade. He recalled joining the company in 1992 when the primary threat was Novell, further noting that the competition has now changed with its AI rivals“If you think about it, I joined Microsoft in 92 when I had Novell as the big existential competitor. Here we are in 2026, it's a pretty intense time. I'm glad there's the competition.It's, quite honestly, at the end of the day, when I look at it right as a percentage of GDP five years from now, where will Tech be right? It will be higher, so we're blessed to be in this industry,” the Microsoft CEO added.While there is a narrative that there’s a winner-takes-all scenario, Nadella insisted that the Total Addressable Market (TAM) tells a different story.“It's a lot of intense competition, but it's not so zero-sum, as some people make it out. Oh, it's getting much bigger, much more. The TAM and it’s just the impact of the stack is going to be so,” Nadella noted.While taking about customer intent, Nadella argued that the key to survival is understanding the “brand permission” a company has with its users.“The question that I always go back to is what’s the brand identity that Microsoft has and the brand permission we have, what customers expect from us,” Nadella noted.","Microsoft ceo satya nadella spoke at the world economic forum 2026.

Artificial intelligence is no longer something people only argue about in tech conferences or future forecasts. It is already quietly shaping daily life in profound and often unexpected ways. From customer support chats to recommendation engines, from coding tools to medical research, AI is now part of how work gets done efficiently. And according to Bill Gates , the pace of change is about to speed up even more dramatically.In his latest annual letter, The Year Ahead, the Microsoft co-founder lays out a clear message. AI will reshape society, economies, and jobs faster than most people expect. Gates says he remains optimistic about technology, but this time his optimism comes with serious warnings. The benefits are real. So are the risks. And ignoring either would be a grave mistake.Gates has spent decades watching technology alter economies and daily life. In his letter, he says AI is different from past waves of innovation. Not just faster, but broader. He argues that artificial intelligence could affect more parts of society than any previous human-made tool.He points to progress already happening. AI is accelerating disease research, improving climate modelling, and expanding access to digital education.Tasks that once took years can now be completed in months, sometimes weeks. For Gates, this is proof that AI can solve hard problems if used well.But he also stresses that hope alone is not a strategy. Institutions, governments, and workers are not fully prepared for how quickly these changes are arriving. Without planning, the speed of AI adoption could leave many people behind.One of Gates’ biggest concerns is how AI could be misused. As advanced tools become more accessible, the barrier to harmful use drops. He has warned that open-source AI systems could be exploited by bad actors, including non-state groups.In particular, Gates has raised alarms about biological threats. He suggests that AI-assisted misuse could pose risks even greater than naturally occurring pandemics. That is not a casual statement. It reflects a growing fear among researchers that powerful tools, in the wrong hands, could scale harm faster than ever before.Gates argues that global cooperation is essential. Clear rules, oversight, and governance structures are needed. At the same time, he acknowledges the tension. Too many restrictions could slow beneficial innovation. Too little could invite danger. Finding the balance will not be easy.Jobs sit at the centre of Gates’ warning. He says AI makes it possible to produce more goods and services with less human labour. That reality will change how companies hire and how work is valued.Some of this is already visible. In software development, AI tools help programmers write, test, and maintain code faster. Gates notes that developers can now be significantly more productive, which lowers costs and reshapes team structures.He also points to sectors like warehouse operations and phone-based customer service. As AI systems improve, these roles are likely to face pressure. Automation will not arrive all at once, but it will arrive steadily.Gates does not frame this as doom. He frames it as a disruption that needs preparation.Beyond job losses, Bill Gates talks about how work itself might change. If AI boosts productivity enough, shorter workweeks could become possible. The same output, fewer hours. It sounds appealing. But he is careful not to present it as automatic.Whether these gains benefit most people depends on policy choices. Who owns the productivity gains. How companies share them. Without thoughtful decisions, Gates warns that efficiency could concentrate wealth instead of spreading it.This is where governments and institutions matter. AI alone will not deliver fairness. People have to decide what to do with the gains it creates.","Gates says he remains optimistic about technology, but this time his optimism comes with serious warnings. He argues that artificial intelligence could affect more parts of society than any previous human-made tool. Gates argues that global cooperation is essential. Clear rules, oversight, and governance structures are needed.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126589003,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-35844,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

‘Tobacco is responsible for America’s obesity and chronic illness’: RFK Jr. says cigarette giants engineered addictive foods,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/tobacco-is-responsible-for-americas-obesity-and-chronic-illness-rfk-jr-says-cigarette-giants-engineered-addictive-foods/articleshow/127514789.cms,"What RFK Jr. said about addictive foods

The tobacco-to-food link and corporate history

Why the “addiction science” framing is being debated





US Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. has blamed Big Tobacco for helping drive America’s obesity and chronic disease crisis by shaping the modern ultra-processed food industry. In a 77 WABC radio interview, Kennedy claimed cigarette companies, facing lawsuits and tightening regulation over smoking, diversified into food by buying major brands and applying the same research approach used to increase cigarette dependence. He argued that this “addiction science” was redirected towards engineered foods designed to keep people eating, contributing to rising levels of obesity, diabetes, and other long-term health problems.Kennedy said tobacco firms such as Philip Morris and R.J. Reynolds moved into the food sector as public pressure mounted against cigarettes. He claimed they purchased major packaged food companies and used scientific expertise to design products that encouraged repeat consumption.He also used blunt language to describe these foods as chemically engineered to taste good while offering little nutritional satisfaction, saying this pattern helped fuel overeating and worsening health outcomes.Kennedy is not claiming tobacco is literally being mixed into food. His argument centres on product engineering and the idea that companies can design foods to maximise cravings and repeat consumption.In practice, researchers and public health experts often point to features of many ultra-processed foods such as high levels of added sugars, salt, and fats, as well as textures and flavour profiles built to make eating effortless and highly rewarding.Kennedy’s comments draw attention to a real historical overlap between tobacco companies and major packaged food ownership in the late 20th century. During that period, tobacco firms acquired and controlled large food brands, expanding their influence far beyond cigarettes and into everyday diets.Supporters of the broader argument say this corporate crossover matters because tobacco companies were known for sophisticated marketing, consumer research, and product optimisation, all of which can shape what people crave and consume.The idea that ultra-processed foods may drive addiction-like eating patterns has gained attention in recent years, as researchers examine why some products trigger strong cravings, repeated snacking, and difficulty cutting back even when health risks are clear.This remains a contested scientific area, but it has become a powerful political argument because it shifts the discussion from personal discipline to how products are designed and marketed at scale.Kennedy framed the issue as a public health emergency that requires systemic action. His remarks align with the “Make America Healthy Again” messaging, which focuses on reducing chronic disease rates and shifting the national diet away from heavy reliance on ultra-processed foods.The comments also arrive alongside broader discussions in Washington about dietary guidance, food industry accountability, and whether stricter regulation is needed to reduce obesity and diet-linked illness.Kennedy’s claims are likely to intensify debate over the food industry’s role in public health. That includes questions about how ultra-processed foods are engineered, how they are marketed, and what standards should apply when products are tied to rising levels of obesity and chronic disease.For now, his central message is clear: he wants the obesity crisis treated as an issue of corporate influence and engineered consumption, not simply individual choice.",Kennedy said tobacco firms such as philip morris and r.j. reynolds moved into the food sector as public pressure mounted against cigarettes.

‘Spent $3.25 million hiring H-1B workers’: Texas university draws backlash over foreign hiring and claims of ‘importing labour’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/spent-3-25-million-hiring-h-1b-workers-texas-university-draws-backlash-over-foreign-hiring-and-claims-of-importing-labour/articleshow/127509480.cms,"Texas A&M sponsored 659 H-1B workers since 2020

Comparison with UT Dallas adds fuel to the debate

H-1B Visa Shake-Up Fuels Anti-Indian Campaigns as Donald Trump's Policy Reshapes US Hiring

Supporters say H-1B hiring supports research and innovation





Texas A&M University is facing backlash after fresh claims that the public university spent around $3.25 million on H-1B visa fees and related immigration costs between 2020 and late November 2025, sponsoring hundreds of foreign workers for a wide range of roles. The figures have sparked criticism online, with some questioning whether the institution is relying too heavily on overseas recruitment at a time when graduate job opportunities, particularly in tech, remain under pressure. Supporters, however, say H-1B hiring is often used by major universities to fill specialised roles, keep research moving, and prevent staffing disruptions across teaching and technical operations.According to The Dallas Express, which cited USCIS records, Texas A&M had 659 H-1B beneficiaries approved from 2020 through September 2025, the most recent period referenced in the data.The story also pointed to the wider Texas A&M System, claiming approvals across affiliated entities exceeded 1,400. The spending total was reported as $3,252,339.17, covering visa-related costs across different stages of the process, including processing and sponsorship fees.The controversy is not just about money, but also about the types of jobs linked to the filings. The records cited included instructional roles as well as non-teaching positions such as Graphic Designer II, Communications Manager, and software application developer.Some job postings referenced standard qualification requirements, including a bachelor’s degree and several years of experience. Supporters argue that in large university systems, many of these roles support ongoing programmes, labs, and campus operations, where stability and specific technical experience can matter as much as academic credentials.The spending has also been contrasted with hiring at the University of Texas at Dallas, which was cited as spending about $1.1 million to sponsor roughly 300 H-1B workers over a similar period.Critics have taken this as evidence that Texas A&M is relying more heavily on foreign hiring, while others note that differences in size, staffing needs, and institutional structure can significantly shape both the number of visas and the overall cost.The debate has intensified amid wider concerns about the job market for young tech workers. A 2025 estimate from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York cited in the coverage reported 6.1% unemployment and 16.5% underemployment among computer science graduates.Even so, higher education advocates argue that H-1B hiring does not always clash with graduate hiring, particularly when roles require specialised experience or when staffing supports research and teaching systems that benefit students.While the backlash has been loud, supporters of the programme argue it remains a key hiring pathway for universities, especially for roles that sustain research output, strengthen academic programmes, and maintain competitiveness for funding and talent.The American Association of University Professors has defended H-1B as an important route for attracting skilled professionals into the US workforce, particularly in areas where institutions struggle to fill roles quickly through domestic hiring alone.The Dallas Express report said the records were released after delays and referenced a pending complaint with the Texas Attorney General. For now, the story has become another flashpoint in the broader debate over immigration hiring, graduate employment pressures, and transparency at publicly funded institutions.","Texas a&m sponsored 659 h-1b workers since 2020.
