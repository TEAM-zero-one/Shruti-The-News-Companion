Indian-American businessman who co-founded Hotmail got a major clapback on social media when he made fun of India celebrating its emergence as the world's 4th largest economy. Bhatia said India should feel ashamed as 415 million people in India survive on $3.10 per day. Indian users did not think twice to give it back to Bhatia, asking him who he wanted to please with his social media post with backdated and wrong data.Bhatia engaged with some of the critics as well, offering free introspection on what India needs, according to him.But he was shown what real shame is as X users asked him to change his surname first before spewing hatred on India.""You’re just an idiot. Why are you bragging about being the world’s No. 1 economy with $36–37 trillion in debt?"" one asked to which he replied and said US never bragged about being the top economy in the world.People asked him what he does for living apart from posting on X and earning money from his social media post engagement. ""What happened to the Rafael you were supposed to gift the Nation. Do something productive in life. As it looks you are now dependent on Social Media for living,"" one commented.""Another personal attack. When losers like you don’t know how to counter my way of thinking, you resort to personal attacks. Weak minded and insecure,"" Bhatia replied.""For whom was this post? Political leadership of India? If yes then have balls to say so. If it’s for common citizens then it’s incorrect as they are not bragging. Suggest take interest in politics of your country which is facing huge challenges,"" one said.""Shameless ! You sold Hotmail for $400 million in Dec 1997. How many billions have you made since then? ZERO- All your venture failed miserably. And you are lecturing here on X to the fastest growing economy,"" one comment read.""Surname badal le phle (change your surname, first),"" one comment read mocking at how the Indian-origin entrepreneur does not even hide his Indian identity when he criticizes his country.But all this criticism did not deter Bhatia.

Digital economy has eliminated traditional boundaries

Companies report positive results from flexible schedules

Shark Tank judge and millionaire Kevin O'Leary has dismissed the growing four-day workweek movement as ""the stupidest idea I have ever heard,"" arguing that the modern digital economy has already made traditional work schedules obsolete.Speaking on Fox News, the 70-year-old investor took particular aim at France's exploration of shortened work weeks, suggesting a provocative alternative: ""I think we should let the French go to a two-day workweek and then kick their ass internationally,"" he spoke at a Fox TV show.O'Leary contends that pandemic-era changes have fundamentally altered how work functions. ""There's no such thing as a workweek anymore anyway on a digital economy, post-pandemic,"" he explained. With 40% of his staff working remotely worldwide, he focuses on project completion rather than hours clocked.""I don't care when my staff does their work—as long as it gets done on time,"" O'Leary said, acknowledging that while he opposes mandated four-day weeks, the traditional 9-to-5 model is equally outdated.Despite O'Leary's skepticism, numerous organizations are seeing benefits from shortened workweeks. Performance coaching company Exos implemented a four-day schedule for its 3,500 employees, resulting in 24% increased productivity and halved burnout rates.The trend has gained executive attention, with 30% of CEOs now considering organization-wide schedule shifts, according to KPMG survey data. International governments are also experimenting—Tokyo's metropolitan government recently introduced four-day options to address population decline and improve work-life balance .""We must build a society where everyone can balance work and family life, and one step forward is the four-day workweek,"" Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike told Fortune.Research supports worker interest, with 77% of employees saying a four-day workweek would favorably impact their wellbeing, even if maintaining 40 total hours, according to Gallup polling.","Kevin o'leary: ""there's no such thing as a workweek anymore anyway on a digital economy, post-pandemic"" 30% of ceos now considering organization-wide schedule shifts, according to kpmg survey.

GTA 6: Key gameplay leaks



GTA 6: Upgraded map



GTA 6: More speculated features



While Rockstar Games maintains a tight lid on information surrounding the highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6, a new wave of unofficial ""leaks"" has reportedly surfaced online, offering more details about the game's gameplay mechanics, expansive map, and various content elements. The leaks suggest that GTA 6 will feature over 700 enterable stores, functional malls, and a revamped character-switching system. Rockstar Games has confirmed that GTA 6 will launch on May 26, 2026, for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, though a PC release date remains unannounced.According to reports from various gaming news outlets and social media discussions, these recent leaks suggest several intriguing gameplay additions. Among them is the purported return of a 6-star wanted level, a fan-favourite feature from previous GTA instalments. The ""relationship bar,"" previously hinted at in leaked 2022 clips and said to function akin to the ""honour"" system in Red Dead Redemption 2, also reportedly still exists.New elements include weight mechanics and explorable underwater areas brimming with treasure and secrets. The leak also claims that the scene from Trailer 2 where Jason buys beer is actual gameplay, hinting at enhanced environmental interaction. The ""greet and antagonise"" system, seen in Red Dead Redemption 2, is also rumoured to be integrated.A significant detail suggests a revamped character wheel with three options: playing as Solo Jason, Solo Lucia, or a Dual protagonist control mode allowing simultaneous control of both characters for open-world robberies and specific missions.The leaks indicate that GTA 6’s map will not feature a Panhandle, contradicting previous speculation. However, the game will still include a vast open world, with Vice City at its core and additional locations inspired by Florida’s diverse landscapes.While a ""Disney World parody"" is reportedly not included, fans are dissecting every pixel of the existing trailers and unconfirmed data to piece together the full scope of Vice City and its surrounding areas, including Ambrosia and Port Gellhorn.Further alleged content details include the presence of male strippers, an assertion that the driving mechanics are the ""best it's ever been,"" and gore/dismemberment built upon Red Dead Redemption 2's system. However, some rumoured features from earlier leaks, such as fully nude sex scenes, listening to music outside of a car, prone movement, and dual-wielding weapons, are now claimed to have been cut. The story is reportedly structured into five chapters, similar to Red Dead Redemption 2.","A new wave of unofficial ""leaks"" has reportedly surfaced online.

Today’s Connections Answers

Explanation of the answers

NYT Connections is back with another thrilling word puzzle. The game continues to grow in popularity. Each day brings a new challenge for players to find hidden links among 16 seemingly unrelated words. Whether you are a seasoned player or a beginner, solving the puzzle can be both fun and tricky. This guide offers a quick overview of today's hints and answers to help you progress without spoiling the experience too soon. If you're stuck or just curious about today's puzzle solution, keep reading to find all the details you need to crack the grid for June 11, 2025.Connections is a daily puzzle game from The New York Times. It presents players with a 4x4 grid of 16 words. The challenge is to group these words into four sets of four based on a shared theme or category. These connections might be obvious or require some creative thinking. Categories can range from types of animals to famous characters or grammatical symbols. Only one correct solution exists for each puzzle and players must avoid making too many wrong guesses. It’s a game that rewards observation and lateral thinking.To play NYT Connections, look at the grid of 16 words and try to form four groups of four words that are related in some way. When you think you’ve found the correct group, select those four words and submit your answer. If it’s correct, the group will disappear. If it’s not, you lose one of your four chances. Some words may appear to belong in more than one group, so it’s important to think carefully. The difficulty level increases across colour categories. Yellow is the easiest group, green and blue are intermediate, and purple is often the most challenging. The game resets every day at midnight with a new puzzle.And here are some helpful hints for each group:Yellow group — boast: BLUSTER, CROW, SHOW OFF, STRUTGreen group — arc-shaped things: BANANA, EYEBROW, FLIGHT PATH, RAINBOWBlue group — cereal mascots: COUNT, ELVES, LEPRECHAUN, ROOSTERPurple group — ways to denote a citation: ASTERISK, DAGGER, NUMBER, PARENSThe yellow category was all about expressions of pride or arrogance. Words like BLUSTER, CROW, SHOW OFF, and STRUT captured different ways people boast or act superior.In the green group, the theme was curved shapes. Items such as BANANA, EYEBROW, FLIGHT PATH, and RAINBOW were included for their characteristic arc-like form.The blue set brought together cereal mascots. COUNT represents Count Chocula, ELVES are the faces of Rice Krispies, LEPRECHAUN stands for Lucky Charms, and ROOSTER refers to the Kellogg’s Corn Flakes mascot.The purple group highlighted text citation symbols. ASTERISK, DAGGER, NUMBER, and PARENS are all commonly used to point readers to footnotes or additional context in writing.Today’s Connections puzzle offered a nice balance of clear and clever groupings. While the mascots might have challenged some players, the citation theme added a thoughtful twist. Whether you breezed through or leaned on a hint, it was another entertaining brain workout.

As everyone’s geared up for Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) 2025, excitement is building among tech geeks, developers, and iPhone users. Packed with promises to be one of the biggest WWDC conferences so far, Apple is expected to introduce the most awaited iOS 26 , the future mobile operating system for iPhones. According to reports by BGR, the keynote is speculated to highlight breakthrough developments that not only improves the user experience but will also be compatible with artificial intelligence, has fluidity between cross-devices, and has a more intelligent design philosophy.Even though Apple has not publicly announced all the features, the leaks and rumors within the industry indicate a bright outlook. With AI-driven health recommendations to live translation through AirPods, iOS 26 will embark on a new path in making the iPhone smarter, smarter, and more personal.Listed below are the rumoured iOS 26 features that could completely transform your iPhone.One of the largest issues with beta software over the past few years has been instability during initial releases. Apple is said to be focusing heavily on foundational performance boosts and more refined beta testing cycles with iOS 26. This translates to fewer bugs, improved resource efficiency, and a cleaner experience across models.iOS 26 is expected to bring a UI redesign inspired by visionOS, the operating system behind Apple's Vision Pro. The new design is speculated to come with translucent features, more simplified menus, and a less prominent interface.Over the years, the Camera app has become a bit troublesome with a lot of toggles and buried options. With iOS 26, Apple can finally simplify this interface, providing a more smooth and distraction-free shooting experience.Fitness and health have been at the heart of Apple's world, but iOS 26 might take it to the next level with the launch of an AI health coach. This would take user information from the Health app and Apple Watch and create personalized fitness and wellness advice.Battery life remains a priority for iPhone users. Apple can solve this with AI-driven battery optimisation, where the operating system learns user habits and optimizes background activity accordingly.Accessing public Wi-Fi, particularly captive networks that demand login screens, can become a chore. iOS 26 might bring a shared login feature that is synced across devices with the same Apple ID.Perhaps the most awaited feature is real-time translation support in AirPods, which would possibly be driven by Apple Intelligence (Apple's own AI suite).From an improved battery life to smarter health tracking and real-time translation, the upcoming iOS 26 features seem aimed at making the iPhone not just a device, but a more intuitive extension of daily life. Stay tuned for Apple’s keynote, where all eyes will be on how many of these speculations actually become reality.","Ios 26 is expected to bring a ui redesign inspired by visionos, the operating system behind apple's vision pro.

Tesla robotaxi launch in Austin: Elon Musk sets 'tentative date'; says 'we are being super paranoid about safety',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/tesla-robotaxi-launch-in-austin-elon-musk-sets-tentative-date-says-we-are-being-super-paranoid-about-safety/articleshow/121766446.cms,"Billionaire Elon Musk announced on Tuesday that the electric vehicle manufacturing giant Tesla is ""tentatively"" set to begin its long-awaited robotaxi service in Austin, Texas, on June 22.Sharing a post on social media platform X, Musk said the launch would take place in Austin, calling the timeline ""tentatively, June 22.""""We are being super paranoid about safety, so the date could shift,"" Musk added.The announcement marks a major step in Tesla's autonomous driving plans. If the rollout happens as planned, it would mark a major milestone in Tesla's Full Self-Driving (FSD) program—a technology that has faced years of delays and criticism.Musk also revealed that the first Tesla to fully ""drive itself from the factory end of line all the way to a customer house is June 28.""Earlier, Musk responded to a video on X showing what appears to be one of Tesla's first robotaxis in Austin, a Model Y carrying a passenger with no driver behind the wheel.The car had a ""Robotaxi"" logo on its side.""These are unmodified Tesla cars coming straight from the factory, meaning that every Tesla coming out of our factories is capable of unsupervised self-driving!"" Musk wrote on X.Investors, analysts, and Tesla fans have been closely watching for this moment since Musk said earlier this year that the robotaxi service would launch in Austin sometime in June.In an interview with CNBC last month, Musk outlined initial plans for the service, stating that the vehicles would operate under remote supervision and ""geofenced"".He indicated plans to begin with approximately 10 vehicles, with rapid expansion planned for other metropolitan areas including Los Angeles, San Antonio and San Francisco.Musk has spent years promising fully self-driving Teslas “next year,” but now the pressure is real as the company begins rolling out its robotaxi service. Tesla's electric vehicle sales have recently dipped, hit by rising competition, the revamp of its popular Model Y, and the backlash from Musk’s political statements.The Austin launch coincides with a reported clash between Musk and US President Donald Trump over tax policy. Some analysts worry this could lead to more scrutiny from federal safety regulators if problems arise with the robotaxis.Still, Wall Street remains hopeful. Earlier, analyst Dan Ives of Wedbush called the launch the ""start of Tesla’s autonomous future and a new growth chapter.""","Billionaire elon musk announced on tuesday that the electric vehicle manufacturing giant tesla is ""tentatively"" set to begin its long-awaited robotaxi service in austin, texas, on june 22.

Sebi's 'verified' UPI to deter scammers posing as brokers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/sebis-verified-upi-to-deter-scammers-posing-as-brokers/articleshow/121789580.cms,"MUMBAI: To counter the increasing menace of stock market related cyber frauds, Sebi on Wednesday said it will launch a verified payment mechanism that will show if investors transferring funds are paying to genuine Sebi-registered entities or not. The new mechanism will be able to weed out fraudulent entities that often copy or mimic genuine Sebi-registered entities to lure investors and defraud them of their money.As part of the comprehensive facility, the UPI payment mechanism for all Sebi-registered intermediaries that collect funds from investors will have a verified sign that investors will be able to see while transferring funds. This will improve the safety and accessibility of financial transactions within the securities market, Sebi said.The UPI payment mechanism will go live from Oct 1, Sebi chairman Tuhin Kanta Pandey, said. He added that the new mechanism will in no way affect the existing mandates and payment mechanisms like RTGS, IMPS, e-NACH, etc., that are already in use for SIPs and other fund transfers by investments.""This innovative mechanism is set to significantly improve the safety and accessibility of financial transactions within the securities market by providing a verified and secure payment channel,"" Pandey said.This mechanism will use a new UPI address structure for all Sebi-registered intermediaries. The new address will be verified at three levels: Sebi, banks, and NPCI.In addition, Sebi is developing another new functionality called 'Sebi Check' that will allow investors to verify the authenticity of UPI IDs either by scanning a QR code or entering the UPI ID manually and confirming the bank details, including the account number and IFSC of a registered intermediary.","The new mechanism will be able to weed out fraudulent entities that often copy or mimic genuine sebi-registered entities.

"In 5 years, 10 mid-tier IT companies join $1 billion club",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/ten-it-firms-join-one-billion-dollar-revenue-club-in-last-five-years/articleshow/121789985.cms,"BENGALURU: Call it the mid-tier IT firm’s breakout moment. Over the past decade, 15 companies crossed the $1 billion revenue mark—10 of them in just the last five years, with several more on the cusp. This marks a structural shift in the mid-tier segment, packing a bigger punch.Take Coforge, for instance. It aims to achieve a revenue milestone of $2 billion by fiscal 2027. The company surpassed $1 billion in revenue during the financial year 2022-23, demonstrating a year-on-year growth of 22.4% in constant currency terms. Digital engineering company Nagarro’s revenue crossed $1 billion in the 2023 financial year, up from $908 million in the corresponding period last year. Nagarro follows a January to December financial year. The company recorded a growth of 9.4% in constant currency in 2023. Of Nagarro’s 18,000 employees, 12,000 are based in India across 12 cities.While these companies were growth-ready, former Cognizant India CMD Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, in a LinkedIn post, said three powerful forces have redefined their trajectory. Seasoned leaders from tier-1 firms brought strategic clarity, global perspective, and execution muscle—sharpening the edge of mid-tier companies.Private equity as a growth engine and an imbibed long-term value mindset accelerated transformation and scaling ambitions. Mid-tier players rapidly built and scaled advanced digital capabilities—closely aligned with evolving client expectations.Ramamoorthy said, “One of the best things that happened to Indian IT after Y2K is senior management attrition. Seasoned leaders who built and ran large portfolios in IT companies such as Cognizant, Infosys, and HCL took on CXO roles in mid-sized firms and built the much-needed muscles to gracefully scale these companies. With more such leaders being made available today, in the years to come, we should see a larger number of companies get past the magical $1 billion in revenue, ably compete with Tier-1 players, and catalyse growth. ” He is also a partner in tech growth advisory firm Catalincs.In the last four months, nearly a dozen mid-sized firms saw top deck changes. LTIMindtree welcomed Venu Lambu as their new chief executive, while Virtusa brought in Nitin Banga from Global Logic to lead as their CEO. Rohit Kedia, who brings 28 years of experience in technology and digital engineering, was appointed CEO at ChrysCapital-owned digital engineering company Xoriant. He previously served as chief growth officer at LTIMindtree. Engineering services firm Cyient appointed Sukamal Banerjee as CEO of its DET (digital, engineering and technology) business.“Also, with dozens of PE firms making a beeline for the IT industry, the investee companies are a big draw for these leaders not only for CXO roles but also for Board positions. These firms bring in global best practices across all aspects of business—people, process, platforms, partnerships, among others—which also helps fast-track the journey to a billion dollars and more.”Peter Bendor-Samuel, founder and chairman of US-based IT advisory Everest Group, said, “However, perhaps the most important factor has been the PE firm’s ability to change the mindset of these firms and attract some of the industry’s most capable executives to run them. The combination of first-rate executives, acquisitions, and focused investments in sales and marketing has proven a sure-fire recipe to drive highly profitable and fast growth. ”These shifts have repositioned mid-tier companies as credible contenders, not just fast followers—rewriting what growth looks like in the industry’s next chapter.","Over the past decade, 15 companies crossed the $1 billion revenue mark. 10 of them in just the last five years, with several more on the cusp.

BSE share price plunges: BSE Ltd shares declined 4% to Rs 2,885.20 on the NSE on Wednesday after the exchange placed the stock under Additional Surveillance Measure (ASM) framework, leading to wariness amongst investors.BSE share price has increased by 116.6% over three months and 225.6% in the past year. BSE shares have risen approximately 32% in the previous month and 58.5% over six months. The substantial appreciation in share value likely prompted regulatory attention, as exchanges commonly implement ASM measures to address excessive volatility and speculation.The ASM framework serves as a regulatory instrument utilised by exchanges to supervise and regulate unusual price fluctuations. Securities under ASM face stricter oversight and trading constraints, including elevated margin requirements and restrictions on intraday transactions, aimed at protecting investors and ensuring market stability.The inclusion follows a notable increase in BSE's share price and trading volume. Stock exchanges generally incorporate shares into the ASM category when they observe substantial price movements unsupported by fundamental factors or unusual trading patterns, according to an ET report.BSE shares currently maintain positions above most crucial simple moving averages (SMAs), specifically the 10-day, 20-day, 30-day, 50-day, 100-day, 150-day, and 200-day markers. The stock has, however, dipped beneath the 5-day SMA, indicating recent softening in performance, the report said.The RSI reading of 80.9 exceeds the overbought level of 70, suggesting a potential downward correction. Nevertheless, the MACD maintains a strong positive value of 208.2, positioned above its centre and signal lines, which confirms ongoing bullish sentiment despite the midweek decline.BSE has demonstrated remarkable financial performance, with its recent stock surge supported by exceptional fourth-quarter results.
