What is Indian ePassport & is it mandatory for current passport holders to replace theirs with a new chip-based one?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/what-is-indian-epassport-is-it-mandatory-for-current-passport-holders-to-replace-theirs-with-a-new-chip-based-one/articleshow/121316262.cms,"Visa Revokes, Rising Costs, & Trump 2.0: Should Indian Students Still Choose the U.S. in 2025?

Key benefits of ePassport



Enhanced Data Security: The ePassport stores information both in printed form and as a digitally signed electronic chip. Immigration officials worldwide can authenticate this data, reducing the risk of forgery and fraudulent passports.

Robust Encryption: Protected by Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), the ePassport’s chip ensures the integrity and origin of personal and biometric data.

International Standards Compliance: Following ICAO Document 9303 guidelines, the ePassport uses:

Basic Access Control (BAC): Restricts chip access to authorised scanning devices. Passive Authentication (PA): Verifies stored data and detects tampering. Extended Access Control (EAC): Adds an extra security layer for sensitive biometric information like fingerprints.

Streamlined Immigration: Biometric verification via ePassport allows automated and contactless checks at border control, significantly lowering wait times and easing the travel experience.

Global Compatibility: As ePassports meet ICAO specifications, they are accepted at checkpoints in most countries, simplifying international travel.

Fraud Prevention: Advanced security features make it difficult to tamper with or duplicate passports, deterring counterfeiters and protecting individual identities.

Traveler Convenience: Automated e-gates at airports enable ePassport holders to pass through immigration faster without manual inspections.

National Security: Including biometric data in passports strengthens border control by more accurately tracking cross-border movement and preventing identity theft.

Simplified Updates: Electronic storage makes renewing or updating personal details more efficient, speeding up the application process.

Digital Transformation: The ePassport supports India’s move toward paperless travel and digital identities, paving the way for future innovations in global mobility.

Is replacement mandatory for current Passport holders?



NEW DELHI: The Government of India has introduced the ePassport which is a combined paper and electronic passport featuring an embedded RFID chip and antenna.The chip securely stores the passport holder’s personal and biometric data and is visually identified by a small gold-coloured symbol on the front cover.With this rollout, India joins over 120 countries, including the United States, Canada, France, Japan, and Australia, in issuing biometric e-passports.This move aligns India with ICAO international standards and represents a major step forward in enhancing national security and streamlining cross-border travel.As global travel rebounds and border security becomes ever more critical, the ePassport equips Indian travellers with a safer, smoother experience abroad. By adopting biometric technology, India underscores its commitment to digital innovation and positions itself at the forefront of modern identity management.No, existing passports issued by the Government of India remain valid until their official expiry date. ePassports will be issued gradually as each Passport Office becomes technically equipped. This phased rollout across all Passport Offices in India may take a few months.Until then, holders of regular passports do not need to replace them.",The government of india has introduced the epassport which is a combined paper and electronic passport featuring an embedded rfid chip and antenna.

What led to Alijah Arenas’ life-threatening accident? Father Gilbert Arenas claims reason behind the Tesla Cybertruck crash,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/what-led-to-alijah-arenas-life-threatening-accident-father-gilbert-arenas-claims-reason-behind-the-cybertruck-crash/articleshow/121306231.cms,"Alijah Arenas and Gilbert Arenas.

Gilbert Arenas revealed the reason behind Alijah Arenas’ life-threatening accident

In late April, former NBA star Gilbert Arenas faced every parent’s worst nightmare. His son, Alijah Arenas , an 18-year-old basketball phenom committed to USC, was involved in a terrifying car crash while driving a Tesla Cybertruck. The vehicle struck a tree and a fire hydrant in Los Angeles’ San Fernando Valley and burst into flames, leaving Alijah trapped inside. Now, Gilbert has shared new details answering the burning question of what led to the horrific crash.The crash happened around 5 a.m. on April 24. Alijah Arenas, who was behind the wheel, inhaled a large amount of smoke and had to be placed in a medically induced coma. Fortunately, he didn’t suffer any broken bones. He was released from the hospital six days later and is now recovering at home under close medical watch. But the story behind the crash has raised troubling questions about the Tesla Cybertruck’s safety.Appearing on the All The Smoke podcast, Gilbert Arenas explained what really happened. “The car malfunctioned on him. The steering wheel went limp and ran him right into a tree,” he said, rejecting speculation that his son had fallen asleep at the wheel.Arenas added that Alijah was on the phone with 911 for nearly 10 minutes while the vehicle burned around him. “He couldn’t break the window,” he said. “Physically, he said he was trying to kick the window in and couldn’t. If you’re a parent and your teen has this car, you might want to put a hammer in that joint.” The Tesla Cybertruck's shatter-resistant, bulletproof glass, marketed as a selling point, made it nearly impossible for Alijah to escape.According to a family statement shared by TMZ, the rescue effort came down to sheer determination and luck. One good Samaritan recounted hearing banging from inside the car: “I couldn’t see anything because the smoke was so thick.” Eventually, a slight crack in one of the windows allowed bystanders to pry it open and pull Alijah out. “The car was on fire. We just knew we had to get him out.”Gilbert revealed how emotional it was to see his son alive after the ordeal. “Once he got his personality back… our jokes came back and I’m like, ‘Damn boy, you almost went extra crispy on me man.’” He said he used the moment to remind Alijah of how rare second chances are. “You’re a lucky one to see this,” he told him. “Most people don’t get to see the flowers and how everyone reacts when something happens… You can’t take this sh-t for granted. ”Since the crash, Tesla has not issued a public statement about the alleged malfunction. Meanwhile, the Arenas family is focused on Alijah’s recovery.Also Read: Minnesota Timberwolves vs Oklahoma City Thunder (05/20): Box score, player stats, game summary and more Alijah’s basketball career is still on track, and with USC on the horizon.

NFL rookie Ashton Jeanty gives up Mercedes-level cash for Jersey No. 2,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-rookie-ashton-jeanty-gives-up-mercedes-level-cash-for-jersey-no-2/articleshow/121322981.cms,"Ashton Jeanty drops Mercedes cash for jersey number (Image via: Getty Images)

Ashton Jeanty ’s pricey Jersey deal raises eyebrows across NFL



Before taking a single snap in the NFL, Ashton Jeanty is already making headlines, not for his talent, but for reportedly shelling out close to $100,000 to claim jersey No. 2 from Raiders veteran kicker Daniel Carlson . While some admire the move, others are calling it tone-deaf. Has the NFL’s jersey culture shifted from tradition to transaction? Las Vegas Raiders rookie Ashton Jeanty, the No. 6 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, is known for torching college defenses at Boise State. But now, he’s drawing attention for something else entirely, allegedly paying a six-figure sum to acquire his beloved jersey number from a teammate. And fans across the league have mixed feelings.In a recent appearance on Up and Adams, Jeanty revealed that he reached out to Raiders kicker Daniel Carlson to negotiate for jersey No. 2. “I called him and I’m like, ‘I’m trying to get that No. 2. I got to drop that little bag for No. 2,” Jeanty said, joking that the deal cost enough to buy a Mercedes GLE worth around $100,000.Jersey numbers in the NFL have always held deep personal meaning. For some, it’s a symbol of their journey; for others, it’s part of their identity. But when a rookie walks into the building and immediately throws down serious cash to take a veteran’s number, it doesn’t sit well with everyone. Critics argue that it sends the wrong message—that flash and status now outweigh respect and merit.Carlson, one of the league’s most consistent kickers and a Raider since 2018, agreed to the swap. Did Jeanty cross an unwritten locker room line? Or is this just business as usual in today’s NFL?Given Jeanty’s résumé—4,769 rushing yards, 56 total touchdowns, two All-American selections, and a Heisman Trophy runner-up finish—it’s understandable why he wants to keep No. 2. It’s the number he built his brand around, and with offensive coordinator Chip Kelly already tweaking his role, clinging to something familiar might give him comfort.Also Read: Eagles win off the field as NFL keeps “Tush Push” legal despite backlash Still, the optics are jarring.

Poll Do you think AI will replace more jobs in the future? No, humans will always be needed. Yes, it's inevitable.

To those also affected—you're not alone, we're at least 6,000, says Microsoft's fired AI director

Microsoft's second biggest layoffs ever hits over 6,000 employees



Microsoft announced last week that it is laying off approximately 6,000 employees, nearly 3% of its global workforce—in what marks the company's second-largest job reduction in its history. Among those affected was Gabriela de Queiroz , Director of Artificial Intelligence for Microsoft for Startups , who shared the ""bittersweet news"" of her departure on social media.""I was impacted by Microsoft's latest round of layoffs. Am I sad? Absolutely. I'm heartbroken to see so many talented people I've had the honor of working with being let go. These are people who cared deeply, went above and beyond, and truly made a difference,"" Gabriela de Queiroz wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter), alongside a picture of herself smiling.The layoffs come as Microsoft aggressively pushes into artificial intelligence, with CEO Satya Nadella revealing in April that AI now writes up to 30% of code in some Microsoft projects. Software engineers bore the brunt of the cuts, representing over 40% of the approximately 2,000 positions eliminated in Washington state alone, according to Bloomberg analysis.Despite being asked to stop work immediately and set an out-of-office message, Gabriela de Queiroz chose to stay longer. ""I chose to stay a little longer—showing up for meetings, saying goodbye, wrapping up what I could. That felt right to me,"" she explained in her social media posts.The irony of laying off an AI director while the company invests heavily in AI technology wasn't lost on industry observers. One Microsoft vice president recently told his team to use AI chatbots to generate half their computer code, up from the current 20-30%, before more than a dozen engineers on his team were subsequently laid off.""But if you know me, you know I always look at the bright side. I'm an optimist at heart. That hasn't changed. My smile, my gratitude, my belief that each day is a gift—that's all still here,"" Gabriela de Queiroz wrote, maintaining her positive outlook despite the circumstances.The cuts affect all levels, teams, and geographies as Microsoft streamlines operations and reduces management layers. ""What's next? I don't know yet. It's too soon to say. But I trust that something good will come out of this,"" Gabriela de Queiroz concluded, addressing fellow impacted employees: ""To those also affected—you're not alone. We are at least 6,000.""In another news, a Microsoft employee disrupted the company’s annual developer conference, Build 2025, in Seattle on May 19. The employee protested against the company’s Cloud and AI work with the Israeli government.Microsoft recently announced it will lay off 3% of its global workforce, affecting thousands of employees across all levels, teams, and geographies, amounting to over 6,000 employees. The cuts at the Redmond giant, which employed 228,000 people as of last June, aim to reduce management layers and streamline operations.In a related news, Microsoft's Build 2025 event faced disruption as an employee, Joe Lopez, protested against the company's contracts with the Israeli government, shouting slogans like 'Free Palestine'. This follows similar protests at Microsoft's 50th-anniversary celebrations. Lopez, a Microsoft Azure veteran, claims the company's technology aids in harming Palestinian civilians, a claim Microsoft denies.","Microsoft layoffs 2025 hit 6,000 employees worldwide, including ai director gabriela de queiroz.

Who is Indian-Origin executive Vaibhav Taneja? Tesla CFO earns a record $139 million salary,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/who-is-indian-origin-executive-vaibhav-taneja-tesla-cfo-earns-a-record-139-million-salary/articleshow/121300085.cms,"

Vaibhav Taneja’s journey: From Delhi University to Wall Street

Climbing Tesla’s ranks

The $139 million pay package: Why it stands out

A high salary amid Tesla’s challenges

The man behind the numbers

Vaibhav Taneja , the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) of Tesla is making global headlines by earning a staggering $139.5 million in total salary for the year 2024. It is one of the highest pay packages ever awarded to a CFO. The bulk of this figure came from stock options and equity awards granted following his promotion, far surpassing his base salary of $400,000. This extraordinary compensation exceeded the earnings of top tech leaders like Satya Nadella and Sundar Pichai, placing Taneja in the spotlight as one of the most highly paid finance executives in corporate history. Taneja’s salary is not just a number; it’s a symbol of Tesla’s high-stakes leadership culture.Vaibhav Taneja’s journey began in India. He earned a Bachelor of Commerce degree from Delhi University in 1999, became a Chartered Accountant through the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India in 2000, and later qualified as a Certified Public Accountant (CPA) in the U.S. in 2006.He spent nearly 17 years at PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) in India and the U.S., where he rose to Senior Manager in Assurance. In 2016, he joined SolarCity, the solar energy firm later acquired by Tesla, marking the beginning of his journey with the electric vehicle giant. From a Delhi classroom to Silicon Valley boardrooms, Taneja’s rise is remarkable.After the SolarCity merger in 2017, Taneja joined Tesla as Assistant Corporate Controller. He quickly moved up the ladder: promoted to Corporate Controller in 2018, appointed Chief Accounting Officer in 2019, and eventually elevated to Chief Financial Officer in August 2023, succeeding Zach Kirkhorn. He now also serves as a director at Tesla India Motors and Energy Private Limited, playing a key role in Tesla’s Indian expansion strategy. His ascent reflects not just skill, but deep trust from Tesla’s top brass.Taneja’s record-breaking $139.5 million compensation package is largely stock-based and designed to vest over four years. At the time of the award, Tesla shares were valued near $250, but by May 2025, the stock had risen to $342, making the award even more lucrative.His pay eclipsed Satya Nadella's $79.1 million and Sundar Pichai’s $10.7 million in the same year. It also beat the previous CFO compensation record of $86 million set by Nikola’s CFO in 2020. In an era of scrutiny, his pay package has reignited debates over executive compensation. This places Taneja in a unique class of corporate executives.Taneja’s compensation comes as Tesla navigates turbulent waters: declining EV deliveries, shrinking margins, and rising global competition. While critics question such high executive payouts, others argue that rewarding leaders with strong financial stewardship is critical for steering through volatile market conditions.Meanwhile, Elon Musk , Tesla’s CEO, is battling legal challenges related to his own voided $56 billion pay package, further intensifying scrutiny of Tesla’s executive pay structures.Known for his quiet competence rather than flamboyance, Taneja is often described as a steady, strategic leader with deep expertise in financial operations and corporate integration. His success story serves as inspiration for professionals worldwide, especially from the Indian diaspora. In a world chasing charisma, Taneja’s quiet precision is making waves.With over two decades of experience, Taneja now stands at the helm of Tesla’s financial strategy — proving that technical skills, global adaptability, and the ability to navigate complex corporate landscapes can lead to extraordinary success.",Vaibhav taneja is the chief financial officer (cfo) of tesla.

Amid privacy push, Telegram’s viral contest takes aim at WhatsApp

Pavel Durov’s recent statements on political pressures

Implications for users and content creators



Contest evaluation and future prospects



In the highly competitive landscape of instant messaging platforms, Telegram, a popular messaging app founded by Pavel Durov , has initiated a bold new contest aimed at content creators. The competition offers a prize pool of $50,000 for a viral video that underscores Telegram’s claim of being the original innovator in messaging technology — years ahead of its competitor WhatsApp, which Telegram labels a “cheap copycat.”This initiative marks Telegram’s first contest designed specifically for content creators, signaling the company’s increased focus on leveraging user-generated content to raise awareness about its platform’s unique features and capabilities. The contest was announced on May 19, 2025, by Pavel Durov himself, and aims to counteract alleged smear campaigns against Telegram by WhatsApp. With a submission deadline set for May 26, 2025, the campaign encourages participation from global audiences, aiming to clarify Telegram’s contributions to the messaging industry.Telegram and WhatsApp are two of the largest messaging platforms worldwide, both competing for dominance in the instant communication space. WhatsApp, owned by Meta Platforms Inc., boasts over two billion users globally, while Telegram, known for its focus on privacy and advanced features, has seen rapid growth, particularly in regions emphasizing secure messaging. The rivalry has intensified over the years, with Telegram frequently highlighting its pioneering features that WhatsApp later incorporated, and vice versa.Pavel Durov, Telegram’s CEO and founder, has publicly accused WhatsApp of conducting smear campaigns against Telegram, aiming to undermine its reputation. In response, Telegram’s new contest serves as a public relations strategy to emphasize Telegram’s innovative edge and solidify its position among messaging app users.The contest invites participants to create a viral video no longer than three minutes (180 seconds) that celebrates Telegram’s technological advancements and innovation history relative to WhatsApp. Key aspects of the contest include:Telegram provides participants with a curated list of 30 key features that the app introduced before WhatsApp adopted similar functionalities. However, Pavel Durov notes that the list is not exhaustive and that many. Telegram features still have no counterparts on WhatsApp.Telegram has long promoted its role as an innovator in the messaging app industry. The platform introduced a variety of features now commonplace in WhatsApp and other competitors, including:This innovation-driven branding underpins Telegram’s appeal to privacy-conscious users, tech enthusiasts, and developers worldwide.The contest arrives at a time when Telegram is increasingly positioning itself as a privacy-focused alternative to mainstream messaging apps. This strategy is part of a broader trend among users concerned about data privacy, censorship, and control over digital communication platforms.Simultaneously, Telegram’s open nature and support for bots and APIs have made it popular among developers and businesses seeking customizable communication tools. The contest, therefore, not only serves marketing objectives but also reinforces Telegram’s identity as a technology leader.In conjunction with the contest announcement, Pavel Durov addressed additional political pressures Telegram faces globally. On his Telegram channel, he claimed that a Western European government (implied to be France) had requested Telegram to silence conservative political voices in Romania ahead of the country’s presidential elections held on May 18, 2025. Durov stated that Telegram refused the request, emphasizing the platform’s commitment to protecting political freedom and user rights without blocking political channels.This statement underscores Telegram’s stance on political neutrality and freedom of expression, positioning the platform as resistant to government censorship demands.The contest opens opportunities for a wide range of content creators, including video producers, social media influencers, and digital marketers. By incentivizing creative promotion of Telegram’s features, the company aims to increase its user base and engagement on emerging social media platforms, where short-form videos dominate.Participants are encouraged to leverage contemporary digital marketing techniques, meme culture, and AI tools to maximize video reach and impact. The contest guidelines emphasize the importance of clear messaging, visual appeal, and potential for viral spread.The submitted videos will be reviewed and scored based on predefined metrics by Telegram’s evaluation panel, with winners announced in June 2025. This approach highlights Telegram’s commitment to community-driven content creation as part of its marketing and brand positioning strategy.If successful, the contest could set a precedent for future content initiatives designed to engage users creatively, leveraging social media trends to amplify Telegram’s messaging about innovation and privacy.",Telegram ceo pavel durov launches $50k viral video contest to expose whatsapp’s 'cheap copycat' moves.

OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, Google’s Sundar Pichai calls R1 ‘impressive’

Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has praised the Chinese artificial intelligence (AI) startup DeepSeek’s flagship model, R1, saying that it is the first large language model (LLM) that he’s seen to rival OpenAI’s performance – essentially keeping it on a higher pedestal than Google’s Gemini and the one that powers Grok, the AI chatbot by Elon Musk’s AI company, xAI.“OpenAI has been so far ahead that no one's really come close,” Satya Nadella told Bloomberg Businessweek.“DeepSeek, and R1 in particular, was the first model I’ve seen post some points,” added Nadella.Microsoft began offering R1 through its Azure AI Foundry in January, alongside models from OpenAI, Meta and Mistral. Microsoft VP Asha Sharma said R1 underwent “rigorous red teaming and safety evaluations” before being made available, and emphasized that data processed through Azure would not be routed to DeepSeek’s servers in China.DeepSeek made waves earlier this year when it launched R1, impressing both the tech industry and investors. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman acknowledged the competition, calling R1 “an impressive model” and noting its strong performance at a lower cost. He added that DeepSeek’s emergence prompted OpenAI to accelerate some product releases.Even Google CEO Sundar Pichai acknowledged the ‘impressive work’ of DeepSeek's team Alphabet’s Q4 2024 earnings call earlier this year.“I think [DeepSeek has] a tremendous team. I think they've done very, very good work,” Pichai said.R1’s popularity surged in January when its free chatbot app topped Apple’s US App Store, sparking concerns among investors about potential impacts on demand for AI hardware like Nvidia chips. DeepSeek’s ability to deliver high-quality models at a lower price triggered a sell-off in AI-related stocks.However, Ben Buchanan, an AI advisor in the former US President Joe Biden administration, suggested that the hype may be exxagerated and overstated.“DeepSeek’s engineers are extremely talented,” he said on The Ezra Klein Show, adding that their breakthroughs are largely in line with algorithmic efficiency work seen across the industry.","Microsoft ceo satya nadella praises deepseek's flagship model, r1.

"Google unveils AI chatbot, signalling a new era for search",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/google-unveils-ai-chatbot-signalling-a-new-era-for-search/articleshow/121326870.cms,"Sundar Pichai, Google CE





MOUNTAIN VIEW: Google became the gateway to the internet by perfecting its search engine. For two decades, it surfaced 10 blue links that gave people access to the information they were looking for.But after a quarter century, the tech giant is betting that the future of search will be artificial intelligence. On Tuesday, Google said it was introducing a new feature in its search engine called AI Mode. The tool will function like a chatbot, allowing people to start a query, ask follow-up questions and use the company's AI system to deliver comprehensive answers.""It's a total reimagining of search,"" said Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, in a press briefing before the company's annual conference for software developers. In tests of the feature, he said people dramatically ""changed the nature of how they are interacting with search.""The new feature headlined a list of new AI abilities, including more personalised and automated email replies and a shopping tool to automatically purchase clothing after it's put on sale.With the introduction of AI Mode, Google is essentially trying to disrupt its traditional search business before upstart AI competitors can disrupt it. The search giant has been nervous about that possibility since declaring a ""code red"" two years ago after the arrival of ChatGPT, a chatbot from OpenAI that ignited a race to add generative AI into tech products.But Google has been hesitant to fully embrace AI because it has so much to lose. The company's search business generated nearly $200 billion last year, more than half of its total sales. And the bedrock of that business has been how it has reliably provided people with the best answers to questions.Though they are a technical leap, AI systems have one big shortcoming: They are prone to giving incorrect answers, like recommending people eat rocks, which one of Google's AI systems did last year.AI might have already begun to cut into Google's popularity as the default for finding digital information. During testimony in a justice department antitrust case against Google this May, one of Apple's top executives, Eddy Cue, said Google search traffic declined for the first time in 22 years because more people are using AI. Google said afterward that it continued to ""see overall query growth"" in search.""They hesitated on this for a long time because they didn't think the quality was good or know how to monetise it,"" said Pete Meyers, the principal innovation architect at Moz, a software company focused on search engine optimization that tracks changes to Google Search. ""Now they're doing what they think they have to do to compete, and it's uncomfortable."" AI Mode, which launched in the US on Tuesday, won't serve ads initially. Google is holding an event for marketers and advertisers on Wednesday where it could unveil more.","Google is introducing a new feature in its search engine called ai mode.

LONDON: British pop legend Elton John branded the UK government ""absolute losers"" on Sunday over planned copyright law changes that would hand exemptions to tech firms.In a blistering interview broadcast by the BBC, ""Rocket Man"" star John said he felt ""incredibly betrayed"" and accused the government of preparing to ""rob young people of their legacy and their income"".The changes which he branded ""criminal"" would allow tech firms to use creators' content freely unless the rights holders opt out.But John, 78, who has sold over 300 million records worldwide in his decades-long career, said young artists did not have the resources ""to fight big tech"".He said he was not against artificial intelligence (AI) but that when it came to music and creativity a line should be drawn.The government's Data (Use and Access) Bill is currently going through parliament.The parliament's upper house supported an amendment designed to ensure copyright holders would have to give permission over whether their work was used and, in turn, see what elements had been taken, by who and when.But on Wednesday MPs in the lower house, in which the Labour government has a huge majority, voted down the changes.If the government's planned changes to copyright laws went ahead they would be ""committing theft, thievery on a high scale"", John told the BBC's Sunday with Laura Kuenssberg programme.""The government are just being absolute losers and I'm very angry about it,"" John said, blasting Technology Secretary Peter Kyle as a ""bit of a moron"".Prime Minister Keir Starmer has previously said the government needs to ""get the balance right"" with copyright and AI while noting that the technology represented ""a huge opportunity"".""They have no right to sell us down the river,"" John added, urging Starmer to ""wise up"" and ""see sense"".More than 1,000 musicians including Kate Bush, Annie Lennox and Damon Albarn released a silent album in February to protest at the proposed changes, saying they would legalise music theft.Earlier this month, writers and musicians including John and Bush also condemned the proposals as a ""wholesale giveaway"" to Silicon Valley in a letter to The Times newspaper.Other signatories included musicians Paul McCartney, Ed Sheeran, Dua Lipa and Sting, and writers Kazuo Ishiguro, Michael Morpurgo and Helen Fielding.A Department for Science, Innovation and Technology spokesperson said the bill was focused on ""unlocking the secure and effective use of data for the public interest -- boosting the economy by an estimated £10 billion over the course of the next 10 years"".","Elton john says he feels ""incredibly betrayed"" over planned copyright law changes.

French lawmakers move to stop annoying telemarketer calls,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/french-lawmakers-move-to-stop-annoying-telemarketer-calls/articleshow/121322322.cms,"Representative AI image





The French parliament moved Wednesday to stop telemarketers making annoying, unsolicited phone calls, with measures due to come into force in just over a year.Under the legislation, passed in a senate vote, it will be up to a company to prove that a call made on their behalf to an individual's telephone was done so with the person's express consent.The only exception would be when the company is calling to carry out an already-agreed contract.According to an October 2024 survey by French consumer group UFC-Que Choisir, 97 percent of people in France have expressed irritation at the cold calls.Often the telemarketers use different phone numbers from different geographic areas as a tactic to place the calls about heat pumps, changing utility or cell phone providers, installing windows, or other transactions.The lawmakers, backed by the government, decided to erect a law against the cold-callers after seeing that a French service, Bloctel, meant to prevent such spam calls, was not working.One Frenchwoman, Lucie Kapfer, 43, said she got rid of her landline after receiving ""several calls each week"" from unwanted telemarketers.""But they continued on my mobile phone. Several calls a day, it was sheer hell,"" she said.The French government was also concerned by how many of the calls were about arranging fraudulent access to publicly funded schemes, such as training programmes or subsidies for making homes more energy efficient.The law will protect ""the more vulnerable people, the elderly, those who sometimes don't realise that this harassment by telephone is only an entry point to massive fraud schemes"", said the minister for public accounts, Amelie de Montchalin.The law is scheduled to come into effect in August 2026.Companies ""will have a year to organise themselves"" to comply with the law, but after that ""there will be no exceptions,"" said the senator Pierre-Jean Verzelen, who promoted the measure.Spain, too, is looking at taking action against telemarketers. Its government last week said it wants telecom operators to block calls from firms not using a dedicated prefix identifying them as commercial callers.","French parliament moves to stop telemarketers making annoying, unsolicited phone calls. 97 percent of people in france have expressed irritation at the cold calls.

Beyond baseball: Trout's expanding business portfolio

Mike Trout continues to make headlines in 2025—not just for his on-field performance, but for his impressive net worth, massive MLB salary, and personal life. Here's a closer look at how the Angels’ superstar has built his fortune, what he earns today, and the woman by his side through it all.Mike Trout, star centerfielder for the Angels, has become one of MLB’s wealthiest players with a $140 million fortune in 2025. His record-setting 12-year, $426.5 million contract and endorsements from brands like Nike and Subway bring in over $50 million annually, keeping his finances strong despite recent injuries.Mike Trout shares his wealth with high school sweetheart Jessica Cox , whom he married after meeting in Spanish class at Millville Senior High School in December 2017. The couple is the parents of Beckham Aaron, who was born in 2020, and Jordy Michael, who was born in 2024. They have two dogs, Juno and Josie.They now live in a large Newport Beach mansion that cost $9.15 million when it was purchased in 2019.
