Privacy alarm rings as govt directs smartphone makers to pre-load Sanchar Saathi app,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/privacy-alarm-rings-as-govt-directs-smartphone-makers-to-pre-load-sanchar-saathi-app/articleshow/125699029.cms,"Sanchar Saathi mobile app

In what raises privacy concerns and fears around state surveillance, govt has asked smartphone makers to mandatorily pre-install its Sanchar Saathi app on their devices, ostensibly to strengthen cyber security on the devices and prevent tampering and spoofing of IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number.The order, originally issued on November 21, gives the device makers – ranging from Apple, Samsung, Google, Motorola, and the Chinese lot of Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo – 90 days to comply with the regulation or otherwise face penalties. The govt’s order is even valid for devices being imported to the country, or still in pre-sales transit.The direction -- that raised red flags within the industry as well as privacy advocates -- said, “Central govt hereby directs every manufacturer and importers of mobile handsets that are intended for use in India to… ensure that the Sanchar Saathi mobile application, as specified by Department of Telecom (DoT), is pre-installed on all mobile handsets manufactured or imported for use in India.”And to ensure that the exercise does not end up as mere eyewash, the order also asks the companies to ensure that the pre-installed Sanchar Saathi app is “readily visible and accessible to the end users” at the time of first use or device setup and that “its functionalities are not disabled or restricted”.The order said that a provision to follow the instructions should also be made for devices which are in transit for sales.“For all such devices that have already been manufactured and are in sales channels in India, the manufacturer and importers of mobile handsets shall make an endeavour to push the App through software updates.”Sanchar Saathi is pitched as a citizen-centric initiative of DoT that promises to “empower mobile subscribers, strengthen their security” while increasing awareness about govt initiatives.The direction has been given under the Telecommunications (Telecom Cyber Security) Rules, 2024, and its further amendments. “Rule 5 of the Rules empowers the govt to establish digital or other mechanisms necessary to identify and report acts that may endanger telecom cyber security, and accordingly, the DoT has instituted the Sanchar Saathi App, that, inter-alia, enables stakeholders to report IMEI related suspicious misuse and also to verify authenticity of IMEIs used in mobile devices,” the order said.The order said that mobile handsets bearing duplicate or spoofed IMEI pose serious danger to telecom cyber security.Govt instructed the manufacturer and importers of mobile handsets to submit compliance reports to the DoT within 120 days from issue of the directions. “Failure to comply with these directions shall attract action under the Telecommunications Act, 2023, the Telecom Cyber Security Rules, 2024 (as amended), and other applicable laws.”","Sanchar saathi mobile app is pitched as a citizen-centric initiative of dot.

The WhatsApp Scam That Gives Hackers Your Phone!

NEW DELHI: In just under three months, you will not be able to maintain your desktop/computer login on communication apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram, Signal and Snapchat for more than six hours at a stretch. You will have to re-login using the QR code provided by the app provider. Also, if you try to log into your communication apps on smartphones without the SIM card on which you first downloaded the app, it will not connect.This follows new orders issued by govt that say that communication apps should not allow connections on smartphones where the SIM card on which the user was originally identified is missing. The move is being taken to counter cyber fraud. Companies have to comply or face penalties. ""Failure to comply with these directions shall attract action under the Telecommunications Act, 2023 , the Telecom Cyber Security Rules, 2024 (as amended), and other applicable laws,"" govt said.The department of telecom said the current set-up was being misused by cyber fraudsters. ""... it has come to the notice of central govt that some of the app-based communication services that are utilizing mobile number for identification of its customers/users or for provisioning or delivery of services, allows users to consume their services without availability of the underlying Subscriber Identity Module (SIM) within the device in which app-based communication services is running,"" the department of telecom said, adding that the feature was posing a challenge to telecom cyber security ""as it is being misused from outside the country to commit cyber-frauds"".DoT said it had become necessary to issue the directions to prevent the misuse of telecommunication identifiers and to safeguard the integrity and security of the telecom ecosystem.DoT issued the orders on Nov 21. ""From 90 days of issue of these instructions, ensure that the app-based communication services are continuously linked to the SIM card (associated with mobile number used for identification of customers/users or for provisioning or delivery of services) installed in the device, making it impossible to use the app without that specific, active SIM,"" it said.On the web service on computers, it said, ""From 90 days of issue of these instructions, ensure the web service instance of the mobile app, if provided, shall be logged out periodically (not later than 6 hours) and allow the facility to the user to re-link the device using QR code.""It asked the companies to submit compliance reports within 120 days from the issue of the directions.","You will have to re-login using the qr code provided by the app provider.

IITs bar from placement drive 20+ companies that rescinded offers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iits-bar-from-placement-drive-20-companies-that-rescinded-offers/articleshow/125706903.cms,"An IIT professor said the institutes have also decided to emphasise more on participation by start-ups promoted by Centre under Viksit Bharat scheme

MUMBAI: Even as the placement season began across the premier IITs on Monday, more than 20 companies were banned from participating this year. These firms had rescinded job offers made to students in the last academic year, some even as late as June or July this year, at the time of joining. Since many IITs do not allow students with existing offers to sit for further interviews, such late withdrawals not only jeopardised career prospects but also affected students’ mental well-being, said officials. IITs, therefore, unanimously decided to ban these companies from the current placement cycle. IITs tried helping the concerned students despite the time lapse.The list of banned companies was finalised after these firms revoked offers at more than one IIT. Some of them are data analytics and software-based firms. They, however, are allowed to place students through off-campus process.An IIT professor involved in the placement process said the names of the companies were cross-verified by placement coordinators at 15 IITs recently. “We looked at their past records too. Some of these companies had a history of revoking offers and six to seven IITs had already banned them from participation.Offers have been revoked by some companies where some alumni are working. There were also a few companies that reduced salary packages offered in the letter. The placement cells are trying to speak to higher authorities in these companies,” said the professor.Speaking about such cancellations, a computer science graduate from IIT-Bombay’s batch of 2025, said he was hired by a trading platform last December and his joining date was June 1, 2025. “My offer was revoked on May 29. The company made me an offer of nearly Rs 30 lakh and I was more than happy to join. They revoked my offer just two days before I was supposed to join, but fortunately, I got a better offer through an alumnus in some time. Though IIT-Bombay extended help, I did not need it at that time,” said the graduate. He said some of his friends’ offers were revoked too, but a few of them landed other offers. “By June and July it becomes difficult for the institutes too to help with placements as phase-II of the process concludes by the end of the academic year,” he said.The professor added that the IITs this year have also decided to emphasise more on participation by start-ups promoted by the Centre under the Viksit Bharat programme. “The job market is slow, but we are trying to reach out to many more companies and encourage start-ups incubated on prominent campuses to reach the best targets,” he said, adding that so far the placement season looks good.","Firms had rescinded job offers made to students in the last academic year.

NAGPUR: Nishant Agarwal, a scientist at BrahMos Aerospace Limited, who was arrested in 2018 for allegedly passing sensitive defense secrets to Pakistan intelligence operatives, has been absolved of the major charges under the Information Technology Act and the Official Secrets Act.The lower court had earlier sentenced Agarwal to 14 years in prison for allegedly using IT systems to transmit classified information to adversaries of the country. However, in a significant development, the higher judiciary has now cleared him of these charges.The only conviction upheld pertains to the possession of official documents on his personal device, for which the lower court had sentenced him to three years in prison.As Agarwal has already served this term during his detention, he is now eligible for immediate release.This ruling effectively ends the legal battle for Agarwal in the high-profile case that had attracted widespread attention due to the sensitive nature of the alleged breach involving defense secrets.Arrested in October 2018 through a joint operation by Military Intelligence (MI) and the Anti-Terrorism Squad (ATS) of Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra, Agrawal was employed in the technical research section of BAPL, an Indo-Russian joint venture that manufactures BrahMos missiles.Investigations revealed that crucial documents related to the BrahMos missile were found on his personal computers, violating BAPL’s security norms.The chats showed that 'Sejal' was part of a group that shared data and tips on deceiving Indian defence staffers. Awasthi told the court that on Sejal's directions, Agrawal had clicked on links sent by her and installed three apps on his personal laptop in 2017.These apps were: Qwhisper, Chat to Hire and X-trust.These three apps were actually malware that stole data from Nishant's laptop, which contained classified information. Investigations claim that crucial documents related to the BrahMos missile were found on his personal computers, violating BAPL’s security norms.Nishant is said to have chatted with Sejal on LinkedIn as well, where she reportedly showed interest in hiring him, posing as a recruiter in UK's Hays Aviation.","Nishant agarwal, a scientist at brahmos aerospace limited, was arrested in 2018 for allegedly passing sensitive defense secrets to pakistan intelligence operatives.

Sponsor responds as community questions why Zentreya became the target of a viral controversy

""I'm on no political side. I don't agree with N

zis!""

“Why are people so quick to want to hurt and try to take down others? Come on.

Do better. Be kinder.”





Popular VTuber Zentreya's recent introduction of the “General Zentreya” model was met with a series of backlash and hatred on social media. Within hours of its reveal on November 27, 2025, the internet turned it into a controversy that she never intended in the first place. While some fans praised the updated aesthetic, haters were quick to point out the model’s military-inspired outfit of echoing extremist behaviour and intentions.The widespread criticism spread quickly when X user @daitan_kodi claimed that the design carried a “N*zi vibe,” owing to its colour palette and certain stylistic choices. The discourse turned toxic, which forced Zentreya to defend both her intentions and her community. Zentreya was quick to reject any connections to N*zism or any negative connotations with her outfit of choice.Zentreya addressed the haters head-on during a livestream, firmly rejecting any association of any kind with extremist ideology. She stated,zism… F**k N*Additionally, she issued a follow-up statement explaining her defensive stance, saying, ""I think not wanting to be labeled a N*zi immediately out of the gate would get anyone heated.""The conversation took another intense turn with Tim Zheng, the founder of Vite Kitchens and Vite Ramen and a longtime sponsor, spoke against the accusers. Zheng said the situation “smells like trying to take someone else down because it makes them feel better, makes them feel bigger.”He further called the controversy infuriating and felt that it was born more from needless nitpicking to create drama rather than sincere concerns. Calling the negative reaction “clout chasing,” Zheng questioned why creators like Zentreya become easy targets for such criticism, saying,Meanwhile, Zentreya herself seemed fed up with the whole situation, posting on November 30, “This is so stupid.” The fact that her simple, well-intentioned act and outfit were turned into such a bizarre and out-of-touch controversy is shocking and exposes haters who will do or say anything to get clicks and put others down.Also read: “My heart aches…” VTuber Apricot speaks amid VShojo drama as fan urges “not too late to leave dawg” to the last standing member","Vtuber zentreya's recent introduction of the “general zent reya” model was met with a series of backlash and hatred on social media.

Majlak calls the claim “categorically untrue” as tensions rise online





Mike Majlak has spoken up to stop a big rumor that spread fast after SteveWillDoIt appeared on Logan Paul ’s Impaulsive podcast. The rumor said that Mike Majlak gave SteveWillDoIt alcohol during the taping, which many people believed was the reason the show went out of control. The episode became very messy online, and fans on both sides shared many posts about it. Because the talk kept growing, Mike Majlak decided to show the real truth.On Instagram, he posted a behind-the-scenes video from the Impaulsive set. In the clip, SteveWillDoIt can be seen asking for a cigarette or tequila during the interview. Logan Paul quickly told him that smoking was not allowed. Right after this, Parker, who is SteveWillDoIt’s manager, walked up with a bottle of tequila. This made it clear that Mike Majlak did not give Steve alcohol, and that the rumor was wrong.After sharing the video, Mike Majlak also posted a screenshot of an Instagram user who accused him of using SteveWillDoIt’s drinking problem for views. Mike wrote in his caption that the rumor was “categorically untrue.” He said he was open to talking about the episode and how things could be better next time, but he needed to fix the false story because he had received many messages about it.The rumor grew stronger after SteveWillDoIt posted Instagram Stories calling Mike Majlak the “biggest loser ever,” and also calling him fake and a bad person. This pushed more people to believe that Mike gave him alcohol on the set.All of this started last month when SteveWillDoIt, whose real name is Stephen Deleonardis, was asked to leave the Impaulsive studio. Many of his words were censored, but Logan Paul told him he had crossed the line and needed to calm down. When Steve kept talking, Mike Majlak said they should end the show and thanked him.Later, Logan Paul said on the show that he was shocked no one had hit Steve and that he would have slapped him if they were not filming. Per PopRant, SteveWillDoIt was on the show to say that his YouTube ban from 2022, given for promoting gambling websites, had been lifted.Also Read: Candace Owens And Charlie Kirk Controversy Explained: Inside Her Statements On Erika Kirk, Emmanuel Macron And Mystery Around His Death",Mike majlak fights rumor with strong clip as stevewilldoit is seen taking tequila from manager during impaulsive podcast.majlak calls the claim “categorically untrue” as tensions rise online online.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125698168,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-882603,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff has declared that he will not use ChatGPT, the AI chatbot developed by Microsoft-backed AI company OpenAI . His comments came after he used Google’s latest AI model, Gemini 3.0, stating that a two-hour experience with Google’s new model has convinced him to switch permanently. Google CEO Sundar Pichai termed the Gemini 3 as the company’s “most intelligent model, that combines all of Gemini’s capabilities together so you can bring any idea to life. ”In a post on X, Benioff claimed that Gemini 3.0 has brought a monumental shift in the AI landscape. The CEO specifically praised Gemini 3’s performance across multiple modalities, noting key improvements in reasoning, speed, image quality, and video processing as the compelling factors behind his decision.“Holy shit. I’ve used ChatGPT every day for 3 years. Just spent 2 hours on Gemini 3. I’m not going back. The leap is insane — reasoning, speed, images, video… everything is sharper and faster. It feels like the world just changed, again. ❤️ 🤖”Benioff’s endorsement highlights the competitive pressure now facing OpenAI as models from rival tech giants like Google make significant advances. Tesla CEO Elon Musk and even OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman praised Pichai following the launch of Gemini 3.The xAI founder said “Congrats” on Pichai’s ""Geminiii"" announcement on X, and “Nice Work” to Demis Hassabis, the chief of DeepMind. Altman posted “Congrats to Google on Gemini 3! Looks like a great model.”Altman even noted potential “temporary economic headwinds” in an internal memo but expressed confidence in OpenAl’s rapid progress and leadership in the Al race.“We have built enough strength as a company to weather great models shipping elsewhere competition... (so), having most of our research team focused on really getting to superintelligence is critically important,” Altman wrote in the internal memo sent to employees.Stripe CEO Patrick Collison also posted on X that Gemini 3 built him an “interactive web page summarising 10 breakthroughs in genetics,” and called it “pretty cool.”Nvidia also responded to Google's stock rally, with a company stating 'We're delighted by Google's success—they've made great advances in AI, and we continue to supply them.' However, this diplomatic response came amid reports that Google's AI chips (TPUs) could potentially challenge Nvidia's market dominance, particularly after news emerged that Meta was in talks to purchase billions of dollars worth of Google's tensor processing units. Despite Google's stock hitting all-time highs and rising over 120% since April, while Nvidia's shares dipped following the competitive news, Nvidia emphasised its leadership position, noting it remains 'a generation ahead of the industry.'","Salesforce ceo mark benioff has declared that he will not use chatgpt, the ai chatbot developed by microsoft-backed ai company openai.

What Is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

Disruption will come from the unexpected





Take lessons from the dot-com era









Billionaire investor and Shark Tank judge Mark Cuban has now issued a warning to leading artificial intelligence companies including Perplexity, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft and Meta. Cuban has argued that all these companies are overspending in the race to build the world’s most powerful AI model. As reported by Business Insider, speaking in the Pioneers of AI podcast, Cuban compared today’s AI arms race to the search engine boom of 1990s. The search engine boom ultimately ended with Google dominating the market and leaving all the rivals behind.“You’ve got five, six, whatever it is, companies that are trying to create the ultimate foundational model that we all depend on,” Cuban said. “It’s almost like in the ’90s when all the search engines were competing pre-Google… Now, we know with search engines it’s Google, and then there’s Bing, as, like, 1 or 2% and DuckDuckGo has got a half a percent. So it’s effectively a winner-take-all.”Like many other world leaders and analysts, Cuban has also cautioned that the massive investments done on AI could ultimately lead to the creation of a bubble. “They may be overspending,” he said.“And if they overspend or get too caught up, the bubble is in the competition between all those models because that could pop just like that with any new technology.”Along with this, he also raised concerns about the infrastructure costs behind AI, majorly the massive and expensive data centers which are being built to power large models. “I just can’t imagine over a 10-year period that we aren’t going to improve the technology enough that if you overspend on today’s technology, it just doesn’t feel right to me,” Cuban added.Cuban also emphasised that the disruption AI will not come from incremental improvements but from something “incredible” that no one sees coming. “Somebody’s going to come up with some incredible shit, right? If I knew what it was, I’d do it,” he said, suggesting that the current race may be blindsided by a breakthrough outside the existing competition.Cuban said he recognizes the same mix of hype, excitement, and overspending now playing out in AI. “They anticipate for at least another decade spending every penny they have,” he said of the major model developers. “I mean, if that’s not ripe for disruption to come up with better ways, I don’t know what is.”","Billionaire investor and shark tank judge mark cuban has issued a warning to leading artificial intelligence companies including perplexity, openai, anthropic, google, microsoft and meta.

In recent years, tech leaders have accelerated their race to build the most powerful AI first. “Sink or swim,” “AI is not going anywhere,” and “work with it or be replaced” have become mantras in workspaces at Amazon and beyond.

We, the undersigned Amazon employees, have serious concerns about this aggressive rollout during the global rise of authoritarianism and our most important years to reverse the climate crisis.

We believe that the all-costs-justified, warp-speed approach to AI development will do staggering damage to democracy, to our jobs, and to the earth.

We’re the workers who develop, train, and use AI, so we have a responsibility to intervene. Here’s why we’re sounding the alarm:

Amazon is casting aside its climate goals to build AI. We have just a few years to stop disastrous levels of warming. Yet despite committing to net zero carbon emissions by 2040, Amazon’s annual emissions have grown roughly 35% since 2019.

The AI race is widening this gap. The company plans to spend $150 billion building new data centers for AI. Many of these will be in drought-stressed regions, where they will consume scarce water, or in locations where their energy demands will force utility companies to keep coal plants online or build new gas plants.

Amazon even killed legislation that would have required its data centers to use clean energy. Meanwhile, AWS is helping oil companies drill for more oil and gas.

Amazon is forcing us to use AI while investing in a future where it’s easier to discard us. Andy Jassy promised that soon Amazon will be full of AI tools and “agents,” and that he expects to employ fewer humans. He claims our (remaining) jobs will be “even more exciting and fun,” but here’s what we’re actually experiencing: higher expected output and shorter timelines, mandates to build AI tools for wasteful use cases, and massive investment in AI with little investment in career advancement.

Our logistics coworkers have been especially impacted by work speedups, surveillance, injuries and burnout. All this, while Amazon is attempting to declare the National Labor Relations Board, which protects workers’ rights, unconstitutional.

Amazon is helping build a more militarized surveillance state with fewer protections for ordinary people. Amazon, alongside Meta, Microsoft and Google lobbied to ban state regulation on AI for the next ten years; Trump financially disincentivized state regulatory action in his AI Action Plan. Trump demanded an end to “wokeness” in AI; Amazon has scaled back its commitments to DEI and offered the administration a 1 billion dollar coupon for AWS, with a DOGE staffer calling the deal “a foundational piece to help implement President Trump’s AI Action Plan.” The military wants AI technologies at top speed; Amazon has announced a collaboration with an autonomous weapons software company. Trump’s ICE Director wants to run mass deportation “like Prime, but with human beings”; Amazon, a major provider of cloud services to DHS and to Palantir, literally does power mass deportation. Amazon is expanding the surveillance state in other ways, too. It’s making Ring AI-first and re-introducing a tool for police to request footage; it’s using AI to surveil warehouse workers, and, of course, its own customers. Finally,

Jeff Bezos

owns The Washington Post, and has begun asserting more control over that publication; the other major AI players control mass information ecosystems like Instagram and X. If these collaborations continue, we will be ceding an unbelievable amount of power into the hands of an increasingly authoritarian government and a few companies willing to abandon any principles they claim to have in the race for AI dominance.

All of this is daunting, but none of it is inevitable. A better future is still very much within reach, but it requires us to get real about the costs of AI and the guardrails we need.

We demand Amazon leadership commit to the following:

No AI with dirty energy.

No more vague promises that “AI will solve the climate crisis.” Amazon must implement a public plan that includes: 1) powering all data centers with 100% additional, local renewable energy, 24/7, 2) ending custom AI solutions for oil & gas companies to drill more oil faster, and 3) publishing a detailed, science-backed glidepath for how it will meet its climate commitments.

No AI without employee voices.

We want ethical AI working groups of non-managers across the company that will have significant ownership over org-level goals and how or if AI should be used in their orgs, how or if AI-related layoffs or headcount freezes are implemented, and how to mitigate or minimize the collateral effects of AI use, such as environmental impact.

No AI for violence, surveillance, or mass deportation.

Amazon sells a huge range of products and services — from physical goods to digital infrastructure to films to medical services. It should not need to be helping surveil civilians in Gaza, collaborating with AI companies that specialize in drone warfare, or supporting a mass deportation machine.

The Amazon employees signing this letter believe in building a better world — not in building bunkers to fall back to. We want the promised gains from AI to give everyone more freedom to play and rest, to spend time with family and friends, to be moved by nature, to create, to feel safe being who we are.

This is an incredibly consequential moment in history. It’s time for us to step up and spark a conversation about the real benefits and costs of AI. Workers have guided Amazon to a better path before, and we can do it again. The choices we make now, for the planet, for its people and animals, matter more than ever. Let’s make ones we can be proud of.

Signed,

1,039 Amazon employees (and counting!)





Thousands of Amazon employees have signed an open letter issuing some dire warnings about the company’s move toward AI. The letter, signed by more than 1,000 workers (and counting) calls out Amazon for pushing its AI investments at the expense of the climate and its human workforce. The letter’s supporters come from a wide array of roles at the company, including many software engineers, and even employees focused on building AI systems. ""We believe that the all-costs-justified, warp-speed approach to AI development will do staggering damage to democracy, to our jobs, and to the earth,” the letter’s authors wrote. It adds, “We’re the workers who develop, train, and use AI, so we have a responsibility to intervene.”The open letter is reportedly signed by Amazon workers anonymously, and comes almost a month after Amazon announced mass layoff plans as it increases adoption of AI in its operations. Among the signatories are employees in a range of positions, including engineers, product managers and warehouse associates. The letter argues that their employer is throwing out its climate promises in the scramble to win the AI race.Amazon has pledged to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, pointing to efficiencies from electric delivery vehicles and reduced plastic packaging in its climate commitment.","Over 1,000 amazon employees have penned an open letter expressing grave concerns about the company's rapid ai development.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has revealed his annual holiday reading list as the 2025 comes to a close. Gates has recommended five books and he believes that all these titles spark curiosity and reflection during the quieter days of the winter season. “Each of these books pulls back the curtain on how something important really works: how people find purpose later in life, how we should think about climate change, how creative industries evolve, how humans communicate,” wrote Gates.In the blog post, Gates has also explained that holidays are the perfect tome to slow down and also catch up on reading. “There’s something about the quieter days around the holidays that makes it easier to sit down with a good book,” he wrote. His list on 2025 book recommendations reflects on his fascination with how the world works and how you can start a great conversation.The book belongs to the fiction genre and its a story of an aging janitor and a wise octopus captive hime with its empathy and storytelling. “Van Pelt's story made me think about the challenge of filling the days after you stop working—and what communities can do to help older people find purpose,” said Gates.The books explains about the climate challenges. The book structures 50 big questions on climate change, nuclear power and renewables. “ I’ve followed Hannah’s work at Our World in Data for years, and her new book is one of the clearest explanations of the climate challenge I’ve read. She’s realistic about the risks but grounded in data that shows real progress,” said Gates.It is a memoir which recounts the Diller’s extraordinary career in Hollywood, media, and technology, blending personal anecdotes with reflections on power, risk-taking, and the evolution of entertainment and digital industries. “He’s spent his life betting on ideas before they were obvious, and the industries he’s transformed show how much those bets can pay off,” said Gates.The book explains about the mysteries of human behaviour and how people communicate. “Although the topic itself is pretty complicated, the book is readable and practical, and it made me see everyday social interactions in a new light,” added Gate.The books offers a glimpse of at why America seems to struggle to build things and what it will take to fix that. The book argues that progress depends not just on good ideas but on the systems that help ideas spread.",Microsoft co-founder bill gates has revealed his annual holiday reading list as the 2025 comes to a close.

GTA VI details from the leaked footage



GTA VI makers fires employees for leaking game data







GTA VI, Grand Theft Auto 6, in-development gameplay footage has reportedly been leaked online by a former Rockstar Games employee. The short demo reel suggests potential hints about new gameplay features and provides purported details regarding the game’s main characters ahead of its November 2026 launch. The franchise’s official trailer revealed in December 2023 broke global records, and the latest leaked footage has intensified the excitement surrounding the game.According to multiple reports online, including one from Game Rant, the leaked footage was included as part of an unnamed former employee’s demo reel. It primarily focused on showcasing new player animations, which includes bicycle rentals and truck bed riding.One clip shows a generic player character interacting with what appears to be a bike rental station, demonstrating smooth animations for both mounting and dismounting a bicycle. The second animation features one of the game's confirmed protagonists, Lucia Caminos, hopping off the roof of a truck and onto the ground.The demo reel also contained animation samples from other Rockstar titles, including Red Dead Redemption 2, GTA 5, and Max Payne 3, essentially pointing towards its authenticity as internal development material.Last month, Rockstar Games, the studio behind the GTA series, terminated over 30 employees for sharing confidential company information in public forums. The gaming giant said that the employees violated company policy by “distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum.” A Rockstar spokesperson insisted the action “was in no way related to people's right to join a union or engage in union activities. ”Meanwhile, the developers have pushed back the GTA VI launch date from May 2026 to November 2026. The game is set in Vice City, and will feature dual protagonists, Lucia and Jason Duval. It has been rumoured that the version of Vice City map in GTA VI will have significantly deeper environments with far more interior spaces for players to explore.","A former rockstar games employee is believed to have leaked gameplay footage of grand theft auto 6.

How to clear Gmail storage and keep your inbox running smoothly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-tips/how-to-clear-gmail-storage-and-keep-your-inbox-running-smoothly/articleshow/125597081.cms,"Why does Gmail storage fill up faster than expected

How to clear Gmail storage quickly and effectively

Empty the Trash and Spam folders

Delete large emails and attachments

Remove newsletters and old promotional emails

Use the Google One Storage Manager to clear space across all services

Habits that prevent Gmail from filling up again

When you might need more storage

Running out of storage on Gmail can be stressful, especially when important emails start bouncing back or the service becomes slow. Many people do not realise how quickly storage fills up across connected Google services like Drive and Photos. Since Gmail shares its storage with the rest of the Google account, everything from attachments to uploaded files contributes to the limit. When the warning appears that storage is almost full, it can feel overwhelming. Fortunately, there are simple and practical steps that help clear space without spending money on upgrades. With a little organisation and a few smart habits, it is possible to reduce clutter and regain smooth performance in your inbox.Google provides an official Storage Manager that helps users see exactly what is taking up space across Gmail, Drive and Photos. The tool highlights large files, old emails with attachments and unnecessary items that can be deleted safely. It is the most reliable method since it works directly with data stored in the cloud rather than guessing what to remove.Gmail storage includes emails, sent items, drafts, attachments and everything stored in Google Drive and Google Photos. Even if the inbox does not appear full, large attachments or uploaded videos may be using most of the space.Promotional emails, newsletters, archived messages and old backups also count towards the total. Deleted items continue to occupy storage until they are permanently removed from Trash, which is why simply deleting emails does not always free space. When storage reaches its limit, Gmail stops receiving new mail and certain functions may not work correctly. Understanding what contributes to the total makes it easier to clean up effectively.When emails are deleted, they move to Trash and stay there for up to 30 days. They still count towards storage until the Trash is emptied. The same applies to the Spam folder. By opening each folder and selecting the option to permanently delete all items, users often free up space instantly.Attachments are usually the biggest contributors to storage use. Gmail provides search filters that help locate bulky messages. Searching for terms like has: attachment larger:10M displays emails with attachments larger than 10 megabytes. Once these are found, they can be deleted in bulk or downloaded elsewhere before deletion.Promotional categories often accumulate thousands of unread messages because newsletters, offers and automated campaigns pile up quickly without being noticed. These can be selected and removed together to clear storage space and improve inbox performance. If many emails come from the same sender, unsubscribing prevents future build-up and keeps incoming mail manageable by stopping unnecessary notifications permanently. Over time, this simple clean-up habit reduces digital clutter, improves focus and makes it easier to find important conversations without endless scrolling or searching.The Google One Storage Manager scans all the services linked to a Google account and lists files that consume the most space. It separates storage usage into sections such as large emails, deleted items, large files in Drive and backed-up photos or videos. This approach ensures that nothing is missed, especially when files outside Gmail are the primary cause of reduced space. Through a single interface, large items can be reviewed and removed safely without confusion.Regular maintenance avoids repeat storage problems. Clearing old attachments, emptying Trash frequently and reviewing large items every few months helps maintain free space. Avoiding the habit of emailing large files repeatedly can also help. Instead of attaching high-resolution photos and videos directly to emails, it is better to share links from Drive or alternative storage platforms. This allows senders to delete the original attachments without losing access to the files. Unsubscribing from mass mailing lists also helps maintain a clean inbox.For users dealing with intensive file exchange, such as designers, editors, photographers and students, the default free storage may not be enough. In such cases, upgrading to a paid Google One plan is a practical solution. Using two Google accounts is also an option, allowing heavier tasks to be separated from regular daily email.Clearing Gmail storage does not need to be complicated. With a structured approach and support from the official Google tools, anyone can free space quickly and enjoy uninterrupted messaging. Reducing unnecessary files keeps email performance fast, improves organisation and helps stay focused without clutter.A few minutes of clean up can restore full functionality and avoid the frustration of running out of space at the wrong moment. The best approach combines one-time clean-up with regular habits that prevent build-up in the future, keeping Gmail efficient and reliable.","Gmail storage fills up quickly, especially if large files are attached.

Gemini 3 boosts Google’s market value





Google To Invest $15 Billion On AI Hub In Visakhapatnam, CEO Sundar Pichai Speaks To PM Modi

Years of hard work





Google CEO Sundar Pichai on AI layoffs









Google recently launched its most-advanced AI model — Gemini 3.0. Announcing the launch of Gemini 3.0, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that it is ‘the best model in the world for multimodal understanding’. Now weeks after the intense work on Gemini 3.0, Google CEO Sundar Pichai has acknowledged that his engineers are overdue for a break. As reported by Business Insider, speaking on the Google AI” Release Notes podcast, Pichai said “I think some folks need some sleep,” adding that hopefully he and his teams “get a bit of rest” now that the milestone launch is behind them.The comment made by Pichai comes as Google is moving towards a $4 trillion market cap as the stock price of the company has surged by nearly 70% this year, including a 12% jump following Gemini 3’s debut on November 18. The Gemini 3.0 model has been widely praised for its reasoning, speed and multimodal capabilities. Recently, Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff also described the Gemini 3.0 model as an ‘insane’ leap forward. He also added that after using Gemini 3.0 for two hours he will not go back to ChatGPT.After the successful roll out of Gemini 3.0, Google has managed to reclaim its frontrunner position in the AI race. Pichai noted that years of hard work of the company is the sole reason behind this success.“In 2016, I wanted the whole company to be AI-first,” he said, pointing to milestones such as the creation of Google Brain in 2012, the acquisition of DeepMind in 2014, AlphaGo’s victory in Go, and the unveiling of Google’s own tensor processing units (TPUs), which were used to train Gemini.Pichai further talked about the Google’s strategy. Pichai explained that Google always worked towards a “full-stack” approach to innovation, improving everything from infrastructure to model training and test-time compute. He admitted that when generative AI first gained traction, Google was short on capacity and had to invest heavily to scale. “If you were on the outside, it would look like we were quiet, or we were behind, but we were putting all the building blocks in place, and then executing on top of it,” he said.Recently, Google CEO Sundar Pichai talked about AI layoffs. In a recent expansive interview with BBC, Sundar Pichai pushed back against concerns that AI could eventually lead to mass job cuts. Pichai said that the tech will eliminate some jobs but also “evolve and transition” others -- ramifications that mean ""people will need to adapt.""Pichai further added that AI may be gunning for his job, but he doesn’t seem too worried about it. AI is advancing so swiftly, he said, that over the next 12 months the tech will be able to perform “complex” tasks and act as an agent on a users' behalf. ""That’s where it gets really interesting,"" he said.",Google recently launched its most-advanced ai model — gemini 3.0.

Buying a new smartphone is exciting, but counterfeit devices are flooding the market. Fake phones may look identical to genuine ones but often come with poor build quality, security risks, and no warranty support.
