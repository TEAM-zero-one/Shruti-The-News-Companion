"EV targets not met, claims plea; SC seeks Centre's report",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ev-targets-not-met-claims-plea-sc-seeks-centres-report/articleshow/120533804.cms,"NEW DELHI: Supreme Court on Tuesday asked the central govt to file a status report on implementation of its policies to encourage electric vehicles (EVs) as a PIL petitioner alleged that though in 2012 Centre had targeted to have about 70 lakh EVs on road by 2020, their numbers are just 35 lakh in 2025.Appearing for an NGO, advocate Prashant Bhushan told a bench of Justices Surya Kant and N Kotiswar Singh that the promised infrastructure to encourage people to buy EVs has not been fulfilled, resulting in 26.6 crore fossil fuel-run vehicles on the road which cause pollution, increase in fuel import cost and harm to the environment aiding climate change. Though the bench asked attorney general R Venkataramani to file a status report on implementation of various EV policies, it believed these are issues which are determined by market forces coupled with people's trust and capacity to buy EVs.Justice Kant said the car manufacturing industry is one of the largest in India and is not only earning good revenue for the country but also engaging a huge workforce.""Moreover, the production of EVs in India would be dependent on demand and supply, though EVs are of late gaining acceptance among people,"" the bench said. Bhushan said except for small subsidies made available on purchase of EVs, govts have done nothing to build charging infrastructure.In 2012, the target to provide 2.27 lakh charging centres for EVs has woefully fallen short as only 27,000 charging stations have been set up. Why can't every parking lot have multiple charging centres for EVs, he asked.The bench asked the attorney general to place on record in four weeks the policy decisions taken by Union govt from time to time to promote EVs and augmentation of charging infrastructure to facilitate those who are using EVs.","In 2012, the target to provide 2.27 lakh charging centres for evs has woefully fallen short as only 27,000 charging stations have been set up.

With projects that earn him between $3-5 million each, his Hollywood portfolio now forms a major chunk of his net worth.His ability to balance action roles with comedic and family-friendly projects has made him one of the most versatile stars to come out of WWE.Beyond wrestling and acting, Cena’s portfolio includes endorsement deals with brands like Hefty, Experian, Honda, and Crocs.

India's Rs 17,000 crore production-linked incentive programme for IT hardware is beginning to yield results as several brands previously reliant on China establish partnerships with domestic contract manufacturers for laptop production in India.These collaborations come against the backdrop of escalating trade tensions between China and the US. Despite the Donald Trump administration's current exemption on IT hardware imports from China, companies are hastening their discussions for local manufacturing arrangements with Indian firms, driven by concerns over potential sector-specific tariffs anticipated in May.Indian manufacturers are enhancing their production capabilities whilst offering global brands advantages through reduced tariffs and incentive schemes. Additionally, they provide opportunities to participate in government contracts requiring 20-50% local content.Industry sources told ET that present manufacturing capacity in India could replace approximately 10-20% of total laptop imports, which reached $11 billion in FY2024. Current domestic laptop production stands at roughly $1 billion, as per industry statistics.The Production Linked Incentive (PLI) 2.0 for IT Hardware, introduced on May 29, 2023, features a Rs 17,000 crore budget allocation across six years.The programme offers approximately 5% incentive on net incremental sales of locally manufactured products. Manufacturers must increase component localisation annually to secure additional incentives.The government anticipates that PLI 2.0 will attract Rs 3,000 crore in investments, generate Rs 3.5 lakh crore in production value, and create 47,000 jobs nationwide.Asus recently launched an assembly line at VVDN Technologies' Manesar facility after six months of discussions regarding scalability and localisation. According to Gourab Basu, senior vice president at VVDN, who spoke to the financial daily, their current production line produces one laptop every 240 seconds.Also Read | Elon Musk’s Tesla eyes India to diversify its global supply chain; in talks with CG Semi, Micron ""Our commitment to India is very, very strong,"" Dinesh Sharma, vice president, commercial PC and smartphone system business group, ASUS, said. ""When you are trying to shift your production supply chain, cost efficiency is a matter of concern. And the more backward integrations we can get, the better"".Gurugram-based Syrma SGS has established an agreement with Taiwan-based MSI for laptop manufacturing in India , responding to stricter import regulations. As a participant in the IT hardware PLI, the contract manufacturer recognises the opportunity for Indian companies to benefit from the shift away from high-tariff nations such as China and Vietnam.""We in the industry should catch the bull by its horns and take this opportunity to develop the ecosystem of components base in India,"" said Jasbir Singh Gujral, managing director, Syrma SGS, noting that the organisation will consider capacity expansion to attract additional laptop brands for exports. Dixon Technologies has allocated over Rs 1,000 crore towards establishing a new manufacturing unit in Tamil Nadu for HP Inc laptop production. The facility, scheduled to commence operations in May, will initially produce two million laptops yearly. Additionally, Dixon has contracted with Lenovo and Asus for laptop production at this location, whilst already producing 25-30% of Acer's domestic requirements at their Noida facility.Government statistics indicate that as of December 2024, PLI has attracted Rs 520 crore in investments, achieved Rs 10,000 crore in production value, and created 3,900 employment opportunities.The programme has experienced limited participation, as international companies continue importing most of their Indian sales volume, benefiting from China's 4-5% manufacturing cost advantage prior to tariff implementation. Despite China's established cost-effective ecosystem, global companies are now actively developing a comparable infrastructure in India as an alternative manufacturing base.Also Read | Donald Trump tariffs push Chinese giants to bow to India’s terms India's laptop exports remain constrained due to stringent US product testing requirements. An executive pointed out that India lacks appropriate testing facilities, necessitating product shipments to Shanghai's nearest laboratory for US export certifications, resulting in additional expenses.Asus' Sharma indicated the company's consideration of encouraging their global component suppliers to establish Indian operations, expressing willingness to share these suppliers with VVDN to support their backward integration initiatives.VVDN reported ongoing manufacturing of various components and modules, including Wi-Fi antennas, camera modules, memory packaging, display assembly, mechanical inclusions, and additional items. The company intends to establish a printed circuit board manufacturing facility.","Manufacturing capacity in india could replace approximately 10-20% of total laptop imports.

The team included Perry, journalist Gayle King, Bezos’ fiancée Lauren Sánchez, former Nasa engineer Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, and producer Keri Flynn. The suborbital flight crossed the Kármán line and lasted around 10 minutes.""You're brave, you're bold… No limitations,"" Perry said ahead of the launch, adding she drew inspiration from astrophysics readings and her role as a mother. “Being a mother just makes you level up with that type of power,” she noted.While Blue Origin celebrated the flight as a historic milestone for women in space , the trip drew criticism online, with some pointing to the juxtaposition of extravagant space missions and tax avoidance claims. One viral post read, “We are literally just asking them to pay their fair share of taxes, which they don’t.”Others, however, defended Bezos.

Swiss pharmaceutical giant Roche announced Tuesday it will invest $50 billion in the United States over the next five years, amid escalating uncertainty caused by President Donald Trump 's trade policies The move follows a similar decision by rival Novartis, which recently committed to a $23 billion US investment, news agency AFP reported.The US market is critical to Roche, accounting for over half the revenue of its pharmaceutical division. The company’s latest investment will strengthen its US footprint with expansions in manufacturing, distribution, and research.Roche said the investment will create more than 12,000 new jobs, including around 6,500 in construction. Key sites in Kentucky, Indiana, New Jersey, Oregon, and California will be upgraded or expanded to support the company’s innovative medicines and diagnostics. A new R&D center focused on artificial intelligence will also be established in Massachusetts.“Today’s announced investments underscore our long-standing commitment to research, development, and manufacturing in the US,” said CEO Thomas Schinecker. “These $50 billion investments over five years will support the next era of innovation and benefit patients globally.”Roche currently employs over 25,000 people across 24 sites in eight US states.Once the new facilities are operational, the company expects to export more medicines from the US than it imports.The announcement comes as the US government launches national security investigations into pharmaceutical imports, alongside probes into semiconductors and chip-making equipment.

Which country faces what?

The United States has announced imposition of substantial new duties reaching up to 3,521 per cent on solar imports from four Southeast Asian nations, supporting domestic manufacturers whilst creating challenges for the nation's renewable energy development.The duties, announced on Monday, follow a year-long trade investigation that claims that solar manufacturers in Cambodia Malaysia and Thailand were receiving unfair government subsidies and selling products to the US below production costs, as quoted by Bloomberg.The investigation, initiated under former President Joe Biden, was requested by domestic solar manufacturers. Despite Biden's Inflation Reduction Act spurring investment in domestic solar panel production, manufacturers expressed concern about foreign competitors selling equipment at reduced prices.These duties will advantage domestic manufacturers but create difficulties for US renewable developers who have depended on affordable foreign supplies, adding uncertainty to a sector already affected by Washington's policy fluctuations.These charges will supplement existing widespread tariffs implemented by US President Donald Trump that have disrupted global supply chains and markets.The department's decision favours domestic manufacturing, which both Trump and Biden have supported; offering an advantage to firms like Hanwha Q Cells and First Solar Inc.""This is a decisive victory for American manufacturing,"" stated Tim Brightbill, co-chair of Wiley's international trade practice and lead counsel for the petitioning solar companies. The investigation confirms ""what we've long known: that Chinese-headquartered solar companies have been cheating the system, undercutting US companies and costing American workers their livelihoods,"" he added.Cambodia faces countrywide duties of 3,521 per cent after ceasing participation in the investigation. Meanwhile, Vietnamese companies face duties up to 395.9 per cent, Thailand 375.2 per cent, and Malaysia 34.4 per cent.Specific companies received varying rates: Jinko Solar faces 245 per cent for Vietnamese exports and 40 per cent for Malaysian exports, whilst Trina Solar faces 375 per cent for Thai exports and over 200 per cent for Vietnamese exports. JA Solar modules from Vietnam could receive approximately 120 per cent.These four countries supplied $12.9 billion worth of solar equipment to the US last year, representing 77% of total module imports, according to BloombergNEF.The duties' implementation depends on the US International Trade Commission's upcoming decision regarding harm to domestic producers.Following similar duties on Chinese imports approximately 12 years ago, Chinese manufacturers relocated to unaffected nations. This investigation began after an April petition from the American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee, representing companies including First Solar, Hanwha Q Cells and Mission Solar Energy LLC.",The united states has announced substantial new duties on solar imports from four southeast asian nations.

The return of Donald Trump to the White House is one of the key reasons behind the current state of these big firms. Reciprocal tariffs and unstable markets have impacted the performance of the global economy.The ‘magnificent seven’- which includes Apple, Meta, Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Tesla, and Alphabet (google parent), are the leading firms of the technology sector and firms have altogether seen a blow of 22 per cent, which is $3.8 trillion from its market value as of Sunday.“The mass confusion created by this constant news flow out of the White House is dizzying for the industry and investors and creating massive uncertainty and chaos for companies trying to plan their supply chain, inventory, and demand,” said Dan Ives, a tech analyst with Wedbush Securities.The current rollercoaster in the market stands in stark contrast to the expectations and optimism once showcased by the heads of these seven firms- Apple’s Tim Cook, Tesla’s Elon Musk, Google’s Sundar Pichai, Meta’s Mark Zuckerberg, and Amazon’s Jeff Bezos — who appeared in rare harmony as they stood by US President Donald Trump at his January inauguration.The support of these heads was not only symbolic- rather it was rooted in a calculated move that Trump’s comeback would ease the trade regulations, earlier set up by former President Joe Biden.Rather than reaping the expected benefits, big tech now finds itself struggling to protect its footing.The Trump administration’s hardline trade agenda — especially the sweeping reciprocal tariffs unveiled on April 2 — has disturbed global supply chains and overturned corporate planning. While a temporary suspension of the harshest tariffs and exemptions for Chinese electronics imports have offered momentary relief, President Trump has signaled that this grace period may be short-lived.Alongside the trade tensions, Trump’s administration is still going after big tech with antitrust cases that started under former President Biden. Meta is being sued for allegedly running an illegal monopoly in social media, and Alphabet is fighting efforts to break up its control over online search. Apple and Amazon are also still under investigation and facing lawsuits.Trumps' call to ban Nvidia from selling a key AI chip to China has resulted in a $5.5 billion charge tied to its unsold inventory of processors earmarked for Chinese markets.With the onset of the earnings season, the heads of these big techs will be under pressure as they navigate their way through the current turmoil- both economic and political. With political challenges and shaken market confidence, this earnings season could be one of the most important for Big Tech in recent years.Tesla will report first on Tuesday, after revealing a 13 per cent drop in car sales amid protests over Elon Musk’s involvement in the administration's cost-cutting efforts.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New york-based air company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol.
