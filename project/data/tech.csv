Apple plans to add AI Search in Safari browser; Senior VP Eddy Cue points to 3 Google rivals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-plans-to-add-ai-search-in-safari-browser-senior-vp-eddy-cue-points-to-3-google-rivals/articleshow/120993178.cms,"Apple in discussions with OpenAI, Perplexity and others

Apple is planning to add AI-powered search options in the Safari browser . According to a Bloomberg report, Apple’s senior vice president of services, Eddy Cue said during his testimony with the US Justice Department that the company is “actively looking at” reshaping Safari. During the testimony, he revealed that searches on Safari dipped for the first time last month.“That has never happened in 22 years,” he said, adding this is due to people using AI. Cue said he believes that AI tools like OpenAI , Perplexity AI and Anthropic’s Claude AI, will eventually replace search engines like Google Chrome, further adding that Apple will bring these options to Safari in the future.“We will add them to the list — they probably won’t be the default,” he said.Currently, Google is the default search engine on Apple’s Safari browser for which the company pays around $20 billion a year to keep. Analysts estimate this accounts for about 36% of the search advertising revenue Google earns through Safari.Cue said that Apple is in discussions with AI search providers like OpenAI, Perplexity and Anthropic to add their AI tools as an option to Safari.“Prior to AI, my feeling around this was, none of the others were valid choices,” he said. “I think today there is much greater potential because there are new entrants attacking the problem in a different way.”Apple currently integrates OpenAI’s ChatGPT into its Siri digital assistant and plans to add Google’s AI tool Gemini later this year. Cue said the company also considered other AI options, including Anthropic, Perplexity, China-based DeepSeek, and Grok from Elon Musk’s xAI.He added that the deal with OpenAI gives Apple the flexibility to bring in other AI providers to its operating system, including Apple’s own AI models.Google-parent company Alphabet’s shares dipped about 8% on Wednesday (May 7), wiping out $160 billion from the company’s market capitalisation following Eddy Cue’s testimony.","Apple in discussions with openai, perplexity and others to add their ai tools as an option to safari.

Jensen Huang's warning to US leaders: ‘Get American AI out in front’ or risk losing China AI market,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/jensen-huangs-warning-to-us-leaders-get-american-ai-out-in-front-or-risk-losing-china-ai-market/articleshow/120992439.cms,"Jensen Huang's warning to US leaders

Nvidia targets $50 billion in China's AI boom – why it can't afford to miss out

Impact of US export restrictions on Nvidia

Broader economic implications for the US

China’s rapid AI advancements and competitive threats

Financial performance and market outlook

The path forward: Balancing growth and national security

“The world is right now hungry, anxious to engage AI,”

“Let us get the American AI out in front of everybody right now.”

Nvidia , the world’s leading producer of graphics processing units (GPUs) and a dominant force in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry, is facing a critical challenge as US-China trade tensions continue to escalate. CEO Jensen Huang recently emphasized the significance of the Chinese AI market , which he estimates could reach $50 billion in the next two to three years.Speaking at ServiceNow’s Knowledge 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Huang described the potential loss of access to this market as ahighlighting the broader economic impact on US jobs, revenue, and technological leadership. This concern comes amid tighter US export restrictions that have significantly affected Nvidia’s business prospects in China, one of its largest international markets.China has long been a vital market for Nvidia, not only as a major consumer of its advanced AI chips but also as a hub for cutting-edge AI research and development. Nvidia’s GPUs, known for their unmatched parallel processing capabilities, are essential for training and deploying sophisticated AI models, making them indispensable for industries ranging from autonomous vehicles to cloud computing.Huang noted in his interview that China’s AI market could grow to $50 billion within the next two to three years, presenting a massive revenue opportunity. Given that Nvidia’s GPUs have become the backbone of the global AI industry, securing a share of this rapidly expanding market is critical for the company’s long-term growth.However, Nvidia’s ability to access this lucrative market has been increasingly constrained by US export controls aimed at limiting China’s technological advancements. Last month, the Trump administration further tightened these restrictions, requiring special licenses for Nvidia to ship its H20 chips to China. These chips, part of the Hopper architecture, were specifically designed to comply with earlier export regulations but are now caught in the latest wave of trade restrictions.As a result, Nvidia announced a staggering $5.5 billion quarterly charge, reflecting the financial blow of losing a critical revenue stream. This move marks one of the most significant financial impacts on the company since it became a trillion-dollar tech giant, raising concerns about the sustainability of its rapid growth.Huang highlighted the broader economic consequences of these export restrictions, emphasizing the potential loss of US jobs and tax revenue. During the interview, he argued that maintaining access to the Chinese market is not just about Nvidia’s bottom line but also about the long-term competitiveness of the US tech sector.“We just have to stay agile,” Huang said, stressing the importance of balancing national security concerns with the need for economic growth and technological leadership. He added that the ongoing restrictions could force Chinese companies to develop domestic alternatives, potentially reducing US influence in the global AI industry over the long term.Huang’s comments come amid growing concerns about China’s rapid progress in AI technology. At a separate tech conference in Washington, D.C., in April, Huang warned that China is “not behind” in AI and described Huawei as “one of the most formidable technology companies in the world.”This assessment aligns with recent reports indicating that Chinese firms like Huawei and DeepSeek have made significant strides in developing their own AI chips, potentially challenging Nvidia’s dominance in this critical sector. Huang’s remarks underscore the competitive pressure Nvidia faces as it navigates a complex geopolitical landscape.Despite these challenges, Nvidia remains a dominant force in the global AI market. The company’s market capitalization has approached $3 trillion, making it one of the most valuable tech companies in the world. However, its stock has experienced significant volatility in recent months, with shares down about 15% so far this year after nearly tripling in 2023.Nvidia is set to report its next quarterly earnings on May 28, with analysts expecting a 65% year-over-year revenue increase to $43.1 billion, according to data from LSEG. This projected growth reflects the ongoing demand for AI hardware, even as the company grapples with geopolitical uncertainties and supply chain challenges.Huang’s recent comments highlight the delicate balance Nvidia must strike as it seeks to maintain its leadership in the AI industry while navigating complex geopolitical challenges. As US policymakers weigh the risks and benefits of restricting high-tech exports to China, companies like Nvidia face tough decisions about how to adapt to an increasingly fragmented global market.Huang said during his Las Vegas appearance.With AI becoming a critical driver of economic growth and technological innovation, the stakes for Nvidia and the broader US tech sector have never been higher.","Jensen huang recently emphasized the significance of the chinese ai market, which he estimates could reach $50 billion in the next two to three years.

PwC layoffs: Impacted employees

Here’s what PwC said on the job cuts

Deloitte, KPMG among other Big Fours announcing job cuts

PwC, one of the Big Four accounting firms , has laid off nearly 1,500 employees in the US. According to a Financial Times report, the job cuts affect 2% of PwC’s 75,000 employees in the US. Quoting people familiar with the matter, the report states that most of the impacted staff worked in the audit and tax departments. The job cuts followed a months-long review of the business.Earlier, PwC had shifted hundreds of U.S. employees from less busy roles to faster-growing areas.Affected employees were notified on Monday and Tuesday this week. Hundreds of them received a Microsoft Teams meeting invite marked “time sensitive” in their email, the publication added.Many of the employees laid off had only recently joined PwC. One person who started in September told FT that they were ""devastated."" “Everyone was completely blindsided by the lay-offs today,” the person said.Another employee added, “Some of us were up for promotion, but instead of a promotion and a pay bump we’re now getting cut off.”The firm is also reducing campus hiring because of lower staff turnover but will honor the offers already made to last year’s interns who are scheduled to join later this year, the person said.“This was a difficult decision, and we made it with care, thoughtfulness and a deep awareness of its impact on our people, appreciating that historically low levels of attrition over consecutive years have made it necessary to take this step,” reads a statement from the company.Other Big Four firms have also announced similar job cuts. Earlier this year, Deloitte informed its employees that the group is laying off staff across its advisory business. In an internal call then, the firm said “Overall demand for Deloitte’s services remains strong”.“We are taking modest personnel actions based on moderating growth in certain areas, our government clients’ evolving needs, and low levels of voluntary attrition.”KPMG also laid off around 330 employees in the U.S. in November 2024. The firm then said it was “addressing continued low levels of attrition”.","Pwc, one of the big four accounting firms, has laid off nearly 1,500 employees in the us.

Bangladesh Currency Crisis: Bangladesh faces currency crisis as central bank halts issuing notes featuring Mujibur Rahman,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladesh-faces-currency-crisis-as-central-bank-halts-issuing-notes-featuring-mujibur-rahman/articleshow/120714882.cms,"Approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused

DHAKA: The central bank of Bangladesh has apparently incurred a huge financial loss due to the interim govt’s decision not to issue previously printed notes, with approximately Taka 15,000 crore worth of paper notes featuring the image of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman remaining unused. The decision aligns with govt’s efforts to diminish Bangabandhu’s presence in public memory.Although bank officials are unwilling to discuss the matter publicly, many, on conditions of anonymity, said the longstanding tradition of obtaining new notes from Bangladesh Bank has been abruptly halted, creating a crisis in the market. On the one hand, the printed money is being wasted without use; on the other hand, customers are suffering as a result, they added.“Notes of various denominations are printed using paper and ink purchased with people’s taxes. Millions of notes with Bangabandhu’s picture are still lying in the vaults of various banks. The Security Printing Corporation does not have the capacity to cancel all the notes at once and print new ones. Therefore, notes with Bangabandhu’s picture cann’t be suddenly cancelled,” Ziauddin Ahmed, former executive director of Bangladesh Bank and former managing director of Security Printing Corporation, told reporters.In this situation, he suggested the printed notes be circulated in the market to alleviate public suffering. “When new design notes come into the market, the old ones should be gradually withdrawn. Generally, notes printed once can be used for a maximum of four to five years,” Ahmed said.According to media reports, Bangladesh Bank is unable to issue new notes to banks in line with demand. The crisis became evident following the country’s political upheaval in Aug last year.Since all forms of currency, including metal coins, feature Mujibur’s image, Bangladesh Bank abruptly stopped issuing new notes early April. As a result, the notes featuring Bangabandhu’s image are not reaching the market. Shops, banks, and citizens are now left with torn and old, dirty notes.According to sources at Bangladesh Bank, the Security Printing Corporation is set to begin printing new design notes next month. In the first phase, new design notes of 20, 50, and 1,000 taka will be printed and subsequently released in the market through banks.","Approximately taka 15,000 crore worth of notes remain unused.

BENGALURU: Netherlands-based global tech investor Prosus invested over $8.6 billion in India, making it one of its strategic markets, CEO Fabricio Bloisi said in a letter to shareholders on Thursday. The update follows Swiggy's IPO last year and a recent investment in the ride-hailing platform Rapido, which Bloisi said is growing over 100% year-on-year and facilitating more than 3 million rides per day.""India presents Prosus with incredible opportunity,"" Bloisi wrote, noting the region's role in the group's ambition to build the leading lifestyle e-commerce ecosystem across India, Europe, and Latin America.Prosus' e-commerce segment outperformed internal expectations in the financial year ended March, with adjusted EBIT (aEBIT) surpassing $435 million - above the $400 million target set earlier. The company is now aiming to deliver a similar level of incremental profitability in FY26.Key portfolio companies delivered strong results. OLX, one of the largest classifieds businesses globally, grew revenue by nearly 20% and expanded aEBIT by over 50% to $270 million.iFood processed more than 120 million orders in a month and grew its aEBIT to over $200 million, more than double the previous year. Its subscription service, Clube, is now contributing around 40 million monthly orders, with increased user frequency and retention.Prosus also emphasised capital discipline, noting over $35 billion returned to shareholders through its ongoing buyback programme. This has reduced the free float of Prosus by 27% and Naspers by 25%. Portfolio pruning yielded $2.4 billion, driven by stake sales in Swiggy, Trip, Tazz, and the Latin America and Africa payments business. Bloisi said the company will now focus on integrating two recent acquisitions - Just Eat Takeaway in Europe and Despegar in Latin America - over initiating new investments. AI-driven innovation remains a priority, with Prosus Ventures backing firms such as Corti, Zapia, Altera, and Taktile. ""We are just getting started,"" Bloisi wrote, completing his first fiscal year as CEO.","Prosus invested over $8.6 billion in india, making it one of its strategic markets.

Startups Revolutionizing Carbon Dioxide into Valuable Products,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/startups/global/startups-revolutionizing-carbon-dioxide-into-valuable-products/articleshow/106920179.cms,"For most perfume makers, ingredients to make it smell great are the most important feature. But for Stafford Sheehan, a cofounder and chemist at Air Company, the most important part of perfume-making has no scent at all.New York-based Air Company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol, which is then blended with essential oils and water to produce perfume. While the pale yellow-color Air Eau de Parfum is about 50% more expensive than Coco Chanel’s signature No. 5, Sheehan says his product is uniquely valuable: Every 50-milliliter bottle uses 3.6 grams of CO2 that otherwise would have been released into the atmosphere. Its package reads: “Turning CO2 into something beautiful.”While the volume of CO2 utilized in the bottle is extremely small, Air Company’s perfume showcases one way the coming wave of captured carbon can be put to use. Renewable energy and electric cars alone won’t be enough to cut CO2 emissions to zero. The world will almost certainly need to capture billions of tons of the gas annually in the coming decades. Large amounts will likely be stored underground. Using it — so-called carbon capture and utilization, or CCU — to create new products from perfume to jet fuel could be an important tool in the fight against climate change , too, though the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.Roughly 230 million tons of CO2 are utilized every year, according to a 2019 report by the International Energy Agency. While roughly one-third of that is reused to force more oil from the ground — hardly a carbon-neutral process — CCU advocates say that the number of companies coming up with new uses for carbon has mushroomed in recent years, paving a way to unlock climate benefits. Carbon-derived fuels and chemicals, for example, could theoretically grow to the scale of billions of tons of CO2 use per year if companies could perfect their technology and lower costs.Calgary-based CleanO2 transforms CO2 captured from building heating boilers into feedstock to make soap. Newlight Technologies, a biotechnology startup based in California, takes carbon pulled directly from the air and turns it into biodegradable plastics. Germany’s Covestro AG, one of the world’s largest polymer manufacturers, is also switching some of its fossil fuel-based feedstocks to carbon-derived materials for everything ranging from car shells to medical devices and stadium roofs.Most companies working on CO2-sequestering products are still in their infancy. To grow the emerging sector, global venture capitalists in 2022 poured nearly $500 million into carbon utilization businesses, according to the IEA. That’s in stark contrast to 2015, when barely any venture money went to technologies that utilize CO2.“It’s just a whole different landscape today than it was a decade ago,” says Sasha Mackler, executive director of the energy program at Washington, DC-based non-profit Bipartisan Policy Center.Jennifer Holmgren, chief executive officer of LanzaTech Global Inc., has experienced the shifting sentiment firsthand. The Illinois-based company uses a carbon-eating bacteria – discovered in the guts of rabbits and preserved as powder – to make alternative ethanol in bioreactors not dissimilar to how breweries ferment beer. In the early 2010s, when Holmgren touted carbon-derived ethanol to prospective customers, her sales pitch was met with skepticism.But the tide began turning later that decade. In 2018, the company’s jet fuel produced from the emissions of a Chinese steel mill helped power a Transatlantic flight. LanzaTech has also inked agreements with airlines including Japan’s All Nippon Airways to supply CO2-derived jet fuel. And LanzaJet, the company’s spin-off, plans to start producing sustainable jet fuels at a commercial scale this year.Yet for all the hype around sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) using captured carbon, the industry is still an extremely small player. Almost every major airline in the world has pledged to use at least 10% sustainable jet fuels by 2030, yet SAF makes up only 0.1% of global aviation fuel supply — and much of it is made from sources other than captured CO2, such as used cooking oil.“There’s a lot more interest because consumers have become much more interested in buying things that are lower carbon,” says Holmgren. That’s enabled LanzaTech to expand the number of products that utilize CO2.American plastic container maker Plastipak, for instance, has partnered with LanzaTech to produce carbon-derived packaging materials, while polyester converted from LanzaTech’s ethanol has replaced its petroleum-based counterpart at a pilot scale in Lululemon shorts, Zara dresses, H&M yoga pants, On running shoes and Craghoppers jackets. Like SAF, though, there’s still a long way to go for CO2-derived polyester to reach meaningful levels of use.Momentum to grow beyond one-off products and low-scale production has also been supercharged by a growing array of regulations and incentives around the world. For instance, the Inflation Reduction Act that US President Joe Biden signed in 2022 raised the tax credit for carbon capture and utilization by more than 70% to $60 per metric ton in an effort to make costly projects more financially appealing.To keep the climate within habitable limits, the IEA estimates that carbon capture will have to grow to 7.6 billion tons of CO2 annually by mid-century. CCU will play a role, though just how big remains to be seen. Not every use case is created equal and some approaches, such as dissolving compressed CO2 in water to make carbonated beverages, only store the gas temporarily. To quantify the true climate benefit of carbon utilization, experts say third-party verification is badly needed.The rise of CCU technology comes as another key approach in President Biden’s net-zero roadmap is hitting a bit of a wall. Carbon capture and storage — that is, gathering CO2 as it’s released from a coal-fired power plant or other emissions source and sequestering it underground — has faced challenges because carbon is often captured in one place and stored in another. That requires pipelines to transport the gas, which many local communities have opposed. Blackrock-backed Navigator, for example, recently announced it was scrapping a planned 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline.Carbon utilization companies say that they can sidestep that issue by using carbon near or at where it’s captured.At its 12-acre factory in Brooklyn, Glenwood Mason Supply demonstrates how. The concrete manufacturer takes CO2 captured at a residential building by its partner company, CarbonQuest, and uses a technique licensed from low-carbon concrete startup CarbonCure to convert the compressed carbon into a powder not unlike dry ice. It then injects it into industrial mixers. There, the CO2 meets cement, sand and aggregate, setting off a series of chemical reactions. The final result is concrete blocks with CO2 sealed in.The technique not only stores carbon but it can also make the blocks marginally stronger. The company estimates that it has utilized about 100 tons of CO2 in total since 2020. Even if the blocks break down, the stored carbon won’t be released as CO2 because it’s been mineralized.“Cement is a big offender in carbon emissions,” says Constance Cincotta, founder of the concrete factory. She became intrigued by the technology and its ability to lower her company's climate impact after hearing about it at an industry conference in the early 2010s. But it wasn't until CarbonCure came on the scene a few years ago that the prospect of CO2-storing cement became tangible. Glenwood Mason then sourced CO2 locally from CarbonQuest, which captures carbon from buildings in New York. Those factors have enabled large-scale production.While Cincotta’s intended to help the planet, she and her team discovered that sinking CO2 into concrete blocks is good for the business, too. In 2019, New York City — where the majority of the company’s concrete blocks are sold — passed a regulation requiring all buildings to shrink their carbon footprint 40% by the end of the decade. Glenwood Mason’s phones have been ringing ever since, with calls from architects and property developers who want to leverage their lower-carbon building materials to cut emissions, says Jeff Hansen, the company’s vice president in architectural sales and marketing.The factory’s CO2-storing concrete blocks also caught the eye of Amazon.com Inc, which in 2022 persuaded a real estate developer to purchase roughly 50,000 blocks for the construction of a new warehouse in New York that Amazon has leased. Had Glenwood Mason not sealed CO2 in its blocks, it wouldn’t have won the contract, Hansen says. To figure out how to pack more carbon into its products, the company has set up a laboratory in its factory to test the reaction between CO2 and other concrete feedstocks under different temperatures and humidity levels.But figuring out the right formula is only one consideration. Utilizing CO2 often comes with an additional cost. As the demand for CO2-derived products climbs, that green premium is expected to go down. Yet “it’s very hard to be a cost parity with a 100-year-old industry that doesn’t even have to pay for its externalities,” says Holmgren of LanzaTech. Even with economies of scale, Holmgren estimates that carbon-containing fabrics will still likely cost as much as 20% higher than conventional ones.“It’s unlikely that we will ever be a cost parity,” she says.In addition to the cost barrier, CCU companies also have to convince end users that may be suspicious of unproven new technologies.Changing feedstocks “does come with risks,” says Keith Wiggins, chief executive officer of Econic Technologies, a British startup that specializes in making carbon-derived chemicals. To get risk-averse industries onboard, Wiggins says his company is laser-focused on those that are under consumer pressure to change course.That strategy seems to be working. Econic has teamed up with three manufacturers in the US, China and India to produce mattresses, outdoor garments and building insulation materials that utilize CO2. The first batch of products using the company’s technology are scheduled to enter the market in 2024.For all the promise of the carbon utilization industry, it remains to be seen if it can challenge the status quo. While Air Company started selling carbon-derived perfume in 2021, the startup has yet to build its first commercial plant, Sheehan says, citing the time-consuming process needed for collecting data and fine-tuning the technology for large-scale production.Fow now, the company’s demonstration facility in New York City — where CO2 and hydrogen gas flow through tubes into a reactor to form chemical reactions, aided by catalysts made from a confidential mixture of metals — is designed to yield at least 10,000 gallons of CO2-derived liquid annually. The limited production capacity has left many orders for its perfume — as well as jet fuels and Air Vodka, another popular product made from CO2 — unfilled.“We need to scale these facilities to the size of oil refineries today in order to have the impact on climate change that we want to have,” Sheehan says.","New york-based air company uses technology that converts planet-warming carbon dioxide into ethanol. Carbon capture and utilization, or ccu, could be an important tool in the fight against climate change. But the nascent industry has major hurdles to overcome.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-106921271,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-633411,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
