HYDERABAD: It's not just the country's western border that took heavy enemy fire during Operation Sindoor . India was attacked in cyberspace, too, by state-backed hackers and hacktivists from Pakistan, Turkiye, Bangladesh, Malaysia, and Indonesia, with backing from China, according to cybersecurity experts.Apart from defence PSUs and their MSME vendors, critical infrastructure like ports, airports, power grids, transportation services like Indian Railways and airlines, telecom players like BSNL, fintech platforms like UPI, digital wallets, stock exchanges, and major Indian conglomerates with investments in infrastructure too came under attack, sources said. The attempt was to both embarrass India and also extract sensitive information about its defence systems, including its missiles, they said.According to Interpol trainer and cyber forensic expert Pendyala Krishna Shastry, the attacks were part of a broader campaign waged by Pakistani actors against Indian digital assets. These groups reportedly deployed malware, conducted phishing attacks, and launched denial-of-service operations targeting critical sectors such as finance, telecom, energy, and public services.Zone-H, a website that tracks defacements, reported incidents involving Indian govt domains. The website of National Institute of Water Sports (niws.nic.in) was claimed to have been defaced. Another, nationaltrust.nic.in, also experienced a breach, but was restored later.The Central Coalfields Ltd (CCL) website suffered a major technical glitch on Tuesday after a message appeared from one Mr Habib 404.

ISRO Deploys 10 Satellites To Assist Indian Military In Anti-Pakistan Mission; ‘At The Border…’

BENGALURU: Indian armed forces used a wide range of space assets - domestic and international commercial - to carry out Operation Sindoor , multiple sources have confirmed to TOI.“All of our strategic assets were put to use in different ways by our armed forces for Operation Sindoor. Our teams have been working round the clock and we are proud that Isro could help our forces in missions important for the country,” a senior official from Isro told TOI.Another official said that aside from domestic assets directly available with the armed forces (India has 9-11 military satellites ), Isro also facilitated “repeatable” data from a commercial global operator. “While data from our satellites from the Cartosat series and others were also used for planning, images were procured from Maxar ,” the senior official said.Maxar, the US-based satellite imagery provider supplies images to multiple governments and non-government entities across the world, while it remains unclear if Pakistan used its services for any of its operations during the current conflict. It is noteworthy that Pakistan also has access to the extensive military space assets of China.Indian armed forces also have access to other satellite data from Sentinel from Europe and another commercial operator from the US.“Indian satellites provide periodic data - with downloads of specific areas possible about once in 14 days. This data was made use of, while they used commercial data that’s available once a day too,” the official said.The Cartosat family of satellites, with high-resolution imagery and dual-use (image & video) capabilities, has been a key asset in India’s military intelligence toolkit. Launched for the first time in 2005, and progressively upgraded with satellites like the Cartosat-2C (for military), these satellites have provided crucial imagery for operations.Cartosat-2C, for example, delivers images with a resolution of 0.65 metres- an improvement over previous models- and has been vital in reconnaissance and surveillance operations. The high-resolution images from Cartosat can capture areas of interest (AOI) with incredible clarity, enabling commanders to make precise decisions based on intelligence from space. These were used for the 2016 Surgical Strike.Aside from Cartosat, the Risat family of satellites would have provided radar images useful to track movement, while the Gsat family of satellites were used for communications. “In all, a variety of Indian space assets have been useful and efforts are on to increase support to the armed forces in the years to come,” the official said. India’s NavIC combined with other global GPS systems also aided in operations.Indian Space Association (ISpA) director-general Lt Gen (retd) AK Bhat, said: “There would have been extensive use of space assets for imagery, sat-com (satellite communication) and PNT (positioning, navigation and timing). Space technology is an integral part of modern warfare.”Isro chairman V Narayanan, who said Sunday that 10 satellites are working round the clock for the armed forces, did not specifically comment on Operation Sindoor. He, however, told TOI: “We will be launching another important satellite on May 18, the EOS-09 or Risat-1B, which will add teeth to our armed forces.”“The satellite features an advanced C-band synthetic aperture radar system that delivers high-resolution Earth surface imagery in all weather conditions. This capability significantly enhances India’s surveillance capabilities,” he added. Unlike conventional optical satellites limited by cloud cover or darkness, Risat-1B’s radar technology penetrates these obstacles effectively.Earlier this month, Narayanan had said that India would launch 100-150 satellites in the next five years. Among these would be the 52 satellites part of the Space-Based Surveillance-3 (SBS-3) programme. Thirty-one of these will be developed by the private sector.",Indian armed forces used a wide range of space assets - domestic and international commercial - to carry out operation sindoor.

Nintendo balances pricing against adoption goals

Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa expressed concerns that the company may need to increase the price of the upcoming Switch 2 console in the United States due to recently implemented tariffs on Chinese imports. The revelation came during Nintendo's May 8 earnings call, just weeks before the console's scheduled June 5 launch.""If the assumptions regarding tariffs change significantly, we would like to consider what price adjustments we should make and implement them after considering various aspects,"" Furukawa stated, addressing the potential impact on the already premium-priced $449.99 console.Nintendo's forecast assumes tariffs of 10% on products from Japan, Vietnam, and Cambodia, while Chinese imports face a staggering 145% tariff (as of now, US and China are renegotiating the trade terms, which possibly could lower the tariff). The company expects these trade measures to impact profits by ""tens of billions of yen.""Furukawa highlighted broader economic concerns beyond direct manufacturing costs. ""If prices of daily necessities like food increase (because of the tariffs), then people will have less money to spend on game consoles. If we were to adjust the price of the Switch 2, this could decrease demand.""While Nintendo primarily manufactures Switch hardware for North America in Vietnam, certain accessories and amiibo figures come from China, subjecting them to higher tariff rates.Despite these challenges, Nintendo forecasts selling 15 million Switch 2 units in its first year – matching the original Switch's debut performance – though analysts describe this projection as ""conservative"" given the tariff uncertainties.The company faces a delicate balancing act between covering increased costs and maintaining consumer interest. ""Nintendo will carefully consider various factors when changing any pricing, including its acceptability to customers,"" Furukawa emphasized.The Switch 2 isn't alone in facing potential price hikes. Microsoft has already increased Xbox Series S prices by $80 and Series X by $100, while some smaller gaming hardware companies have suspended U.S. shipments entirely due to prohibitive tariff costs.Pre-orders for the Switch 2 opened on April 24 following a brief delay related to tariff concerns, with Nintendo warning that release-day delivery cannot be guaranteed due to overwhelming d","Nintendo president shuntaro furukawa expressed concerns that the company may need to increase the price of the upcoming switch 2 console.

If you haven’t been able to catch these shinies, now is the right time to try your luck.The Lake Guardians—Uxie, Mesprit, and Azelf—are some of the rarest Legendary Pokemon in Pokemon Go.

As a result, getting the shinies can also be tricky.Here’s everything you need to know about encountering Shiny Uxie, Shiny Mesprit , and Shiny Azelf in Pokemon GO, their stats, moves, weaknesses, and whether their Shiny forms are available.To get the shiny variants of the Lake Guardians, you will need to encounter them in the wild or in raids.

'Military-linked company'





HONG KONG: Chinese EV battery giant CATL aims to raise $4 billion in its Hong Kong listing scheduled for May 20, said a statement filed to the bourse Monday, making it the largest IPO expected in the city so far this year.A global leader in the sector, CATL produces more than a third of all electric vehicle (EV) batteries sold worldwide, working with major brands including Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen.The company is already listed in Shenzhen, and its plan for a secondary listing in Hong Kong was announced in a December filing with the stock exchange.According to a prospectus filed Monday, CATL will offer approximately 117.9 million units priced at up to HK$263 per share ($33.8) for total expected proceeds of HK$31.01 billion.The listing is set to take place next Tuesday (May 20).Cornerstone investors, including Sinopec and Kuwait Investment Authority, agreed to buy shares worth HK$2.62 billion, the prospectus shows.Founded in 2011 in the eastern Chinese city of Ningde, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (CATL) was initially propelled to success by rapid growth in the domestic market.But the world's largest EV market has more recently begun to show signs of flagging sales amid a broader slowdown in consumption.The trends have fuelled a fierce price war in China's expansive EV sector, putting smaller firms under huge pressure to compete while remaining financially viable.But CATL continues to post solid performances, with its net profit jumping 32.9 percent in the first quarter.Funds raised from a secondary listing could be used to accelerate CATL's overseas expansion, particularly in Europe.The battery giant is building its second factory on the continent in Hungary after launching its first in Germany in January 2023.In December, CATL announced that it would work with automotive giant Stellantis on a $4.3 billion factory to make EV batteries in Spain, with production slated to begin by the end of 2026.Earlier analysts said CATL's float could be a blockbuster initial public offering that could boost Hong Kong's fortunes as a listing hub.Hong Kong's stock exchange is eager for the return of big-name Chinese listings in hopes of regaining its crown as the world's top IPO venue.The Chinese finance hub saw a steady decline in new offerings since Beijing's regulatory crackdown starting in 2020 led some Chinese mega-companies to put their plans on hold.In a list issued in January by the US Defense Department, CATL was designated as a ""Chinese military company"".The United States House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party highlighted this inclusion in letters to two American banks in April, urging them to withdraw from the IPO deal with the ""Chinese military-linked company"".But the two American banks JPMorgan and Bank of America are still on the deal.Beijing has denounced the list as ""suppression"", while CATL denied engaging ""in any military related activities"".According to Bloomberg, CATL plans to make the deal as a ""Reg S"" offering, which doesn't allow sales to US onshore investors, limiting the company's exposure to legal risks in the United States.",Chinese ev battery giant catl aims to raise $4 bn in hong kong ipo.

MUMBAI: The India-UK free trade agreement will benefit Jaguar Land Rover 's future cars, as customers will be able to access them much faster, driving its performance in India, said the company's top executive.""The current cars already in India, the Range Rover franchise-Range Rover, Range Rover Sport, Evoque, and the Velar-are being manufactured in India on a CKD (completely knocked down) basis, so they won't be impacted by this FTA that is coming in,"" said director PB Balaji. ""This will benefit future cars, meaning customers will be able to access these global cars at global prices much faster.""Under the FTA, a fully-built car imported from the UK will be levied a 10% duty as against the existing 100%. JLR sold 6,183 vehicles in India in FY25.Regarding the US-UK trade deal , Balaji said, ""The situation is much better than what we were facing before. We await the fine print in terms of timings, whether it's applicable retrospectively or not. We also need a few clarifications in terms of what is due to parts and accessories.""The trade deal reduces tariffs on UK-built vehicles exported to the US to 10% from 27.5%, within a quota of one lakh vehicles. Any export beyond this quota will face the 27.5% tariff.The US accounts for a quarter of JLR's sales. It recently restarted shipments to the US after pausing them following the US's 27.5% tariffs on foreign-built vehicles that came into effect on April 3.""Whatever was shipped to the US will not have any impact if it is going to be a retrospective effect, as we will continue shipping from here on. We will have to wait to quantify the impact of the change in tariffs,"" Balaji said. The US tariff impacted Defender, one of JLR's most sold models in the US, as it is manufactured in Nitra, Slovakia. ""We remain optimistic that there will be a deal done between the EU and US as well, just like what happened between the UK and US,"" Balaji said.","The india-uk free trade agreement will benefit jaguar land rover's future cars, says the company's top executive.

UnitedHealth Group announced Tuesday that CEO Andrew Witty is stepping down for personal reasons as the company grapples with unexpectedly high medical costs and withdraws its full-year financial outlook for 2025.Chairman Stephen Hemsley will return as CEO, effective immediately. Hemsley, who previously served in the role from 2006 to 2017, will continue as chairman of the company’s board. Witty, 60, will remain with the company as a senior adviser, as per news agency AP.UnitedHealth’s decision comes during a turbulent time for the healthcare giant, which has faced growing scrutiny and financial headwinds in recent months. In December, executive Brian Thompson was killed outside a New York City hotel. While the incident was not tied to the company’s financial operations, it sent shockwaves through the corporate world and was followed by a dramatic decline in UnitedHealth shares.“I’m deeply disappointed in and apologize for the performance setbacks we have encountered from both external and internal challenges,” Hemsley said during an early Tuesday conference call.“Many of the issues standing in the way of achieving our goals as well as our opportunities are largely within our control. I am optimistic about our future as these issues are within our capacity to resolve. We will approach them with humility, rigor and urgency. ”Witty joined UnitedHealth in 2018 after a nearly decade-long tenure as CEO of British pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline. He took over the helm of UnitedHealth in February 2021, succeeding Dave Wichmann.Under Witty’s leadership, UnitedHealth experienced significant growth. The company’s revenue soared to more than $400 billion last year, a 55% jump from the $257 billion it posted the year before he became CEO. Its stock price also surged during that period, rising 60.5%.However, the last several months have marked a period of considerable challenge. UnitedHealth cut its financial forecast last month following its first quarterly earnings miss in over a decade. On Tuesday, the company withdrew its full-year guidance entirely, citing higher-than-expected medical expenses tied to newly enrolled Medicare Advantage members.The backdrop of rising costs and public scrutiny has added to investor unease. The ongoing high-profile case surrounding Luigi Mangione, who was indicted last month on federal murder charges in the death of Thompson, has stirred national attention and contributed to a broader wave of criticism toward health insurers.Shares of UnitedHealth have fallen sharply—down 38% since Thompson’s killing on December 4—plunging more than 16% on Tuesday to their lowest levels in nearly five years.UnitedHealth Group Inc. serves more than 50 million Americans through its various health insurance offerings. In addition to its core insurance operations, it runs a major pharmacy benefit manager and its Optum division, which provides healthcare services and technical infrastructure.The company is also the nation’s largest provider of Medicare Advantage plans, with over 8 million enrollees in privately run versions of the government health program for seniors.","Unitedhealth group announced tuesday that ceo andrew witty is stepping down for personal reasons.

The dividend payout will be completed within 30 days of the AGM, as per an ET report.The company’s EBITDA for the fourth quarter stood at Rs 1,416 crore, reflecting a 4% YoY growth, while its Profit Before Tax (PBT) increased by 7% to reach Rs 1,442 crore.

The EBITDA margin for the year stood at 14.4%, an improvement of 40 basis points over the previous year. This margin expansion was driven by a favourable product mix, enhanced cost efficiencies, and a decrease in commodity costs.Hero MotoCorp credited its strong performance to significant growth across the premium, scooter, and electric vehicle (EV) segments, fuelled by a series of successful product launches. Export volumes also exceeded industry trends, and the company expanded its premium retail footprint in India while entering new global markets.“We are observing strong retail traction, especially in our new premium and scooter offerings. Continued consolidation in the core segment, growth in the 125cc category, and the upcoming EV launch position us well for sustained momentum,” said Vikram S Kasbekar, Executive Director and Acting CEO of Hero MotoCorp.The company continued to push forward with its premiumization strategy, launching several new high-end models during FY25, including the Xtreme 250R, Xpulse 210, and the 2024 edition of the Xtreme 160R 2V.

Nissan Motor Corp is slashing about 15% of its global workforce—around 20,000 employees—and cutting its number of auto plants from 17 to 10, as the Japanese automaker reported a 670.9 billion yen ($4.5 billion) loss for the fiscal year ending in March. The sharp downturn comes amid falling vehicle sales in China and other key markets.The Yokohama-based company outlined the sweeping cuts as part of a broader recovery plan designed to carry out what it called “decisive and bold actions to enhance performance and create a leaner, more resilient business that adapts quickly to market changes.”The company also cited US tariffs on auto imports under President Donald Trump as a factor that hurt its performance, according to news agency AP.Nissan is targeting a cost reduction of 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion) during the next fiscal year, compared to its results from the year that just ended.The 2024 fiscal year loss marks a dramatic reversal from the previous year, when Nissan posted a 426.6 billion yen profit. Restructuring expenses also weighed heavily on its bottom line.Chief Financial Officer Jeremie Papin told reporters the automaker faces serious challenges in achieving a turnaround, but stressed it has enough financial resources to carry it through.“We have enough cash to do so,” he said.Nissan is expected to be the hardest hit by the 25% U.S. import tariff. “Its clientele has historically been more price-sensitive than that of its rivals,” Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Tatsuo Yoshida told AFP, adding that Nissan “can’t pass the costs on to consumers to the same extent as Toyota or Honda without suffering a significant loss in sales units.”As part of its restructuring strategy, Nissan said it will aim to cut costs by 250 billion yen ($1.7 billion) over the next fiscal year. The company described its new direction as a move to implement “decisive and bold actions to enhance performance and create a leaner, more resilient business that adapts quickly to market changes.”""In China, we will strengthen our market performance by unleashing multiple new-energy vehicles,"" Nissan added in a statement. The company, like many traditional automakers, has struggled to keep pace with the rapid rise of Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers.Ratings agencies have downgraded Nissan to junk status, with Moody’s citing “weak profitability” and an “ageing model portfolio” as key factors. Shares in the company have plummeted nearly 40% over the past year.Earlier this month, Nissan also scrapped plans for a $1 billion battery plant in southern Japan, citing the difficult “business environment."", as reported news agency AFP.A potential merger with Japanese rival Honda had been viewed as a possible lifeline, but talks collapsed in February after Honda proposed turning Nissan into a subsidiary. Despite that, Chief Operating Officer Ivan Espinosa—who became CEO in March—said the company remains “open to collaborating with multiple partners,” including Honda.Nissan has faced numerous setbacks in recent years, most notably the 2018 arrest of former chairman Carlos Ghosn on financial misconduct charges. Ghosn later escaped Japan in a dramatic and controversial fashion, reportedly hiding in an audio equipment box.Espinosa acknowledged on Tuesday that the automaker faces serious challenges in achieving a turnaround but emphasized its financial stability: “We have enough cash to do so,” he told reporters.",Nissan motor corp is slashing about 15% of its global workforce and cutting its number of auto plants from 17 to 10.
