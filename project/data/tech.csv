‘Safe harbour’ not an absolute right, but a privilege contingent upon strict adherence to statutory duties: Govt

NEW DELHI: The Centre told Karnataka high court Thursday that allowing the proliferation of unlawful content on social media in the name of free speech endangered democracy, and accused Elon Musk-owned X of attempting to escape accountability by taking shelter under the IT Act’s ‘safe harbour’ protection.Questioning the US-based company’s locus standi to move an Indian HC for protection of fundamental rights, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said the constitutional protection to freedom of speech under Article 19(1)(a) must not be misunderstood as absolute protection for unlawful content.“Constitutional jurisprudence clearly differentiates between protected speech that contributes meaningfully to democratic discourse and unlawful speech that undermines societal stability and individual rights,” it said.It said the ‘safe harbour’ provision, which protects social media platforms from liability for content posed by their users, was a privilege available only to those internet intermediaries which were responsible.X had moved HC seeking to restrain govt departments from taking coercive action against it and its officials for the content on the microblogging site and said, “Unlawful and unjustified orders harm the X platform and its ability to operate.The issuance of information blocking orders without following due process of law, and in violation of IT Act and the Constitution, violates X’s right to equality under Article 14 and detrimentally impacts its business. ”In written submissions before HC, solicitor general Tushar Mehta said, “Proliferation of what can be termed as unlawful content on social media platforms poses an unprecedented threat to public discourse, democracy and societal stability.”“Social media intermediaries possess an unparalleled ability to amplify information instantaneously, without traditional barriers like language or geographical limitations, and thus carry significant responsibilities,” the law officer said.Advent of the internet, social media and digital intermediaries had fundamentally altered the character and scale of human communication, demanding a re-examination and suitable tailoring of constitutional standards, Mehta said, adding India’s internet subscriber base had grown from 25 crore in 2013-14 to 97 crore in Sept 2024.The govt’s stand that ‘safe harbour’ does not mean blanket immunity can have implications for all social media platforms. This also rhymes with the growing call for repeal of Section 230 of US's Communications Decency Act from which social media giants derive the immunity.The Centre said ‘safe harbour’ protection for internet intermediaries was not an unconditional entitlement but a privilege contingent upon strict adherence to statutory duties. While committing to full protection of the right to free speech, the govt said, “The question raised by X cannot be examined merely from the prism of the person using this medium.“The concept of ‘safe harbour’ inherently includes rigorous responsibilities, requiring intermediaries to promptly and effectively remove or disable unlawful content upon receiving notice. These safeguards are deliberately designed to balance innovation with accountability, ensuring intermediaries do not become platforms for unlawful activities.”The govt said X’s attempt was to present ‘safe harbour’ as an absolute right, devoid of any corresponding duties. “Such a stand fundamentally misconstrues the very basis of this legal protection. ‘Safe harbour’ is not a constitutional guarantee but a statutory privilege, specifically designed to foster responsible conduct,” it said.It told HC that X had confused itself with the play of Sections 69A and 79 of the IT Act. It said Section 69A pertains explicitly to govt orders for blocking content with serious penal consequences for non-compliance whereas Section 79 deals with due diligence obligations to maintain ‘safe harbour’ protection.The Centre said X purposefully blurred the clear distinction to escape accountability for its statutory duties. It said social media platforms use ‘amplification’ mechanisms to push visibility of a particular type of view.“The algorithms used by intermediaries actively curate and boost content, shaping public opinion and significantly influencing social harmony or disorder. This active role demands heightened accountability, necessitating robust regulation specifically tailored for social media, distinct from traditional media,” the Centre further said.",The centre told karnataka high court thursday that allowing the proliferation of unlawful content on social media in the name of free speech endangered democracy. It accused elon musk-owned x of attempting to escape accountability by taking shelter under the it act’s ‘safe harbour’ protection.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-122699720,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-20542,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Delhi's phone war: BJP alleges AAP leaders bought mobiles with government funds; AAP attacks rise in purchase cap,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/delhis-phone-war-bjp-alleges-aap-leaders-bought-mobiles-with-government-funds-aap-attacks-rise-in-purchase-cap/articleshow/122653153.cms,"ANI file photos

NEW DELHI: Delhi Home Minister Ashish Sood on Thursday alleged that AAP leaders Arvind Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia purchased several top‑of‑the‑line mobile phones on government funds.Citing a 2013 government circular that allows the chief minister and ministers to buy phones worth up to Rs 50,000 and Rs 45,000 respectively, Sood showed documents that suggested Kejriwal bought an iPhone 6s Plus for Rs 81,000 in 2015, an iPhone 7 Plus for Rs 69,000 in 2017, an iPhone 12 Pro Max worth Rs 1.39 lakh during the Covid period in 2020, and an iPhone 13 Pro Max for Rs 1.63 lakh in July 2022.He further said Manish Sisodia had purchased five expensive handsets between 2017 and 2022, including Samsung Galaxy S8 models costing nearly Rs 60,000 and iPhones priced between Rs 1.12 lakh and Rs 1.66 lakh. Former minister Atishi too allegedly bought a phone for Rs 1.27 lakh in 2023, though the entitled reimbursement was only Rs 45,000.Delhi CM Rekha Gupta also weighed in with a poetic jibe on social media. She wrote, “AAP’s cap was hiding a whole market — every move filled with scams! They bought costly phones for themselves, now the truth is out so smile! The truth fears no one, and this matter will be investigated.”The allegations from the Delhi BJP come after AAP criticised the recent move by the Delhi government that raises the stipulated limit for purchase of mobile phones by the chief minister and ministers to Rs 1.5 lakh and Rs 1.25 lakh respectively.The party accused the BJP of neglecting women’s monthly support schemes and instead spending public money on luxury phones and extra staff for MLAs.The Aam Aadmi Party rebutted the allegations by Sood, calling them ""false"" and a “political sabotage” aimed at derailing the previous government’s welfare initiatives. AAP Delhi president Saurabh Bharadwaj pointed out that the BJP had failed on its promises to the people of Delhi and was now targeting opposition leaders with “smokescreen” charges.","Delhi home minister ashish sood alleged that aap leaders arvind kejriwal and manish sisodia purchased several top‑of‑the‑line mobile phones on government funds.

The outreach, the love. I think it was meant for me, and it was meant for everybody.”He further said, “Through all social media, talking about over 100 million reactions of emotions and of unifying on one thing. So if anything, it shows that we all can come together on something. Regardless of what, how, when, where, boom, we all came together on something. So that was showing that good in humanity, man.

Walmart slashed 1,500 jobs



Walmart, America’s largest retailer has announced the fresh round of layoffs.

While the company has not disclosed the number of laid off employees, but reports indicate this round of layoffs will affect of hundreds of employees across various locations. The move to reduce the workforce is part of the company’s restructuring efforts and is aimed at streamlining operations and adapting to evolving retail landscapes.As reported by Bloomberg, in a memo to employees, Cedric Clark, executive vice president of store operations at Walrmart US said that the company is removing market coordinator positions— the corporate role which assists market managers who oversee multiple stores. “We’re simplifying our market support structure, reducing touchpoints and friction for our store associates,” said Cedric Clark in the memo.The memo also emphasised that the job cuts are part of a shift towards simplifying the market support structure and “reduce touchpoints and friction for store associates”. Along with this, the retailer is also eliminating coach and coordinator roles at Walmart Academy , which is training division for the store managers and employees.The report also adds that the impacted employees will be offered store-level coach roles in their local areas.This move follows earlier restructuring steps, including the closure of Walmart’s North Carolina office and relocation of staff to hubs in Arkansas and California.

Apple iPhone 17 series manufacturing has reportedly started in India

Apple has reportedly set a new milestone in India in the first six months of 2025. According to a report in Economic Times, the iPhone-maker has reportedly achieved the fastest ramp-up in iPhone production and exports from India in the first half of 2025 ever since it started smartphone assembly in the country in 2017. The move is said to be an attempt on Apple's part to diversify global production amid threat of higher US tariffs on Chinese imports.Quoting market researcher Canalys, the report said that iPhone production in India surged 53% on-year during the January to June period, reaching 23.9 million units. As per research firm Cybermedia Research (CMR), iPhone export volumes touched 22.88 million units in H1 2025, from 15.05 million a year earlier, an increase of 52%. In value terms, Apple exported $22.56 billion worth of iPhones from India in the first half of 2025, compared to $14.71 billion a year earlier as per CMR. ""This shift reflects improving yield rates, line maturity, and Apple's growing confidence in India as a core manufacturing base,"" said Sanyam Chaurasia, analyst, Canalys.Apple also faces a significant challenge in India as President Trump has warned the company about imposing 25% tariff on imported iPhones if they are not manufactured within US borders. ""I have long ago informed Tim Cook of Apple that I expect their iPhones that will be sold in the United States of America will be manufactured and built in the United States, not India, or anyplace else,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social in May. ""If that is not the case, a Tariff of at least 25% must be paid by Apple to the US.""Apple transported five planes full of iPhones and other products from India to the US in just three days during the final week of March. The urgent shipments were made to avoid a new 10% reciprocal tariff imposed by US President Donald Trump’s administration that took effect on April 5. Apple's US warehouses are reportedly stocked for several months ahead with 'made-in-India' iPhones. Analyst said that stockpiling was aimed to allow Apple to maintain current pricing temporarily. “The reserves that arrived at lower duty will temporarily insulate the company from the higher prices that it will need to pay for new shipments under the revised tax rates,” a source explained to TOI.In May, the US government later declared a 90-day pause on imposing reciprocal tariffs for most of its trading partners till July 9, which has since been extended to August 1. For India, the US has proposed a 26% tariff.Foxconn (Hon Hai) and Tata Electronics are the leading manufacturers of iPhones in India. Last year, Tata Electronics took over operations of Wistron and Pegatron plants in the country.Apple is now reportedly planning to undertake simultaneous day-one manufacturing of the upcoming iPhone 17 in China and India. Apple iPhone 17 series is likely set for launch in September. Components for the iPhone 17 are reported to have already started arriving at the Foxconn plant in Tamil Nadu. ""While not officially confirmed, the volume and type of these imports make it highly likely that trial production or early-stage assembly has commenced, months ahead of Apple's typical September launch window. This would mark a new benchmark with the earliest ever flagship ramp-up from India,"" Chaurasia said.","Iphone production in india surged 53% on-year during the january to june period, reaching 23.9 million units.

2️⃣ GTA VI will cost $80 (there will be premium versions of course, but the base price is $80)

3️⃣ GTA VI is the next UGC platform. It will have a UGC component that includes creator payouts for server hosts, mod creators, and more (mimicking the creator economics of UEFN and Roblox)

4️⃣ GTA VI will have 200-person lobbies, and there will be higher risk/reward dynamics where you can raid and steal items from players more easily

5️⃣ GTA VI will break even on its $2bn investment <30 days of release

6️⃣ GTA VI will hit the attached chart of copies sold, revenue, and player targets.

We can't wait for this title to be released in 2026. I'll certainly be playing it.”

Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason

Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6) is set to launch in May next year. Meanwhile, investment firm Konvoy has made some major predictions for the upcoming open world title’s financial performance. The video game venture capitalist company suggests that GTA 6 will generate $7.6 billion in revenue within just two months or 60 days of its release. Josh Chapman, a managing partner of Konvoy, shared this forecast on a post shared on the professional networking site LinkedIn. He highlighted that the firm believes that the highly anticipated game will have major commercial success. However, it's important to note that Konvoy's projection is based on certain assumptions that Take-Two Interactive has not yet confirmed, such as an $80 price point for the game and a reported budget of around $2 billion, which the company is said to have spent to develop the game.Konvoy's analysis suggests that GTA 6 could recover its estimated $2 billion budget in under 30 days and build considerable momentum. The firm predicts that it may become the gaming industry’s biggest launch to date and is expected to break records for both copies sold and revenue generated by a game. Considering that analysts have referred to GTA 6 as ""the most important game to ever release in the industry,"" a multi-billion dollar revenue figure may be within reach for the title.In his LinkedIn post, Chapman wrote:",Grand theft auto 6 (gta 6) is set to launch in may next year.

Mark Zuckerberg to build Manhattan-sized AI data center in Meta’s superintelligence drive,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/mark-zuckerberg-to-build-manhattan-sized-ai-data-center-in-metas-superintelligence-drive/articleshow/122622532.cms,"Mark Zuckerberg bets big on superclusters to drive Meta’s AGI ambitions



Talent raids, new leadership, and the future of Meta’s AI division

In a move to solidify Meta’s position in the race for artificial general intelligence (AGI), CEO Mark Zuckerberg has announced plans to build a data center nearly the size of Manhattan. The facility, described as a multi-gigawatt titan cluster, will support the company’s ambitious AI initiatives, including its newly formed Superintelligence Labs division. As part of its broader AI strategy, Meta plans to spend hundreds of billions of dollars over the coming years, reflecting the scale and urgency of its vision.With superclusters like Prometheus set to come online in 2026 and Hyperion following, Meta aims to outpace rivals like OpenAI and Google in the development of next-generation AI models and infrastructure.Zuckerberg confirmed that Meta is building several massive AI compute clusters, each with the energy footprint of a small city. One such facility, Prometheus, will be the company’s first multi-gigawatt data center, while Hyperion is designed to scale up to 5 gigawatts over time.These efforts are intended to support the creation of superintelligent AI systems—machines capable of outperforming humans in a wide range of tasks. To fund this vision, Meta raised its 2025 capital expenditure estimate to between $64 billion and $72 billion. Zuckerberg cited the company’s strong ad revenue, $165 billion last year, as a key enabler of such spending. “We have the capital from our business to do this,” he told investors.In addition to infrastructure, Meta is aggressively investing in talent. The company recently formed Superintelligence Labs, a new division led by former Scale AI CEO Alexandr Wang and ex-GitHub chief Nat Friedman. Zuckerberg has reportedly led a personal effort to attract top-tier researchers, offering multimillion-dollar packages, some reaching $100 million, to secure talent from rival firms.These hires follow challenges with Meta’s open-source Llama 4 model and the departure of key staff. With new AI applications like Meta AI, image-to-video ad tools, and smart glasses in development, the company is working to diversify beyond its traditional social media roots. Industry analysts suggest Meta could become the first company to bring a gigawatt-plus AI supercluster online, cementing its leadership in the global AI race.","Mark zuckerberg bets big on superclusters to drive meta’s agi ambitions.

A restaurant in northern China has sparked outrage after offering customers the chance to cuddle lion cubs while enjoying afternoon tea.Animal welfare groups and social media users are slamming the experience as exploitative and dangerous.The Wanhui restaurant is situated in Taiyuan City in Shanxi province. It allows guests to handle the young lions as part of a four-course tea set, priced at 1,078 yuan ($150). Since opening in June, the venue has been selling around 20 tickets daily for the experience, which also features other animals such as llamas, deer, and turtles. Videos and photos of customers cradling the lion cubs have gone viral on Chinese social media platforms like WeChat and Weibo.Animal rights advocates have condemned the practice, warning of both ethical and safety concerns. “Tearing lion cubs from their mothers so diners can handle them over afternoon tea is exploitation, not entertainment. These animals are living, feeling beings, not toys,” Jason Baker, Senior vice president at People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), told news agency Reuters.Baker also criticised the trend of using animals for viral content, adding, “The animals were treated like nothing more than social media props.”Peter Li, a policy expert on China for Humane World for Animals, also raised concerns about the risks involved. “Exploiting wild animals for selfies and marketing gimmicks is not only appallingly bad animal welfare, it's also potentially risky for customers,” he was quoted as saying to Reuters. “Even a young lion is capable of lashing out and injuring a human. So, treating wild animals like props is both morally unacceptable and dangerously irresponsible. ”Despite the backlash, the restaurant has defended itself, claiming the cubs are in good health and under professional care. “They were taken care of very well, with specialised carers to tend to them,” a representative told Reuters.This incident follows another controversial hospitality service in China last month, when authorities launched an investigation into a hotel in Chongqing for its so-called “wake-up service” using red pandas. The animals were allowed to climb onto guests’ beds to rouse them in the mornings, drawing similar criticism from animal rights groups.","A restaurant in northern china has sparked outrage after offering customers the chance to cuddle lion cubs while enjoying afternoon tea.

In a first-of-its-kind move, the Chinese city of Shenzhen has started using autonomous delivery robots inside its subway network to restock 7-Eleven convenience stores located at various stations, South China Morning Post reported.The project, which began on Monday, involves 41 robots operated by VX Logistics, a subsidiary of property developer Vanke. Vanke is partly owned by Shenzhen Metro. According to a report by local news outlet SZNews, as cited by SCMP, these metre-tall robots are designed to ride elevators, get on and off platforms, board trains, and deliver goods to stores across the subway system.SZNews reported, as cited by SCMP, that the robots travel during off-peak hours and automatically exit at designated stations where 7-Eleven outlets are located. The machines then carry out deliveries that were earlier done manually by staff.""In the past, delivery workers had to park above ground, unload goods, and manually push them into subway stations,"" Li Yanyan, a manager at one of the 7-Eleven stores involved in the project, told SZNews, as quoted by South China Morning Post. ""Now, with robots, it’s much easier and more convenient.""The initiative is aimed at reducing the logistical challenges faced by shop staff working in metro stations.On their first day, the robots drew attention from passengers who stopped to take pictures as they lined up inside train carriages.The delivery system will be used to supply more than 100 7-Eleven stores located inside Shenzhen's subway stations.""These robots are specially designed with unique chassis systems that allow them to cross gaps to enter lifts and carriages,"" said Hou Shangjie, head of automation at VX Logistics, as quoted by SCMP.
