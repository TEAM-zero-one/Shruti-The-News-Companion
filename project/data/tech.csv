Rajnath Singh launches Indian company's defence unit near Casablanca,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/rajnath-singh-launches-indian-companys-defence-unit-near-casablanca/articleshow/124080891.cms,"Rajnath Singh & Moroccan trade minister Ryad Mezzour in Rabat

NEW DELHI: A modern defence manufacturing facility for armoured vehicles near Casablanca in Morocco, the first such Indian private sector plant in Africa, was inaugurated by Union defence minister Rajnath Singh and his counterpart Abdelatif Loudyi Tuesday.The facility, set up by Tata Advanced Systems Limited, will produce wheeled armoured platforms (WhAP 8x8), which it has jointly designed with DRDO. Equipped with advanced mobility, protection and mission adaptability, the WhAP can be configured as an infantry fighting vehicle; armoured personnel carrier; reconnaissance, command post, mortar carrier; and even an ambulance.Singh said India’s vision of ‘ Atmanirbhar Bharat ’ is not just to manufacture defence platforms and tech for its own needs, but to develop capabilities that allow the country to become a credible source of advanced technology and high-quality products for the world.“For India, self-reliance does not mean isolation. Rather, we aim to develop strategic autonomy. We want to develop capabilities that allow us to defend our nation independently, while maintaining engagement with global partners. Along with ‘Make in India’, we are pursuing ‘Make with Friends’ & ‘Make for World’,” he added.Describing the occasion as “a historic moment” in the evolving bilateral strategic partnership, Singh said Morocco’s strategic location as a gateway to Africa and Europe makes the TASL facility an important hub for exports and collaboration.Spread over 20,000 square metres, the facility will begin delivering WhAP 8x8 vehicles to Royal Moroccan Army from next month.","The facility, set up by tata advanced systems limited, will produce wheeled armoured platforms (whap 8x8), which it has jointly designed with drdo. The whap can be configured as an infantry fighting vehicle; armoured personnel carrier; reconnaissance, command post, mortar carrier; and even an ambulance.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124080889,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-896745,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

In a big cheer at the start of the festive season, the next generation GST reforms announced by the Modi government come into effect today, on September 22, 2025.From today, a plethora of household items, cars, TVs, bikes will become cheaper for the common man and middle class.

The internet rarely misses a scandal, and Brittney Jones knows exactly how to keep herself in the headlines. The adult content creator and OnlyFans star has now inserted herself into the whirlwind surrounding Cardi B ’s pregnancy with NFL wide receiver Stefon Diggs , turning an already viral story into a full-blown social media circus.Brittney Jones has been a recognizable name in internet gossip circles long before her latest claims about Diggs. She first made waves six years ago when she alleged she was pregnant with R&B singer Trey Songz’s baby, later admitting she fabricated the story to “hurt him.” That incident set the tone for her online persona—unfiltered, unapologetic, and always willing to stir conversation.Since then, Jones has leaned into her notoriety, building a sizable following on X, where she now interacts with over 340,000 fans. Her content often blends humor with controversy, and she doesn’t shy away from exposing private details about her alleged encounters with celebrities. That combination has cemented her reputation as one of social media’s most unpredictable figures.When Cardi B confirmed she is expecting her fourth child, this time with Diggs, fans initially celebrated the rapper’s new chapter. But Jones quickly stole the spotlight, sharing screenshots of alleged payments from Diggs and even hinting at explicit videos.Her posts included jaw-dropping claims: “That boy got some good-a** d**k, so I understand her trapping him.”Also Read: NFL analyst slams Donald Trump’s remarks at Charlie Kirk memorial as “absolutely insane” Whether fans see her as a truth-teller or a clout-chaser, Jones has successfully placed herself at the heart of one of 2025’s wildest celebrity sagas.

The recent H-1B visa fees hike announced by US President Donald Trump created an atmosphere of chaos. The massive hike in the H-1B visa fees rattled the tech industry. Many of the tech giants including Google, Microsoft, Amazon asked the professionals on H-1B visa to return to the US by September 21. As per the revised regulations the companies that are recruiting foreign professionals will now have to submit $1,00,000 payment for each H-1B application. Many on the popular beneficiaries of the visa system have not yet voiced their opinion on this new change. However, amidst this visa fee hike an old post of Tesla CEO Elon Musk has surfaced online. In the post being shared online Musk can be seen speaking in favour of the H-1B visa system.In a fiery exchange on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), Musk has credited the visa program for allowing his journey and also for powering America’s tech dominance.Musk wrote.Musk also went ahead and vowed to ‘go to war’ in order to defend the system against its critics.

With the new $100,000 fee, the economics of hiring foreign talent have been upended, sparking fears of layoffs, relocations, and a potential reverse migration back to India.Musk’s past words — contrasting with his more recent criticisms of the program as “broken” — highlight the tensions between business needs, political rhetoric, and immigration realities.","The recent h-1b visa fees hike announced by us president donald trump created an atmosphere of chaos.

Impact of H-1B fee hike on US tech and economy





The H-1B visa, introduced by the United States in 1990, has long been a pathway for highly skilled professionals from across the globe to contribute to America’s technology sector. Many of today’s tech leaders, including Elon Musk, Sundar Pichai, and Satya Nadella, entered the US through this programme, allowing them to innovate, lead companies, and create global impact. These visas have been instrumental in building Silicon Valley and advancing AI, cloud computing, and consumer technology. With the recent $100,000 fee imposed on new H-1B applicants, it’s more important than ever to recognise the pivotal role these H-1B holders have played in shaping the US tech ecosystem.Musk initially entered the US on a J-1 exchange visa and later obtained an H-1B to pursue academic training and business ventures. He has been central to the success of SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink, and X Corp, employing thousands of engineers and professionals globally. Musk credits the H-1B programme for enabling him and other highly talented individuals to create groundbreaking technologies, from reusable rockets to mass-market electric vehicles.His advocacy for skilled immigration highlights the importance of global talent in driving innovation and maintaining America’s leadership in tech.Pichai came to the US as an international student before transitioning to an H-1B visa, which allowed him to join Google in product management roles. Over the years, he rose to become CEO of Alphabet, overseeing key innovations in AI, Google Cloud, and hardware like Pixel phones and Nest devices. Pichai’s leadership has guided Google through major technological shifts, expanding AI research, cloud services, and consumer applications, positioning Google as a global technology leader.Nadella moved to the US in the early 1990s and obtained an H-1B visa to work at Microsoft. Rising through the ranks, he became CEO in 2014, leading Microsoft’s transformation through cloud computing, AI, and enterprise solutions. Nadella emphasises the critical role of skilled immigrants in fostering innovation and growth, highlighting that many of Microsoft’s most transformative projects have been driven by talent brought to the US through H-1B.Srinivas arrived in the US as a student and leveraged his H-1B visa to work in AI research. He later founded Perplexity AI, a company valued at $9 billion, offering cutting-edge AI solutions globally. His journey highlights the link between skilled immigration and leadership in next-generation technology.Yuan, a Chinese immigrant, faced multiple visa rejections before securing his H-1B to enter the US. He founded Zoom, which became an essential tool for global communication during the COVID-19 pandemic, supporting millions of remote workers, schools, and enterprises. Yuan’s story demonstrates how H-1B visas enable entrepreneurs to build companies that have a global impact.Bansal came to the US on an H-1B visa in 2000 and founded AppDynamics, a software monitoring company. AppDynamics grew rapidly and was acquired for $3.7 billion, creating significant employment opportunities and boosting the tech ecosystem. Bansal’s entrepreneurial success underscores the value H-1B holders bring to innovation and economic growth.Arvind Krishna, who moved to the US from India on an H-1B visa, is the current Chairman and CEO of IBM, exemplifying how skilled immigration drives innovation. Born in Dehradun, India, he earned a B.Tech from IIT Kanpur and a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign. Joining IBM in 1990, Krishna rose through leadership roles in research, cloud, and cognitive software, playing a pivotal role in IBM’s $34 billion Red Hat acquisition. Since becoming CEO in 2020, he has steered the company toward AI, hybrid cloud, and quantum technologies, while contributing patents and advancing global tech research.H-1B holders have been vital in founding, running, and scaling technology companies, filling high-skilled roles, driving innovation, and creating trillions in market value. Companies like Microsoft, Amazon, Google, Apple, and Indian-origin firms like TCS rely on these visas to access global talent that fuels growth and competitiveness in the tech industry. These skilled professionals are often the backbone of innovation hubs and help maintain the US’s global leadership in technology. Their contributions extend beyond tech, impacting research, education, and economic growth nationwide.The recent $100,000 fee for new H-1B applications has caused global concern, with tech leaders warning that such measures could limit access to skilled talent and slow innovation. Despite these hurdles, H-1B holders continue to demonstrate their vital role in shaping America’s technology landscape, proving that skilled immigrants remain essential to the country’s innovation and economic strength. H-1B holders aren’t just numbers on a visa list—they’re the people behind the apps, tools, and tech we use every day. Their creativity and skills keep America’s tech ecosystem buzzing and competitive on a global scale.","Donald trump's h-1b visa fee hike shocks tech giants and indians, experts call the move 'regressive' many of today’s tech leaders entered the us through this programme, allowing them to innovate, lead companies, and create global impact.

Arc’teryx and Cai Guo-Qiang respond to the controversy

Public backlash and media scrutiny





A recent fireworks display in the Himalayas by renowned artist Cai Guo-Qiang, in collaboration with Canadian outdoor brand Arc’teryx, has sparked widespread criticism from climate activists and social media users. The display, titled “Rising Dragon,” took place on a Tibetan plateau at an altitude of approximately 5,500 meters in Shigatse. Videos of the colourful pyrotechnics quickly circulated online, drawing ire from environmentalists who argued that the stunt disregarded the fragile Himalayan ecosystem. In response, Arc’teryx and Cai Guo-Qiang issued public apologies, while authorities launched an investigation into the ecological impact and regulatory approval of the event.The “Rising Dragon” fireworks display was a collaboration between Cai Guo-Qiang, the acclaimed artist behind the 2008 Beijing Olympic Games pyrotechnics, and Arc’teryx, a Canadian outdoor apparel brand now owned by Chinese sports giant Anta Sports. The event, staged at a high-altitude Tibetan plateau, was intended as a visually striking artistic and marketing spectacle, symbolizing creativity and brand presence in remote and dramatic landscapes.Videos released online showed vibrant, multicolored fireworks forming a winding dragon across the mountain peaks. While designed to captivate audiences and highlight Arc’teryx’s adventurous brand ethos, the display quickly ignited environmental concerns, given the region’s fragile ecosystem and its sensitivity to human activity.Following mounting criticism, Arc’teryx apologised on social media, acknowledging that the event contradicted its commitment to outdoor conservation and responsible practices. The brand announced it would invite a third-party environmental organization to assess any ecological damage and implement corrective measures, emphasizing transparency and accountability in its future projects.Cai Guo-Qiang, known for his elaborate gunpowder artworks and pyrotechnics, issued a public apology on Chinese social media, admitting that several environmental considerations were overlooked. He expressed regret and vowed to cooperate fully with authorities’ investigation while committing to implement stricter safety and environmental measures in future projects.Despite issuing formal apologies, Arc’teryx and artist Cai Guo-Qiang continued to face sharp criticism from both the public and the media. Chinese state outlets, including the Global Times, scrutinized the brand for inconsistencies in its statements across different platforms, highlighting a perceived gap between its commitment to environmental responsibility and the actual execution of the fireworks display. Social media users on Weibo and Douyin called for accountability, not only from the brand and the artist but also from local officials who approved the event, arguing that there should be consequences for actions that risk damaging sensitive ecosystems.Environmentalists emphasized that the Himalayas, home to fragile flora and fauna and crucial water sources, are particularly vulnerable to human interference. Many commentators framed the display as a case study in the tension between corporate marketing ambitions and environmental stewardship, questioning whether extreme artistic stunts should ever be conducted in protected or remote natural areas. The debate extended beyond China, with global audiences engaging on platforms like Instagram and Twitter, reflecting a growing international awareness of the environmental responsibilities brands hold when executing high-visibility campaigns.","A recent fireworks display in the himalayas by renowned artist cai guo-qiang has sparked widespread criticism from climate activists and social media users.

Why the change matters





In a sweeping policy change aimed at tightening oversight and boosting local entrepreneurship, Kuwait’s Ministry of Commerce and Industry has officially restricted 120 freelance business activities to Kuwaiti citizens only. The move, backed by a ministerial resolution, introduces a new framework for licensing, compliance, and business operations, while extending freelance licences from one to four years.Under Ministerial Resolution No. 168 of 2025, issued by Khalifa Al-Ajeel, Kuwait’s Minister of Commerce and Industry, the country now mandates that only Kuwaiti citizens can own and operate freelance businesses under a licensed structure. The new resolution explicitly bars expatriates, including GCC nationals, from participating in any of the 120 defined freelance activities — whether as founders, partners, or managers.To qualify, applicants must meet a detailed set of conditions:The applicant must also be the company’s sole manager, and licences are non-transferable to non-Kuwaitis under the current resolution.Several procedural and structural upgrades have been introduced to make freelancing more accessible for Kuwaitis:All existing licensed businesses, regardless of when they were originally established, must also adhere to the updated rules without exception — though their current licences still remain valid.To ensure transparency, all licensed freelancers are now required to:This information will be reviewed by the Ministry and forwarded to the Public Authority for Manpower, aligning with Cabinet Decision No. 391 of 2001 and its subsequent amendments.The newly defined 120 freelance activities primarily span consultancy, creative services, rentals, events, tourism, and brokerage. Some of the major categories under the umbrella include:This broad list is being actively overseen by the Ministry’s Trade Classification Committee, which holds authority to define, revise, or remove any activity under the freelance category in the future.This resolution is part of a broader effort to recalibrate Kuwait’s economic environment by strengthening individual entrepreneurial initiatives while ensuring strong regulatory compliance. It reflects a dual focus: simplifying licensing for small businesses and tightening controls to ensure alignment with environmental, health, and legal standards.The move also closely aligns with Kuwait’s broader nationalisation agenda, aiming to localise key economic activities and strategically expand job opportunities for citizens across emerging and non-traditional sectors.Published officially in Kuwait Al-Youm, the decree confirms earlier reports — including one by Al-Anba on June 29 — about a forthcoming shift in the governance of freelance businesses. The Ministry positions this step as critical to boosting national economic participation, promoting transparency, and ensuring that micro-enterprises genuinely contribute to the country’s development.","Kuwait’s ministry of commerce and industry has officially restricted 120 freelance business activities to kuwaiti citizens only.

Britain Pounces On Trump’s H-1B Visa Chaos With Zero-Fee Plan For World’s Brightest | Watch

What is the process of switching from H-1B to Green Card?







The H-1B conundrum has triggered speculations that other visa categories also will face some heat from the Donald Trump administration -- limiting the entry of foreigners in the United States. In a major H-1B overhaul, the administration announced $100k fee, an astronomical hike in the H-1B visa fee.The fee will have to be paid by the companies that apply to hire H-1Bs and won't affect existing H-1B visa holders.But international students in the US are now losing their sleep as their future of getting hired by companies once they finish their courses will become bleak once they become H-1Bs. International students on F-1 visa will not have to pay any increased fee because of the H-1B fee revision but when they enter the workforce after completing OPT (Optional Practical Training) and move to H-1B through employer sponsorship, their chances of getting hired will significantly reduce.Big tech firms may pay the $100,000 fee to hire foreign employees, but the chance of international students getting jobs in startups and mid-sized firms will become less likely.Existing H-1B visa holders have been spared from the recent overhaul but they are now looking for permanent residency to escape any further action from the administration.To get a Green Card, the employer will have to be willing to sponsor the applicant, proving that there are no qualified US workers available for the job. The employer files Form I-140 with USCIS once the Perm (Program Electronic Review Management) or labor certification is approved.

"H-1B visa fee hike: What is H-1B visa, who it affects, what it means for foreign workers in the US, and other FAQs",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/h-1b-visa-fee-hike-what-is-h-1b-visa-who-it-affects-what-it-means-for-foreign-workers-in-the-us-and-other-faqs/articleshow/124069389.cms,"





What is the H-1B visa

Visa Chaos: Trump’s $100K H1-B Rule EXPLAINED; Who Pays & Who Escapes | WATCH

Who will be most affected by the H-1B fee hike

The sharp rise in fees will most directly affect new applicants and sponsoring companies, making the process prohibitively expensive.

Indian professionals, who account for nearly 70% of all H-1B holders, face the greatest burden. Many Indian tech workers rely on US employment as a pathway to higher salaries and green cards.

Chinese applicants also make up a large share, particularly in the fields of artificial intelligence, research, and STEM academia.

Tech giants like Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta can likely absorb the costs, but smaller firms and startups that depend on foreign talent may struggle, reducing opportunities for new graduates or niche specialists.

Educational institutions and hospitals that bring in foreign researchers, doctors, and nurses could also feel the strain, impacting healthcare and academia.

What does this mean for foreign workers

Why did the US raise the fees

Protect American workers by discouraging companies from hiring cheaper foreign labour.

Generate additional revenue for immigration enforcement and border security.

Discourage misuse of the H-1B system, which critics say some firms exploit to undercut wages.

Are there alternatives to the H-1B visa?





The United States has announced a steep increase in fees for H-1B visa applications, sparking concern among foreign workers, students, and tech companies alike. The cost for new visa petitions has been raised to USD 100,000, up from the previous range of roughly USD 2,000 to USD 5,000. The move, described by the Trump administration as a measure to “protect American jobs,” is expected to disproportionately affect Indian and Chinese applicants, who make up the majority of H-1B holders. While the White House insists the new fees apply primarily to fresh applicants, critics argue it will make the US less attractive to global talent at a time when other countries are actively competing for skilled professionals. The announcement has left many with questions about the future of the program.The H-1B visa is a non-immigrant visa that allows US companies to hire foreign professionals in specialised fields that require advanced knowledge or technical expertise. These roles often include software engineering, medicine, finance, biotechnology, and academic research. Tech firms have been the biggest beneficiaries of the programme, using it to attract engineers and coders from India and China.The programme operates on a lottery system due to its popularity, with an annual cap of 85,000 visas — 65,000 general and 20,000 reserved for applicants with advanced degrees from US institutions. For many international students graduating from American universities, the H-1B serves as a bridge to long-term employment and, eventually, permanent residency.For individuals aspiring to work in the US, the new fee structure presents a significant financial hurdle. Even if employers cover the fees, smaller firms may become reluctant to sponsor foreign workers, reducing the number of opportunities.This could lead to a brain drain away from the US, as highly skilled professionals may instead apply to countries like Canada, Australia, Germany, and the UK, which are actively expanding their skilled migration programmes. The move may also increase uncertainty for international students in the US, who often rely on the H-1B to remain in the country after completing their studies.The policy shift also raises concerns about equity in the job market, as it may favour wealthier applicants and companies while shutting out talent from modest backgrounds or resource-limited institutions.The Trump administration has framed the fee hike as part of its “America First” policy, designed to:However, opponents argue that the move is short-sighted and protectionist. They warn that while it may safeguard some American jobs in the short term, it risks damaging the country’s long-term competitiveness in innovation, research, and technology, as the US has historically relied on immigrant talent to drive growth in Silicon Valley and beyond.No. The new fee applies only to fresh applications, not renewals for existing visa holders.Yes. Large multinational firms are expected to absorb the fee, but small and medium-sized enterprises may struggle, potentially reducing sponsorship opportunities.At present, the hike is limited to H-1B visas, but the administration has hinted at the possibility of future reforms to other work visa categories.Yes. Skilled professionals may explore the O-1 visa (for individuals with extraordinary ability), employment-based green cards, or apply to other countries such as Canada and Australia, which have more accessible pathways for global talent.","The united states has announced a steep increase in fees for h-1b visa applications.
