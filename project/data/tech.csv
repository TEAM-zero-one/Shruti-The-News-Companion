Indian startup commissions world's first commercial space surveillance sat; SCOT captures image of South America,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-startup-commissions-worlds-first-commercial-space-surveillance-sat-scot-captures-image-of-south-america/articleshow/118811058.cms,"SCOT capturing the first image of the city of Buenos Aires in South America glowing against the planet's curvature.

New Delhi: The world's first commercial space surveillance satellite of an Indian startup, capable of tracking objects as small as 5 cm orbiting the Earth, was commissioned on Saturday as it captured images over South America.“Space just ran out of hiding spots,” Bengaluru start-up Digantara said in a post on X as its satellite SCOT (Space Camera for Object Tracking) started operations. Digantara had launched SCOT on Jan 14 aboard Elon Musk-owned SpaceX's Transporter-12 rocket.In a statement, the company said the SCOT satellite achieved first light on Saturday and its inaugural image while passing over South America — a breathtaking view of Earth's limb, with the city of Buenos Aires glowing against the planet's curvature.On the satellite’s first show, Digantara CEO Anirudh Sharma posted on X, “A Picture of Possibility, Future of Space based SSA. When we started, doubt was our first companion. Was it even possible for us to achieve what we had set out to do? Space doesn’t reward hesitation. It demands precision, resilience, and belief especially when the odds seem impossible. And yet, here we are. The first raw image from SCOT-1 clicked above South America!”The CEO further said, “SCOT's first image is more than a technical milestone; it's a symbol of our team's resilience and unwavering commitment to safeguarding Earth's orbits for generations to come.”Soon after the SCOT satellite launch in January, PM Narendra Modi had then congratulated the startup and posted on X, “Kudos to Indian space startup @Digantarahq on the success of Mission SCOT. This is an important contribution of the growing Indian space industry towards enhancing space situational awareness .”The satellite is designed to track and monitor objects as small as 5 cm, with a high revisit rate for frequent and precise observations of orbital activity. As space becomes more and more congested, this advanced capability is essential for mitigating collision risks and promoting sustainable space operations by providing accurate and dependable data to satellite operators and regulatory bodies.Former Isro chairman S Somanath congratulated “Digantarahq for making a dream come true. Having our own Space based SSA capability demonstrated by SCOT-1”.SCOT has been deployed in a sun-synchronous orbit that allows it to track objects in low earth orbit with more efficiency than existing sensors, which are restricted by fields of view, weather conditions and geographic limitations.","Digantara launched scot (space camera for object tracking) on jan 14 aboard spacex's transporter-12 rocket.

Vaishnaw: India's pragmatism will pay off amid global shifts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/vaishnaw-indias-pragmatism-will-pay-off-amid-global-shifts/articleshow/118810521.cms,"Mumbai: India's pragmatic approach of prioritising national interests over ideology in trade talks will ensure resilience amid geopolitical shifts , union minister Ashwini Vaishnaw said.At a fireside chat at the Economic Times Awards for Corporate Excellence, Vaishnaw said, ""India will emerge stronger from these geopolitical shifts due to our pragmatic approach. We are not ideologically driven but focused on what is best for the country"". On talks for a trade deal with US, he said that India will come out strong as the trade relationship with the U.S. is largely complementary. ""We conducted a study of all Harmonized System (HS) code lines and found significant synergies,"" he said.Vaishnaw urged industry leaders to invest in development of 25-30 products. ""For example, in consumer products such as mobile manufacturing, companies are designing and manufacturing capital goods domestically. Can IT firms invest in foundational AI models or develop our own mobile operating system? If industry takes one step forward, the govt will take ten steps to support them,"" he said.He laid out the agenda across the five key layers of AI-chips, foundational models, applications, data center & hyperscaler layer, and talent. By the end of the year, the country will have three indigenous AI models, while a domestically developed GPU is expected within the next three to four years. India has also launched a 14,000-GPU common compute facility, exceeding its initial target of 10,000 and ensuring wider access to AI resources through a public-private partnership. Unlike other regions where computing power is concentrated among a few players, India aims for inclusivity. ""The future of AI must be democratised, and India is leading the way,"" he said.Vaishnaw said the country was seeing a reversal of brain drain. ""Professionals like Dr. Randhir Thakur (Tata Electronics MD & CEO) have returned to lead our semiconductor initiatives. The startup ecosystem has transformed-India is now among the top three startup nations. A decade ago, startups were a rarity. Today, entrepreneurs take risks, and we see innovation thriving,"" he said. On climate protection, he said the country has already secured 4,000 megawatts of green power, with 7,000 megawatts in the pipeline. ""We are on track to meet our sustainability goals,"" he said.On the railways, Vaishnaw said the govt has invested Rs 1.14 lakh cr annually. ""Ten years ago, India recorded 171 railway accidents per year; today, that number has dropped to 30. While this is progress, we continue to improve,"" he said. The railways are integrating technology for track inspections, scheduling maintenance more efficiently, and working with startups to develop innovative solutions. The fourth version of the Kavach automatic train protection system was approved and certified and is being rolled out.Vaishnaw said India's railways have undergone a major transformation over the past decade, with 45,000 km of tracks electrified-more than twice the progress made in the first 60 years of independence. He noted that 34,000 km of new tracks have been laid, exceeding Germany's entire network, and that India now produces 1,500 locomotives annually.","Union minister ashwini vaishnaw spoke at the economic times awards for corporate excellence. He urged industry leaders to invest in development of 25-30 products.

"Government extends duty-free import of yellow peas till May, imposes 10% duty on lentils",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-extends-duty-free-import-of-yellow-peas-till-may-imposes-10-duty-on-lentils/articleshow/118808618.cms,"New Delhi: Govt has extended duty-free import of yellow peas by three months, until the end of May, while imposing a 10% duty on imports of lentils (masur), according to a revenue department notification issued on late Friday evening.India mostly imports yellow peas and lentils from Canada, Russia and Australia. Sources said govt’s moves aim at ensuring availability of pulses at affordable prices and send a positive signal to farmers as well.Govt had allowed the import of yellow peas at 0% duty in Dec 2023 to boost availability. This is used as a substitute for chana, and the prices are also much lower. The Centre had extended the free import multiple times amid prospects of lower chana output. In 2017, govt had imposed a 50% duty on import of yellow peas to encourage domestic production of chana.As per official data, the import of yellow peas was around 30 lakh tonnes out of the total import of 67 lakh tonnes of pulses in 2024. Despite being the biggest producer of pulses, India, to bridge the gap, depends on imports of about 15-18% to meet the annual pulses demand of around 290 lakh tonnes.The main reason behind free import of yellow peas is its price. While at present the landed cost of yellow peas is at around Rs 32-35 per kg, the retail price is around Rs 40 a kg. This is much cheaper compared to prices of all other pulses which are in the range of Rs 90-160 per kg.Govt continuing free import of yellow peas has stumped traders considering that mandi prices of chana in Maharashtra and Karnataka are less than the minimum support price (MSP) of Rs 5,650 a quintal for the 2024-25 marketing season.In the case of masur, govt had reduced the basic import duty to zero in July 2021 and subsequently, the exemption from 10% agri-infrastructure cess was given in Feb 2022. Since then, this was extended multiple times and was valid till March 2024.Sources said masur would now attract basic customs duty (5%) and agriculture infrastructure and development cess (5%).","Govt had allowed the import of yellow peas at 0% duty in dec 2023 to boost availability.

NEW DELHI: India on Friday inked a $248 million contract with Russia’s state-owned Rosoboronexport (RoE) for procurement of 1,000 HP (horsepower) engines for its fleet of T-72 Tanks in “fully formed, completely knocked down and semi knocked down” conditions.“The deal also includes transfer of technology (ToT) from M/s RoE to M/s Armoured Vehicles Nigam Limited (or the Heavy Vehicles Factory) at Avadi, Chennai, for integration and subsequent licensed production of engines to boost the `Make in India' initiative,” a defence ministry official said.“The Russian-origin T-72s are the mainstay of the Army tank fleet, which at present are fitted with a 780 HP engine. Equipping the fleet of T-72 Tanks with 1,000 HP engines will enhance the battlefield mobility and offensive capability of the Army,” he added.Along with a fleet of 2,400 T-72 tanks, the Army has so far inducted 1,300 T-90S `Bhishma’ tanks of the 1,657 being produced by the Heavy Vehicles Factory under licence from Russia.The Army force is now also inducting 118 indigenous Arjun Mark-1A tanks , with 14 major and 57 minor “upgrades” to enhance firepower, mobility, endurance and protection, ordered for Rs 7,523 crore in Sept 2021. These 118 `improved’ tanks will add to the first 124 Arjun tanks inducted well over a decade ago.Then, there are the 354 indigenous light tanks for high-altitude warfare to be inducted under Project Zorawar for around Rs 17,500 crore. The need for such tanks, each weighing less than 25 tonnes with a high power-to-weight ratio as well as superior firepower and protection, has been driven home by the continuing almost four-year-long military confrontation with China in eastern Ladakh.","India inked a $248 million contract with russia’s state-owned rosoboronexport (roe) for procurement of 1,000 hp (horsepower) engines for its fleet of t-72 tanks.

Kylie Kelce’s Strict Parenting Rule: Why Her Kids Are Banned from Phones



Kylie on Embarrassing Vegas Nights, Flip-Flop Aversions & Bikini Skiing with Chelsea Handler | Ep 12

Kylie Kelce , wife of former Philadelphia Eagles center Jason Kelce , has been making waves with her podcast Not Gonna Lie with Kylie Kelce, where she openly shares her experiences as a mother. With three daughters—Wyatt, Ellie, and Bennett—already part of the Kelce household and a fourth child on the way, Kylie has implemented a strict rule when it comes to technology: her children are not allowed to use or own phones.In the latest episode of her podcast, Kylie Kelce explained how she ensures her children grow up with a balanced approach to technology. While she does allow them to watch shows on tablets, smartphones are completely off-limits.“They are not allowed to touch phones,” Kylie stated. “That has been a rule from the very beginning. Occasionally, they will borrow someone’s phone and take pictures. Wyatt is really into taking selfies right now. Dad’s really thrilled about that one.”The Kelce household operates with a structured approach to screen time. Kylie admitted that while her daughters do watch content on tablets, she cleverly manages their usage. “I will pretend that I set a timer and I will tell them, ‘One more,’” she shared. “If my task that I was trying to complete is not finished, I will say, ‘You guys were so well behaved, I’ll let you watch one more.’”This strategy allows her to control their exposure while ensuring they remain engaged in other aspects of childhood beyond screens.Kylie has never shied away from discussing the real challenges of motherhood. On the January 23rd episode of her podcast, she described raising children as the “most selfless” and “all-encompassing” thing a person can do.""At any point in the day, you do have to always be concerned about the tiny humans you're responsible for, but I think there is a misconception that it wipes out the rest of you and makes you solely mom,"" Kylie explained.She further emphasized the importance of maintaining individuality while embracing motherhood. ""Whereas what we need to do is tack it on to the end of the resume and keep the rest of the s--- that also defines us as who we are as people because we're still us,"" she continued. ""Just because we made a human being or we are a mother to a tiny human doesn't mean that we are only mom.""Kylie Kelce’s Not Gonna Lie podcast has rapidly grown in popularity, reaching No. 1 on some platforms and amassing over 290,000 YouTube subscribers. Many of her episodes garner six-digit viewership, solidifying her presence in media.Meanwhile, Jason Kelce has also built a successful career post-football, co-hosting the New Heights podcast with his brother, Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce , as well as contributing to ESPN and other NFL coverage.Also Read: Caitlin Clark confidently names her all-time favorite NFL player – No second thoughts needed With their fourth child on the way, the Kelce household is about to get even busier.

A senior advisor at NASA who is part of Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative maintained a publicly accessible Google Calendar that revealed his connections to the programme and scheduled job interviews at companies including Tesla, Palantir and Anduril, a report has said.According to a report by Business Insider, 26-year-old Riley Sennott appears in an internal NASA directory as a “senior advisor” in the administrator's suite at headquarters and is also involved with DOGE.Apparently, unlike many DOGE workers who have deleted their LinkedIn profiles and made social media accounts private in recent months, Sennott failed to secure his Google Calendar, which was linked to his personal email address. Anyone with the address could view his appointments dating back to 2016, the report added.The publication claimed that the calendar contained entries, including a January 6 meeting titled ""Riley Sennott and DOGE Recruiting,"" which came from a Gmail address apparently used by DOGE for recruitment purposes, essentially providing rare insight into the group's hiring process, which has remained largely secretive despite advertising open positions.Another significant calendar entry from January 17 showed Sennott was scheduled to attend a ""SGE ethics discussion."" SGE reportedly stands for ""special government employee,"" a designation reportedly used for Elon Musk.Sennott's calendar suggests potential connections to Tesla, with several scheduled meetings with Tesla employees and references to “a rotating project-based role.” His private X account bio describes him as “energy @tesla.”The calendar also documented Sennott's apparent job search activities, including interviews with major tech firms throughout 2024.These included a scheduled Zoom call about a “venture role” with Founders Fund (an early SpaceX investor), a “recruiter call” with Peter Thiel's Palantir, an “Opportunity Chat” with defense technology company Anduril, and recent meetings with partners at venture capital firm Thrive Capital.","Recruitment details in doge, tesla may have been leaked.

The collection also contained an intimate snapshot of Meghan and Harry sharing a joyful embrace on the beach.The caption read: Celebrating the strong women around us & the girls with dreams who will become women with vision. Also thanking those who uplift us every day.'Despite mixed reviews of her new Netflix programme With Love , Meghan appears enthusiastic, announcing its second season renewal through a celebratory Instagram dance. Industry sources suggest the surrounding controversy influenced the decision for renewal.Responding to recent criticism, she acknowledged her learning process, admitting she makes mistakes, but emphasised that she is ""learning every day"" following the widespread backlash to her highly anticipated Netflix show.She said: 'Right now!

RIL share price : Reliance Industries (RIL) shares have experienced significant decline, dropping 25% from their peak of Rs 1,608.95 on BSE on July 8. Foreign institutional investors ' selling amid retail slowdown and weak refining margins has led to a Rs 5.4 lakh crore erosion in value. The stock's performance has lagged behind Nifty by 10% since January 2024, creating widespread negative sentiment, according to an ET report.Recent trading sessions show a 4% recovery in RIL shares, indicating possible value buying at lower levels. The sustainability of this recovery remains uncertain.Jefferies analysts consider current valuations excessively negative, pointing out that the market capitalisation suggests an enterprise value of $48 billion for RIL's retail division, substantially below the $106 billion valuation from its previous funding round. They anticipate 15% retail growth in FY26, supported by same-store sales growth and expansion.

RIL's O2C division continues to experience pressure from weak global refining margins and low petrochemical spreads.RIL's current valuation might present an opportunity, considering the extensive negative sentiment already reflected in prices. The company's underperformance compared to the Nifty indicates thorough pricing of adverse factors.

Infosys work from office rules: Infosys, the second-largest software services firm in India, has issued a directive on Wednesday requiring its technology staff to comply with the work from office for 10 days monthly mandate, aiming to increase on-campus attendance. Infosys has implemented a new attendance system via a mobile application that mandates employees to be physically present at their designated office locations for at least 10 days monthly. The system will not automatically approve work-from-home requests, according to a senior staff member who requested not to be named.A colleague mentioned this requirement is primarily driven by project needs rather than departmental demands.Department heads at the Bengaluru-based organisation sent emails to their team members, instructing them to restrict their work-from-home requests starting March 10, according to sources who spoke to ET.Also Read | How will Elon Musk-led DOGE’s slashing of federal spending impact Indian IT companies?

Donald Trump’s latest tariff threats have added volatility to global stock markets, with India emerging as a key player in the US president’s trade realignment strategy.India put a 9.5% tariff on US goods, while the US imposes just 3% on Indian products. As reciprocal tariffs loom, industries like automobiles, pharmaceuticals, textiles, and steel are at risk. Despite a short rally this week, the Nifty remains down 14% from its peak, with smallcaps in bear market territory. Over $15 billion has been pulled out by Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) in 2025 alone.Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) have maintained their selling trend in Indian equities this March, with total equity outflows reaching Rs 24,753 crore as of March 7, bringing the year-to-date total to Rs 1,37,354 crore in CY25, according to ET report.India is particularly vulnerable to tariff hikes, with key sectors facing significant threats. The Indian Rupee has weakened, and foreign investment is retreating due to concerns about a slowdown.Ross Maxwell, Global Strategy Operations Lead at VT Markets said that India’s automobile, pharmaceutical, textiles, and steel sectors could face severe impacts. However, India’s diplomatic approach—focused on trade negotiations and tariff rationalization—could help mitigate risks. YES Securities suggests reducing tariffs on US imports like steel and encouraging American companies like Tesla to enter India, which could serve as leverage against potential retaliatory tariffs.VK Vijayakumar, Chief Investment Strategist at Geojit Financial Services, explains that markets perceive Trump’s moves as temporary negotiations rather than long-term tariff impositions, acknowledging that sustained tariffs could hurt the US economy. In response, China and Germany have already implemented domestic stimulus measures to counterbalance the effects of Trump’s policies, adding another layer of complexity to the global economic landscapeThe pharmaceutical sector, which holds 35% of the US market, faces short-term challenges but may benefit in the long term due to India’s competitive advantage over China. Amisha Vora, Chairperson & MD of PL Group, emphasized that despite tariff concerns, India remains more competitive than China, which faces a 20% tariff. Sandip Sabharwal, a market expert, pointed out that large-cap pharma stocks like Sun Pharma and Lupin have already experienced sell-offs but remain well-positioned unless tariffs escalate significantly.Despite global uncertainties, Indian markets show resilience. Vinod Nair, Head of Research at Geojit Financial Services, noted that India’s markets have remained strong despite equity outflows from emerging markets.Amisha Vora sees the current dip as an investment opportunity. “With ongoing reforms and India’s demographic advantage, the market will likely perform better, even amidst trade wars,” Vora told ET suggesting a potential correction of 4-5% in the short term.","Donald trump's tariff threats have added volatility to global stock markets.

The demand for full-time remote work is also significantly higher among women.""A bunch of companies including TCS and Accenture offer flexible work options, while some like Meesho include hybrid work policies to promote better work-life balance.Govindraj M K, CHRO at Myntra, says, ""We provide additional flexibility through our MynVive: Myntra Ramp-back Programme, which offers new mothers and primary caregivers options offering extended flexibility, such as sabbatical leave for up to 24 weeks and the option to work at 50% capacity for three months post-maternity.""However, many companies are insisting on a strict return to office. Rituparna Chakraborty, co-founder TeamLease, cautions, ""The result will be that organisations that embrace AI to enable personalised learning, hybrid work and career paths, and flexible working will be able to attract and retain the best female talent.""As industries adapt to tech advancements, the demand for skills that align with innovation and adaptability has never been higher. As AI (artificial intelligence) and automation disrupt sectors, the workforce needs to be equipped with new tools to stay ahead of the curve. Yet, there is still a considerable gap in terms of availability, coverage, and quality.Nishchae Suri, MD-India, Cornerstone OnDemand, says, ""As AI continues to transform industries, investing in targeted upskilling programmes for women is essential to cultivate an inclusive, agile workforce.""Encouragingly, job opportunities for women in India have surged by 48% in 2025, with notable growth in emerging tech fields.However, to fully harness this potential, organisations must address persistent upskilling gaps. Chakraborty says, ""Most AI training programmes are not targeted at specific issues that women face, such as the lack of mentors in tech and biased skill tests. The attention should move to the development of career acceleration programmes that are available to all women, free from bias, and in line with their work preferences.""Flexible work models, structured career re-entry programmes, and targeted Learning & Development (L&D) and upskilling must anchor talent management for women employees, equipping them to navigate the future of work with resilience & agility.","India inc is striving to reimagine workplaces, championing inclusivity, diversity, and gender parity.
