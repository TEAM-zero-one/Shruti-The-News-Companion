Indian scientists submit detailed project report to develop new semiconductor material,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/indian-scientists-submit-detailed-project-report-to-develop-new-semiconductor-material/articleshow/120458831.cms,"NEW DELHI: A team of 30 scientists from India's premier institute, the Indian Institute of Science (IISc), has submitted a proposal to the government to develop 'angstrom-scale' chips, far smaller than the smallest chips currently in production. The team has submitted the proposal to the government for developing technologies using a new class of semiconductor materials , called 2D Materials , that could enable chip sizes as small as one-tenth of the smallest chips currently in global production and develop India's leadership in semiconductors.Currently, semiconductor manufacturing is dominated by silicon-based technologies, led by advanced nations such as the US, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan.""A team of scientists at IISc submitted a detailed project report (DPR) to the Principal Scientific Adviser (PSA) in April 2022, which was revised and submitted again in October 2024. The report was later shared with the Ministry of Electronics and IT. The project promises to develop angstrom-scale chips , far smaller than the smallest chips in production today,"" a source in the government familiar with the proposal told PTI.The DPR proposes the development of 2D semiconductors using ultra-thin materials like graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). These materials can enable chip fabrication at the angstrom scale, significantly smaller than current nanometer-scale technologies.The smallest chip currently in production is the 3-nanometer node, manufactured by companies like Samsung and MediaTek.A brief summary of the 2D materials project -- which aims to replace silicon, is available on the website of the PSA's office.Sources in the Ministry of Electronics and IT (MeitY) confirmed that the proposal has been under discussion.""MeitY is positive about the project. The Principal Scientific Adviser and Secretary, MeitY, have held meetings on it. MeitY is exploring the electronics applications where such technology can be deployed. This is a collaborative effort that requires due diligence at every step,"" an official aware of the matter said.India currently relies heavily on foreign players for semiconductor manufacturing -- a technology that is strategic from both an economic and national security standpoint.The country's largest semiconductor project, being set up by Tata Electronics in partnership with Taiwan's PSMC, involves an investment of Rs 91,000 crore. This project has been approved under the India Semiconductor Mission and is eligible for 50 per cent capital support from the government.In comparison, the IISc-led proposal requests a relatively modest Rs 500 crore over five years to build indigenous technology for next- generation semiconductors. The project also includes a roadmap for self-sustainability after the initial funding phase.Globally, 2D materials have drawn significant interest. Europe has invested over USD 1 billion (around Rs 8,300 crore), South Korea over USD 300 million, and countries like China and Japan have made serious but undisclosed investments in 2D material-based semiconductor research.""2D materials will be key enablers for future heterogeneous systems. While global momentum is building, India's efforts remain limited and need urgent scaling. This is a domain where India can take leadership, but time is running out,"" said an officer familiar with the efforts and global developments, speaking on condition of anonymity.According to the PSA office website, communications regarding the project have been ongoing since 2021, with outreach to key ministries including MeitY, DRDO, and the Department of Space. NITI Aayog also recommended the project in September 2022 based on the IISc report.The officer privy to the research ecosystem noted that several countries are already preparing for a post-silicon world as traditional chip scaling nears its limits.""Global technology players have turned their attention to 2D semiconductors. India now needs to move from deliberation to execution. The proposal seeks Rs 500 crore over five years, but there is still no formal assurance. This window may not stay open for long,"" the person added.","A team of 30 scientists from india's premier institute, the indian institute of science (iisc), has submitted a proposal to the government to develop 'angstrom-scale' chips.

What Barack-Michelle said about rumors of their divorce



Barack Obama-Michelle marriage crisis is far from finishing its shelf life as people can't stop talking about it. And the main reason for it is that Barack and Michelle can't stop talking about their marriage either. Michelle has addressed her marriage in her new podcast IMO, with her co-host and older brother Craig Robinson.Megyn Kelly , in the latest episode of her podcast, spoke about what Michelle and Barack have been saying about each other and concluded that they married the wrong people. ""I’ve been married for 17-and-a-half years and not one was bad. I think she and he married the wrong people. Every word she says about Barack Obama is negative… Every time she opines, it’s something that reflects poorly on him – how he’s insensitive, how he’s not a talker, how he doesn’t know how to relate to people, he doesn’t keep the same schedule as she does. And now we’re talking about how you can have a bad decade in a marriage,"" Megyn said.Megyn Kelly fails to mention she's been married twice, Mike Sington wrote on X taking a swipe at Megyn.The rumors of an impending divorce of Barack Obama and Michelle were so intense that Barack Obama was even linked with actor Jennifer Aniston, when Michelle Obama missed several public events where a former first lady is expected to accompany her husband.Barack Obama opened up about his relationship with Michelle and recently revealed that he was in a ""deep deficit"" with Michelle after leaving office and he's still trying to make up to her. “I have been trying to dig myself out of that hole by doing occasionally fun things,” he said.Michelle Obama commented on Barack's solo appearances and said she now has the opportunity to control her own calendar and can now make “a choice for myself.”“I could have made a lot of these decisions years ago, but I didn’t give myself that freedom,” she said. “And now that’s gone. And so now I have to look at my — I get to look at my calendar, which I did this year, was a real big example of me, myself looking at something that I was supposed to do — you know, without naming names — and I chose to do what was best for me, not what I had to do, not what I thought other people wanted me to do.”“That’s the thing that we as women, I think we struggle with like disappointing people,” Michelle continued. “I mean so much so that this year people were, you know — they couldn’t even fathom that I was making a choice for myself that they had to assume that my husband and I are divorcing.”","Megyn kelly said she thinks barack and michelle obama married the wrong persons.

"Tech layoffs in 2025: Google, Microsoft, Meta, and other tech giants cut jobs amid restructuring",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tech-layoffs-in-2025-google-microsoft-meta-and-other-tech-giants-cut-jobs-amid-restructuring/articleshow/120338671.cms,"Google, Microsoft, Meta, and other tech giants cut jobs amid restructuring

Google, Meta, Microsoft among top tech firms slashing jobs in 2025

Google: Streamlining amid structural shifts

Microsoft: Organizational restructuring expected in May

Meta: Performance-based layoffs and executive bonus backlash

TikTok: Job reductions in Dublin office

The technology sector is undergoing yet another wave of workforce reductions in 2025, following an already turbulent 2024 marked by widespread layoffs. As companies shift their focus to automation, artificial intelligence, and cost-efficiency, job cuts are becoming a recurring theme across some of the industry's biggest players. According to data from layoff tracking platform Trueup, 234 layoffs have already been recorded in the tech industry this year, affecting 45,656 employees—an average of 439 job losses per day.For comparison, 2024 saw a total of 1,115 layoff incidents with a staggering 238,461 workers affected, translating to an average of 653 daily dismissals. The job cuts reflect a strategic realignment aimed at optimizing resource allocation and enhancing profitability, particularly in high-growth segments such as AI and cloud computing.Google has been among the most active in workforce restructuring, entering its third round of layoffs in 2025. This latest reduction targets several hundred employees within its Platforms & Devices unit, which encompasses key products including Android, Pixel smartphones, and the Chrome web browser.Earlier in the year, Google initiated a “voluntary exit” program specifically for U.S.-based employees in the same division. This followed a 2024 internal reorganization that merged Android and Pixel teams to consolidate operations. The company also reduced headcount in its cloud division in February 2025. A Google spokesperson stated that the actions were necessary “to continue to invest in areas that are critical to our business and ensure our long-term success.”Microsoft is reportedly preparing for another round of layoffs expected to take place as early as May 2025. While official numbers have not been disclosed, internal restructuring is likely to target middle management layers. The company's ongoing objective is to increase the ratio of technical personnel, especially engineers, across all business units.Within Microsoft’s security division, for instance, leadership aims to shift the engineer-to-project manager ratio from 5.5:1 to a leaner 10:1. Performance evaluations are playing a significant role in the decision-making process, and employees with consistently low performance ratings may face termination as part of the streamlining efforts.In February 2025, Meta laid off approximately 3,600 employees, representing nearly 5% of its global workforce. The layoffs were primarily attributed to internal performance evaluations and are consistent with CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s stated vision of transforming Meta into a more efficient and agile organization.However, the timing of the layoffs attracted criticism after the company announced sizable bonus allocations for senior executives shortly afterward. This has sparked debate about compensation disparities and employee morale, especially as many mid- and entry-level workers were affected by the cuts.TikTok has joined the list of tech companies implementing layoffs this year, with around 300 jobs expected to be eliminated at its Dublin office. While the final number is yet to be confirmed, the redundancies are anticipated to take place in April 2025.This move follows a broader trend of workforce optimization across the technology sector, raising concerns among employees in Europe and beyond about job security. The reduction also underscores the challenges facing social media companies amid shifting regulatory environments and growing operational costs.","Google, microsoft, meta, and other tech giants cut jobs amid restructuring.

Tesla stocks declined 33% year-to-date

Tesla investor Ross Gerber, who publicly called for Elon Musk’s exit from the EV company, has once again criticised him. In an interview with Bloomberg Technology, the CEO of Gerber Kawasaki Wealth & Investment Management, said that Musk “doesn’t care” about the electric car manufacturer. He went on to claim that the tech billionaire Elon Musk is not returning 'his focus' to Tesla anytime soon. He has found his next Big Focus and that it is not Tesla. “It’s clear that he just doesn’t care. His next move is X AI… So if you have any confusion that he’s coming back to Tesla, he’s not,” he said during the interview. In March, Gerber said that Musk has lost focus given his widening interests and has become too ‘divisive’. Blaming social media posts and involvement with the president Donald Trump for bringing negative publicity to the company, he then said that “the company's reputation has just been destroyed by Elon Musk”.He then stated that Musk would need to choose between backing Trump and safeguarding Tesla. He said : “It's time for somebody to run Tesla. The business has been neglected for too long. There are too many important things Tesla is doing, so either Elon should come back to Tesla and be the CEO of Tesla and give up his other jobs or he should focus on the government and keep doing what he is doing but find a suitable CEO of Tesla.”In his Bloomberg interview, Gerber defended his Tesla comments, responding to the criticism from retail investors. He said “I understand why retail investors at Tesla are frustrated with me for voicing my views” adding that he’s “getting attacked because of Elon’s behavior.”However, Gerber said that his firm will continue to manage Tesla shares. He said “We still own Tesla because I do think something fixes itself at some point, and they have the best products”.Despite maintaining its lead in the US EV market, Tesla's stock has dropped 33% year-to-date. According to Cox Automotive data, Tesla sales fell 8.6% year over year in the first quarter of 2025, while the market expanded 11.4% as a whole. Meanwhile, the EV company is set to announce its first-quarter earnings on Tuesday, April 22.Stock market worldwide has been volatile amidst the US-China tariff trade war. In a latest, Trump announced a sweeping 245% retaliatory tariff on Chinese imports.","Ross gerber, ceo of gerber kawasaki wealth & investment management, said that musk ‘doesn’t care’ about the electric car manufacturer.

The billboard featured Bezos alongside pop star Katy Perry with a caption that read: ""If you can send Katy Perry to space, you can afford to pay more taxes.""The ad appeared days after Blue Origin — Bezos’ space venture — successfully launched its 11th human spaceflight from West Texas, featuring an all-female crew. The team included Perry, journalist Gayle King, Bezos’ fiancée Lauren Sánchez, former Nasa engineer Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, and producer Keri Flynn. The suborbital flight crossed the Kármán line and lasted around 10 minutes.""You're brave, you're bold… No limitations,"" Perry said ahead of the launch, adding she drew inspiration from astrophysics readings and her role as a mother. “Being a mother just makes you level up with that type of power,” she noted.While Blue Origin celebrated the flight as a historic milestone for women in space , the trip drew criticism online, with some pointing to the juxtaposition of extravagant space missions and tax avoidance claims. One viral post read, “We are literally just asking them to pay their fair share of taxes, which they don’t.”Others, however, defended Bezos.

Desi deeptech funding up 78% in 2024: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/desi-deeptech-funding-up-78-in-2024-report/articleshow/120463987.cms,"AI-generated image

BENGALURU: India's deeptech ecosystem - comprising startups in AI, spacetech , advanced manufacturing, and semiconductor design - added over 480 new ventures in 2023, up two times the previous year. The cumulative base now stands close to 4,000.In 2024, the sector experienced a remarkable surge in funding, with investments rising by 78% compared to the previous year. The sector's expansion was fuelled by supportive govt policies, rapid advancements in generative AI and breakthrough innovations from emerging companies, says a report by Nasscom and Zinnov.The report says top 10 deeptech startup funding rounds in 2024 accounted for about $600 million of total deeptech funding , which stood at $1.6 billion. Of these top 10, all but one were AI-powered software platforms solving for different use cases.These deeptech startups not only attracted more funding but also commanded higher investor confidence, with median ticket sizes matching or surpassing those of traditional tech startups.Yet, founders and investors warn that India risks squandering this momentum unless ecosystem matures beyond early-stage support and builds robust demand, capital continuity, and meaningful exit pathways.""The best way to ensure Rs 10,000 crore reaches the right builders is to ally with the right venture capital funds who have a good track record,"" said Kaushik Mudda, cofounder of Ethereal Machines, a Bengaluru-based startup that builds CNC machines critical to precision manufacturing. ""Most funds or venture capitalists either try to rely on market reports and studies or western models that have worked to make investment decisions instead of spending time understanding underlying technologies. ""Mudda sees govt's current push as a ""real policy pivot,"" one that signals long-term national ambition. But deeptech startups face a fundamental challenge - revenue often comes after years of R&D, and capital needs are front-loaded. ""We've managed by being extremely frugal,"" Mudda said. ""Now I see a lot more startups having benefit of raising larger rounds in deeptech, I hope funds are then used wisely before revenue kicks in. ""Some founders argue that the bigger bottleneck lies in the lack of domestic market depth. Saurabh Chandra, founder of Ati Motors, a startup building autonomous industrial vehicles, said the lack of a domestic market also increases the capital requirements for a startup since global markets are the only viable option. ""This is the route we have also taken,"" he said.","India's deeptech ecosystem added over 480 new ventures in 2023, up two times the previous year. The cumulative base now stands close to 4,000.

"Bira 91 faces employee woes, supply strain",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bira-faces-staff-unrest-over-dues/articleshow/120463994.cms,"BENGALURU: Craft beer maker Bira 91 is experiencing increased unrest among both current and former employees, who have cited issues such as pending salaries, unreimbursed allowances, and unresolved dues. These concerns linger months after the company began a restructuring exercise that was never officially labelled a layoff.A former sales employee reported, “I was told to serve a two-month notice after resigning in December, but in January, it was suddenly cut short by a month. They promised to clear my dues, but I’ve been waiting 90 days now. The latest update says it may come by May 31.”Multiple employees informed TOI that salary delays began in November 2024, with reimbursements for travel and daily expenses halted around the same period. In January 2025, several staff members were either reassigned to different cities or instructed to switch roles. A former employee stated, “I was in marketing and told to move into sales in another state. This was the case for 70% of us. Those who didn’t accept were told to resign. ”Internally, the workforce reported a continued decline in the company’s financial health since last year. A former marketing executive highlighted a considerable discrepancy between expected and achieved results.“In 2023, Bira aimed for ambitious sales targets but ended up doing only 40% of it. Hiring and spending were based on much higher growth expectations. It became unsustainable.”The same employee noted significant marketing outlays, with an estimated Rs 200-250 crore spent on a five-year ICC sponsorship concluding in 2023, along with multiple IPL team partnerships. “We created demand with ATL and BTL campaigns, but there was no stock on shelves. Vendors weren’t paid, raw material didn’t arrive, and breweries stopped operating. The Rs 80 crore loss blamed on labelling was just a cover.” Bira 91 did not respond to TOI’s request for comment.The company changed its legal name in 2023, necessitating product relabelling across various states. This coincided with delayed payments to vendors and an inventory shortage during the summer. Employees reported that operational disturbance extended into the peak beer season. Industry observers attribute these challenges to overextension. Vinod Giri, Director General of the Brewers Association of India, commented, “New brands hoping to disrupt beer must walk a fine line between growth and uniqueness. Expanding too fast with the wrong state mix or unused capacity can quickly become unsustainable.”Sanjay Jain, an alcobev market observer and founding partner at Taj Capital, added, “Beer is a volume game. Bira had a strong niche identity but pivoted too quickly to scale. Venture capital often misreads the unit economics of beer – it’s not FMCG.”Bira 91, founded in 2015, secured approximately $457 million from investors such as Sofina, Kirin Holdings, MUFG Bank, and Peak XV Partners. The most recent funding round of $25 million closed last year. The company's revenue fell 22% to Rs 638 crore in the 2023-24 financial year, while net losses widened to Rs 748 crore, partly due to an inventory write-off linked to the labelling transition","Craft beer maker bira 91 is experiencing increased unrest among both current and former employees.

"Cos: Healthy rains, lower inflation to boost spends",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/cos-healthy-rains-lower-inflation-to-boost-spends/articleshow/120463972.cms,"MUMBAI/NEW DELHI: Predictions of a healthy monsoon and easing retail inflation will spur demand in consumer segments, such as FMCG, two-wheelers, cars and tractors as the crucial rural economy will gain strength, while positivity spills over to the broader economy and urban centres, company executives and experts say.The upbeat mood builds up even as the industry remains cautious of the outcome of India's trade talks with the Trump administration, which - if successful - will be an added impetus to growth.Sluggish spending over past few quarters has weighed in on consumer businesses. Even as rural purchases have stayed steady, consumer goods companies and retailers struggled with slow demand in urban areas, where lower middle-class cut discretionary spends over inflationary concerns.""The last two quarters have seen significant slowdown, impacting consumption, owing to overall inflation as well as other macro-economic factors. With ease of retail inflation, coupled with direct tax reforms in this year's budget, we expect increased middle-class spending and recovery in urban demand from third quarter (July-Sept) onwards,"" says Manish Anandani, MD at Kenvue that makes products like Johnson's Baby and Listerine.The farm sector is particularly hopeful on rains. ""A normal monsoon has always been very positive for the agri economy and for tractors. The latest forecast from both IMD and Skymet is very encouraging. We look forward to the upcoming Kharif season,"" says Hemant Sikka, president of farm equipment sector at Mahindra & Mahindra, the country's biggest tractor seller.Raman Mittal, joint MD at International Tractors (Sonalika Group), says that timely arrival of monsoons and its intensity plays a pivotal role in uplifting farm sentiments over strong harvest and improved cash flows. ""FY25 saw record production in both Kharif and Rabi seasons, driving tractor sales in the second half, with full-year sales growing by double digits. With El Nino unlikely to return in 2026, strong rural demand, combined with favourable seasonal rains, should accelerate tractor sales and energise allied agricultural activities. ""Kumar Rajagopalan, CEO at Retailers Association of India (RAI) hopes that low inflation can boost consumption, which grew at a milder 4-5% pace last year. ""The tariff war is a worry as there's no certainty about how things will unfold, although India seems to be in a better position as of now.""Mayank Shah, VP at Parle Products, says good monsoons should continue to support rural demand, besides boosting crop output that eventually will help keep input prices stable and domestic inflation under check. Shah expects the foods segment to see a 12-13% growth this year ""if the macro environment remains stable"".Zydus Wellness expects growth in its food, nutrition and personal care categories to pick up on the back of easing inflation and estimates of good monsoons. ""With moderating food prices, household purchasing power is expected to improve significantly, particularly in rural India where farm incomes have risen by 5% annually over the past decade and could rise more this season,"" Rachit Vohra, senior director (sales) at Kellanova India, says.Hemal N Thakkar, senior practice leader and director at Crisil Intelligence, says he expects ""the momentum to continue"" for the domestic tractor as well as two-wheeler industry, which posted healthy growth last fiscal. ""This is on account of healthy rabi cash flows as well as the tax relief for income up to Rs 12 lakh. With the prediction of normal monsoons, the sentiments would definitely be positive and we may end FY26 at lower single-digit growth for tractors and a 7-9% growth for 2Ws in terms of domestic sales.

D-St seeks F&O trading test instead of tighter Sebi rules,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/d-st-seeks-fo-trading-test-instead-of-tighter-sebi-rules/articleshow/120463941.cms,"MUMBAI: Sebi has received suggestions from industry experts that the markets regulator introduce tests for investors before being allowed to trade in risky derivative products to safeguard them. Similar systems are in practice in Singapore, Hong Kong, the EU.The proposals were sent to Sebi after the regulator last month published a consultation paper on proposed changes to rules for trading in the equity F&O segment of the market. April 17 was the last day to send comments on those proposals.The reasoning here is that, rather than targeting the whole industry with stricter rules to protect retail investors, Sebi could, with the right training, make it safer for them to get into risky futures & options (F&O) products, sources said.One of the main concerns of the commentators on the paper was that while the proposals could protect retail investors, they could lead to a concentration of trading in a very limited number of exchanges. The proposals could potentially stifle product innovations in the exchange place, sources said.The markets regulator also received views that said limiting F&O expiry to just one or two days of the week could multiply volatility during the days closer to the expiry days.This could also enhance the need to deploy expensive computing powers for risk management during those closing days of the contracts. In addition, such a move could stifle competition if an upcoming exchange wants to enter the space but is unable to spend a huge amount to deploy such expensive hardware.According to financial services consultancy firm MCQube's Mrugank Paranjape, the proposal to limit contract expiry to either Tuesday or Thursday of the week could shift volumes to one exchange on the expiry day and thus could stifle competition. Paranjape also said that the proposal to shift all the contract expiry to the last day of the week could produce large market-wide risk.O n the proposal to restrict only one weekly benchmark index options contract per exchange, some of the commentators have said that such a move could restrict product diversity in a market that hosts a variety of actively traded indices like Nifty, the sensex, Bank Nifty, and BSE 100.Each of these indices serves different investor segments and strategies. So, such a restriction to one contract could stifle innovation and compel traders to concentrate on fewer instruments, which could increase risk, contrary to the policy's intention, a source said.","Sebi has received suggestions from industry experts that the markets regulator introduce tests for investors before being allowed to trade in risky derivative products.

Opening for Chinese tech giants

Strategic concerns

As the Trump administration escalates its efforts to restrict semiconductor exports to China, industry experts warn that the move could have unintended consequences, namely, accelerating China’s domestic chip innovation and eroding US dominance in the global semiconductor market , AFP reported.The latest restrictions require US chipmakers like Nvidia and AMD to obtain licenses before exporting high-performance processors to China, over concerns they could be used in military or supercomputing applications.But analysts say this pressure might push Chinese companies to become more self-reliant—and more competitive.“What’s actually happening is that the US government right now is handing China a big win as it tries to get their own chip business going,” said Jack Gold, principal analyst at J Gold Associates. “Once they’re competitive, they’ll start selling around the world and people will buy their chips.”In regulatory filings this week, Nvidia said the licensing requirements could cost the company up to $5.5 billion (Rs 45,870 crore) in lost sales. AMD estimates a potential revenue hit of $800 million (Rs 6,672 crore) due to the export restrictions.Nvidia had developed its H20 chip specifically for the Chinese market, carefully optimizing performance while staying within earlier US trade rules.Now, those chips require government approval before being shipped.AMD faces similar hurdles with its MI308 GPU line, designed for AI and gaming applications. The company stated there is ""no guarantee"" licenses will be granted.Experts believe the restrictions are creating a major opportunity for Chinese firms like Huawei to accelerate efforts to dominate the chip landscape.“It’s going to be a godsend for China as they spin up their own microprocessor business ,” said independent tech analyst Rob Enderle. “This will be a really quick way to hand over US leadership in microprocessors and GPUs.”China, which already invests heavily in its chip sector, is likely to increase spending and policy support to close the technology gap.“The worldwide economy is not like that,” Gold said, pointing to Trump’s aggressive trade policies. “You can’t just bully people. These tariffs are alienating allies, and they might start turning to China for chips instead.”Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has tried to downplay the impact, saying the company will remain compliant while continuing to push technological boundaries. But some analysts see the situation as part of a larger geopolitical struggle.“The Trump administration knows there is one chip and company fueling the AI revolution and it’s Nvidia,” said Wedbush analyst Dan Ives. “So it placed a ‘Do Not Enter’ sign in front of China.”Ives warned that the conflict is far from over. “We expect more punches to be thrown by both sides,” he said.As US firms brace for export losses, the race to build the next generation of semiconductors is entering a new, uncertain phase—one where China may gain speed rather than slow down.",Us chipmakers like nvidia and amd to obtain licenses before exporting high-performance processors to china.

A push for reshoring American manufacturing

As the Trump administration doubles down on tariffs to shift global trade dynamics, small US manufacturers are divided — some see opportunity, while others warn that unpredictability may outweigh any potential gain.Drew Greenblatt, president of Marlin Steel Wire Products in Baltimore, is among the strongest supporters. His company, which employs 115 workers across three states, makes wire baskets and racks for the aerospace, medical, and food processing sectors — all using American-sourced steel, as reported news agency AP.Greenblatt argues that his company faces steep competition from foreign producers benefiting from long-standing trade advantages. In particular, he says European tariffs make it far costlier for German customers to buy US products than for Americans to buy imports from Europe.“It’s wildly unfair to the American worker,” Greenblatt said. “And this has, by the way, been going on for decades.”The Trump administration has labelled US manufacturing a national security and economic priority, aiming to reverse decades of decline. According to the Bureau of Labour Statistics, manufacturing employment in the US peaked at 19.6 million workers in 1979.By early 2025, that number had dropped to 12.8 million — a 35% decline — with small manufacturers, who make up 99% of the sector, bearing much of the impact.Tariffs, the administration argues, will incentivize more domestic production and lead to better-paying jobs for Americans in sectors like automotive, electronics, and household goods. Greenblatt is hopeful — he says achieving tariff parity with other countries could allow his company to double its workforce.However, not all small business owners are convinced. For many, economic uncertainty sparked by the tariff policies is creating hesitation and anxiety.Corry Blanc, founder of Blanc Creatives in Waynesboro, Virginia, manufactures artisanal cookware using American steel and wood. While he supports domestic manufacturing, Blanc is concerned about the unpredictable nature of the current trade landscape.“There’s so much uncertainty and not a lot of direction,” he said, adding that his international customers are expressing concern. His company, which employs 12 staff members, lacks the infrastructure to suddenly ramp up production if demand increases.Michael Lyons, owner of Rogue Industries in Maine, which makes leather wallets and accessories, echoed similar worries. His company uses domestically sourced leather and produces 80% of its goods in the US Despite this, he recently lost a long-time Canadian client due to cross-border trade tensions.“Hopefully this will pass, and he’ll be able to come back,” Lyons said. “But it’s a real indicator of the friction these policies are causing.”For now, Lyons has shelved expansion plans, saying, “It’s probably going to be, we hold with what we have.”Still, some entrepreneurs believe the tariffs could help reignite American industry. Bayard Winthrop, CEO of American Giant, a US-based clothing brand, says the country’s aggressive embrace of globalization over the past 40 years decimated domestic textile production.In 1991, 56% of US apparel was made domestically. By 2023, that figure had plunged to below 4%, according to the American Apparel and Footwear Association.Winthrop sources cotton from states like Georgia and North Carolina and manufactures his products in Los Angeles and North Carolina. He sees the current trade approach as a long-overdue effort to rebalance unfair trade with countries like China.“The imbalances in textiles, especially with China, are shocking,” he said. “This could finally give domestic manufacturers a fighting chance.”Winthrop acknowledges concerns about the Trump administration’s unpredictable policymaking, but urges Americans to focus on the long-term vision.“The idea that we’re going to be more protective of our domestic marketplace and have an industrial policy that includes manufacturing jobs is not new,” he said. “It’s an old idea — and it’s one worth revisiting.”","The trump administration has labelled us manufacturing a national security and economic priority, aiming to reverse decades of decline.
