'One Who Fools People The Best Can Be The Best Leader': Nitin Gadkari's Leadership 'Truth' Shocker

NEW DELHI: Days after the Supreme Court rejected a PIL challenging the nationwide rollout of 20% ethanol-blended (E20) petrol, road transport & highways minister Nitin Gadkari on Wednesday blamed the “petrol lobby” and other “interests” behind the social media stories against blending.""Everywhere there are lobbies, there are interests... petrol lobby is very rich,"" he said when asked about the spate of social media posts where consumers could be seen complaining about the reduction of mileage and damage to the engines of older vehicles due to the E20 fuel.Speaking at the Auto Retail Conclave organized by the Federation of Automobile Dealers Associations (FADA), Gadkari said that ethanol—produced from sugarcane, broken rice, and other agricultural products—is expected to help reduce India's dependence on foreign oil.The country is spending Rs 22 lakh crore for importing fossil fuels, which are also leading to ""problems of pollution"" across cities, the minister added.He said companies are manufacturing electric cars, buses, and trucks in India as they are very cost-effective. ""The cost of lithium-ion batteries is also reducing. In due course of time, the price of petrol, diesel, and electric vehicles will be the same.""The minister also said the manufacturing capacity of electric buses in India is 50,000-60,000 units per year, against a requirement for nearly one lakh units annually.""We need to increase the production of electric buses... There is a huge market for exports also. This is the opportunity for electric vehicle companies.""The minister also said the transport ministry is working to encourage the use of flex-fuel engines in agricultural equipment vehicles.On the growth potential of the passenger vehicle market, he said the government aims to make the Indian market the top seller in the world within five years.""Within five years, our target is to make India's automobile industry number 1 in the world... it is difficult, but not impossible,"" he said, adding that the quality of vehicles manufactured in India is good while production costs are low compared to other countries.""When I took charge as transport minister, the size of the Indian automobile industry was Rs 14 lakh crore. The size now is Rs 22 lakh crore,"" Gadkari said, adding that at Rs 78 lakh crore, the US is the biggest market globally, followed by China (Rs 47 lakh crore).","Road transport & highways minister nitin gadkari blamed the “petrol lobby’ and other “interests” behind the social media stories against blending. ""everywhere there are lobbies, there are interests... petrol lobby is very rich,"" he said when asked about the spate of social media posts.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123811062,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-818266,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
"Tweak law to deal with fake news, says Parliamentary panel",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/tweak-law-to-deal-with-fake-news-says-parliamentary-panel/articleshow/123819698.cms,"1

NEW DELHI: Calling fake news a ""serious threat"" to public order and democratic process, a parliamentary panel has recommended amending penal provisions, increasing fines and fixing accountability to deal with the issue.In its draft report adopted Tuesday, Standing Committee on Communications and Information Technology, headed by BJP MP Nishikant Dubey, called for a mandatory fact-checking mechanism and internal ombudsman in all print, digital and electronic media organisations.The report is likely to be presented in the Parliament during the Winter Session.The committee, sources said, adopted the report unanimously, indicating cross-party support for stronger measures against fake news. It stressed that steps should be taken while ""maintaining the delicate balance of combating misinformation and protecting freedom of speech and individual rights as guaranteed under the Constitution.""Sharing a screenshot of a YouTube report that falsely claimed many BJP MPs were ""not reachable"" ahead of the vice-presidential poll, Dubey confirmed the panel had submitted its report to LS Speaker Om Birla. ""We will not allow India to become like Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, or Thailand.A curb will be placed on elements that mislead by following agendas of anti-national forces. Any news must be factual,"" he wrote.The panel suggested collaborative efforts among govt, private entities and independent fact-checkers to tackle fake news. It said the ministry of information and broadcasting should ensure that fact-checking mechanisms and ombudsmen are mandatory across media outlets. The draft report also addresses the ministry of electronics and information technology, which the panel scrutinises.Holding that editors and content heads should be accountable for editorial lapses, owners and publishers for institutional failures, and intermediaries and platforms for peddling fake news, it underlined the need for amending penal provisions in existing Acts and rules to crack down on publication and broadcast of false information.Flagging fake news with cross-border links, the committee recommended inter-ministerial collaboration at the national level and multilateral cooperation with international bodies. It suggested that the govt emulate best practices, such as the French law on election misinformation, and constitute a small but dedicated Inter-Ministerial Task Force to deal with cross-border misinformation, with representatives from the ministries of information and broadcasting, external affairs, electronics and IT, besides legal experts.On AI-generated misinformation, the panel urged close coordination among ministries to develop legal and technological solutions for identifying and prosecuting offenders. It recommended exploring licensing requirements for AI content creators, mandatory labelling of AI-generated videos and content, and apprising them of actions taken. AI tools, it said, should also be leveraged to detect fake content.The committee further called for a concrete time-bound grievance redressal framework and a digital tracking system for complaints.","A parliamentary panel has recommended amending penal provisions, increasing fines and fixing accountability to deal with the issue.

Tejasvi’s vision: Helping seniors navigate the internet safely and confidently

In February 2024, 16-year-old Tejasvi Manoj from Frisco, Texas, faced an experience that would inspire her to protect seniors from online scams. While driving home from Scouting America camp with her father, she discovered that her 85-year-old grandfather had received a seemingly urgent email from a relative requesting $2,000 to cover an unexpected debt. Ready to comply, he was fortunately stopped by her father’s intervention. A quick phone call to the supposed relative confirmed the request was fraudulent. Witnessing how easily older adults can fall victim to digital scams, Tejasvi was motivated to research the growing threat of cybercrime targeting seniors and eventually develop Shield Seniors, a platform dedicated to educating and safeguarding older adults online.Tejasvi Manoj is a high school student, accomplished coder, and founder of Shield Seniors, a cybersecurity platform aimed at educating and protecting older adults from online scams. Beyond her technological expertise, she is deeply involved in community service: earning her Eagle Scout rank, volunteering with the North Texas Food Bank Young Advocates Council, tutoring Bhutanese refugees, and performing in her school orchestra.Her parents, both IT professionals, nurtured her early interest in technology. By eighth grade, Tejasvi was fluent in programming languages including Java, Python, and HTML, and actively participated in cybersecurity initiatives like Girls Who Code and Cyber-Patriot. These experiences equipped her to address a pressing social issue using technology.Seniors represent a particularly target-rich demographic for cybercriminals. According to the FBI’s Internet Crime Complaint Center, nearly 860,000 reports of online scams were filed in 2024, resulting in potential losses exceeding $16 billion. Fraud directed at individuals over 60 accounted for $5 billion, a 32% increase from the previous year.The Federal Trade Commission reports that losses exceeding $10,000 among older adults quadrupled from 2020 to 2024, while losses over $100,000 increased sevenfold. This alarming trend underscores the urgency for effective solutions to safeguard retirees, pensioners, and seniors from financial exploitation online.Motivated by her grandfather’s experience, Tejasvi developed Shield Seniors, a website designed to empower seniors with knowledge and tools to navigate the digital landscape safely. The platform offers four core sections:The platform prioritises independence and confidence, empowering seniors to navigate the internet safely while reducing reliance on family members for technical support.Creating Shield Seniors required balancing multiple responsibilities. Tejasvi remained active in Scouting America, earned her Eagle Scout rank, played violin in her school orchestra, tutored refugees online, and volunteered in food security initiatives—all while designing and coding the platform.Her work has earned national recognition. She received an honorable mention in the 2024 Congressional App Challenge, delivered a 2025 TEDx talk on bridging digital divides, and became TIME Magazine’s Kid of the Year 2025, also earning the distinction of TIME for Kids Service Star.Tejasvi credits her success to strong mentorship. Her parents provided hands-on support in coding and cybersecurity, while Aarathi Rajamanickam, a software engineering manager, served as a mentor, offering guidance in AI, cybersecurity, and software development. Programs such as Girls Who Code and Cyber-Patriot further honed her technical skills, preparing her to address real-world cybersecurity threats effectively.Currently in private preview mode, Shield Seniors relies on a free AI engine that limits audience capacity. Tejasvi is fundraising to transition to a commercial AI platform to expand access and reach more seniors nationwide. She also plans to conduct in-person workshops at assisted-living facilities, helping older adults gain hands-on experience in cybersecurity.Her vision is clear: to empower seniors to navigate the online world independently, confidently, and safely while educating families on supporting older relatives in protecting themselves from fraud.","Tejasvi manoj is a high school student, accomplished coder, and founder of shield seniors, a cybersecurity platform aimed at educating and protecting older adults from online scams.

Larry Ellison, the co-founder of Oracle, has officially overtaken Tesla CEO Elon Musk to become the world’s richest man in 2025. Ellison’s net worth soared by an extraordinary $101 billion in a single day, marking the largest one-day wealth increase ever recorded in the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. His fortune now stands at $393 billion, surpassing Elon Musk. This dramatic shift was fueled by Oracle’s record-breaking earnings report, which sent the company’s stock price soaring. For Musk, the decline in Tesla’s share value has ended his nearly year-long reign at the top. The development underscores the powerful link between corporate performance, stock markets, and the global billionaire wealth rankings.For the first time in his long career, Larry Ellison has claimed the top position on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. At 81 years old, Ellison’s rise highlights his enduring influence in the tech world and the extraordinary growth of Oracle Corporation. His fortune has now reached $393 billion, surpassing Elon Musk, who had dominated global wealth rankings since 2024.The driving force behind Ellison’s climb was Oracle’s blockbuster earnings report.The company delivered higher-than-expected quarterly results, a surge in bookings, and an ambitious outlook for future growth in cloud services. This fueled a 41% single-day stock rally, the largest in Oracle’s history. Since Ellison holds most of his wealth in Oracle shares, the stock surge translated into an unprecedented $101 billion personal gain.Meanwhile, Elon Musk’s net worth has slipped due to Tesla’s challenges. Shares of the electric vehicle giant are down 13% in 2025, dragging his fortune to $385 billion and ending his nearly year-long reign at the top. Despite the setback, Musk remains a strong contender, with Tesla’s board proposing a performance-based compensation plan that could make him the world’s first trillionaire if he meets aggressive milestones.Ellison’s ascent also underscores Oracle’s growing presence in the cloud computing market, where it is increasingly challenging industry leaders Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure. With Ellison serving as chairman and chief technology officer, the company’s bold expansion into cloud infrastructure has redefined its role in global tech and cemented his position as the wealthiest man alive.Larry Ellison is one of the most influential figures in the technology industry, best known as the co-founder, Executive Chairman, and Chief Technology Officer (CTO) of Oracle Corporation. Oracle, a global leader in enterprise software and cloud computing, was founded in the late 1970s when Ellison and his team pioneered relational database systems that would eventually dominate the market.For nearly four decades, Ellison served as Oracle’s Chief Executive Officer, shaping its rise from a small start-up into one of the world’s most powerful software companies. He stepped down as CEO in 2014 after 37 years at the helm, but unlike many founders who move aside, Ellison retained direct involvement in the company’s innovation strategy. In his role as Executive Chairman and CTO, he continues to steer Oracle’s research, product development, and long-term direction.Ellison also remains the company’s largest shareholder, owning about 41% of Oracle’s outstanding shares, a stake that forms the backbone of his immense personal fortune. This deep tie between his wealth and Oracle’s performance has made his financial trajectory closely mirror the company’s growth.According to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, Ellison’s fortune now stands at an extraordinary $393 billion as of September 10, 2025. This figure reflects the dramatic one-day surge fueled by Oracle’s earnings report and positions him ahead of Musk, whose net worth is currently estimated at $385 billion.The $101 billion leap was not only historic but also symbolic, highlighting how shifts in the technology sector—particularly the cloud computing race—are reshaping the global wealth rankings. Ellison’s rise to the top underscores both the resilience of Oracle under his leadership and his continued relevance as a driving force in Silicon Valley even at the age of 81.","Larry ellison’s net worth soared by an extraordinary $101 billion in a single day, marking the largest one-day wealth increase ever recorded in the bloomberg billionaires index.

The key change simplifies what was once a multi-step procedure into a single-step process—now limited to submitting the application and paying the service fee.This major shift is intended to eliminate bureaucratic friction, enhance the customer experience, and align with the UAE’s wider goal of delivering efficient, digital-first government services. The ICP highlighted that this move is consistent with its broader strategy to modernise smart services, shorten service journeys, and meet the public’s expectations for convenience and accessibility.A central feature of the revamped system is the automatic determination of the Emirates ID validity period, a model borrowed from the country’s passport service. The validity is assigned as follows:This applies when the service requested is renewal.In the case of replacement, the new ID card will be issued with the same validity period remaining on the existing card. Applicants cannot alter or extend the validity duration manually in any scenario.The Emirates ID application form has also undergone a redesign in the smart services system, available via the ICP’s official website and mobile application. Notable improvements include:These changes help citizens complete the process more quickly, while reducing the possibility of errors or duplication.The updated services for both Emirates ID renewal and replacement are already live and accessible through the ICP’s online platforms. Citizens can now complete the full process through the website or smart app, without needing to navigate multiple steps or submit duplicate information.This transition marks another milestone in the UAE's commitment to digitally transform public services, enhance operational efficiency, and reinforce its reputation for excellence in governance and service delivery.UAE citizens can now renew or replace their Emirates ID through a simplified process that involves just one step. Here’s how the process works:","Uae citizens can now renew or replace their emirates id in one step. Age-based validity auto-assigned through icp’s digital platforms.

More kids overweight than underweight: UN,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/more-kids-overweight-than-underweight-un/articleshow/123819367.cms,"Metabolic Syndrome & Obesity: What You Need to Know





Globally, being overweight is now the dominant form of malnutrition among school-age children and adolescents, having overtaken thinness (being underweight), Unicef's latest report reveals. It said 20% (one in five) of children between 5-19 years were overweight in 2022, while only 10% or one in 10 were underweight. This was a sharp change from 2000, when 13% were underweight and 11% overweight.The report held the ultra-processed food and beverage industry responsible for this and urged govts to take steps to protect kids' diets.The Unicef report urged countries to limit the availability, marketing and purchase of unhealthy foods and beverages, including ultra-processed foods (UPF). The report titled 'Feeding Profit: How food environments are failing children' elaborates on how the ultra-processed food and beverage industry holds disproportionate influence over children's food environments.""It (UPF and beverage industry) shapes what foods and beverages are produced and how they are marketed, especially in settings where govt regulation is weak or absent. In pursuit of profit, the industry leverages vast financial resources and deep political influence to resist policies aimed at creating healthier, more equitable food environments,"" stated the report.According to the report, low and middle-income countries are experiencing the steepest rise in the proportion of the overweight among school-age children and adolescents. It found that unhealthy foods and beverages, including ultra-processed foods and beverages, were widely available, inexpensive and aggressively marketed in the places where children live, learn and play. It added that inexpensive UPFs and beverages were flooding retail markets and infiltrating schools.It cited a study in Tanzania and Zimbabwe which revealed how public-private partnerships have enabled ultra-processed food companies to distribute ultra-processed products in schools, build brand loyalty among young learners and strengthen their corporate reputation. ""The unethical business practices of the ultra-processed food and beverage industry undermine efforts to put legal measures and policies in place to protect children from unhealthy food environments,"" stated the report.Recommendations for govts included the establishment of ""robust safeguards to protect public policy processes from interference by the ultra-processed food industry"". This includes conflict-of-interest safeguards, the exclusion of UPF and beverage industry actors from involvement in policy development and implementation.","Being overweight is now the dominant form of malnutrition among school-age children and adolescents, unicef's latest report reveals.

As global mobility continues to rise, the United Arab Emirates, particularly Dubai , has positioned itself as a hub for professionals, entrepreneurs, and remote workers. With 88% of its population made up of expats, the UAE offers a range of visa options tailored to different work profiles.

Life and legacy of Larry Ellison

Family and personal interests





“When people start telling you that you’re crazy, you just might be on to the most important innovation in your life,” Larry Ellison said in 2016. Fast forward to 2025, he is at the most important position in the billionaires’ world—the richest man on Earth with a staggering net worth of $393 billion. The 81-year-old Oracle cofounder dethroned Elon Musk after Oracle’s stock soared on the back of massive AI-driven cloud contracts, propelling his wealth by an unprecedented $101 billion overnight. As of September 10, 2025, Ellison’s fortune stands at an astonishing $393 billion, placing him at the top of the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.Larry Ellison co-founded Oracle Corporation in 1977, then known as Software Development Laboratories. The company quickly rose to prominence with Oracle Version 2 (1979), the first commercially available SQL-based relational database management system (RDBMS). This innovation secured Oracle’s leadership in enterprise database technology through the 1980s and 1990s.Under Ellison’s leadership, Oracle became the world’s largest database management company by 1987 and went public in 1986. The company expanded aggressively, acquiring PeopleSoft in 2005, Sun Microsystems in 2010, and NetSuite in 2016, moves that cemented Oracle’s presence in enterprise applications, hardware, and cloud infrastructure.Ellison’s vision transformed Oracle from a startup into a $40 billion-plus software powerhouse.In the 2020s, Oracle pivoted strongly into artificial intelligence and cloud services, becoming a key provider for AI companies hungry for computing power. As CTO and executive chairman, Ellison drove the development of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), purpose-built for AI workloads with custom networking and chips. In 2025, Oracle unveiled its $500 billion Stargate initiative to build global AI infrastructure and industry-specific platforms, making it a central force in AI inference, a multi-trillion-dollar emerging market.The launch of Oracle’s AI Database, integrating enterprise data with models like ChatGPT, reinforced its dominance. By unifying hardware, software, and cloud services under one roof, Oracle reduced latency and costs, setting itself apart from rivals. These innovations have powered Oracle’s stock to double in 2025, sending Ellison’s fortune soaring.Ellison’s net worth of $393 billion pushed him past Tesla CEO Elon Musk, whose wealth fell to $385 billion as Tesla’s shares slid 13% this year and its U.S. market share dropped to its lowest since 2017. Ellison also overtook Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, who previously held the second-richest spot. Musk, who first claimed the title in 2021 before losing it to Jeff Bezos and Bernard Arnault, reclaimed the crown in 2024 and held it for nearly 300 days. Ellison’s ascent marks the first time he has reached the very top, reshaping the billionaire rivalry in Silicon Valley.Beyond Oracle, Ellison has built a diverse portfolio. In August 2025, he acquired nearly 50% of Paramount Skydance, the $28 billion media giant formed through the merger of Paramount and his son David’s Skydance. He also served on Tesla’s board from 2018 to 2022 and was a significant shareholder during his tenure. These ventures highlight Ellison’s strategy of combining core technology investments with cultural influence, extending his impact beyond the enterprise software world.Born in 1944, Ellison dropped out of both the University of Illinois and the University of Chicago before beginning his career building databases for the CIA. He went on to lead Oracle for 37 years as CEO before stepping down in 2014 to become executive chairman and CTO. Known for his bold personality and risk-taking approach, Ellison has left an indelible mark on the software and cloud industry. In 2012, he bought nearly the entire Hawaiian island of Lanai for $300 million, later moving there permanently in 2020. His career reflects both persistence and a willingness to defy convention.Ellison has four children, two of whom—Megan and David—are influential Hollywood producers. Megan Ellison financed critically acclaimed films like Zero Dark Thirty and American Hustle, while David produced mainstream blockbusters such as The Terminator and Mission: Impossible. Outside business, Ellison is a passionate sailor and maintains a relatively private lifestyle despite his immense fortune. His limited philanthropy score contrasts with his reputation as one of Silicon Valley’s most daring entrepreneurs.With Oracle’s AI-powered rise and his net worth surpassing $393 billion, Ellison has proven that vision and persistence can outlast rivals. Today, at 81, he is not only the richest man alive but also one of the most influential figures shaping the future of technology.","Ellison dethroned elon musk after oracle’s stock soared on the back of massive ai-driven cloud contracts.

After Tariffs, Now U.S. To Deprive Indians Of H-1B Visas? Trump Aide's Big Hint

What is false STEM workforce shortage?







Rep Riley Moore said he proposed an amendment to stop the abuse of the H-1B visa program and the House Appropriations Committee approved it. The amendment instructs the US labor department to investigate the 'fake shortage' of the STEM workforce and submit a report on it. The development comes as the US tech workforce is calling for the scrapping of the H-1B visa program altogether so that US jobs are not stolen by foreigners. H-1B visa program allows companies to bring in foreign workforce, but according to experts, it has now become an easy option for companies to save money by bringing in cheap labor for even entry-level posts which do not require high skill. But as hiring US workforce would cost more, H-1B is go-to for several Silicon Valley companies.""The H-1B program has been grossly abused to undercut the American worker and replace domestic talent with foreign workers. @HouseAppropsGOP passed my amendment pushing back on the false STEM workforce shortage claims used to import foreign workers. The amendment directs the @USDOL to examine the H-1B and Schedule A list and provide a report on how these programs harm the American worker,"" Moore posted on X.Companies cite that there is a shortage of skills in US in Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths and therefore they have to hire from foreign countries like China and India, traditionally known for being strong in the STEM stream.But several research found out that the shortage is exaggerated -- companies are inflating the figure while US STEM students remain jobless.The Trump administration is planning an overhaul of the H-1B program so that it does not clash with entry-level jobs. The proposed changes want companies to hire from foreign countries only in roles that require high skills and will have high wages. Entry-level hiring from the H-1B pool will not be allowed in the new system, according to the proposal.",Republican leader riley moore brings amendment to stop h-1b abuse.

MUMBAI: At 60, when few people gather the courage to try something new, Steve Waugh is undertaking an entrepreneurial stint in India.The former Australian captain who enthralled fans with his gritty batting is launching Australia Essence, a business venture he co-founded, here to tap into the country's booming retail market where consumers are increasingly seeking better choices and willing to spend on premium products.""I have always had that entrepreneurial spirit. I love doing deals, being involved with something new, it takes me out of my comfort zone. I love the challenge of being successful,"" Waugh told TOI.Waugh's ties with India, a place he calls his ""second home"" goes beyond cricket. Deeply influenced by Mother Teresa, he has been actively involved in steering philanthropic endeavours in the country though his foundation. Since 1998, Waugh has supported Udayan, a home for children whose families are affected by leprosy and helped raise funds for Nivedita Bhavan, the girls' wing of the facility.Entrepreneurship is not new to Waugh-he has been invested in the Australian business landscape including investments in startups. In India, where the number of startups is growing, Waugh said he will not shy away from backing companies as long as the offer is attractive and the company is interesting.Australia Essence is building a house of brands platform-the strategy is to onboard varied premium consumer brands from Australia and launch them in India which the company said is riding on a ""premiumisation wave."" To begin with, nine brands are foraying into the country.The focus will be to build a play in the food, artisanal beverages, skincare and high-performance apparel where high earning Indians are looking for differentiated products, spending on clean labels in food and beauty.The target consumers will be the urban middle class whose aspirations are ""rising."" With digitisation making premium more accessible, the market opportunity extends well beyond metros, said Tim Thomas, CEO at Australia Essence. Waugh said that his strong partnership with India over the years will help in growing the venture in the market. ""My area of expertise is contacts, networks, knowing people and putting people together,"" Waugh said, adding that cricket has taught him perseverance, a trait which he will be carrying with him in the echelons of the business world.Waugh doesn't miss the cricket field any more but he does follow the game, especially Test cricket. Rishabh Pant is his current favourite Indian cricketer and Waugh likes the way he plays. He was also full of praise for Test skipper Shubman Gill and was impressed by his performance in England. Asked about his favourites from yesteryears, Waugh said, ""It's a hard to pick one....Tendulkar, Dravid...Gavaskar.""","Waugh is launching australia essence, a business venture he co-founded.
