Instagram war explodes as Jordon Hudson exposes Linda Holliday’s 'delusional' letter to Bill Belichick



Things are heating up off the football field for former New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick, but this time, the drama isn’t about playbooks—it’s about a fiery love triangle making waves on social media. His current girlfriend, 24-year-old pageant contestant Jordon Hudson, has allegedly taken direct aim at his longtime ex-partner Linda Holliday in a now-viral Instagram exchange.According to the Daily Mail, Hudson was engaged in a heated back-and-forth with someone she believed to be close to Holliday. The argument ignited when the woman allegedly branded Hudson a “gold digger” and accused her of taking advantage of the 73-year-old NFL legend. Hudson, however, did not hold back in her response and delivered a blistering message that included references to a letter Holliday wrote to Belichick nearly a decade ago.“Hey babes! Since you are tight with Ms Holliday, would you please ask her what she would like me to do with this letter I found from 2015?” Hudson reportedly wrote in a message shared via screenshot. She added, “Due to its pathetic and embarrassing content, I imagine she wants it back.She should make the point to burn it so she continue [sic] to live in delusional denial.”The letter in question was supposedly found by Hudson at Belichick’s $2.2 million Hingham home in an old invoice file. In it, Holliday had allegedly poured out her frustrations over being excluded from aspects of Belichick’s life and his ongoing loyalty to ex-wife Debbie Clarke. Holliday had written, “I’m the one that loves and adores you... tries to ALWAYS remind you how grateful I am of your love,” expressing feelings of being sidelined in favor of Clarke, despite her love and commitment to the coach.Belichick and Holliday were together for 16 years before parting ways in 2023. Shortly after, Belichick's romance with Hudson became public. The couple reportedly first met on a flight in 2021 and have since been spotted attending high-profile events, including the NFL Honors.But Hudson's entry into Belichick's world has been far from seamless. Page Six reports that she has been “iced out” by Nantucket’s elite social scene—where Holliday remains a central figure. Her growing influence in Belichick’s post-Patriots chapter has raised eyebrows too, especially after she was seen on the field at UNC, where Belichick has taken a new role. Some reports suggest she’s even being looped into work emails and possibly pitching involvement in media projects like Hard Knocks.Despite the noise, Belichick has publicly defended Hudson, stating she leads his “professional opportunities” outside UNC. Whether this storm settles or intensifies remains to be seen—but one thing is clear: this isn’t your typical offseason drama.Also Read: How Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen built their marriage on trust and acceptance of each other’s pasts?","Bill belichick's current girlfriend, 24-year-old pageant contestant jordon hudson, has allegedly taken direct aim at his longtime ex-partner linda holliday in a now-viral instagram exchange.

Social media spotlight turns into scrutiny

Marital rumors and viral TikTok moments

Politics, PR optics, and the rumored Taylor Swift tension

Brittany Mahomes may be known as Patrick Mahomes' high-profile wife, but she’s built a presence—and controversy—of her own. From Instagram buzz to alleged feuds and political tension, Brittany has faced a relentless cycle of rumors that continue to put her under the microscope.Brittany Mahomes, a former soccer player and now a fitness entrepreneur, commands over 2 million followers online. With a net worth reportedly around $15 million, she’s transformed her visibility into a powerful brand. But with fame has come a wave of public speculation about her appearance.After fans accused her of undergoing plastic surgery, Brittany addressed the gossip head-on. “Filler in my lips,” she admitted during a 2023 Q&A on Instagram. As for breast augmentation, she joked under a bikini photo, “Haters will say they are fake, but breastfeeding moms will understand.” Her bold honesty has earned her both admiration and criticism.Despite her picture-perfect image with Patrick Mahomes, whispers of tension have emerged. A viral clip from a Texas Tech basketball game in June 2025 showed Brittany mocking Patrick’s “resting b***h face” comment. It echoed a similar moment from 2022, leading some fans to speculate that not all is well in the Mahomes household.In an April 2023 Q&A, Brittany revealed she doesn’t take flirtations toward Patrick lightly. “It's actually really sad how disrespectful some women are,” she said, acknowledging the emotional toll of life in the public eye.One of the most talked-about topics remains her rumored friction with Taylor Swift, reportedly stemming from political differences. Brittany’s support for Donald Trump—highlighted in a September 2024 Truth Social post—seemingly clashed with Swift’s endorsement of Kamala Harris. At Super Bowl LIX, they notably didn’t sit together, with one Daily Mail source citing “PR reasons” due to Trump’s presence.Though neither party has publicly addressed a falling out, the once-hyped idea of a Brittany-Taylor BFF dynamic now feels far-fetched.Amid divorce rumors, family tension with Jackson Mahomes, and endless online speculation, Brittany continues to push forward with grit. As she once said on the WHOOP podcast, Patrick told her, “Stop caring about what people think, especially the people that don't even know you.”Also Read: Chiefs' Trey Smith exposes Travis Kelce’s behaviour, calls him crazy and psycho Whether she's clapping back at rumors or balancing motherhood and business, Brittany Mahomes is clearly unbothered by the chaos—and she’s not slowing down.",Brittany mahomes is the wife of kansas city chiefs quarterback patrick mahomes.

What made Tom Brady say yes to the Netflix roast? Jeff Ross finally reveals the surprising reason,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/what-made-tom-brady-say-yes-to-the-netflix-roast-jeff-ross-finally-reveals-the-surprising-reason/articleshow/122101311.cms,"How did Jeff Ross manage to get Tom Brady on board for Netflix’s biggest roast special yet? (Getty Images)

What inspired Tom Brady to allow a roast on national TV?



In 2024, NFL legend Tom Brady did something few athletes of his stature would dare—he let himself be roasted on live television. Netflix’s The Roast of Tom Brady turned into a cultural spectacle, drawing 13.8 million views in its first week and becoming the platform’s most-watched one-off special. But what led the seven-time Super Bowl champion, known for his unshakable poise and ironclad image, to become the target of biting jokes and brutal humor?The idea was seeded years earlier. Comedian Jeff Ross, the “Roastmaster General,” recounted the story on The Howard Stern Show. According to Ross, the journey started when he noticed something peculiar on Super Bowl Sunday, February 7, 2021—Tom Brady had been browsing his Instagram. “I had seen him looking at my Instagram on Super Bowl Sunday a few years ago,” Ross told Stern. “I was like, ‘Why the f--- is Tom Brady on my Instagram?’”Ross had some edgy jokes posted, and surprisingly, Brady seemed to enjoy them. That same night, Brady led the Tampa Bay Buccaneers to a Super Bowl LV victory over the Chiefs. The next day, Ross sent him a message: “Dude, it’s time for a roast. You obviously love this s---.” That Instagram DM snowballed into a full-fledged deal when Ross discovered that both their agents happened to work together. Netflix eagerly jumped on board.While many wondered what possessed Brady to say yes to such a ruthless format, Ross offered insight.“I said to Tom right beforehand, ‘Why are you doing this?,’ and he goes, ‘I love this kind of humor. People are too snowflakey right now.’” Brady’s willingness to embrace self-deprecating comedy revealed a side of him fans rarely get to see—one that doesn’t take itself too seriously, even after two decades of football dominance.The journey to the live roast wasn’t smooth. “It took so long,” Ross explained. “Then he retired… then unretired… then was going through a divorce… then Netflix picked a festival date… and then we decided to do it live.”Of course, not every moment was easy to stomach. During the special, Ross cracked a joke about Patriots owner Robert Kraft and massage parlors, prompting Brady to mutter, “Don’t say that s--- again.” Ross later said, “I think Tom was checking me the way a lawyer objects on behalf of a client.”Despite its success, Brady expressed personal regret—not for being roasted, but for the unintended emotional toll on his children. “I loved when the jokes were about me… I didn’t like the way it affected my kids,” he shared on The Pivot podcast. “I wouldn’t do that again because of the way it affected… the people I care about the most in the world.”Still, Brady’s roast was a powerful reminder: even legends can laugh at themselves—until the punchlines hit too close to home.Also Read: Travis Kelce’s new favorite Taylor Swift song is not what fans expected: Other NFL tight ends also turn Swifties","Netflix's the roast of tom brady drew 13.8 million views in its first week.

Microsoft sued by authors for allegedly using pirated books to train AI model,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/microsoft-sued-by-authors-for-allegedly-using-pirated-books-to-train-ai-model/articleshow/122088854.cms,"Authors accuse Microsoft of copyright infringement

Lawsuit demands damages and a court injunction

Legal backdrop: A turning point in AI copyright battles

Microsoft yet to respond publicly

A growing challenge for the AI industry





A group of prominent authors, including Pulitzer Prize winner Kai Bird and New Yorker writer Jia Tolentino, has filed a lawsuit against Microsoft, accusing the tech giant of illegally using pirated versions of their books to train its AI model known as “Megatron. ” Filed in a New York federal court on June 25, the suit claims that Microsoft copied nearly 200,000 copyrighted works without permission to develop AI systems that mimic the authors’ unique writing styles, themes, and voices. This marks another major legal challenge in the growing debate over AI training and copyright law.The plaintiffs allege that Microsoft used a massive dataset of pirated digital books to train Megatron, a generative AI model designed to produce human-like text. According to the complaint, the AI’s ability to replicate the tone, syntax, and narrative patterns of copyrighted works demonstrates a clear violation of intellectual property rights. The authors argue that their creative output was exploited to build a product that competes with them in the marketplace, without their consent or compensation.The writers are seeking statutory damages of up to $150,000 per infringed work, along with a court order to block Microsoft from continuing its alleged unauthorised use of their materials.While the exact number of infringed titles remains unclear, the plaintiffs claim that thousands of authors’ works may have been used without licence or attribution. The case could set a precedent for how courts handle AI training involving copyrighted content.This lawsuit comes just one day after a California judge ruled that AI firm Anthropic may have made “fair use” of copyrighted material in training but could still be liable for using pirated versions of books. It was the first US decision to address the legality of using copyrighted texts in generative AI development. The Microsoft case adds further momentum to a wave of lawsuits from writers, artists, and media outlets challenging how their work is used by tech companies.According to Reuters, Microsoft has not issued an official response to the allegations. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment when contacted by reporters. Meanwhile, legal observers say this case will be closely watched for its implications on the future of AI development and intellectual property rights.Tech firms including Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic have all faced similar legal scrutiny in recent time. The central argument from the companies is that using public data for AI training qualifies as “fair use” under US copyright law. However, rights holders argue that this approach undermines creators' control and devalues their work. As AI models become increasingly sophisticated, courts should define clearer boundaries around what constitutes ethical and legal data usage.",Authors accuse microsoft of copyright infringement.

The Art of Resilience

The Art of Focus

In a moment that appealed to seekers of spirituality as well as tech enthusiasts, there was an unforgettable exchange between Google CEO Sundar Pichai and ISKCON monk Gauranga Das at the India Global Forum 2025 in London. The discussion between them, which had started lively with a jocular remark about being youthful, soon turned into an introspective discussion on the stark contrast between corporate stress and spiritual tranquility.Gauranga Das, a graduate from IIT Bombay, who now heads programs in sustainable living and spiritual education, used the moment to highlight some of the most pressing concerns of our digital times - mental health and the increasing digital addiction epidemic.The difference between these two IIT graduates was more than physical or professional; it was philosophical. While one sits at the head of one of the most influential tech giants in the world, the other has dedicated his life to leading people to inner understanding and spiritual direction. The meeting wasn't merely a reunion; it was a comparison of two radically different directions based on the same intellectual heritage. It was an effective metaphor for the decisions contemporary society must make today: progress without equilibrium, or innovation backed by internal wellness.Gauranga Das and Sundar Pichai, though having started at the same time at IIT, followed different career paths early on in life. Pichai went into technology and became the CEO of Google, a company that is at the heart of the digital revolution. Das instead went down the path of spiritual discovery and service, becoming an ISKCON member and dedicating himself to bringing ancient wisdom into modern settings.Their meeting at the India Global Forum 2025 was noticed when Pichai noted the way young Gauranga Das looked compared to his age. Das responded with an answer that went viral instantly for its simplicity and profundity:This one sentence highlighted a wider discussion regarding what it means to live from purpose rather than performance. It also spawned a wider debate regarding how spiritual tools can assist with coping with rising levels of stress inflicted as a result of round-the-clock digital interaction.In his address to the forum, Gauranga Das reported shocking statistics regarding digital addiction, specifically social media. Based on the information he provided, more than 230 million individuals globally are addicted to social media. In India alone, 70% of adolescents spend as much as seven hours per day on the net, a figure that indicates increasing worry for parents, teachers, and mental health professionals.Das linked these figures to the wider problem of declining mental health worldwide. Referring to world trends, he identified that one in seven individuals is presently suffering from some sort of mental health difficulty. These are anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and chronic stress; maladies that are increasingly being attributed to excessive exposure to digital content and a mindfulness deficit in daily life.This was not simply an attack on technology, but a call to awaken to how we engage with it. Das leveraged the platform to promote a more holistic digital life, one that includes frequent breaks, mindful use, and spiritual anchoring.Gauranga Das is not only a monk who has spiritual wisdom; he is also an engineer who has been trained and who has a deep understanding of how technology functions and how it may affect human psychology. This makes him uniquely qualified in matters that lie at the interface between science and spirituality.Das is also a senior member of the Governing Body Commission of ISKCON and the director of Govardhan Ecovillage (GEV), a green living community that was established under the inspiration of Radhanath Swami. GEV is not only an ashram, it is a widely acclaimed model of how to apply ancient wisdom to modern sustainability practices. It won the UN World Tourism Organization Award in 2017, and it is also accredited with key United Nations organisations such as UNEP, ECOSOC, UNCCD, and CBD.Under Das's stewardship, GEV has turned into an exemplar of the way communities can be in harmony with nature yet maintain essential spiritual principles. It should not be astonishing that numerous young professionals, such as engineers, physicians, and policy makers, now journey to the Ecovillage for leadership training and retreats.Aside from his work in the Ecovillage, Gauranga Das also heads the Govardhan School of Public Leadership, an institution that prepares wannabe civil servants of India. The founder created the school to develop resilient leaders imbued with ethical values by the integration of Vedic wisdom alongside contemporary public policy training.Das also leads the Bhaktivedanta Research Centre, where ancient manuscripts are kept, translated, and analysed in academic contexts. This centre offers postgraduate studies in philosophy and comparative religion, providing students access to systems of knowledge that are both ancient and extremely useful today. The curriculum combines ancient insights with modern administrative frameworks, helping students navigate complexity, uncertainty, and moral dilemmas in real-world governance and social impact roles.Through such platforms, Das prioritises staying resilient, focused, and mentally clear; qualities that are typically undervalued in demanding corporate settings but are key to sustained success and satisfaction.To make spiritual insights more common, Gauranga Das has written two influential books:Both books borrow from scriptures such as the Bhagavad Gita but touch on very contemporary issues like office burnout, distraction, and individual discontentment. These books have spoken to spiritual seekers as well as working professionals seeking down-to-earth, real-life counsel on surviving life's stress.In interviews and talks, Das has consistently emphasised that spiritual tools are not exclusive to monks or renunciants. They are equally relevant to CEOs, students, and anyone navigating the complexities of modern life.","Sundar pichai's iit batchmate gauranga das who turned'monk' looks younger than him; his reason: 'you deal with google, i deal with god' 70% of indian teens spend 7 hours online: iskcon monk warns of mental health fallout.

Ethan sues SeanDaBlack

Internet's Verdict: “This Feels Racist”

“Creepy Klein adds black man to his list of victims for equality's sake (while on vacation).” one Redditor wrote.



“That’s right, you’re a misogynist and a racist. We already knew.”

“tf”



“(Mimicking Klein) ‘I mobilize my multi-million follower audience against smaller creators and cheer it on…’”



“‘I used to be racist... but honestly, I’ve not changed at all.’”



So… What Now?

On June 26, 2025, YouTuber Ethan Klein revealed via Instagram that he's adding Twitch streamer Sean “SeanDaBlack” Wiggs to his ongoing copyright lawsuits. The announcement — framed as a move toward “gender equality” — has sent the internet into meltdown, with fans and critics accusing Klein of being bothand. Here's the full drama unpacked.On June 26, 2025, Ethan Klein posted a cryptic but clear Instagram Story:This comes after Klein filed copyright lawsuits against Twitch streamers Denims, Frogan, and Kaceytron—all women. The backlash was instant. Many accused him of misogyny. His “solution”? Suing a Black man, apparently to balance the gender scale.Sean, who’s associated with HasanAbi, is no stranger to Klein’s critics. But this latest legal addition stunned even the most seasoned drama-watchers.He even gave a shoutout to Sean’s “snarker friends” — a not-so-subtle jab at Reddit communities like r/h3snark and r/LeftoversH3, who frequently roast Klein and his H3 Podcast.Almost immediately, Reddit and X (formerly Twitter) users slammed Klein’s latest legal move. The main accusation? That he’s masking racial bias under the guise of equality.Another bluntly called him both:The fact that this all went down while Klein was vacationing with his wife, Hila, didn’t help the optics. As one user sarcastically put it:A recurring criticism is that Klein tends to go after smaller creators. particularly women and people of color, instead of high-profile names like xQc or Asmongold, who’ve also reacted to his content. “Never beating the allegations. Just going after women and POCs,” one comment read. “Why not sue xQc? Too big to bully?” another added.Sean’s initial response was short and confused — literally just:He previously mocked Klein in a livestream, mimicking his tone while calling him out for allegedly weaponizing his massive audience:Sean also accused Klein of never owning up to past racist behavior, claiming the apology was more like:This latest lawsuit has turned an already chaotic legal battle into something much bigger — one that’s no longer just about copyright claims, but now includes race, power dynamics, and internet ethics. With both creators digging in their heels and Reddit on fire, this drama’s just getting started. One thing’s for sure: no one's walking away from this unscathed — not even Ethan Klein.

Investment will continue, with or without Microsoft: Softbank CEO

SoftBank is ‘all in’ on ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. CEO and Founder Masayoshi Son said the company is betting heavily on the artificial intelligence startup, with planned investments worth 4.8 trillion Japanese yen (around $33.2 billion). Son said he believes OpenAI, currently unlisted and not profitable, will eventually become “the most valuable company in the world.” Speaking at a shareholder meeting, Son said SoftBank’s long-term goal is to play a leading role in the era of artificial superintelligence (ASI)—a concept he described as AI that is 10,000 times smarter than humans. The Japanese tech conglomerate has been expanding its partnership with OpenAI this year, including joining the $500 billion Stargate project.During the meeting, Son also revealed that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had once asked SoftBank for a $10 billion investment before Microsoft signed its now well-known partnership with the AI firm. “I said, yes, I would,” Son told shareholders. But Altman eventually went with Microsoft.Microsoft recently lost its exclusive cloud provider status with OpenAI and hasn’t approved a reported restructuring plan to make OpenAI a traditional for-profit company.Despite the changing relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI, Son said SoftBank’s commitment remains firm. The company earlier stated it might reduce its stake if OpenAI doesn’t restructure by December 31, but Son clarified on Friday that their support will continue “regardless of what happens with Microsoft.”Son says OpenAI is key to SoftBank’s vision of building the world’s largest ASI platform. He aims for the company to become the “organizer of the industry in the artificial superintelligence era” within the next decade.SoftBank owns Arm, the UK-based chip company, and recently acquired U.S.-based chip designer Ampere for $6.5 billion. It is also reportedly exploring the creation of a $1 trillion AI-focused industrial complex in the United States.","Softbank ceo masayoshi son said the company is betting heavily on artificial intelligence startup openai.

Apple introduces new App Store fees in EU to avoid €500 million fine,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-introduces-new-app-store-fees-in-eu-to-avoid-500-million-fine/articleshow/122108489.cms,"New fee framework creates multiple payment tiers

Regulatory standoff continues despite changes

Apple has introduced sweeping changes to its European Union App Store policies, introducing a complicated multi-tier fee system aimed at avoiding crushing daily fines that could reach €50 million under the bloc's Digital Markets Act (DMA).The company now allows EU developers to freely link customers to alternative payment methods outside the App Store without restrictive warning screens or mandatory text. However, these freedoms come with new costs through Apple's revamped commission structure.Under the updated system, developers face up to three separate fees for a single app download. Apple introduced a "" Core Technology Commission "" of 5% on all digital purchases made outside the App Store, alongside an initial acquisition fee of 2% and variable store services fees ranging from 5% to 13%.The company also created a two-tier service structure. Tier 1 offers basic features like app reviews and fraud protection for a 5% commission, while Tier 2 provides full App Store benefits including automatic updates, marketing tools, and app insights for 13%. Small Business Program participants receive reduced rates.Apps using external payment links will pay the Core Technology Commission, while those merely referencing outside deals continue under the existing Core Technology Fee of €0.50 per download after one million installs.Apple's modifications follow a €500 million fine imposed in April for violating DMA anti-steering rules. The European Commission threatened additional daily penalties worth up to 5% of Apple's global revenue if the company failed to comply by June 26.""We disagree with this outcome and plan to appeal,"" Apple stated, maintaining its opposition to the regulatory requirements.Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney, whose company successfully challenged Apple's US steering policies, criticized the changes as ""malicious compliance"" that commercially cripples competing payment systems.The European Commission will now assess whether Apple's proposals achieve genuine DMA compliance before determining if additional fines are warranted.","New fee framework creates multiple payment tiers for eu developers.

How PewDiePie’s T-Series showdown became a symbol of creator independence

Felix Kjellberg, popularly known as PewDiePie , has officially fallen out of; a major moment for a creator who once reigned supreme. This shift reflects more than just subscriber numbers; it highlights YouTube's evolving algorithm, the rise of Shorts-based creators like, and PewDiePie’s own transition toward a quieter, family-focused life in Japan. Once the face of independent content creation, he now uploads occasionally for fun, no longer driven by metrics. Though no longer at the top, his legacy as a pioneer of online content and YouTube culture remains unmatched and deeply influential.PewDiePie started his YouTube career in 2010 with simple gaming Let's Plays. His unpolished humour, passionate personality, and genuine interaction allowed him to cut through the initial noise on YouTube. In. Between 2014 and 2017, he was also the, as reported.But PewDiePie was more than just another gamer; instead, he became a figure of independent creator culture, meme culture, and a community-driven paradigm that valued personality above polish. His style changed from horror gaming to vlogs, comedy sketches, meme reviews, and music, and he became one of the most diverse creators on the platform. Time magazine acknowledged his cultural influence inby including him on theirhas finally surpassedof leading the top positions on YouTube, as revealed in a report by. Kimpro828's short-form, viral content tailored for YouTube Shorts has seen his channel gain immense subscriber bases, helping him surpass PewDiePie to take theThis progression emphasizes a significant change in YouTube's algorithmic priority. Whereas PewDiePie previously dominated with long-form, personality-focused uploads, his exclusion from the Shorts platform has emerged as a turning point in his fall in rankings. He has never made a single YouTube Short, while others such as kimpro828 have used the format's blowout reach to drive their growth.In the creator economy today, success is increasingly tied to high-throughput, crew-operated channels optimized for YouTube's algorithmic tastes. Channels such as MrBeast, T-Series, and Cocomelon now dominate the uppermost charts by creating optimized, scalable content for worldwide audiences.Conversely, PewDiePie opted to take a more intimate route, retreating from the competitive pace. He started posting less regularly, prioritizing quality, enjoyment, and relationship building with his core group of followers.he explained to his viewers. PewDiePie’s drop in rankings is no mystery; he has been semi-retired since 2022, following his relocation to Japan with his wife, Marzia Kjellberg (formerly Marzia Bisognin). The couple, who met online in 2011 and got married in 2019 at London’s Royal Botanic Gardens in Kew, have embraced a quieter lifestyle.They had their first child, a son, Björn, in 2023. Posting the happy news on Instagram, Marzia captioned, ""11/07/2023 Welcome to the family, little Bjorn."" The duo now concentrates on home life, household renovations, and the occasional update for fans. With fatherhood and a quiet home life on their minds, PewDiePie has clearly opted out of the daily uploads, giving personal contentment more priority over being a dominant force on the platform.Numerous fans nostalgically recall PewDiePie's legendary subscriber war against T-Series in 2019 a campaign that became a cultural phenomenon for YouTube itself. The ""Subscribe to PewDiePie"" movement was a meme bigger than itself; it symbolized creator-driven authenticity against corporate content. Even though he ultimately lost the competition, the face-off managed to rally the online world around the principles PewDiePie stood for: independence, humor, and communion.Now, MrBeast has taken the crown that PewDiePie once held. With more than 408 million subscribers, MrBeast is leading the platform by a wide margin leaving even T-Series far behind with more than 100 million subscribers. Although PewDiePie is no longer part of YouTube's top 10, he perhaps does not need to be any longer. His legacy as the pioneer of digital content is untouchable. He created a template for future creators, made a career on YouTube possible, and demonstrated to the world how one human could wield global power without a brand name behind them.","Pewdiepie drops out of youtube’s top 10 channels after leading generation of creators.

‘It's not too late to change course’: Bill Gates

How to detect hidden cameras in a hotel room, just with your smartphone

Microsoft founder and former CEO Bill Gates has once again raised concerns over the impact of US government cutting funding for global health. Sharing a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), he warned that this could result in an additional 8 million child deaths by 2024. Gates cited a Lancet study on the cumulative impact of reductions in American aid. “It found that, by 2040, 8 million more children will die before their fifth birthday. To give some context for 8 million: That's how many children live in California, Texas, Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio combined,” Gates said.In the post, he writes “When the United States and other governments suddenly cut their aid budgets, I know for a fact that more children will die.”He said he has worked in the global health space for over 25 years and has seen how important aid is in saving lives. “Over the past 25 years—the same span of time I spent leading Microsoft—I have immersed myself in global health: building knowledge, deepening expertise, and working to save lives from deadly diseases and preventable causes. During that time, I have built teams of world-class scientists and public health experts at the Gates Foundation , studied health systems across continents, and worked in close partnership with national and local leaders to strengthen the delivery of lifesaving care,” he writes.“Global health aid saves lives. And when that aid is withdrawn—abruptly and without a plan—lives are lost,” Gates warned. “At this point, I know as much about improving health in poor countries as I do about software,” he further stated.Microsoft founder Bill Gates said that U.S. cuts to global health aid are already causing problems. He pointed out that important programs like tuberculosis testing and malaria prevention are slowing down, and life-saving medicines are getting delayed.Gates recently visited Nigeria and Ethiopia and said he saw for himself how healthcare services there are being affected by the funding cuts.Still, Gates said there is time to fix the situation. “It’s not too late to change course,” he wrote on X. He urged the U.S. Congress to restore funding for major programs such as PEPFAR (the U.S. plan for AIDS relief) and the Global Fund.",Microsoft founder and former ceo bill gates has once again raised concerns over the impact of us government cutting funding for global health.

The European Union has launched an antitrust investigation into Mars' acquisition of Pringles' maker Kellanova, it announced on Wednesday, citing concerns of market price hikes.In a preliminary assessment, the European Commission said the multibillion-dollar deal between the two US-based snack makers would increase Mars' bargaining power against EU retailers.Announced last August, the $35.9 billion (roughly €31 billion) deal was meant to bring two new billion-dollar brands, Pringles and Cheez-It, into Mars' fold.The EU said alarmed retailers across the 27-nation bloc reached out, expressing concerns regarding Mars' increased bargaining power should the deal go through.""By acquiring Kellanova, Mars will add several very popular brands of potato chips and cereals to its already broad and strong product portfolio,"" EU competition chief Teresa Ribera said. Aside from Pringles, Kellanova also produces Kellogg's cereals.Citing inflation and high food prices across the continent, Ribera stressed the importance of ensuring ""this acquisition does not further drive up the cost of shopping baskets.""She added that the EU's in-depth investigation will assess the deal's impact on the price of products sold by both companies.Mars, which also makes popular snacks including M&Ms and Snickers, defended the acquisition, saying it would ""deliver more choice and innovation to consumers.""""We are disappointed yet remain optimistic that this investigation will be positively resolved,"" the company said in a statement, adding that it was cooperating with the investigation.","The eu has launched an antitrust investigation into mars' acquisition of pringles' maker kellanova.

While global attention often lingers on freight disruptions and shipping capacity, a more transformational shift is quietly unfolding between India and the United Arab Emirates. The two economies are not simply moving more goods—they are reimagining the infrastructure that enables it. At the center of this transformation is the India–Dubai corridor—where bilateral investments, joint digital systems, and co-developed logistics hubs are setting a new benchmark for regional trade cooperation.From deep-sea ports in Gujarat to dry port ecosystems in Maharashtra, and from Dubai’s electric vehicle–equipped logistics hubs to shared cargo visibility platforms, a next-generation trade corridor is taking shape. This is not just about improving trade. It is about engineering interdependence through concrete, code, and coordinated policy.In January 2025, DP World confirmed a $2.5 billionglobal investment package, with a significant share allocated to Indian logistics partnerships and multimodal corridors connecting the subcontinent to the UAE. “This US$ $2.5 billion commitment reflects our confidence in long-term trade growth and our determination to build the infrastructure needed to keep the world connected,” H.E. Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, Group Chairman and CEO of DP World, had then emphasised.The Tuna Tekra terminal in Gujarat, developed in partnership with Adani Ports, is a flagship project. The facility includes a 1.1-kilometre berth, advanced handling equipment, and direct rail access to India’s Western Dedicated Freight Corridor. It is already being positioned as a key node for cargo headed toward the Middle East, Africa, and Europe.“Gujarat’s port infrastructure is no longer just for maritime throughput—it’s becoming a base for integrated, value-added logistics,” said an official at India’s Ministry of Ports.On the other side of the Arabian Sea, Jebel Ali Port continues to evolve. With over 1,000 Indian companiesoperating out of its Free Zone, and increasing warehousing demand from Indian exporters of electronics, textiles, and pharmaceuticals, Dubai’s role is shifting from a gateway to a collaborative hub. This deepening integration between Indian exporters and Dubai’s multimodal logistics network is now being reinforced by a shared emphasis on sustainability and innovation—marking a new phase in the bilateral trade journey.Sustainability is no longer a talking point—it is a design principle. At JNPT, India’s busiest container port, a $131 millionmodernisation initiative funded by the Asian Development Bank is installing electric cranes, upgrading yards, and integrating solar energy into port operations.“Enhancing trade infrastructure is no longer about volume alone. It’s about climate resilience, smart energy, and urban integration,” said Ashok Lavasa, Vice-President for Private Sector Operations and Public–Private Partnerships – Asian Development Bank (ADB)Across the Gulf, DP World’s Jebel Ali Port is deploying AI-enabled route planning for electric terminal vehicles. The model draws on lessons from the company’s Callao port in Peru, where EV deployment saved 2,400 tonnesof CO₂ in just over a year.India’s Jalna Dry Port in Maharashtra is another vital node in the corridor. Once operational, it will process up to 10 million TEUs annually, directly linking central India’s industries to global export lanes via JNPT and Tuna Tekra.“India’s freight corridors and dry port ecosystems are starting to mirror the integrated logistics we’ve built in Dubai—tailored for domestic scale and rural access,” said a DP World infrastructure planner involved in Indian operations.Dubai is responding in kind. The Roads and Transport Authorityhas announced feasibility studies to build inland consolidation hubs based on India’s Jalna and Dadri dry port models, aimed at decentralising last-mile freight.Digital transformation is perhaps the most forward-looking development. In Q1 2025, Indian Customs and Dubai’s Ports, Customs and Free Zone Corporation began piloting a joint cargo visibility platform. The blockchain-enabled dashboard allows real-time tracking from Indian factories to UAE warehouses. It also integrates customs clearances, container scans, and CO₂ footprint calculators. Industry leaders such as Soham Chokshi, CEO & Co-Founder of Shipsy, emphasise that digital visibility and automation are now mission-critical for SMEs exporting through corridors like India–Dubai, driving both reliability and sustainability.On digitalisation and future-ready shipping, the Union Minister reiterated how it is the core strategy of India’s maritime policy. India’s naval policies, such as ONOP, NLP (Marine), and MAITRI, are streamlining port services, reducing transaction times, and enabling real-time data. India is also partnering with the UAE and Singapore to create Virtual Trade Corridors for seamless cargo movement.“India’s maritime vision, rooted in ‘’, promotes collaboration and shared prosperity. As a reliable and responsible partner, India is committed to building a green, secure, and inclusive maritime future,” said Union Minister Sarbananda Sonowal.Meanwhile, DP World has begun rolling out digital twin technology in terminals at Nhava Sheva and Mundra, following successful deployments at London Gateway and Constanța. These simulations help ports optimise traffic flows, test maintenance windows, and reduce idle time for container lifts.What’s unfolding is not merely an exchange of goods—it’s a shared blueprint for long-term infrastructure reliability and strategic cooperation. For India, it means access to high-performing logistics frameworks. For Dubai, it strengthens its position as a global distribution centre for South Asian exports into Africa, Europe, and the wider Middle East.Click this link for more on Business in Dubai.",A transformational shift is quietly unfolding between india and the united arab emirates.

Saudi Arabia has launched a special initiative to mark the beginning of the Hijri New Year, offering a grace period for visitors holding expired visit visas to legally remain in the country for an additional 30 days before departure.According to an official statement from the Kingdom's General Directorate of Passports, the extension period will begin on 1 Muharram 1447 AH, corresponding to June 27, 2025. This initiative applies to all types of visit visas that have expired, aiming to ease the process for individuals who need more time to finalize their departure from Saudi Arabia.To benefit from this initiative, applicants must first settle any outstanding fees or fines associated with their visas as required by current regulations. The Directorate emphasized that failure to clear these dues could prevent visitors from obtaining the extension.The visa extension request can be submitted exclusively through the Tawasul service, available on the Ministry of Interior’s ""Absher"" electronic platform. This digital service streamlines the application process, making it accessible and convenient for all eligible visitors.Authorities have called on all affected visitors to take advantage of this opportunity within the designated 30-day window. The move is part of broader efforts to support visitors and ensure compliance with immigration rules during the significant occasion of the Hijri New Year.","Starting june 27, saudi arabia will allow expired visit visa holders a 30-day window to settle fines and exit the country legally.
