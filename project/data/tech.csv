"ED searches Bengaluru offices of Soros’s foundation, and entities linked to it",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-searches-bengaluru-offices-of-soross-foundation-and-entities-linked-to-it/articleshow/119185811.cms,"ED action coincides with heat Soros is facing back home

NEW DELHI: Enforcement Directorate on Tuesday conducted extensive searches on Open Society Foundations (OSF), promoted by US billionaire currency speculator and hedge fund operator George Soros who has been accused by BJP of acting against India’s interests.The raids in Bengaluru at OSF and linked entities were the fallout of an inquiry into FDI sourced by OSF in violation of Foreign Exchange Management Act guidelines.Sources said Open Society Institute, US, has been put under prior reference category (PRC) by the home mini stry since 2016 due to allegedly undesirable activities. So, OSI is required to secure prior sanction from the ministry to send funds to FCRA-registered organisations in India.Sources said investigation found Soros Economic Development Fund (SEDF), OSI’s social impact investment arm, provided funds to 3 Indian companies — Rootbridge Services Pvt Ltd (RSPL), Rootbridge Academy Pvt Ltd (RAPL), and ASAR Social Impact Advisors Pvt Ltd (ASAR). These companies received approximately Rs 25 crore from SEDF between 2020-21 and 2023-24.SEDF funds to RSPL were through compulsorily convertible preference shares. However, since SEDF could not make foreign donations directly to Indian NGOs without MHA approval, the George Soros-funded entity explored alternative options to bypass PRC restrictions. FDI in RSPL is suspected to be a colourable arrangement violating FDI norms, officials said.“RAPL, incorporated in 2019, received Rs 2.7 crore from SEDF as commission agent services without rendering any services. This suggests RAPL acted as an agent for SEDF to bypass FCRA provisions for funding NGOs in India,” a source said.ASAR, incorporated in 2016, received Rs 2.9 crore from SEDF as ‘service fees’. The investigators, however, are not convinced and suspect the funds to be donations in disguise, meant for NGOs in lieu of services which were, in fact, never rendered to SEDF.OSI group also set up an investment company, Aspada Investment Company (AIC), in Mauritius to channelise funding to India.Aspada Investment Advisors Pvt Ltd was established in Bengaluru to manage SEDF’s investments in India. However, the body, now Lightrock Investment Advisors Private Limited, was not in the loop about Rs 300 crore SEDF provided to 12 NGOs.ED action coincides with the heat Soros has been facing back home in the US after the election of Donald Trump as President. The hedge fund operator had aligned with hardline liberals and openly opposed Trump.","The raids in bengaluru at osf and linked entities were the fallout of an inquiry into fdi sourced by osf in violation of foreign exchange management act guidelines.

Srinagar resident arrested for extremist propaganda on social media,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/srinagar-resident-arrested-for-extremist-propaganda-on-social-media/articleshow/119175161.cms,"SRINAGAR: J&K Police’s counter intelligence wing in Kashmir (CIK) has arrested a Srinagar resident operating a radical social media handle by the name of Shaddy Kashmir Dryfruits “to disseminate extremist content with an intention to disturb peace”.The accused, Showkat Ahmad Dar , was found to be “actively engaged in posting and sharing content aimed at glorifying terrorism and terrorist commanders and inciting anti-national sentiments among young minds”, CIK said on Tuesday.The arrest was made after the special monitoring units established by social media companies on the directions of intelligence agencies flagged the extremist propaganda being run by the handle.A swift investigation led to the identification of the suspect behind the handle. Eﬀorts to track him were initially hindered because of his constant movement and change of location, but he was eventually apprehended.A preliminary inspection of Dar’s digital devices provided access to his Facebook account and some incriminating materials, including a video of terrorist commander Zakir Rashid Bhat alias Zakir Musa, who was killed on May 23, 2019.Dar, police said, has a history of radical activities. “He was previously arrested in 2019 for involvement in stone-pelting. In 2022, he was detained by Srinagar’s cyber police station for online dissemination of radical content.His arrest highlighted “the commitment of law enforcement agencies to curb online radicalisation and safeguard the youth from extremist influences”, a police statement said.",J&k police’s counter intelligence wing in kashmir (cik) has arrested a srinagar resident operating a radical social media handle by the name of shaddy kashmir dryfruits.

"Proposed higher wage for H-1B visa holders may hinder hiring of freshers, scientists and engineers",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/proposed-higher-wage-for-h-1b-visa-holders-may-hinder-hiring-of-freshers-scientists-and-engineers/articleshow/119183032.cms,"Potential impact of wage hikes:



Concerns for employers and workers:



Policy challenges:



A new study warns that proposed wage mandates for H-1B visa holders could make it harder for US companies to hire skilled foreign workers, particularly scientists and engineers. The research, conducted by the National Foundation for American Policy (NFAP), highlights concern over a proposal that would require employers to pay H-1B professionals significantly above current market rates.The proposed wage changes, including a requirement to pay at least the ""median local wage,"" could price many skilled foreign graduates out of the job market. The report suggests that instead of creating more opportunities for U.S. workers, the mandates could push companies to move jobs offshore.A recent amendment by Senator. Bernie Sanders to the Laken Riley Act will result in raising wages for H-1B workers by as much as 72% in some cases. For example, a newly graduated software developer in San Jose would have needed to be paid over $80,000 more per year than under current law. The Senate did not vote on the amendment, but similar measures could be debated as Congress considers immigration reforms.NFAP argues that the ""median local wage"" does not reflect real-world pay structures, especially for entry-level workers. In many professions, median wages are based on individuals with over a decade of experience. Requiring employers to pay such rates to all H-1B workers could make it financially unfeasible to hire recent graduates or early-career professionals.NFAP notes that about 70% of full-time graduate students in fields like electrical engineering and computer science at U.S. universities are international students. The research suggests that proposed amendments on wages which would make hiring challenging would drive away top talent and weaken the US workforce in key industries, such as artificial intelligence and semiconductor engineering.The study also raises fairness concerns, suggesting that requiring employers to pay foreign-born recent graduates significantly more than U.S. workers with greater experience could lead to legal challenges.Similar wage mandates proposed during the earlier Trump administration were struck down in court for violating administrative rules. NFAP warns that if Congress moves forward with new wage mandates, it could have similar negative effects, including fewer job opportunities for skilled foreign graduates and increased outsourcing by U.S. companies.As discussions on immigration reform continue, policymakers will have to weigh the impact of wage mandates on employers, workers, and the broader economy. The NFAP study suggests that imposing inflated wage requirements on H-1B visa holders could do more harm than good, potentially weakening the US position as a global leader in technology and innovation.","Proposed wage mandates for h-1b visa holders could make it harder for us companies to hire skilled foreign workers. National foundation for american policy: mandates could push companies to move jobs offshore. Study also raises fairness concerns, suggesting that requiring employers to pay foreign-born recent graduates significantly more could lead to legal challenges.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-119183020,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-55412,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Sowjanya journeys from chip design to podcasts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/times-techies/sowjanya-journeys-from-chip-design-to-podcasts/articleshow/119187024.cms,"Sowjanya Shetty began her career as a chip designer, but now does podcasts . The transition from pure tech to media did not take the techie out of her. She continues to write Python codes to refine her research, which is used in making her podcasts.Her journey with tech began as a young girl sitting in her mother’s office. After the demise of her father, Sowjanya’s mother got a job in HR at Bharat Electronics Ltd (BEL). Being in the learning and development team, her mother worked with top researchers at the firm. Sowjanya would talk to these researchers when she visited the office.Without even realising it, she says she picked up a lot of the basic concepts of engineering . She had access to books and journals on microprocessors , monthly newsletters, and magazines at BEL. She would make notes just to remember what she had read. Those science notes went viral in her network. Many started buying them. Even in college, all her juniors were fans of her notes for the systematic way they were arranged. Sowjanya started making money by selling these notes.She also spent some time assembling computers, and that is how Sowjanya learnt about RAM cards. She was curious to know anything and everything about tech.Soon, she finished her engineering from M Visvesvaraya Institute of Technology in Bengaluru and joined BEL as a chip designer. Real learning began only much later. In the late 90s, Sowjanya moved to the US with her husband. She got a job at a startup, which shut down overnight, leaving her with 60 days to find a new job to save her H-1B status. Sowjanya took up a job as a sales personnel, which involved talking a lot. This was completely opposite to her personality.“Like all techies, I was an introvert. We tend to talk a lot about technologies we know. Conversations end with that. We are unable to embrace what we do not know. Being on the sales side meant talking to people about everything. This experience helped me as I took on a manager’s role later on, after returning to India,” Sowjanya says. She learnt to be a good communicator.Working in sales also taught her that enhancing general knowledge by reading up on geopolitical events and other issues is important to do well in life. “When you know what is happening around the world, it becomes easy to plan ahead,” she says.Life had other plans for her once she returned to India. Sowjanya joined HP and was in charge of HP’s network card, which goes into printers. Soon, they offered her a role as a program coordinator, a role that was in the US, but which the company wanted to transition to India. “For that role, they told me to think like a CEO,” she says. To understand what that entails, she started a gifting venture called Bubblewrap, even as she continued in her existing role at HP. “I wanted to experience and understand what it meant to be a CEO,” she recalls. She succeeded eventually in getting the program coordinator role.Bubblewrap did not last long, and Sowjanya went on to have stints as CRM leader at GE Digital and sales director at Microsoft. She quit Microsoft three years ago, and since then has been doing podcasts focused on building careers and changing mindsets.","Sowjanya shetty began her career as a chip designer, but now does podcasts.

‘We cannot be complacent about AI’s impact on us’: Preparing for the future,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/times-techies/we-cannot-be-complacent-about-ais-impact-on-us-preparing-for-the-future/articleshow/119186832.cms,"Avoid fatalism



The economic stakes of AI’s rapid transformation are immense, yet curiously uncertain. Current forecasts for AI’s impact on productivity range from a modest 0.05% to doubledigits. This variance itself presents a risk: how does one adequately prepare for a technology whose economic impact remains so disputed?“Economists have wideranging estimates,” says Ronnie Chatterji, OpenAI’s chief economist, who is in New Delhi for the Raisina Dialogue and to catch up with policymakers and technologists here. “And that’s because we’re very early in understanding this technology.”As the first economist to join the organisation behind ChatGPT, Chatterji’s perspective carries particular weight – especially when he notes that AI’s capabilities are “moving really fast, faster than any technology I’ve seen.” This acceleration leaves little room for leisurely adaptation or passive observation.“It’s hard to get that balance right,” Chatterji admits, discussing the fine line between alarmism and complacency. “While I want to caution people that overnight change doesn’t seem likely given what we know about technology in the past, that doesn’t mean we should sit back and wait.” The danger, Chatterji says, lies in assuming AI will follow the gradual adoption patterns of previous technologies. ChatGPT reached 100 million users in just two months, a pace that shatters historical precedent.Companies are already reporting significant time savings. Yet, focusing solely on these immediate efficiency gains would be dangerously short-sighted. “What are people doing in that time they’ve saved?” Chatterji asks rhetorically. The true economic impact of a tech emerges from fundamental transformations it brings in how work is conceived and executed.“Think about a scientist who can approach her discovery differently because she has AI helping her determine what problems to solve,” he illustrates. “She will create things she did not create before. Measuring that is more than just time savings – it’s the impact of something entirely new on the economy.”Those assuming AI merely automates existing functions miss this profound potential for innovation, he says. This misunderstanding fosters complacency about both opportunities and disruptions on the horizon.India’s storied information technology sector illustrates this tension. Some predict that Indian IT companies might face extinction through automation. Chatterji rejects such fatalism while still stressing the need for proactive adaptation.Indian firms, he says, have a long history of figuring out and adopting different tools, from the BPO days to the rise of product firms. “The idea that these changes will happen overnight is less concerning to me. What worries me more is that we become completely complacent and don’t study these developments as they’re happening,” he says.This concern extends beyond corporate strategy to workforce preparation. Professional services providers already demonstrate how AI transforms job functions rather than simply eliminating them. Consultants increasingly delegate fundamental research tasks and document preparation to AI, allowing greater focus on relationshipbuilding and client interaction. “The key thing is the client relationship,” Chatterji notes. “That’s where you actually drive value.”Likewise, in software development, more autonomous AI may actually build code on its own. “But a human will still need to verify that it meets requirements, and this will also free up time for other things in the enterprise. You might see developers taking on business and leadership roles, managing larger teams.”So, the danger lies not in immediate job extinction but in failing to anticipate and prepare for these shifts.India, Chatterji says, appears relatively well-positioned for this transition. “You are producing over a million STEM graduates annually, a young population that can more easily acquire new skills, and diverse datasets across 22 official languages that are crucial for developing inclusive AI models. Add to this India’s vibrant startup ecosystem and growing infrastructure investments, and you have the ingredients needed to thrive in the intelligence age.”","Current forecasts for ai’s impact on productivity range from a modest 0.05% to doubledigits.

Ranjani Srinivasan managed to escape ICE raid, left country



President Donald Trump was seen promoting the Homeland Security Department's CBP Home app in a new video as his administration is sending people back to their countries of origin. The CBP app was launched for deportation on March 11 and Kristi Noem, the secretary of the department claimed that Ranjani Srinivasan, an Indian-origin Columbia student, self-deported herself using the app soon after. Though Srinivasan's lawyers challenged the claim and said that there was no truth in Noem's claim, the CBP app is in the news. And now the president is advertising for it.“People in our country illegally can self-deport the easy way, or they can get deported the hard way and that’s not pleasant,” Trump said.Calling it the safest option for illegal migrants, Trump said if people use the CBP Home app to voluntarily deport, they could have the opportunity to potentially return legally at some point in the future. But, if they are found and deported, the option to come back to the US will no longer be available.“The CBP Home app is now available free across all mobile app stores, and I encourage those who have violated our laws to use this option,” the president said in the video. “Today, do it right, and come back into our country. Do it wrong, and you’ll never be back again.”Ranjani Srinivasan, an Indian national and doctoral student in Urban Planning at Columbia University, deported herself after her visa was revoked on March 5 because of her alleged support to Hamas. She said she did not attend any protest on the campus and was caught in the crosshairs of one protest because of which she was arrested last year, but was released immediately.Following her student visa revocation, Columbia University canceled her enrollment, leaving her with nothing to do in the US. On March 11, she left the country and went to Canada.

In some relief for the common man, the cost of a home-cooked vegetarian thali declined year-on-year in February, according to CRISIL’s latest monthly indicator of food plate cost, RRR (Roti Rice Rate).
