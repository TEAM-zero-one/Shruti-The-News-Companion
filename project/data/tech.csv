IAF’s Rafale-Led Flypast Caps Republic Day With A Global Showcase Of India’s Military Strength

NEW DELHI: Rubbishing speculation of possible delays in the delivery of the first batch of indigenous LCA Mk1A fighter jets to IAF, Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) on Thursday said that “five LCA Mk1A aircraft are fully ready for delivery, incorporating major contracted capabilities in accordance with the agreed specifications”.HAL also said that “an additional nine aircraft have already been built and flown. Upon receipt of engines from General Electric (US company), these aircraft will be made ready for delivery”. “All design and development issues identified are being addressed in an expedited manner. HAL is in active discussions with IAF to deliver the aircraft at the earliest,” it said in a statement.HAL has received five engines from GE as on date. The supply position from GE is positive, and the future delivery outlook aligns with HAL’s delivery plans, the company said. HAL assured that it will meet the guidance projected for the current financial year.Besides LCA Mk1A aircraft, the company said it is simultaneously advancing multiple strategic programmes, including Indian Multi Role Helicopter (IMRH), Tejas LCA Mk2 and Combat Air Teaming System (CATS), all of which are expected to enter production after 2032.HAL had received the first contract from IAF for 83 LCA Mk1A jets (73 fighters and 10 trainers) in Feb 2021, and later, a follow-on contract in Sept 2025 for 97 additional LCA Mk1A aircraft (68 fighters and 29 twin-seaters) at a cost of over Rs 62,370 crore.The delivery of these aircraft would commence during 2027-28 and be completed over a period of six years.The aircraft would have an indigenous content of over 64%, with 67 additional items incorporated. In all, IAF had ordered 180 of these aircraft in two tranches.Some of the planes were supposed to be delivered last year, but IAF insisted that HAL provide the aircraft in a fully operational configuration. On Oct 17 last year, the company conducted the first flight of the first Tejas Mk1A prototype from its Nashik facility. At present, HAL’s fighter aircraft production capacity stands at 24 aircraft per year. At this rate, fulfilling the 180 aircraft Tejas Mk1A order would take over seven years, with IAF expected to receive the complete fleet no earlier than around 2033.Beyond the 180 Mk1A jets, IAF had previously acquired 40 LCA Mk1 (IOC/FOC variants), making a total of 220 LCA-type aircraft contracted or ordered across all variants.","Hal has received five engines from ge as on date.

Explained: Why India-EU 'Mother Of All Deals' Matters As Trade Talks Enter Final High Stakes Phase

NEW DELHI: Amid opposition allegations over the India-US trade deal, Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Thursday said that the agreement fully safeguards India’s agricultural interests, particularly those of the farm and dairy sectors.Underlining that India’s staple grains, fruits, major crops, millets and dairy products remain completely secure and face no threat whatsoever, Chouhan emphasised that the interests of small and large farmers alike have been fully protected and that the agreement will create fresh opportunities rather than risks for Indian agriculture.Highlighting the export potential unlocked by the agreement, Chouhan, while addressing the media on the issue, noted that India already exports rice to many countries, including the US, and has recently recorded exports worth around Rs 63,000 crore.He said that reduced tariffs will directly benefit India’s rice, spices and textile exports, and that growth in textile exports will help millions of cotton-growing farmers.On certain concerns over an adverse impact of the deal on small farmers, the minister stressed that no sudden or disruptive entry of foreign products into the Indian market will take place.On the confusion triggered by a recent social media post by the US treasury secretary about increased access for American farm products, Chouhan said commerce minister Piyush Goyal has already clarified the facts in Parliament. He reiterated that India has not opened its markets in any way that puts pressure on domestic farmers & that the protections for key agricultural commodities remain intact.“Farmers are our ‘Annadata’, the providers of life. Their welfare is nation’s welfare, and their interests are absolutely secure,” he added.","Union agriculture minister shivraj singh chouhan said that the agreement fully safeguards india’s agricultural interests.

Planning to visit a bank in February? It’s smart to check the holiday schedule first, as an unexpected closure can turn a quick errand into a wasted trip. In India, banks observe both national and state-specific holidays, so closure dates may differ from one region to another. In India, bank holidays include both national and state-specific observances, so closure dates can vary across different regions.Banks will remain closed in Sikkim on account of the Losar festival.Banks will be closed in Maharashtra for Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Jayanti.Banks will not operate in Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh in observance of State Day/Statehood Day.Apart from these, banks will also remain closed on second and fourth Saturdays of the month, according to RBI.Being aware of bank holidays in advance can help customers plan essential financial transactions and avoid last-minute hassles. While branches may remain closed on these days, it does not prevent customers from carrying out routine transactions. Digital banking services, including online banking, ATMs, mobile apps, and UPI, remain fully operational for fund transfers, bill payments, and other regular activities.However, services that require a physical visit such as large cash deposits, cheque clearances, or issuing demand drafts will not be available.

New labour code changes and why companies are making one-time provisions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-labour-code-changes-and-why-companies-are-making-one-time-provisions/articleshow/127929310.cms,"1.

MUMBAI: Most companies reporting their financial results for Q3FY26 are reporting a large one-time provison towards employee benefits attributing it to the new labour code. TOI takes a look at what brought about these changes and how does it affect stakeholders.The change relates mainly to gratuity payments under the Code on Social Security, 2020. The new rules redefine “wages” for calculating gratuity and expand eligibility for fixed-term employees.Under the revised rules, wages used to calculate gratuity must form at least 50% of an employee’s total cost-to-company (CTC). If allowances exceed 50% of CTC, the excess must be added back to wages for gratuity calculation. This increases the base on which gratuity is calculated.The law also allows fixed-term employees to become eligible for gratuity after completing one year of service instead of the earlier five-year requirement. Because of these changes, companies must account for higher future gratuity payouts, forcing them to create one-time provisions in their financial statements.The government introduced the change through the Code on Social Security, 2020, which forms part of four consolidated labour codes replacing 29 older labour laws.The codes were passed by Parliament in 2020, but detailed implementation rules were notified later.The reform aimed to simplify labour laws, improve social security coverage and reflect modern employment practices. A key concern was that many companies structured salaries with a low basic pay and high allowances to reduce statutory payouts such as provident fund and gratuity. The new definition of wages reduces this flexibility.Another trigger was the growing use of fixed-term employment across industries. The government sought to extend social security benefits to such workers, especially in sectors with high attrition and contractual hiring.The new labour codes, including the Social Security Code, came into force on November 21, 2025. While the central framework became effective from that date, states continue to finalise detailed implementation rules.Employees benefit mainly through higher gratuity payouts and wider eligibility. Because gratuity calculations now use a broader wage base, many employees will receive higher retirement or exit benefits.Fixed-term employees, who earlier did not qualify unless they completed five years of service, can now receive gratuity after one year. This benefits workers in sectors with short-term or project-based employment.The changes also aim to bring more transparency to salary structures and expand social security coverage.The financial impact varies depending on salary structure and workforce composition.Manufacturing and heavy industries: These sectors rely heavily on contract and fixed-term workers. The new rules increase gratuity liabilities and could push companies to review workforce models.Technology and IT services: These companies often use allowance-heavy salary structures. They may need to restructure compensation to meet the wage definition norms.Banking and financial services: The sector may see higher statutory benefit costs and increased liabilities for outsourced and contractual staff.Construction: The sector employs a large informal workforce. The new rules increase compliance requirements and settlement obligations.Retail and e-commerce: Companies with seasonal hiring and gig-based employment may face higher employee benefit costs and classification challenges.Healthcare: Round-the-clock operations and contract staffing could raise wage and benefit compliance costs.Manufacturing and heavy industries are expected to make the largest one-time provisions. These sectors typically have a large contract workforce, lower basic salary structures and higher dependence on fixed-term employment, which significantly increases gratuity liabilities.Technology and financial services companies are also likely to see sizeable increases due to changes in salary structure norms, though typically less than manufacturing.","Most companies reporting their financial results for q3fy26 are reporting a large one-time provison towards employee benefits.

Viewbotting claims grow as TheBurntPeanut’s Twitch numbers explode

“normie”

“more dead than someone with under 500 viewers.”





Twitch streamer TheBurntPeanut is facing growing scrutiny online after a sudden and massive jump in viewership raised questions across social media. Over the past few months, the streamer has averaged more than 55,000 viewers per broadcast, with some streams peaking close to 90,000 viewers. The numbers have drawn attention not just because of their size, but because of how quickly they appeared, leading many users on X and Reddit to accuse him of viewbotting.These accusations are aimed at the claim that TheBurntPeanut is somehow using bots in order to inflate viewer count artificially, which would fall into a serious allegation in the streaming world. Critics argue that this growth does not necessarily match normal audience behavior. While no proof was given, the debate has become one of the most talked-about topics on streamer timelines.TheBurntPeanut is known for streaming games like ARC Raiders and Escape from Tarkov, and his recent success has been linked to strong performance on YouTube Shorts and other social platforms. Supporters say his short-form content helped him reach a wider, more casual audience, often referred to as thespace. They believe this explains the sudden rise in viewers without any wrongdoing.However, skeptics argue that they notice unusual patterns within his viewership. There are instances where people have pointed out streams where the number of viewers suddenly increased tremendously over a very short time from as few as zero to tens of thousands. Some people also argue that there is very little activity in his Twitch chat compared to other streams, which are much less viewed compared to his content. Just as someone said about him, the chat isDiscussions comparing the situation to past Escape from Tarkov streamer controversies have also fueled the fire. Viewbotting has been a recurring issue on Twitch for years, and past incidents have made the community quick to question sudden success stories. Still, it is important to note that no official action or statement has been made by Twitch regarding TheBurntPeanut.As it stands, the allegations are unproven, based largely on conjecture and observation online. TheBurntPeanut has not issued any public statement about the claims, and his streams remain incredibly popular. Until there is something said by Twitch or the streamer himself, the debate is sure to continue just another case of how success on the platform can easily swing into controversy.","Twitch streamer theburntpeanut is facing growing scrutiny online after a sudden and massive jump in viewership raised questions across social media.

Anthropic AI: Explained: What is Anthropic's AI tool that wiped $285 billion off software stocks in a single day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/explained-what-is-anthropics-ai-tool-that-wiped-285-billion-off-software-stocks-in-a-single-day/articleshow/127892310.cms,"What exactly did Anthropic release

Why the market panic over a folder of prompts

What does this mean for the software industry going forward

Anthropic's newly launched AI plugins have triggered what analysts are calling a 'SaaSpocalypse'—a brutal selloff that wiped out roughly $285 billion from software, legal tech and financial services stocks in a single trading session. The AI developer, known for its Claude chatbot, released 11 open-source plugins for its Claude Cowork tool on Friday, January 30. One of them targets legal workflows, and that alone was enough to send investors running for the exits.Thomson Reuters dropped over 15%. RELX, owner of LexisNexis, fell 14%. LegalZoom got hammered nearly 20%. A Goldman Sachs basket tracking US software stocks posted its worst single-day decline since April's tariff-driven selloff. The Nasdaq fell 1.4%, with ripple effects extending to Indian IT giants—Infosys ADRs slipped 5.5% and Wipro fell nearly 5%.Claude Cowork is an agentic AI assistant that Anthropic launched earlier in January. Think of it as Claude Code—the company's developer-focused coding tool—but redesigned for non-technical professionals. It can read files, organise folders, draft documents and carry out multi-step tasks with user consent.The plugins announced last Friday supercharge this capability. They let companies tailor Claude to specific job functions by specifying how work should be done, which tools and data to pull from, and what workflows to automate. Anthropic open-sourced 11 starter plugins covering productivity, sales, marketing, finance, data analysis, customer support, product management and biology research.But it was the legal plugin that spooked markets. It automates contract review, NDA triage, compliance checks and legal briefings. Anthropic was careful to note that all outputs should be reviewed by licensed attorneys and that the tool does not provide legal advice. That disclaimer did little to calm investors.Here's the thing that has caught many observers off guard: the legal plugin is essentially a set of prompts and configurations. There's no proprietary model fine-tuned on case law, no special legal reasoning engine. It's Claude being Claude, but with structured workflow instructions.The real signal, analysts say, is that Anthropic has moved from selling the model to owning the workflow. When Claude was just an API, companies like Thomson Reuters could build on top of it. Thomson Reuters literally runs CoCounsel on OpenAI. But when Anthropic starts publishing ready-made vertical solutions, the platform becomes the competitor.Jefferies dubbed the selloff a 'SaaSpocalypse', noting that investor sentiment has shifted dramatically. The narrative used to be that AI helps software companies. Now it's that AI replaces them. 'Trading is very much get-me-out style selling,' said Jeffrey Favuzza from Jefferies' equity trading desk. The brokerage also noted that OpenAI appears to be losing ground in the corporate market to Anthropic's Claude, with enterprises now accounting for 80% of Anthropic's business.Not everyone is convinced the panic is justified. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called the selloff 'the most illogical thing in the world,' arguing that AI will use existing software tools, not replace them. 'Would you use a screwdriver or invent a new screwdriver?' he said at a Cisco event. Google CEO Sundar Pichai echoed the sentiment during the company's earnings call, suggesting the scramble was overblown and that companies 'seizing the moment' with AI would find opportunity, not obsolescence.The damage extended well beyond legal tech. DocuSign fell 11%, Salesforce dropped nearly 7%, Adobe slid 7%, and ServiceNow declined 7%. Business development companies with exposure to software loans also got caught in the selling. Blue Owl Capital Corp fell 13%, marking a record ninth consecutive decline.Anthropic isn't the only player in legal AI. Startups like Harvey AI (valued at $5 billion) and Legora ($1.8 billion valuation) have been developing tools for years. But Anthropic's advantage is that it builds its own underlying models. Firms like Legora rely on models from developers like Anthropic, which means Claude's creator can potentially disrupt both traditional legal services and the startups trying to disrupt them.The company's growth trajectory underscores why investors are taking this threat seriously. Claude Code hit $1 billion in annualised recurring revenue by November, just months after its May launch. Anthropic is now reportedly raising $20 billion at a $350 billion valuation—up sharply from $61.5 billion in March 2025.The iteration speed is also striking. Cowork launched on January 12. The plugins dropped less than three weeks later. Enterprise software companies typically spend quarters on such releases.For software executives watching the carnage unfold, the takeaway is uncomfortable but clear: Anthropic didn't need a breakthrough product to rattle markets. It just needed to show what Claude could already do—and hit publish.","Anthropic released 11 open-source plugins for its claude cowork tool on friday, january 30.thomson reuters dropped over 15%.

I emphasised that every driver associated with this cooperative taxi will have ownership, and it will work for their welfare,” he added.Customers can hail cars, three-wheelers and two-wheelers through the platform, and Bharat Taxi will compete with players like Uber, Ola and Rapido.Bharat Taxi operates on a zero-commission and surge-free pricing model with direct profit distribution among drivers, positioning the platform as an indigenous alternative to foreign investment-based ride-hailing platforms.According to the ministry, Bharat Taxi has emerged as the world's first and largest cooperative-based ride-hailing platform, and the world's largest driver-owned mobility platform.According to news agency PTI, over 3 lakh drivers have joined the platform since the launch of its pilot programme, and more than 1 lakh users have registered. Further, more than 10,000 rides have been completed daily in Delhi-NCR and Gujarat.Around Rs 10 crore has been distributed directly to drivers so far. The drivers are called 'Sarathis', and the platform is said to prioritise social security for drivers through health insurance, accident insurance, retirement savings and a dedicated support system. Support centres operate at seven locations in Delhi.",Amit shah says profits will be shared with drivers associated with bharat taxi. The service has been initially launched in delhi-ncr and gujarat. It will be expanded across all states and union territories within three years.

GURGAON: A wedding video of popular Haryana-based automobile YouTuber Arun Panwar has triggered a heated debate on dowry and social responsibility after visuals surfaced showing large amounts of cash and gold being presented during wedding rituals, even as the gifts were described as “daan” (donation) and not dowry.Panwar, a resident of Gurugram and originally from Indri village in Sohna, is going to get married to Dr Tithi. Wedding ceremonies held on January 30 sparked criticism.In a reel uploaded on Panwar’s Instagram account, a person is seen reading out a detailed list of items allegedly given as “daan”. The narration mentions, “Ladke ki chain saade paanch tole ki,” followed by a list that includes a 4 tola bracelet, two gold rings for engagement and marriage, jewellery for the groom’s father, uncle, brothers, mother, sister-in-law and the bride’s sister. The video further claims that a total of 21 tolas of gold and Rs 71 lakh in cash were given.The video quickly went viral, drawing sharp criticism from social media users who questioned whether influencers were normalising dowry under the guise of tradition. “Are influencers now promoting dowry?” one user asked. Another commented, “We live in a society where all of this is applauded. No wonder we’re so doomed.” Some users even questioned why no legal action had been taken if such practices were being displayed publicly.A particularly pointed comment noted that the bride is a highly educated doctor, saying it was disturbing that such practices continued even when the woman involved is professionally accomplished.Arun Panwar began his YouTube career in 2019 and is known for automobile-related content such as car reviews, mileage tests, feature breakdowns and ownership experiences.He holds a BCA degree and has built a strong digital presence, with over 2.4 million subscribers on YouTube and around one million followers on Instagram.A car enthusiast, Panwar owns several premium vehicles, including a Kia Seltos, Ford Endeavour, Toyota Fortuner and Mahindra Thar.The viral wedding video has once again brought the issue of dowry into focus, raising questions about the role of social media influencers and whether rebranding such exchanges as “gifts” or “donations” can obscure practices that are legally prohibited and socially contested.",Haryana youtuber arun pawar's wedding raises eyebrows on social media.

Jaxson Dart and Marissa Ayers make a statement at NFL Honours

New York Giants QB Jaxson Dart found himself in a different kind of limelight at the 2026 NFL Honors in San Francisco, stepping onto the red carpet with Marissa Ayers. The moment quickly caught attention, marking a notable offseason move for the young QB as cameras followed the pair all night.While Dart’s rookie season already put him on the national radar, this stunning appearance added another twist to his profile. Calm, confident, and clearly comfortable, the New York Giants signal-caller shared the moment with Marissa Ayers, keeping details minimal but presence unmistakable.Jaxson Dart and Marissa Ayers didn’t need any medium to steal the show. Their red carpet entry was polished and understated, drawing eyes without trying too hard. Ayers’ stunning metallic golden gown matched perfectly with Dart’s clean, classic dark suit, creating one of the evening's more talked-about entrances.The appearance also hinted at a relationship that has gradually become more visible over recent months. The lovebirds have already gained more attention with their viral Instagram post, in which Ayers took a mirror selfie with the QB and captioned it, “rumour has it.”And Dart reacted to it, which confirmed their relationship.Big Blue’s star player revealed her importance in an interview with People, “I think that just in the world that we live in, we try to keep as much as we can, you know, between us,” and added that he is “grateful for her and the time and how much we’ve been able to build this connection.”From subtle social media moments to public outings, the two have moved at their own pace, letting moments speak rather than statements. NFL Honours became the biggest stage yet.Star-QB Jaxson Dart’s rookie season gave Big Blue fans reasons for optimism. He finished the season with 2,275 passing yards, 15 TDs, and just 5 interceptions, while adding crucial value as a runner. His ability to extend plays and stay composed under pressure quickly earned league-wide respect.Even though the champ lost the AP Offensive Rookie of the Year award to McMillan, he still won in life with Marissa Ayers by his side.","New york giants qb jaxson dart and marissa ayers stole the show at nfl honors in san francisco.

The company that wiped off nearly $300 billion from software stocks in one day releases new AI model,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/the-company-that-wiped-off-nearly-300-billion-from-software-stocks-in-one-day-releases-new-ai-model/articleshow/127968173.cms,"Anthropic launched Claude Opus 4.6 just days after its AI tools triggered a massive sell-off in software stocks. The new model brings agent teams, a 1 million token context window, and stronger performance in legal and financial tasks—the very areas that spooked Wall Street. Enterprise software investors are watching closely as the AI race reshapes the workplace.

A legal plugin that spooked Wall Street

Opus 4.6 doubles down on exactly what spooked investors

Not everyone's buying the doom narrative

Anthropic, the AI startup whose workplace tool triggered a massive sell-off in software stocks earlier this week, has launched Claude Opus 4.6—its most powerful model yet. The timing couldn't be more loaded.The new model, announced Thursday, brings stronger coding abilities, a 1 million token context window (up from 200,000), and a feature called ""agent teams"" that lets multiple AI agents split tasks and work in parallel. Think of it as a virtual engineering squad that coordinates on its own. Opus 4.6 also supports outputs of up to 128,000 tokens, meaning it can handle much larger tasks without needing to break them into multiple requests.On benchmarks, the model outperforms OpenAI's GPT-5.2 on GDPval-AA, an evaluation of real-world knowledge work in finance, legal and other professional domains—precisely the sectors that just saw their stocks crater because of Anthropic's earlier product update. It also tops every other frontier model on BrowseComp, which measures a model's ability to dig up hard-to-find information online.Here's the backstory. Last Friday, Anthropic released a set of open-source plugins for Claude Cowork, its AI assistant built for non-coders.Most covered standard business functions like sales and marketing. But one plugin, designed to automate contract reviews, NDA triage and legal briefings, sent shockwaves through the market.Thomson Reuters fell nearly 16% on Tuesday. LegalZoom crashed close to 20%. A Goldman Sachs basket of US software stocks dropped 6% in a single session—the worst since April. By the time the dust began to settle on Wednesday, roughly $830 billion had been wiped from the S&P 500 software and services index since January 28. Traders started calling it the ""SaaSpocalypse.""The fear wasn't just about legal tech. Investors saw Anthropic muscling into the enterprise application layer, threatening the subscription-based business models that power companies like Salesforce, Intuit and Adobe. Private equity firms with heavy software portfolios also took hits—Ares Management, KKR and Blue Owl Capital all dropped more than 9% in a single day.Now, with Opus 4.6, Anthropic is making its AI even better at the kind of work that triggered the panic. The model produces documents, spreadsheets and presentations that are closer to ""production-ready"" on the first try, the company says. It handles financial modelling, regulatory filings and long-form research with less hand-holding.Harvey, the legal AI startup, reported that Opus 4.6 scored 90.2% on its BigLaw Bench evaluation—the highest of any Claude model. Box said its testing showed a 10% lift in performance on multi-source analysis across legal, financial and technical content.Anthropic also introduced Claude in PowerPoint as a research preview, letting users build and edit slide decks directly within the app. The AI reads layouts, fonts and slide masters to stay on brand—a feature available on Max, Team and Enterprise plans.Scott White, Anthropic's head of product, told CNBC that the company is entering a ""vibe working"" era, where non-developers can hand real, significant work to AI. Enterprise customers already make up roughly 80% of Anthropic's business.Not everyone thinks the sky is falling. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang called the software sell-off ""the most illogical thing in the world,"" arguing AI will use existing tools rather than replace them. Google's Sundar Pichai struck a similar tone during his company's earnings call, saying companies that ""seize the moment"" will find the same opportunities ahead.But the market isn't fully convinced. Claude Opus 4.6 is available today on claude.ai, Anthropic's API and all major cloud platforms. Pricing stays at $5/$25 per million tokens. Whether it calms investors or spooks them further is the real test.","Anthropic launched claude opus 4.6 just days after its ai tools triggered a massive sell-off in software stocks.

Oracle's Larry Ellison has lost almost $50 billion this year in less than forty days,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/oracles-larry-ellison-has-lost-almost-50-billion-this-year-in-less-than-forty-days/articleshow/127967875.cms,"Ellison was not alone other tech leaders also hit hard

Oracle’s risky AI bet

Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison has now seen an unprecedented $50 billion wiped off his net worth in less than forty days this year, as per Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Ellison’s fortune stood at $199 billion by Wednesday’s (February 4) close, down sharply from $247 billion at the start of January. A single-day slump of 5% in Oracle’s stock erased about $9 billion from this wealth, deepening the decline.The round in software stocks was triggered by Anthropic’s release of plugins for its Claude Cowork AI agent, which can easily automate corporate tasks in legal, scales, finance, marketing and data analysis. Investors now fear that such tools could lead to reduction in the demand for external software from established giants such as Adobe, Salesforce, Intuit and Atlassian. Shares of all these companies tumbled earlier this week before staging a particle rebound, but Oracle’s loses remained steep.Ellison was not along in facing the sharp decline in net worth. Along with him, Tesla CEO Elon Musk also saw his net worth fall by around $11 billion, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg lost around $8 billion. On the other hand, other tech leaders like Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Jeff Bezos and Jensen Huang each shed around $5 billion as the stocks of the companies dropped by at least 2%.For those unaware, Oracle has aggressively positioned itself as an important player in the AI boom, the company has signed deals with Nvidia and OpenAI in order to offer data centers powering next-generation technology. However, its heavy spending and increasing debt have raised concerns among analysts. The company’s remaining performance obligations — contracted sales not yet recognized as revenue — surged 438% year-over-year to $523 billion as of November 30, nearly ten times its annual revenue of $53 billion.Critics believe that Oracle may be overspending. Popular American investor Michael Burry has publicly bet against Oracle. Burry has warned that the company’s debt-fueled expansion tied to AI contracts was unnecessary, calling the moves “hard to explain” and suggesting that “ego” might be driving decisions.","Ellison's fortune stood at $199 billion by wednesday’s (february 4) close, down sharply from $247 billion at the start of january.

KSI admits he was “washed” on YouTube after struggling to hit one million views,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/ksi-admits-he-was-washed-on-youtube-after-struggling-to-hit-one-million-views/articleshow/127955109.cms,"Image Via Instagram

“broke”

“fallen off”

KSI reflects on falling off before making a late YouTube comeback

“hardly even breaking a million views.”

“washed”





KSI has openly admitted that he went through a rough period on YouTube after failing to consistently reach one million views on his uploads. The British creator, whose real name is JJ Olatunji, said the struggle became clear during the second half of 2025, when his numbers dipped far below what fans had come to expect. Once one of the platform’s biggest stars, KSI explained that the drop in views made him question his position on YouTube, even as his profile outside the platform continued to grow.The comments came during a conversation sparked by leaked analytics shared online, which showed KSI earning around $100,000 from a month of YouTube work. While many would see that as strong income, KSI said the figures fueled criticism, with people calling himby creator standards. He admitted there was some truth to the jokes, at least when it came to YouTube performance, and said he felt like he hadbefore deciding to take the platform seriously again.KSI explained that June 2025 was the turning point when he realized he needed to refocus on YouTube. Before that, he said his content was underperforming badly, with videosFor a creator who helped shape early British YouTube through FIFA content and later found success with The Sidemen, the slump was hard to accept. He described himself asduring that period, admitting that his effort and output were not where they needed to be.Despite this setback, KSI was never completely absent from YouTube. With the rise of music, new brands such as Prime and Lunchly, and conventional television programs such as Britain's Got Talent, KSI continued to upload content on all his channels. He, however, was aware that having too much to do could have adversely impacted his progress.Since his recommitment in mid-2025, the results have been improving gradually. This is so because the average views of his video on his main KSI channel have gotten better by surging past the one million mark. Although, his other channel, referred to as KSI+, remained just below this figure, indicating that the artist is still working on his comeback.KSI’s sincerity has struck a chord with many of his fans, bringing an unprecedented glimpse of the difficulties faced by YouTube veterans in keeping themselves relevant. His words emphasize the need for YouTube personalities to stay relevant in terms of numbers, experiences, and the ephemeral nature of success on the platform, even for its earliest pioneers.","Ksi has openly admitted that he went through a rough period on youtube after failing to consistently reach one million views on his uploads.

Saudi Arabia has introduced a new digital and regulatory system designed to bring order, traceability and credibility to the camel sector, marking a significant step in how the animals are identified, traded and managed across the Kingdom.The Camel Passport initiative, launched on Tuesday, creates an official identity for every registered camel, linking ownership, health records and breed information into a single, recognised framework that supports regulation, veterinary services and market credibility.The project was inaugurated by Deputy Minister of Environment, Water and Agriculture Mansour Al-Mushaiti and is part of the ministry’s work under the National Program for the Development of the Livestock and Fisheries Sector.According to the ministry, the initiative aims to unify regulatory and digital systems across the camel sector. By formally documenting camel data, ownership details, breeds and health records, it establishes an authorised reference that can be used for veterinary response, regulatory oversight and transparent market operations.The camel passport functions as a comprehensive identification document, ensuring that each animal can be accurately verified and tracked.It includes the following details:Additionally, the passport includes a dedicated vaccination record. This section documents veterinary immunisations and is officially certified with the name, signature and stamp of the attending veterinarian.The ministry said the initiative will play a central role in regulating sales and trading activities within the camel market. It will organise transport procedures, ownership transfers and official documentation, helping protect owners’ rights while increasing trust among buyers, sellers and other market participants.By creating a verified record for each camel, the system is expected to reduce disputes, improve traceability and bring greater clarity to commercial transactions.The camel passport is also expected to enhance the market value of camels by allowing pricing to be based on accurate and verifiable data, including health status, breed and lineage. This is expected to increase transparency in both local and international auctions.Beyond trade, the project will support strategic planning by generating reliable data on camel populations, broken down by age, gender, breed and colour. The ministry said this information will help guide national livestock distribution, improve breeding efficiency through genetic performance analysis and support programmes aimed at improving local camel breeds.Together, these measures position the camel passport as a foundational tool for modernising the sector while preserving its economic and cultural importance in Saudi Arabia.","Saudi arabia launched a digital camel passport system to document ownership, health records and trade.

"Is Trump's Gold Card illegal? Lawsuit says scientists, engineers waiting in queues while the rich get entry",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-trumps-gold-card-illegal-lawsuit-says-scientists-engineers-waiting-in-queues-while-the-rich-gets-entry/articleshow/127917594.cms,"Who qualifies for EB-1, EB-2 visas?





A lawsuit has challenged Trump's Gold Card visa program, calling it an illegal fast lane for wealthy foreigners, irrespective of merit while researchers and scientists are waiting in the backlogged queue. The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Washington, asked the judge to block the program as it prioritizes wealth over intellect or ability and bypasses Congress in the process.The Gold Card program promises permanent residency in exchange for payments of at least $1 million, like the EB-1 and EB-2 visas. In EB category visas, the applicants have to create jobs in the US but Gold Card visa program gives a waiver to the applicants from that criteria as they are 'gifting' the government a specific amount of money.“Rather than reserving those visas for the world’s best and brightest, the Gold Card program converts those visas into revenue-generating commodities sold to the highest bidder,” the lawsuit by a coalition of immigrants, labor unions and academic organizations argued.People with extraordinary ability qualify for an EB-1 visa showing sustained national or international acclaim and achievements that have been recognized in their field.One must intend to continue to work in this field and show that you will substantially benefit the United States in the future.The lawsuit noted that none of these categories created by Congress includes a million-dollar pay and play option and there is a separate visa category for that. EB-5 was specifically created by Congress to spur investment in the US and this category requires applicants to invest about $1 million in a new commercial enterprise for at least two years, but it also has other, more stringent requirements, including specifications as to where such investments must be made.“If you look at the statute, you can tell Congress made some pretty deliberate decisions about how they wanted to structure the availability of these visas,” said Sarah Wilson, a partner at the law firm Colombo & Hurd and one of the lawyers who brought the suit. Wilson's firm was joined by the Democracy Defenders Fund, a nonprofit that challenged Trump administration on a number of fronts.","A lawsuit has challenged trump's gold card visa program, calling it an illegal fast lane for wealthy foreigners.
