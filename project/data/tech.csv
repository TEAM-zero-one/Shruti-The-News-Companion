NEW DELHI: An Indian startup ’s commercial space surveillance satellite, capable of tracking objects as small as 5cm orbiting the Earth, was commissioned last Saturday as it captured images over South America.“Space just ran out of hiding spots,” Bengaluru start-up Digantara said in a post on X as its satellite SCOT (Space Camera for Object Tracking) started operations.Digantara had launched SCOT on Jan 14 aboard Elon Musk-owned SpaceX’s Transporter-12 rocket.In a statement, the company said the SCOT satellite achieved first light on Saturday and its inaugural image while passing over South America — a breathtaking view of Earth’s limb, with the city of Buenos Aires glowing against the planet’s curvature.","An indian startup ’s commercial space surveillance satellite was commissioned last saturday as it captured images over south america. “space just ran out of hiding spots,” digantara said in a post on x as its satellite scot (space camera for object tracking) started operations.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118909594,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-971290,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Going off-patent

10.1cr Indians live with diabetes, most end up paying out of pocket

NEW DELHI: Several domestic drug companies are set to transform diabetes therapy by launching the blockbuster drug Empagliflozin at a fraction of the innovator’s price.Affordable generics will hit the market within days, following the expiry of Boehringer Ingelheim’s patent on Empagliflozin on March 11, industry sources told TOI.The launch of generic Empagliflozin , used to treat diabetes, related comorbidities, including heart failure, promises to slash therapy costs, making it more accessible to millions of diabetics and easing the financial strain of this debilitating disease. Those looking to launch the drug include Mankind Pharma , Torrent, Alkem, Dr Reddy’s and Lupin.Mankind Pharma, India’s fourth-largest firm by market share, plans to offer Empagliflozin at one-tenth the innovator’s Rs 60 per tablet, sources said.Most generic versions will cost Rs 9-14 per tablet, disrupting the high-growth diabetes therapy market valued at nearly Rs 20,000 crore, up 43% from Rs 14,000 crore in 2021.The market was further bolstered by Torrent Pharmaceuticals’ acquisition of three Empagliflozin brands from Boehringer Ingelheim last year. With India facing a staggering public health burden—10.1 crore people live with diabetes, according to International Diabetes Federation— this shift is critical.“This aligns with our philosophy of breaking cost barriers with a high-quality product (raw materials certified by regulators like the USFDA) at an affordable price. Using our own active pharmaceutical ingredient in bulk lowers costs, and we will deploy separate teams to promote two distinct brands, boosting distribution and market share,” said a Mankind Pharma executive.The market size of Empagliflozin and its combinations is estimated at Rs 640 crore. Experts highlight its ability to significantly reduce heart failure hospitalisations, slow chronic kidney disease progression and improve survival in both diabetic and non-diabetic patients, though high pricing has long limited access.Metformin remains the first-line treatment for type-2 diabetes, but as the disease progresses, additional medications—such as Sulfonylureas (glimepiride, glyburide, glipizide, chlorpropamide), DPP-4 Inhibitors (sitagliptin, vildagliptin), and SGLT2 Inhibitors (empagliflozin, dapagliflozin, canagliflozin)—are added. Now, newer therapies like semaglutide and tirzepatide enhance management, offering improved glycemic control and cardiovascular benefits.The economic burden of diabetes weighs heavily in India, where most patients pay out-of-pocket due to limited medical reimbursement. Treatment costs escalate with complications, magnifying the challenge.","Affordable generics will hit the market within days, following the expiry of boehringer ingelheim’s patent on empagliflozin.

‘Make in India’ boost as private company produces key Tejas component,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/make-in-india-boost-as-private-company-produces-key-tejas-component/articleshow/118824830.cms,"File photo

NEW DELHI: The first rear fuselage for the Tejas Mark-1A jet produced by the private sector was handed over to defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL), which is struggling to produce the indigenous fighter, in the presence of defence minister Rajnath Singh in Bengaluru on Sunday.“This is a testimony to India’s progress towards Aatmanirbharta in defence and the govt’s commitment towards enhanced public-private partnership. HAL and the private sector are playing a key role in strengthening the armed forces with the latest platforms and technologies,” Singh said, in the presence of IAF chief Air Chief Marshal A P Singh. “HAL, through its integrated model and strategies, is not only bolstering India’s defence capabilities but also adding new dimensions to Indian defence manufacturing ,” Singh added.HAL had placed orders with various Indian private companies such as L&T, Alpha Tocol Engineering Services, Tata Advanced Systems Ltd, VEM Technologies and Lakshmi Mission Works for supplying major modules for the Tejas Mark-1A fighters.This comes even as the IAF chief has publicly lashed out at HAL in recent weeks.The IAF till now has got 38 of the first 40 Tejas Mark-1 fighters ordered for Rs 8,802 crore under two contracts inked in 2006 and 2010. The first “improved” Tejas Mark-1A jet, out of the 83 contracted from HAL under the Rs 46,898 crore deal in Feb 2021, is yet to be delivered. The order for another 97 Tejas Mark-1A fighters for Rs 67,000 crore is also in the pipeline. The almost two-year delay in delivery of 99 GE-404 engines by US firm General Electric is one of the main reasons for the delay in the Tejas fighters.The MoD, on its part, said HAL has already manufactured 12 rear fuselages for the Tejas Mark-1A fighters, which are on the aircraft in the manufacturing line. “With this supply, a major structure module produced by an Indian private partner will be integrated into the Mark-1A aircraft, enabling HAL to meet additional delivery commitments for the IAF from 2025-26 onwards,” an official said.",The first rear fuselage for the tejas mark-1a jet produced by the private sector was handed over to defence psu hindustan aeronautics limited (hal) in bengaluru on sunday. This comes even as the iaf chief has publicly lashed out at hal in recent weeks.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118824844,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-722541,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
"'Come to bed': Who is Sarah Wynn Williams, former Meta director, making explosive claims about Zuckerberg, Sandberg?",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/come-to-bed-who-is-sarah-wynn-williams-former-meta-director-making-explosive-claims-about-zuckerberg-sandberg/articleshow/118893213.cms,"Sarah Wynn Williams has made explosive claims about Mark Zuckerberg, Sheryl Sandberg.

Who is Sarah Wynn-Williams?

What did Meta say about the new allegations?

Sarah Wynn Williams has hit the headlines after her book 'Careless People: A Cautionary Tale of Power, Greed, and Lost Idealism' exposed the people in power of Meta, then Facebook. Williams too was a director of the company where she worked for six years before quitting in 2017.Williams accused former Facebook COO Sheryl Sanberg of approaching her female assistant improperly during a trip. Williams wrote that during a trip to Europe, Sandberg spent $13,000 on lingerie for herself and her young female assistant whom she invited to the bed on a private jet flight. Williams said she was also offered to join Sandberg in the only bed that the jet had and Sandberg was rankled when her offer was rejected.Williams said under Zuckerberg and Sandberg, Facebook's culture turned rotten with shocking accounts of misogyny and double standards as the two top executives turned a blind eye to what was happening in the company.Williams alleged that Zuckerberg worked 'hand in glove' with Beijing and considered sharing user data with China.A former New Zealand diplomat, Sarah Wynn-Williams was a Facebook director who accused her boss Joel Kaplan of sexually harassing her. Kaplan was then the vice president of Facebook for global public policy. Williams was fired from her post as director in 2017 following her complaint against her boss, which she believes was retaliation for making the complaint. Meta, however, maintained that Willians was fired for ""poor performance"" and ""toxic behavior"" and the investigation against Kaplan was found ""misleading"".Williams has also filed a whistleblower complaint with the US markets regulator, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), alleging Meta misled investors.Meta said the allegations in Williams' books are a mix of ""out-of-date and previously reported claims"" about the company. The company said since Williams was fired in 2017, she has been paid by anti-Facebook activists to continue complaining against Facebook.On the China allegations, Meta said it was no secret that Facebook was once interested in operating services in China but ultimately opted not to do it.","Sarah wynn williams has made explosive claims about mark zuckerberg, sheryl sandberg.

Southwest Airlines ending 'bags fly free' policy after 54 years,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/southwest-airlines-ending-bags-fly-free-policy-after-54-years/articleshow/118891435.cms,"Southwest Airlines is ending its free checked baggage policy.

'Bags fly free' no more

Dallas-based Southwest Airlines announced Tuesday that it would no longer allow free checked baggage beginning on May 28. Only the members of its A-list loyalty program or business passengers will be exempt from the fees. “We have tremendous opportunity to meet current and future customer needs, attract new customer segments we don’t compete for today, and return to the levels of profitability that both we and our shareholders expect,” said Bob Jordan, CEO of Southwest, in a press release.Since its founding in 1971, Southwest had two perks: open seating and bags fly free. But now both are gone, first, they did away with open seating and then free baggage. CNN called this move a ""seismic shift"" for the Southwest and the 'Bags fly free' policy which was also its tagline set Southwest apart from its competitors.Southwest didn’t immediately reveal how much the checked bags would cost. Regardless of the price, it will likely instantly boost its bottom line because Southwest has two to three times as many checked bags as other airlines, CNN reported adding that the shares of Southwest soared nearly 6 per cent in premarket trading after it announced its policy change.Southwest said these two changes were necessary as the customers have been pitching for allocated seats. When people switch to a competitor from Southwest, the company said the No. 1 reason passengers cite is open seating. But the change will also help the company charge some passengers more for their tickets.In another crucial change, Southwest announced that apart from Southwest.com, it would sell tickets on Expedia in an attempt to attract more customers. Southwest also announced Tuesday it will also start selling “basic economy” fares in May, which are low-priced tickets but with tons of restrictions.","Since its founding in 1971, southwest had two perks: open seating and bags fly free.

Meghan Markle's father blasts her new Netflix cookery show,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/shes-faking-it-for-the-cameras-meghan-markles-father-blasts-her-new-netflix-cookery-show/articleshow/118855446.cms,"This image released by Netflix shows Meghan, Duchess of Sussex, left, and Mindy Kaling in a scene from ""With Love, Meghan.""

With Love,

Meghan

With Love, Meghan

The Duchess of Sussex , in the second episode of her new Netflix cookery show, shares how her passion for jam-making stems from childhood memories of her grandmother making apple butter. However, her estranged father, 80-year-old Thomas Markle Sr , has criticised the series, claiming Meghan has ""never been authentic"" and that ""she's faking it for the cameras.""He said that whilst his mother Doris, who passed away in 2011, deeply cared for Meghan, she would be distressed by her granddaughter's recent statements. ""I haven't seen the show but I've seen a ton of clips and I've read many stories. I might sit down and watch it one day but I'm not sure,"" Meghan’s father, Thomas Markle Sr told The Daily Mail on Sunday.During the show, viewers noticed an interaction between Meghan and Mindy Kaling , where Meghan interrupts her friend for using ' Meghan Markle ', stating: ""It's so funny you keep saying 'Meghan Markle', you know I'm 'Sussex' now.""Thomas responded: ""My mum loved Meghan very much but she would be so disappointed to hear that Meghan no longer wants to use the name ""Markle."" He further remarked sarcastically: ""Now I have to say, I am Meghan Sussex's dad.""Thomas, a seasoned Hollywood professional who has worked on shows like Married… with Children and General Hospital, shared insights from his industry experience, stating that: ""Cooking shows are horrendously boring unless the presenter has a passion for it.""""You have to be authentic to hold people’s attention. When you are stuffing the turkey’s ass it has to look like you’re having fun doing it. Unfortunately Meghan has never been authentic. She has to think about everything. She's not spontaneous. Everything she says is pre-planned and rehearsed. It makes me laugh because I know all her looks and expressions,"" the retired TV lighting director, said.He continued: ""I know when she's faking it for the cameras. She's trying so hard to be perfect that she tenses up every time the camera is on her.""""The best cooks are funny, they mess up, they are human. She just wants to be perfect. It’s sad because she’s trying so hard to stay in the limelight,"" he added.In the Netflix series, Meghan portrayed herself as a ""latchkey kid"" and discussed her supposedly modest upbringing, claiming regular consumption of fast food and TV dinners stating that: ""I grew up with a lot of fast food and also a lot of TV tray dinners. It feels like such a different time but that was so normal with the microwavable kids meals.'Thomas countered this narrative, explaining, ""We occasionally ate TV dinners, which family doesn’t?’ But I was working two jobs so money was never an issue. We would eat out at least three times a week and order in the rest of the time.""Contrary to claims of a fast-food upbringing, Meghan regularly visited Musso & Frank, an upscale Hollywood establishment operating since 1919, which was her preferred dining spot.Thomas elaborated: ""Like any single father who did a long day's work, I'd occasionally put a TV dinner in the microwave. But most of the time we'd go out. After school I would either pick her up myself and we'd go out to eat or I'd send a car to bring her to the set. She grew up on the sets I worked on. She was never a latchkey kid.""He noted that whilst his former spouse excelled at cooking, Meghan showed limited interest in culinary pursuits during her childhood. He considers her current show disconnected from everyday reality.""Meghan should make affordable food and show people how to stretch their food budget,"" he suggested further adding that, ""The women who watch Meghan's show are not all rich and privileged. I think people would love it if she focused on more economical dishes.""These statements follow recent criticism from Thomas Markle Jr, who disputed Meghan's childhood accounts in her Netflix programme.""That's just another one of the malarkey stories she sold to the royal family for sympathy,"" Thomas Jr. told TalkTV, having not communicated with the duchess for over ten years.""We weren't poor. She didn't have to rub two nickels together at Sizzler's salad bar. The entire world knows how she treated her family, especially her father, who gave her everything. That’s why nobody’s buying it,"" he added.Last week, it was revealed that the second season ofhas already been filmed and is set to premiere on Netflix this summer. The series is part of the Sussexes' five-year, $100 million deal with the streaming giant, which is set to expire in October.

The collection also contained an intimate snapshot of Meghan and Harry sharing a joyful embrace on the beach.The caption read: Celebrating the strong women around us & the girls with dreams who will become women with vision. Also thanking those who uplift us every day.'Despite mixed reviews of her new Netflix programme With Love , Meghan appears enthusiastic, announcing its second season renewal through a celebratory Instagram dance. Industry sources suggest the surrounding controversy influenced the decision for renewal.Responding to recent criticism, she acknowledged her learning process, admitting she makes mistakes, but emphasised that she is ""learning every day"" following the widespread backlash to her highly anticipated Netflix show.She said: ""Right now! I’m launching my business, As Ever, which has been my heartsong for years. Every day I’m learning so much as a founder.

Q:

How do you manage to write under the pressure of the standards you set for yourself?

A:

Q:

While I was reading your books, I kept thinking you're writing self-portraits, but in a sense, a self-portrait of you emerges as well, along with your parents. And it's a leisurely pace, as if one was walking through a museum.

A:

Q:

In your books you talk about the cultural and the socioeconomic context, and the lives that these individual artists lived. And you also do it in your analysis of artists who are women.

A:

Q:

What I marvel at is how your writing styles are so distinct in your three books that I've seen. And yet it's you.

A:

Listen here:Excerpts from the interview:I write about art during the week for my newspaper, The Observer, with what I think of as my right hand. I write about art for my books, art and life and the intersection between them, which is my special subject, with my left hand, if you like. My brain is playing split between these two worlds, between the professional commitments for my newspaper and then for book writing, which is where I feel a freedom and a comfort and a different kind of audience and a different kind of time scheme. And one is able to tell stories at length about painters and life and culture, and, in my case, in the new book, about sudden death and accidents and my father, who flew planes in India, in fact, in the Second World War.The way you describe that perfectly goes to my experience of museums and of looking at art, which all of the people listening will know, which is that when you're in a museum, you miss paintings. There are crowds in front of paintings. There are paintings that you feel are very particularly yours because you found them and you're alone looking at them. And I think of museums as being almost like cities where people walk and they see other people. In the case of artworks, I'm thinking of them as having a kind of personality. I feel that museums are like the places that we live. And they're not very different to me, in my mind. And all of the books that I have written do have moments I've described in the current book 'Thunderclap. They are moments where a person, particularly painters, see a work of art and there's a huge moment, and the feeling that you are seeing something really radically connected to you and only to you, and everybody has a different experience of everything. All of my books are arguing the same thing, which is that the human relationship with art is entirely personal.I always feel that I'm a bit mutinous, about art historians, because with regard to Dutch art, and this very much goes to women painting in the mid century, in the 17th century, we're always being told what to see, what to think. This is a symbol. Here is a skull. It must be about death. Here's a piece of cheese, maybe that's about death… Dutch art is very particularly supposedly full of these, you know, warnings against mortality and vanity and so on, but they really aren't. So one argument about Dutch art is that it's all symbolic. And I think, no, they're not. They're about the incredible beauty of the world and the amazing way that light gives its grace to everything that we look at around us and so on. And they're about the wonder of art, and they're not about something very simple. And. And what is always said about Dutch art, and I think completely wrongly, is that it's a sequence of photographs. And it's so democratic, it's so all embracing, and it's so infinite in its reach through everything that you can see. Everything is imagined, remarked upon, remembered, felt and painted by the artists.I can't paint and I can't sculpt. And I'm terrible at taking photographs, but I appreciate them enormously. So the only thing I have is words because I can't draw. And if I could draw, maybe I would be making art. But as it is, I have the thing I have which is just words and practice with words and so on. So I'm putting words to images and things that I want to praise and things that I want the viewer to see. And it arrives out of the fact that I couldn't be an artist because I had no talent.","Laura cummings challenges 'photographic' view of dutch paintings. Cummings: 'i can't paint and i can't sculpt.

Croatia is trying a Roman emperor’s price cap to tame inflation. Will it work?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/croatia-is-trying-a-roman-emperors-price-cap-to-tame-inflation-will-it-work/articleshow/118827556.cms,"File photo

SPLIT (CROATIA): In AD 301, Emperor Diocletian made a bold but ultimately unsuccessful bid to address the inflation that was rampaging across the eastern half of the divided Roman Empire. Prices of everything from purple thread and feathers to cattle were dictated by his Edict on Maximum Prices. Violators faced the death penalty. Diocletian gave up power about four years after issuing his edict, watching his measure fail from his sprawling retirement palace in the heart of what became the city of Split in Croatia.Now Croatia’s govt is trying a similar tactic to rein in prices, which have soared in recent years and have sparked protests and retail boycotts by the country’s beleaguered consumers. The govt introduced price controls for retailers last month, targeting supermarket items such as bread, pork and shampoo. The penalties are less drastic than those decreed by Diocletian, mandating a fine of up to €30,000, for retailers breaking the rules. It is unclear whether the new edict will be any more successful than Diocletian’s, which economists say ended up being counterproductive by causing shortages, fuelling a black market and enabling profiteers. For the moment, consumers are still figuring out how to navigate the new system, which caps the price of 70 common grocery store products.Anita Kargotic, 62, went shopping recently at a Spar supermarket, where two signs were posted outside listing the maximum prices allowed for a range of goods. She tied her American Akita, named Maja, to a post outside, and later emerged from the store with a haul of kaiser rolls, popcorn kernels, soy flakes and crackers. Most were store-brand gene rics, already less expensive than more recognisable labels.Flea collars and dry dog food? Those are necessities. Grapes? No, too expensive. Staples like rice and pasta? Pass. “Those prices have become completely unreasonable,” she said.The new rules are the govt’s third attempt at controlling prices by fiat since Sept 2022. The first two efforts were largely ineffective, with retailers simply refusing to stock most pricecontrolled goods. The govt says it is serious this time, and it has promised regular inspections and fines for violators.Under the new rules brought in by PM Andrej Plenkovic, shop entrances must display a list of all 70 items that fall under the govt’s pricing regulations. Centuries ago, Diocleti an’s edict accused some citizens of price gouging and said their greed needed to be reined in. In Jan, Plenkovic struck a similar tone. “We support companies that work well and make a profit, but within realistic frames. That can’t be at the expense of the little guy,” he said.Many people say price controls are not the answer. John H. Cochrane, an economist, pointed to the role Diocletian’s edict played in causing shortages and fuelling a black market. “It’s like trying to stem the symptoms rather than treating the underlying disease,” Cochrane said of price controls.","Croatia's govt introduced price controls for retailers last month, targeting supermarket items such as bread, pork and shampoo.

In February, the vegetarian thali saw a reduction in cost compared to the previous year, whilst the non-vegetarian thali showed an increase due to higher broiler prices.

The vegetarian thali saw a 1% reduction year-on-year in February, whereas the non-vegetarian thali registered an increase of approximately 6%:

The reduction in vegetarian thali cost was attributed to decreased prices of tomato and LPG cylinder

was attributed to decreased prices of tomato and LPG cylinder Tomato prices reduced to Rs 23/kg from Rs 32/kg, showing a 28% decrease year-on-year, due to 20% increased supply

LPG costs decreased by 11% year-on-year (to Rs 803 per 14.2 kg cylinder in Delhi from Rs 903) providing additional savings

The decline would have been more substantial if not for the increased prices of onion (11%), potato (16%) and vegetable oil (18%) year-on-year, says CRISIL.

In some relief for the common man, the cost of a home-cooked vegetarian thali declined year-on-year in February, according to CRISIL’s latest monthly indicator of food plate cost, RRR (Roti Rice Rate). The cost of a non-vegetarian thali, however grew approximately 6% due to rise in broiler (chicken) prices, the report said. On a month-on-month basis the cost of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian thalis came down.The calculation of an average thali's preparation cost at home by CRISIL considers input prices across different regions of India. Monthly variations indicate the impact on everyday household expenses. The analysis tracks price movements of essential ingredients including cereals, pulses, broilers, vegetables, spices, edible oil and cooking gas.The rise in non-vegetarian thali prices was primarily due to a 15% year-on-year increase in broiler (chicken) prices. Broiler (chicken), which constitutes approximately 50% of a non-vegetarian thali's cost, saw this increase due to previous year's low baseline when prices had fallen because of oversupply.Also Read | Q3 FY25 GDP grows at 6.2%; India sees 'highest growth in 12 years' in FY24 - top 10 data points to know Additionally, higher feed expenses, resulting from a 6% year-on-year increase in maize prices, contributed to the overall cost surge.During the month, both vegetarian and nonvegetarian thali costs decreased by 5% compared to the previous month. This reduction was attributed to fresh supplies causing price drops in onion (7%), potato (17%), and tomato (25%). Additionally, broiler (chicken) prices fell by an estimated 5% month-on-month due to reduced demand following bird flu concerns in southern India.","Cost of a home-cooked vegetarian thali declined year-on-year in february.

NEW DELHI: Airtel gained a significant edge in the domestic telecom market by striking an agreement with Elon Musk’s Starlink to market the broadband and internet satellite services of the American company, while also using the latter’s network to supplement its coverage across the country.Work on the partnership will, however, start only after Starlink – which is awaiting official approval – gets a go-ahead from the security establishment, even as govt works out pricing and other modalities to accord satellite spectrum to satcom companies on an administrative basis.“This is the first agreement to be signed in India, which is subject to SpaceX receiving its own authorisations to sell Starlink in India,” Airtel said in a statement on Tuesday. “It enables Airtel and SpaceX to further explore how Starlink can complement and expand Airtel’s offerings, and how Airtel’s expertise in the Indian market complements SpaceX’s direct offerings to consumers and businesses.”Airtel closed the deal even as the company and its promoter Sunil Mittal has a stake in Eutelsat One Web, which has received a govt licence to operate satcom services in India and is awaiting spectrum.The deal is also surprising as Airtel had recently joined hands with Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio to oppose administrative spectrum to satcom companies such as Starlink, demanding that airwaves should only be auctioned.The move will now see the two companies work out retail and network optimisation efforts.“Airtel and SpaceX will explore to offer Starlink equipment in Airtel’s retail stores, Starlink services via Airtel to business customers, opportunities to connect communities, schools, and health centres, among many others, in even the most rural parts of India,” the companies said, adding that they will also explore “how Starlink could help expand and enhance the Airtel network, as well as SpaceX’s ability to utilise and benefit from Airtel’s ground network infrastructure and other capabilities in the country.”Bharti Airtel MD and VC Gopal Vittal said working with SpaceX to offer Starlink to Airtel customers is a “significant milestone” and demonstrates the company’s commitment to offer next-generation satellite connectivity. “This collaboration enhances our ability to bring world-class high-speed broadband to even the most remote parts of India, ensuring that every individual, business, and community has reliable internet. Starlink will complement and enhance Airtel’s suite of products to ensure reliable and affordable broadband for our Indian customers – wherever they live and work,” he said.SpaceX president and COO Gwynne Shotwell said the company is “excited to work with Airtel and unlock the transformative impact” Starlink can bring in India.Airtel said it remains committed to offer comprehensive and reliable connectivity and digital solutions leveraging advanced technology with a focus on customer-centric services. “By adding Starlink, (in addition to its existing alliance with Eutelsat OneWeb) to its offerings, Airtel will further its ability to offer nationwide connectivity and connect previously underserved areas, particularly those with limited to no coverage today. With Starlink enterprise suite, Airtel will be able to offer enterprises, businesses, and communities comprehensive and seamless connectivity packages.”","Airtel, spacex to work on network, retail synergies.

Concerns over governance gaps



Stay informed with the latest business news, updates on bank holidays and public holidays.





MUMBAI: IndusInd Bank shares plunged 27% on Tuesday to Rs 656, erasing Rs 19,000 crore in market value — the sharpest drop in its history. The fall followed the bank’s disclosure of Rs 2,100 crore derivatives accounting discrepancy , cutting net worth by 2.4%. The stock hit its lowest since Nov 2020, making it Nifty 50’s worst performer in a year.Markets feared that a sharp fall in the price of the bank shares would trigger margin calls for the promoters — Mauritius-based IndusInd International Holdings — who have pledged nearly half their 15% holdings as of end-Dec 2024. Shares of other small private banks — Bandhan Bank and RBL fell by 5% and 2.7% respectively, as investor sentiment turned wary.The bank’s MD and CEO Sumant Kathpalia in an analyst call on Monday evening said that the post-tax impact of the derivative losses would be around Rs 1,530 crore (2.35% of bank’s net worth). According to Kathpalia, the bank’s capital adequacy and profits were enough to absorb the hit. However, markets were concerned over governance gaps, risk management flaws, and regulatory scrutiny.According to a research report by Macquarie, IIHL holds nearly 15.1% stake in IndusInd Bank, with around 7.7% of total outstanding shares and just under 50.9% of their stake pledged. The loan, initially Rs 3,088 crore in 2021, was topped up on Dec 20, 2024, raising the pledged stake’s value from Rs 4,967crore to Rs 5,554 crore. According to Macquarie, at a share price of Rs 600, the promoters would have to pledge 80% of their holdings to provide margin for their loans.“In our view, clearly there is a significant trust deficit and speaking to investors, they are waiting for change in management to restore credibility and trust here which is going to be a long process. So unfortunately now earnings recovery won’t matter as investors don’t trust the balance sheet, internal processes and compliance,” said Suresh Ganapathy of Macquarie in his report.IndusInd Bank, meanwhile, has hired PwC India for an independent review, which is expected by April 2025.","Indusind bank shares plunged 27% on tuesday to rs 656, erasing rs 19,000 crore in market value.

NEW DELHI: With India’s workforce undergoing rapid transformation, organisations are re-imagining employee benefits to meet diverse needs and secure top talent. Companies are increasingly adopting innovative solutions, including flexible health insurance plans , mental health support , and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives to create a more supportive workplace.Over past five years, there has been a 300% surge in companies offering flexible health insurance plans, with focus on parents, siblings cover and wellness programmes and financial planning tools, ‘The Future of Benefits 2024’ report by Mercer Marsh Benefits said.Employees are demanding greater autonomy in choosing benefits, leading to increased adoption of customisable insurance and wellness programs. The BFSI sector provides the highest sum insured, followed by pharma and IT/ITES/ecom. Further, the IT/ITES/ ecom sector stands out by offering ESCP (employee, spouse, children, parents/in laws) at 73% as a default inclusion, followed by pharma at 64% and manufacturing at 54%, it adds.The report reflects analysis across 14 industries, over 10,000 policies and over 600 benefit evaluations. Employer sponsorship for parental insurance rose from 35% in 2019 to 53% in 2024, making it a key benefit for employee retention and well-being.
