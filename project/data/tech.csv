It cited the company’s technology-focused strategy, AI-driven customer engagement, and a store payback period of under one year, adding that profitability is expected to strengthen as the business expands into additional regions.Nirmal Bang, according to ET, acknowledged that the IPO appears expensive at first, but the valuation holds up when compared with modern retail peers such as Trent and Metro. The brokerage maintained a Subscribe (long-term) stance, referring to Lenskart’s brand strength, premium product mix, and international expansion plans.The company’s market debut follows a strong response in the anchor book.

Horses take centre stage at Pushkar fair this year with sales totalling Rs 75 lakh,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/horses-take-centre-stage-at-pushkar-fair-this-year-with-sales-totalling-rs-75-lakh/articleshow/125027579.cms,"JAIPUR: The renowned Pushkar annual cattle fair in Rajasthan, traditionally a hub for camel and bovine sales, saw a significant shift in trends this year with a remarkable increase in the sale of Marwadi and Kathiawadi horses.This overshadowed the traditional livestock sales, marking a notable change in buyer preferences.According to the state animal husbandry department, as of Friday, 224 horses have been sold for an estimated Rs 75 lakh.The department also addressed and dismissed social media claims of exorbitantly priced horse sales, clarifying that the highest price recorded so far is Rs 4.6 lakh for a horse sold by a Jaipur-based owner to a buyer from Uttarakhand.Traditionally, the fair has been a marketplace for cows and buffaloes but buyers are now shifting their focus towards horses.""For the last few years, this has been a trend as people are inclined towards purchasing horses, which in rural areas are still a mode of transportation,"" a senior officer from the animal husbandry department said.Following horses, camels have also seen significant sales, with 207 camels sold for a total of Rs 35 lakh by Oct 30.In contrast, only five buffaloes and one cow have been sold at the fair.""People are interested in horses and camels as a means of transportation. In many districts, camel carts and horse carts are still used for transporting food grain to mandi (wholesale markets),"" Sunil Ghiya, joint director of animal husbandry, told TOI.Ghiya also refuted social media claims of a horse being sold for over a crore rupees, confirming the most expensive horse was sold for Rs 4.6 lakh by Kailash, a resident of Amber near Jaipur, to one Dilip Choudhary of Haridwar in Uttarakhand.The lowest price for a camel was Rs 8,000, sold by Hasan Khan of Jaisalmer's Sam area to one Banwari of Tonk. The shift in livestock sales is attributed to the advent of modern farming equipment, which has reduced the necessity for bulls in agriculture.""Bulls are no longer used for agricultural purposes with the availability of advanced tractors and other equipment. Also, it is unsafe to purchase cows or buffaloes from such fairs due to the risk of attacks on vehicles transporting them. We prefer buying them from local markets,"" said Choturam Devasi, a cattle farmer from the Raniwara area in Jalore.","The pushkar annual cattle fair in rajasthan saw a significant shift in trends this year with a remarkable increase in the sale of marwadi and kathiawadi horses.

'Some Indian companies': China OKs supply of rare earth magnets to India; what MEA said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/some-indian-companies-china-oks-supply-of-rare-earth-magnets-to-india-what-mea-said/articleshow/124974822.cms,"India’s Iran Gambit Pays Off: US Grants India Sanctions Waiver on Chabahar Port For Six More Months

Rare earth nod comes with no-export rider





NEW DELHI: Govt on Thursday announced ""some Indian companies"" have got approval from China to import rare earth magnets, to be used in automotive and electronics industries.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said licenses have been issued, which will enable access to the magnets whose procurement had been stopped after China put curbs on their sale earlier this year.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal on Thursday confirmed that some Indian companies have received licences for importing rare earth magnets from China, while responding to questions on the matter.""As far as the question of the latest talks and relaxations that have happened between the US and China (and) as to how it is going to play into our domain, I will come back to you. We have yet to look at it. I am not aware of the technicalities... But I do confirm that Indian companies have received licenses for importing rare earths from China,"" he said.Jaiswal, however, did not give details of the companies that have received permission. Industry sources said the companies include those that supply components to the automotive and electronics industries.However, the imports come with certain restrictions. These include conditions that the magnets cannot be exported to the US, and cannot be used for defence-related industries.The curbs have impacted the production of automobiles, especially electric cars and two-wheelers with companies petitioning govt to take up the matter with China.Rare earth magnets are the strongest type of permanent magnets commercially available. Their high magnetic strength and resistance to demagnetisation make them indispensable in a range of applications, especially where weight and space are constraints.According to experts, these magnets are made primarily from rare earth elements like neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium - materials that allow for powerful magnetic properties essential in miniaturised and energy-efficient devices. They are typically made from alloys that contain rare earth elements. The most commonly used rare earth magnet is the neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnet.China is estimated to account for about 70% of global rare earth metals mining and holds nearly 90% of the world's rare earth magnet's production. One of the biggest reasons that China dominates the rare earth magnet industry is its control over the entire supply chain, including mining of rare earth ores, separation and refining of rare earth elements (a complex and environmentally sensitive process), and alloy production and magnet manufacturing.Just in the Indian auto industry alone, about 870 tonnes of rare-earth magnets are required to be imported in FY 2025-26 out of the country's estimated overall requirement of 3,600 tonnes.","Mea spokesperson randhir jaiswal said licenses have been issued, which will enable access to the magnets.

Social media turns explosive as Swifties label Kayla Nicole’s post a jealousy-driven move

The engagement, the album shockwave, and the ongoing stakes

The Taylor Swift–Travis Kelce era continues to command every corner of pop-culture conversation, but this Halloween, the spotlight unexpectedly shifted back to someone outside their circle — Kayla Nicole. While Swift’s fanbase has been riding a high since the tight end announced his engagement to the music superstar in August, Nicole’s Halloween Instagram activity has reopened old wounds and reignited an internet tug-of-war.Swifties saw her Toni Braxton costume and the music choice attached to it, not as nostalgia or simple creativity, but as a targeted jab at the newly engaged couple. And in an entertainment environment where narrative, timing, and symbolism matter just as much as actual words, that single video triggered a wildfire reaction online, one that shows how rapidly fandom culture punishes perceived provocation.Kayla Nicole posting herself dancing to “He wasn’t man enough” may have felt harmless or playful in her own lens, but Taylor Swift ’s fanbase did not view it through that filter. They instantly connected dots to Travis Kelce, dissected the timing, and responded aggressively. Many comments were brutal, including “Remember when in this video Travis specifically told her “none of you are getting married” and she still pathetically posted this? She’s a sad, pathetic, nobody loser.”Fans argued this wasn’t just a costume; it was narrative warfare. One user doubled down, writing “Kayla Nicole is embarrassing lol. Her being THIS obsessed with Taylor and Travis three years after the breakup is not the flex you all think it is. However, being the woman who gets the ring two years in is.”For fans, Kelce has long moved on and so should she.Swift dropping “The Life of a Showgirl” only amplified tension. “Opalite”, though never directly naming Nicole, was broadly interpreted by fans as a lyrical slap. Nicole herself admitted she feared reaction to it. That vulnerability now contrasts strangely with this latest costume-driven provocation.Meanwhile, Kelce is simply focused on Buffalo. With 474 yards and three touchdowns, the tight end continues to be a centerpiece in Kansas City’s offense and the Swift-Kelce machine looks fully locked on the future, not the past.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s choreographer exposes her past struggles — from stage anxiety to finding confidence with Travis Kelce by her side","Kayla nicole's halloween costume sparked outrage among swifties, who interpreted it as a jab at taylor swift and travis kelce.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says that the company’s latest round of layoffs that impacted barely 14,000 people is not because of money or AI. Instead, the real reason behind Amazon job cuts is the culture, Jassy said. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” he said as quoted by Business Insider. “It really — it's culture.”“And if you grow as fast as we did for several years, the size of businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers,” Jassy explained.“And when that happens, Sometimes, without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work,” he added. “And it can lead to slowing you down.”In a blog post dated October 28, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti announced that the e-commerce company is “making organizational changes across Amazon that will impact some of our teammates.”“While this will include reducing in some areas and hiring in others, it will mean an overall reduction in our corporate workforce of approximately 14,000 roles,” she said.Amazon’s latest job cuts is the company’s biggest layoff since 2022 when the company laid off 27,000 positions. Jassy’s remarks contradict what Amazon executive has been saying about the job cuts.In the blog post, Beth Galetti explained “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.”Separately, Tapas Roy, vice president of device software and services sent a company-wide email this week saying the company is cutting roles within its OS & Services team and asked remaining workers to ""lean in on AI.""","Amazon ceo andy jassy says that the company’s latest round of layoffs that impacted barely 14,000 people is not because of money or ai. “the announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really ai-driven, not right now at least,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124986273,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-17580,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

What the companies are saying







YouTube TV subscribers woke up to a blackout of Disney-owned channels including ESPN, ABC, FX and National Geographic after the contract negotiations between Google and Disney failed to reach a new agreement before the deadline of October 30. The blackout of Disney channels on YouTube TV started around midnight ET on October 31, when the previous deal expired. Earlier this week, Disney also warned its subscribers about the potential disruption citing stalled negotiations over pricing. YouTube TV, which charges $82.99/month, said it was unwilling to accept Disney’s proposed rate hikes, calling them unfair to customers.The timing for the blackout of Disney channels couldn’t be worst as it affects the access to college football, NFL, NBA, and NHL games broadcast on ESPN and ABC. Viewers in Florida, for example, will miss the highly anticipated Florida–Georgia rivalry game this Saturday. Disney’s sports networks including ACC Network and SEC Network are also unavailable, leaving fans without coverage of major playoff events and seasonal matchups.The blackout impacts more than 20 channels, including:In addition to live broadcasts, recorded content from Disney networks has also been removed from YouTube TV’s cloud DVR service.Speaking about the issue, YouTube TV issued an official statement saying, “This decision directly harms our subscribers while benefiting their own live TV products, including Hulu + Live TV and Fubo”. On the other hand, Disney still maintains its stance that its pricing reflects the value of its content and the company has also asked the users to explore alternative platforms.Meanwhile, YouTube TV has also promised a credit of $20 to subscribers if the blackout goes on for an extended period of time.","Youtube tv subscribers woke up to a blackout of disney-owned channels including espn, abc, fx and national geographic.

Apple iPhone sales





Apple reported a surprise fall in sales in China. However, much to investors and the company's relief, the fall has not been due to the decline in demand. Apple reportedly blamed the surprise decline in China revenue on supply disruptions. According to a report in Bloomberg, Apple has predicted that the company will return to growth in the world’s biggest smartphone arena as the iPhone 17 gains momentum. Apple CEO Tim Cook said at the earnings call, “It was basically supply constraints that drove the results.” Cook added, “We’re thrilled with what we’re seeing right now.”Apple CEO said that Apple’s store traffic is up significantly in China, and that the latest iPhones -- iPhone 17 series -- has been well received. Cook also said that Apple reached a new high for September-quarter revenue from services in China, while reiterating that the iPhone is doing very well.According to the report, China was a prominent topic during the earning conference, with analysts asking about the region multiple times. The threat of higher tariffs has disrupted global tech supply chain that’s already in flux because of longer-term decisions to diversify away from China.Apple’s total growth projection for the December quarter is between 10% and 12%.

Reports suggest that Huawei Technologies took the top spot in June, as its campaign to reclaim a bigger share of the premium tier resonated with Chinese consumers.

Apple expects its iPhone sales to increase at least 10% from last year's holiday season, according to projections provided by Apple's chief financial officer, Kevan Parekh.

In a major push to consolidate its presence in the Indian market, OpenAI has announced that it will offer ChatGPT Go free to all users in India starting November 4. For the uninitiated, ChatGPT Go is OpenAI's mid-tier subscription plan for its AI chatbot ChatGPT. The move targets India, which the company identifies as its second-largest and fastest-growing global market.

Both companies recently waived fees for their premium AI features to appeal to the vast Indian consumer base.OpenAI's decision follows Google's move to make its AI Pro membership, priced at Rs 19,500$, free for students for a year. Similarly, Perplexity partnered with telecom giant Airtel to offer free access to its premium plan, intensifying the battle for AI market share in the country.ChatGPT Go, which initially launched in India in August at an affordable monthly price of Rs 399, was designed as a bridge between the free tier and the more expensive ChatGPT Plus subscription. The free ChatGPT Go tier will provide Indian users with significant benefits, including: Higher message limits; Increased daily image generation and uploads; Longer memory for more personalized and context-aware responses"".Since launching ChatGPT Go in India a few months ago, the adoption and creativity we've seen from users has been inspiring,"" said Nick Turley, Vice President and Head of ChatGPT, in a statement.

PewDiePie’s honest opinion about AI use











PewDiePieYouTube star Felix “PewDiePie” Kjellberg has surprised fans again, this time with a big tech project at home. Living in Japan with his wife and son, Felix now spends more time on hobbies he loves. On October 31, 2025, he posted a video called “STOP. Using AI Right now.” In it, he showed his powerful new computer setup, worth around $20,000, built with several RTX 4090 GPUs.He said he first wanted to use this machine to help with cancer research using a project called Folding@home, where people share their computer power with scientists. But soon, he began using the same system to explore AI. This made fans wonder if PewDiePie had built his own artificial intelligence.Felix explained that he didn’t create a new AI from scratch. Instead, he used his computer to self-host existing open-source AI models. He ran OpenAI’s open-source GPT-OSS 120B model, which means it has 120 billion parameters.Later, he tried another model called Qwen 2.5 3B, which needed even stronger hardware. PewDiePie said it felt “exactly like ChatGPT, but much faster.”His goal was not to invent something new but to learn how AI systems work locally and to keep his data private.He said he doesn’t want to depend on big companies like OpenAI or Google.As per Wccftech (Nov 2025), his PC can also help scientists when idle, a mix of tech passion and good cause.Even though Felix likes learning about AI, he doesn’t like how it’s taking over everything online. In the same video, he said he dislikes AI art and AI video tools because he wants to protect real artists.“I don’t mess with image generation or video generation. I stand with the drawing nerds,” he said around 6:40 minutes.Also Read: Sneako Calls Out Erika Kirk For Her Viral Hug With JD Vance And Her Bold Charlie Kirk Comparison He also said seeing AI everywhere “feels annoying” and called some YouTube AI tools “useless.” Still, he added that people who hate AI are “equally bad,” giving the example of Markiplier, who got backlash for using AI in his clothing brand Cloak.Fans online praised his honesty and said PewDiePie “already won at life.”","Youtube star felix “pewdiepie” kjellberg has surprised fans again, this time with a big tech project at home.

What does the new e-passport rollout actually mean?

New e-passport = chip inside: The upgraded passport contains an electronic chip with digitised passport data to speed up immigration clearance and improve security. Applicants will be able to upload a digital, ICAO-compliant photo, signature and supporting documents through the new portal.

No extra biometrics or fees: The Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate in Dubai stated explicitly that biometric collection rules and passport fees remain unchanged for applicants in the UAE. If you’ve given biometrics for a recent passport, you will not be asked again just because of the e-passport introduction.

Who issues them: The Embassy and Consulate will process applications through the Passport Seva Portal (GPSP 2.0) with support from BLS International for on-the-ground services. Missions say they can handle large volumes around 1,600 passports a day across the UAE to speed renewals and new issues.

What exactly is an Indian e-Passport?

Digital chip with encrypted security data

Improved fraud protection and identity verification

Faster processing at international airports

Globally compliant with ICAO standard

No change in services for Indians in UAE

Conclusion





Indian expats in the UAE can finally put the rumours to rest. During a press conference held on October 30, 2025 by the Embassy of India in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate General of India in Dubai, officials clarified that the rollout of India’s new chip-enabled e-passport will not involve any extra biometrics, new procedures, or fee changes for applicants in the UAE. The announcement came amid widespread speculation about additional requirements for the upgraded passport system.The e-passport looks like a regular passport but comes with a secure embedded chip containing the holder’s personal and biometric data. This upgrade enhances security and helps speed up global immigration checks, making travel simpler and safer.Key features of the e-passport include:The initiative is an important part of India’s ongoing mission to modernise travel documents, strengthen cyber-security measures, and align with global digital passport standards.For Indian residents in the UAE, the e-passport rollout will feel no different from the current process. Applicants will continue to use the same channels — including BLS centres, VFS services (where applicable), and the embassy or consulate counters, without the need for new appointments, extra document checks, or revised fees. The missions also urged the community to rely only on official updates from the Embassy or Consulate, reminding expats not to fall for misinformation circulating on social media.The clarification from the Indian Embassy in Abu Dhabi and the Consulate in Dubai has offered much-needed reassurance to the UAE’s Indian community. With no added fees, no extra biometrics, and no change in the application process, the transition to e-passports is set to be smooth and stress-free for expats. As India modernises its passport system to enhance global travel security, UAE-based applicants can continue using the same familiar services without any disruption. For now, the message is simple: nothing changes for you — just a smarter, more secure passport ahead.","Uae indians face no extra steps for new e-passport.

November 2025 fuel prices

What’s Driving the November price Buzz?

Oil prices dropped to around $65 a barrel, raising hopes for a price cut.

Then global supply tensions and sanctions sent prices jumping again up by nearly 5% in one day.

What will become cheaper if prices drop in November?

Daily Commutes Get Cheaper: If you drive to work five days a week, your monthly fuel spend could drop by AED 15–40, depending on distance and car type. It may not feel like a jackpot but over a year, that’s a few brunches saved.

School Runs for Parents: Parents doing multiple school pick-ups and drop-offs will feel this the most. With fewer refills, you save not just dirhams… but also those “Why are we stopping for petrol again?” kid complaints.

Delivery & Ride-Hailing Services: Talabat, Deliveroo, Careem, Uber, RTA taxis, chauffeur services, all rely heavily on petrol costs. If fuel drops, operating costs drop and sometimes customers enjoy lower delivery fees or promo rides.

Business Transport & Logistics: Couriers, small business vans, carpenters, maintenance and AC technicians, all feel the heat when fuel rises. Cheaper petrol can mean:

Lower service charges Fewer fuel surcharges Better deals for customers

Weekends and Road Trips Become More Tempting: Lower fuel prices = guilt-free drives to Abu Dhabi, Fujairah, Ras Al Khaimah or Hatta. A small drop in fuel cost could shave off AED 5–15 per road trip enough to justify that karak stop.

Viral on Instagram: US lawyer sells hot dogs in office suit amid government shutdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/viral-on-instagram-us-lawyer-sells-hot-dogs-in-office-suit-amid-government-shutdown/articleshow/125023579.cms,"From tax code to hot dogs: how an IRS lawyer is surviving the shutdown

'Not At Gun Point': JD Vance Blasts Democrats Amid Shutdown Impasse; 'Cruel Presidency' | Watch

Here’s how the story unfolded:

Stein began selling hot dogs outside his apartment complex, near a construction zone frequented by workers.

Photos of him wearing a grey business suit while serving customers spread quickly across Instagram, where the hashtag #HotDogLawyer began trending.

Many users described him as a symbol of dignity and adaptability in the face of political and economic uncertainty.

Within days, Stein’s stand had long queues, with customers stopping by for both food and selfies.

Stein reportedly said he was “just making the best of a bad situation” and that “serving food beats sitting at home waiting for Congress.”

Social media reacts: ‘Mr IRS agent running a cash business’





When government paychecks stopped, one US tax lawyer picked up a pair of tongs. As the federal government shutdown stretches close to a month, an Internal Revenue Service (IRS) attorney, Isaac Stein, has become an unlikely social media sensation after being spotted selling hot dogs in his office suit from a street cart. His story, now viral on Instagram and TikTok, highlights the growing frustration and financial strain among federal workers caught in the political deadlock.The US government shutdown, now nearing its fourth week, has left thousands of federal employees either furloughed or working without pay. The stalemate stems from a budget dispute between Congress and the White House over spending priorities and funding allocations.For many government workers, this marks one of the longest and most disruptive shutdowns in recent years. Agencies such as the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and parts of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have been partially paralyzed, with many employees turning to side jobs or savings to make ends meet.Isaac Stein, a 36-year-old lawyer from Washington, D.C., who works for the IRS, decided to use his downtime creatively.Unable to report to work or collect his salary, Stein opened a hot dog cart near a construction site, still dressed in his professional suit and tie. Within hours, his photos and videos titled “Hot Dogs and the Tax Man” began circulating on social media, drawing millions of views and comments applauding his resourcefulness.According to local reports from The Washington Post and CNN, Stein had been running the food cart part-time for nearly two years as a hobby before it became his full-time fallback. But with the shutdown suspending his federal duties indefinitely, he decided to take the business public.On Instagram, comments poured in, blending humour, irony, and admiration. Many joked that the IRS lawyer had gone from auditing cash businesses to running one himself, with one viral remark reading, “Mr IRS agent running a cash business.” Others praised his creativity, saying wearing a suit instead of casual clothes was “genius marketing,” while some quipped that he was cleverly “using his business attire as a business expense. ”A few users wondered aloud, “Is he reporting tips?” and “Let’s make sure he reports his cash tips,” poking fun at his day job. Not everyone was sympathetic — some said they wouldn’t “start bawling their eyes out for an IRS employee,” while others found the sight oddly fitting, noting he looked exactly like what they imagined an IRS attorney would. Some even thought the post looked like satire, asking if it was “ripped from The Onion,” while others remarked that he probably “should have money saved up. ”","Isaac stein, a 36-year-old lawyer from washington, d.c. who works for the irs, decided to use his downtime creatively.
