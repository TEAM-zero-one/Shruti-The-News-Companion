Planning to visit a bank in February? It’s smart to check the holiday schedule first, as an unexpected closure can turn a quick errand into a wasted trip. In India, banks observe both national and state-specific holidays, so closure dates may differ from one region to another. In India, bank holidays include both national and state-specific observances, so closure dates can vary across different regions.Banks will remain closed in Sikkim on account of the Losar festival.Banks will be closed in Maharashtra for Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Jayanti.Banks will not operate in Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh in observance of State Day/Statehood Day.Apart from these, banks will also remain closed on second and fourth Saturdays of the month, according to RBI.Being aware of bank holidays in advance can help customers plan essential financial transactions and avoid last-minute hassles. While branches may remain closed on these days, it does not prevent customers from carrying out routine transactions. Digital banking services, including online banking, ATMs, mobile apps, and UPI, remain fully operational for fund transfers, bill payments, and other regular activities.However, services that require a physical visit such as large cash deposits, cheque clearances, or issuing demand drafts will not be available. To prevent inconvenience, account holders are encouraged to plan these tasks ahead and make full use of digital banking options during closures.","Banks will be closed in maharashtra for chhatrapati shivaji maharaj jayanti.

Khaby Lame and Rich Sparkle Holdings deal centers on ownership, AI plans, and long-term growth







Khaby Lame is best known for staying silent online. But this time, his business move is making a lot of noise. On January 11, 2026, Hong Kong–based Rich Sparkle Holdings announced a major business deal connected to Khaby Lame’s brand. The deal is being valued at about $975 million, which quickly led to big headlines and even bigger rumors. Some people claimed Khaby had become a billionaire overnight. Others said he had retired at just 25. Social media ran fast with the story, but not all of it was true.What actually happened is more layered and much more interesting. The deal is not cash, and Khaby did not walk away with nearly a billion dollars in hand. Instead, this agreement is about ownership, long-term plans, and a new way to turn internet fame into a global business.His estimated net worth is around $20–25 million, based on brand deals, content earnings, and business ownership, not the nearly $1 billion stock deal value.Rich Sparkle Holdings announced that it had acquired Step Distinctive Limited, a company linked to Khaby Lame’s business operations. According to the company’s official statement, the transaction was an all-stock deal valued at around $975 million.Because this was an all-stock agreement, Khaby did not receive cash. Instead, he became a major shareholder in Rich Sparkle Holdings. His wealth from this deal depends on how the company performs over time, not on money paid upfront.A key part of the partnership is the plan to create an AI-powered digital twin of Khaby Lame. This digital version would be allowed to use his face, voice, and on-screen style to make content in many languages and stream across different regions.The company says this approach helps move away from short brand deals and instead builds a system that can run at all hours, across many markets. Rich Sparkle Holdings named the United States, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia as early focus regions, with different pricing models for each area.In its public release, Rich Sparkle Holdings said it believes the model could generate over $4 billion in annual revenue, though those numbers depend on execution and audience response.After the announcement, Rich Sparkle Holdings’ stock jumped sharply. Shares rose from around $20 to over $80 in a short time, based on market trading data from the same day.Despite online rumors, there has been no official statement from Khaby Lame confirming retirement. There is also no confirmation that he is now a billionaire in liquid wealth.For now, the deal signals one thing clearly: Khaby is shifting from creator to long-term business owner, with his future tied to how well this company delivers on its plans.","Khaby lame and rich sparkle holdings deal centers on ownership, ai plans, and long-term growth.

Apple is reportedly preparing yo enter the foldable smartphone market. However, the company is still several months away from unveiling its first foldable iPhone, a device positioned at the very top of the lineup to create a halo effect across the portfolio. Apple’s first foldable iPhone is said to feature a book-style design, opening horizontally just like the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold series. However, now a new online report suggests that the Cupertino-based tech giant is considering a smaller clamshell design for its first foldable iPhone.According to a report by Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman, Apple is exploring the idea of introducing a smaller and compact clamshell-style foldable iPhone. Informally referred to as the ‘iPhone Flip’, the smartphone would fold vertically and turn into a compact square form factor similar to the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip and the Motorola Razr. Gurman adds that the prototypes of such designs have been tested inside Apple labs but it is not clear as to when the product will reach the customers.“Now there’s another foldable device under consideration inside Apple labs (and it won’t come as a shock given what Motorola and Samsung Electronics Co.have already done): a square, clamshell-style foldable phone. Apple is betting that its first foldable iPhone will be successful enough to generate real demand for the category and that customers will want additional shapes and sizes, much as they have with traditional slab-style iPhones,” adds the report.Apple has also been working on a giant foldable iPad, but that project has reportedly hit development snags. The company’s focus now appears to be on foldable iPhones, with multiple form factors under consideration to appeal to different segments of the market.","Apple is reportedly preparing to enter the foldable smartphone market.

Anime-themed games on Roblox are everywhere right now. Some fade fast. Others stick around because they keep players coming back. Anime Paradox seems to fall into the second category. At first glance, it looks like another tower defence title with familiar anime faces and flashy attacks. But spend a little time with it, and the grind becomes obvious. Progress slows quickly, upgrades demand patience, and free rewards feel essential rather than optional for anyone hoping to stay competitive. Anime Paradox February codes let you redeem gems, stat chips, trait rerolls, and more.For players trying to build a decent team without sinking hours into farming, they matter.Below is the list of all working Anime Paradox codes in February 2026.Anime Paradox is a Roblox tower defence game where players summon and command powerful anime-style units to fend off waves of enemies and bosses as they defend a base. It blends classic tower defence mechanics with strategic placement and AI-controlled unit combat, so battles play out automatically once your units are deployed.Anime Paradox is built around summoning and upgrading units.That’s the loop. And like most Roblox games built this way, Gems sit at the centre of everything. It sounds simple, but the cost adds up quickly. Progress slows if you rely only on gameplay rewards.

'US Benefited Immensely From Indians', Says Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Warns US Against Scrapping H-1B

What Andrej Karpathy said in his post on X

I'm being accused of overhyping the [site everyone heard too much about today already]. People's reactions varied very widely, from ""how is this interesting at all"" all the way to ""it's so over"".

To add a few words beyond just memes in jest - obviously when you take a look at the activity, it's a lot of garbage - spams, scams, slop, the crypto people, highly concerning privacy/security prompt injection attacks wild west, and a lot of it is explicitly prompted and fake posts/comments designed to convert attention into ad revenue sharing.

And this is clearly not the first the LLMs were put in a loop to talk to each other.

So yes it's a dumpster fire and I also definitely do not recommend that people run this stuff on their computers (I ran mine in an isolated computing environment and even then I was scared), it's way too much of a wild west and you are putting your computer and private data at a high risk.

That said - we have never seen this many

LLM agents

(150,000 atm!) wired up via a global, persistent, agent-first scratchpad. Each of these agents is fairly individually quite capable now, they have their own unique context, data, knowledge, tools, instructions, and the network of all that at this scale is simply unprecedented.

This brings me again to a tweet from a few days ago

""The majority of the ruff ruff is people who look at the current point and people who look at the current slope."", which imo again gets to the heart of the variance. Yes clearly it's a dumpster fire right now. But it's also true that we are well into uncharted territory with bleeding edge automations that we barely even understand individually, let alone a network there of reaching in numbers possibly into ~millions. With increasing capability and increasing proliferation, the second order effects of agent networks that share scratchpads are very difficult to anticipate. I don't really know that we are getting a coordinated ""skynet"" (thought it clearly type checks as early stages of a lot of AI takeoff scifi, the toddler version), but certainly what we are getting is a complete mess of a computer security nightmare at scale. We may also see all kinds of weird activity, e.g. viruses of text that spread across agents, a lot more gain of function on jailbreaks, weird attractor states, highly correlated botnet-like activity, delusions/ psychosis both agent and human, etc. It's very hard to tell, the experiment is running live.

TLDR sure maybe I am ""overhyping"" what you see today, but I am not overhyping large networks of autonomous LLM agents in principle, that I'm pretty sure.","Openai's founding team member andrej karpathy said in his post on x that he was being accused of overhyping the site.

Read articles, watch tutorials, or take short online courses to keep your interest in new technologies.

Check your facts and don't rely too much on automated results to learn how to use AI responsibly.

Keep your digital skills up to date so you can stay confident in a work environment that is always changing.

AI can help you save time on things you do every day, like planning trips, keeping track of your money, or learning new things.

Technology is growing faster than ever in today's world, which is changing quickly. AI, or artificial intelligence, is a part of our lives every day, even if we don't always notice it. AI works behind the scenes in a lot of things, like search engines, mobile phones, office software, and online shopping. Some people are excited about this change, while others are worried about losing their jobs or becoming less important. A strong quote from Sam Altman gives clarity and hope in this situation. He says, ""AI won't take over for people."" But people who use AI will take the place of those who don't. This simple line reminds us that machines don't own the future. People who are willing to learn, change, and grow with technology, instead of running away from it, own it.At first, it might seem like Sam Altman's quote is too direct or harsh. But if we look closely, it has a good message. He is not saying that people will be useless. He is saying that people who know how to use AI the right way will have an edge.AI is a tool, just like computers, phones, and the internet were in the past. A lot of people were scared of these new technologies when they first came out.People who learned how to use them got better over time. This is also happening with AI today.This quote tells people to think of AI as a friend, not a foe. It tells us that being able to learn new things and adapt is more important than ever.Things like jobs, schools, and businesses are changing very quickly right now. AI is now used by a lot of businesses to write, design, help customers, analyze data, and plan. Students use AI to do research and learn. Even small business owners use digital tools to keep track of sales and customers.Because of this, people who don't want to learn new tools may slowly fall behind. It's not that they're less talented; it's that they're not keeping up with change.Sam Altman's words remind us that we can't stop progress. We shouldn't be afraid of it; we should get ready for it.AI isn't just for scientists or big businesses anymore. Now it's a part of everyday life. People use AI when they:These tools cut down on work and save time. They help people concentrate on being creative, solving problems, and growing as people. People who learn how to use these tools wisely often find that work is easier and more productive.AI is powerful, but it cannot replicate everything that makes people unique. Creativity, emotional intelligence, moral judgement, and imagination are still uniquely human traits.A machine can give you information, but it cannot feel sorry for you. It can analyse data, but it cannot truly grasp how people feel. That is why individuals with both technical capabilities and values will always be valued.This viewpoint is supported by a quote from Sam Altman. It claims that success stems from the combination of intelligence and compassion.This quote reminds students to learn new things as well as do their regular schoolwork. Learning about technology early on can help you in many ways later on.For people who work, this is a sign to keep learning new things. Learning never stops, especially in this digital age. Even small things, like learning one new tool at a time, can have a big impact.For business owners, this means using AI to make services better, cut costs, and better serve customers.","Sam altman's quote tells people to think of ai as a tool, just like computers, phones, and the internet were in the past.

Gates Foundation to cut up to 500 jobs by 2030

The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI) – the philanthropy organisation founded by Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Prisicila Chan has cut roughly 8% of its workforce, reports Fortune. The job cut, impacting around 70 employees, comes as the company plans to expand its biomedical and science focus through Biohub. The move “underscores how big donors are racing to back science-heavy, tech-centric projects such as peers like the Gates Foundation,” the report said. For those unaware, Gates Foundation was founded by Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates and his ex-wife Melinda French Gates. The foundation, which plans to shut down in 2045, has announced to donate a whopping $9 billion in 2026 alone “primarily focused on health care and disease research.”CZI aims to concentrate its resources on Biohub, a growing network of biomedical research institutes that aims to “cure or prevent all disease. As explained in the Fortune report, the job cuts come as CZI is stepping “a little further back from its original focus areas of education, criminal justice reform, housing, and community development” and “now needs employees with expertise in their new coverage areas”.The laid off employees will get 60-days notice period along with a severance package with 16 weeks of base pay, health insurance, and a $10,000 stipend.Biohub is a nonprofit biomedical research organization founded by Chan and Zuckerberg to help scientists cure, prevent, or manage all diseases by the end of the century. Established in 2016 Biohub is a key part of CZI and has an operating budget of about $1 billion per year. Since its inception, the couple has donated $4 billion to basic science research, and aims to double it in the next decade.Speaking during an event at the Biohub Imaging Institute in Redwood City in November last year, Zuckerberg said “I feel like the science work that we’ve done, the Biohub model in particular, has been the most impactful thing that we have done”. “So we want to really double down on that. Biohub is going to be the main focus of our philanthropy going forward,” quoted an Associated Press report then.In a November 2025 blog post, the couple wrote “We will continue our other philanthropic efforts as well, but the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative will serve as infrastructure and support for our initiatives. There will be many challenges, but we believe that achieving some of humanity’s long-term dreams will also come within reach.”In a related news, Bill Gates has started putting in place the first major steps toward closing the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the world’s most-influential philanthropic organisation. The foundation’s board has approved a cap on operating costs, limiting them to $1.25 billion a year, or about 14% of its budget. To meet that limit, the organisation will reduce its workforce by 500, including by leaving some positions unfilled.","The chan zuckerberg initiative (czi) has cut roughly 8% of its workforce.

Key Things to Remember



Messaging apps have become essential tools for staying connected with family, friends, and colleagues. WhatsApp, one of the most widely used messaging platforms, can quickly accumulate numerous conversations, making it challenging to locate important chats among hundreds of messages. To address this issue, WhatsApp offers a built-in feature that lets users pin up to 3 conversations to the top of their chat list for quick access.For Android device users, the process is straightforward. Open WhatsApp and navigate to the Chats tab. Press and hold the chat you want to pin, then tap the pin icon in the top menu bar that appears. The chat will move to the top with a small pin symbol next to it. The pinned chat will remain at the top of your chat list, even if new messages arrive in other conversations.For iPhone users, the process differs slightly. Open WhatsApp and find the chat you want to pin. Swipe right on the chat and tap the Pin button that appears. The chat will be locked to the top of your list, staying there and remaining easily accessible whenever you open WhatsApp.If you want to unpin a chat, the process is equally simple. On Android, press and hold the pinned chat, then tap the unpin icon that appears in the top menu.On iPhone, swipe right on the pinned chat and tap the Unpin button.WhatsApp lets users pin up to three chats so important conversations stay at the top of the chat list.

The auction opens as part of Dubai’s long-running tradition of celebrating car culture, personal expression and prestige on the emirate’s roads.Dubai’s RTA has announced that 300 premium number plates will be offered in the 82nd online auction, featuring 2-, 3-, 4- and 5-digit combinations suitable for private cars, classic vehicles and motorcycles.

The auction will remain open for seven days only. All sales are subject to a 5 per cent Value Added Tax (VAT) and participation is open to residents who hold an active traffic file in Dubai.To join the auction, potential bidders must pay a Dh5,000 security cheque payable to RTA and a non-refundable Dh120 registration fee.Registration can be completed online via the RTA website or in person at Customer Happiness Centres in areas such as Umm Ramool, Al Barsha and Deira. Successful bidders have 10 working days after the auction closes to complete payment, in cash for amounts up to Dh50,000 or by manager’s cheque or credit card for larger sums.Dubai’s vehicle number plates are more than just identifiers. They have become symbols of status, individuality and even investment potential. Unique or easily memorable combinations, especially those with fewer digits, often command strong interest and high bids from collectors, car enthusiasts and business owners alike. Last year’s auctions illustrate just how lucrative and competitive these events can be: distinctive numbers have historically sold for millions of dirhams, with some rare plates like AA17 fetching over Dh8 million and total auction revenues reaching into the tens of millions.These auctions not only give buyers the chance to stand out on the roads but also reflect an evolving luxury culture where plates are viewed as status symbols, similar to personalised accessories or exclusive registrations seen in other global cities.

Online automotive forums and owner communities frequently discuss the value of certain plates, noting that 4-digit and 3-digit numbers tend to retain value better and can sometimes be resold through private deals when market demand is high.For many residents, winning a premium plate is not only about personal identity on the road, it can also be a status milestone reflecting years in the city, business success or even cultural significance when specific numbers have special meaning in local or global contexts.Dubai’s plate auctions have a track record of remarkable sales and strong interest from the public. For instance, a previous auction saw the plate AA17 sell for Dh8.02 million, contributing to total auction revenues of over Dh69 million. Other combinations also commanded high bids, showing that the market for distinctive plates can be robust, especially when collectors target rare sequences.These historical successes set the stage for high expectations in the 2026 auction.

Final thoughts: Is this the best Hero Goblins deck in Clash Royale?

Fast-cycle decks remain effective in 2026 because they create steady pressure without forcing heavy elixir commitments. This is one of the best Hero Goblins deck in Clash Royale and it uses the new card and Evo Goblin Barrel to pull out enemy spells early and convert small advantages into tower damage.The focus is not on large pushes. Instead, the deck relies on quick rotations and repeated chip damage. Players who track spells well and know the right time to push will get consistent value from this build.• Average elixir cost: ~3.1 - A fast spell-bait control deck built to out-cycle opponents and apply steady chip pressure.As one of the best Hero Goblins deck in Clash Royale, it follows two clear ideas: force spells early, then punish the opponent once their rotation is exposed.Hero Goblins, Ice Spirit, Log, and Princess allow cheap rotations. Opponents often spend spells to prevent damage, which creates openings for Evo Goblin Barrel or Miner. Evo Cannon also attracts spells. If it is removed quickly, you usually gain an elixir advantage that can be turned into a counter-push (unless they have Earthquake).This is not a rush deck. Control the lane with Evo Cannon and Mighty Miner, defend efficiently, and attack after you stabilize.Most damage will come from Princess chip and Barrel connections rather than one large push. If the Mighty Miner makes it to the tower, he can do a lot of damage if his drill is not countered. Rocket becomes important once the tower is low enough to finish.Place Hero Goblins at the bridge or near ongoing pressure to bait small spells. When they are eliminated, a Brigade Banner stays active for seven seconds. Using the ability during that time spawns four more Goblins around the banner.Try to place the banner close to the enemy tower. Many players will use Log, Arrows, or Fireball immediately. If they do not respond, add Evo Goblin Barrel or Miner with Ice Spirit on the same lane to increase pressure.Evo Goblin Barrel drops three Goblins anywhere in the arena and appears twice in the evolution cycle, making it harder to defend repeatedly.A simple pattern works well:• Place Princess in one lane to draw a spell.• Send Evo Goblin Barrel once the spell is out of rotation.Hero Goblins can also act as a fake threat. If the opponent uses Zap or Log on them, the real Barrel becomes harder to stop.Evo Cannon should usually be placed on your side of the bridge so it has time to damage incoming units such as Hog Rider, Miner, or distract flying units like the Balloon, Lavahound, and more.Goblin Barrel and Ice Spirit form a reliable chip combination. The Barrel bypasses buildings, while Ice Spirit slows defenders long enough for extra hits. If the opponent spends too much elixir stopping the Barrel, attack the opposite lane with Mighty Miner and Hero Goblins (you can also use a Princess-Hero Goblins push).Princess, Hero Goblins, and Log create a 7-elixir rotation that can be repeated often.Example sequence:• Princess at the bridge forces a response.• Opponent uses Arrows or Log.• Deploy Hero Goblins in the other lane.• If they Zap the Goblins, clear their support troop with Log.• Cycle back to Princess and repeat.This pattern builds steady pressure and limits the opponent’s ability to attack.Rocket should be saved for key moments rather than used early.Typical uses include:• Finishing the tower once it drops near 1,000 HP after repeated chip damage.• Removing support troops during a large push while also damaging the tower.Defend first, then Rocket if it provides clear value.Use Evo Cannon as the main defensive structure. While the tank moves forward, pressure the opposite lane with Goblin Barrel and Ice Spirit, then support with Princess to force spells. Once those spells are used, punish with Evo Goblin Barrel or Hero Goblins. Once this push is cleared, you can use the Mighty Miner as a tank and activate the banner to get an extra four Goblins.Cannon placement is important. Set it slightly above the king tower so it distracts hard-hitting units like the Hog away from the tower. Use Log on swarms, then apply pressure with Hero Goblins in the other lane to stay ahead in cycle. If the opponent overspends breaking through your defense, Rocket becomes a safe tower hit.This deck cycles faster than many traditional bait lists. Play carefully early. Let opponents use spells on Evo Cannon or Hero Goblins before committing to offense. Once their rotation is clear, push with Mighty Miner, Princess, and Evo Goblin Barrel together.Avoid unnecessary aggression. Patience usually leads to better openings.Use them mainly to force spells. Their banner creates another chance to apply pressure, so letting them fall is often acceptable.Because it appears twice in the cycle, timing matters. Deploy it when spells are unavailable or when Rocket can secure the game if damage connects.Do not place it directly next to the tower. Positioning it closer to the centre on your side of the arena increases its value against tanks.A dependable defensive unit that can turn into a counter-push. Pair it with Ice Spirit for protection against swarms and use Princess to support the lane.The most reliable card in the deck for cycling and chip damage. Use her often to draw spells before committing to Barrel attacks.Hero Goblins fit naturally into fast spell-bait decks like this one. It may not have the highest win rate in the current meta, but it is effective for players who prefer controlled matches and steady pressure. Success with this deck depends on how well you can play bait decks. Your ability to manage elixir is also important along with counting card cycle of your enemy.","Best hero goblins deck in clash royale - list, stats, and average elixir cost.

Kick reverses Nick Fuentes ’ partnership without explanation





Nicholas J. Fuentes, a prominent online streamer, revealed that his Kick Partnership Program approval was abruptly reversed just days after it was granted. Fuentes announced on X that his application for Kick’s partnership program was approved on Wednesday but, by the following Monday, Kick terminated his account from the program without giving any explanation. He claims to average 35,000–40,000 viewers per night, which would make him one of the top streamers on the platform. The sudden reversal has left Fuentes and his followers surprised and sparked discussions in streaming communities about Kick’s opaque and inconsistent partnership policies.The case brings to light the concerns regarding transparency in Kick’s partnership program. Many content creators have come forward about their accounts being suddenly restricted or denied/reverted without any reason or explanation from the platform. In Fuentes’ case, the sudden change occurs despite his high viewership, which is usually a prerequisite for inclusion in such programs. The uncertainty surrounding the reason for the decision has led to discussions on the platform’s treatment of its content creators.Fuentes shared the timeline of events publicly, his partnership was approved on Wednesday, and by Monday, February 2, 2026, it had been terminated.He posted the exact text of his announcement on X to highlight how quickly the reversal occurred. While Kick has not offered a public reason, this kind of sudden action is not unheard of on emerging streaming platforms that are still defining their policies. Many users and creators pointed out that such moves can be confusing for top-performing streamers and can affect trust in the platform.This controversy has also led to discussions on communication and moderation strategies employed by Kick. Streamers who depend on partnership benefits, such as monetization and support, are usually affected when sudden reversals happen. In this scenario, the communication of the events by Fuentes highlights how quickly things can change, even for a streamer with a massive following.In light of the above, the fact that Nick Fuentes was kicked out of Kick’s partnership program just days after approval is a clear indication of the challenges that content creators face on new streaming platforms. Although the platform has not given a reason for the ban, this is yet another case that has sparked debate on the issues of transparency, fairness, and treatment of content creators.","Nick fuentes, a prominent online streamer, revealed that his kick partnership program approval was abruptly reversed just days after it was granted.

Who built Jmail and what they were trying to prove

How the inbox changes the reading experience





Sifting through large document dumps is usually a tedious exercise, even when the material is of major public interest. That has been the case with emails linked to Jeffrey Epstein, which have circulated in the public domain as scanned PDFs, plain text files, and images released through court cases and official disclosures. A recent web project changes that experience entirely. Instead of forcing readers to jump between files, it presents the emails inside a familiar, Gmail-style interface, making the archive feel like a real inbox and turning a messy collection of documents into something far easier to explore, search, and understand.The project, known as Jmail, recreates the look and behaviour of Google’s email service while relying only on material that is already public. There is no new data and no private access involved. The aim is usability rather than revelation: to make existing records readable without specialist tools or hours of manual sorting.Jmail was created by Riley Walz, described by Wired as a prankster and internet artist, working alongside web developer Luke Igel. Rather than treating the Epstein emails as raw evidence to be mined for new revelations, the pair approached them as both a technical challenge and a cultural problem.Their central question was not what the emails contained, but how the way information is presented shapes who engages with it and who does not.The creators have framed Jmail as an experiment in accessibility. Public records, they argue, are often technically available but practically unusable, buried in fragmented files that discourage close reading. By rebuilding the archive in a familiar format, they sought to expose the gap between transparency in principle and transparency in practice.The interface mirrors the conventions of a standard email client. Messages are clearly divided between sent and received folders, conversations are grouped into threads, and a search bar allows users to look up names, dates, and keywords instantly. These small design decisions dramatically alter how the material can be navigated. Instead of skimming isolated documents, users can follow patterns of correspondence and timelines with minimal friction.For journalists and researchers, this reduces the time spent on basic organisation and increases the time available for analysis. For general readers, the familiar layout removes the intimidation factor that often accompanies large document dumps, making engagement more likely.Although the presentation can feel provocative, Jmail functions primarily as a research aid rather than a stunt. It does not introduce new information or private data, nor does it claim to reveal hidden material. Its significance lies in how it demonstrates that interface design can influence whether public records are ignored, misunderstood, or meaningfully examined.",The project recreates the look and behaviour of google’s email service while relying only on material that is already public.

Travel between the UAE and India is becoming dramatically more affordable in 2026, thanks to a massive promotional fare sale launched by Air India Express, a Tata Group-owned low-cost carrier. The airline’s new “Xpress More Sale” has opened bookings this week with one-way base fares from as low as AED 320 (about Dh350) on UAE–India routes. The move is expected to benefit millions of commuters, expatriate families and budget travellers through nearly the entire year.Air India Express kicked off its Xpress More Sale on February 01, with discounted bookings available until February 05. Travel under these promotional fares is valid from February 11 through December 31, 2026, offering travellers a long booking window to plan trips home, for holidays, business or visits around festivals and school breaks.The sale covers both domestic and international routes, with over five million seats up for grabs across the airline’s network. Passengers who book through the airline’s website and mobile app also enjoy zero convenience fees and one free date change, providing extra flexibility for long-term itinerary adjustments.For travellers flying from the UAE, Air India Express has introduced competitively priced Lite fares, the most affordable ticket category that excludes checked baggage but can be upgraded later. Starting base prices include -These discounted fares present a big opportunity for budget-conscious expatriates, students and frequent flyers who make regular trips between the Gulf and the Indian subcontinent.The UAE–India travel corridor is one of the busiest in global aviation, driven by trade, tourism, family travel and the large Indian expatriate community based in the Gulf.Air India Express’ sale comes at a time when travellers are facing rising costs across hospitality and flights, making Dh350-level pricing a rare and attractive offer. Industry analysts say ultra-low fares like these not only boost travel demand but can also stimulate broader tourism, cultural exchange and economic linkages between the UAE and India, especially in shoulder and off-peak seasons. By offering lower entry prices, airlines can fill more seats and encourage travel that might otherwise be postponed.Here are some practical tips for travellers looking to take advantage of the sale -Air India Express operates more than 500 daily flights across a network that links India, the Gulf, South Asia and Southeast Asia. The airline’s pricing strategy reflects growing competition in the region’s aviation sector, where carriers are trying to balance affordable travel with profitability and network expansion.By launching large inventory promotions like the Xpress More Sale, especially with no convenience fees and date-change flexibility, the airline aims to appeal to frequent flyers, long-haul travellers and families who might previously have opted for premium carriers. With major events, economic recovery and increased global mobility expected in 2026, budget airfare promotions are likely to shape travel behaviour for millions.From visiting parents and students to exploring tourism opportunities within India and the Gulf, sales like these can make travel far more accessible. As airlines across the region continue to compete with aggressive pricing, travellers stand to benefit from increased options and lower cost barriers, a trend that industry watchers say may persist through the year.Air India Express’s Xpress More Sale, offering India–UAE fares from as low as Dh320 and travel validity through the end of 2026, is shaping up to be one of the most talked-about airline promotions for Gulf expats and travellers this year.

In a significant regulatory crackdown, Saudi Arabia ’s Ministry of Hajj and Umrah has announced the suspension of contracts with 1,800 foreign travel agencies engaged in the Umrah pilgrimage sector after a performance review revealed serious shortcomings in service quality and compliance with approved standards. The move, announced on February 01, 2026, affects nearly one-third of the estimated 5,800 agencies operating across the globe but officials say that it will not disrupt services for pilgrims with existing visas or confirmed bookings.According to the Saudi Press Agency and ministry officials, the suspension came after a routine evaluation uncovered widespread deficiencies in service delivery and performance among many foreign Umrah operators.The Ministry has given the affected agencies a 10-day window to address and correct these issues, after which their contracts could be reinstated if they meet the required standards.Ministry spokesperson Ghassan Alnwaimi emphasised that enforcing approved classification criteria and performance benchmarks is essential to improving compliance among service providers, strengthening the reliability of the Umrah sector, and protecting pilgrims’ rights.The ministry clarified that pilgrims holding valid visas or confirmed reservations will not be affected by the suspension.Their travel services including visas, accommodation and transportation are expected to continue without interruption as usual. Importantly, the suspension applies only to the issuance of new visas and contract renewals. Agencies that quickly fix their compliance issues within the grace period could see their contracts reactivated and resume issuing new visas afterward.This regulatory move is part of broader efforts by the Saudi government to professionalise the Umrah travel ecosystem and align services with international standards. Saudi authorities have increasingly emphasised quality, transparency and accountability in the pilgrimage travel sector, a crucial component of the Kingdom’s broader tourism and religious initiatives under Vision 2030.Analysts note that tighter oversight helps build trust among global Muslim pilgrims, ensures that agencies uphold contractual obligations and reduces instances of fraud or poor service that can harm the Kingdom’s reputation as the guardian of Islam’s two holiest sites.Umrah, the shorter duration pilgrimage to Mecca that can be performed year-round, has grown significantly in recent years, drawing millions of visitors from countries across Asia, Africa and the Middle East . With millions of pilgrims relying on foreign travel agencies to arrange logistics, visas and hospitality, the quality of service provided is a key element of the overall pilgrim experience.Issues like accommodation problems, transport failures and misleading service packages have previously prompted targeted suspensions and regulatory actions by the ministry against erring operators. A separate suspension in late 2025 targeted agencies that failed to secure promised accommodation for arriving pilgrims, illustrating the ministry’s consistent enforcement approach.Reactions from affected agencies and external stakeholders have been mixed. Some welcome the enforcement as a necessary step toward improving operational standards, while others warn that sudden regulatory pressure could strain smaller operators who lack the technical infrastructure to meet rigorous performance benchmarks.Pilgrims, meanwhile, have largely expressed relief that existing bookings and visas remain unaffected, reducing concerns about disrupted journeys at a time of high Umrah demand. Many social media users and Umrah travel communities have taken to online forums to share advice on choosing accredited agencies and emphasise the importance of planning through official channels to avoid potential issues.Agencies now face a tight deadline to rectify compliance issues including service quality, documentation and classification criteria, if they hope to resume issuing new visas. The ministry has made it clear that failure to meet standards within the 10-day grace period could see further regulatory action, including continued suspension or even permanent contract termination.Officials also said that the ministry will continue using monitoring and evaluation tools to track agency performance and strengthen the Umrah ecosystem. This could include more frequent reviews, surprise inspections and stricter metrics to uphold service standards for future pilgrims. For Saudi authorities, the suspension is not punitive but corrective and aimed at ensuring that foreign travel agencies uphold the quality, reliability and transparency that pilgrims deserve.With Umrah traffic rising and global competition among travel providers intensifying, Saudi Arabia’s regulatory stance signals a new era of accountability and excellence in pilgrimage travel services. In short, Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Hajj and Umrah has suspended 1,800 foreign travel agencies’ contracts after identifying performance and compliance issues, giving them a short window to improve or face further action. While pilgrims with valid visas remain protected, the move reflects a broader push to elevate service standards and safeguard the rights of millions of Umrah performers worldwide.","Saudi arabia suspends 1,800 umrah travel agencies over service quality.
