Practical tech tips offer help in everyday & critical situations

It’s not every day that one wakes up to an email with ‘I need your help’ in the subject line.Morning mailers are usually a yawn. That daily newsletter, the five things “you must not miss”, new podcast notification, a bill payment reminder, a delivery alert, they’ve crowded your inbox even before you’ve started your day.So, this one stood out, more so because the sender was a stranger. Not a trick email, not a scam bait, this was a genuine request for help. A woman from Mumbai had written in, seeking advice and guidance.A day before the email landed, we had published a ‘Hack of the Day’ on how to get free legal aid through the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) portal. She had seen it. This wasn’t just a tech hack for her.The hack had done two things — allowed her to file a plea for help without stepping out of home and assured her of legal remedy for which she would not have to pay.Since we started ‘Hack of the Day’, published on the first page of Times Nation section Monday to Friday, the responses have surprised us. We conceived it as an espresso shot of technology, ‘a tech-presso’, to help our readers get practical solutions to everyday problems like blocking pesky telemarketing calls, downloading your IT return, knowing your credit score, deleting your Google location history, locking your Aadhaar biometrics, and so on.We didn’t reinvent the wheel. We merely curated available information but stripped off the jargon and cut the clutter to break it down into three-four simple tests. What we got from our readers in response went well beyond requests for further tips — those roll in daily and we’re happy to help. We heard many personal stories because the tech sits in middle of a problem and a solution.Problems present themselves differently to different people. For example, you may brush off a marketing call and block the number. Someone else, not so savvy with a phone, may fall into the trap of cybercrime. A reader from Indore reached out when he read our hack on ‘getting your phone into the DND’ – he was sick of calls from numbers he did not recognise on his phone and wanted them to stop. He read our hack but needed some handholding. “Maybe I’m too old to understand the hack,” he joked.Another hack on filing lost baggage claims with airlines drew responses that showed how fliers get shortchanged by a process that the aviation regulator has not bothered to simplify and airlines take advantage of. One reader said he was aware of the process but had received compensation far lower than the value of his damaged luggage.The most important thing we heard is that hacks have given our readers direction and agency in an environment where services are increasingly digital and solutions lie buried in creases of web pages. In moments of vulnerability, a small, well-explained piece of information can become a turning point.","Since we started ‘hack of the day’, published on the first page of times nation section monday to friday, the responses have surprised us.

IndiGo Crisis: Inside Pilot Shortage, Rule Change and Winter Delays Behind Over 200 Cancellations

IndiGo CEO Pieter Elbers has written to employees acknowledging the severe disruptions that have hit the airline in recent days, conceding that IndiGo “could not live up to the promise” of providing a good travel experience to passengers.The carrier has seen more than 300 flight cancellations on Thursday alone, with scores of services delayed as operational challenges mounted.In the internal message, Elbers said the past few days had been “difficult for many of our IndiGo customers and colleagues”, noting that the airline serves close to 3.8 lakh customers daily but had failed to meet expectations.“We could not live up to that promise these past days and we have publicly apologised for that,” he said.Elbers attributed the crisis to a mix of “minor technology glitches, schedule changes, adverse weather conditions, heightened congestion in the aviation ecosystem, and the implementation of the newly released FDTL norms”, which “compounded negatively to create a cascading impact on our operations”.He expressed gratitude to pilots, cabin crew, engineers, OCC, customer support, digital teams and airport staff who have been working “tirelessly to manage the situation, minimise the impact, and restore stability as quickly as possible”.As per PTI, IndiGo’s on-time performance had plunged to 19.7 per cent on December 3, underlining the scale of the disruption.Elbers told staff that given the size and complexity of IndiGo’s network, disruptions “grow large immediately” and require interventions at multiple levels. “Our immediate goal is to normalise our operations and bring punctuality back on track in the coming days, which is not an easy target,” he wrote.The DGCA has summoned IndiGo’s senior management to explain the unprecedented nationwide disruptions and present a corrective plan.The airline has already initiated “calibrated adjustments” to its schedules for the next 48 hours to stabilise operations, according to its official statement.Elbers, in his letter, urged employees to come together as one team, recalling how IndiGo recently completed the upgrade of 200 A320 aircraft within 24 hours. “I am confident we all can deal with this challenge too… Together, as one team, we will overcome this challenge and emerge even stronger,” he said.","Indigo ceo pieter elbers has written to employees acknowledging the severe disruptions that have hit the airline in recent days.

Why Shedeur Sanders became one of Google’s most searched people in 2025

Okay, so at this point we all need to admit that Shedeur Sanders isn’t just a quarterback, he’s genuinely one of the biggest entertainment figures of the year. And now Google has basically stamped that fact in bold print. When the company dropped its “Year in Search 2025” data, Shedeur showed up as one of the top trending people worldwide. Like… not top trending athlete. Not top trending football player. One of the top trending humans. If you needed proof that Shedeur is the internet’s main character, here you go.When Google revealed its “Trending People” rankings which track the fastest-rising search spikes of the year, Shedeur Sanders pulled up at No. 6 globally. And honestly, that tells you everything about his impact this year. Google searches are basically the world’s scoreboard for curiosity, and his number was skyrocketing every time something happened in Colorado. Whether it was games, drama, luxury Instagram posts, or Coach Prime headlines, Shedeur’s name just kept dominating the timeline.For anyone new to how Google does this list, it’s not about who is the most famous, it’s about whose name exploded in search traffic. And in 2025, Shedeur was exactly that. He didn’t just make the list; he doubled down by becoming Google’s No. 1 trending athlete of the entire year. That’s above every NFL star, every NBA MVP candidate, and every Olympian.A big part of this is the Prime Effect. Colorado football lived in the media cycle nonstop, and every time Coach Prime talked, the internet listened. Shedeur naturally became the center of that attention, the quarterback, the face of the team, the one dropping viral quotes and highlight plays.There wasn’t a single month where Shedeur wasn’t trending for something.A clutch fourth-quarter comeback? Trending.Rocking a luxury watch and custom Rolls Royce? Trending.Sitting courtside next to celebrities? Trending.Posting a random Instagram story? Somehow still trending.He became a true crossover figure, sports fans searched him, casual viewers searched him, even people who didn’t watch college football searched him just to keep up with the culture. NIL deals, fashion style, viral press conferences, Shedeur basically became a content machine.And with every pop-culture moment, Google searches followed.Also read - Odell Beckham Jr. selling cleats amid financial crisis but fans got the wrong pair","Shedeur sanders was one of google's most searched people in 2025.

Donna Kelce’s new acting journey in The Gift Exchange



Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce tried his hand at acting earlier this year, and now Donna Kelce is joining the fun with a holiday project of her own. The proud NFL mom revealed that she is starring in a new Christmas-themed collaboration with Google, and the announcement itself felt like something straight from a holiday film. On December 1, she posted a snowy and charming movie-style poster on Instagram, presenting herself in the heart of a festive town square while a couple exchanges gifts in front of her. Donna stood with a gentle smile, wearing a cozy sweater and clasping her hands in the warm glow of a classic seasonal moment.Her caption added a touch of anticipation. “#Google_Partner #sponsored Gather the family for a new holiday (and @google) classic. Trailer kicking off soon.” It was short, spirited and enough to send fans into a cheerful buzz. The poster design also played into that spirit. With rich red and green lettering, the film title The Gift Exchange, and the Google tie-in slogan “Searching for something unforgettable? Just ask Google. ” it delivered the full holiday sentiment many viewers adore.Donna takes on the role of Carole Hall in this project. She appears alongside WWE star Nikki Garcia as Holly Hall and Chicago Fire actor Taylor Kinney as Aiden Winter.In the poster, her character looks like the wise and kind observer, pleased to see a love story unfold before her. While Donna revealed no further specifics about the production, her post did suggest it might be a holiday short film or sponsored cinematic campaign. Either way, fans embraced it, calling for more Donna screen time.This moment marks more than entertainment. It reflects a personal chapter for Donna Kelce. Just recently, she shared on the Not Gonna Lie podcast that she once dreamed of aviation. “I did learn how to be a pilot before I had children,” said Donna on the Not Gonna Lie podcast. “So, I actually went up and flew a plane. I did [enjoy it], but you want to have children, and it was really expensive, so I had to stop.” She chose family life, earned an MBA from Baldwin Wallace University, completed studies at Ohio University, then worked three decades in banking as the “major breadwinner in the family. ”Her appearance in The Gift Exchange is not her first on camera. She also showed up in Hallmark productions like Holiday Touchdown: A Chiefs Love Story and Christmas on Call, and called her earlier acting experience “so awesome.” Donna is also preparing for the new season of The Traitors, which adds to her growing media presence. If Hallmark or Lifetime is looking for another warm-spirited lead, Donna Kelce may be ready for her next starring moment.Also Read: Stefon Diggs vs Cardi B net worth: Who’s richer between the Grammy-winning rapper or the Patriots’ star receiver",Kansas city chiefs tight end travis kelce tried his hand at acting earlier this year.

What Is Artificial Intelligence? Explained Simply With Real-Life Examples

Disruption will come from the unexpected





Take lessons from the dot-com era









Billionaire investor and Shark Tank judge Mark Cuban has now issued a warning to leading artificial intelligence companies including Perplexity, OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft and Meta. Cuban has argued that all these companies are overspending in the race to build the world’s most powerful AI model. As reported by Business Insider, speaking in the Pioneers of AI podcast, Cuban compared today’s AI arms race to the search engine boom of 1990s. The search engine boom ultimately ended with Google dominating the market and leaving all the rivals behind.“You’ve got five, six, whatever it is, companies that are trying to create the ultimate foundational model that we all depend on,” Cuban said. “It’s almost like in the ’90s when all the search engines were competing pre-Google… Now, we know with search engines it’s Google, and then there’s Bing, as, like, 1 or 2% and DuckDuckGo has got a half a percent. So it’s effectively a winner-take-all.”Like many other world leaders and analysts, Cuban has also cautioned that the massive investments done on AI could ultimately lead to the creation of a bubble. “They may be overspending,” he said.“And if they overspend or get too caught up, the bubble is in the competition between all those models because that could pop just like that with any new technology.”Along with this, he also raised concerns about the infrastructure costs behind AI, majorly the massive and expensive data centers which are being built to power large models. “I just can’t imagine over a 10-year period that we aren’t going to improve the technology enough that if you overspend on today’s technology, it just doesn’t feel right to me,” Cuban added.Cuban also emphasised that the disruption AI will not come from incremental improvements but from something “incredible” that no one sees coming. “Somebody’s going to come up with some incredible shit, right? If I knew what it was, I’d do it,” he said, suggesting that the current race may be blindsided by a breakthrough outside the existing competition.Cuban said he recognizes the same mix of hype, excitement, and overspending now playing out in AI. “They anticipate for at least another decade spending every penny they have,” he said of the major model developers. “I mean, if that’s not ripe for disruption to come up with better ways, I don’t know what is.”","Billionaire investor and shark tank judge mark cuban has issued a warning to leading artificial intelligence companies including perplexity, openai, anthropic, google, microsoft and meta.

"Thousands of Amazon employees send open letter to CEO Andy Jassy; say: We are the workers who develop, train, and use AI, so we have ...",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/thousands-of-amazon-employees-send-open-letter-to-ceo-andy-jassy-say-were-the-workers-who-develop-train-and-use-ai-so-we-have-/articleshow/125646835.cms,"Over 1,000 Amazon employees have penned an open letter to CEO Andy Jassy, expressing grave concerns about the company's rapid AI development. They argue this ""warp-speed approach"" prioritizes AI investments over climate commitments and human workforce well-being, potentially harming democracy, jobs, and the environment.

Amazon Launches Largest Layoff Drive Yet, Cutting 30,000 Corporate Positions to Boost Efficiency

Here's the complete open letter from Amazon 1000-plus employees:

Dear Andy Jassy and S-team,

In recent years, tech leaders have accelerated their race to build the most powerful AI first. “Sink or swim,” “AI is not going anywhere,” and “work with it or be replaced” have become mantras in workspaces at Amazon and beyond.

We, the undersigned Amazon employees, have serious concerns about this aggressive rollout during the global rise of authoritarianism and our most important years to reverse the climate crisis. We believe that the all-costs-justified, warp-speed approach to AI development will do staggering damage to democracy, to our jobs, and to the earth.

We’re the workers who develop, train, and use AI, so we have a responsibility to intervene. Here’s why we’re sounding the alarm:

Amazon is casting aside its climate goals to build AI. We have just a few years to stop disastrous levels of warming.

Yet despite committing to net zero carbon emissions by 2040, Amazon’s annual emissions have grown roughly 35% since 2019. The AI race is widening this gap. The company plans to spend $150 billion building new data centers for AI. Many of these will be in drought-stressed regions, where they will consume scarce water, or in locations where their energy demands will force utility companies to keep coal plants online or build new gas plants.

Amazon even killed legislation that would have required its data centers to use clean energy. Meanwhile, AWS is helping oil companies drill for more oil and gas.

Amazon is forcing us to use AI while investing in a future where it’s easier to discard us. Andy Jassy promised that soon Amazon will be full of AI tools and “agents,” and that he expects to employ fewer humans. He claims our (remaining) jobs will be “even more exciting and fun,” but here’s what we’re actually experiencing: higher expected output and shorter timelines, mandates to build AI tools for wasteful use cases, and massive investment in AI with little investment in career advancement.

Our logistics coworkers have been especially impacted by work speedups, surveillance, injuries and burnout. All this, while Amazon is attempting to declare the National Labor Relations Board, which protects workers’ rights, unconstitutional.

Amazon is helping build a more militarized surveillance state with fewer protections for ordinary people. Amazon, alongside Meta, Microsoft and Google lobbied to ban state regulation on AI for the next ten years; Trump financially disincentivized state regulatory action in his AI Action Plan. Trump demanded an end to “wokeness” in AI; Amazon has scaled back its commitments to DEI and offered the administration a 1 billion dollar coupon for AWS, with a DOGE staffer calling the deal “a foundational piece to help implement President Trump’s AI Action Plan.” The military wants AI technologies at top speed; Amazon has announced a collaboration with an autonomous weapons software company. Trump’s ICE Director wants to run mass deportation “like Prime, but with human beings”; Amazon, a major provider of cloud services to DHS and to Palantir, literally does power mass deportation. Amazon is expanding the surveillance state in other ways, too. It’s making Ring AI-first and re-introducing a tool for police to request footage; it’s using AI to surveil warehouse workers, and, of course, its own customers. Finally,

Jeff Bezos

owns The Washington Post, and has begun asserting more control over that publication; the other major AI players control mass information ecosystems like Instagram and X. If these collaborations continue, we will be ceding an unbelievable amount of power into the hands of an increasingly authoritarian government and a few companies willing to abandon any principles they claim to have in the race for AI dominance.

All of this is daunting, but none of it is inevitable. A better future is still very much within reach, but it requires us to get real about the costs of AI and the guardrails we need.

We demand Amazon leadership commit to the following:

No AI with dirty energy.

No more vague promises that “AI will solve the climate crisis.” Amazon must implement a public plan that includes: 1) powering all data centers with 100% additional, local renewable energy, 24/7, 2) ending custom AI solutions for oil & gas companies to drill more oil faster, and 3) publishing a detailed, science-backed glidepath for how it will meet its climate commitments.

No AI without employee voices.

We want ethical AI working groups of non-managers across the company that will have significant ownership over org-level goals and how or if AI should be used in their orgs, how or if AI-related layoffs or headcount freezes are implemented, and how to mitigate or minimize the collateral effects of AI use, such as environmental impact.

No AI for violence, surveillance, or mass deportation.

Amazon sells a huge range of products and services — from physical goods to digital infrastructure to films to medical services. It should not need to be helping surveil civilians in Gaza, collaborating with AI companies that specialize in drone warfare, or supporting a mass deportation machine.

The Amazon employees signing this letter believe in building a better world — not in building bunkers to fall back to. We want the promised gains from AI to give everyone more freedom to play and rest, to spend time with family and friends, to be moved by nature, to create, to feel safe being who we are.

This is an incredibly consequential moment in history. It’s time for us to step up and spark a conversation about the real benefits and costs of AI. Workers have guided Amazon to a better path before, and we can do it again. The choices we make now, for the planet, for its people and animals, matter more than ever. Let’s make ones we can be proud of.

Signed,

1,039 Amazon employees (and counting!)





Thousands of Amazon employees have signed an open letter issuing to CEO Andy Jassy . The letter warns the company about its 'rapid' move toward AI. Signed by more than 1,000 Amazon workers (and counting), the open letter calls out Amazon for pushing its AI investments at the expense of climate and human workforce. The letter’s supporters come from a wide array of roles at the company, including many software engineers, and even employees focused on building AI systems. ""We believe that the all-costs-justified, warp-speed approach to AI development will do staggering damage to democracy, to our jobs, and to the earth,” the letter’s authors wrote. It adds, “We’re the workers who develop, train, and use AI, so we have a responsibility to intervene.”The open letter is reported to have been signed by Amazon workers anonymously, and comes almost a month after the ecommerce giant announced mass layoff plans as it increases adoption of AI in its operations. Among the signatories are employees in a range of positions, including engineers, product managers and warehouse associates. The letter argues that their employer is throwing out its climate promises in the scramble to win the AI race.Amazon has pledged to reach net-zero carbon emissions by 2040, pointing to efficiencies from electric delivery vehicles and reduced plastic packaging in its climate commitment.","Over 1,000 amazon employees have penned an open letter to ceo andy jassy, expressing grave concerns about the company's rapid ai development.

Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has revealed his annual holiday reading list as the 2025 comes to a close. Gates has recommended five books and he believes that all these titles spark curiosity and reflection during the quieter days of the winter season. “Each of these books pulls back the curtain on how something important really works: how people find purpose later in life, how we should think about climate change, how creative industries evolve, how humans communicate,” wrote Gates.In the blog post, Gates has also explained that holidays are the perfect tome to slow down and also catch up on reading. “There’s something about the quieter days around the holidays that makes it easier to sit down with a good book,” he wrote. His list on 2025 book recommendations reflects on his fascination with how the world works and how you can start a great conversation.The book belongs to the fiction genre and its a story of an aging janitor and a wise octopus captive hime with its empathy and storytelling. “Van Pelt's story made me think about the challenge of filling the days after you stop working—and what communities can do to help older people find purpose,” said Gates.The books explains about the climate challenges. The book structures 50 big questions on climate change, nuclear power and renewables. “ I’ve followed Hannah’s work at Our World in Data for years, and her new book is one of the clearest explanations of the climate challenge I’ve read. She’s realistic about the risks but grounded in data that shows real progress,” said Gates.It is a memoir which recounts the Diller’s extraordinary career in Hollywood, media, and technology, blending personal anecdotes with reflections on power, risk-taking, and the evolution of entertainment and digital industries. “He’s spent his life betting on ideas before they were obvious, and the industries he’s transformed show how much those bets can pay off,” said Gates.The book explains about the mysteries of human behaviour and how people communicate. “Although the topic itself is pretty complicated, the book is readable and practical, and it made me see everyday social interactions in a new light,” added Gate.The books offers a glimpse of at why America seems to struggle to build things and what it will take to fix that. The book argues that progress depends not just on good ideas but on the systems that help ideas spread.",Microsoft co-founder bill gates has revealed his annual holiday reading list as the 2025 comes to a close.

With a little organisation and a few smart habits, it is possible to reduce clutter and regain smooth performance in your inbox.Google provides an official Storage Manager that helps users see exactly what is taking up space across Gmail, Drive and Photos. The tool highlights large files, old emails with attachments and unnecessary items that can be deleted safely. It is the most reliable method since it works directly with data stored in the cloud rather than guessing what to remove.Gmail storage includes emails, sent items, drafts, attachments and everything stored in Google Drive and Google Photos. Even if the inbox does not appear full, large attachments or uploaded videos may be using most of the space.Promotional emails, newsletters, archived messages and old backups also count towards the total. Deleted items continue to occupy storage until they are permanently removed from Trash, which is why simply deleting emails does not always free space. When storage reaches its limit, Gmail stops receiving new mail and certain functions may not work correctly. Understanding what contributes to the total makes it easier to clean up effectively.When emails are deleted, they move to the Trash folder and stay there for up to 30 days before automatically disappearing. However, they still count towards your total storage until the Trash is emptied manually. The same rule applies to the Spam folder as well. By opening each folder and choosing the option to permanently delete all items together, users can often free up a surprising amount of valuable storage space almost instantly.Attachments are usually the biggest contributors to storage use. Gmail provides search filters that help locate bulky messages. Searching for terms like has: attachment larger:10M displays emails with attachments larger than 10 megabytes. Once these are found, they can be deleted in bulk or downloaded elsewhere before deletion.Promotional categories often accumulate thousands of unread messages because newsletters, offers and automated campaigns pile up quickly without being noticed. These can be selected and removed together to clear storage space and improve inbox performance. If many emails come from the same sender, unsubscribing prevents future build-up and keeps incoming mail manageable by stopping unnecessary notifications permanently. Over time, this simple clean-up habit reduces digital clutter, improves focus and makes it easier to find important conversations without endless scrolling or searching.The Google One Storage Manager scans all the services linked to a Google account and lists files that consume the most space. It separates storage usage into sections such as large emails, deleted items, large files in Drive and backed-up photos or videos. This approach ensures that nothing is missed, especially when files outside Gmail are the primary cause of reduced space. Through a single interface, large items can be reviewed and removed safely without confusion.Regular maintenance avoids repeat storage problems. Clearing old attachments, emptying Trash frequently and reviewing large items every few months helps maintain free space. Avoiding the habit of emailing large files repeatedly can also help. Instead of attaching high-resolution photos and videos directly to emails, it is better to share links from Drive or alternative storage platforms. This allows senders to delete the original attachments without losing access to the files. Unsubscribing from mass mailing lists also helps maintain a clean inbox.For users dealing with intensive file exchange, such as designers, editors, photographers and students, the default free storage may not be enough. In such cases, upgrading to a paid Google One plan is a practical solution. Using two Google accounts is also an option, allowing heavier tasks to be separated from regular daily email.Clearing Gmail storage does not need to be complicated. With a structured approach and support from the official Google tools, anyone can free space quickly and enjoy uninterrupted messaging. Reducing unnecessary files keeps email performance fast, improves organisation and helps stay focused without clutter.A few minutes of clean up can restore full functionality and avoid the frustration of running out of space at the wrong moment. The best approach combines one-time clean-up with regular habits that prevent build-up in the future, keeping Gmail efficient and reliable.","Gmail storage can fill up quickly, especially if large files are attached.

Morgan Stanley has an overweight rating on JSW Steel with the target price at Rs 1,300. Analysts said that along with JFE's technological expertise, JSW is looking to leverage its project execution capabilities to participate in multi-decade growth opportunities. Under a new pact between JFE and JSW, JFE will invest about Rs 15,800 crore in two tranches for a 50% stake in a new entity BPSL), implying Rs 31,500 crore equity value for the new entity. JSW Steel will receive Rs 24,500 crore in cash for slump sale of its stake. JSW will also get Rs 7,900 crore through equity dilution on back of a share swap agreement with the promoter company that owns 17% of BPSL.HSBC has initiated its coverage of Tata Consumer Products with the target price at Rs 1,340. Analysts believe that the Tata Group’s flagship food & beverages company has a scope to expand and deepen distribution to drive growth. They forecast a 26% FY25-FY28 compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) for its growth portfolio, contributing 37% of the India revenue in FY28, from 28% in FY25. Analysts assigned premium 55x price-to-earnings multiple as they believe aggressive acquisitions and distribution will pay off.Motilal Oswal Securities has a buy on Aurobindo Pharma with the target price at Rs 1,430. Analysts said that the company’s broad-based growth momentum is building up. The company’s domestic Pen-G/6-APA manufacturing is positioned for healthy upside. Also, biosimilars, biologics CMO, and EU expansion drive diversification beyond legacy.CLSA has a hold on Kotak Mahindra Bank with the target price at Rs 2,350. Analysts raised the possibility of Kotak Bank buying IDBI Bank which the govt had said will divest. They feel such a deal would be earnings per share (EPS) accretive for the private sector lender, but may or may not address the excess capital issue and could possibly raise some HR issues. Analysts said IDBI Bank has a clean balance sheet, and a good deposit franchise. The value accretion for Kotak Bank would depend on how the purchase would be funded.Jefferies has an underperform rating on Dr Reddy’s Labs with the target price at Rs 1,130. Analysts met some top officials of the company. They said that the company remains confident of first wave launches in Canada, India and other emerging markets including in Brazil. The US FDA filing for biosimilar Abatacept, Dr Reddy's biggest asset, is on track this month with approval expected in 12-months. Its M&A strategy would focus on brands, not full companies.","Morgan stanley has an overweight rating on jsw steel with the target price at rs 1,300.

Candace Owens and Blake Neff disagreement over the livestream plan





Candace Owens is in a new fight after Turning Point USA (TPUSA) set a livestream time about Charlie Kirk ’s death without asking her first. This livestream was meant to answer her claims about TPUSA and the events around Charlie Kirk’s killing on September 10. Owens said she did not know TPUSA had already picked a date and time. She said she only saw it when it was posted on X.Then another twist came. Nick Fuentes jumped in and reacted to Owens backing out of the in-person meeting. He wrote on X:“You were invited to TPUSA HQ to press their leadership live and in person about their role in Charlie Kirk’s murder, but you can’t go because of a scheduling conflict? LOL. Isn’t this what you have been pushing for since September? Time to put up or shut up.”This made the story even louder online, as many people started asking why Owens was upset after she had already agreed to speak on the show.The fight started when Blake Neff of TPUSA posted the livestream details on X. He said the show would be on December 15 at 4 pm Eastern, and it would happen inside Charlie Kirk’s studio in Phoenix. He also said Candace Owens was welcome to join in person and should tell them by the end of the day.Owens did not like this at all. She said she was surprised that no one from TPUSA called or emailed her before making the plan public. She wrote, “Kind of weird how you didn’t e-mail or call me to ask about times or availability and chose to instead tweet this confirmation out at midnight.”She then asked why she was learning everything from X instead of from TPUSA directly. Owens also said the livestream time clashed with her daily live podcast. Still, she said she could join the show virtually if that was okay for TPUSA. She wrote, “Let’s lock it in?”Many of Owens’ supporters on X said TPUSA should have checked her time first, especially because they were the ones who invited her to clear the air.Now, people online are asking if she is backing out. Candace Owens says she is not. She says she only wants fair timing. The story keeps growing as both sides stand firm, and Nick Fuentes’ post has pushed even more eyes onto this fight.Also Read: Candace Owens Adds New Twist To TPUSA Invite As Her Backing Out Claims Rise Around The Charlie Kirk Livestream",Nick fuentes calls out candace owens after her tough talk does not match her tpusa move in charlie kirk case.

“Get shot on stream”: Asmongold fears Twitch could face a deadly crisis if ‘nuisance streamers’ continue to thrive,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/get-shot-on-stream-asmongold-fears-twitch-could-face-a-deadly-crisis-if-nuisance-streamers-continue-to-thrive/articleshow/125777747.cms,"Veteran creator Asmongold warns Twitch is nearing a breaking point due to ""nuisance streaming,"" where creators engage in reckless stunts and harassment for viral moments. He fears a tragic, potentially lethal, incident will occur if the platform doesn't crack down on this behavior, which he believes is rewarded by Twitch's current moderation policies.

Asmongold slams Twitch moderation and predicts someone will “get shot” on stream





Twitch has long been home to livestreaming chaos, but veteran creator Asmongold believes the platform is dangerously close to crossing a line. As IRL content continues to expand on streaming sites, some creators have begun broadcasting reckless stunts, harassment, theft, and public confrontations in pursuit of viral moments. For Asmongold, this trend is no longer just irresponsible, it’s potentially lethal.During a recent broadcast, he issued one of his most urgent warnings yet, arguing that Twitch has failed to crack down on “nuisance streaming” and will face tragic consequences if it doesn’t step in soon. His comments have ignited debate about whether the Amazon-owned platform is taking safety seriously enough, or waiting for something catastrophic to happen before acting.Asmongold’s frustration came to a head after the controversial streamer Nina Lin confessed to stealing from Target during a livestream, despite already being suspended for inappropriate conduct on Twitch. Calling her a “low-functioning psychopath” and accusing her of promoting “anti-social, destructive, obnoxious behavior,” he argued the platform is actively rewarding harmful broadcasts.“Eventually, what’s going to happen is you are going to have somebody get shot on stream,” he warned.“Somebody’s going to get beat up. If it’s the streamer, I guarantee you, nobody’s going to care. And when that happens, it’s completely on Twitch.”According to Asmongold, a deadly incident wouldn’t be surprising, it would be the result of inaction. He believes Twitch knows this behavior exists and still lets “nuisance streamers” profit from confrontation, creating what he called a “reward cycle” that encourages others to copy them in search of fame and monetization.He later took his concerns to X, clarifying that he doesn’t oppose IRL streaming as a category, only the deliberate harassment model that has flourished from it. “Twitch just needs to ban nuisance streaming,” he argued, describing the growing trend as creators “going to a public location, acting obnoxious to bait confrontation, then using it for content.”Twitch has historically reshaped rules in response to trending problems, but with tension escalating in public broadcasts, many believe the platform is now on a countdown. Whether Twitch listens to one of its most influential voices could determine the safety of its future content.Also Read: “She’s still rocking"": Perez Hilton weighs in on Stranger Things star Millie Bobby Brown’s official name change","Veteran creator asmongold warns twitch is nearing a breaking point due to ""nuisance streaming"" he fears a tragic, potentially lethal, incident will occur if the platform doesn't crack down on this behavior.

Four people have been arrested in South Korea for hacking more than 120,000 internet-connected surveillance cameras in homes and businesses and stealing footage to produce illegally filmed sexually exploitative content, the Washington Post reported citing officials.The Korean National Police Agency said the suspects operated independently and targeted a variety of IP cameras, including those in private homes, karaoke rooms, a pilates studio, and a gynaecologist’s clinic.Two of the suspects were responsible for more than 60% of the videos posted on an overseas-based website where the footage was sold. One suspect reportedly received around $24,000 in virtual assets for 545 videos, while another earned $12,000 for 648 videos. Another suspect allegedly hacked 70,000 cameras and sold 648 videos for 18 million won in virtual assets, the BBC reported.According to the NY Post, authorities have not disclosed the manufacturers of the hacked cameras. The website where the footage was sold, as well as those who viewed the videos, is also under investigation. Police have arrested three people suspected of purchasing or viewing the stolen material.One suspect is additionally charged with producing sexually exploitative content of children and adolescents, though police said this footage had been stored but not sold. All four are charged with hacking IP cameras, and two face further charges of selling illegally filmed sexual content.Authorities emphasised that weak passwords played a key role in the hack, with many cameras using simple or sequential combinations, making them vulnerable to cyberattacks. The National Police Agency urged all IP camera users to set complex, original passwords, update them regularly, and be cautious about using devices manufactured overseas, which may not meet local security standards.IP cameras, often used for monitoring children, pets, and businesses, have become popular globally due to their low cost but are increasingly targeted by hackers. Previous incidents include a 2019 US case in Mississippi where a man hacked a child’s Ring camera and harassed the child via the device’s two-way talk function, and a 2024 FTC fine on Verkada after footage from 150,000 cameras, including those in hospitals and schools, was stolen, reported The Washington Post.“Above all, it is crucial and effective for individual users who have installed IP cameras in homes or business premises to remain vigilant and immediately and regularly change their access passwords,” the BBC cited the National Police Agency as saying.According to the NY Post, South Korea has a long-standing problem with “molka,” or hidden cameras, which have been used to produce illegal sexual content in public spaces. Between 2011 and 2022, police made nearly 50,000 arrests related to illicit filming in hotels, pools, and public bathrooms. The widespread use of hidden cameras has also been a catalyst for the country’s feminist movement.Police have visited or notified victims at 58 locations, providing guidance on deleting footage and strengthening security. They are also cooperating with foreign authorities to investigate the website operator and users who accessed the stolen material. “IP camera hacking and illegal filming inflict immense suffering on victims and are therefore serious offences. We will eradicate them through vigorous investigations,” BBC quoted Park Woo-hyun, cyber investigation chief at the National Police Agency.","Four people have been arrested in south korea for hacking more than 120,000 internet-connected surveillance cameras in homes and businesses.

Australia’s government on Wednesday justified its social media ban for under-16s, arguing it will protect young people from being pulled into an online “purgatory.”“With one law, we can protect Generation Alpha from being sucked into purgatory by the predatory algorithms described by the man who created the feature as behavioural cocaine,” communications minister Anika Wells said, as cited by AFP.Australia is set to impose a ban from December 10, preventing users under 16 from accessing a range of major social media platforms and websites, including Facebook, Instagram, TikTok and YouTube.The eSafety Commissioner must be satisfied that social media platforms have taken “reasonable steps” to prevent users under 16 from holding accounts, or they could face fines of up to $49.5 million. The government has said the list of affected platforms is dynamic, meaning other services could be added later if young users shift to them and similar risks arise.The commissioner has indicated that platforms like Lemon8 could be added to the list and would be required to remove accounts for under-16 users.Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese has described social media as “a platform for peer pressure, a driver of anxiety, a vehicle for scammers and, worst of all, a tool for online predators.”Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, declined to disclose how it plans to identify users it “understands” to be under 16, saying doing so could potentially alert teens on how to bypass the ban.Snapchat said it will use account behavioural signals along with the birth dates provided on user accounts to identify those believed to be under 16.TikTok stated it will adopt a “multi-layered approach to age assurance” using “various technologies and signals” to verify users’ ages, adding that it will share further details ahead of December 10, as cited by the Guardian.YouTube on Wednesday criticised the ban and described the world-first legislation as “rushed” and unrealistic.""Most importantly, this law will not fulfil its promise to make kids safer online, and will, in fact, make Australian kids less safe on YouTube,"" YouTube public policy manager Rachel Lord stated, as cited by AFP.YouTube, one of the world’s most-visited websites, had initially been exempted from the ban so children could continue accessing educational content.However, in July, the Australian government reversed course, citing the need to protect young users from “predatory algorithms.”","Australia is set to impose a ban from december 10, preventing users under 16 from accessing a range of major social media platforms and websites.

""The term is defined as “online content deliberately designed to elicit anger or outrage by being frustrating, provocative, or offensive, typically posted in order to increase traffic to or engagement with a particular web page or social media content”.The term triumphed aura farming and biohack, which were also shortlisted.The term rage bait first appeared on Usenet in 2002, where it referred to a specific kind of driver’s irritated reaction after being flashed by someone trying to overtake them—planting the seed for the idea of intentional provocation.Over time, the term shifted into online slang, used to describe viral posts on social media and to criticise the broader ecosystem of platforms, creators, and trends that shape what gets published and promoted online.It’s now a staple term in global journalism and in the vocabulary of online creators. The strategy works, too: outrage reliably boosts clicks, especially in the realm of performative politics.As social platforms increasingly reward inflammatory posts, the tactic has escalated into what’s known as rage-farming—a more systematic effort to cultivate anger and drive engagement by repeatedly planting rage-bait material, often wrapped in misinformation or conspiracy-fueled narratives.","Rage bait has been crowned as the word of the year, 2025, by oxford university press.
