Celebrating small wins

This Energy Conservation Day: Don’t waste what you don’t use.

Every month, millions of Indian households pay for electricity they never actually use. The lights might be off, the fans switched down, but hidden leaks quietly drain energy, inflate bills, and add to the country’s carbon footprint. Unlike water dripping from a tap, electricity leaks have no sound, no puddle, no visible cue. So, it goes unnoticed and we don’t react. From chargers left in sockets to old appliances that hum non-stop, these silent drains often called “phantom loads” cost families thousands of rupees each year and contribute millions of tonnes of avoidable CO₂ emissions nationally.Meet Urja,On the surface, she seems like the poster child for energy consciousness. She turns off lights before leaving a room, switches off fans, monitors unnecessary usage, and genuinely believes she's doing more than her part. She even scolds her younger brother for leaving the kitchen light on. But the truth sits quietly in the corners of her home long after she’s stopped noticing.When you zoom in, cracks appear. Urja’s refrigerator, a sturdy 12-year-old unit that has probably watched her grow from a child to a working adult, gulps far more electricity than she imagines.She recently bought a new AC, but to save money, she picked a three-star model instead of the more efficient four- or five-star options. Her chargers, laptop, phone, tablet,and Wi-Fi stay permanently plugged into the socket because “it’s too much effort” to unplug them. The fridge door remains open while she chats about work gossip. Her microwave glows like a digital clock. And the TV? That one never gets unplugged, just in case she wants to switch it on “for background noise” while doomscrolling.Sounds familiar, doesn’t it? These are the small, invisible slips that quietly drain energy, money, and the planet.A problem cannot be solved without acknowledging that it exists in the first place. Habits cannot be unlearned without awareness of their silent effects. And wastage cannot be curbed in our homes and offices until we recognise the leaks, the ones hiding in our everyday appliances tthat urgently need fixing.Environmentalist Kavita Ashok calls these hidden electricity leaks “vampire energy” — the silent drain that happens even when appliances appear to be off.“Energy drains in homes have an interesting name —. I call it the phantom power used by household appliances when they’re left plugged in even when we aren’t using them. This is serious for our environment, as the CO₂ emissions from this alone account for nearly 1% of total emissions. It also reduces the lifespan of domestic appliances due to constant wear and tear More so the electricity bill shoots up by 5-10% by this unnecessary power consumption”Every year on December 14 , India observes National Energy Conservation Day , a moment meant not just to raise awareness but to remind citizens that energy efficiency is a shared responsibility. Introduced in 1991 and championed by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) , the day reflects India’s commitment to reducing unnecessary consumption and promoting sustainable practices and that is not possible without energy conservation which is the cornerstone of sustainable development.Energy conservation isn’t merely a matter of turning off lights. It’s about recognising deeper patterns in the devices we buy, how long we use them, how we maintain them, and the behaviours we normalise in our homes and institutions. The day calls for introspection: Are we actually conserving energy, or just feeling like we are?Because the hidden truth is that much of India’s electricity is wasted long before it lights a bulb or cools a room.A large part of India’s electricity silently disappears into what experts call “invisible drains” — electricity we pay for but never actually use. Somesh Kumar, partner and leader, Power & Utilities, EY India, explains that this loss can be grouped into three major categories: Phantom Loads, Inefficiency Losses, and Structural Leakage.Often termed “ghost power,” this refers to electricity drawn by appliances even when switched off. Set-top boxes, Wi-Fi routers, TVs, gaming consoles, and chargers continue consuming power silently to maintain internal clocks or remain ready for remote-control operation.This alone accounts for 5–10% of household electricity consumption , costing families Rs1,500–Rs3,000 annually and adding up to nearly Rs 200 billion nationally .Old or poorly maintained appliances such as air conditioners, refrigerators, fans, washing machines become energy-hungry over time. Dust-clogged filters, worn-out seals, and aging motors force them to work harder, increasing consumption by 10–15% in many households.Faulty wiring, old circuits, and leakage currents can silently inflate household electricity bills by around 9% . In offices and institutions, mis-calibrated systems, aging motors, and refrigerant leaks can push waste up to 12% of total consumption. All this occurs without any visible sign which makes it particularly dangerous.These quiet leaks are far more serious when placed in context with India’s power generation mix.In 2024, fossil fuels, primarily coal, still contributed 78% of India’s electricity. Every watt wasted at home directly translates into:When phantom loads, old appliances, and wiring losses across millions of households are added together, they contribute millions of tonnes of avoidable CO₂ emissions every year. Energy wastage isn’t just a household problem, it's a climate problem.A quick survey conducted among a small group of people revealed a pattern that most people were willing to adopt cost-effective energy measures and cared about the environmental impact of hidden energy drains, which highlights that most energy waste isn’t because people don’t care. It’s mostly because:But it does, especially when multiplied by India’s millions of households..Another reason revealed was lack of awareness. Many people didn’t even know that standby consumption exists and what actually is the star rating that we see on appliances.Ishita Mahapatra, 23, said “Honestly, I never checked star ratings before buying any appliance. I was curious about what they meant, but I assumed it was just some pricing gimmick. I usually focus more on features and how the product looks, and wasn't aware or particularly concerned about how much electricity it might consume or waste while buying”.The State Energy Efficiency Index 2024 shows that the domestic sector accounts for nearly one-third of India’s electricity consumption, highlighting how crucial household actions are.Even those aware often don’t have the time or motivation to unplug devices, maintain appliances, or check wiring.Many households opt for cheaper, old-tech or low-star appliances because they cannot afford more efficient models. Ironically, this results in higher electricity bills, a long-term penalty for a short-term saving.On being asked why he thinks energy wastage continues to happen in his home, Shivendra Singh, 26, said, “We’ve all heard and seen energy-saving campaigns, but I think the problem is that we’ve never really experienced electricity scarcity firsthand.”“There’s no visible consequence when we waste power. So we underestimate the harm. Because the impact isn’t immediate or personal, it’s easy to ignore it in daily life”, he added.Somesh Kumar, Partner and Leader, Power & Utilities, EY India explained how Urban households waste more energy overall because of higher appliance density — ACs, large fridges, multiple TVs, routers, smart devices. Cooling inefficiencies and standby loads dominate their silent losses.Rural homes, though consuming less power, surprisingly waste more per device due to:“With 86% of rural households historically dependent on biomass, electrification is growing rapidly. If rural India adopts low-efficiency appliances now, these could remain in use for 10–15 years, locking in long-term inefficiency. Cities waste more because they use more. Villages risk wasting more because their choices today shape consumption for a decade” said Somesh Kumar.Your smartphone scrolling, cloud backup, digital payments, streaming all depend on massive data centres. These energy-intensive facilities require extensive cooling, magnifying their consumption. If the digital economy grows faster than renewable energy integration, India's coal dependency will deepen. Digital convenience, too, comes with a rising environmental price.Satnam Singh, Senior Practice Leader & Director at Crisil Intelligence, underscores the scale of household inefficiency at a time when India’s energy demand is soaring and the country is trying to shift to cleaner, more efficient systems. He explains that despite advances in technology and policy, the biggest energy losses often occur inside our own homes—long before electricity is put to any productive use.“As India pushes toward cleaner energy and smarter consumption, a surprising amount of electricity is still being lost inside our own homes—long before it reaches any productive use. Old refrigerators, air conditioners, fans and TVs consume far more power than modern models… often using 40–60% more electricity.Many devices never fully switch off… This standby load can account for up to 10% of a household’s consumption. Every unit wasted at home means more fuel burned for power generation… Cutting this invisible consumption is one of the fastest, lowest-cost ways to reduce emissions. This Energy Conservation Day, remember: the cleanest energy is the energy we never waste.”Even the smallest habits like leaving a charger plugged in, a microwave display glowing, a router humming nonstopextract costs from both the environment and the household wallet.Many of these steps cost nothing but save 5–12% on bills.India’s energy efficiency performance varies significantly across states, according to the State Energy Efficiency Index (SEEI) 2024 released by the Bureau of Energy Efficiency (BEE) in association with the Alliance for an Energy Efficient Economy. The index evaluates 36 states and union territories across seven sectors including buildings, industry, transport, agriculture, municipal services and DISCOMs using 66 indicators to assess how effectively regions are implementing energy‑saving measures. In the latest rankings, Maharashtra topped the list overall , followed closely by Andhra Pradesh , while Assam and Tripura led in their respective energy‑use groups based on total consumption. Five states Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Telangana and Tamil Nadu were classified as “front runners” for scoring above 60% on the index. States such as Assam and Kerala made it into the “achiever” category, showing solid implementation, while several others including Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Odisha and Uttar Pradesh were placed in the “contender” group, highlighting room for stronger action. These varied performances reflect not just differing consumption patterns but also how state‑level policies and on‑ground execution shape energy efficiency outcomes.Just like we cut a cake to celebrate joy, perhaps we can celebrate Energy Conservation Day every day by cutting down energy wastage. Small, mindful acts — unplugging a charger, turning off a router at night, closing a fridge door promptly, can collectively move India towards a greener, more efficient future.Energy conservation isn’t just a national mission. It’s a household habit that can significantly contribute to India’s energy conservation goals for the years to come.The story of energy waste is invisible, but the solutions are tangible, low-cost, and achievable. All it takes is awareness, a shift in habits, and a little daily mindfulness.","Every month, millions of indian households pay for electricity they never actually use.

"Trai rejects DoT’s proposal to keep BSNL’s satellite spectrum charges at 1 percent, calls it ‘discriminatory’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/trai-rejects-dots-proposal-to-keep-bsnls-satellite-spectrum-charges-at-1-percent-calls-it-discriminatory/articleshow/125963030.cms,"NEW DELHI: The standoff between the department of telecom (DoT) and regulator Trai regarding recommendations for satellite spectrum is intensifying, with the latter now raising objections to lower charges being sought for state-owned BSNL’s services.As differences between the two critical organisations come out openly over satellite spectrum charges and other areas such as subsidies, the preferential treatment accorded to BSNL has now been flagged off as “discriminatory” by Trai which has refused to agree with DoT’s views on the subject.In its recommendations given to DoT earlier this year, Trai had recommended that spectrum charges for GSO (Geostationary Orbit) and NGSO (Non-Geostationary Orbit)-based Mobile Satellite Services should be levied at 4% of Adjusted Gross Revenue (AGR). However, in its assessment of the recommendations, DoT asked Trai to have a re-look, saying that spectrum charges for BSNL may continue to be levied at 1% of AGR as it is “mainly providing services for strategic purposes. ”Trai has now refused to accept this suggestion and has rather said that it will be discriminatory for other new entrants to the satellite sector who may also provide services similar to what BSNL is providing today.“… the Authority does not agree with the DoT’s view that for Global Satellite Phone Service or GSPS license of BSNL, spectrum charges may continue to be levied at 1% of AGR,” the regulator said, a view that is not being seen favourably by top officials at DoT.Trai said it will be “unfair and unreasonable” to seek 1% AGR charge for BSNL just on the premise that it is providing services for strategic purposes. “DoT’s proposal provides for lesser spectrum charges to a specific service provider i.e. BSNL, a PSU which would be discriminatory in the scenario of multiple service providers for MSS (Mobile Satellite Service).”It also raised objections to the grounds of “strategic purposes” being ascribed just to BSNL. It said that other telecom service providers may also provide services for strategic use, besides commercial use. “However, presently there is no scheme for differential charging of lesser spectrum charges across services and across service providers for providing services for strategic purposes. On this count also such a preferential treatment would be discriminatory. ”Trai said that the 1% spectrum charge for BSNL’s satellite services had been recommended in December 2018 under ‘sui-generis’ category as there was only one single operator then. “Global Satellite Phone Service was majorly being used by the govt agencies and that was the only way to avail telecom connectivity in far-flung areas and water bodies. At that time, this service was not considered as a premium service but was akin to emergency services. ”However, in May 2022, DoT had given orders to expand the scope of the ‘sui-generis’ license granted to BSNL for satellite-based services to provide satellite-based data connectivity to IoT devices/ aggregator devices.Trai says that the industry’s dynamics have changed since. “… significant developments have taken place in the Indian telecom landscape, evolving satellite service technologies and changing market dynamics.”It said that in its reference on satellite communication of July 2024, DoT had itself asked Trai to account for “level playing field” with terrestrial access services for GSO/ NGSO-based Mobile Satellite Services (MSS) providing voice, text, data, and internet services (besides NGSO based Fixed Satellite Services).",The standoff between the department of telecom (dot) and regulator trai regarding recommendations for satellite spectrum is intensifying.

How Triple H and Stephanie McMahon accumulated long-term financial strength through wrestling, leadership and corporate expansion

Why their legacy still guides WWE’s future identity

As members of the WWE corporate leadership team and creative team members, Triple H and Stephanie McMahon are important to both the WWE corporate and creative ecosystems. The estimated net worth of Triple H is approximately $250 million, while the estimated net worth of Stephanie McMahon is approximately $250 million.Therefore, the combined estimated value of both Triple H and Stephanie McMahon in 2025 will be approximately $500 million based on the long-term growth of their respective equity interests, as well as the decades they have each spent with WWE.Triple H’s career rarely moved in a straight line, because his shift from performer to executive created a layered income structure through royalties, contract earnings and high-ranking corporate roles. His long involvement in creative planning continues to generate value as global media rights expand and the talent pipelines he built remain central to WWE’s structure.Stephanie McMahon followed a different path, leading branding initiatives that led to other sources of income, community programmes and global partnerships while earning multi-million-dollar compensation packages across several executive cycles.WWE's merger with Endeavor has provided additional value for its shareholdings as a result of increased activity in the marketplace and the evolution of entertainment entities to include more entertainment-based revenue streams.Due to this growth, WWE and Endeavor's financial momentum have developed over time as a result of the company being able to create global brands and have a consistent presence in the evolution of WWE from within its Entertainment Model.Through WWE Television and Digital showcases, Triple H's fingerprints remain very evident. Many of the strategies that he created while heading up NXT are still being utilized in the creation of talent presentation, match structure, and long-term development of characters for the roster of talent on the main roster.The vision of talent recruitment created by Stephanie McMahon will shape the future stories of multiple main event talents, providing WWE with a solid foundation for character development and storytelling. The previous work of Stephanie McMahon will continue to strengthen WWE's public image and brand as a result of the partnerships, digital initiatives and outreach programs she helped create before transitioning out of day-to-day responsibilities.The combination of Triple H and Stephanie McMahon is now being viewed as a creative foundation and business guideline for the future growth of WWE under TKO and the ongoing economic security that both Stephanie McMahon and Triple H represent.Also Read: WWE in big trouble?

Before anyone could even ask for proof, the rumor had already started trending across timelines. And the funniest part? There is still no verified evidence that any of this actually happened.The entire story started from a single viral tweet claiming Megan cheated and Klay ended things. That’s it. No reporting from credible outlets. No insiders confirming anything. No statements from either side. Just one post with no receipts attached. And yet, within minutes, fans across X were reacting like the breakup was a certified fact.This is the classic social media cycle, one bold claim, zero verification, and a whole lot of people filling in the blanks with vibes, jokes, and emotional damage.A lot of users saw the tweet and instantly asked the most obvious question, “Where is the proof?”One user wrote:echoing the disbelief many felt. Another user, @fuckrvt, added,which might be the only reasonable stance on breakup rumors these days.One user claimed,a line that instantly turned into a mini-meme on the thread. Others weren’t shocked at all, with another user saying,and another adding,A surprising number of users blamed Megan without any evidence. One person wrote,Another said:even though nothing has been proven.Right now, the alleged breakup between Megan Thee Stallion and Klay Thompson is nothing more than a viral claim. No proof. No confirmation. No real sources.Until verified outlets report it or one of them speaks up this entire rumor is just Twitter doing what Twitter does: talking loud, fast, and without waiting for facts.Also read - “Kobe Bryant wasn’t a good person”: Alleged childhood friend says Lakers legend wasn’t generous to family or friends","Internet erupts after viral post claims megan thee stallion cheated on klay thompson.

TCS Layoffs: Maharashtra labour minister Aakash Fundkar gives written reply in Vidhan Parishad on TCS layoffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/maharashtra-labour-minister-aakash-fundkar-gives-written-reply-in-vidhan-parishad-on-tcs-layoffs/articleshow/125886840.cms,"TCS layoffs: Legislative concerns

TCS HR chief Sudeep Kunnumal on layoffs in future





Maharashtra labour minister Aakash Fundkar has now informed that the state legislative council that around 376 employees of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) were laid off at the company’s Pune campuses over the past two quarters of the current fiscal year. The disclosure was made via a hand written reply during the Vidhan Parishad session, after concerns were raised by members over reports of widespread layoffs in the IT sector.Fundkar further clarified that the layoffs were not linked to artificial intelligence or automation, addressing speculation that job losses were part of a broader restructuring driven by new technologies. In the Vidhan Parishad, Fundkar revealed that the company fired 376 employees from its Pune campus and the round of layoffs mainly impacted middle and senior-level managers.As reported by new agency PTI, during the Question Hour, the legislators including Uma Khare and Prasad Lad raised questions about increasing job losses in the technology sector and the impact of AI adoption on employment. The reply by the minister is sought to provide transparency by citing official data received directly from TCS.The Maharashtra government also stressed in the fact that while the layoffs have occurred, they are not on the scale suggested by media reports of mass layoffs across multiple cities.The minister further assured the council that the government is monitoring developments in the IT sector closely, given its importance to employment and state’s economy.Recently, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) HR head Sudeep Kunnumal recently addressed concerns over potential layoffs at the IT giant. Speaking during the company’s Q2 earnings call earlier this month, Kunnumal said that TCS is not “chasing a target” when it comes to job cuts. Instead, the IT firm said it will evaluate “everyone”.During the earnings call, analyst Surendra Goyal from Citi asked: “The (second) question is with the release of 1% workforce, the headcount declined by 20,000 people or 3%. And what you had announced earlier was 2%. So should we expect a similar kind of head count reduction in the next quarter as well?”TCS HR head Sudeep Kunnumal replied to the question saying: “So almost -- see, the 20,000 head count is a factor of voluntary and involuntary attrition. So you should see that. But as we announced, against the 2 percentage, we have midway, so we have done approximately 1 percentage of it. And like what Krithi just mentioned, we don't have a target.”",Around 376 employees of tata consultancy services (tcs) were laid off at the company’s pune campuses over the past two quarters of the current fiscal year.

Beats Powerbeats Fit review: The fit is right,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/reviews/beats-powerbeats-fit-review-the-fit-is-right/articleshow/125962311.cms,"The Beats Powerbeats Fit are 2021's Fit Pro with softer, more comfortable wingtips and a smaller case. They fix the original's pressure point issues and stay secure during workouts, but use four-year-old hardware at Rs 24,900. Sound quality and features are adequate but dated compared to similarly-priced alternatives. They're worth considering if you prioritize fit and comfort during workouts over acoustics.

The fit that finally works

Punchy when you need it

The basics, done well

The value question

Our rating: 3.5/5





There's a specific kind of forgetting that happens with good workout gear. You stop noticing your shoes exist. Your shirt quits announcing its presence. Your earbuds just stay put and let you focus on other things. The Beats Powerbeats Fit gave me that experience around kilometre five of a Sunday run, which was unexpected. Not because they did anything revolutionary, but because they simply stopped being an issue.These are the 2021 Beats Fit Pro with softer wingtips and a smaller case. That's the update. No new chip, no dramatic feature additions, no reason they should feel meaningfully different from their predecessor. But after three weeks of using them across runs, gym sessions, and long workdays, I kept reaching for them first. At Rs 24,900, that preference needs explaining.The changes here are subtle enough that you might miss them in photos. The wingtips look similar to the Fit Pro's, just slightly shorter and more rounded. But pick them up and the difference is immediate—they bend and flex with almost no resistance, especially where they meet the earbud body. Beats claims they're 20% more flexible. I can't verify that number, but I can tell you they feel noticeably more forgiving.I put them through the usual gauntlet: morning runs, some half-willed gym sessions heavy on running (again), a brutal badminton matches that had me questioning my life choices. The Powerbeats Fit stayed locked in throughout, tucked into that little ridge in your upper ear without creating the pressure points that plagued the older model. By hour three of wearing them during a long workday, there was no discomfort. That's new.Beats includes four ear tip sizes now instead of three, adding an XS option. The fit test feature in iOS settings is worth using—it revealed I needed larger tips than I normally use, which improved both comfort and sound quality. Once you find the right combination of tips and positioning, these become the kind of earbuds you forget you're wearing, which is exactly what workout gear should do.The case got smaller—for the numbers people, 17% that’s what Beats say, though I didn't measure. What matters is it actually fits in a pocket now without looking like you're smuggling contraband. The lid closes with a satisfying snap instead of the loose wiggle the old case had. Both buds and case carry IPX4 water resistance, so rain and sweat won't be issues.What's missing is wireless charging. The Powerbeats Pro 2 have it, the AirPods Pro have it. For the price PowerBeats Fit is asking, I expect it.These use the same acoustic setup as the 2021 Fit Pro, which means they sound like first-generation AirPods Pro with a bit more emphasis on bass. Not the old Beats bass that rattled your skull, but a fuller low-end that makes workouts more enjoyable without turning every song into a muddy mess.Playing D'Angelo's ""Really Love,"" that opening bass line hits with weight while the strings and vocals maintain clarity. Switch to something like Jai Paul's ""Jasmine"" and the production's layers stay distinct—synths don't blur together, drums punch through. The Adaptive EQ adjusts sound based on how the buds fit in your ears, and when properly sealed, the tuning works well for most music.The spatial audio with head tracking adds some dimensionality when watching movies or shows. Watching The Substance, the atmospheric sound design had more presence with spatial audio enabled, though it's not as convincing as what you get with H2-equipped products. During Shogun episodes, dialogue stayed centred while ambient sounds—wind, rustling leaves, distant conversations—filled the space around it. It's a noticeable improvement over standard stereo, but not dramatically so.Here's where the age shows: these are working with 2021 hardware in 2025. The upper frequencies lose some definition—cymbals sound less shimmery, hi-hats feel slightly muted. Compare them directly to the AirPods Pro 2 and you'll hear cleaner highs and better overall balance.But context matters here. During a run or workout, when you're focused on movement rather than dissecting production choices, these sound engaging and energetic. It's only when you sit down for deliberate listening, or start A/B testing, that the age of the hardware starts showing.The H1 chip handles Apple ecosystem basics smoothly. Pairing with an iPhone is instant. Automatic device switching works reliably, though there's occasionally a brief lag. Hands-free Siri responds without delay. Find My tracking lets you locate them through the app.Android users get similar functionality through the Beats app—one-touch pairing, control customization, fit test, and location tracking. It works better than most third-party earbuds on Android, though not as seamlessly as with an iPhone.What's missing are the features enabled by Apple's H2 chip. No Adaptive Audio that adjusts between noise cancellation and transparency based on your environment. No Conversation Awareness that lowers volume when you start talking. No hearing health features. These aren't just spec-sheet additions—they genuinely improve daily use on products that have them.The active noise cancellation is decent. On a train, it reduces engine rumble and lowers conversations to background noise. In a gym, it cuts ambient music enough that your own playlist stays clear. It's effective without being exceptional.Transparency mode works adequately. Voices sound relatively natural rather than processed. I could have brief conversations without removing the earbuds, though people occasionally asked me to speak up. It's functional without being impressive.Call quality is acceptable. On quiet calls, I sounded clear. Add background noise—traffic, café chatter—and people heard more of it than ideal. The dual beamforming mics focus on your voice, but the processing doesn't eliminate surrounding noise aggressively. Fine for personal calls, less ideal for important meetings in noisy environments.Beats claims seven hours per charge with ANC off, six hours with it on, plus 24 more hours from the case. These numbers hold up in regular use. An hour-long workout with noise cancellation on drained about 15% battery. After a week of daily running sessions without charging the case, it still had roughly 30% left.Fast Fuel quick-charging works as advertised—five minutes in the case provides about an hour of playback. A full case charge via USB-C takes around 90 minutes.Battery life isn't something you'll think about with these. Use them daily and you'll charge the case maybe once a week.The Powerbeats Fit do what they're meant to do—they're comfortable, secure during workouts, and deliver sound quality that works well for active use. Those redesigned wingtips genuinely solve the comfort issues that plagued the original. The pricing is where things get complicated. At Rs 24,900, they're competing directly with the AirPods Pro 3, which offer more advanced features and better overall sound for the same price. The AirPods Pro 2, which often sell for less, bring superior noise cancellation and a more polished experience. Within Beats' own lineup, the Powerbeats Pro 2 offer the newer H2 chip and heart-rate tracking for a bit more.But here's the case for them: if you've struggled with earbuds falling out or becoming uncomfortable during workouts, the wingtip design here might be worth the compromise elsewhere. The fit and stability are genuinely better than most alternatives, and for some people, that matters more than having the latest chip or most advanced features. Yes, the Pro 2s have better sound and features, but at Rs 5,000 less, the Fit make sense if budget matters and you prefer the more compact, discreet wingtip design over bulkier ear hooks.So, if comfort during movement is your priority—if you've returned earbuds before because they hurt after an hour or wouldn't stay put during runs—the Fits solve that specific problem well. Just know what you're getting: a genuinely improved fit on hardware that's showing its age elsewhere.","Beats powerbeats fit are 2021's fit pro with softer, more comfortable wingtips and a smaller case.

From being kicked out to hosting the Octagon spotlight: How viral streamer N3on pulled off his most unexpected UFC comeback,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/from-being-kicked-out-to-hosting-the-octagon-spotlight-how-viral-streamer-n3on-pulled-off-his-most-unexpected-ufc-comeback/articleshow/125968507.cms,"Once a controversial figure, N3on has made a remarkable comeback in the UFC world. He transitioned from being escorted out of events to hosting a highly successful Web3 digital collectibles drop during UFC 323 weekend. This event, featuring top fighters, generated millions, showcasing N3on's new role as a digital host and proving his evolving influence in traditional sports.

How N3on went from UFC exile to a central figure in a multimillion-dollar digital drop





Just a few years ago, N3on’s name was synonymous with chaos rather than credibility in the UFC world. The livestreamer was escorted out of a major fight event, publicly dismissed by Dana White, and widely labeled a clout-chaser after talking on stream about confronting Donald Trump at UFC 296.For many fans, that moment felt like the end of N3on’s brief flirtation with combat sports. Instead, it became the setup for a surprising reinvention. In 2025, the 21-year-old resurfaced during UFC 323 weekend, not as a fan or fighter, but as a digital host directly tied to the Octagon itself, proving that internet influence can still find new doors into traditional sports.N3on’s return came through an unexpected lane: Web3-style collectibles. On December 7, he hosted Telegram’s UFC Strike Gift Drop, a live digital auction synchronized with UFC 323. Rather than chasing attention from the crowd, he streamed alongside the release of limited UFC-themed digital gifts, instantly drawing massive online engagement.“I’ve streamed with a bunch of people,” N3on told TMZ Sports ahead of the event, “but these are real, real stars. All the biggest fighters are coming together for this.”The roster backed up that confidence. Fighters like Jon Jones, Alex Pereira, Israel Adesanya, Charles Oliveira, Sean O’Malley, Ilia Topuria, Khamzat Chimaev, and Alexander Volkanovski were all part of the drop.Fans bid using Telegram’s Stars currency on mystery boxes tied to 10 fighters, with standard and Golden-tier options that could be upgraded within the app. The four-hour auction sold out completely, with all 60,000 gifts claimed and millions generated in Stars, marking one of the most successful UFC-linked digital activations to date.Despite his proximity to elite fighters, N3on has made it clear he won’t be fighting anytime soon. “There was a point in my life where I was like, ‘Yeah, bro, I wanna do this, I’m gonna beat anyone that comes my way,’” he previously told TMZ, adding, “But I just don’t think it’s in me.”Still, he hasn’t avoided physical reality checks. Earlier this year, UFC prospect Raul Rosas Jr. put him through a brutal gym session that left no illusions intact. Outside MMA, N3on continues to expand, landing a record deal with EMPIRE, collaborating with major rappers, and entering business ventures like Iggy Azalea’s MOTHERLAND casino.Once written off, N3on’s UFC reentry shows how digital relevance, when redirected, can reshape a public narrative, without ever throwing a punch.Also Read: RaKai fires back at Ironmouse after she says Streamer Awards interaction made her feel uncomfortable","N3on has made a remarkable comeback in the ufc world.

UAE poised to make lunar history with Rashid Rover 2 mission to Moon’s far side,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-poised-to-make-lunar-history-with-rashid-rover-2-mission-to-moons-far-side/articleshow/125926325.cms,"The UAE’s Rashid Rover 2, launching in 2026, will explore the Moon’s far side/Image: X

Rover ready for launch

Far side exploration



Learning from the first attempt



Arab space milestones



Looking ahead







The UAE is moving forward for its historic moment of space exploration. Rashid Rover 2, the country’s second lunar rover, has passed an important round of tests in the US. These checks mean it’s now one step closer to heading to the Moon’s far side in 2026, riding aboard Firefly Aerospace’s Blue Ghost Mission 2 lander.Before leaving the UAE, Rashid Rover 2 went through thorough environmental and functional checks. In the US, engineers worked with Firefly Aerospace to see how it interacts with the lander. They tested the rover’s electrical systems, software, and mechanical parts. Wireless communication between the rover and lander was also checked. Finally, they ran deployment and drive off simulations to make sure the rover can safely move around once it reaches the Moon.Salem Al Marri, head of the Mohammed bin Rashid Space Centre, said all tests were successful and confirmed the rover is ready. Dr Hamad AlMarzooqi, project manager for the mission, highlighted that the work with Firefly is focused on precision and reliability, reflecting the UAE’s larger goals in space exploration.Rashid Rover 2 will explore the Moon’s far side, the part that never faces Earth. The terrain there is rough and the crust is thicker than on the near side.The rover is equipped with cameras and scientific tools to study the Moon’s surface temperature, soil, plasma environment, and photoelectron sheath.This data will help plan future lunar missions and could guide the use of lunar resources.The mission is also international. The rover will carry instruments from Australia, NASA, and the European Space Agency. Farah Zuberi from Firefly Aerospace said the successful testing brings the mission closer to deployment and will provide new insights into this mysterious region of the Moon.Rashid Rover 2 is the UAE’s second attempt at a lunar landing. The first, Rashid Rover 1, launched in December 2022, was lost in April 2023 when the Japanese lander it was riding, Hakuto R Mission 1, crashed. This second attempt builds on those lessons and aims to succeed where the first one failed.The UAE’s lunar mission is happening alongside another milestone. The first joint Arab satellite, 813, launched from China this week. The 260 kilogram satellite is for Earth observation and was developed by engineers from the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Jordan, Bahrain, Sudan, Kuwait, Oman, and Lebanon.The satellite’s name refers to 813 AD, when Baghdad’s House of Wisdom became a public academy. Salem Al Qubaisi, director general of the UAE Space Agency, said the project helps build research capabilities, train Arab talent in space science, and provide climate data for countries in the region.Rashid Rover 2 is scheduled to launch in early 2026 for a 10 day mission on the Moon’s far side. If all goes well, the UAE will become only the second nation to land there successfully. The rover’s work will provide valuable data for future missions and underline the UAE’s growing role in global space research.","Rashid rover 2 is scheduled to launch in early 2026 for a 10 day mission on the moon’s far side.

'Don't delete social media apps from phone': Immigration attorney on US border checking,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/dont-delete-social-media-apps-from-phone-immigration-attorney-on-us-border-checking/articleshow/125966088.cms,"



Checking social media before allowing entry into the country is not a new practice for the US but the new regulations only ensure that there will strict enforcement, Canada-based immigration attorney Benjamin Green said as Canadians, who don't require a visa to enter the US, will also come under some kind of social media checking. According to a proposed rule, the US administration will check social media details, old phone numbers, unused email addresses of all those who travel to the US -- even from countries which are on visa waiver.Canada is ona visa waiver but social media checking at US border is nothing new, Green said, adding that people should not delete all social media apps from their phones, as that would instantly raise suspicion. Those who require visa will have to provide their details during the visa process but for Canadians, the check may happen in person when a border official asks for the phone of a person entering from Canada to the US.Green told CTV that if a border agent finds out that a person's phone has no social media app or the person is traveling with a burner phone, this is an immediate red flag. “If I’m an officer and I see somebody has a wiped phone or a phone without social media or without any personal emails, that doesn’t scream to me, ‘Wow this is somebody who has nothing to hide.’This screams to me that it’s somebody with something to hide.”Green said Canadians should not face any problem if they are stopped at the border and their phones are checked. “This type of a search only happens in a larger, cascading series of events. On a given entry, you’ve said something that makes an officer question some things and on and on until they’re pulling you into secondary (screening) and looking at your phone,” he said. “But the average person, as long as it’s calm, cool and collected, it’s largely business as usual. ”Green said Canafdian travelers have the right to refuse to show border officers their phones or laptops but then the border officer also has the right to deny the entry.","Us to check social media details, old phone numbers, unused email addresses of all those who travel to the us -- even from countries on visa waiver.

LONDON:





Sophie Kinsella, the author of “Confessions of a Shopaholic” and a series of millions-selling rom-com sequels, died Monday, her family said. She was 55 and had been diagnosed with brain cancer. The family posted on Kinsella’s Instagram account: “We are heartbroken to announce the passing this morning of our beloved Sophie (aka Maddy, aka Mummy). She died peacefully, with her final days filled with her true loves: family and music and warmth and Christmas and joy. “We can’t imagine what life will be like without her radiance and love of life.”Kinsella, who also published under her real name, Madeleine Wickham, announced in April 2024 that she had been diagnosed in late 2022 with glioblastoma, an aggressive form of brain cancer. “I did not share this before because I wanted to make sure that my children were able to hear and process the news in privacy and adapt to our ’new normal,’” she said at the time.Starting in 2000 with “The Secret Dreamworld of a Shopaholic”, titled “Confessions of a Shopaholic” in the US, Kinsella published 10 “Shopaholic” novels, along with other fiction. Her books have sold more than 45 million copies worldwide and have been translated into dozens of languages.The first two “Shopaholic” books were adapted into the 2009 film “Confessions of a Shopaholic”, starring Isla Fisher and Hugh Dancy. Kinsella did not grow up intending to be a writer. One of three girls born to teachers in London, she played piano and violin as a child and also composed music. She told authorpublisher Zibby Owens on her podcastthat the idea of writing never crossed her mind.Kinsella enrolled at Oxford University to study music but switched to the politics, philosophy and economics program after one year. While at college, she fell in love with musician Henry Wickham. The couple had four sons and a daughter.After graduating, Kinsella began working as a financial journalist and spent her commute reading. The idea to write fiction herself began to take shape on the train. She published her debut novel, “The Tennis Party”, in 1995 when she was 24, as Madeleine Wickham. Soon after, she left her journalism job to focus on writing. Six other books, including “The Gatecrasher” and “Sleeping Arrangements”, followed.An otherwise normal shopping excursion sparked the idea for writing her first “Shopaholic” novel. “I remember looking around me and thinking... “We all shop... We talk about it. We do it. We rejoice in it. We make bad decisions.

"Watch: Black bear attacks keeper during stage show at Hangzhou Safari Park, viral video triggers safety debate",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/watch-black-bear-attacks-keeper-during-stage-show-at-hangzhou-safari-park-viral-video-triggers-safety-debate/articleshow/125827140.cms,"



A pleasant and peaceful performance at Hangzhou Safari Park in East China’s Zhejiang Province on Saturday turned terrifying when a black bear suddenly attacked its keeper.Several videos are going viral on social media, showing audience members watching as two keepers guided two black bears onto the stage for another round of performance. One bear successfully performed, while the other, nearing the stage, pounced on its keeper and knocked him to the ground, Global News reported.The fallen keeper struggled to escape while nearby staff grabbed chairs and poles to separate the animal. After the bear was pulled away, it lunged at the keeper again, and staff had to use force to separate them.This footage prompted an online debate over whether animal performances should be banned. Other staff immediately intervened and used props to separate the bear from the keeper. Multiple social media users posted videos of the incident recorded during the bears’ show.The park explained that the incident occurred as the keeper was carrying a large bag of carrots and apples; the bear saw the bag, became excited, and pounced on the keeper in an attempt to get the food, according to the notice. The notice also stated that the keeper said the incident reminded him to be more careful in dealings with the bear in the future.The official social media account of Hangzhou Safari Park posted a notice on Saturday stating that neither the keeper nor the bear was injured.One user, Momo, on the China's social media platform commented, “Safety must be a priority, and we should have respect for animals. Never think of them as cute and docile, or that we can control them.”Another user, Zero Geqian Qianqian, also emphasised the need to focus on safety. Many others have called for the cancellation of animal performances. A user named “Don’t Call Me Ma Ma Ma” asked, “When will animal performances be canceled? Isn’t it in animals’ nature to be food-driven and protective of their food?”Some users expressed sympathy for the bear. A user named “The Girl is Out, I’m at Home” said, “A small bear is like a little baby. How could we make it perform? If it has apples, let it eat! If it were your child, would you make it perform first and then eat? If it’s hungry, then let it perform how to eat, it would be happier, the keeper and the bear would be more harmonious, and the audience would still enjoy it.”On the X also, several users commented on the video. One of the user said, ""I see why the Russians train with them 🤣🤣🤣 that bear is a professional grappler.""Another said, ""Maybe if we didn't lock these animals up for our own amusement they wouldn't attack people.""After the video of the bear attack went viral online and sparked debate, the park released a follow-up video showing that the bear and the keeper have since “reconciled.” While feeding the black bear carrots, the keeper gently petted its head and said, “If you want carrots, why did you snatch mine? [Even if you didn’t], I’ll still give you some.” The black bear stood calmly and ate peacefully, displaying a gentle demeanour.",A black bear suddenly attacked its keeper at hangzhou safari park in china.
