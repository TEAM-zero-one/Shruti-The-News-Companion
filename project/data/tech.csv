US pharma tariffs to have limited impact in India: Govt to panel,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/us-pharma-tariffs-to-have-limited-impact-in-india-govt-to-panel/articleshow/124220399.cms,"Representative image

Amid Trump Tariffs, EAM Jaishankar Warns Of ‘Tariff Volatility, Market Uncertainty’ In UNGA

NEW DELHI: The Union commerce ministry told a key parliamentary panel Monday that US tariffs on India’s pharma exports will have a limited impact because India largely exports “generic drugs” instead of “patented drugs” that will bear the brunt of the US decision.At a meeting of the Public Accounts Committee, a top commerce ministry official, who has been engaged with the US on trade deal negotiations, is learnt to have said that fresh US pharma tariffs are applicable to all exporters worldwide with the exception of the European Union (EU), and India’s principal rival China is also subject to the same tariff regime.“It neutralises any relative disadvantage for India,” he reportedly said.Though the agenda for the meeting was a discussion on the performance audit of “export promotion capital goods”, PAC chairman KC Venugopal and some MPs like Jagdambika Pal are said to have asked the official several questions on the US tariffs and the future scenario.The official said that while engaging with the US to work out a balanced bilateral trade agreement, India has the objective of buffering domestic sectors like agriculture and sensitive industries, and expanding exports.He highlighted that continued high tariffs are bad for the economy as they erode competitiveness and bring down export growth.Marine exports like fish face a challenging scenario as they are burdened with 50% tariffs in the United States, placing India at a relative disadvantage when compared with competitors like Ecuador, which face lower tariffs. Indian exporters will thus lose ground in the absence of a bilateral trade deal prescribing lower tariffs, he added.Stating that India is also seeking to diversify its export markets to reduce dependence on the US, he listed the FTAs signed recently, like with the European Free Trade Association, comprising Switzerland, Iceland, Norway and Liechtenstein — which will help marine exports on account of low tariffs.He said that the FTA with the UK will be activated next year, removing 8-12% duty on marine exports to the UK.",The union commerce ministry told a key parliamentary panel monday that us tariffs on india’s pharma exports will have a limited impact.

Charlie Kirk questioned Taylor Swift’s political post and dismissed her knowledge

Years later, Charlie Kirk turned his criticism on Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s relationship

Back in 2018, Charlie Kirk — the outspoken founder of Turning Point USA — used his national platform to lash out at Taylor Swift after the pop star broke her silence on politics. Years later, his assassination in 2025 has reframed those moments as part of his long history of targeting cultural icons like Swift and, more recently, her fiancé Travis Kelce Taylor Swift shocked fans in October 2018 when she endorsed Democrat Phil Bredesen for Senate in Tennessee and spoke out against Republican candidate Marsha Blackburn, saying her record “appalls and terrifies me.” She urged fans to register to vote and added, “I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country.”Kirk, then just 24, appeared on Fox and Friends to undermine Swift’s words. “I don’t want to accuse her of this, but I don’t think she’s the only one who wrote that post on Instagram. She probably got some very bad information,” he said, suggesting she wasn’t capable of forming her own opinions. He also accused her of turning away from her brand, saying, “This is what I used to love about Taylor Swift is she stayed away from politics — she was all about music, all about female empowerment. ”On Twitter, Kirk went further, writing, “You have absolutely no idea what you are talking about.Your career has never recovered since Kanye ended it.”That early clash foreshadowed Kirk’s later attacks. In 2025, after Swift’s engagement to Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce, Kirk once again went after her, this time urging her to “submit to your husband Taylor” and mocking her career by saying he couldn’t wait for a “Taylor Kelce concert.” His remarks drew widespread backlash as sexist and bizarre, reinforcing how frequently he used Swift as a cultural punching bag.Also Read: “She ain’t Mother Mary”: Charlie Kirk’s more attacks on Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce resurfaces after his shocking assassination Now, with Charlie Kirk assassinated at a Utah campus event in 2025, those old comments resurface as part of his legacy, one built on provocative culture-war battles. His criticisms of Taylor Swift and even her relationship with Travis Kelce reveal just how much he saw her influence as a political threat. What began in 2018 with a swipe at her Instagram post ended years later as one of the defining feuds of his career and one that continues to echo long after his death.","In 2018, charlie kirk lashed out at taylor swift after she broke her silence on politics.

Optus’ previous failures raise accountability questions





Australia's second-largest telecommunications provider Optus has reported another emergency call outage. This is the second time in 10 days that Optus suffered a major outage. As reported by Reuters, the latest incident occurred on Sunday morning in Dapto, about 100 km south of Sydney, affecting around 4,500 customers. The report also revealed that the Australian government is looking for answers about the disruption.As per the Reuters report, Optus revealed that a faulty mobile tower site interrupted services which included access to emergency numbers. The telecom service providers has confirmed that the issue has been resolved and that “all callers who attempted to contact emergency services are OK.”""Singtel takes this matter seriously and will extend full co-operation to the Australian government and authorities to address the Optus issue,” the spokesperson told Reuters.""Optus continues to investigate the cause ... the issue has been restored,"" a spokesperson said by email.The outage comes during the growing scrutiny of Optus, Australia’s second-largest telecom operator, owned by Singapore Telecommunications (Singtel).Following the earlier 13-hour disruption on September 18, which cut off emergency services in two states and the Northern Territory, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called the failures “completely unacceptable.”Singtel Group CEO Yuen Kuan Moon is scheduled to meet with Australia’s Communications Minister Anika Wells this week, alongside Optus Chairman John Arthur and CEO Stephen Rue, to address the crisis.This marks the second major triple-zero outage for Optus in less than two years.

Israeli military transfers data as Microsoft cuts access





Microsoft has cut off cloud computing and AI services to an Israeli military intelligence unit after an investigation revealed the technology was being used for mass surveillance of Palestinian civilians. The tech giant made the decision following a Guardian investigation that exposed how Israel's Unit 8200 stored millions of intercepted Palestinian phone calls on Microsoft's Azure platform.Brad Smith, Microsoft's president and vice chair, announced the termination in an internal memo to employees, stating the company found ""evidence that supports elements of The Guardian's reporting."" The blocked services include cloud storage and AI technologies that Unit 8200 had used to collect and analyze up to ""a million calls an hour"" from Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.An Israeli security official downplayed the impact, telling CNN there is ""no damage to the operational capabilities of the IDF."" Neither the Israel Defense Forces nor the Ministry of Defense responded to requests for comment about the service termination.The No Azure for Apartheid group, which includes of Microsoft employees, had been pressured Microsoft for over a year through protests and demonstrations, called the decision a significant win.""Today's news is a significant and unprecedented win for the campaign and our organizing,"" said Hossam Nasr, an organizer with the group, noting Microsoft became ""the first US tech company to stop the sale of some technologies to the Israeli military since the start of the genocide in Gaza. ""However, the activist group said the action doesn't go far enough, as Microsoft only disabled services to a single unit while ""the vast majority of Microsoft's contract with the Israeli military remains intact."" The group vowed to continue organizing until all their demands are met.The company said it applies its anti-surveillance principles globally and has maintained this stance for over two decades, with Smith noting that customer privacy commitments prevented Microsoft from accessing the surveillance data directly during its investigation.Intelligence sources told the Guardian that Unit 8200 quickly moved the massive data trove out of Microsoft's Dutch servers within days of the original investigation's publication in August. The unit reportedly plans to transfer the surveillance data to Amazon Web Services, though Amazon has not responded to requests for comment.Smith emphasized that Microsoft ""does not provide technology to facilitate mass surveillance of civilians"" and noted the decision doesn't affect the company's broader relationship with Israel, including cybersecurity work.

Accenture: Building an AI workforce







Accenture has laid off more than 11,000 employees across the globe in the past three months. The company said that it is laying off employees that cannot be trained in AI, as Accenture looks to reshape its workforce for the AI era. The company confirmed that it has fired more than 11,000 employees in the past three months, even as it plans to expand headcount in the coming fiscal year.As reported by Business Insider, during the earnings call Accenture CEO Julie Sweet said that the company has been ""exiting"" employees it can't retrain with artificial intelligence skills, while simultaneously planning to expand head count in the next fiscal year. “We are exiting on a compressed timeline, people where reskilling, based on our experience, is not a viable path for the skills we need,” Accenture CEO told analysts.At the end of August, Accenture’s global headcount stood at 779,000, down from 791,000 three months earlier. The round of layoffs at Accenture began earlier this year and are expected to go on till November 2025. The restructuring at the company majorly covers severance costs and is said to save more than $1 billion for the company.Accenture CFO Angie Park said that the company will also divest two acquisitions as part of what the company calls “rapid talent rotation. ” “These actions will result in cost savings which will be reinvested in our people and our business,” Park said.While trimming roles that don’t align with its future needs, Accenture is said to be aggressively expanding its AI capabilities. The company has revealed that it has doubled down on its AI and data specialists to 77,000 since 2023 and has also trained more than 550,000 employees in generative AI. “Advanced AI is becoming a part of everything we do,” Sweet said, adding that the company views AI not as “deflationary” but “expansionary. ”Despite the layoffs, Accenture reported a 7% year‑on‑year revenue increase to $17.6 billion in the June–August quarter of fiscal 2025, beating estimates. Sweet said the results demonstrate Accenture’s “unique ability to deliver for clients as they seek our help to reinvent and lead with AI.”It is quite clear that Accenture’s restructuring mirrors the trend across companies. Tech giants like Meta, Microsoft and others have also cut down on traditional job roles along with ramping the AI hiring process. For white-collar professionals, the message is clear: adapt to AI or risk obsolescence.","Accenture has laid off more than 11,000 employees across the globe in the past three months.

Trump's $100K H-1B fee creates opportunities, not obstacles for Accenture



Accenture reports strong Q4 results despite immigration policy uncertainty





Accenture CEO Julie Sweet downplayed concerns about the Trump administration's new $100,000 H-1B visa fee, stating the policy change poses minimal threat to the global consulting giant's operations. ""This is really a non-issue because we only have about 5% of our people in the US on H-1B visas, and they're for really specialised experience and skills for our clients,"" Sweet said during the company's earnings call Thursday following its fourth-quarter results announcement.The Dublin-based company's limited reliance on H-1B visas contrasts sharply with many Indian IT firms that depend heavily on the program to staff US projects with skilled workers from abroad. Accenture secured approval for 1,568 H-1B visa beneficiaries in the first half of the year, placing it among the top 25 US employers using the program, according to US immigration data.President Trump's executive order signed September 19 mandates the hefty one-time fee as part of broader immigration reforms, creating uncertainty across the technology sector. The move threatens the traditional cost-saving model many IT service providers rely on.Rather than viewing the policy as problematic, Sweet framed it as a business opportunity. ""Every time there's a big policy change, unfolded over decades, it has usually driven more business for the company,"" she explained, noting Accenture could help clients navigate compliance requirements.The announcement came as Accenture reported strong fourth-quarter results, with revenue of $17.6 billion beating analysts' average estimate of $17.36 billion. The company also unveiled an $865 million restructuring program to realign its workforce for rising demand in digital and AI services.Accenture employs over 770,000 people globally, with more than 350,000 based in India—its largest workforce concentration. The company has steadily reduced H-1B dependency over recent years, with initial approvals dropping from 3,442 in 2015 to just 190 in the first nine months of 2025.","Accenture ceo julie sweet downplayed concerns about the trump administration's new $100,000 h-1b visa fee.

What’s next?







UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Friday unveiled plans to introduce a free digital ID system for all nationals and residents, aiming to curb illegal immigration and simplify access to government services, according to an official statement. .The government said the new digital ID, which will be stored on users’ smartphones, will streamline applications for services such as driving licences, childcare, welfare, and tax records. While individuals will not be required to carry or present the ID routinely, it will be “mandatory as a means of proving your right to work,” the statement added.Starmer explained the move will help prevent those without legal status from securing employment, thereby cutting off a key incentive for illegal migration. “This will stop those with no right to be here from being able to find work, curbing their prospect of earning money, one of the key 'pull factors' for people who come to the UK illegally,” the government said.Here is what you need to know about the government’s digital ID initiative:The new digital ID will be an app or digital credential stored on individuals’ smartphones. It will serve as a secure, government-backed proof of identity to access a range of services - from applying for driving licences and childcare benefits to accessing welfare and tax records.While the ID will not be compulsory to carry or show routinely, it will be mandatory to prove the right to work in the UK. This aims to prevent employers from hiring workers who lack legal permission to work, thereby reducing illegal employment.Starmer described the digital ID as an “enormous opportunity for the UK” and said it will provide “countless benefits” to ordinary citizens while helping the government enforce immigration laws more effectively.The digital ID will be available to all UK nationals and legal residents, including foreign nationals living in the country. The government emphasised inclusivity, pledging that the system will accommodate those without smartphones, such as the elderly or homeless.Details on the application process will be shaped by a forthcoming public consultation planned for later this year. The government has promised to engage with groups who might face challenges using digital services, ensuring the system is user-friendly and accessible to all.The UK has traditionally resisted introducing national ID cards, with the Conservative government scrapping a previous voluntary identity card system in 2011 established under Tony Blair’s administration. However, the current government views digital ID as a modern solution to immigration and public service access challenges.Illegal immigration remains a politically sensitive issue, and Starmer faces pressure from within his own Labour Party to address it effectively ahead of the party’s annual conference.Opposition voices have been critical. Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said on social media that her party would “oppose any push… to impose mandatory ID cards on law-abiding citizens,” stressing that British people should not be forced into such a system.The Liberal Democrats also rejected the plan, arguing they ""cannot support a mandatory digital ID where people are forced to turn over their private data just to go about their daily lives.""Nigel Farage, leader of the hard-right Reform UK party - which polls predict could play a key role in the next government - voiced strong opposition, saying, ""I do not see a single benefit to the government having digital ID other than them controlling what we do, what we spend and where we go.""At present, UK citizens rely on passports, driving licences, and utility bills as forms of identification, depending on the situation. The digital ID aims to unify these disparate proofs into a single, streamlined digital identity.The government will soon launch a public consultation to gather feedback on the digital ID service, including from digitally excluded groups. Officials highlighted that lessons will be drawn from other countries with similar systems to ensure accessibility and privacy protections.(With inputs from agencies)","Uk prime minister keir starmer on friday unveiled plans to introduce a free digital id system for all nationals and residents.

Tips for Saving and Timing Your Gold Purchase





Gold prices in the United Arab Emirates have surged to unprecedented levels, with 22-karat gold reaching AED 422.75 per gram and 24-karat gold climbing to AED 456.75 per gram. This marks a significant increase from the previous all-time highs recorded just last week, reflecting a broader global rally in gold prices.As of Monday morning, the UAE's gold market opened with 22K gold priced at AED 422.75 per gram and 24K gold at AED 456.75 per gram. This represents an AED 3 increase from the record highs set earlier in the week. The surge in prices is attributed to a global uptick in gold values, with spot gold approaching $3,800 per ounce. This trend has been observed across various markets, including India, where 24K gold reached ₹11,547/$124.99 per gram and 22K gold rose to ₹10,585/ $113.52 per gram on the same day.The recent spike in gold prices is largely driven by global economic factors. Investors are flocking to gold as a safe-haven asset amid ongoing geopolitical tensions and economic uncertainties. The demand for gold has been further fueled by a weakening US dollar and concerns over inflation, prompting a surge in gold prices worldwide. These global trends have had a direct impact on the UAE market, pushing local gold prices to new heights.Several key factors are pushing gold prices higher:This combination of global economic trends and domestic demand explains the consecutive record-breaking streak in UAE gold pricesFor consumers in the UAE, the consecutive record-breaking surge in gold prices means jewelry and gold-related purchases are now more expensive, especially with Diwali and other festivals approaching. Traditional buyers should compare making charges across reputable jewelers and consider whether 22K or 24K gold best suits their needs. For investors, the rising prices present opportunities for short-term gains, but careful timing is essential due to daily market fluctuations. Beyond physical gold, alternative options such as gold bars, coins, digital gold platforms, and gold-backed bonds or ETFs are gaining popularity. Digital gold allows you to invest in secure vault-stored gold online with the flexibility to redeem physically later, while bonds and ETFs offer exposure to gold without holding the metal directly. Keeping an eye on both global trends and local demand spikes can help buyers and investors make informed, profitable decisions in this surging market.Trusted Gold Shops in the UAEDigital Gold Investment Platforms in the UAETo get the most value from rising gold prices, timing and strategy are key. Buying slightly before major festivals like Diwali or Eid can help avoid last-minute price spikes caused by high demand. Monitoring daily gold rates and global trends allows buyers to spot dips for better deals. For smaller, regular savings, consider digital gold platforms or gold-backed savings plans, which let you invest gradually without paying full amount upfront. Additionally, fractional gold investments, coins, or small bars can be a cost-effective way to start building a gold portfolio without a large initial outlay. Combining smart timing with flexible investment options helps both consumers and investors maximize returns while minimizing costs.","Uae gold hits all-time highs for consecutive days, driven by investor fears and upcoming festival demand.

Electronic Arts (EA), the creator of globally popular video games including “Madden NFL,” “Battlefield,” and “The Sims,” is poised to exit public markets after agreeing to a $55 billion acquisition. The deal, one of the largest leveraged buyouts ever, will transfer EA into private ownership, giving the company room to restructure without the scrutiny of public investors.The transaction will see private equity firm Silver Lake Partners, Saudi Arabia’s sovereign wealth fund PIF, and Affinity Partners — led by Jared Kushner, President Donald Trump’s son-in-law — pay $210 per share to EA stockholders. This surpasses the $32 billion privatization of Texas utility TXU in 2007, AP reported.EA has been publicly traded for 36 years. Founded by former Apple employee William “Trip” Hawkins, the company went public seven years after its inception, closing its first trading day at a split-adjusted 52 cents per share. CEO Andrew Wilson has led the company since 2013.The buyout is part of a recent flurry of high-profile technology deals involving Silver Lake. The firm is also involved in a joint venture with Oracle to manage US operations of TikTok, though full details of that transaction remain undisclosed.Silver Lake has a history of taking major tech companies private, including Skype in 2009 for $1.9 billion and Dell in 2013 for $24.9 billion, which later returned to public markets in 2018.By going private, EA can reorient its operations without the pressure of meeting quarterly targets. The company’s revenues have remained steady over the past three fiscal years, fluctuating between $7.4 billion and $7.6 billion, even as its games maintain a loyal fan base.Competition in the gaming sector has intensified in recent years. Microsoft acquired rival Activision Blizzard for nearly $69 billion in 2023, and mobile gaming companies like Epic Games have expanded rapidly. Analysts suggest that privatization could allow EA to invest in innovation, streamline operations, and strengthen its market position.While privatizations often lead to layoffs, EA has not indicated any immediate workforce reductions. After trimming 5% of its staff in 2024, the company had 14,500 employees as of March 2025 and carried out further, limited layoffs in May.The acquisition is expected to provide EA the flexibility to restructure, enhance efficiency, and pursue long-term growth strategies without the constraints of public market expectations, potentially reshaping the competitive landscape of the global gaming industry.","Electronic arts will exit public markets after agreeing to a $55 billion acquisition.

MUMBAI: Tata Capital’s Rs 15,511-crore IPO — Tata Group’s biggest-ever and the largest by any NBFC — will be open between Oct 6-8, with anchor bids on Oct 3. Priced at Rs 310–326 a share, the offer values the firm at Rs 1.32–1.38 lakh crore. Investors must bid for at least 46 shares.At the floor, pricing matches Tata Sons ’ rights issue earlier this year — well below the grey-market frenzy that once saw trades over Rs 1,000 before Trump’s tariff tantrums roiled equities.The 47.6-crore-share issue comprises 21 crore fresh shares and a 26.6 crore offer for sale (OFS), leading to 11% dilution. Tata Sons will sell 23 crore shares, IFC 3.6 crore. Proceeds from the fresh issue will bolster Tata Capital’s tier-1 capital; OFS money goes to selling shareholders.“For 18 years, we funded the business with our own capital and were happy with the returns. The IPO is driven by regulatory timelines, though we were glad to support its growth,” said Saurabh Agarwal, group CFO Tata Sons and chairman Tata Capital. On a bank licence, he said: “That question comes up only as and when the corporate houses are allowed to own a bank.”“If India grows at 6.5–7%, credit will expand 11–12%. Retail and SME credit has been growing faster, at 17–18%.We are in the segment witnessing the strongest growth in the industry,” said Rajiv Sabharwal, MD & CEO, Tata Capital.Sabharwal sees Tata Capital riding the twin tailwinds of rapid GDP growth and low credit penetration, with NBFCs expanding faster than the broader market. The Tata brand’s reputation, along with the AAA domestic and sovereign-equivalent global ratings, gives the company a funding edge, enabling it to lend competitively.

In the manufacturing sector, “manufacture of basic metals” at 12.2% and motor vehicles, trailers, and semi-trailers at 9.8% recorded healthy growth.The mining sector grew by 6% in Aug, rising from a contraction of 7.2% in the previous month and a decline of 4.3% in Aug last year. “Notably, consumer non-durables witnessed the steepest contraction in eight months, while the growth in consumer durables halved to 3.5% from 7.3% in July 2025, which may reflect inventory management to avoid stranded taxes ahead of the GST rationalisation,” said Aditi Nayar, chief economist at ratings agency ICRA. Nayar said the infrastructure/construction goods output rose by double digits for the second consecutive month, suggesting that growth in construction activity is likely to have remained healthy.","Industrial output growth moderated in aug, led by manufacturing, which eased during the month.
