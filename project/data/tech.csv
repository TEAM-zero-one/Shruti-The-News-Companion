BENGALURU: Weather permitting, the four-member Axiom-4 mission (Ax-4) crew, including Indian astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla (Shux), is set to undock from the International Space Station (ISS) at around 4.35 pm IST on Monday (July 14).Hours after Steve Stitch, manager, Nasa commercial crew programme had confirmed the undocking date, Axiom Space confirmed the targeted time for undocking, beginning the homeward journey of the crew and culminating with a splashdown and recovery.The crew, which launched on June 25 and docked with the ISS the next day, has completed its planned 14-day tenure at the orbital lab and even “enjoyed a rest day” upon completion of two weeks.Now, even as teams from Axiom, Nasa and SpaceX prepare for the crew’s return to Earth, Commander Peggy Whitson, Pilot Shux, and mission specialists Slawosz Uznanski and Tibor Kapu are making the most of their final days on orbit.The science being done at ISS, Axiom said, was “pushing forward a wide range of experiments that could shape the future of space exploration and improve life on Earth.”From testing of a special champagne bottle to work that could aid in allowing people with diabetes to travel to space, and from irrigating sprouts to gathering data to check if thoughts could control machines, Ax-4 mission had a research complement of around 60 scientific studies, including seven from India.Aside from India, the scientific investigations are from 30 other countries, including the US, Poland, Hungary, Brazil, Nigeria, and Saudi Arabia.“We’re conducting more research studies than any private ISS mission before. It’s not just about science—it’s about international collaboration,” Whitson, the Ax-4 commander and a veteran astronaut, had said earlier.India’s contribution includes a diverse portfolio of experiments in fields like biotechnology, agriculture, and human physiology, designed by institutions across Bengaluru, Dharwad, Thiruvananthapuram, and New Delhi.Among the Indian studies, one from IISc explored how humans interact with electronic screens in microgravity and investigated the resilience of tardigrades- microscopic organisms known for their survival capabilities.An experiment by InStem, Bengaluru, examined the effect of metabolic supplements on muscle regeneration in space, while testing the sprouting of salad seeds, critical for space-based nutrition, was designed by University of Agricultural Sciences, Dharwad.The International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB), with NIPGR, designed the study to examine the behaviour of edible microalgae and cyanobacteria in space conditions. And Isro’s IIST, alongside Kerala Agricultural University, sent experiments to investigate how microgravity influences the growth of food crops.","The four-member axiom-4 mission (ax-4) crew, including indian astronaut shubhanshu shukla (shux), is set to undock from the international space station (iss) on monday.

Friendship on ice: Taylor Swift and Blake Lively ’s once-close bond crumbles

Blake Lively reportedly blames Justin Baldoni—and has a new strategy

It seems not even Taylor Swift ’s most cherished friendships are safe from Hollywood drama. According to insiders, the pop icon has gone radio silent on her longtime best friend Blake Lively—and the catalyst may be actor-director Justin Baldoni. But with Swift’s focus shifting more toward Travis Kelce and her carefully curated inner circle, fans are questioning if the rift is beyond repair.For years, Blake Lively was part of Taylor Swift’s elite inner circle—frequently appearing in behind-the-scenes snaps, attending birthday parties, and even lending her children’s names to Swift’s music. But sources say the two haven't been on speaking terms since Lively’s connection to Baldoni’s It Ends With Us legal drama unexpectedly dragged Swift into the spotlight.“After months of radio silence, Blake has stopped trying to reach out,” one insider revealed. “There is no recovering from this. Their friendship is done.”Fans quickly noticed the silence when Blake failed to like or acknowledge Swift’s celebratory post about reclaiming her music rights—a moment typically met with enthusiastic support from her tight-knit group. Swift, known for being fiercely loyal, apparently took Blake’s perceived alignment with Baldoni personally.Behind the scenes, Lively is said to be frustrated that her public image took a hit due to Baldoni’s legal team’s aggressive tactics. “Blake’s image took a huge hit with all the mud that Justin and his legal team threw at her, she lost her best friend,” a source explained.And now, with Swift's world increasingly dominated by her high-profile romance with NFL star Travis Kelce, it’s clear who has her attention these days. The tight end has become a steady presence in Swift’s whirlwind life, traveling across continents to be by her side. Some insiders believe Swift has re-centered her personal world, pushing out friendships that no longer serve or align with her evolving brand.Still, Blake Lively reportedly isn’t staying quiet. “She’s also looking to build up more high-profile bonds so she can show Taylor she is still a Hollywood heavyweight—and part of that is bitter,” another source added.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s masters win went viral with Jack Antonoff and her cat Meredith—but Travis Kelce quietly made it unforgettable As Swift gears up for another leg of the Eras Tour and Kelce preps for his next NFL season, one thing is certain: there may no longer be space in their storybook romance for past dragons.",Taylor swift and blake lively's friendship appears to have fractured.

Meet the Poker tycoon hosting the star-studded Yacht parties with Tom Brady and Sofia Vergara



While gossip columns have been buzzing with speculation about a rumored romance between Tom Brady and Sofia Vergara, a much more intriguing story has quietly emerged behind the glittering backdrop of luxury yacht parties. The true star of this summer’s most talked-about celebrity gatherings is a man far from the Hollywood spotlight—billionaire entrepreneur Mark Scheinberg.As reported by TMZ, these lavish yacht parties, which have drawn A-listers from across sports, entertainment, and the influencer world, are being orchestrated by none other than Scheinberg, the Israeli-Canadian businessman best known for co-founding PokerStars. “Our sources say it's Israeli-Canadian businessman billionaire Mark Scheinberg's personal floating palace -- and he’s the one treating his famous friends to sun, surf, champagne . .. and some sexy fun,” the outlet revealed.For those unfamiliar with the name, Mark Scheinberg launched PokerStars with his father in 2001. The platform quickly dominated the online poker industry, turning into a global behemoth and eventually selling for a staggering $4.9 billion in 2014.Not one to rest on his laurels, Scheinberg shifted focus to hospitality, founding Mohari Hospitality, which invests in ultra-luxurious properties around the world.Today, he lives on the Isle of Man and boasts an estimated net worth of $5.6 to $6 billion. But Scheinberg’s fortune isn’t just fueling wild parties. Through the Scheinberg Relief Fund, his family has been actively supporting global charities and wildlife preservation efforts.Still, it’s his newfound role as the unofficial “host of the summer” that has raised eyebrows—and curiosity. His opulent private yacht has become the center of some of the most exclusive gatherings of the season. From NFL stars like Brady to Hollywood elites like Vergara, his guest list reads like a who’s who of celebrity culture.But Scheinberg isn’t handling these social affairs solo. Assisting him is longtime friend Doug Chabbott, who helps coordinate the guest lists. However, TMZ noted, “One source claims not every celebrity has said yes to their invitation. They've been turned down by some stars who thought it was odd being they didn't know Mark or Doug.”As for Vergara, while some speculated a budding romance, insiders insist, “Doug’s been linked to her in the past, but we’re told it’s all just friendly fun and nothing romantic.”So while the headlines focused on Brady and Vergara, the real story is the billionaire poker mogul turning heads with his secretive, star-studded floating paradise—proof that sometimes, the most fascinating people are the ones you’ve never heard of.Also Read: ""At the end of the day..."": Patrick Mahomes does not mind being snubbed at NFL top 100, his main goal is something else","Poker tycoon mark scheinberg is the man behind the star-studded yacht parties.

In a bold and aggressive move to dominate the artificial intelligence race, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg is assembling a dream team for the company’s new Superintelligence Lab . The tech giant has reportedly offered record-breaking salary packages ranging from Rs 800 crore to over Rs 1,600 crore to lure top minds from Apple, OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic. The initiative aims to unify Meta’s fragmented AI projects and leap ahead in the race toward superintelligence, an even more ambitious goal than artificial general intelligence (AGI). With key hires and strategic leadership, Meta is now at the center of Silicon Valley’s escalating AI talent war .Meta’s recruitment spree signals a paradigm shift in the global AI race. As Zuckerberg pours billions into building a centralised AI superteam, rivals like OpenAI, Google, and Anthropic will face intensified pressure to retain talent and accelerate innovation. Whether Meta’s Superintelligence Lab will achieve its lofty goals remains to be seen but the talent war has clearly entered an explosive new chapter.Among the standout deals is Apple’s Ruoming Pang, who reportedly joined Meta for a staggering compensation package of $200 million (over Rs 1,600 crore). Similarly, OpenAI’s Trapit Bansal was offered $100 million (approximately Rs 800 crore). According to Bloomberg, these packages include base salary, substantial signing bonuses, and large equity grants with performance-linked clauses and extended vesting schedules, ensuring long-term loyalty. These deals make Meta’s AI salaries among the highest in the corporate world even surpassing many CEO compensation packages at global banks.Meta’s Superintelligence Lab (MSL) is being built to rival OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic in the development of next-gen AI. Zuckerberg has made it clear: AI is the company’s top priority, and he’s willing to pay big to bring the best minds on board. The effort includes unifying Meta’s various AI teams under a central umbrella focused on creating “superintelligence,” a loosely defined concept that goes beyond AGI by outperforming the human brain itself.Meta’s Superintelligence Lab is being led by some of the most high-profile figures in AI and tech:Unlike artificial general intelligence (AGI), which aims to mimic human cognitive functions, superintelligence refers to AI systems that far exceed human intelligence in all domains. While still theoretical, it is seen as the ultimate frontier in AI, capable of solving complex problems across medicine, science, economy, and creativity. By investing in top-tier AI talent and consolidating its resources, Meta aims to leapfrog competitors and become a global leader in the development of superintelligent systems.The massive salary deals are not simple cash payouts. Instead, they typically include:This structure ensures that Meta’s AI hires are financially incentivized to stay long-term and align their success with the company’s stock performance and strategic goals.","Meta ceo mark zuckerberg is assembling a dream team for the company’s new superintelligence lab.

Her creator has not been publicly identified, but the account bio clearly states she is an “AI influencer” and “digital storyteller.” She posted the Wimbledon images on Monday, July 7. The caption read, “Still not over the event… but the party’s a whole other game Which Wimbledon match was your fave?”The post collected nearly 50,000 likes.However, Mia Zelu had disabled the comment section, preventing fans from reacting publicly. That only added to the mystery and debate.This isn’t the first time Mia Zelu has gone viral. Her emotional captions and personal-style posts often mimic human feelings.

YouTube new monetisation rules: Why the 2025 policy targets ‘inauthentic’ uploads



Mass-produced vs repetitious: How YouTube draws the line

Mass-produced clips are generated (often by AI) with minimal variation, for example, hundreds of list videos that differ only in title text.

Repetitious uploads are so alike that a casual viewer gains no fresh value; think lightly cropped re-uploads or looping compilations. To pass review, a creator must add significant commentary, analysis, or creative storytelling, not just filters or speed changes.

2. What exactly counts as “mass-produced” or “repetitious” content?

3. Are AI-generated videos banned from monetisation?

4. Do the subscriber and watch-time thresholds change?

5. What happens if my channel is flagged for inauthentic uploads?

6. Are reaction videos or clip compilations automatically disqualified?

Scroll through YouTube today and you will run into the same pattern again and again: a synthetic voice gliding over stock video, a top-ten list clipped from a news site, or a slideshow padded with royalty-free loops. Advertisers complain, viewers bounce, and original creators watch their work sink beneath low-effort uploads. On 15 July 2025, YouTube will tighten its Partner Programme rules, cutting ad revenue for channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.The entry bar—1,000 subscribers plus either 4,000 public watch hours in 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days—stays the same, but it will no longer be enough on its own. YouTube says the update simply clarifies a long-standing requirement for “original and authentic” videos and gives reviewers better language for spotting spam and AI-generated slop. Creators who ignore the new line risk demonetisation even if their audience numbers look healthy.The support note explains that the platform must “better identify mass-produced and repetitious content” because automated tools now churn out near-identical clips at scale. This includes AI voice essays, templated slideshow channels, and endlessly recycled reaction footage that adds nothing new for viewers.Channels must still hit 1,000 subscribers and the watch-time or Shorts views goal before applying to the Partner Programme. Reviewers will then check recent uploads for authentic value. A channel that relies on reused footage with only minor tweaks can meet the numbers yet fail monetisation.YouTube is not banning AI tools; it is banning lazy AI usage. A synthetic narrator that adds genuine insight over fresh footage can still earn ads. An AI voice that reads a blog post on top of stock clips will likely fail. The same standard applies to templated slideshows or compilations that offer no added context.Separate guidance on YouTube’s help pages confirms that creators must be at least 16 years of age to stream alone. Younger teens can only appear if an adult host runs the broadcast. The rule fits YouTube’s broader push for safety, accountability, and protecting minors from online harassment, inappropriate content, live chat abuse, privacy violations, and potential exploitation during livestreams.They take effect on 15 July 2025 worldwide for all channels in the YouTube Partner Programme .Any video that looks factory-made or repeatedly reuses the same template without adding fresh commentary, education, or entertainment will fall under the new restriction. Typical examples include AI-generated listicles, looped compilations, and near-duplicate slideshow news.No. AI can still be used if the creator adds clear value, original insight, editing, or storytelling. Purely automated clips that read text over stock footage are likely to be demonetised.No. You still need 1,000 subscribers plus 4,000 public watch hours in the last 12 months or 10 million Shorts views in 90 days to apply. The review process, however, will weigh originality more heavily.YouTube’s primary penalty is demonetisation. Ads, Super Chat, and other revenue features shut off until you delete or significantly rework the problematic videos and reapply to YPP.Not necessarily. If the creator adds substantial commentary, transforms the clips, and provides real educational or entertainment value, the videos can still earn revenue. Simple re-uploads or minimal edits will not qualify.","Youtube will ban channels that push “mass-produced, repetitious, or inauthentic” content.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's net worth soars $1 billion as the chipmaker joins the $4 trillion club,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huangs-net-worth-soars-1-billion-as-the-chipmaker-joins-the-4-trillion-club/articleshow/122377958.cms,"Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang

Jensen Huang’s net worth passes $140 billion



Nvidia’s market value climbs above $4 trillion



How a 3.5 percent stake fuels one of the world’s biggest fortunes



Where Jensen Huang now ranks among global billionaires



Why investors keep bidding the price up

AI demand everywhere. Cloud providers, carmakers, and sovereign data-centre projects line up for the current Hopper chips and the coming Blackwell series.

Scarcity premium. Nvidia controls around 80 percent of high-end AI GPU supply, and capacity stays tight even after Taiwan’s fabs ramp up output.

Ecosystem lock-in. CUDA software and support contracts make switching costs high, so even rivals that launch competitive silicon must still lure developers away.

What could slow the rally

Export curbs. The United States still blocks top-tier chips from shipping to China, Nvidia’s largest single-country market outside the U.S.

New competition. AMD, Intel and a clutch of start-ups are readying chips that nibble at Nvidia’s margins, especially in inference workloads.

Rich valuation. At about 40 times forward earnings, the stock leaves little room for an earnings miss; even a small disappointment could yank billions from Huang’s paper wealth.

Nvidia finished trading on July 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold. The jump did more than rewrite Wall Street leaderboards; it also pushed co-founder and Chief Executive Jensen Huang’s fortune past $140 billion. He owns about 3.5 percent of Nvidia, held directly and through family trusts, so every flicker in the share price lands straight in his pocket.Bloomberg’s daily billionaire tally shows Jensen Huang adding roughly $1 billion in a single session, and nearly $28 billion in 2025 so far. That kind of lift puts him shoulder-to-shoulder with household names like Warren Buffett, a spot unthinkable just three years ago. Investors keep paying the premium because Nvidia sells the chips that make modern AI run, from data-centre clusters to enterprise servers. The faster the market grows, the richer Huang becomes.As of the New York closing bell on 10 July, Bloomberg pegged Huang’s net worth at $143 billion, up from about $20 billion in early 2022. That leap happened in stages: $44 billion by mid-2023, $117 billion in late 2024, and now the $140-plus range. The difference this year alone is bigger than the entire market value of some Fortune 500 firms.The company’s share price settled near $164, capping a run that has lifted the stock 74 percent since April’s low and around 22 percent since January. Nvidia is now the dominant weight in the S&P 500, ahead of Apple and Microsoft. Analysts at Citi, Barclays and Loop Capital all raised their price targets this week, citing demand for the upcoming Blackwell platform and a backlog of data-centre orders.Huang’s percentage looks small beside founder holdings at some other tech giants, yet at a $4 trillion valuation it leaves him with shares worth roughly $140 billion. The stake figure comes from Nvidia’s March 2025 proxy filing and excludes unvested stock units. Cash, past dividend income and secondary-share sales round out the number Bloomberg uses, but the equity slice is what matters daily.With the latest move, he edges into Bloomberg’s global top ten, swapping places with Google’s Larry Page and closing in on Warren Buffett. Forbes, which refreshes less often, lists him ninth. None of the other names in that bracket made their money so fast in so short a window.","N nvidia finished trading on july 10 with a market value of just over $4 trillion, the first time any listed firm has crossed that threshold.

New visa rules in Saudi Arabia: Here's everything expats need to know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/new-visa-rules-in-saudi-arabia-heres-everything-expats-need-to-know/articleshow/122290564.cms,"Saudi Arabia introduces a skill-based permit system, transforming the expat workforce/Image: File

Saudi Arabia

’s new visa policy now considers skills, experience, and salary. Expats are grouped into three levels: high-skilled, skilled, and basic.

This change joins with Vision 2030 and big national projects like

NEOM

and

Qiddiya

. While professionals may benefit from this system, it could make life harder for low-wage workers.

Companies face new compliance rules and documentation responsibilities.



Change Has a New Name: Skill-Based Visas

Iran FM Araghchi Meets Saudi's MBS As Netanyahu Makes Big Plans With Trump In US

High-skilled (specialists in engineering, medicine, AI, etc.)

Skilled (those in technical trades and supervisory roles)

Basic (labour-intensive jobs like driving, cleaning, or loading)

Why This Change Now?

NEOM (the futuristic $500B smart city)

Qiddiya (a massive culture and entertainment destination)

The Red Sea Project (a luxury eco-tourism site)

Diriyah Gate (focused on restoring historical identity)

What If You’re Already Working in Saudi?

Your experience and education could help with faster renewals

You may have more job options across sectors

Long-term residency and family sponsorships may be easier to secure

More documents to submit

Delays in visa processing

Potential complications when switching jobs or renewing your permit

A Look Back: How Saudi Arabia Handled Expats Before

What About Employers?

Educational credentials match job roles

Salaries are aligned with the worker's assigned tier

Contracts and employee titles are uploaded correctly in Qiwa

Is Kafala Really Gone?

Leave the country

Bring family members over

Switch jobs

Will Remittances Be Affected?

Fewer low-income workers might enter, reducing overall numbers

But more high-income professionals might send larger amounts individually



The Bigger Picture: Going Digital, Going Smart

The Professional Verification Program – Ensures all credentials are real before workers even arrive

The Wage Protection System – Tracks salary payments in real time

Platforms like Qiwa, Musaned, and Taqat – Handle everything from hiring to filing complaints

The Verdict

FAQs







TL;DR:Ask any expat who’s worked in Saudi Arabia over the last few decades, and they’ll likely tell you the same thing: your job title often defined your life. Whether it was a cleaner, a technician, or a surgeon everyone held the same general residency permit, known as an iqama, regardless of their skill set. That era is now coming to a close.As of July 2025, Saudi Arabia has introduced a completely new work permit system that ranks foreign workers based on their actual qualifications, experience, and income levels. In simpler terms, it’s no longer just about what’s written on your job contract but what you bring to the table.The new structure breaks workers into three categories:Everything is being managed through the Qiwa platform, a digital system under the Ministry of Human Resources. The scoring system considers multiple factors, from education and professional history to age and monthly pay.This reform is tied to something far bigger, that is Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030.his national plan aims to push Saudi beyond oil and into sectors like tourism, technology, and more. And to get there, they need people who can build, code, design, and manage high-level professionals from around the globe.Projects like:These aren’t your run-of-the-mill developments. They require talent that fits modern, niche roles: climate specialists, AI ethicists, or urban mobility planners. That’s where the new visa tiers come in. The country wants to attract the right minds for the job.For expats already living in the Kingdom, the changes started taking effect in mid-June 2025, and the government has given employers a window until August 3 to update records.If you’re a professional, this might actually work in your favour:But if your job falls under the basic category, you might find yourself facing:This shift doesn’t necessarily mean anyone is being pushed out—it just means the criteria are tightening, especially at the lower end of the job market.To understand where things are headed, it helps to revisit where they began.For decades, Saudi Arabia used the kafala system, where a worker’s employer acted as their sponsor. The sponsor had sweeping control over many aspects of the worker’s life, from contract renewals to travel permissions.By the early 2000s, the system started facing criticism, especially from rights organisations. And so, the government began tweaking it.First came Nitaqat in 2011, which rewarded businesses for hiring more Saudi nationals. Later, with Vision 2030, came bigger reforms introducing more job mobility, removing some exit visa restrictions, and slowly moving toward a digitised labour market.Now, with this skill-based model, Saudi Arabia is making its boldest move yet, one that’s meant to fit the demands of a changing economy.If you're running a business in Saudi Arabia, this reform is a real operational shift.HR teams must now ensure:Mistakes here won’t just cause delays, they could result in penalties or rejection of visa applications. For larger firms, these processes might be manageable. But small and medium enterprises will need to adapt quickly or risk falling behind.While the skill-based model is a leap forward, not all older traditions have been removed. In practice, many expats especially in the lower skill brackets still need employer approval to:This shows that while the system is evolving, it still has legacy issues that need ironing out.According to data from early 2025, expats in Saudi Arabia send back over SR12.78 billion ($3.4 billion) every month in remittances.Under the new system:This could reshape how money flows back to India, Bangladesh, and the Philippines, some of the biggest recipients of Gulf remittances.This reform isn’t happening in isolation. It’s part of a larger digital transformation, which includes:The end goal through this mission is a labour market that is traceable, fair, and more efficient.Whether you're a software developer from India, a nurse from the Philippines, or a construction worker from Bangladesh, this change affects you.For some, it may mean greater freedom, faster processing, and better benefits. For others, it might feel like an extra hurdle to stay in a country they’ve long called home.Q. What are the three skill levels in the new visa system?High-skilled (specialists like engineers), Skilled (supervisors), and Basic (manual labour roles like cleaners).Q. Can workers challenge their skill classification?Not directly. But their employer can submit updated documents and request a review through Qiwa.Q. Will this make it easier to bring family to Saudi Arabia?Yes, for workers in the high-skill tier, family sponsorship and long-term residency are more accessible.","Saudi arabia introduces a skill-based permit system, transforming the expat workforce.

"'Nightmare to work with Indians': Citi in London fires woman for racial comment, she now sues bank",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/nightmare-to-work-with-indians-citi-in-london-fires-woman-for-racial-comment-she-now-sues-bank/articleshow/122369922.cms,"Citi Bank London fired a senior employee after she said it was a nightmare to work with Indians.

'Can't remember because of menopause'







Ann Watson, a former Citigroup employee, who was fired in 2023 for her comment that it was a nightmare to work with Indians, has now sued the bank alleging that she was unfairly discriminated. Watson was giving an internal job interview in which she told an Indian-origin interviewer that her project failed because she was working with a team of Indians. ""No offense to you,"" she said noting that the interviewer was also of Indian-origin.“The project failed because I was working with a team of Indians. No offense to you, Kapil, but you know what Indians are like to work with it’s a nightmare,” she allegedly said.When she made the comment, the interview was stopped and Watson was asked to wait in the online waiting room. When the interview resumed, she said, ""Now it's your chance, Kapil, to get me back.""The HR team later contacted her after a month of the interview and said she was fired for her racial comment.“I was horrified to hear these as I would not blame a culture or country for any kind of failure or direct any such comments toward an interview panel that I was applying for a role with,” she said in her witness statement prepared for the London hearing.Watson said she did not deny making the comment but she could not recall it because of the symptoms of long Covid-19 and menopause. She said she was remorseful though she has no recollection of what she said.Citi said its investigation into Watson was fair and impartial, and stood by the decision to fire her. Watson said the firing was too harsh and it did not take into account her 12 years of service at the bank and came at a time when she was going through a tough menopause. The bank said her menopause condition could not have made or contributed to the racist comments that she made.","Ann watson, a former citigroup employee, was fired in 2023 for her comment that it was a nightmare to work with indians.

"UK’s largest fact-checking firm, with India-born founder, folds up",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/uks-largest-fact-checking-firm-with-india-born-founder-folds-up/articleshow/122287992.cms,"Lyric Jain, Founder & CEO, Logically.





Logically, Britain’s largest fact-checking company started by an India-born entrepreneur that once had assignments from Indian, UK and US govts as well as social media giants, has gone into “administration” -- a legal process where a debt-defaulting firm seeks court protection to restructure and avoid liquidation.One of the key reasons why Logically, founded by Lyric Jain in 2017, folded up was social media giants moving away from AI-enabled fact checking. Meta and TikTok did not renew their contracts this year. Pressure on social media giants to fact-check has eased since US President Donald Trump took charge the second time early this year. Logically’s assets have been transferred to another company called Kreatur as part of the “administration” process.Jain had founded Logically with backing from private investors. He had moved to the UK from Mysore at age 12. The company’s clients included US federal agencies, India’s Election Commission, Mumbai police, Karnataka, J&K and Assam govts. It also worked for Britain’s counter-disinformation unit during the pandemic and on debunking disinformation ahead of 2020 US elections.Having won lucrative fact-checking contracts with TikTok and Meta earlier, Logically once boasted over 100 staff in the UK, India and US.“The cost of doing fact-checking was getting increasingly expensive. When TikTok’s contract came up for renewal they offered a paltry amount not sufficient for running the technology. So, they went their separate ways. Meta did not renew because it was moving towards community-led fact checkers,” a source close to Logically told TOI.Around the same time, the firm lost certification from International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), allegedly because the industry body does not allow fact-checkers to work for govts.UK’s The Times newspaper claimed Logically being hired by Karnataka govt in early 2024 to set up a fact-checking unit to parse misinformation ahead of the Lok Sabha elections last summer led to the firm losing its certification. However, a source contested that version. “Karnataka govt did a proof of concept contract with Logically but nothing has happened ever since. IFCN does not have a monopoly on fact-checking,” the source said.The same source disputed claims about Logically “losing” certification. “We didn’t renew it. Fact-checking with platforms was not an attractive business. Logically was gradually winding up that side of business to focus on corporate and govt customers for information advantage and providing competitive intelligence,” the source said.A spokesperson for Kreatur, to which Logically’s assets have been channelled, confirmed the move. “Kreatur Ltd has acquired Logically’s core technology, brand, and key assets as part of a pre-pack administration process. The transaction ensures continuity for all customers and has preserved over 50 full-time roles,” the spokesperson said.","Logically, britain’s largest fact-checking company started by an india-born entrepreneur, has gone into “administration’ logically once had assignments from indian, uk and us govts as well as social media giants.
