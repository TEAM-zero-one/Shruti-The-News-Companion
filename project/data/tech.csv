Isro to launch its heaviest US commercial sat BlueBird-6 on December 15,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/isro-to-launch-its-heaviest-us-commercial-sat-bluebird-6-on-december-15/articleshow/125897729.cms,"ISRO Makes History As ‘Bahubali’ Rocket Places India’s Heaviest Communication Satellite In Orbit

NEW DELHI: In a boost to Indo-US space cooperation, Isro will launch its heaviest American commercial communication low-earth orbit satellite, the 6.5-tonne BlueBird-6, from the Sriharikota spaceport on Dec 15. Isro’s ‘Bahubali’ rocket LVM3 will put the US satellite into orbit.AST SpaceMobile, a Texas-based company that has built the space-based cellular broadband network, said, “BlueBird-6, a US licensed satellite, is scheduled to launch on Dec 15. It is the first of AST SpaceMobile’s next-generation satellites. When launched, it will feature the largest commercial phased array in low earth orbit at nearly 2,400 sqft. This represents 3.5 times increase in size over BlueBirds 1-5 and supports ten times the data capacity. ”BlueBird-6 is a “Block-2” satellite and part of a larger plan by AST SpaceMobile to deploy a series of satellites to achieve non-continuous service, with further launches scheduled through 2026. Its aim is to bridge the “digital divide” by offering fast, unhindered direct-to-device mobile broadband service in areas with poor or non-existent terrestrial network coverage.The BlueBird satellites are designed to deliver a high amount of bandwidth, with each unit capable of up to 10,000 MHz. They operate by partnering with existing mobile network carriers to enhance their networks using licensed spectrum.The BlueBird-6 satellite arrived in India from the US on Oct 19. It was later transported by road to Sriharikota for integration with launcher LVM3, fuelling and final checks ahead of its launch.The liftoff is being handled by New Space India Limited (NSIL), Isro’s commercial wing. LVM-3 had recently put India’s heaviest CMS-3 satellite, weighing 4.4 tonnes, into its orbit on Nov 2. A three-stage launch vehicle, LVM3 rocket can carry payloads weighing up to 8,000 kg to low-Earth orbit (LEO) and 4,000 kg to geosynchronous transfer orbit (GTO). The human-rated version of this vehicle will fly three Indian astronauts to space, as part of the Gaganyaan mission, which is planned for 2027.","Isro will launch its heaviest american commercial communication low-earth orbit satellite, the 6.5-tonne bluebird-6, from sriharikota spaceport on dec 15.

NEW DELHI: Textiles, apparel and hospitality could generate the strongest job growth by 2030, driven by higher investment in these sectors, according to a new report by economic policy think tank NCAER, which also called for measures to remove bottlenecks for faster expansion.Moderate growth in manufacturing and services output could raise jobs in textiles, garments and related industries by 53%, and employment in trade, hotels and similar services by 79% by 2030. While the economy displayed robust expansion in recent times, the report stated job quality did not keep pace as most employment gains came from self-employment (largely in agriculture) rather than from stable, salaried work.""India's employment strategy must go beyond setting aggregrate growth target to attaining calibrated mix of demand side and supply side measures that directly incentivise labour absorption,"" it said.On the supply side, it called for skill development through strengthened vocational programmes, credit portability to allow students to move across institutions, deeper industry partnerships and more investment in training quality.It stated India's labour force participation rate of about 50% was low compared to other nations with the same income level, and a major challenge for growth was dominance of the informal sector.","Textiles, apparel, and hospitality are poised for significant job growth by 2030.

Troy Aikman takes shots at Fox

Also Read:

ESPN analyst and former Dallas Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman has offered his clearest explanation yet for why he left FOX Sports after more than two decades and his comments point directly to leadership at his old network. Speaking on Sports Media with Richard Deitsch , Aikman said the move was less about chasing a bigger platform and more about how communication broke down behind the scenes.Aikman contrasted his experience at FOX with the more corporate, layered structure at ESPN. Calling ESPN “a conglomerate” and “like the U.S. government,” Aikman noted that FOX once felt far more direct and personal.“At Fox, it was really more of a mom-and-pop operation because of David Hill and Ed Gorin,” he said, describing how early network leaders handled decision-making and talent issues personally. Even after leadership changed, he said, executives like Eric Shanks and Brad Zager continued that model - at least initially.But when it came to his own contract situation in 2022, Aikman claimed that communication suddenly evaporated. Despite being one of FOX’s most recognizable faces, he said key executives did not give him clarity about his future.Aikman revealed that he never received a final offer from FOX before his move to ESPN.Instead, he said the network simply congratulated him after news broke that he had signed a new deal.“The reason that I’m no longer at Fox is mostly due to a lack of communication,” Aikman said. “Which is ironic since we’re in the communications business.”Aikman said he specifically asked FOX Sports CEO Eric Shanks about comments he’d heard regarding his contract status, but Shanks declined to address them. According to Aikman, longtime broadcasting partner Joe Buck also raised similar questions, and got the same lack of response.“I never had a conversation with Eric Shanks until he called to congratulate me on the ESPN contract,” Aikman said. “Joe had asked him the same questions… and he refused to answer.”Now ESPN’s lead NFL analyst under a reported $65 million net worth, Aikman says he enjoys the network’s scale and professionalism, even if it’s more “corporate” than FOX. He has also made headlines recently for criticizing college football’s NIL system after a UCLA recruit failed to thank him for a donation, a misunderstanding later attributed to school policy.But regarding his exit from FOX, Aikman remains firm: the issue wasn’t money or opportunity, but communication. And for one of the NFL’s most respected broadcast voices, that was the deal-breaker.","Troy aikman says he never received a final offer from fox before his move to espn.

Baker Mayfield and Emily Wilkinson’s combined net worth



Baker Mayfield has always lived in that unpredictable space where talent meets turbulence. Every twist in his NFL story has shaped how fans see him today. He has gone from college star to top draft pick, from being praised in Cleveland to bouncing across teams that never seemed ready to commit. Yet this winding path didn’t weaken his name. It strengthened it. It gave him a brand built on grit, confidence, and a willingness to bet on himself.That same willingness carried him through seasons where the stakes felt heavier than the spotlight. From record-breaking rookieman energy to a prove-it season in Tampa Bay worth only $4 million, Mayfield kept pushing until the league was forced to view him differently. His deals eventually reflected his climb, but what truly stands out is how his personal world grew right along with it, shaped largely by the woman who has been with him through every high and low.Money often follows influence, and together, Baker Mayfield and Emily Wilkinson bring both. Mayfield currently plays on a three-year, $100 million contract with the Buccaneers. The deal includes $50 million in total guarantees and $40 million guaranteed at signing with a $28.9 million signing bonus.His annual $33.3 million salary puts him among the highest-earning players in the league. According to reputable outlets such as Celebrity Net Worth, Baker Mayfield’s net worth in 2025 is $50 million.Wilkinson has carved her own place financially as well. Her work across bartending, patient coordination, modeling, and later influencing helped her find a steady lane long before she stepped into the NFL spotlight. Her collaborations, brand promotions, and media presence eventually built a career worth around $1 million. “Emily Wilkinson’s current net worth stands at $1 million approximately,” supported in part by an estimated $300,000 yearly income from partnerships, hair-care advice, brand deals, and work with well-known skincare companies such as Rodan+Fields. the couple's combined networth is at around $52 million.Their financial success is rooted in two very different backstories. Mayfield’s football rise began at Lake Travis High School, where he completed 429 passes for 6,255 yards with 67 touchdowns and eight interceptions. Wilkinson’s path started in Nebraska, followed by a move to Los Angeles where she juggled jobs and discovered who she wanted to be. The marriage they built in 2019 blended those paths into one steady partnership.Today, the couple shares influence that reaches beyond money. They show stability in a world that rarely hands it out freely, reminding fans that behind the touchdowns and brand deals are two people working as one through every season life sends their way.Also Read: Russell Wilson vs Ciara Net Worth: how the Giants QB’s massive career income compares to the Grammy winner’s empire","Baker mayfield and emily wilkinson’s combined net worth is at around $52 million.

Breaking down the couple’s combined value and individual earnings in the current WWE industry

How endorsements, personal ventures and long-term planning shape their future financial position

Seth Rollins and Becky Lynch have gradually built one of the strongest financial profiles in professional wrestling, and their combined success in 2025 reflects several years of headline billing, growing sponsorship demand, and carefully chosen outside ventures that keep expanding their reach far beyond the ring.The couple’s earning power continues rising as WWE pushes deeper into global touring markets and new media deals, giving both performers a level of exposure that reliably converts into merchandise sales, appearance fees, and long-term brand recognition.Most reliable industry evaluations place Becky Lynch’s personal net worth at roughly $7 million, supported by her multi-year WWE contract, book royalties, acting projects, and the consistently high volume of merchandise tied to her long-standing popularity, while Seth Rollins’ estimated net worth has reached nearly $12 million due to a higher base salary, extended main-event longevity, and additional income from mainstream appearances and training-academy operations.Their joint net worth is centred around $19 million in 2025, though analysts say this value increases or changes by a few dollars depending on performance bonuses based on major live events and international stadium shows.It is believed that Rollins makes nearly $3 million annually with bonus payments on the high-performing live events, and Lynch is considered to earn more than $1.5 million in a year, not counting her brand endorsements and off-WWE media appearances.Both of the superstars have diversified well beyond WWE pay schemes which serve as a stabilizer in the long-term financial position during the cycle of contracts, injury leaves, or schedule changes which are inherent parts of a wrestling career.Lynch is raking in consistent royalties with her autobiography and her television and film appeal offers secondary revenue that just fits well in WWE's responsibilities and she has a wider platform than most full-time performers. His wrestling academy in Iowa has since become a reputable training facility providing a reliable source of secondary revenue and enhancing his professional legacy by creating talent.Their social-media presence in the aggregate, with a follower base of more than 10 million people on various social-media platforms, has a significant financial implication, as it provides them with leverage of high value in brand campaigns and negotiations where the leverage is significant.As WWE continues to increase disbursement to performers with international diversification and improved broadcast agreements, both Rollins and Lynch are clearly in a position to increase their personal fortunes as the company takes increased strides into international markets and multimedia content.Also Read: Where and how to watch Saturday Night's Main Event: Complete viewing guide for John Cena's last match","Seth rollins and becky lynch have built one of the strongest financial profiles in professional wrestling.

Also Read:

On December 10, Jon Rhoades of The Big Ten Huddle shared a swirl of rumors, much of it traced back to Justin Spiro (Host of “The Spiro Avenue Show”), who first broke news about former head coach Sherrone Moore. Spiro had been hinting since mid-August, even before the season began, that Moore could face serious trouble or even be fired by the University of Michigan. After the Ohio State game, Spiro predicted Moore’s dismissal could come within a week or as late as two months.The heart of the rumor is that Moore was fired due to an alleged relationship with Paige Shiver, his executive assistant, who was promoted when Moore took over for Jim Harbaugh. Now, the latest twist claims Shiver is pregnant and that Moore is confirmed as the father. Paige Shiver’s news has sent shock waves through cyberspace. But Shiver’s ties to football run deeper than college sidelines. She is the daughter of Jeff Shiver, a respected NFL scout. To understand her father’s story, let’s revisit Dan Pompei’s 2019 biographical interview in The Athletic.On a spring day in 1987, Jeff Shiver was flipping a hamburger in his Lafayette, Indiana, kitchen when the phone rang with a call that would change his life.Bill Tobin, the Chicago Bears’ personnel chief, was on the line, offering Shiver a chance to join the NFL’s scouting ranks. At the time, Shiver was earning $18,000 a year as a BLESTO scout, but Tobin’s offer of $25,000 felt like striking gold. Shiver eagerly accepted, feeling as if he had just won the lottery.As they sealed the deal with a handshake, Tobin promised, “You’re going to be with the Bears a long time.” More than three decades later, Shiver is still a fixture in Chicago, outlasting every other personnel man in the team’s hundred-year history. Only Scott DiStefano has served (five years) longer as a continuously employed NFL scout for the Denver Broncos. From fullback Brad Muster in 1988 to running back David Montgomery in 2019, Shiver has played a role in every Bears draft pick.“Jeff worked out even better than I thought,” Tobin said via The Athletic in 2019. “He’s a wonderful person and damn good scout. He’s been a giant in the scouting industry.”“I think the world of him,” said former Bears general manager Jerry Angelo. “I don’t know of anybody more respected and or revered in the scouting business than Jeff. I saw it from afar when I was with other teams, and I saw it firsthand when I got to Chicago. Whatever he says, you can take it to the bank.”Shiver credits his impeccable endurance to his faith and to Laura, his wife of 34 years (at the time of the 2019 The Athletic interview, now they’ve been together for roughly 40 long years). “It’s a hard job,” Shiver said. “To be able to do it begins with a great wife. Not once did I walk in the front door and hear her complain about me not being there.”Laura’s patience is all the more monumental given that Shiver spends up to 275 nights a year away from home, crisscrossing the country in his Ford Edge and tallying about 30,000 miles annually. Life on the road has brought him moments of pure bliss, like hearing, “Honey, I think I’m pregnant,” and heartache, like learning, “Your brother-in-law was in a car accident, and he didn’t make it.” His fondest travel memories are the late-night phone calls from his young children, Brittany, John, Paige, and Nicole, soft voices asking, “Dad, when are you coming home?”The former Bears general manager, Ryan Pace, told The Athletic in 2019 that Shiver’s experience on the staff is invaluable. Think about the relationships he’s built and the resources he has. He can call people and get information that a younger scout can’t. He also has a mental library of players.In a draft meeting, he’ll quickly point out when one player reminds him of another and explain why. Sometimes, he’ll mention players from way back that nobody else remembers. David Montgomery reminds Shiver a bit of Matt Forte. He does a great job of describing players. He has a million one-liners that make everyone laugh. He brings passion and energy while keeping things fun.Rod Graves, the former Bears personnel director, told The Athletic in 2019 that he always relied on Jeff for core evaluation. He would be shocked if Ryan (Pace) and those who followed did not lean on Jeff in the same way. Shiver was the definition of dependability, an astute evaluator, and someone Graves trusted without a doubt. Few people ranked higher on his list, both as friends and as professionals. Graves has only praise for Shiver and says with complete honesty that he loves the man.Dan Pompei of The Athletic revealed in 2019 that one of the earliest and most profound lessons Shiver absorbed as an NFL scout was to appreciate everyone he encountered, not just those with influence or something to offer. He made it a point to value the everyday people: the gas station attendant, the custodian, the security guard. Shiver’s philosophy was simple: the mission never outweighs the people you meet along the way: “The mission never is greater than the people you come in contact with. ”Pompei also painted a picture of Shiver’s upbringing, shaped by his late parents, John and Myrtle. Jeff inherited his strong work ethic from his father, who spent over 80 years as an auto mechanic at Shiver’s Auto Service, often working twelve-hour days, six days a week. During World War II, John served as a flight engineer and gunner in the Army Air Corps. Meanwhile, Myrtle managed the books and cared for Jeff and his two sisters.Talking to Pompei in 2019, Jeff said he still feels his mother’s love when he bakes her Sour Cream Pound Cake. And when the call came that brought him to the Bears’ front office, he was in the middle of cooking a hamburger. Distracted by the life-changing news, he burned it, but as he told Pompei, it was still the best burger he ever tasted: “By far, the best burger I ever tasted.”Jeff Shiver currently serves as Executive Scout for the Chicago Bears.",Jeff shiver has been with the chicago bears for more than three decades.

Paige Shiver’s personal life: What we know so far





Whispers around the Michigan football program have grown louder in recent days, pulling one name into the center of a storm she never addressed publicly. Paige Shiver, a staff member in the University of Michigan athletic department, has become the subject of widespread speculation after social media users connected her to the “inappropriate relationship” that led to the dismissal of head coach Sherrone Moore. As the rumors circulated, her online activity drew even more attention, especially when her accounts went quiet during the height of the discussion. The university has not identified the staff member involved, but curiosity online has only increased.This sudden spotlight has pushed Shiver, who rarely appeared in public conversations about the team, into a narrative she has never confirmed. According to Larry Brown Sports, Shiver is listed as the “Executive Assistant” to the head coach, a role that naturally placed her near program operations. When Moore was fired on December 10, 2025, after officials cited an “inappropriate relationship,” speculation quickly turned toward anyone who worked closely with him. Although none of the allegations have been verified, the internet filled the silence with theories, further magnifying Shiver’s name.According to Larry Brown Sports, Paige Shiver was promoted to Sherrone Moore’s executive assistant in 2024 after serving as an on-campus recruiting staffer.She joined Michigan in November 2021 and, over time, became a familiar presence within football operations. Her family has deep roots in the sport. Her father, Jeff Shiver, is a long-time scout for the Chicago Bears, and her uncle, Emerson Kampen III, is known for his work in basketball analysis.Paige Shiver’s education traces back to Purdue University, where she built a foundation in nonprofit and athletic administration. Before moving into college sports, she worked in development, marketing, and fundraising for the Muscular Dystrophy Association. A feature published by the Chicago Bears in 2016 also revealed that she has Pompe Disease, a rare progressive disorder requiring weekly treatments that changed her athletic lifestyle.The attention surrounding her name grew once reports noted that her Instagram account became private and her X and LinkedIn profiles were deactivated on December 10, 2025. Neither she nor Moore has commented on the claims that tied them to an alleged affair or the rumor involving a pregnancy and abortion. With no confirmation from any official source, the claims remain unverified. Her personal life, including her dating history, also remains unknown, leaving much of the conversation built on speculation rather than facts.Also Read: Why Sherrone Moore ended up in police custody amid Michigan firing him for alleged ‘inappropriate relationship’ scandal",Paige shiver is a staff member in the university of michigan athletic department.

Where Metaverse budget cuts may go

Wall Street says: We are with you on this

Meta reportedly delays MR glasses

The day Facebook changed its name to Meta

To build the Metaverse'





Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg seems to have finally realised that one of the company's biggest bets—Metaverse—is not working (or not working as expected). It is also the technology that the company changed its very name after. In 2021, after 17 years of being called Facebook, the social networking parent company behind Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus changed its name to Meta. Now according to a report from Bloomberg, Meta is likely to slash its Reality Labs budget, shaving off as much as 30%. The proposed metaverse cuts are reportedly part of the company's annual budget planning for 2026, which included a series of meetings at Zuckerberg's compound in Hawaii last month.For those unaware, Metaverse unit works on virtual reality headsets and a VR-based social network, which produces the company's Quest mixed-reality headsets, smart glasses made with EssilorLuxottica's Ray-Ban and upcoming augmented-reality glasses. Meta has struggled to sell its vision of an immersive metaverse of interconnected virtual worlds and expand the market for its devices beyond the niche of the gaming community.Analysts see the move reflecting the overall lack of interest in products like Meta’s social virtual reality platform Horizon Worlds, as well as its virtual reality hardware—both in the industry at large, as well as among consumers.Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s Metaverse vision has posted more than $70 billion in losses over the past four years. Little doubt then that Facebook parent's shares rose 4% as the move eased some investor jitters over a bet that CEO Mark Zuckerberg has backed with billions of dollars. ""Smart move, just late,"" told Huber Research Partners analyst Craig Huber to Bloomberg. He added, ""This seems a major shift to align costs with a revenue outlook that surely is not as prosperous as management thought years ago. ""So, what may really be troubling Metaverse? No one can really pinpoint. But as a report in Fortune says, for many people, the problem is that the value proposition is unclear; Metaverse simply doesn’t yet deliver a must-have reason to ditch their smartphones or laptops.Reality Labs is made up of a Metaverse unit and a wearables unit. Within the Metaverse unit, executives are reportedly considering making cuts to VR jobs. As the report says, cuts in resources that high are most likely to include layoffs as early as January.The report comes as Meta scrambles to stay relevant in Silicon Valley's artificial-intelligence race after its Llama 4 model met with a poor reception. To fuel its ambitious goals, Meta has committed as much as $72 billion in capital spending this year. The company reorganized its AI efforts under Superintelligence Labs earlier this year, with Zuckerberg said to be personally leading an aggressive talent acquisition, floating offers for startups and directly courting prospects on WhatsApp with million-dollar pay packages. In fact, Meta's big hiring is said to have triggered a talent war in the Silicon Valley.Last month, Meta Platforms said that it will invest $600 billion in the US infrastructure and jobs over the next three years, including artificial intelligence data centers. Meta has doubled down on AI, with a target of achieving superintelligence. Zuckerberg said Meta is building compute because ""it's the right strategy to aggressively front-load capacity so we're prepared for the most optimistic cases,"" on the company's recent earnings call. Meta has forecast ""notably larger"" capital expenses next year thanks to investments in artificial intelligence, including aggressively building data centers to power its AI push.Incidentally, earlier this week, Zuckerberg announced that Alan Dye, a longtime designer at Apple, is joining Meta to lead a new creative studio inside the Reality Labs division that would focus on design, fashion and technology. Dye will report to Andrew Bosworth, Meta’s chief technology officer, who leads Reality Labs. “We’re entering a new era where A.I. glasses and other devices will change how we connect with technology and each other,” Mr. Zuckerberg said in a post to Threads. “With this new studio, we’re focused on making every interaction thoughtful, intuitive, and built to serve people.”Wall Street sent a clear signal to Meta Platforms that it wants the company to reduce spending on Reality Labs. Wall Street is sending a clear signal to Meta Platforms that it wants the company to reduce spending on Reality Labs. Meta Platforms shares jumped 3.4% on reports that the company was cutting Metaverse spending in favor of AI and smart glasses.Meta has reportedly delayed the launch of its Mixed Reality Glasses (MR Glasses) from the second half of 2026 to the first half of 2027. According to a report in Business Insider, Meta executives announced the delay after meetings with CEO Mark Zuckerberg is said to have told the team to take more time to make the business sustainable and deliver higher quality experiences. The company’s Metaverse leaders Gabriel Aul and Ryan Cairns reportedly told team that the delay is “going to give us a lot more breathing room to get the details right. ”Facebook already sells VR headsets and Ray-Ban smart glasses. The form factor of Meta's upcoming Glasses will reportedly be similar to that of Apple Vision Pro, with may be more power.In October 2021, after 17 years of being called Facebook, the social networking giant behind Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Oculus got a new name. Facebook’s corporate entity became Meta. Mark Zuckerberg announced the change at the company’s AR/VR-focused Connect event, sharing that the new title captured more of the company’s core ambition: '. Analysts saw name change as the right move, as Instagram was -- and continues to be -- more valuable than Facebook. Along with WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger, the four apps are known as Meta's Family of Apps. The name change to Meta Platforms is also said to have reflected an increased emphasis on engaging through virtual worlds. Incidentally, the name change to Meta from Facebook was followed by a sharp decline in company's stock price, which fell 64.2% in 2022 compared to a 33.1% decrease in the Nasdaq that year.","$70 billion in losses and counting.layoffs may be coming to meta.

I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about how technology can make systems more efficient, equitable, and accessible.

But I’ve learned over the years that the best way to understand how something works, or where it breaks, is to go straight to the people using it.

That’s why I’ll be joining the Phia customer experience team for a day this week. Phia is a fashion-tech tool built to make shopping smarter and more sustainable, and it’s the brainchild of my daughter Phoebe Gates and her co-founder

Sophia Kianni

.

They’ve built an app and browser extension that helps people shop smarter by finding the best prices, surfacing secondhand options, and showing lower-impact alternatives across thousands of online retailers.

It’s been inspiring to watch them tackle a massive challenge, rethinking the way we shop, by meeting users where they are.

And now, I’ll be doing the same.

Looking forward to getting back into the startup scene. Hopefully, I won’t break anything (no promises).

💻Or if you shop on your computer like me, they have a free chrome extension at gophia.com

Let me know what you think! You never know who’s on the other end of the customer service line…”

How the latest funding round will help Phoebe Gates Phia app

“There are enough clothes on the planet for the next six generations. We don’t need to buy new clothes.

The rise in secondhand fashion is really exciting. We just need to make it a lot easier for consumers.”

However, Phoebe Gates’ father has yet to invested in the venture. Instead, the Bill Gates donated his time and experience to her daughter’s startup. Earlier this year, the tech billionaire took to professional networking site LinkedIn to announce that he was doing a customer service shift to support the team in the days following the launch of the app. He said when a daughter asks for help at her startup, the only right answer is yes.In his LinkedIn post, Bill Gates shared a short clip offering a glimpse of his shift working in the customer service department of his daughter’s app. He wrote:The latest round of funding is a massive leap in value for Phoebe Gates' startup, coming just months after the New York-based company finished its first fundraising round.

Kianni also took a break from her studies so that she could quickly learn everything about the industry they were going to work in, she told Vogue.Earlier, Phoebe Gates told Elle that when she first floated the idea to her parents, Bill and Melinda Gates, they urged her to treat it as a side project.

TCS Layoffs: Maharashtra labour minister Aakash Fundkar gives written reply in Vidhan Parishad on TCS layoffs,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/maharashtra-labour-minister-aakash-fundkar-gives-written-reply-in-vidhan-parishad-on-tcs-layoffs/articleshow/125886840.cms,"TCS layoffs: Legislative concerns

TCS HR chief Sudeep Kunnumal on layoffs in future





Maharashtra labour minister Aakash Fundkar has now informed that the state legislative council that around 376 employees of Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) were laid off at the company’s Pune campuses over the past two quarters of the current fiscal year. The disclosure was made via a hand written reply during the Vidhan Parishad session, after concerns were raised by members over reports of widespread layoffs in the IT sector.Fundkar further clarified that the layoffs were not linked to artificial intelligence or automation, addressing speculation that job losses were part of a broader restructuring driven by new technologies. In the Vidhan Parishad, Fundkar revealed that the company fired 376 employees from its Pune campus and the round of layoffs mainly impacted middle and senior-level managers.As reported by new agency PTI, during the Question Hour, the legislators including Uma Khare and Prasad Lad raised questions about increasing job losses in the technology sector and the impact of AI adoption on employment. The reply by the minister is sought to provide transparency by citing official data received directly from TCS.The Maharashtra government also stressed in the fact that while the layoffs have occurred, they are not on the scale suggested by media reports of mass layoffs across multiple cities.The minister further assured the council that the government is monitoring developments in the IT sector closely, given its importance to employment and state’s economy.Recently, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) HR head Sudeep Kunnumal recently addressed concerns over potential layoffs at the IT giant. Speaking during the company’s Q2 earnings call earlier this month, Kunnumal said that TCS is not “chasing a target” when it comes to job cuts. Instead, the IT firm said it will evaluate “everyone”.During the earnings call, analyst Surendra Goyal from Citi asked: “The (second) question is with the release of 1% workforce, the headcount declined by 20,000 people or 3%. And what you had announced earlier was 2%. So should we expect a similar kind of head count reduction in the next quarter as well?”TCS HR head Sudeep Kunnumal replied to the question saying: “So almost -- see, the 20,000 head count is a factor of voluntary and involuntary attrition. So you should see that. But as we announced, against the 2 percentage, we have midway, so we have done approximately 1 percentage of it. And like what Krithi just mentioned, we don't have a target.”",Around 376 employees of tata consultancy services (tcs) were laid off at the company’s pune campuses over the past two quarters of the current fiscal year.

"OpenAI launches GPT 5.2 with advanced capabilities, to compete with Google’s Gemini 3",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/openai-launches-gpt-5-2-with-advanced-capabilities-to-compete-with-googles-gemini-3/articleshow/125925004.cms,"Coding with GPT 5.2





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has launched GPT-5.2 artificial intelligence model, days after CEO Sam Altman issued an internal ""code red"" pausing internal projects and redirecting teams to accelerate development. This comes as a response to Google 's Gemini 3 that was launched last month. Announcing the new model, OpenAI said “We designed GPT‑5.2 to unlock even more economic value for people; it’s better at creating spreadsheets, building presentations, writing code, perceiving images, understanding long contexts, using tools, and handling complex, multi-step projects.”As revealed by the company, the new models is aimed to bring more economic value for users.“GPT‑5.2 Thinking sets a new state-of-the-art score, and is our first model that performs at or above a human expert level. Specifically, GPT‑5.2 Thinking beats or ties top industry professionals on 70.9% of comparisons on GDPval knowledge work tasks, according to expert human judges. These tasks include making presentations, spreadsheets, and other artifacts,” the company said.OpenAI says that GPT‑5.2 Thinking sets a new state of the art of 55.6% on SWE-Bench Pro, a rigorous evaluation of real-world software engineering.Unlike SWE-bench Verified, which only tests Python, SWE-Bench Pro tests four languages and aims to be more contamination-resistant, challenging, diverse, and industrially relevant.On SWE-bench Verified (not plotted), GPT‑5.2 Thinking scored 80%, as claimed by the AI maker. “For everyday professional use, this translates into a model that can more reliably debug production code, implement feature requests, refactor large codebases, and ship fixes end-to-end with less manual intervention,” it said.OpenAI further claims GPT‑5.2 Thinking hallucinates less than GPT‑5.1 Thinking. On a set of de-identified queries from ChatGPT, responses with errors were 30%rel less common. For professionals, this means fewer mistakes when using the model for research, writing, analysis, and decision support—making the model more dependable for everyday knowledge work.","Chatgpt-maker openai has launched gpt-5.2 artificial intelligence model.
