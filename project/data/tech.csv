Poll What is the most inspiring part of Vikas's story? His humility in charging only the standard fare His calmness and quick action

A driver who became a hero



A call to appreciate his kindness



Social media joins the effort

A simple cab ride turned into an unforgettable moment of kindness when a Rapido driver in Gurugram went beyond his duty to assist in the delivery of a baby inside his vehicle.The heartwarming story was shared by a Reddit user, Rohan Mehra, who narrated how the driver’s selflessness made all the difference in a time of crisis.Mehra had booked a Rapido cab for his cook, whose wife was in labour and urgently needed to reach the hospital. However, during the journey, her pain intensified, and before they could reach their destination, she gave birth to a baby boy inside the vehicle.The Rapido driver, identified as Vikas, did not panic. Instead, he stepped up and assisted in the delivery, ensuring both the mother and newborn were safe. He then drove them to the hospital without any delay.What made the incident even more special was Vikas’ humility. Despite the extraordinary circumstances, he only charged the standard fare displayed on the app and did not ask for any extra payment.Mehra, deeply touched by the driver’s kindness, wanted to do something to appreciate him. However, since he had not called the driver before the ride, he was unable to retrieve his number after the trip ended.Taking to Reddit, he urged Rapido co-founder Pavan Guntupalli to help locate Vikas so they could express their gratitude.“I would like to request Rapido and Pavan Guntupalli to help us reach that driver. His name was Vikas and I have also provided the ride details below,” Mehra wrote, sharing screenshots of the ride.Many Reddit users were moved by the story and suggested sharing it on platforms like Twitter and LinkedIn to help Rapido recognise and reward Vikas.“Share on LinkedIn. Rapido loves to recognise their drivers and even reward them in a few cases,” one user suggested.Another commented, “The kind of Vikas we need.”This heartwarming act of kindness proves that heroes exist everywhere, even behind the wheel of a cab.","Rohan mehra had booked a rapido cab for his cook, whose wife was in labour.

The line moves from a dot to a grid. The grid expands into patterns of structure that pause, create and slowly disperse into a formlessness that celebrates control and freedom of the breath, the mind, and the space in between. All of this takes place in the now, in the present, in the contemporary. Time moves in the form of constant nowness in Trishla Jain’s work. The two series, ‘ Yantra ’ and ‘ Tantra ’, may initially stand starkly apart from each other but, on slow immersion through time spent with each painting, the dots and dashes configure themselves differently across canvases to create new compositions. These configurations resonate with the present, which arises from a mindfulness associated with discovering the expanse of space between the breath and the mind that exists within each of us.The mind, breath, and space are three important anchors to understanding and experiencing Jain’s work. ‘Yantra’ and ‘Tantra’, Jain’s most recent series of paintings, resemble dualities and opposing parts that exist within all of us. She refers to them as ‘yin and yang, the male and female’, which allow her to bring herself to the canvas, not in fragments but as a whole. On closer observation, viewers will notice extremely structured elements such as the grid and patterns from ‘Yantra’ in the ‘Tantra’ series and vice versa.While ‘Yantra’ deals with a systematic progression of the focused, logical, and structured mind that helps understand Jain’s layers of entering the state of samadhi; ‘Tantra’ takes on the same mind in its unleashed, challenged, and boundless form, flowing free. Yet, the breath returns to centre both series of paintings.Every line, dot and grid in ‘Yantra’ is representative of the inhalation and exhalation of the artist’s breath. The centre is clearly determined within the structure until, with a slow release, the breath is let go in ‘Tantra’. By adjusting to the openness of ‘Tantra’ and observing it with time, the breath gradually returns to point out symmetry and order even in its chaos. The tiny dashes of brushstrokes are measured lines of breath and every now and then one can spot a constellation forming only to disperse back into the flow of another order.At a time when everything in our world seems driven and controlled by technology, Jain’s works invoke a sense of surrender grounded in trust that comes with letting go of control to accept freedom. There is sustained mindfulness in this achievement from observing oneself through the breath and mind in the present moment in ‘The Quiet Interlude’. With this alignment of the mind and breath, there is a very conscious space that arises within the body of work and the human body. For a form to be defined, it requires space. It is only when there is distance that one begins to observe patterns, grids, and structures.On coming too close, the detail takes over but then pushes the viewer back to create a space that allows one to be absorbed into the painting’s entirety. It is in this act of emptying that we are nourished to the brim with a contemplative energy and light which brings with it contentment, peace and harmony.","Trishla jain’s dance of dots and dashes create a harmonious whole in her new show.

Keeping your customers satisfied is more of a survival strategy in Schedule 1 than a goal. The use of appropriate mixing formulae for the best Strains is crucial. Players are not allowed to become very comfortable in this drug simulator because when they do, their clients will become irate, which will cause the cash deposits to decrease even faster.Knowing how to combine ingredients in the right way for making the best strains to maximize profit is the secret formula.

A generous move of Travis Kelce for Kansas City youth sparks debate on social media

Poll What do you admire most about Travis Kelce’s game? His clutch performances His powerful catches

Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce is no stranger to giving back, but his latest act of philanthropy is grabbing headlines for more than just its price tag. The tight end recently donated a $3.3 million home to Foster Love, a nonprofit working to support homeless youth in Kansas City. While many have applauded the move as a heartfelt gesture, the internet has exploded with speculation — with some fans claiming pop sensation Taylor Swift may have quietly financed the generous donation.The donation comes on the heels of a tough Super Bowl loss, but Travis Kelce’s influence off the field remains as powerful as ever. With a $17.1 million annual contract and an estimated net worth of $90 million, he’s got the financial means to make a serious impact. Still, not everyone is convinced the donation was purely altruistic.The controversy kicked off when fans began questioning the true origin of the funds. Some social media users speculated that Taylor Swift, Travis Kelce’s high-profile girlfriend, may have contributed — or even footed the entire bill. Theories range from Swift subtly backing the donation to the couple strategically making philanthropic moves to boost their public image. “Some fans assume that the singer paid,” read one line in a Marca report, igniting even more online chatter.Still, those close to the athlete say this isn’t out of character for him. Kelce founded the Eighty-Seven & Running foundation in 2015, focusing on underserved youth in both Cleveland and Kansas City. In 2024 alone, he donated 25,000 meals to students in need — a far cry from a one-off publicity stunt.Many are calling the donation a “classy act” and a reflection of Kelce’s long-standing commitment to social good. Others, however, suggest the timing and optics are too calculated. Tax benefits have also entered the conversation, with critics speculating the move could be financially strategic.Also Read: “Bizarre visuals”: Taylor Swift emoji rumors spark chaos as viral tweet dupes iPhone users with fake Apple update Despite the noise, Kelce's track record speaks volumes. His involvement with programs like Operation Breakthrough and direct contributions to education initiatives underscore a history of impact. Whether motivated by love, strategy, or genuine goodwill, one thing is clear: lives in Kansas City will be changed for the better.","Travis kelce recently donated a $3.3 million home to foster love, a nonprofit working to support homeless youth in kansas city.

Peter Thiel bought a $13 million beaux-arts residence in 2021.

Similarly, former Google CEO Eric Schmidt acquired a $15 million Georgetown home once occupied by Jacqueline Kennedy.

PayPal co-founder David Sacks, now a White House advisor, purchased a $10.3 million Northwest DC penthouse.

Former eBay executive Jeff Skoll spent $17 million on Virginia properties reportedly planned for a compound.

Mark Zuckerberg has become the latest tech billionaire to establish a presence in Washington DC, purchasing a $23 million mansion in the upscale Woodland Normanstone neighborhood, a report has said. The acquisition, confirmed by Facebook parent company Meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.Politico reports that for weeks, the identity of the buyer remained shrouded in mystery as real estate agents were bound by non-disclosure agreements. Shortly after the cash transaction closed in early March, images of the 15,000-square-foot property became pixelated on Google Maps, the report added.Neighborhood residents noted increased activity at the previously vacant home, coinciding with reports that Zuckerberg’s private jet had landed at Dulles Airport.The publication says that a Meta spokesperson confirmed the purchase, explaining: “Mark and Priscilla have purchased a home in DC, which will allow Mark to spend more time there as Meta continues the work on policy issues related to American technology leadership.”The official explanation cites convenience and safety during increased Washington visits. Notably, Zuckerberg also has properties in Palo Alto, Lake Tahoe and Hawaii, among other places.Although tech titans have acquired Washington properties even before Trump's return to office, the pace has reportedly accelerated significantly in the past year.","The acquisition, confirmed by facebook parent company meta, represents the third-most expensive residential sale in the city's history.

Elon Musk: What did Elon Musk's DOGE do to Deloitte? 124 contracts worth more than $370 million slashed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/what-did-elon-musks-doge-do-to-deloitte-124-contracts-worth-more-than-370-million-slashed/articleshow/119989158.cms,"What did Elon Musk's DOGE do to Deloitte? 127 contracts worth $1.16 billion slashed

Deloitte has been hit hardest by the Trump administration’s consulting cuts , with at least 124 of its federal contracts eliminated or modified since January, Fortune reported.The cuts, led by Elon Musk ’s department of government efficiency ( DOGE ), aim to reduce government spending and have resulted in an estimated $371.8 million in taxpayer savings .According to Fortune, DOGE has cut or modified at least 124 Deloitte contracts since the start of Trump’s second term. These contracts were worth a total of over $1.16 billion, with terminations done worth over $371.8 million. The largest cancelled contract, valued at $51 million, was for IT services for the department of health and human services. Deloitte has faced more contract eliminations than any other consultancy, with Booz Allen Hamilton and Accenture trailing behind.DOGE claims to have saved $140 billion overall, but Bank of America has raised concerns over exaggerated savings, as some listed contract terminations predate Trump’s tenure or ended naturally, reported The New York Times.The cuts have impacted the private sector, as federal contracts are a major source of revenue for consulting firms. Accenture’s CEO Julie Sweet acknowledged in an earnings call that the reductions have hurt the firm’s revenue, with its Federal Services division losing $240.2 million in contracts. Following her remarks, Accenture’s stock dropped by more than 7%.The General Services Administration (GSA) has asked consultancies to submit detailed reports identifying cost-cutting opportunities. “This Administration is firmly of the view that America’s private industry is our backbone… but that’s not inconsistent with right-sizing spending,” said GSA’s Josh Gruenbaum, according to Fortune.While DOGE’s actions have largely spared the defense sector, companies like Booz Allen Hamilton, which rely heavily on Pentagon contracts, remain at risk. Analysts warn that prolonged cuts could impact innovation and economic growth, with firms taking a cautious “wait-and-see” approach.","Elon musk's department of government efficiency ( doge) has cut or modified at least 124 deloitte contracts since the start of trump's second term.

But were Meghan's products sold in minutes?



After many hiccups, Meghan Markle 's brand has taken off and how! Her 'As ever' products, including $28 wildflower honey, were sold out in less than five minutes after they went live, and this is the fresh nightmare of the Royal Family.According to experts, there are two sides to this 'nightmare'. One is backlash for Meghan that she probably hit the jackpot cashing in on her royal title despite quitting her royal duties. And the second is she has now become a money-making influencer -- heaping on her complaints against the Royal Family like she has been doing, but many people are likely to be influenced by her as her business success revived 2019's 'Meghan Effect' -- a belief that whatever Meghan touches turns to gold.Speaking on the Palace Confidential YouTube show, expert Richard Eden slammed the product line.""It went live yesterday with the prices and everything. It's really pathetic. There's only about ten items. I was expecting quite a nice range,"" Richard said.Referring to edible sprinkles, Richard said, ""What? $15, I think, for a tiny little tin?"" before Jo Elvin added, ""Well, according to Meghan, it's sold out.""""'Sold out'. I mean, give me a break. That's the oldest marketing trick in the book,"" Richard said.""What this represents is Meghan effectively cashing in on her fame … even using her children to try and boost her presence online and sell units of her products,"" Duncan Larcombe, former royal editor of The Sun, claimed to Fox. ""This is exactly what the royals feared would happen. … [But] it’ll take a few weeks before we really know whether she hit the jackpot.""""She might have struck gold, but I think the overwhelming view here is just more of her cashing in on her fame, based upon her association with the British royal family,"" Larcombe added. ""[But] she isn’t popular in the UK. And I can’t imagine that having a range of products like this is going to make any difference.""British broadcaster and photographer Helena Chard said it was bound to bring Meghan success as the products are affordable.

For Delhivery, the deal represents a strategic move to increase its scale and strengthen its competitive position in the fast-evolving logistics market.Sahil Barua, Managing Director and CEO of Delhivery, expressed confidence in the move, stating, “The Indian economy needs continuous improvements in logistics cost efficiency, speed, and reach. This acquisition will help us serve the customers of both companies better by making bold investments in infrastructure, technology, and our network.”Delhivery, with Rs 5,488 crore in cash and cash equivalents as of September 30, 2024, is well-positioned to finance the acquisition. The deal is still subject to approval from the Competition Commission of India (CCI) but is expected to close in the next six months. After the acquisition, Ecom Express will operate as a subsidiary of Delhivery.The deal marks the end of Ecom Express's IPO ambitions. The company had previously filed a draft prospectus in August 2024, seeking to raise Rs 1,284.5 crore in fresh capital while also offering Rs 1,315.5 crore in secondary stake sales. However, the deteriorating market conditions led to the postponement of these plans.In the lead-up to the acquisition, Ecom Express had already begun consolidating its operations, shutting down several delivery hubs, and laying off hundreds of employees. Delhivery had also raised concerns about Ecom Express's financial practices, accusing its rival of inflating its operational metrics, particularly by double-counting return-to-origin shipments, which inflated the company’s reported volumes.Ecom Express has faced further challenges following the death of its cofounder, T. A. Krishnan, in October 2023. Krishnan, who helped establish the company in 2012 and played a vital role in shaping India’s e-commerce logistics landscape, had stepped back from day-to-day operations over a year before his passing.","Delhivery has announced its acquisition of ecom express in an all-cash deal valued at rs 1,407 crore.

top $800bn in FY25

NEW DELHI: A last-minute scramble by companies to beat Donald Trump's reciprocal tariffs may have helped India come close to last year's goods exports level of $437 billion, senior officials said Saturday.Apple is said to have shipped five planeloads of iPhones and other products to the US over just three days to stock up its warehouses and ensure prices don't surge.In its edition on Saturday, TOI had reported that Apple had shipped an ""unusually high"" number of shipments from both India and China despite this being a lean season. The trend was seen in the case of other electronics products too. an official said.Also read: Stocked-up Apple buys time, may not pass on duties soon Gems and jewellery players also stepped up exports amid pressure from American buyers. Between April 1 and 4, gems and jewellery exports to the US through the precious cargo clearance system for customs in Mumbai soared nearly six-fold to $344 million, compared with $61 million in the same period last year. This was probably to beat the 10% tariffs that kicked in at midnight Saturday. Apparel shipments were similarly fast-tracked.India's goods and services exports are estimated to have topped $800 billion during the fiscal year ended March.India's goods exports had declined 3% in 2023-24 and cumulative exports had reached $778 billion. A few weeks ago, commerce and industry minister Piyush Goyal had nudged exporters to step up the flow of consignments during the last fortnight of the last fiscal year. The prod came after a 11% decline in exports during Feb, which was estimated at $36.9 billion, compared with $41.1 billion in Feb 2024.""There was a significant increase in exports during the last week of March,"" confirmed Kirit Bhansali, chairman of the Gems & Jewellery Export Promotion Council. Initial estimates suggested that gems and jewellery exports stayed flat at $1.7 billion in March.""There was an increase in sectors where it was possible to transport goods by air to the US. I am expecting exports of over $40 billion in March 2025,"" said Ajay Sahai, director general, Fieo. In March 2024, exports amounted to $41.6 billion. Trade data is due to be released on April 15.On its part, govt is seeking to target an increase in goods exports during the current financial year even as it believes that growth in services can be sustained as India enjoys a strong competitive advantage due to a vast skilled workforce across sectors. A senior govt official said lower oil prices would help manufacturers, while retailers in the US will reduce the high margin for several goods to offset the impact of high tariffs. Usually, there is a surge in external trade in March. Due to the tariff threat, there was a lot of uncertainty among businesses, an industry source said.With stocks in their warehouses, companies are hoping to reduce some of the blow for consumers although exporters said it may affect the volume of goods shipped during the first quarter of the current fiscal year. Exporters are hoping that over the next few months, uncertainty will also ease, putting trade back on track.",March bump may help india come close to last year's goods exports level of $437 billion.

This is a distress sale for Ecom Express, which was last valued at over $800 million.
