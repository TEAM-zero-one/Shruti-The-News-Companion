Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad among top biz destinations



Room boom

Faith rules, and so does Rishikesh when it comes to remaining the priciest desi destination in terms of average hotel room rates. Though business travel gathered steam last fiscal — Mumbai and Delhi knocked off Srinagar and Udaipur from the second and third spots — leisure was the buzz, with 10 out of top 15 on the list being non-business destinations.Leading hospitality consulting firm Hotelivate’s recent report for 2024-25 shows the holy town in Uttarakhand on top of the pile for the second consecutive year, though its revenue per available room (RevPAR) declined marginally by about 4% to Rs 9,691 from Rs 10,086 in FY 24.The top 10 leisure destinations are: Rishikesh, Ranthambore, Udaipur, Srinagar, Goa, Varanasi, Jodhpur, Mussoorie, Lonavala and Agra. The five business destinations are Mumbai, Delhi, Hyderabad, Gurgaon and Bengaluru. “In recent years, rising demand for leisure destinations, particularly emerging ones with limited supply, has propelled these locations to the top of the country’s RevPAR (revenue per available room) rankings. The broader top 15 reflects similar trends: leisure markets like Coorg and Srinagar have dropped in rank due to the arrival of new, lower-tier hotels, whereas established urban markets such as Hyderabad, and Gurgaon have posted robust RevPAR growth,” says Hotelivate.Indian hospitality industry was on a roll last fiscal thanks to a booming economy and domestic travel, even as international inbound continues below pre-Covid 2019 levels. The report says India’s proposed supply crossed the 1 lakh-room mark for the first time in over a decade and the average room occupancy in April 2024-March 2025 “stood at 68.0%, the highest in recent memory and comfortably above the pre-pandemic levels. ”The fallout of the Pahalgam terror attack, including impact on commercial flights both in India and international ones due to prolonged airspace closures, did affect travel. The overall travel industry remains confident of coming out of that and continue their best post-Covid success story seen last fiscal. “Despite turbulence — economic slowdowns, geopolitical headwinds, and investor caution — India has kept its pace strong. Domestic demand has been powering the industry forward, even when international arrivals remained inconsistent.” While leisure “markets found a rhythm, posting records in performance” last fiscal, places like Goa are “showing signs of fatigue.”“Mumbai secured pole position yet again, leading the country in room revenue per key and ranking on the podium in all other key metrics. Bengaluru and New Delhi complete the top three by inventory.” Existing hotels outperformed on both occupancy and rate last fiscal, but their strength tends to get diluted when averaged with newer supply. Properties operational before March 2021 saw an occupancy of 71.9% versus the overall average of 68%. And their average daily rate was Rs 8,701 compared to nationwide ADR of Rs 8,432.The proposed supply pipeline “reflects a bold strategy introducing branded hotels into 177 new markets.” As of March 2025, the total branded pipeline, regardless of construction status, stands at 1,14,151 rooms.","Mumbai, delhi, hyderabad among top biz destinations.

Elon Musk maintains lead over rivals as Larry Ellison briefly challenges his fortune

Tech entrepreneur Elon Musk has made history as the first person ever to surpass a net worth of $500 billion, highlighting his unrivaled influence in the global technology and business arena. This unprecedented milestone is driven largely by the soaring value of Tesla, his electric vehicle company, whose shares have surged due to strong sales, innovation, and investor confidence. Beyond Tesla, Musk’s wealth is bolstered by his space exploration venture SpaceX, which continues to secure contracts and expand its satellite operations, and his artificial intelligence startup xAI, which is gaining traction in the AI sector. Musk’s diversified portfolio, visionary leadership, and relentless focus on technological breakthroughs have positioned him as the world’s richest individual, reshaping industries along the way.On Wednesday afternoon, Forbes reported that Musk’s net worth briefly reached $500.1 billion before settling slightly above $499 billion later in the day. This exceptional wealth cements Musk’s position as the world’s richest person, significantly ahead of his closest competitors in the technology sector.The billionaire’s wealth is closely tied to his 12%+ stake in Tesla, which has experienced a remarkable surge in stock value over the past year. Tesla shares were up more than 3.3% at the end of trading on Wednesday and have risen over 20% year-to-date, reflecting growing investor confidence in Musk’s leadership and strategic vision. While Tesla remains the cornerstone of Musk’s fortune, his other ventures have contributed substantially to his net worth. The space exploration company SpaceX has seen increased valuation due to ongoing satellite and launch contracts, while his AI-focused startup, xAI, has gained attention in the tech world for cutting-edge developments.Recent months have also seen Musk redirecting his focus toward business rather than politics, a move that investors have welcomed. This strategic pivot is seen as a key factor behind Tesla’s stock gains and the corresponding growth of his personal wealth.According to Forbes’ billionaires index, Oracle founder Larry Ellison holds the second spot globally with a fortune of roughly $350.7 billion. Ellison briefly overtook Musk last month after Oracle shares jumped more than 40%, driven by positive forecasts for its cloud infrastructure, AI initiatives, and enterprise software growth.Despite occasional competition from rivals, Musk’s diversified portfolio, including Tesla, SpaceX, and other innovative ventures, and his leadership across multiple high-growth sectors have reinforced his long-term wealth trajectory, placing him comfortably ahead in the billionaire rankings and maintaining his influence in global business and technology markets.Musk’s influence at Tesla is now more pronounced than ever. In September 2025, Tesla board chair Robyn Denholm highlighted that Musk is “front and centre” in guiding the company’s strategy.Tesla’s board has also approved a potential pay package exceeding $1 trillion for Musk, contingent upon achieving highly ambitious targets over the next decade. These goals include boosting Tesla’s valuation eightfold, selling one million AI robots, delivering 12 million additional Tesla cars, and reaching several other business milestones.Musk’s recent $1 billion purchase of Tesla shares has been interpreted by investors as a strong vote of confidence in the company’s future prospects.Tesla has faced multiple challenges in recent years, including intensified competition from global electric vehicle makers such as China’s BYD. However, Musk continues to diversify Tesla’s portfolio, transitioning the company into AI and robotics, and expanding into digital currencies and other emerging technologies.Musk is also known for his outspoken views on social and political issues, including immigration and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. While he faced criticism earlier this year over his involvement with the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), he has consistently emphasized that his business pursuits are driven by societal and technological impact rather than personal profit.Musk’s relentless work ethic and focus on transformative projects have become hallmarks of his career. As Tesla investor Ross Gerber notes, “Elon only involves himself with things he believes are important for society or humanity,” a principle that underscores his broader mission beyond financial gain. By combining innovation across electric vehicles, space exploration, AI, and digital technologies, Musk has not only become the first half-trillionaire but has also reshaped the global technology landscape, inspiring entrepreneurs worldwide.","Elon musk has made history as the first person ever to surpass a net worth of $500 billion.

Here's CEO Satya Nadella's email to Microsoft employees on the restructuring:

We are in the midst of a tectonic AI platform shift, one that requires us to both manage and grow our at-scale commercial business today, while building the new frontier and executing flawlessly across both.

An image of Judson Althoff, chief executive officer of the commercial business at Microsoft.

History shows that general purpose technologies like AI drive step changes in productivity and GDP growth, and we have a unique opportunity to help our customers and the world realize this promise.

Our success depends on enabling commercial and public sector customers and partners to combine their human capital with new AI capabilities to change the frontier of how they operate. To accelerate this, we will increasingly need to bring together sales, marketing, operations, and engineering to drive growth and strengthen our position as the partner of choice for AI transformation.

With this context, I have asked Judson Althoff to take on an expanded role as CEO of our commercial business. Over the past nine years, Judson has led our global sales organization and was the architect behind designing and building Microsoft Customer and Partner Solutions (MCAPS) into what it is today: the “number one seed” in the industry and our company’s most important growth engine.

Takeshi Numoto and his marketing team will join this new organization, with Takeshi reporting directly to Judson as CMO, while also continuing to report directly to me on all-up business models, planning, consumer marketing, and corporate brand and communications.

Our operations organization will also move to report to Judson. By bringing operations into the commercial business, we can tighten the feedback loop between what customers need and how we deliver and support them. Carolina Dybeck Happe will continue to report to me, as she works on our overall company transformation and continues to closely partner with Judson.

Additionally, Judson will lead a new commercial leadership team that brings together leaders from engineering, sales, marketing, operations, and finance to drive our product strategy and governance, GTM readiness, and sales motions with shared accountability for the rigor and executional excellence our customers expect.

This will also allow our engineering leaders and me to be laser focused on our highest ambition technical work—across our datacenter buildout, systems architecture, AI science, and product innovation—to lead with intensity and pace in this generational platform shift. Each one of us needs to be at our very best in terms of rapidly learning new skills, adopting new ways to work, and staying close to the metal to drive innovation across the entire stack!!

This isn’t just evolution, it’s reinvention, for each of us professionally and for Microsoft.

Satya

How Pavel Durov became Dubai's richest





In a country where royal families and oil tycoons dominate the wealth landscape, the richest man in Dubai is a tech billionaire. Meet Telegram CEO Pavel Durov who is the richest man in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with a net worth of over $17 billion, according to Forbes Billionaires list. Durov is followed by Hussain Sajwani – chairman of Dubai-based luxury real estate developer Damac Properties, with a net worth of $10.2 billion. Globally, Pavel Durov ranks at number 118 in the Forbes global list. His rise reflects not only the global reach of his messaging app but also Dubai’s growing status as a hub for technology and innovation.Born in St. Petersburg in 1984, Pavel Durov is often referred to as “Mark Zuckerberg of Russia”. Durov first made his name by co-founding VKontakte, Russia’s largest social network. But after clashes with authorities, he sold his stake and left the country in 2014. That same year, he shifted focus to Telegram, which has since exploded into a global platform with over 1 billion monthly active users worldwide.Durov left Russia after refusing to cooperate with the secret service and provide encrypted data of his first social network's users.Telegram was banned in Russia from 2018 to 2021.In 2018 Pavel, with his brother Nikolai, raised $1.7 billion from investors to create TON, a blockchain system; it was shut down after the SEC banned it.Pavel Durov became a French citizen in 2021 but lives in Dubai. As per information available on Forbes billionaires website, he has five children that he shares with two ex-girlfriends. In the past, Durov has claimed to have donated sperm that led to him fathering 100 children.Durov relocated to Dubai, where Telegram is now headquartered. He later acquired UAE citizenship in February 2021.Relocating to Dubai gave Durov not only a strategic base for expansion but also UAE citizenship, placing him in a unique spot among the country’s wealthiest. Though Telegram app remains free to use, Durov introduced Telegram Premium in 2022, offering paid features to power users. This, combined with the platform’s high valuation, cemented his billionaire status.","Telegram ceo pavel durov is the richest man in the united arab emirates (uae) with a net worth of over $17 billion, according to forbes billionaires list.

There are questions about where Zoho is developed and where the data is hosted and who hosts it. There is a lot of false information we want to correct.

Poll Should companies clarify the data storage and hosting practices to the public? Yes, it's critical. No, it's not necessary.

1. All the products are developed in India. Our

global headquarters

is in Chennai and we pay taxes in India on our global income. As a global corporation headquartered in India, we have offices in over 80 countries and have a strong presence in the US which is a big market for us.

2. Indian customer data is hosted in India (Mumbai, Delhi and Chennai, soon Odissa). We have over 18 data centers globally and they host the respective country or regional data. We are committed to hosting each country data in their own jurisdiction.

3. All our services run on hardware we own and software frameworks we developed, on top of open source like

Linux

OS and Postgres database.

4. We do not host our products on AWS or Azure. Arattai, specifically, is not hosted on AWS or Azure or GCloud. We use some of those services for regional switching nodes to speed up traffic but data is not stored in them. We are adding many such ""points of presence"" (POPs) as we speak.

5. Our Zoho Developer account in the App Store and Play Store lists our US office address because the account was registered in the very early days of those stores by one of our employees in the US just to test them out. We never changed that.

We are proudly ""Made in India, Made for the World"" and we mean it.

Paramount to buy Free Press: Who is Bari Weiss? Rebel journalist set to become editor-in chief of CBS News,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/paramount-to-buy-free-press-who-is-bari-weiss-rebel-journalist-set-to-become-editor-in-chief-of-cbs-news/articleshow/124284561.cms,"Who is Weiss?







Paramount Skydance is set to appoint Bari Weiss as editor in chief of CBS News in the coming days, providing the journalist with significant authority to overhaul the network as it acquires her independent news site, the Free Press, The Post has learned.Weiss, a 41-year-old former New York Times opinion writer who developed the Free Press into a prominent platform with a contrarian perspective, is expected to be named to the top position in a Monday announcement. However, negotiations remain uncertain, and the timeline may change, a source close to the matter stated.In a notable restructuring of CBS News’ longstanding management framework, Weiss will report directly to Paramount Skydance Chief Executive David Ellison as she assists in defining the editorial direction of the Tiffany Network’s third-largest news division, a source indicated.Weiss’s direct reporting line to Ellison means she will not answer to CBS News President Tom Cibrowski, who currently reports to George Cheeks, Chair of TV Media at Paramount Skydance.Insiders mentioned that Weiss’s hiring raises doubts about the potential return of former CBS President David Rhodes to the network, with one source describing their job prospects as an “either/or” scenario.Sources informed The Post that Weiss could serve as a strong counterpart to Cibrowski, a former “Good Morning America” executive who is viewed more as a production expert than a journalist.Others anticipate that it will soon be clear whether Weiss—who has become a leading voice against antisemitism and the “woke” elites in mainstream media—will challenge Cibrowski’s position.Weiss, 40, made her name as a sharp-tongued opinion columnist at The New York Times. Her pieces took aim at the MeToo movement, campus activism, and what she described as “illiberalism on the left.”In 2020, she quit in spectacular fashion, publishing a viral resignation letter accusing the paper of silencing ideological diversity.She then launched The Free Press in 2022, billing it as “fiercely independent.”The outlet quickly drew attention, and controversy, with stories that platformed conservative voices, a friendly sit-down with venture capitalist Peter Thiel, and essays that critics said downplayed the famine in Gaza.","Bari weiss, a former new york times opinion writer, is expected to be named to the top position in a monday announcement.

Poll Do you believe the Taliban's suspension of internet services is justified? Yes, to prevent immorality No, it's an infringement on rights





The Taliban government in Afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service, following weeks of cutting fibre-optic internet connections in different provinces.According to internet watchdog NetBlocks, the country is experiencing a ""total internet blackout."" The group reported that the disruption appears to be the most extensive and coordinated shutdown of telecom services in Afghanistan since the Taliban regained control in 2021. The blackout has raised concerns about the return of earlier restrictions from the Taliban’s first rule, when they banned television, satellite dishes, and other forms of mass communication in what they described as a campaign against immorality.The government had already started reducing high-speed internet access in some provinces earlier this month. Officials said this was done to prevent ""vice,"" following orders from the Taliban’s supreme leader, Hibatullah Akhundzada.By Monday night, mobile phone signals and internet access steadily weakened across the country until overall connectivity dropped to less than one percent of normal activity, NetBlocks reported.It is the first time since the Taliban seized power in 2021, after years of insurgency, that communication services across the nation have been cut off. Since then, the group has enforced a strict version of Islamic law and imposed several restrictions.Residents expressed concern over the impact of the blackout on daily life and business. ""We are blind without phones and internet,"" Najibullah, a 42-year-old shopkeeper in Kabul, was quoted as saying by the news agency AFP. ""All our business relies on mobiles. The deliveries are with mobiles. It's like a holiday, everyone is at home. The market is totally frozen.""The Taliban have not issued an official explanation for the nationwide suspension. A government official, however, said that “eight to nine thousand telecommunications pillars” would be switched off and added that the blackout would remain in place “until further notice.”Just last year, in 2024, the Taliban had described Afghanistan’s fibre-optic project as a key priority. The 9,350-kilometre (5,800-mile) network, developed mostly during governments backed by the United States, was promoted as a way to connect the country with the outside world and support economic recovery.Earlier in September, Taliban representatives warned that they planned to cut off internet access nationwide “to prevent immoral activities.” They did not specify what was considered immoral under their order.Haji Zaid, the governor of Balkh province, said in a statement that ""an alternative system will be established within the country for essential needs."" He did not clarify what this system would include or how it would function.","The taliban government in afghanistan has ordered a nationwide suspension of internet and mobile phone service.

How Indian nationals are snapping up British buy-to-lets,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/how-indian-nationals-are-snapping-up-british-buy-to-lets/articleshow/124261789.cms,"TOI Correspondent from London:





Indian nationals are the largest non-UK shareholders of buy-to-let companies in Britain this year, according to analysis by estate agency Hamptons.Analysis of data by Hamptons shows that Indian investors are followed by Nigerians, Poles and Irish. Indians have made up the largest group since 2023; in 2022, they were the second-largest.In the first half of this year, Indian nationals founded 684 new buy-to-let companies, with more registered in Hillingdon than in any other area. Nigerian investors follow closely with 647 new incorporations. This shift reflects wider post-Brexit migration patterns.Buy-to-let companies are special-purpose companies set up to buy and manage residential rental properties.EU nationals now account for 49% of non-UK shareholders, down from 65% in 2016. There has been a general fall in shareholders from the Anglosphere, too. In 2016, Irish, Americans, South Africans and Australians all featured in the top 10. By 2025, only Irish nationals remained, ranking fourth. Instead, Indian and Nigerian investors are stepping into the spotlight, despite rents falling this year for the first time in five years.There were approximately 127,000 more Nigerian nationals and 178,000 more Indian nationals immigrating to the UK in 2023 compared with 2019, according to the Office of National Statistics.Twenty per cent of buy-to-let companies set up in the UK so far this year are owned by non-UK national shareholders, up from 13% in 2016. The remaining 80% are owned by UK shareholders. Seven per cent of Indian nationals who own UK buy-to-let companies set up over the past decade live in India.At current rates, around 67,000 new companies will be set up by the end of 2025, with around 13,500 owned, at least in part, by non-UK nationals. Companies are a more tax-efficient way of managing rental properties in Britain.Whilst London has always been an attractive investment choice for foreign landlords, between 2016 and 2025 the share of new non-UK national landlords has more than doubled in the East Midlands, West Midlands and Scotland.Aneisha Beveridge, head of research at Hamptons, said: “While overseas-based investors are part of the picture, the majority of purchases by non-UK nationals reflect domestic demand. Up until 2021, this demand was most likely to come from EU nationals based in the UK, but since then it has shifted to reflect changes in broader migration patterns. Indian and Nigerian nationals are increasingly likely to buy UK buy-to-let property in a limited company structure. ”","Analysis of data by hamptons shows that indian investors are followed by nigerians, poles and irish.

UAE: Dubai to roll out over 200 ultra-fast EV charging stations for taxis starting this year,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-dubai-to-roll-out-over-200-ultra-fast-ev-charging-stations-for-taxis-starting-thisyear/articleshow/124295417.cms,"Dubai launches 208 ultra-fast EV chargers for taxis and EVs, cutting costs, charging time, and boosting green mobility /AI Representative Image, for illustrative purposes only

How Dubai’s EV chargers will cut carbon emissions



Dubai taxi fleet electrification: Faster charging for drivers and riders

How this fits Dubai’s bigger EV plan





Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) and Dubai Taxi Company (DTC) have signed a long-term contract to roll out 208 ultra-fast EV charging points across the emirate - a move aimed at speeding up taxi fleet electrification and cutting transport emissions. The deal was signed at WETEX 2025 and is part of DEWA’s EV Green Charger program.The first phase will launch two main charging hubs: DTC’s depot near Dubai International Airport and DTC’s headquarters in Muhaisnah 4. The stations will include next-generation chargers with capacities up to 360 kW, designed to serve the growing electric taxi fleet and support fast turnaround times for vehicles. The rollout of 208 points will take place over the contract period and aligns with DTC’s broader fleet transformation plans.Dubai’s new ultra-fast EV charging stations will officially begin rolling out in late 2025, with the first two major hubs operational near Dubai International Airport (DTC depot) and Muhaisnah 4 (DTC headquarters). The full network of 208 charging points is expected to be gradually completed over the next 12–18 months, ensuring wider coverage for taxi fleets and public EV users.For drivers, the charging service is designed to be affordable and convenient.DEWA has confirmed that pricing will follow standard EV Green Charger tariffs, with potential special rates for fleet operators like Dubai Taxi Company to support the transition to electric vehicles. Drivers can pay using DEWA’s mobile app, smart cards, or contactless payment methods at each station, making the process seamless Access is straightforward: taxi operators and individual EV owners can register through the DEWA EV Green Charger portal or app, select the nearest available charger, and start charging immediately once registered. The ultra-fast chargers, with capacities up to 360 kW, can significantly reduce charging times, allowing taxis to return to service in under 30 minutes at high-power stations.This rollout ensures that drivers face minimal downtime, can plan routes efficiently around charging points, and benefit from a growing, reliable EV infrastructure. With careful planning, fleet operators can optimize schedules and reduce operational costs while contributing to Dubai’s green mobility and carbon reduction goals.DEWA and DTC estimate the initial phase will reduce about 37,939 metric tonnes of CO₂ annually; when combined with DTC’s existing chargers, annual savings could reach around 49,654 tonnes. This contribution supports Dubai’s Green Mobility Strategy 2030 and the UAE’s Net Zero 2050 goals. The project is explicitly framed as a climate-action step as much as an infrastructure upgrade.DTC aims to electrify its entire fleet of taxis and limousines by 2040, with the EV fleet expected to surpass 2,500 vehicles by 2030. Ultra-fast chargers (up to 360 kW) will shorten charging windows and improve operational efficiency for drivers, helping taxis return to service faster. This contract complements other private-sector rollouts in Dubai designed to cut charge times to “under 30 minutes” at many ultra-fast sites. Together, these moves make daily EV operations more practical for commercial fleets and drivers.DEWA’s EV Green Charger initiative, launched in 2014, already supports 1,500+ charging points across Dubai; the new DTC agreement adds capacity targeted at fleet needs while strengthening the public charging ecosystem. Other recent projects (private and public) aim to install hundreds more ultra-fast points across high-traffic locations, retail hubs, residential clusters and transport nodes over the next 12–24 months. This layered approach (fleet hubs + public ultra-fast sites) is intended to reduce range anxiety and accelerate EV adoption citywide.DEWA–DTC deal is a practical step to electrify Dubai’s transport layer: it pairs high-power chargers with clear fleet targets and measurable carbon savings. For drivers, fleet operators and residents this means cleaner rides, shorter charging waits and a faster path to a greener city.","Dubai electricity and water authority (dewa) and dubai taxi company (dtc) have signed a long-term contract to roll out 208 ultra-fast ev charging points across the emirate.

'Coordinated campaign' against health and sustainability findings



Social media, AI helping to spread misinformation



Taking back the 'emotional narrative'







A healthy diet, for people and the planet, would include a more varied menu of nut and legumes, whole grains and plenty of fruits and vegetables, with significantly less meat, dairy products and sugar.That's the relatively straightforward message from the EAT-Lancet Commission, an independent scientific body working with the influential British medical journal. On Friday, it presented a major update to its 2019 report on healthy diets that are also good for the environment, findings which have been widely accepted by global health and environmental experts.""Food systems generate roughly 30% of global greenhouse gas emissions,"" said Johan Rockström, commission co-chair and director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, speaking in a media briefing earlier this week.Rockström outlined new research from more than 35 countries and six continents showing that including healthy foods in dietary guidelines, tackling food loss and waste, choosing local products and shifting to sustainable agricultural practices could reduce stress on the environment and cut those emissions by more than half and prevent up to 15 million premature deaths every year.""By uniting the latest science on health and climate, it shows that what we put on our plates can save millions of lives, cut billions of tons of emissions, halt the loss of biodiversity and create a fairer food system,"" he said.Despite widespread acceptance of this ""planetary health diet"", the commission's first report in 2019 has been cited more than 10,000 times, that message hasn't gone over well in online communities devoted to boosting meat-centered diets as natural, essential and environmentally friendly.The original report faced a torrent of misinformation on social media, misleading or biased content that disparaged the findings. Climate-focused reporting platform DeSmog wrote in April that it had seen a document appearing to trace the backlash to global PR consultancy Red Flag, which represents the meat and dairy industry. DW contacted Red Flag for comment, but the agency did not respond before publication.""Food is something people connect with,"" said Maddy Haughton-Boakes, a senior campaigner at Changing Markets Foundation, a Dutch NGO working to support solutions that benefit society and the environment. ""Everybody has a very personal connection with food and what we eat, and people know that. And if you play to that individualism agenda, you can really rile people up and motivate people.""A new investigation by Changing Markets lays out how ""industry-friendly scientists, doctors, health influencers, journalists and authors"" connected with the meat industry took part in a ""targeted and coordinated campaign"" to derail the 2019 EAT-Lancet report and its health and sustainability research, with critics portraying it as being ""dangerous, elitist and anti-science.""""At the time, a lot of the backlash was presented as organic,"" Haughton-Boakes told DW. ""We know now that it wasn't organic.""She said their research showed how ""mis-influencers"" tagged and shared each other's content, using similar or identical wording and hashtags like #Yes2Meat, #MeatHeals #ClimateFoodFacts to tout the health and environmental benefits of meat. And, she added, amid the current geopolitical instability and soaring food prices, there have been signs in recent days that this latest report will face the same resistance.The Changing Markets investigation said many of the people behind the 2019 campaign ""are still active and engaging with each other, their reach has grown and the public acceptance or take-up of their ideas has increased.""""The promotion of carnivore diets has shifted into the mainstream now,"" said Haughton-Boakes, highlighting the influence of manosphere podcasts and the ""Make America Healthy Again"" movement in the US under President Donald Trump. ""Globally, there's this protein boom and idea that you have to consume vast amounts of meat [and] animal protein for your health.""Haughton-Boakes said the weakening of fact-checking units and safeguards against misleading information on social media services such as X, Instagram and Facebook over the last year have helped fuel misinformation. As has the rise of AI tools boosting the spread of fake news and convincing deepfake videos and images.Writing for the Paris-based geopolitical studies group, sociologist Jose Henrique Bortoluci and Emmanuel Guerin, a fellow at the European Climate Foundation, said the relative freedom of social media has fostered an environment in which climate disinformation has flourished.""Opportunistic individuals take advantage of this environment to generate skepticism and spread misinformation. They have mastered the art of imitating 'expertise' or undermining it, exemplified by the rise of pseudo-experts and think tanks aimed at discrediting climate science,"" they wrote in July.In an email to DW, Bortoluci stressed that social media platforms need to be regulated, as with broadcast media and advertising.""There is no individual or institutional effort that can limit the spread of fake news and the advancement of disinformation campaigns if the platforms themselves are not co-responsible in tackling the problem,"" he said.""We all in the [EAT-Lancet] Commission share the same concern over this return… of mis- and disinformation, and denialism on climate science,"" Rockström told reporters earlier this week, in response to a DW question. But he felt the new report was ready to ""meet that assault"" with its ""rigorous"" global scientific assessment.""We're not dictating any specific one-fit-for-all type of diet,"" he added, pushing back against a common misinterpretation of the 2019 EAT-Lancet report.Walter C. Willett, professor of epidemiology and nutrition at Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in Boston, pointed out that the planetary health diet was similar to many traditional diets around the world.Examples of this healthy meal plan will be displayed on the report website in a series of pictures, he said, an apparent effort to connect with people and take back what Bortoluci and Guerin called the ""emotional narrative"" highjacked by misinformation.""[The pictures] make the case that this is not a deprivation diet that we're talking about,"" said Willett. ""This is something that could be delicious, aspirational and healthy.""","'coordinated campaign' against health and sustainability findings by meat industry.

How the Hajj accommodation licensing process works





Register via the Nusuk Masar platform, the centralized system for pilgrim service coordination.

Apply through the Ministry of Tourism’s electronic platform at https://tlg.mt.gov.sa/, ensuring all requirements are met.

Goals and benefits of the seasonal licensing model for Hajj





Improve service quality by enforcing seasonal standards that must be met by all participating accommodations.

Increase accommodation capacity during the peak Hajj period through regulated, short-term approvals.

Integrate licensed properties with the Nusuk platform, allowing for centralized and organized booking management.

Ensure safety and compliance through the use of official electronic verification and registration systems.

Coordination between ministries





The Ministry of Hajj and Umrah, overseeing the spiritual and logistical aspects of the pilgrimage.

The Ministry of Tourism, responsible for regulating hospitality services.

The Ministry of Municipalities and Housing, contributing to urban planning and infrastructure readiness.





To streamline the accommodation process for Hajj 2026, Saudi Arabia has rolled out a seasonal licensing system for pilgrim housing in Makkah and Madinah. The initiative, developed through inter-ministerial collaboration, focuses on enhancing service standards, ensuring compliance, and organizing bookings through official digital platforms.The Ministry of Hajj and Umrah has formally introduced a temporary hostel licensing service for accommodations specifically catering to pilgrims in Makkah and Madinah during the Hajj season of 1447 AH (2026). This seasonal licensing model has been jointly developed with two other government bodies, the Ministry of Tourism and the Ministry of Municipalities and Housing — in a coordinated and streamlined effort to manage the large influx of pilgrims more effectively.Unlike permanent hotel licenses, this new initiative targets properties seeking short-term regulatory approval specifically for the Hajj period. Existing hotel establishments with active, year-round licenses issued officially by the Ministry of Tourism are exempt from this seasonal licensing process entirely.To obtain a license under the new system, applicants must complete two steps:The deadline for securing the necessary license is 13th Sha'ban 1447 AH, corresponding to February 1, 2026.All licenses must be finalized before this contracting period closes. No applications will be accepted beyond this date.The temporary hostel licensing system has been introduced to:By creating a standardized process and tying it to official digital infrastructure, the authorities aim to deliver a smoother, more reliable lodging experience for pilgrims.This licensing overhaul reflects a high level of coordination between:Together, these entities have designed a system that balances religious, administrative, and tourism-related requirements, making it easier for property owners and service providers to align with national Hajj goals.",Saudi arabia’s new hajj 2026 licensing system requires pilgrim accommodations to register via nusuk masar platform.
