Sanchar Saathi App Row In LS: Cong Flags Privacy Fears, Scindia Says 'Snooping Not Possible'

NEW DELHI: A new controversy seems to be building up over discussions within govt for satellite-assisted location tracking of mobile phone users for the needs of law enforcement agencies and disaster management officials.The matter, which has been in discussion for over five years now, had seen a suggestion by the mobile phone operators lobby, Cellular Operators Association of India (COAI), that govt order compulsory activation of A-GPS technology. This uses satellite and mobile data to give accurate and accelerated location of an individual. However, no action has been taken on the matter by the ministry of electronics and IT (Meity), which had been conducting talks with the industry — both mobile operators as well as device makers. Currently, phone operators provide location of individuals by tracking users through mobile towers, which lack pinpoint accuracy, while also being delayed in giving the coordinates.Sources said not much progress had been made in five years around implementation over issues related to user privacy as well as reluctance of device makers such as Apple and Samsung over mandated activation. The device makers argue that user consent needs to be taken before activation of pinpoint satellite-based location tracking.Also, they have expressed fears that other service providers, and even hackers, may misuse the always-on location tracking services, violating user privacy.The issue has come to the fore at a time when govt rescinded on a plan to mandate pre-installation of Sanchar Saathi app after outcry over possible state surveillance as well as user privacy violations. In this case too, global manufacturers such as Apple and Samsung had told the department of telecom — which had issued the pre-installation order — of their objections to the measure, citing user privacy.","The matter has been in discussion for over five years now.

IIT-Bombay steps into future with its own AI firm,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iit-bombay-steps-into-future-with-its-own-ai-firm/articleshow/125821723.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: The Indian Institute of Technology Bombay, long seen as a launchpad for India's brightest startups, has quietly crossed an even more telling milestone. It incorporated a company of its own. This is not an incubated spinoff or a faculty-seeded venture, but an organisation owned and anchored by IIT Bombay itself.On Nov 7, 2025, BharatGen Technology Foundation was registered with the Registrar of Companies in Mumbai, carrying the Powai institution's address as its own-an unmistakable signal of how India's top engineering school plans to shape the future of artificial intelligence.BharatGen, the country's first attempt to build a Large Language Model that mirrors India's linguistic, cultural, and social diversity, first took shape last year after the Department of Science and Technology (DST) laid the groundwork with Rs 235 crore in initial support, signalling an early bet on public infrastructure for AI.The project is supported under the DST's National Mission on Interdisciplinary Cyber-Physical Systems (NM-ICPS). Led by IIT Bombay, the BharatGen consortium brings together several leading institutions, including IIT Madras, IIT Kanpur, IIIT Hyderabad, IIT Mandi, IIT Hyderabad, IIM Indore, IIT Kharagpur, and IIIT Delhi.""To take the models from the lab to market requires the functional freedom and autonomy of a corporation as opposed to being just an academic project,"" said Prof Ganesh Ramakrishnan, IIT Bombay's professor who is the founder director of BharatGen Technology Foundation Designed to work across more than 22 Indian languages, BharatGen combines text, speech, and document vision, so AI can interpret information the way citizens naturally speak, read, or interact.BharatGen's ambition is not just to build large language models, but to build ones that sound and think like India. Its strength, said Prof Ramakrishna, lies in training systems on home-grown datasets and Indian languages-an approach he believes will make them far more dependable in real-world use.He added that the foundation plans to release distilled versions of its models to developers, allowing startups and enterprises to plug into sovereign AI without the cost or expertise of training colossal systems on their own. In other words, hesaid, BharatGen will do the heavy lifting so the country's innovators can get straight to building.The initiative has now received an additional Rs 1,058 crore from MeitY under the IndiaAI Mission, expanding BharatGen into a national sovereign AI effort.","Bharatgen is the country's first attempt to build a large language model that mirrors india's linguistic, cultural, and social diversity.

The Richest Players in NFL History Will Shock You

Aaron Rodgers – 200 million dollars

Kirk Cousins – about 180 million dollars

Russell Wilson – 165 million dollars

Matthew Stafford – 150 million dollars

The NFL has grown into a financial powerhouse where players turn their on-field success into long-term business wins. Many stars earn far beyond their salaries through smart investments, brand deals, and ventures that keep paying even after retirement. Their financial journeys show how discipline, strategy, and timing can redefine an athlete’s legacy.This list dives straight into the league’s wealthiest names and how they built their fortunes. From record-setting quarterbacks to players who mastered the business world early, each story proves that money in football comes from far more than trophies. These athletes combined talent with opportunity and turned their careers into thriving financial empires.Tom Brady may have retired in 2023, but his financial reach continues to grow. Celebrity Net Worth places him at 300 million dollars, a figure built on decades of elite play and smart business decisions. In 2022 alone, he earned 75 million dollars from salary and endorsements with Aston Martin, Under Armour, and TAG Heuer. After leading the New England Patriots for 19 seasons and winning a seventh Super Bowl with Tampa Bay, he expanded his empire through a deal with Fox Sports and his wellness company TB12.Brady’s choices show how a player can turn fame into a long-term business platform.Aaron Rodgers remains one of the most accomplished quarterbacks in the NFL and one of its sharpest earners. Celebrity Net Worth estimates his wealth at 200 million dollars. His three-year, 150 million dollar extension with the Green Bay Packers in 2022 made him the highest-paid quarterback at that time. He later signed a one-year deal with the Pittsburgh Steelers in 2025 worth an estimated 10 million dollars. Aaron Rodgers boosts his income with partnerships that include State Farm, Adidas, Pizza Hut, and Bose. He also invests in tech startups and real estate and is a minority owner of the Milwaukee Bucks.Minnesota Vikings quarterback Kirk Cousins built his fortune through consistent play and a focus on guaranteed money. Celebrity Net Worth places him near 180 million dollars. His steady rise comes from major contracts, brand deals like Tostitos, and smart investments. One source noted, “Cousins has had large guaranteed contracts, and endorsement deals.” His approach matches his own words: “I’m going to keep my head down and just keep working — that’s how I control my outcome. ” Kirk Cousins may not generate as many headlines as others, but his financial discipline makes him one of the league’s strongest earners.Russell Wilson signed a one-year, 10.5 million dollar deal with the New York Giants in 2025, but his largest payday came from a five-year, 245 million dollar contract with the Denver Broncos in 2022. Celebrity Net Worth estimates him at 165 million dollars. His endorsements include Nike, Bose, Amazon, and Mercedes-Benz. Wilson also invests actively, holding stakes in Seattle Sounders FC and his own clothing brand, Good Man Brand. Alongside his wife Ciara, he supports education and health initiatives through the Why Not You Foundation.Matthew Stafford helped deliver a Super Bowl win for the Los Angeles Rams in 2022 and strengthened his financial standing with a 160 million dollar contract extension the same year.

Gisele Bündchen finds more freedom with Joaquim Valente after years in Tom Brady’s shadow,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/gisele-bndchen-finds-more-freedom-with-joaquim-valente-after-years-in-tom-bradys-shadow/articleshow/125816698.cms,"Gisele Bündchen is reportedly feeling more like herself after her divorce from Tom Brady, embracing a quieter life focused on family and personal growth. Her new relationship with jiu-jitsu trainer Joaquim Valente offers her independence and emotional fulfillment, allowing her to step out of the spotlight she once shared with a global sports icon.

Why reports claim Gisele “feels freer” with Joaquim and how Tom Brady reacted to her new life

Gisele Bündchen has spent nearly two decades in the public eye as one of the most recognized supermodels in the world, but she has also lived many of those years under intense scrutiny as the wife of NFL icon Tom Brady. After their 2022 divorce, she chose a quieter chapter, focusing on family, healing and personal growth.Now, with her relationship with jiu-jitsu trainer Joaquim Valente flourishing and the arrival of their first child together, a new report claims Gisele feels more like herself than she has in years. According to insiders, her new romance isn’t just about love; it’s about finally stepping out of the spotlight she once shared with one of sports’ biggest names.According to Page Six, the Brazilian model “felt like she lived in his shadow for a long time” during her marriage to Brady. While she has often praised their time together and is “grateful for what she had” with the retired quarterback, sources claim her life now is more independent and emotionally fulfilling. Her relationship with Joaquim reportedly allows her to slow down, live more privately, and focus more deeply on family without the pressures of being attached to a global sports brand.Gisele and Joaquim quietly began dating in 2023, choosing intimacy over publicity.The pair welcomed a son in February 2025, marking Gisele’s third child and Valente’s first. Insiders say she is “absolutely loving this new chapter” and is excited about the future.Even though she has moved on, her relationship with Brady remains respectful, with both co-parenting their children, Benjamin and Vivian. Reports also suggest Brady was initially shocked to learn Gisele was expecting a child with Joaquim. As one source noted, “It just wasn’t something that was on his radar.”Despite the surprise, more recent speculation hints that Brady has offered congratulations and may even be rekindling a past romance with Irina Shayk. While those rumors remain unconfirmed, the overall tone suggests both families are learning how to navigate life after marriage.For Gisele, that journey seems rooted in a newfound ease, one defined not by fame or football, but by balance, privacy and love on her own terms.Also Read: “Not what I dreamed of”: Gisele Bündchen reflects on her marriage to Tom Brady with honesty and acceptance years after their split","Gisele bündchen is reportedly feeling more like herself after her divorce from tom brady.

"Alan Dye: Meta hires longtime Apple design VP Alan Dye, read CEO Mark Zuckerberg's 'welcome note'",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/meta-hires-longtime-apple-design-vp-alan-dye-read-ceo-mark-zuckerbergs-welcome-note/articleshow/125765144.cms,"Alan Dye, attending a GQ even last month, is leaving Apple for Meta.

Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg welcome note

I'm excited to welcome Alan and Billy to Meta to work with me, Boz, and our team to drive this important work forward.

We're entering a new era where AI glasses and other devices will change how we connect with technology and each other. The potential is enormous, but what matters most is making these experiences feel natural and truly centered around people. With this new studio, we're focused on making every interaction thoughtful, intuitive, and built to serve people.

Alan will be joined by Billy Sorrentino, another acclaimed design lead from Apple; Joshua To, who has led our interface design across Reality Labs; our industrial design team led by Pete Bristol; and our metaverse design and art teams led by Jason Rubin.

The new studio will bring together design, fashion, and technology to define the next generation of our products and experiences. Our idea is to treat intelligence as a new design material and imagine what becomes possible when it is abundant, capable, and human-centered. We plan to elevate design within Meta, and pull together a talented group with a combination of craft, creative vision, systems thinking, and deep experience building iconic products that bridge hardware and software,” wrote Zuckerberg.

Dye’s legacy at Apple

Since taking over Apple’s design studio in 2015, he helped shape the look and feel of flagship products including the Apple Watch, iPhone X, and the Vision Pro headset. Most recently, he oversaw Liquid Glass, Apple’s new interface design that gives UI elements a transparent, fluid aesthetic.Bloomberg, which first reported his move, noted that Dye’s team also worked on upcoming smart home hardware.","Alan dye, one of apple’s most influential design leaders, is leaving apple for meta.

In Oct, he said in an interview with the New York Times that to ""keep the ship afloat"" he was selling several of his watches through Phillips, a leading auction house.On Saturday, during a frenzied bidding war on Park Avenue, an F.P.Journe timepiece from his collection sold for nearly $11 million. It was the sixth-most-expensive watch to ever be sold at auction. And it is the only watch on that list that was not manufactured by Patek Philippe or Rolex. Coppola designed the watch in 2014 as a collaboration with F.P. Journe, a Swiss watch company whose horological marvels are so expensive that they make Rolex look like Swatch.Called the FFC, the watch sold on Saturday has an openwork design, which means its inner workings are on display. (The style is referred to as a skeleton dial.) In the center of the face is a gloved hand with fingers that disappear and reappear in various configurations depending on the hour.F.P. Journe was founded in 1999 by Francois-Paul Journe. Today, it has a dozen stores around the world in cities such as New York, London, Dubai, Tokyo and Paris.It produces and sells around 900 watches a year. And watch geeks are notoriously nasty about the merits of the company's timepieces. Just a handful of the FFC watches, which retail for around $1 million, were ever made.In 2021, a prototype sold for close to $5 million at Only Watch, a biennial charity auction held in Geneva and sponsored by Prince Albert II of Monaco. Going into this week's sale, Paul Boutros, the deputy chairman and head of Phillips Watches for North America, professed to have little idea what Coppola's watch might fetch.After bidding topped out at $9 million (the final price of $10.755 million includes auction fees), there was a mix of shock and resignation among high-end watch industry dealers. ""It's an extraordinary price, but the Journe market is on fire,"" said Andrew Shear, a dealer who regularly sells watches that fetch six figures.Jacek Kozubek, who runs the site Tropical Watch, said many high-end watches appeal to men who want to look like superheroes. Journe timepieces, in his estimation, are more akin to watches for real-life Marvel villains.Eric Wind, a rival of Kozubek's on the secondary market, currently has two Journes available on his site. ""The worst of the worst is trying to buy them,"" he said. ""I never would have predicted these would be the ultimate catnip for watch enthusiasts,"" he added, ""but they're definitely the hottest watches today."". The person who bought Coppola's watch was anonymous, meaning the motivation for the purchase is unknown. NYT","Filmmaker francis ford coppola's watch sold for $11 million.

Rewire impulses?

Can a law rewire those impulses?

'It's not our choice'

'The horse has already bolted'





MELBOURNE: Darcey Pritchard, 15, deleted Snapchat off her phone about a year ago when she felt sucked in by its algorithm.Her friend Luca Hagop, also 15, recently spent more than 34 hours on Instagram in one week, sharing pet videos and other reels ""so random, they're funny because they're so unfunny.""Amelie Tomlinson, 14, keeps up with her friends on Snapchat, and until recently, had almost no one's phone number.Her friend Jasmine Bentley, 15, is not allowed on any social media but dreams of being a content creator.The two sets of friends, living in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne, Australia, offer a small window into the wildly different relationships today's teens have with social media. But they are united on one front: They do not think a new Australian law that bars children under 16 from having social media accounts, which takes effect Wednesday, will change their lives much.Australia passed the law a year ago, setting itself up to be a test case for what many parents say feels like this generation's Sisyphean task -- shielding children from the risks associated with social media until they are capable of navigating it responsibly.But these teenagers, born around the same time that Instagram and Snapchat were first released, are digital natives. Most know how to use VPNs, which may help them evade the ban.Many fudged their ages when they first signed up, to get around the minimum age of 13 for many social media services. Others have used their parents' information to get accounts, or have older siblings whose identities they can co-opt.More than anything, social media is just too deeply embedded into their lives.""It's how we communicate,"" Amelie said.Darcey said some of her friends had been talking about migrating to new apps. ""You're not going to stop these people,"" she said.In recent years, parents around the world have grappled with increasing alarm about social media's detriments to mental health, potential to enable online bullying and effects on developing brains.Australia was one of the first countries to pass a nationwide law to address those concerns. Last December, it set 16 as the minimum age for social media accounts, meaning hundreds of thousands of younger children would lose theirs. Other nations, like Malaysia, have followed suit with similar plans.Australia is putting the onus on the social media companies to keep younger children off their platforms and will not penalize parents or children who violate the law. Officials, including Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, have tried to tamp down expectations that the law will be an overnight fix.They say they are supporting parents who feel powerless against the lure of social media and peer pressure among teens. Anika Wells, the minister for communications, described an almost idyllic new reality with children awash in time for sports, baking or learning a new language.But it will be far from that simple. The lives and friendships of many 13- to 15-year-olds are enmeshed with social media -- even if the children are not on it themselves.For instance, when Darcey and her friends were playing an online guessing game, many of the clues were memes everyone else had seen on Instagram. When Amelie and a friend got to school 15 minutes before the first bell, they made four TikTok videos. When Jasmine puts on makeup, she will record herself, even though she is not on social media. And when Luca's mother died a few years ago, he found it helpful to type out his feelings on an anonymous server on Discord.Currently, 10 social media services are covered by the ban: Facebook, Instagram, Kick, Reddit, Snapchat, Threads, TikTok, Twitch, X and YouTube. The companies have said that they do not believe a blanket ban is the best way to keep children safe, but that they will nevertheless deactivate accounts of children under 16.""They're ripping away something that has grown on us and become more part of our lives every day,"" Jasmine said.Two popular apps in Australia in the weeks leading up to the law were ""Yope,"" a photo sharing app targeting Generation Z, and ""lemon8,"" a TikTok alternative owned by the same parent company, ByteDance, portending a potential game of Whac-a-Mole with regulators.Luca jokes that Darcey lives under a ""1984"" regime when it comes to social media and phones, a nod to the all-controlling government in George Orwell's novel.Her parents have set daily time limits on apps for her and her two younger siblings -- for Darcey, five minutes on YouTube, 30 minutes for WhatsApp, 10 minutes on Spotify -- and ""downtime"" overnight.It is a careful equilibrium reached after many family discussions and a few charged, tearful fights. But it also means that after school on a recent afternoon, she spent hours talking to her father about her German homework, helping cook dinner and watching ""The Simpsons"" with her brothers, while her phone sat untouched in the designated spot on the kitchen counter. And when she found herself mindlessly scrolling on Snapchat, she herself decided to get off the app.Caroline and Joel Pritchard, Darcey's parents, said it seemed like a lonely uphill battle to restrict their children's phone usage.""It almost will feel like a bit of weight off our shoulders for the government to step in and go, hey, it's just banned,"" Joel Pritchard said. ""We can now turn around and say, 'Hey, it's not our choice.'""Darcey, who has been talking and thinking about social media's effects on her peers through her involvement in a youth-driven initiative called Project Rockit, said that limiting teenagers' use was only delaying the problem, and letting companies off the hook from making their platforms free of potentially harmful content.""It shouldn't be the user's fault,"" she said. ""The social media companies really need to take a bit more responsibility.""Luca, her friend since primary school, has always had free rein over his internet and phone use. He found a creative game building community on Discord -- which will not be affected by the law -- and enjoys science videos on YouTube.Instagram, he said, is just an easy pastime, which takes less effort than, say, setting up a board game. Even though at times he has felt ""trapped"" by its algorithm, he thinks he can outsmart it by shutting down the app when he sees videos he does not like.""Today I liked a few dog reels in a row, and then I got only dog videos for a few hours,"" he said on a recent afternoon, when he had stayed home sick from school.His father, Adrian Hagop, said he had always trusted that Luca and his older brother were mature and responsible enough to make their own decisions, and believed they should learn to deal with problems they may encounter online, rather than coddle them from unknown perils.His approach is to let them have those experiences and come to him to talk about it afterward if need be. Even after the ban, if Luca wants to be on social media, Hagop said he would help him get an account.""Both my kids are fairly skeptical, so I kind of trust them,"" he said. ""I think it depends on the kid.""When Amelie was trying to persuade her parents to allow her on TikTok, she pleaded her case in a five-page, single-spaced letter about not wanting to feel left out.Her mother, Catherine Best, said she felt that parents had lost control years ago. When Amelie had just started primary school, Best deleted YouTube off her daughter's school-required iPad because she was watching toy unboxing videos nonstop. The school insisted on reinstalling it because teachers used educational videos on YouTube in class.""That was really the gateway,"" said Best, who said the law was too little, too late. ""I feel like the horse has already bolted.""Amelie said that, like many of her friends, she had two TikTok accounts, both set to private: one for just close friends and the other for a wider group. The account with her friends has her age set to 19, so she was not worried about losing access.But she was exchanging phone numbers with friends for the first time in anticipation of losing her Snapchat account. This month, the app prompted her to verify her age -- set to 16 -- with a selfie, and it approved her as being old enough to continue using her account, she said.Amelie said she recognized how much she reached for her phone. Her screen time ""goes nuts"" on school holidays.""It's just an instinct to pick up my phone,"" she said, ""which I don't like.""Jasmine, a friend of Amelie's since the beginning of high school, said she felt like her generation's social media usage was misunderstood by grown-ups. Even though she is not on social media, her group of friends often film TikTok videos when they hang out.""There's a lot of creative freedom,"" she said. ""We're doing other things than just watching videos and scrolling, there's a lot more to it.""Her father, Craig Bentley, said even if Jasmine was inevitably exposed to social media, he felt better knowing she would always be with a friend, rather than scrolling on her own.Bentley, a high school teacher, said he had witnessed young minds shift as smartphones grew more pervasive, attention spans growing shorter and self-regulation dwindling.As for the law, he said, any effect would be for the better. At a minimum, he said, it will send the message that Australia will not stand for these apps taking control of a generation.""I hope there's a revolution against it and we all just decide it's not OK,"" he said.","A new australian law that bars children under 16 from having social media accounts takes effect wednesday. Many 13- to 15-year-olds are enmeshed with social media, even if the children are not on it themselves. Most know how to use vpns, which may help them evade the ban.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125824452,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-944823,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"

Overview of e-invoicing system

Detailed penalties for non-compliance





Delay in system implementation:

Dh5,000 fine per month, or part of a month, for failing to implement the e-invoicing system or appoint an accredited service provider within the required timeline. Non issuance of invoices and credit notes:

Dh100 penalty for each electronic invoice not issued and transmitted on time, capped at Dh5,000 per month.

Dh100 penalty for each electronic credit note not issued and transmitted on time, also capped at Dh5,000 per month. Failure to notify system failures:

Dh1,000 fine per day, or part thereof, for issuers or recipients who do not notify the FTA of system failures within the required timeline. Failure to update accredited service providers:

Dh1,000 fine per day, or part of a day, for issuers or recipients who fail to inform the appointed service provider of changes to data registered with the FTA.

Operational implications for businesses









The UAE is setting a clear deadline for businesses to adopt electronic invoicing, with substantial penalties for delays or non-compliance. From July 2026, every invoice, credit note, and system notification will carry financial consequences, underscoring the government’s drive for accuracy, transparency, and operational discipline in tax reporting.The UAE introduced electronic invoicing regulations in the second quarter of 2025, aiming to modernize tax processes and improve efficiency. Under the system, invoices are generated, exchanged, and reported electronically to the Federal Tax Authority (FTA) in a structured, machine readable format such as XML. This replaces traditional paper or PDF invoices and ensures greater accuracy, transparency, and speed in VAT and other tax-related processes.The rollout is scheduled in phases, with the first phase going live in July 2026. Compliance is mandatory for all businesses that fall under the e-invoicing framework. Companies experimenting voluntarily are not subject to the penalties outlined by the authorities.Cabinet Decision No. 106 of 2025 outlines a structured penalty system for various breaches related to e-invoicing. These include:These penalties are cumulative and are designed to enforce discipline across all transactional and operational layers of a business.The decision also reinforces the importance of strong governance over business data. Companies must ensure that any changes to registered information are promptly communicated to the accredited service provider. Failing to do so triggers the same daily Dh1,000 fines, transforming master data management from an administrative task into a critical compliance requirement.Overall, the UAE’s approach positions e-invoicing as a regulated operational model, requiring businesses to invest in systems readiness, robust controls, and rapid incident response. Organizations that delay or mishandle compliance face clear financial consequences, making early preparation essential.","Businesses in the uae must comply with e-invoicing or face dh5,000 penalties.

Building the world’s factory of intelligence





Stargate campus and capacity plans





Economic and energy implications





Looking ahead









The United Arab Emirates is aiming to redefine the global AI landscape by planning to produce a staggering 60 trillion AI tokens at its Stargate AI campus in Abu Dhabi. Omar Al Olama, the UAE’s Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence, Digital Economy, and Remote Work Applications, described this goal as a step toward transforming the country into the “world’s factory of intelligence. ”AI tokens are the smallest units of data that AI systems use to learn, process, and generate information. They break down text, images, audio, and video into manageable pieces, where each token can include letters, numbers, punctuation marks, or spaces. The process of converting raw data into these units is known as tokenisation.These tokens are essential for AI models to understand relationships within data, enabling tasks such as prediction, reasoning, and content generation. In modern AI systems, the speed and volume of token processing, referred to as token throughput, directly determine the system’s intelligence and output quality.A new type of data centre, called an AI factory, has emerged to handle this scale. Unlike conventional data centres, which primarily store and compute data, AI factories are optimized to process massive numbers of tokens efficiently, converting raw data into real-time insights.In this sense, AI factories manufacture intelligence at scale, and tokens serve as the currency of this production.At the Milken Middle East and Africa Summit in Abu Dhabi, Al Olama outlined the UAE’s vision for becoming the “world’s factory of intelligence.” He emphasized that AI factories like Stargate are designed to convert data into intelligence that can enhance decision-making, productivity, and quality of life. “The currency of the future is going to be tokens, that can be used and transformed into insights or intelligence that will help in decision making, improve the quality of life and improve productivity,” he said.The Stargate campus forms the core of the UAE’s AI ambitions. It is designed as a hyperscale facility with a planned capacity of 1 gigawatt, ultimately part of a larger 5GW AI campus in Abu Dhabi. By 2026, Stargate is expected to operate at 200 megawatts, with capacity scaled over time according to demand. “We are not looking at this blindly. We are going to increase capacity as demand increases as well. You can create a 5GW facility today … it could increase or decrease over time, but from where we stand today, 5GW is what we're going to have,” Al Olama said.He also addressed concerns about potential overvaluation in the AI sector, drawing parallels with the early internet era. “The dot-com bubble was a bubble in that time period. If you look at it in hindsight, the internet wasn't a bubble. The largest companies in the world became internet companies and it transformed our lives. If your time frame was five years, then the word bubble was right. If your time frame was 20, then the word bubble was wrong because the numbers today are much higher than they ever were. ”AI adoption is already delivering tangible economic benefits in the UAE. Al Olama revealed that AI tools in energy production have saved the country around Dh500 million ($136 million). Companies like Adnoc Distribution are leveraging AI to streamline operations, reduce production costs, and improve efficiency. “We have a metric for measurement when it comes to energy. How many barrels of oil are we producing? Or how can we reduce the cost of production using AI? We’ve had savings so far of around Dh500 million. We are seeing much more savings over time. The end product of that will be productivity gains, and it will be economic returns,” he said.The UAE’s approach positions AI tokens as a strategic national asset. With a planned 60 trillion tokens, equivalent to about 60 percent of global AI token production, the country is aiming to secure a commanding role in the global AI economy. Al Olama described token throughput as a modern equivalent to oil or rare earth minerals, emphasizing that controlling this capacity enables the UAE to export intelligence while supporting domestic innovation.While no specific timeline has been provided for achieving the 60 trillion token goal, the UAE is steadily progressing toward its target, guided by careful planning and international partnerships. Al Olama acknowledged uncertainties in scaling the project, stating, “No one is certain about anything, but the investment is there. As long as our partners work with us and we're able to get what we need at the right time, then we are certain. ”The Stargate AI campus represents more than just a technological project. It is a statement of intent, signaling the UAE’s determination to establish itself as a global AI powerhouse. With strategic infrastructure, economic incentives, and careful scaling, the Emirates is creating a sustainable AI ecosystem that could transform industries and redefine national competitiveness in the 21st century.","Uae’s stargate ai campus set to produce 60 trillion tokens, turning data into global intelligence.

Additional services: The card covers several other essential aspects to ensure a smooth and organized pilgrimage experience.



Digital and physical access





Saudi Arabia has taken a significant step to make the Umrah pilgrimage smoother and more organized for both domestic and international visitors. The Ministry of Hajj and Umrah has expanded the “Nusk” card, now available digitally for residents within the Kingdom and in printed form for pilgrims arriving from abroad.According to AJEL.SA , an Engineer Abdul Aziz Al-Mutahmi, Undersecretary of the Ministry of Hajj and Umrah for Digital Transformation, explained that the initiative, branded as “Nusk Al-Umrah,” aims to centralize essential pilgrimage services into a single, easy-to-use card. “The card facilitates a number of direct services for pilgrims,” Al-Mutahmi said in a telephone interview with Al-Ekhbariya channel.The card is designed to simplify logistical aspects of the pilgrimage, helping pilgrims access critical services quickly and efficiently. Among the services covered are:Domestic pilgrims can now use the card digitally through mobile devices, while international visitors will receive a printed version upon arrival. This dual approach ensures accessibility for all pilgrims, regardless of their origin or technological comfort level.With the introduction of “Nusk Al-Umrah,” Saudi Arabia continues to modernize the pilgrimage experience, combining technology with logistical planning to offer a safer, more convenient, and more connected journey for millions of worshippers each year.","Nusk al-umrah card offers digital services for domestic, printed access for international pilgrims.

Why does the 5-year Saudi Resident ID matter?

Absher: Saudi ’s digital government platform

How does the new system work?

Bigger picture





Saudi Arabia introduced a new “Resident ID” system that replaces the old annual residency-renewal routine with a single, five-year card and a simplified online workflow. Officials and local outlets say the move will dramatically cut visits to passport and residency offices for over 13 million residents, reduce waiting times and move most transactions onto the Absher / e-services platforms.The core benefit is practical: instead of renewing an Iqama every year (and standing in long lines), residents will get a card valid for five years and renew digitally via Absher. Reports estimate this will eliminate tens of millions of annual visits to government counters and save households and the economy substantial time and cost. Fees mentioned in local coverage put the one-time five-year cost at roughly SAR 500 for adults and SAR 600 for domestic workers, replacing repeated annual payments.Absher is Saudi Arabia’s official digital platform that allows residents and citizens to access government services without visiting physical offices. Operated by the Ministry of Interior, it connects more than 350 services from different government entities in one place.Through Absher, users can renew residency permits, update personal information, pay government fees, book appointments, track applications, and receive official documents through registered postal addresses.It works across web and mobile apps, and every user has a secure digital profile linked to their identity.Absher has become one of Saudi Arabia’s most important digital-government tools, handling millions of transactions every day and reducing paperwork, queues, and in-person visits. The new Resident ID system relies on Absher as the main portal for issuing, renewing and managing the five-year ID, making the process fully online and significantly faster.The rollout is tied to Saudi’s digital services: applicants will be able to request and manage the Resident ID through Absher and related government platforms. The new ID is designed to work as a trusted digital identity (usable in transactions and verifications), and the authorities ask residents to register a postal address through the “Wasil”/“Wasil Digital” (Waṣil) mail service so official documents and the physical card are delivered reliably. The interior ministry’s e-services page has long supported the electronic issuance and renewal of resident documents, the new plan makes that the standard.This monumental policy shift is not just about convenience; it is a core pillar of Saudi Arabia's ambitious Vision 2030. The comprehensive strategy aims to modernize the government structure and transition the Kingdom into a global digital leader. By eliminating the time-consuming annual renewal cycle, the government expects to cut out an astonishing 65 million annual visits to public service offices over the next five years.This reduction in administrative clutter translates directly into massive economic gains. Experts predict the new electronic system will save the national economy over 2.6 billion Saudi Riyals by dramatically reducing wasted time and boosting overall productivity. Dr. Khalid, a Digital Government Expert, lauded the change, describing it as a ""qualitative leap, like moving from using copper coins to adopting bank cards.

After months of subtle hints and growing speculation, Emirati creator Khalid Al Ameri and Indian actor Sunaina Yella appear to have made their relationship public, not through an announcement but through a single mirror selfie tucked at the end of his birthday post.Khalid Al Ameri, known for blending humor with cultural commentary, shared a carousel of dimly lit, intimate birthday photos on Instagram that immediately caught the internet’s attention.

Two more photos with Sunaina appeared, including another shot of their hands intertwined and a picture captioned,The speculation surrounding their relationship did not begin with the birthday post. It traces back to June 2024, when Sunaina shared a photo of herself holding someone’s hand. The image gained traction after Khalid liked it, followed by Sunaina liking his own post of two ring-wearing hands, a black-and-white image he captioned. Many interpreted both posts as quiet declarations.As speculation intensified, Sunaina briefly addressed the chatter. In a statement responding to circulating articles, she wrote,The hints did not stop there. On 8 February 2025, she uploaded a picture of Indian chaat and reposted a high-tea moment. Khalid posted identical images at the same time, both shot in Dubai, and one of them was widely believed to have been taken by him. Together, the posts deepened public curiosity.Khalid Al Ameri has built a following of more than 3.2 million through relatable sketches, family-oriented videos, and cross-cultural humor. His rising visibility in India, including his debut in the Malayalam filmearlier this year, has led to increased interest in his personal life.Before this new chapter, Khalid was married to fellow UAE influencer Salama.

Out(rage)d! Cashing in on your anger,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/outraged-cashing-in-on-your-anger-oxford-rage-bait-word-of-the-year-2025/articleshow/125800368.cms,"Is your 'rage' their product?



Do you have the choice to not get 'rage baited'?



Are women at the receiving end of this rage?







If you clicked on that headline, sorry — you’ve just been rage-baited.But that's exactly what the platforms are doing, rage-baiting us into their content.That’s why 'rage bait' didn’t just trend this year, it muscled its way to Oxford’s Word of the Year for 2025, beating out terms like 'aura farming' and 'biohack' without even breaking a sweat.Rage bait is defined as “online content deliberately designed to elicit anger or outrage by being frustrating, provocative, or offensive, typically posted in order to increase traffic to or engagement with a particular web page or social media content”.Is it the same as clickbait? No.For instance, don’t read this article. It can make you angry — that would’ve been a classic clickbait headline. Tugging at curiosity, not outrage.To understand this phenomenon, the TOI spoke with economic and psychological experts.One of Oxford's reasons for its selection of 'rage bait' for the top post was its threefold increase in the last 12 months. It also noted a ""deeper shift"" in ""how we talk about attention — both how it is given and how it is sought after — engagement, and ethics online.""Does this mean that people's 'rage' is the new kind of 'attention' that platforms like Instagram, Facebook, X and other social media websites are competing to get?""Anger holds economic value on digital platform,"" said Surya Bhushan, an alumnus of, CESP, JNU, now economics professor at DMI, Patna.He added that ""they drive higher engagement metrics — like comments, shares, and views — that platforms reward with algorithmic boosts and direct monetisation.""Does this mean that if you type ""hasna tha kya"" on someone's standup reel, the algorithm will push more such reels just because you got angry?Content creator Divija Bhasin, who sees this dynamic in real time, however, disagreed. ""I don’t think the algorithm pushes my content specifically to people who will be offended by it,"" she said, who recently received extreme reactions on her ""proud R-movement"", a reel she posted after getting repeated called the Hindi slur word.However, she further noted that while the algorithm doesn’t push content to offended people on purpose, it ends up sending it to people who will be offended by it because it cannot differentiate between “positive” interest shown vs “negative” interest shown.""Anger-based content definitely undermines consumer autonomy,"" the professor said.He added that though the consumers have freedom to ""scroll or engage"", the rage bait content ""prioritises emotional hacks over rational choice"", calling it a way of ""trapping users in addictive loops of reaction and counter reactions.""Herbert Marcuse, who was a part of the Frankfurt school of critical theory in the 20th century, helps make sense of this. He argued that capitalism creates choices that feel liberating but mostly serve the system.Can rage bait be classified as that? Are social media platforms built to reward it? Does it mean that when we think we’re choosing what to watch, we’re really choosing from options designed to keep us reacting, not thinking?Bhasin, who is also a psychotherapist, noted that since ""misogynistic content is normalised"" and doesn’t act as rage bait ""for the average audience, especially men"", any kind of ""progressive content"" ends up being at the receiving end of their anger.""Misogynistic content is normalised and therefore doesn’t create a sense of rage for the average audience, especially men. So inevitably, any kind of progressive content is titled as rage bait because change from the norm will always evoke some level of denial in the viewer. It makes it seem like feminist content creators just want to make people angry,"" she said.""When actually it is sad that misogynistic content does not make people angry. Misogynistic content is the real rage bait as it capitalises on the subjugation of women,"" she added.Indian online spaces are increasingly turning into hotspots for gender-based violence, a report by international human-rights groups Equality Now and Breakthrough Trust found, as it went on to highlight the gaps in the legal framework.Bhasin cited concerns over the lax attitude of online platforms, saying that they ""definitely capitalise on rage shown by men on purpose by not doing something to fix this problem.""""They are definitely aware of the kind of hate men spread on female influencers’ content. They are choosing to ignore it because it counts as time spent on the time, even if it is to hate on female influencers,"" she said.","Rage bait is defined as ‘online content deliberately designed to elicit anger or outrage by being frustrating, provocative, or offensive, typically posted in order to increase traffic to or engagement with a particular web page or social media content’ 'anger holds economic value on digital platform,' said surya bhushan, an alumnus of, cesp, jnu, now economics professor.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125804459,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1340472,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-500/photo.jpg"
"'Make it per day': Iran-born Silicon Valley CTO who hires from India jokes about yearly $100,000 H-1B visa fee",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/make-it-per-day-iran-born-silicon-valley-cto-who-hires-from-india-jokes-about-yearly-100000-h-1b-visa-fee/articleshow/125809915.cms,"Who is Shahriar Tajbakhsh ?





Shahriar Tajbakhsh, the CTO and co-founder of Metaview AI, which sells software to help automate job interviews, joked about the $100,000 H-1B yearly visa fee and said 'make it per day'. The company recently created a social media stir as they did their hiring in India, the hub of H-1B, fearing neither the fee nor the prevalent sentiment in the US against H-1B. When the fee was announced in September, he called it a 'rounding error' compared to the value the H-1B staff members add to the team.""Make it per day,” he posted as the MetaView hiring posters in India went viral. ""I’ll set up a recurring payment,"" he added, making it clear that the fee does not matter to his company.""Yes, we still sponsor H-1Bs""; ""No, AI won't build itself,"" Metaview AI's recent hiring posters in India read.Iranian-origin Shahriar Tajbakhsh is a technology entrepreneur and engineer. He did his BSc in Computer Science from University College London. He worked at Palatir Technologies before starting Metaview in 2018. Metaview is London-based but now expanded to the US. Tajbaksh told Business Insider earlier this year that his company plans to submit more H-1B petitions in the next lottery and Trump's executive order will not change his belief that an organization's success or failure is a function of its people.Tajbakhsh, however, is not an H-1B. He revealed that he was relocating to the US on an EB-1 visa which is an employment-based, first preference visa for an individual of extraordinary abilities, or an outstanding professor or researcher, or a multinational executive or manager. ""When you sum up the value created by people's hard work, $100,000 just doesn't matter. The only way to build anything meaningful that changes people's lives is to have a world-class team — there's no shortcut around that. Trying to save money on talent is the most irresponsible thing a founder could possibly do,"" Tajbakhsh said.","Shahriar tajbakhsh is the cto and co-founder of metaview ai, which sells software to help automate job interviews.
