The company will provide affected staff with severance benefits, outplacement services, and extended insurance coverage.

TCS Layoffs : What’s Behind The Move?

TCS layoffs: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS), which is India's largest IT services firm, plans to lay off over 12,000 employees over this year. This is nearly a 2% reduction in the workforce of the IT giant, an unprecedented number for the IT firm.In an official statement, TCS told ET, “TCS is on a journey to become a future-ready organisation… As part of this journey, we will also be releasing associates from the organisation whose deployment may not be feasible. This will impact about 2% of our global workforce, primarily in the middle and the senior grades, over the course of the year.”In the April-June quarter, the leading six IT companies saw 72% reduction in workforce expansion, with only 3,847 new hires, compared to 13,935 recruitments during the January-March period.India's IT services sector, which generates combined revenues of over $283 billion, has software companies ranked amongst the biggest private employers. TCS leads as the largest employer in this segment.According to the report, ongoing economic uncertainties and disruptions caused by AI technologies are impacting business demands.The Tata group subsidiary, based in Mumbai, has a total employee count of 613,069 at the close of June 2025.According to a Reuters report, the layoffs will majorly affect people in the middle to senior management positions and around 12,200 people will be asked to leave.According to HFS Research's CEO Phil Fersht, artificial intelligence is diminishing the labour-intensive service delivery approach in the industry.""(That model) is forcing large service providers such as TCS to rebalance their workforces to maintain profit margins and stay price-competitive in a cut-throat market where clients are demanding 20-30% price reductions,"" Fersht was quoted by Reuters.He further noted that this action by TCS, known for providing stable employment, underscores this industry-wide development.The impacted employees who will be asked leave will be provided with notice period compensation and extra severance benefits. Additionally, TCS plans to provide insurance coverage extension and career transition assistance to those affected by this decision, the report said.TCS also said, “This transition is being planned with due care to ensure there is no impact on service delivery to our clients… We understand that this is a challenging time for our colleagues likely to be affected. We thank them for their service and we will be making all efforts to provide appropriate benefits, outplacement, counselling, and support as they transition to new opportunities.""This workforce reduction comes within days of many TCS staff employees initiating legal proceedings challenging the company's modified bench policy. The revised policy stipulates that employees can only remain unbilled for 35 days annually and must achieve a minimum of 225 billable days per year.Recently it was reported that TCS has delayed the onboarding of 600 lateral hires. TCS issued a notice regarding 'indefinite delay', without providing any new joining dates for the selected technology professionals.NITES (Nascent Information Technology Employees Senate) has escalated this matter to Union Labour Minister Mansukh Mandaviya through a written communication, highlighting concerns about the financial difficulties and psychological stress faced by these professionals due to the uncertain situation.TCS announced its comprehensive strategic approach, which includes investments in emerging technologies, market expansion, large-scale AI implementation for clients and internal operations, strengthening partnerships, developing advanced infrastructure and restructuring their employment framework.To achieve these objectives, various programmes focused on skill enhancement and staff reallocation have been initiated and are currently in progress.","Tata consultancy services plans to reduce its workforce by approximately 2%, impacting over 12,000 employees.

"Government to overhaul accreditation system, operationalise AI centre",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/government-to-overhaul-accreditation-system-operationalise-ai-centre/articleshow/122962055.cms,"NEW DELHI: Marking five years of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020, Centre is set to announce a major reform in the accreditation system for higher education institutions by shifting to a binary model - 'accredited' or 'not accredited' - replacing the existing multi-tiered grading system. This means institutions will no longer be ranked against each other but assessed against uniform minimum standards.On the anvil is also the launch of a new 'Bharatiya Bhasha' digital tool for direct translations between Indian languages, bypassing English as a mediator. In addition, govt will operationalise a Centre of Excellence in AI in education, as announced in the 2025 Union Budget.These announcements are expected to be made on Tuesday at a national event commemorating the fifth anniversary of NEP-2020, in the presence of senior ministers, educationists and state representatives at the Bharat Mandapam here.The new accreditation model aims at simplifying the process and encourage wider participation among higher education institutions (HEIs). Unlike the earlier framework, which graded institutions (A++, A, B, etc.), the new binary system will require institutions to meet basic benchmarks to qualify as 'accredited'. A senior education ministry official said, ""The change was designed to address the reluctance of many HEIs to apply for accreditation due to the effort involved and uncertainty about securing a favourable grade.The shift comes in the wake of concerns over credibility and participation in the current accreditation regime, particularly following recent controversies around the functioning of the National Assessment and Accreditation Council (Naac). Inconsistent grading patterns and allegations of opacity had drawn criticism from academics and policymakers, prompting a rethink of the process.Elaborating on the new approach, the official said, ""Under the new model, all institutions that meet benchmark standards will be treated equally in the first phase. Grading from 1 to 5 will follow in the second stage, expected to begin in the next five to six months. Institutions will climb the grading ladder sequentially - starting from Grade 1 - based on verified performance data.""The data validation will rely on a triangulation method, using multiple sources and tools to ensure accuracy, and will exclude Naac's direct involvement. Instead, only govt agencies and Institutions of National Importance will be engaged for verification, and there will be no physical inspections.The 'Bharatiya Bhasha' digital tool will allow seamless translations between Indian languages without routing through English - for instance, enabling direct translation from Assamese to Tamil. In higher education, the Centre of Excellence in AI in education is set to be formally launched to support research and integration of AI tools in teaching and learning.For school education, announcements are expected on targeted infrastructure improvement and expansion of access, including new buildings for Kendriya Vidyalayas and Navodaya Vidyalayas, with corresponding funding support.","New binary model - 'accredited' or 'not accredited' - to replace existing multi-tiered grading system.

DeAndre Ayton left his companion stranded on an island

DeAndre Ayton recently joined Los Angeles Lakers from Portland Trail Blazers

What could have been a chill summer outing turned horrendous when an Instagram model was left stranded on an island. Or at least that's what the rumors say. Los Angeles Lakers center, DeAndre Ayton, allegedly went on a trip to Turks & Caicos with said model, and then allegedly had his security kick her out when she refused his advances to have s*x with him. Ayton has not responded to any of the allegations yet, but if this is true, his upcoming journey with the Lakers could get into some hot water.DeAndre Ayton and an Instagram model with the handle caribbeancurlss allegedly went on a trip to Turks & Caicos this summer, before the league starts back up in October. Whether they went there together or met up at the island has not been revealed, but according to the model, after she refused Ayton's advances to have s*x with him, he had his security kick her out and left her stranded all by herself.She wasn't going to just let him get away with it and revealed all about her experience with the newest Los Angeles Lakers star on her socials. She posted a story on her Instagram on Sunday, writing, “@deandreayton security Left me outside in the middle of nowhere in Turks of Caicos bc I won’t have have sex with him.”Whether she was able to get back home or is still staying on the islands is unknown. And given Ayton has been keeping mum on the situation only makes it seem like he was in the wrong, and she is telling the truth.Fans are also pointing out that the reason he flew her to the islands was because he was promised something in return, but things turned sour, and he left her. Whatever the reason, stranding someone was probably not the way to go.After a mediocre season with the Portland Trail Blazers, DeAndre Ayton has made his way to the Los Angeles Lakers, where he will be taking the center position for the upcoming season. Playing with the likes of Luka Doncic and LeBron James will, of course, be a highlight for any player, and Ayton is no different, who was the No. 1 pick of the 2018 draft by the Phoenix Suns.But after his recent situation, fans are using a looking glass to get a better view of him. Ayton reached a buyout after the 2024-25 season with the Portland Trail Blazers ahead of free agency and signed a two-year deal with the Lakers for $16 million.

He said he was still working and building and nothing would stop him.Social media users raised alarm that something bad might have happened to Julian because of what he was creating. ""The influencer and scientist Julian Brown also known as naturejab did not post anything after around 2 weeks. His last post was a leak of his drivers license.

Patterson also holds the NFL record for most kickoff return touchdowns, four more than legendary returner Devin Hester.

Life after IAS: Microsoft and AI

A lifelong passion for music

Kashish Mittal is what every Indian parent dreams of and what every nosy relative secretly resents. An IIT topper (AIR 6), IAS officer at 21, Microsoft techie, AI entrepreneur , and now an Indian classical singer — his career timeline reads like a Bollywood script co-written by UPSC aspirants, tech bros, and art lovers. For the middle class, he was the ultimate “shaadi biodata material” until he did the unthinkable: quit the IAS and followed his heart into music. For relatives, his CV is a nightmare, as they hide their jealousy behind forced smiles, and for many others, it’s simply unbelievable. His bold decisions have left family WhatsApp groups stunned and LinkedIn timelines inspired. Today, his soulful lyrics and viral posts are making him India’s most melodious multi-hyphenate.Mittal’s academic excellence was evident early on. After securing an AIR 6 in the JEE, he pursued electrical engineering at IIT Delhi. In 2009, he cracked the UPSC exam and joined the IAS, becoming one of the youngest officers in his batch. He held significant positions, including serving as the private secretary to the Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog. However, in 2019, Mittal made headlines by resigning from the IAS, reportedly dissatisfied with a transfer to Arunachal Pradesh. His departure from civil service sparked debates and admiration alike.Contrary to popular perception that he gave up all structured work, Mittal joined Microsoft after leaving the IAS, working in AI-driven projects. His tech journey didn’t stop there. In 2025, he co-founded an AI startup focused on human potential and ethical technology. His transition from bureaucracy to big tech and now entrepreneurship reflects his diverse interests and adaptability. His work blends technical innovation with philosophical depth, reflecting a rare balance of intellect and introspection.Mittal had been training in Hindustani classical music since childhood. Post-IAS, he gave his full attention to music, performing professionally as a classical vocalist of the Agra Gharana. He is an empanelled artist with ICCR and All India Radio, with his compositions reflecting a blend of spiritual depth and technical rigor. His renditions have gained widespread attention online, with many calling him a rare blend of intellect and art.In addition to his performances, Mittal’s presence on social media has contributed significantly to his viral fame in 2024 and 2025. His LinkedIn posts offer a unique blend of personal reflections, career insights, and poetic musings, resonating particularly well with a generation that values authenticity and non-traditional success stories. Screenshots of his profile and posts circulate widely, sparking conversations about breaking free from societal expectations and pursuing passion alongside professional achievement.Moreover, Mittal’s Instagram reels have garnered massive engagement. A particularly viral reel features him singing Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan’s “Unke Andaz-e-Karam,” amassing nearly 3 million views.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has shared a post on X (formerly Twitter), suggesting a shift in his stance toward artificial intelligence . Admitting he had been “living in denial” about the technology for too long, Elon Musk wrote in the post: “I resisted AI for too long. Living in denial. Now it is game on.” Musk was replying to a post shared by an X user Mario Nawfal that quoted Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang who called Musk a ‘superhuman’.While Elon Musk has been both a vocal critic and early investor in AI, he has previously warned about the dangers of uncontrolled AI development, once calling it humanity’s “biggest existential threat.” His latest statement suggests a more aggressive pivot from caution to action.The post comes as the tech billionaire continues to expand his presence in the AI space through xAI , the startup he launched in 2023 to compete with companies like OpenAI , Google DeepMind, and Anthropic.Elon Musk’s relationship with AI has been complex. The tech CEO co-founded ChatGPT-maker OpenAI in 2015, but later distanced himself from the company. Over the years, he has expressed concerns about AI safety, calling for regulation and greater oversight.While Elon Musk did not elaborate on what specific moves might follow his tweet, observers say the post is likely a signal to investors, rivals, and users that he intends to take a more direct role in AI development. Notably, the tech CEO tagged three of his major companies – Tesla, SpaceX and xAI in his post.Elon Musk’s “game on” remark also hints at increasing competition in the AI sector, where companies are racing to release faster, more powerful language models and build new infrastructure to support them.In a related news, Tesla India recently shared a post on X, announcing an update on the availability of Tesla cars in the country. “Now everyone in India can order directly on our website,” the post read, adding that four cities will get priority delivery.

The rise of physical AI and the future of robotics

During a recent visit to Beijing, Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang was asked what he would study if he were a 20-year-old graduate in 2025. His answer was clear: he’d choose a different academic direction than the one that launched his own career. Though he didn’t explicitly name a single subject, Huang emphasized that he would lean more toward the physical sciences rather than software. This subtle but significant shift points to his evolving view of where the next wave of opportunity lies. His response reflects a broader vision for the future of artificial intelligence—one rooted not just in code, but in physics, robotics , and the mechanics of the real world that AI must increasingly learn to navigate and reason through.Jensen Huang, who earned his electrical engineering degree from Oregon State University and a master’s from Stanford, co-founded Nvidia in 1993. Today, the company sits at the forefront of the AI revolution and recently hit a historic $4 trillion market cap. While reflecting on his own path, Huang revealed he had graduated from college at age 20 and, if given the chance again, would pursue physical sciences, fields that deal with non-living systems like physics, chemistry, and astronomy.Although he didn’t go into specifics about why, Huang’s broader remarks provide insight. Over the years, AI has evolved from “Perception AI,” which focused on recognition tasks like image detection, to “Generative AI,” which includes language models capable of translating, coding, and creating. But the next chapter, according to Huang, is “Reasoning AI,” systems that can understand context, solve novel problems, and act as “agentic AI” or digital robots with reasoning power.Huang’s vision aligns with growing industry momentum around embodied AI—where intelligence is tied to physical systems like robots or autonomous machines. Leading research labs such as DeepMind and Boston Dynamics are already exploring this frontier, integrating reinforcement learning with robotics to train systems capable of real-world interaction and problem-solving. This convergence of AI with physics and motion is what Huang sees as the next great leap.Huang’s remarks hint at a future where AI is not just software-driven but deeply embedded in the physical world. This shift could redefine education paths for aspiring technologists, with physics and engineering regaining center stage. It’s no longer just about writing better code; it’s about building machines that think, move, and adapt. And for Huang, the future of AI might look less like a screen and more like a robot with a brain.Looking ahead, Huang predicts the rise of “Physical AI,” where artificial intelligence must grasp real-world physics: friction, inertia, cause and effect. These capabilities go beyond generating text or images—they involve anticipating how objects move, how to grip items with the right force, or how to infer the presence of hidden obstacles like a pedestrian behind a car.When AI gains this kind of physical reasoning and is embedded into machines, it leads to robotics, a critical component of Huang’s vision. With global labor shortages and the rapid expansion of manufacturing facilities, especially across the United States, Huang sees robotics powered by physical AI as essential. “Hopefully, in the next 10 years... they’re highly robotic and helping us deal with the severe labor shortage,” he said, underscoring the need for innovation that bridges the digital and physical worlds.","Jensen huang predicts the rise of “physical ai,” where artificial intelligence must grasp real-world physics.

AI-powered growth and record investments

From modest beginnings to Silicon Valley’s summit

After a decade at the helm of Alphabet, Sundar Pichai has officially joined the ranks of billionaires, marking a rare achievement for a non-founding tech CEO. Pichai, who took over as CEO of Google in 2015 and became Alphabet’s chief in 2019, now holds a net worth of $1.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The milestone comes after Alphabet’s market value soared by over $1 trillion since early 2023, delivering 120% returns to investors. Pichai’s rise has been defined by his leadership through multiple technological shifts, from mobile and cloud computing to AI. As Alphabet’s shares hit record highs, his decade-long stewardship has culminated in both financial success and strategic transformation.While tech billionaires are often company founders, Pichai’s entry into the billionaire club is different. He holds just 0.02% of Alphabet’s economic stake, currently valued at around $440 million. Most of his net worth comes from share sales and performance-based compensation over the past ten years. Bloomberg reports that he has sold over $650 million in stock during his tenure. If he had retained all his shares, they would now be worth more than $2.5 billion. Despite the modest stake, Pichai’s long-term vision and steady leadership have driven massive growth in Alphabet’s core businesses.August 2025 marks ten years since Pichai became CEO of Google. In that time, Alphabet has expanded rapidly, turning once-nascent divisions like YouTube, Cloud, Play, and Subscriptions into billion-dollar engines. In a recent post on X, Pichai highlighted that in 2015, Alphabet’s total revenue was $75 billion, whereas YouTube and Google Cloud alone are now generating an annual run rate of $110 billion. Under his leadership, Alphabet restructured into a parent holding company, sharpened its AI focus, and increased its global footprint.A major factor in Alphabet’s recent trillion-dollar surge has been its aggressive AI investments . The company spent $50 billion in 2023 alone on infrastructure, semiconductors, and data centers to support its AI ambitions. It also raised its 2025 capital expenditure forecast by $10 billion, reaching $85 billion, most of which is earmarked for AI infrastructure. “Our AI infrastructure investments are crucial to meeting the growth in demand for cloud customers,” Pichai said during the Q2 earnings call. Alphabet’s DeepMind acquisition in 2014 for $400 million has also paid off, helping the company stay ahead in the AI race. Pichai's rise reflects a new era where operational excellence, not just founding status, can build tech empires.Born in Tamil Nadu, India, Sundar Pichai’s journey to Silicon Valley is one of resilience and brilliance. He grew up in a two-room apartment, with his first telephone arriving when he was 12. A scholarship brought him to Stanford in 1993, with a one-way plane ticket that reportedly cost more than his father’s annual salary. Pichai joined Google in 2004, led the development of Chrome, and later oversaw Android, before rising to the top job.Sundar Pichai is also known for his calm, consensus-driven leadership style, which has earned him respect in an industry often defined by bold personalities. In recent years, he has become increasingly vocal on topics like AI regulation, digital privacy, and ethical tech, positioning Alphabet as a global thought leader beyond just innovation.Outside of tech, Pichai has also ventured into sports. He is reportedly part of a group of executives that acquired a 49% stake in the London Spirit cricket team for $182 million. The team competes in The Hundred, a professional cricket league launched in the UK in 2020. While his wealth may not rival that of Alphabet founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, worth $171.2 billion and $160.4 billion respectively, Pichai's path to the billionaire club is proof that transformational leadership, even without a founding stake, can build both companies and fortunes. His rise underscores a shift in Silicon Valley’s power dynamics—where disciplined execution rivals disruptive invention. As Alphabet charts its future, Pichai’s story stands as a model for aspiring global leaders in tech and beyond.","Sundar pichai is now worth $1.1 billion, according to the bloomberg billionaires index.

Asset managers navigate data security challenges

BlackRock , the world's largest asset manager, has imposed new restrictions on company-issued devices for employees traveling to China, requiring staff to use temporary loaner phones and prohibiting company laptops during business trips, according to Bloomberg News and Reuters reports.The financial giant detailed the ""policy enhancement"" in an internal memo effective July 16, barring the use of BlackRock-issued iPhones, iPads, laptops, and remote access via virtual private networks while in China. Employees will also lose access to the BlackRock network during personal travel to the country, Bloomberg reported.The move reflects mounting corporate anxiety about business operations in China as geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing continue to strain international business relationships. BlackRock did not immediately respond to requests for comment from either Reuters or Bloomberg.The restrictions come after a series of high-profile incidents involving Western business executives being prevented from leaving China. Wells Fargo suspended travel to China last week after one of its senior trade financing bankers, Chenyue Mao, was blocked from departing the country in what Beijing's foreign ministry described as a criminal matter.Earlier this month, China also prevented a US Patent and Trademark Office employee from leaving during a personal visit, while a US Commerce Department worker has reportedly been unable to leave China for several months.Since China implemented stricter data security laws in 2021, global financial firms have struggled to balance operational needs with compliance requirements. Many banks and asset managers have established onshore data centers to keep Chinese information within the country, adding significant costs and complicating business management.BlackRock maintains a substantial presence in China through a wholly owned mutual fund company and a wealth management joint venture with China Construction Bank Corp. The firm's new travel policy reflects the broader challenges facing global financial institutions operating in an increasingly complex regulatory and security environment between the world's two largest economies.In related news, Amazon is shutting down its AI lab in Shanghai amid rising geopolitical tensions between the US and China. Launched in 2018, this lab contributed to over 100 academic papers and helped develop a neural network framework that generated close to $1 billion in sales, according to a scientist at the lab.As reported by The Financial Times, the development was confirmed by Wang Minjie, a scientist at the lab, via a social media post on China's WeChat. The lab was established by Amazon Web Services (AWS) in 2018 and Wang stated that his team was being “dissolved due to strategic adjustments amid US-China tensions,” and reflected on the “golden era of foreign research labs” in China.",Blackrock has imposed new restrictions on company-issued devices for employees traveling to china.

Margin Pressures:

Bench Policy:

Sudden Exits:

Campus Chaos:

BENGALURU: TCS laying off over 12,000 mid- and senior-level employees has sent shockwaves across the tech industry. This move not just challenges the perception of TCS as a company known for job security and stability, but shows that India's IT sector is in the early stages of a significant reset. The industry is undergoing a structural shift, mirroring global trends where major tech firms are streamlining resources, improving cost efficiency, reallocating assets, and shutting down divisions that no longer align with strategic priorities.Industry experts attribute this transformation to mounting margin pressures, prompting companies to control costs by reducing headcount. Many believe that AI is disrupting the traditional workforce pyramid, replacing broad-based hiring models with leaner, more specialised structures which yield higher billing. As a result, the future of services will rely heavily on a blend of newer tech and human ingenuity, where billability is determined by the premium clients are willing to pay for niche skills rather than volume of resources.TCS has said its restructuring efforts are aimed at making the company future-ready. As part of this initiative, sources told TOI the company has begun focusing on employees who have remained unbilled - commonly referred to as being on the ""bench"" - for extended periods, typically ranging from 3 to 18 months.These individuals, many of whom have between 3 and 10 years of experience with the firm, are being either relocated or let go. This has sparked concerns within the industry over the potential for a wave of sudden and unexpected exits.Several employees who spoke to TOI on condition of anonymity said those impacted had been on the bench for anywhere between 3 and 18 months. In one case, an employee claimed she was called into a meeting where three HR representatives handed her a ""discharge letter"" and asked her to resign. ""It was sudden and shocking. There was no prior intimation,"" she said. TCS, however, maintains that it has consistently offered relocation and retraining options to benched employees to enhance their chances of being deployed on projects.Meanwhile, lateral hires awaiting onboarding have reported uncertainty. In response to one such candidate, a TCS HR executive reportedly said, ""Do not wait for TCS. New announcements are going on. We are helpless,"" suggesting that onboarding timelines are unclear amid ongoing changes.Indian campuses are facing a stark dichotomy - freshers without job offers on one side, and large salary packages on the other. The recent layoffs at TCS have sounded an alarm across the industry. Global capability centres (GCCs) continue to lead recruitment efforts as Indian IT companies adapt to a major transformation in the tech landscape.Even as upskilling becomes part of everyday work life, lower net additions are making engineering graduates anxious. Indian campuses today present a stark contrast: while some students receive lucrative offers, many others are left without any. For computer science students, the future is deeply intertwined with AI, offering exciting opportunities but also demanding rapid adaptation.Ramkumar Ramamoorthy, partner at tech growth advisory firm Catalincs, said, ""In the context of digital and AI, there is a crying need for India to reimagine its higher education to stay relevant. Beyond STEM programmes, we must integrate AI across disciplines - liberal arts, law, medicine, management, and social sciences. The only way to do this at scale is through collaboration with experts and practitioners. Otherwise, we risk producing graduates who are misaligned with market needs, potentially leading to serious social implications.

What is the truth of Julian Brown's 'disappearance'?



Pyrolysis is not something new







21-year-old inventor Julian Brown was reportedly missing days after claiming that he was under attack. The Atlanta inventor has 1.7 million followers on Instagram who raised concerns about the well-being of the TikTok scientist who was making usable gas from plastic. Brown's followers Monday stormed all social media platforms, reporting him missing, urging FBI chief Kash Patel and deputy director Dan Bongino to launch an investigation -- while there was no report of any missing person.Julian Brown disappeared from social media after claiming that he was under attack and some very strange things were happening to him. 'Something is happening, keep me in your prayers please. SCREEN RECORD THIS. I don’t know,' Brown wrote on the post. ""I’m certainly under attack... I can’t go into so much detail,"" Brown said, asking his followers to keep their eyes open.His followers expressed apprehension on social media that he was probably killed, kidnapped or silenced for his invention.But his mother Nia Brown told DailyMail that Julian was safe. He was keeping a low profile for his safety and so she could not reveal any further details about Julian, his location etc.'I can confirm Julian is safe but in the best interest of his security I'm not able to provide any more information,' she said.Experts on social media argued that Julian Brown did not discover anything new. He invented Plastolin a machine for himself that converts plastic waste into fuel. But the process pyrolysis has been known for decades, they said, adding that there is no reason anyone would want to kill Julian Brown.For days, however, Julian Brown built suspense as he said he was being surveilled, he found a secret helicopter circling him in the middle of nowhere.Julian Brown was featured by Forbes as the founder of Naturejab and an innovation in the use of microwave pyrolusts of plastic waste.

KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Ev market share in nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including norway, singapore and ethiopia.

So, readymade garments or home textiles, carpets, handicrafts and traditional items such as pashmina shawls or Kanchipuram or bandhini sarees are expected to gain. India is fourth-largest textile supplier to UK, accounting for over 6% of imports.Government officials said India hopes to outperform competitors such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Cambodia, Turkey and Bangladesh in the footwear market, especially athleisure and sports shoes, in addition to Vellore and Kolhapuri chappals and traditional leather shoes. In recent years, several large sports shoe manufacturers have tied up with Indian producers to make footwear for brands like Puma, Adidas and New Balance for domestic and global markets.There are sectors where India has a large presence in other markets but a limited share of the British market. Indian exporters hope to replace competitors across a variety of engineering goods, including machinery and components, where zero-duty access will be provided to 1,659 items. With exports of $4.3 billion, India holds a small share of the $194 billion machinery imports by British businesses. Govt is projecting to double the value of exports by March 2030.India also has a small share in UK's pharma imports - only $1 billion out of $30 billion in 2024. The govt is eyeing gains in not just generics but also medical devices such as ECG machines and X-ray systems.For chemicals, where India's exports to UK were $570 million last year, the government is betting on a 30-40% jump in the first year itself as over 1,200 chemicals will be given duty-free access. Businesses are eyeing an opportunity in gems and jewellery sector, where exports are now pegged at $940 million.Although government has maintained that it has not opened several critical agricultural sectors such as dairy, apples, edible oil and oats under the Comprehensive Economic & Trade Agreement, it hopes to push Indian grapes, processed food, bakery items and marine products into UK supermarkets.A lot of the market access in these segments will also depend on the quality standards that the UK puts in place and also other trade deals that it enters into in the coming months.","Indian negotiators are targeting labour-intensive goods and services to boost india's tiny 1.9% share of uk imports.
