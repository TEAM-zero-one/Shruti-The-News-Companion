Engineers in governance can shape India’s future: IIT-M director Kamakoti,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/iit-madras-eyes-global-top-50-with-major-expansion-plans/articleshow/122122083.cms,"IIT Madras

has launched the Pragati platform to support students aspiring for the civil services. And how do you see it shaping aspirations beyond tech and corporate careers?

What’s the story behind your ‘One Patent a Day’ initiative? Has it achieved what you set out to do?

You’ve set a goal of incubating 100 startups annually. What structures support this push?

Can you share your vision for the planned sustainability-focused campus in Puducherry?

What’s the thinking behind IIT-Madras setting up international research centres in places like Dubai?

Any final thoughts on what drives this long list of initiatives?

NEW DELHI: As India eyes ambitious developmental goals by 2047, IIT-Madras is redefining its role well beyond the confines of traditional engineering education. From nurturing civil services aspirants through the newly formalised Pragati platform to filing more than one patent a day, incubating over 100 startups annually, and developing a sustainability-focused campus in Puducherry, the institute is expanding its frontiers. In a strategic shift, IIT-Madras is also exploring the establishment of its own medical college — a key step it sees as essential to breaking into the world’s top 50 universities. In this exclusive interview director Professor V Kamakoti lays out the institute’s broad vision, including its international research centres in Dubai, Malaysia, and Germany, and why technocrats must help shape India’s governance and innovation ecosystem to Manash Pratim Gohain.Professor V Kamakoti: Governance today is inseparable from technology. Look at national missions like Quantum, Cyber-Physical Systems, or Jal Jeevan—every one of them is tech-heavy. Engineers in civil services can help conceive and deliver policies that are interdisciplinary and effective.The idea began with a conversation with an alumnus who became Tamil Nadu’s DGP and came back for a PhD while in service. We held a weekend session and simply circulated a Google form.To our surprise, 350 students showed up—including BTechs, MTechs, and PhDs. The hall couldn’t hold them all. That’s when we knew it needed formal structure.Through Pragati, we’ve institutionalised study groups, peer learning, and mentoring. We’re also aligning electives in social sciences and general studies with civil services needs. The idea is to get talented technocrats into public service early—when they’re full of energy—and let them grow into leadership roles over decades.Kamakoti: Absolutely. This was about creating a culture of invention. With 600+ faculty and 12,000 students, even if a few percent file IPs annually, we’re already ahead. In 2023-24, we filed 417 intellectual property claims — averaging 1.2 a day.It’s also about confidence. We tell students: your ideas are valuable. Many of our major donors — over Rs 300 crore in commitments last year — are alumni entrepreneurs, not employees. They created wealth through innovation. It’s proof that patenting can lead to entrepreneurship and long-term prosperity.Kamakoti: We’ve built a full stack: from the Entrepreneurship Cell and C5, to the Nirman pre-incubator, and then on to our Research Park incubation ecosystem, which includes verticals like health tech, fintech, and rural innovation.We’ve introduced system-level thinking courses for BTech students from their second year onward. Postgraduates come with research ideas, and we help them convert those into startups. Last year, we incubated 103 startups, many of them deep-tech, like Agnikul, which is building launch vehicles for satellites, and Agnirath, our solar-powered racing car team competing in Australia.These aren’t small-time ventures — they are solving global, high-impact challenges.Kamakoti: Sustainability is now a key metric in global rankings, and more importantly, it’s essential for planetary survival. We've launched the School of Sustainability under our School of Interdisciplinary Studies.The new campus in Puducherry will be entirely focused on research aligned with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We are collaborating with Auroville and other local partners. Research there will focus on green construction, zero-emission technologies, renewable energy, and more. Every aspect of the campus will itself be a sustainability model.This is our contribution to “One Earth, One Family, One Future” — a vision also highlighted by our Prime Minister during the G20 summit.Kamakoti: Global expansion is necessary if we want Indian institutions to break into the world’s top 50. The top-ranked universities all have global campuses, deep research collaborations, and — critically — medical schools. We are actively working in that direction.As I’ve said If you really want to come to the top 50 (in global rankings), you must have a medical school. That’s the hard truth. So yes, we’re studying how to eventually integrate a medical school into our institution. This would be closely linked with engineering and science, enabling translational research, biotech innovations, and advanced healthcare solutions.Our international expansion under IITM Global is another pillar of this effort. After launching the Zanzibar campus, we’re now planning research centres in Dubai, Malaysia, and Germany. These won’t just be teaching outposts — they will drive local problem-solving and joint innovation. We’re laying the groundwork for IIT-Madras to become a truly global institution.Kamakoti: Simple — India is at a unique inflection point. We have the brains, the demographics, and now, the infrastructure. Our role as an institution is to empower, enable, and energise. Whether it’s a civil servant, an inventor, a founder, or a sustainability scientist, we want every student to leave here with the conviction: I can build something that matters.","Iit madras has launched the pragati platform to support students aspiring for the civil services.

Microsoft sued by authors for allegedly using pirated books to train AI model,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/microsoft-sued-by-authors-for-allegedly-using-pirated-books-to-train-ai-model/articleshow/122088854.cms,"Authors accuse Microsoft of copyright infringement

Lawsuit demands damages and a court injunction

Legal backdrop: A turning point in AI copyright battles

Microsoft yet to respond publicly

A growing challenge for the AI industry





A group of prominent authors, including Pulitzer Prize winner Kai Bird and New Yorker writer Jia Tolentino, has filed a lawsuit against Microsoft, accusing the tech giant of illegally using pirated versions of their books to train its AI model known as “Megatron. ” Filed in a New York federal court on June 25, the suit claims that Microsoft copied nearly 200,000 copyrighted works without permission to develop AI systems that mimic the authors’ unique writing styles, themes, and voices. This marks another major legal challenge in the growing debate over AI training and copyright law.The plaintiffs allege that Microsoft used a massive dataset of pirated digital books to train Megatron, a generative AI model designed to produce human-like text. According to the complaint, the AI’s ability to replicate the tone, syntax, and narrative patterns of copyrighted works demonstrates a clear violation of intellectual property rights. The authors argue that their creative output was exploited to build a product that competes with them in the marketplace, without their consent or compensation.The writers are seeking statutory damages of up to $150,000 per infringed work, along with a court order to block Microsoft from continuing its alleged unauthorised use of their materials.While the exact number of infringed titles remains unclear, the plaintiffs claim that thousands of authors’ works may have been used without licence or attribution. The case could set a precedent for how courts handle AI training involving copyrighted content.This lawsuit comes just one day after a California judge ruled that AI firm Anthropic may have made “fair use” of copyrighted material in training but could still be liable for using pirated versions of books. It was the first US decision to address the legality of using copyrighted texts in generative AI development. The Microsoft case adds further momentum to a wave of lawsuits from writers, artists, and media outlets challenging how their work is used by tech companies.According to Reuters, Microsoft has not issued an official response to the allegations. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment when contacted by reporters. Meanwhile, legal observers say this case will be closely watched for its implications on the future of AI development and intellectual property rights.Tech firms including Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic have all faced similar legal scrutiny in recent time. The central argument from the companies is that using public data for AI training qualifies as “fair use” under US copyright law. However, rights holders argue that this approach undermines creators' control and devalues their work. As AI models become increasingly sophisticated, courts should define clearer boundaries around what constitutes ethical and legal data usage.",Authors accuse microsoft of copyright infringement.

A spiritual path grounded in scientific wisdom



Gauranga Das’s unique approach to leadership



Books that bridge the gap between worlds



The Art of Resilience

The Art of Focus

In a moment that appealed to seekers of spirituality as well as tech enthusiasts, there was an unforgettable exchange between Google CEO Sundar Pichai and ISKCON monk Gauranga Das at the India Global Forum 2025 in London. The discussion between them, which had started lively with a jocular remark about being youthful, soon turned into an introspective discussion on the stark contrast between corporate stress and spiritual tranquility.Gauranga Das, a graduate from IIT Bombay, who now heads programs in sustainable living and spiritual education, used the moment to highlight some of the most pressing concerns of our digital times - mental health and the increasing digital addiction epidemic.The difference between these two IIT graduates was more than physical or professional; it was philosophical. While one sits at the head of one of the most influential tech giants in the world, the other has dedicated his life to leading people to inner understanding and spiritual direction. The meeting wasn't merely a reunion; it was a comparison of two radically different directions based on the same intellectual heritage. It was an effective metaphor for the decisions contemporary society must make today: progress without equilibrium, or innovation backed by internal wellness.Gauranga Das and Sundar Pichai, though having started at the same time at IIT, followed different career paths early on in life. Pichai went into technology and became the CEO of Google, a company that is at the heart of the digital revolution. Das instead went down the path of spiritual discovery and service, becoming an ISKCON member and dedicating himself to bringing ancient wisdom into modern settings.Their meeting at the India Global Forum 2025 was noticed when Pichai noted the way young Gauranga Das looked compared to his age. Das responded with an answer that went viral instantly for its simplicity and profundity:This one sentence highlighted a wider discussion regarding what it means to live from purpose rather than performance. It also spawned a wider debate regarding how spiritual tools can assist with coping with rising levels of stress inflicted as a result of round-the-clock digital interaction.In his address to the forum, Gauranga Das reported shocking statistics regarding digital addiction, specifically social media. Based on the information he provided, more than 230 million individuals globally are addicted to social media. In India alone, 70% of adolescents spend as much as seven hours per day on the net, a figure that indicates increasing worry for parents, teachers, and mental health professionals.Das linked these figures to the wider problem of declining mental health worldwide. Referring to world trends, he identified that one in seven individuals is presently suffering from some sort of mental health difficulty. These are anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and chronic stress; maladies that are increasingly being attributed to excessive exposure to digital content and a mindfulness deficit in daily life.This was not simply an attack on technology, but a call to awaken to how we engage with it. Das leveraged the platform to promote a more holistic digital life, one that includes frequent breaks, mindful use, and spiritual anchoring.Gauranga Das is not only a monk who has spiritual wisdom; he is also an engineer who has been trained and who has a deep understanding of how technology functions and how it may affect human psychology. This makes him uniquely qualified in matters that lie at the interface between science and spirituality.Das is also a senior member of the Governing Body Commission of ISKCON and the director of Govardhan Ecovillage (GEV), a green living community that was established under the inspiration of Radhanath Swami. GEV is not only an ashram, it is a widely acclaimed model of how to apply ancient wisdom to modern sustainability practices. It won the UN World Tourism Organization Award in 2017, and it is also accredited with key United Nations organisations such as UNEP, ECOSOC, UNCCD, and CBD.Under Das's stewardship, GEV has turned into an exemplar of the way communities can be in harmony with nature yet maintain essential spiritual principles. It should not be astonishing that numerous young professionals, such as engineers, physicians, and policy makers, now journey to the Ecovillage for leadership training and retreats.Aside from his work in the Ecovillage, Gauranga Das also heads the Govardhan School of Public Leadership, an institution that prepares wannabe civil servants of India. The founder created the school to develop resilient leaders imbued with ethical values by the integration of Vedic wisdom alongside contemporary public policy training.Das also leads the Bhaktivedanta Research Centre, where ancient manuscripts are kept, translated, and analysed in academic contexts. This centre offers postgraduate studies in philosophy and comparative religion, providing students access to systems of knowledge that are both ancient and extremely useful today. The curriculum combines ancient insights with modern administrative frameworks, helping students navigate complexity, uncertainty, and moral dilemmas in real-world governance and social impact roles.Through such platforms, Das prioritises staying resilient, focused, and mentally clear; qualities that are typically undervalued in demanding corporate settings but are key to sustained success and satisfaction.To make spiritual insights more common, Gauranga Das has written two influential books:Both books borrow from scriptures such as the Bhagavad Gita but touch on very contemporary issues like office burnout, distraction, and individual discontentment. These books have spoken to spiritual seekers as well as working professionals seeking down-to-earth, real-life counsel on surviving life's stress.In interviews and talks, Das has consistently emphasised that spiritual tools are not exclusive to monks or renunciants. They are equally relevant to CEOs, students, and anyone navigating the complexities of modern life.","Sundar pichai's iit batchmate gauranga das who turned'monk' looks younger than him; his reason: 'you deal with google, i deal with god' 70% of indian teens spend 7 hours online: iskcon monk warns of mental health fallout.

Instagram war explodes as Jordon Hudson exposes Linda Holliday’s 'delusional' letter to Bill Belichick



Things are heating up off the football field for former New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick, but this time, the drama isn’t about playbooks—it’s about a fiery love triangle making waves on social media. His current girlfriend, 24-year-old pageant contestant Jordon Hudson, has allegedly taken direct aim at his longtime ex-partner Linda Holliday in a now-viral Instagram exchange.According to the Daily Mail, Hudson was engaged in a heated back-and-forth with someone she believed to be close to Holliday. The argument ignited when the woman allegedly branded Hudson a “gold digger” and accused her of taking advantage of the 73-year-old NFL legend. Hudson, however, did not hold back in her response and delivered a blistering message that included references to a letter Holliday wrote to Belichick nearly a decade ago.“Hey babes! Since you are tight with Ms Holliday, would you please ask her what she would like me to do with this letter I found from 2015?” Hudson reportedly wrote in a message shared via screenshot. She added, “Due to its pathetic and embarrassing content, I imagine she wants it back.She should make the point to burn it so she continue [sic] to live in delusional denial.”The letter in question was supposedly found by Hudson at Belichick’s $2.2 million Hingham home in an old invoice file. In it, Holliday had allegedly poured out her frustrations over being excluded from aspects of Belichick’s life and his ongoing loyalty to ex-wife Debbie Clarke. Holliday had written, “I’m the one that loves and adores you... tries to ALWAYS remind you how grateful I am of your love,” expressing feelings of being sidelined in favor of Clarke, despite her love and commitment to the coach.Belichick and Holliday were together for 16 years before parting ways in 2023. Shortly after, Belichick's romance with Hudson became public. The couple reportedly first met on a flight in 2021 and have since been spotted attending high-profile events, including the NFL Honors.But Hudson's entry into Belichick's world has been far from seamless. Page Six reports that she has been “iced out” by Nantucket’s elite social scene—where Holliday remains a central figure. Her growing influence in Belichick’s post-Patriots chapter has raised eyebrows too, especially after she was seen on the field at UNC, where Belichick has taken a new role. Some reports suggest she’s even being looped into work emails and possibly pitching involvement in media projects like Hard Knocks.Despite the noise, Belichick has publicly defended Hudson, stating she leads his “professional opportunities” outside UNC. Whether this storm settles or intensifies remains to be seen—but one thing is clear: this isn’t your typical offseason drama.Also Read: How Tom Brady and Gisele Bündchen built their marriage on trust and acceptance of each other’s pasts?","Bill belichick's current girlfriend, 24-year-old pageant contestant jordon hudson, has allegedly taken direct aim at his longtime ex-partner linda holliday in a now-viral instagram exchange.

Not many people think twice about their passport—until they’re applying for one. Whether travelling abroad for a dream vacation, a foreign career, or an unexpected crisis, the process can be either smooth sailing or a nightmare. In the last decade, however, India's passport operations have undergone a quiet revolution in the background.On June 24, 2025, on the occasion of the observance of the 13th Passport Seva Divas, External Affairs Minister Dr. S. Jaishankar recognised this change. His speech wasn't merely formal. It was a straightforward assessment of how technology, governance, and public service have converged to impact actual people daily.In a social media update on X, Dr. Jaishankar expressed gratitude to passport officials, both in India and posted overseas, for what he labelled as a ""remarkable transformation"" in service delivery. He associated the program with three pillars: Seva (service), Sushasan (good governance), and Garib Kalyan (welfare). For the minister, these concepts are no longer theoretical—they're being implemented through services such as the Passport Seva Programme.The passport application process in India was all about delays, red tape, and queuing up for years. The picture has changed dramatically now. The Passport Seva Programme (PSP), initiated by the Ministry of External Affairs, has gradually revolutionised the way individuals apply for, obtain, and renew their passports.Dr. Jaishankar said the PSP is an expression of the government's overall vision of a ""Viksit Bharat"", a developed India with technology and governance aligned to better serve citizens. To say it in his own words, ""Seva, Sushasan and Garib Kalyan are three major pillars of governance that would take us to a Viksit Bharat. They are all expressed with prominence in our Passport Seva Programme.""This scheme is not limited to cities alone. It has spread its wings to Tier 3 and Tier 2 towns and districts with Post Office Passport Seva Kendras (POPSKs), so that first-time applicants, migrant labourers, and students in Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities can avail of passport facilities without having to travel long distances.What was once seen as a long, often frustrating ordeal has now become a smoother and more accessible process. People are able to schedule appointments with ease, receive timely updates, and walk into clean, well-managed centres with helpful staff.Among the largest announcements this year is the country-wide introduction of e-Passports. They're not new passports with a new cover, they're embedded with a microchip bearing critical personal and biometric information.Here's what makes them different:The technology used is no different from that which is already common in most developed nations, bringing India's passport program to par with the best worldwide.e-Passports have several practical advantages:As per the latest updates from the Ministry of External Affairs, e-passports are issued phase-wise and in the next few years will become the norm for all new applicants.One of the more frustrating parts of applying for a passport has always been the police verification process. Depending on the location, this step could delay an application by weeks.In order to mitigate that, the Ministry of External Affairs launched the mPassport Police App, a mobile app now being used by the police in 25 states and Union Territories. As per the official update in the Ministry, the app has managed to decrease verification timelines to a mere 5 to 7 days in most regions.Police officers currently get electronic notifications, can upload proof of information at the scene, and transmit real-time updates to passport offices. This not only enhances speed but also avoids paperwork by hand and follow-up delays.For students, working professionals, and first-time applicants, this alone has made the whole process much more certain and less stressful.If you want to know how to obtain an e-passport, the procedure is not that different from obtaining a normal one. Here's how you do it:Following this, you will be able to follow up on your passport online until it arrives via post.","S.s. jaishankar launches passport seva 2.0 in india.

Investment will continue, with or without Microsoft: Softbank CEO

SoftBank is ‘all in’ on ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. CEO and Founder Masayoshi Son said the company is betting heavily on the artificial intelligence (AI) company, with planned investments worth 4.8 trillion Japanese yen (around $33.2 billion). Son said he believes OpenAI, currently unlisted and not profitable, will eventually become “the most valuable company in the world.” Speaking at a shareholder meeting, Son said SoftBank’s long-term goal is to play a leading role in the era of artificial superintelligence (ASI)—a concept he described as AI that is 10,000 times smarter than humans. The Japanese tech conglomerate has been expanding its partnership with OpenAI this year, including joining the $500 billion Stargate project.During the meeting, Son also revealed that OpenAI CEO Sam Altman had once asked SoftBank for a $10 billion investment before Microsoft signed its now well-known partnership with the AI firm. “I said, yes, I would,” Son told shareholders. But Altman eventually went with Microsoft.Microsoft recently lost its exclusive cloud provider status with OpenAI and hasn’t approved a reported restructuring plan to make OpenAI a traditional for-profit company.Despite the changing relationship between Microsoft and OpenAI, Son said SoftBank’s commitment remains firm. The company earlier stated it might reduce its stake if OpenAI doesn’t restructure by December 31, but Son clarified on Friday that their support will continue “regardless of what happens with Microsoft.”Son said OpenAI is key to SoftBank’s vision of building the world’s largest ASI platform. He reportedly aims for the company to become the “organizer of the industry in the artificial superintelligence era” within the next decade.SoftBank owns Arm, the UK-based chip company, and recently acquired U.S.-based chip designer Ampere for $6.5 billion. It is also reportedly exploring the creation of a $1 trillion AI-focused industrial complex in the United States.","Softbank ceo masayoshi son said the company is betting heavily on the artificial intelligence (ai) company.

USCIS advises users to save its new number – 872466 in their contacts to avoid confusion or mistaking the messages for spam.Having said that, there is no change in the type of messages sent.

‘It's not too late to change course’: Bill Gates

How to detect hidden cameras in a hotel room, just with your smartphone

Microsoft founder and former CEO Bill Gates has once again raised concerns over the impact of US government cutting funding for global health. Sharing a post on microblogging platform X (formerly Twitter), he warned that this could result in an additional 8 million child deaths by 2024. Gates cited a Lancet study on the cumulative impact of reductions in American aid. “It found that, by 2040, 8 million more children will die before their fifth birthday. To give some context for 8 million: That's how many children live in California, Texas, Florida, New York, Pennsylvania, and Ohio combined,” Gates said.In the post, he writes “When the United States and other governments suddenly cut their aid budgets, I know for a fact that more children will die.”He said he has worked in the global health space for over 25 years and has seen how important aid is in saving lives. “Over the past 25 years—the same span of time I spent leading Microsoft—I have immersed myself in global health: building knowledge, deepening expertise, and working to save lives from deadly diseases and preventable causes. During that time, I have built teams of world-class scientists and public health experts at the Gates Foundation , studied health systems across continents, and worked in close partnership with national and local leaders to strengthen the delivery of lifesaving care,” he writes.“Global health aid saves lives. And when that aid is withdrawn—abruptly and without a plan—lives are lost,” Gates warned. “At this point, I know as much about improving health in poor countries as I do about software,” he further stated.Microsoft founder Bill Gates said that U.S. cuts to global health aid are already causing problems. He pointed out that important programs like tuberculosis testing and malaria prevention are slowing down, and life-saving medicines are getting delayed.Gates recently visited Nigeria and Ethiopia and said he saw for himself how healthcare services there are being affected by the funding cuts.Still, Gates said there is time to fix the situation. “It’s not too late to change course,” he wrote on X. He urged the U.S. Congress to restore funding for major programs such as PEPFAR (the U.S. plan for AIDS relief) and the Global Fund.",Microsoft founder and former ceo bill gates has once again raised concerns over the impact of us government cutting funding for global health.

After a chastening crackdown that wiped billions off their value and forced top executives out of the public eye, China's technology giants are back in favour and on the front foot, making deals and snapping up assets.At the top of the pile are Alibaba Group and Tencent , two huge players that used to compete for acquisitions until their wings were clipped by Chinese authorities concerned about their wide and powerful reach.

The UAE job market in 2025 is evolving amid economic shifts and global uncertainties, with hiring showing signs of both caution and opportunity. As reported by local news outlet, Gulf News, demand for skilled professionals remains strong in sectors like construction, banking, and technology, but overall hiring has slowed entering the second half of the year. This slowdown is largely due to new corporate tax pressures and unclear economic conditions, which have caused many companies to postpone major recruitment decisions until after Q4 2025, when tax filings clarify plans for 2026. AI and automation are also reshaping roles, prompting employers to take a more measured approach to hiring.Despite these challenges, sectors such as transport and logistics continue to offer promising openings. Amid this cautious environment, government jobs stand out as particularly attractive to expats, offering stability, benefits, and competitive pay. Dubai is actively recruiting experienced expatriates through its official portal, dubaicareers.ae, where a range of positions are available, some with salaries reaching up to Dh50,000 per month.This reflects a strategic shift: while the UAE has traditionally focused on Emirati talent in public service, the current recruitment drive highlights the value placed on global expertise to support Dubai’s ambitions in urban planning, healthcare, digital infrastructure, aviation safety, and cultural preservation. Contrary to myths about summer hiring freezes, government recruitment often continues or even intensifies during this period.This approach offers expatriates not just jobs, but careers with purpose, stability, and attractive compensation. Below is a list of 10 Dubai government jobs currently open for expats across multiple sectors:These positions provide diverse opportunities within government and public sectors, prioritizing UAE nationals while offering salaries that are competitive and based on experience and qualifications.","Despite slower private-sector hiring, dubai’s government continues recruiting skilled global talent and expats across sectors like healthcare, urban planning, and transport.

While global attention often lingers on freight disruptions and shipping capacity, a more transformational shift is quietly unfolding between India and the United Arab Emirates. The two economies are not simply moving more goods—they are reimagining the infrastructure that enables it. At the center of this transformation is the India–Dubai corridor—where bilateral investments, joint digital systems, and co-developed logistics hubs are setting a new benchmark for regional trade cooperation.From deep-sea ports in Gujarat to dry port ecosystems in Maharashtra, and from Dubai’s electric vehicle–equipped logistics hubs to shared cargo visibility platforms, a next-generation trade corridor is taking shape. This is not just about improving trade. It is about engineering interdependence through concrete, code, and coordinated policy.In January 2025, DP World confirmed a $2.5 billionglobal investment package, with a significant share allocated to Indian logistics partnerships and multimodal corridors connecting the subcontinent to the UAE. “This US$ $2.5 billion commitment reflects our confidence in long-term trade growth and our determination to build the infrastructure needed to keep the world connected,” H.E. Sultan Ahmed bin Sulayem, Group Chairman and CEO of DP World, had then emphasised.The Tuna Tekra terminal in Gujarat, developed in partnership with Adani Ports, is a flagship project. The facility includes a 1.1-kilometre berth, advanced handling equipment, and direct rail access to India’s Western Dedicated Freight Corridor. It is already being positioned as a key node for cargo headed toward the Middle East, Africa, and Europe.“Gujarat’s port infrastructure is no longer just for maritime throughput—it’s becoming a base for integrated, value-added logistics,” said an official at India’s Ministry of Ports.On the other side of the Arabian Sea, Jebel Ali Port continues to evolve. With over 1,000 Indian companiesoperating out of its Free Zone, and increasing warehousing demand from Indian exporters of electronics, textiles, and pharmaceuticals, Dubai’s role is shifting from a gateway to a collaborative hub. This deepening integration between Indian exporters and Dubai’s multimodal logistics network is now being reinforced by a shared emphasis on sustainability and innovation—marking a new phase in the bilateral trade journey.Sustainability is no longer a talking point—it is a design principle. At JNPT, India’s busiest container port, a $131 millionmodernisation initiative funded by the Asian Development Bank is installing electric cranes, upgrading yards, and integrating solar energy into port operations.“Enhancing trade infrastructure is no longer about volume alone. It’s about climate resilience, smart energy, and urban integration,” said Ashok Lavasa, Vice-President for Private Sector Operations and Public–Private Partnerships – Asian Development Bank (ADB)Across the Gulf, DP World’s Jebel Ali Port is deploying AI-enabled route planning for electric terminal vehicles. The model draws on lessons from the company’s Callao port in Peru, where EV deployment saved 2,400 tonnesof CO₂ in just over a year.India’s Jalna Dry Port in Maharashtra is another vital node in the corridor. Once operational, it will process up to 10 million TEUs annually, directly linking central India’s industries to global export lanes via JNPT and Tuna Tekra.“India’s freight corridors and dry port ecosystems are starting to mirror the integrated logistics we’ve built in Dubai—tailored for domestic scale and rural access,” said a DP World infrastructure planner involved in Indian operations.Dubai is responding in kind. The Roads and Transport Authorityhas announced feasibility studies to build inland consolidation hubs based on India’s Jalna and Dadri dry port models, aimed at decentralising last-mile freight.Digital transformation is perhaps the most forward-looking development. In Q1 2025, Indian Customs and Dubai’s Ports, Customs and Free Zone Corporation began piloting a joint cargo visibility platform. The blockchain-enabled dashboard allows real-time tracking from Indian factories to UAE warehouses. It also integrates customs clearances, container scans, and CO₂ footprint calculators. Industry leaders such as Soham Chokshi, CEO & Co-Founder of Shipsy, emphasise that digital visibility and automation are now mission-critical for SMEs exporting through corridors like India–Dubai, driving both reliability and sustainability.On digitalisation and future-ready shipping, the Union Minister reiterated how it is the core strategy of India’s maritime policy. India’s naval policies, such as ONOP, NLP (Marine), and MAITRI, are streamlining port services, reducing transaction times, and enabling real-time data. India is also partnering with the UAE and Singapore to create Virtual Trade Corridors for seamless cargo movement.“India’s maritime vision, rooted in ‘’, promotes collaboration and shared prosperity. As a reliable and responsible partner, India is committed to building a green, secure, and inclusive maritime future,” said Union Minister Sarbananda Sonowal.Meanwhile, DP World has begun rolling out digital twin technology in terminals at Nhava Sheva and Mundra, following successful deployments at London Gateway and Constanța. These simulations help ports optimise traffic flows, test maintenance windows, and reduce idle time for container lifts.What’s unfolding is not merely an exchange of goods—it’s a shared blueprint for long-term infrastructure reliability and strategic cooperation. For India, it means access to high-performing logistics frameworks. For Dubai, it strengthens its position as a global distribution centre for South Asian exports into Africa, Europe, and the wider Middle East.Click this link for more on Business in Dubai.",A transformational shift is quietly unfolding between india and the united arab emirates.

"Elon Musk disagrees with PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel’s comparison of AI and ‘90s internet, Tesla CEO says, ‘I do think…’",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/social/elon-musk-disagrees-with-paypal-co-founder-peter-thiels-comparison-of-ai-and-90s-internet-tesla-ceo-says-i-do-think/articleshow/122138353.cms,"What Elon Musk said about Thiel’s ‘AI assessment’

""I do think AI and robotics will lead to a surplus and massively increased economy in 10 years.""

“I think Peter’s guess is low by a large margin.”

What Peter Thiel said about AI’s impact on economy

“Well, I don't know. There are a lot of layers to this. One question we can frame is: Just how big a thing do I think A.I. is? And my stupid answer is: It's more than a nothing burger, and it's less than the total transformation of our society. My placeholder is that it's roughly on the scale of the internet in the late '90s. I'm not sure it's enough to really end the stagnation. It might be enough to create some great companies. And the internet added maybe a few percentage points to the maybe 1% to GDP growth every year for 10, 15 years. It added some to productivity. So that's roughly my placeholder for AI.”

“I had a conversation with Elon a few weeks ago about this. He said we're going to have a billion humanoid robots in the U.S. in 10 years. And I said: Well, if that's true, you don't need to worry about the budget deficits because we're going to have so much growth, the growth will take care of this. And then — well, he's still worried about the budget deficits. This doesn't prove that he doesn't believe in the billion robots, but it suggests that maybe he hasn't thought it through or that he doesn't think it's going to be as transformative economically, or that there are big error bars around it. But yeah, there's some way in which these things are not quite thought through.”

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has publicly disagreed with PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel's assessment of AI’s impact on the economy. Thiel, who co-founded the online payments service with Musk, compared the scale of AI's impact on the economy to that of the internet in the late 1990s. However, Musk believes AI's transformative power on the economy will be significantly higher. A recent post shared by a user on the social media platform X (earlier Twitter) includes a transcript of Thiel’s thoughts, where he says his “placeholder is that it's roughly on the scale of the internet in the late '90s.” He also suggested AI may “add maybe a few percentage points to maybe 1% to GDP growth every year for 10, 15 years.""Replying to the thread of posts, Musk countered,Earlier, Musk replied to the first transcript, saying,In the transcription shared on the X post, Thiel said:In the same thread, the user also shared another transcript where Thiel mentioned discussing this topic with the world’s richest man.In this transcript, Thiel noted:",Peter thiel compared the scale of ai's impact on the economy to that of the internet in the late 1990s.
