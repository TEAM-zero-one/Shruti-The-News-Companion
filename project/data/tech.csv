IAF Workhorse MiG-21 Makes Last Sorties At Nal Ahead Of Sept 26 Chandigarh Farewell

NEW DELHI: Air Chief Marshal A P Singh on Tuesday cautioned against rushing the rollout of theatre commands, stressing that India must adopt its own model instead of copying others. He suggested setting up a joint planning and coordination centre in Delhi, under the Chiefs of Staff Committee, to prepare for ""future wars.""Speaking at the Army War College, the Chief of Air Staff, cautioned against rushing into the creation of new theatre commands, warning that creating a new structure while disrupting everything is not a very good idea at this point of time.Instead, he proposed setting up a joint planning and coordination centre in Delhi, placed under the Chiefs of Staff Committee, to issue directions jointly saying, ""I personally feel that having a joint planning and coordination centre in Delhi is what is required.""Responding to questions on the proposed theatre commands, Singh said, ""yes, we can start with this first, implement it and see how it pans out. If we need any more structure, we can think about it. But disrupting everything and making one structure now at this time, I do not think it is a very good idea.""The Air Chief Marshal's remarks came three-and-a-half months after Operation Sindoor, which showcased strong coordination among the Army, Navy and Air Force.Citing the recent Operation Sindoor, a tri-service simulation held from May 7 to 10 against Pakistan, Singh underlined how the three service chiefs worked closely in planning and execution.The exercise, he said, reinforced both the primacy of air power and the value of coordination. He further noted that ""centrally planned"" decisions could still be executed in a decentralised framework, which in his view ""will work out the best.""He also cautioned against blindly following international models saying India should not be inspired by any other country, like the US, in rolling out theatre commands, stressing that the nation must design a framework suited to its own requirements.""Everybody has their own requirements. We need to think about what we need there, and then only we should go about it. Otherwise, we will go wrong,"" he said.""We should not just come under any pressure and say we have to implement it now. Somehow, we have to do it. It should not be done this way. I think we can stand our ground and discuss things,"" he added.The Air Force chief also underlined the need to focus on preparing for tomorrow's wars, where clarity in the chain of command will be critical.""You cannot have a theatre commander sitting somewhere... now whom they talk to, where do they get directions from. Phones are available but generally that does not work like that,"" he said.""I feel having joint planning and coordination at the apex level is what is required. If directions go from it, things will work out. We don't actually need another structure at the lower level,"" Singh added.The government’s proposed theaterisation model aims to bring the three services under unified commands to better integrate capabilities and use resources more effectively.Under the plan, each theatre command would combine units of the Army, Navy and Air Force to handle security challenges in a specific region. Currently, the three services operate under separate commands.","Air chief marshal a p singh on tuesday cautioned against rushing the rollout of theatre commands.

No high power 5G antennae near runways as DoT issues safety guidelines based on DGCA recco,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/no-high-power-5g-antennae-near-runways-as-dot-issues-safety-guidelines-based-on-dgca-recco/articleshow/123533331.cms,"AI image

New Delhi: Govt Tuesday directed telecommunications service providers (TSP) to “implement exclusion zones in and around airports for installation and operation of C band 5G international mobile telecom stations” to avoid potentially catastrophic interference from 5G signals to aircraft systems — including radio altimeters that measure a plane’s aircraft's height above the terrain directly below it. This essentially means TSPs will have to install low power 5G antennae near runways to avoid string signals causing interference with aircraft systems.The Union aviation ministry and the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) had last Nov suggested revised exclusion zones for ensuring safe landings and take offs. “The matter has been under deliberation of the department of telecommunications (DoT), civil aviation (ministry or MoCA) and DGCA.. the revised exclusion zones recommended (by) MoCA have been agreed as an interim measure till the upgradation or retrofitting of radio altimeters,” a DoT order issued Tuesday said.People in the know said aviation agencies in India had objected to rollout of 5G near airports due to aviation safety reasons. A radio altimeter giving a wrong reading can even lead to a crash. A paper by Boeing titled “5G radio altimeter interference” says: “Governments around the world are implementing 5G cellular systems in frequency ranges adjacent to or near the radio frequency band used by radio altimeters.The aviation industry and aviation regulators are concerned these 5G deployments will cause interference to radio altimeters… Concerns are based on a study done by industry and the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) (which) concluded 5G transmissions can interfere with radio altimeters. ” As a result of this study, alerts for 5G interference were issued by the Civil Aviation Authorities of France, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Czech Republic, Saudi Arabia, Oman and UAE.Several advanced countries have safeguards for this with rules from the US Federal Aviation Administration and the European and European Union Aviation Safety Agency. India will also have similar safeguards and as an interim measure there will not be high powered 5G antennae near runways,” they said.The aviation authorities in India suggested an “envelope” near runways and prescribed the minimum distance at which certain low powered 5G antennae can be installed. The DoT order issued Tuesday to Bharti Airtel, Reliance Jio, Vodafone and BSNL added, “Hence, (an earlier) DoT letter is suppressed and the exclusion zones (no C band and buffer zones) stands revised. TSPs are permitted to install and operate C band 5G/IMT services in frequency band 3300- 3670 MHz in and around airport areas as per the revised exclusion zone and technical conditions. ”",Govt tuesday directed telecommunications service providers to “implement exclusion zones in and around airports for installation and operation of c band 5g international mobile telecom stations” this essentially means tsps will have to install low power 5g antennae near runways to avoid string signals causing interference with aircraft systems.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123533396,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-108296,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Hansalpur: PM Narendra Modi Tuesday said India was prioritising 'Mission Manufacturing' that aimed to make local production more efficient and globally competitive, adding the focus would be on strengthening ease of doing business and building capacity in ""futuristic industries"" such as semiconductors and rare earth magnets.""India is working to make its manufacturing sector efficient and globally competitive. Industrial corridors are being developed to support this vision as well as plug-and-play infrastructure and logistics parks are being established across the country... manufacturers in several sectors are being provided benefits under the production linked incentive scheme,"" he said in Gujarat while flagging off Suzuki Motor and Maruti's first EV.Modi said the Centre and the states needed to focus on reforms to attract investors. He said past reforms gave an impetus in sectors such as electronics and defence. ""These reforms have made it easier for investors to invest in Indian manufacturing... In this decade alone, electronics production in India has increased by nearly 500% (and) mobile phone production has surged by up to 2,700% while defence production has witnessed a growth of over 200%.The PM said states should compete on ushering reforms to attract new investments.Laying out a roadmap for India's industrial growth and its global stride, Modi said the goal should be to build on efficiencies, apart from a focus on engaging in cutting-edge technologies. ""India will not stop here; in sectors where India has performed well, the goal is to achieve even greater excellence,"" he said.""India's focus will now shift towards futuristic industries,"" Modi said, talking about the strides in the semiconductor industry.The PM also said govt was ""attentive to the challenges"" faced by the auto industry due to shortages of rare earth magnets. ""To strengthen national capabilities in this area, we have the National Critical Mineral Mission. Under this mission, over 1,200 exploratory campaigns will be conducted across various locations in India to identify critical minerals.""Modi said the Suzuki eVitara would be exported to over 100 countries and emerge as a showcase project for the country's global manufacturing prowess. ""A new chapter is being added to India's ' Make in India ' journey. This marks a significant leap towards the shared goal of 'Make in India, Make for the World',"" he said.","Modi said the centre and the states needed to focus on reforms to attract investors.

The resurfaced tweets and Josh Allen’s apology



The road forward for Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld

Josh Allen and Hailee Steinfeld’s marriage was expected to be one of the most glamorous celebrity-athlete unions of the year. Their wedding photos painted a picture of a fairytale romance — but celebrations quickly collided with controversy. Old tweets from Allen’s teenage years resurfaced, sparking renewed debate about accountability, personal growth, and how much the past should define public figures.Among the most damaging posts was the statement: “If it ain’t white, it ain’t right.” The tweets, made when Allen was 14 or 15, initially resurfaced back in 2018 but gained traction again during the wedding.Allen had already apologized to ESPN, saying: “I’m in a panic…I apologize for what I did… That is not who I am.” He explained that some tweets were immature attempts to mimic lyrics or jokes, while others may have come from friends using his phone. Still, the phrasing and tone stirred backlash.Fans and analysts remain split. Some argue the quarterback should not be endlessly punished for mistakes made as a teenager, especially after public apologies and years of clean conduct. Others believe that such comments reveal underlying attitudes that demand more direct confrontation.Within the NFL , several teammates have spoken up for Allen’s character, noting that his actions as a leader show growth, while critics caution against excusing harmful words simply because of athletic talent.For Allen and Steinfeld, this controversy tests how they will navigate scrutiny as a high-profile couple. Many believe the quarterback has an opportunity to go beyond apologies — using his platform to promote dialogue, education, and anti-racism initiatives.Also Read: Hailee Steinfeld stuns fans in chocolate brown leather outfit as Josh Allen prepares for the NFL season If handled thoughtfully, the couple could turn a negative moment into one that underscores accountability and maturity, reshaping the narrative around their wedding.","Josh allen and hailee steinfeld's wedding quickly collided with controversy.

Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce is officially off the market. On August 27, 2025, Travis Kelce popped the question to Taylor Swift with a dazzling engagement ring estimated to be worth nearly $1 million, marking one of the biggest celebrity proposal stories of the year. But while the NFL star and global pop icon are now preparing for their future together, Travis Kelce’s road to love wasn’t always this glamorous. Before Taylor Swift, he was already quite popular among the ladies, from reality TV drama to long-term romances. Let’s rewind through his dating timeline before he found “the one.”Travis Kelce’s love life first hit the spotlight in 2016 when he starred in the E! reality dating show. Out of 50 contestants, he chose Maya Benberry as the winner. Their romance, however, didn’t last long just a few months after the cameras stopped rolling, the couple went their separate ways.The split wasn’t exactly quiet either. Maya Benberry later hinted in interviews that Travis Kelce might not have been faithful, sparking headlines and early chatter about his bachelor lifestyle. Still, the show gave Travis Kelce national recognition beyond the NFL and set the stage for his future fame.In 2017, Travis Kelce began dating sports broadcaster and influencer Kayla Nicole. This turned out to be his most serious relationship before Taylor Swift, lasting nearly five years. The couple made countless red carpet appearances, social media posts, and even breakups and reconciliations that kept fans guessing.Rumors swirled that money disputes and cheating accusations played a role in their rocky timeline, though both Travis Kelce and Kayla Nicole kept the details vague. By 2022, the relationship had ended for good, leaving fans speculating about why things didn’t work out.Entertainment reporter Zuri Hall was linked to Travis Kelce after sightings in his VIP suite and some public proximity. The connection was never formally confirmed by either side.The pairing quietly fizzled, Travis Kelce later described himself as single around that period. There were no public allegations or drama, just an unverified, short-lived link that didn’t turn into a relationship.Travis Kelce’s love life took a fairytale turn in 2023 when he publicly admitted he tried to give Taylor Swift his number on a friendship bracelet during one of herconcerts. That bold move eventually led to Taylor Swift attending a Kansas City Chiefs game, instantly sending the internet into meltdown.From there, the two quickly became the most-watched couple in the world. Their every outing from NFL suites with Swift’s celebrity squad to Kelce flying overseas for Taylor’s concerts became viral moments. Despite massive media attention, the couple stayed strong through playoff chaos, the Super Bowl spotlight, and nonstop public speculation.And now, in 2025, Travis Kelce has taken the ultimate step by proposing with a nearly million-dollar diamond ring, officially locking in his future with the global superstar.Looking back, Travis Kelce’s dating history feels like a journey that led him right here. From a reality show experiment to a long-term love, and now to a fairytale engagement with Taylor Swift, his story has played out in the public eye every step of the way.But today, all the drama and speculation finally took a back seat.

Why Carly Pearce thinks Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce are “already married”

A relationship built on compatibility and shared values

Carly Pearce didn’t hold back when chatting with “Extra” about why she’s so excited for Taylor Swift’s next chapter — and why, in her mind, Taylor and Travis Kelce may already be a married couple in spirit. Speaking during her fifth year co-hosting the 18th ACM Honors alongside Russell Dickerson in Nashville, Pearce mixed pop-culture curiosity with genuine industry gratitude.Carly’s fandom is obvious: “I love Taylor Swift. Are you kidding? I feel like everyone loves Taylor Swift. She's amazing… I can't wait to hear these songs.” That enthusiasm bled into relationship talk when she added, “I think they're already married. That's my theory… I think they might be… They should be. They seem very happy.” Pearce’s comments tap into a wider cultural fascination with Swift’s life — and with how public relationships influence an artist’s music and business trajectory.Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce may not be engaged just yet, but those close to the couple believe they are heading in that direction.

Elon Musk is suing Apple and OpenAI, claiming that they have an anti-competitive arrangement that gives OpenAI's ChatGPT an unfair advantage on the iPhone. The lawsuit, filed in federal court in Fort Worth, Texas, on behalf of Musk's companies X and xAI, seeks billions of dollars in damages. The suit argues that Apple's integration of OpenAI into its iOS operating system hinders competition and innovation in the AI industry and limits consumer choice.The lawsuit asserts that Apple's partnership with OpenAI makes it nearly impossible for other chatbot makers, including Musk's own Grok, to reach the top of the App Store charts. The legal action sets the stage for a major courtroom battle between Musk, one of the world's richest individuals, and Apple, one of the world's most valuable companies.The lawsuit follows Elon Musk's recent social media posts in which he questioned whether Apple was ""playing politics"" by not promoting his products. Apple responded that its App Store is ""fair and free of bias,"" while OpenAI CEO Sam Altman suggested Musk's complaints were a result of his own management style at X.Apple's collaboration with OpenAI involves integrating the most-downloaded free iPhone app in the U.S., ChatGPT, into its latest iPhones. The lawsuit claims this ""exclusive arrangement"" has made ChatGPT ""the only generative AI chatbot integrated into the iPhone,"" and that the companies have ""locked up markets to maintain their monopolies and prevent innovators like X and xAI from competing.""An OpenAI spokesperson called the lawsuit ""consistent with Mr. Musk’s ongoing pattern of harassment."" Apple has not yet commented on the lawsuit.This is not the first time Apple has faced legal challenges over its App Store. The company has a history of tangling with regulators and companies like Epic Games over claims its app store illegally squelches competition. The allegations in Elon Musk's lawsuit also mirror those brought by the U.S. Justice Department, which sued Apple in March 2023 for allegedly monopolizing the smartphone market. The government's suit claimed Apple used its power to block ""super apps"" that would make it easier for consumers to switch phones, an argument similar to Musk's claim that Apple's conduct inhibits the growth of ""everything apps"" like X.In addition to monetary damages, Elon Musk's lawsuit seeks a court order to end the alleged ""illegal arrangement.""However, the nature of Apple's deal with OpenAI is a point of contention. In court testimony from an unrelated case, Apple's senior vice president of services, Eddy Cue, said the partnership is non-exclusive and Apple is free to integrate other AI apps.","Elon musk is suing apple and openai, claiming that they have an anti-competitive arrangement.

Apple founder Steve Jobs lived by the rule that God is in details



In a proof of power of a single image and the story behind the iconic portrait of Apple co-founder Setev Jobs highlights that how a competent photographer won over the famously camera-shy Jobs. In the year 2006, a Scottish photographer Albert Watson was given the task of capturing a portrait of Apple co-founder Steve Jobs for a magazine. Jobs was known for his camera-shy personality and he also disliked photo sessions. However, the portrait captured by Watson later became iconic and Jobs himself described it as ‘maybe the best picture ever taken of me.’ As reported by Bezinga, commissioned for a magazine feature, was scheduled for 9 a.m. sharp. Jobs arrived at 8:59 a.m., punctual and businesslike. Watson was warned in advance that ‘Jobs hated photographers’. When Watson met Jobs he said, ‘I believe I have you for an hour, but I think I can get this done in half an hour.” Jobs, visibly relieved, replied, “Oh, my god, that would be great. I’ve got so much to do today.”In order to capture the perfect photograph, Watson approached the shoot with minimalist precision. He used a white background, clean lighting and selected passport-style composition. Watson also instructed Jobs to lean a bit forward, imagining himself to be sitting across a table with someone who disagrees with him, but knowing that he was right. Jobs responded with characteristic wit: “Easy for me, I do that every day.”The photo session lasted for about 20 minutes and after seeing the Polaroid, Jobs reportedly said “That’s maybe the best picture ever taken of me.”Years after capturing the perfect portrait of Steve Jobs, Watson received a call from California requesting the photo again. On the same evening he got to know that Jobs has passed away on October 5, 2011 after this battle with pancreatic cancer. Apple then used the same portrait to pay tribute on its homepage. Since then the portrait has become a visual symbol of Jobs’ legacy.Apple founder Steve Jobs believed and lived by a simple rule which clearly defines his successful career, “God is in the details."" As per biographer Walter Isaacon, Jobs spent ‘hours after hours’ obsessing over the smallest of design elements, driven by a belief that ‘God is in the details’. It is believed that this philosophy of Jobs has shaped Apple’s DNA and it still continues to be the culture at the company.",A scottish photographer albert watson was given the task of capturing a portrait of apple co-founder steve jobs for a magazine.

Thewill allow you to dominate the league with meta-relevant mons The Ultra League in Pokemon GO’s Delightful Days season has become one of the most competitive PvP formats, with a constantly shifting meta shaped by buffs, nerfs, and evolving player strategies. To climb the ranks under the 2500 CP cap, trainers need a team that balances bulk, coverage, and shield pressure.One of the best Pokemon GO Ultra League Team compositions dominating the current season features Bellibolt, Cradily, and Shadow Feraligatr.This season’s Ultra League meta rewards teams that can handle Flying and Water-heavy lineups while still checking Steel and Fairy cores. Pokemon with high energy generation and versatile coverage are performing exceptionally well, and bulky pivots remain essential for soaking up damage.Bellibolt’s fast energy gain, Cradily’s bulk, and Shadow Feraligatr’s closing power combine to counter a wide array of common threats, making them one of the most reliable trios for consistent success.This lineup ensures type synergy, coverage balance, and adaptability to the most frequent meta threats.These movesets maximize energy efficiency, shield pressure, and closing potential, giving the team an edge in most matchups.• Bellibolt as a Lead: Starts battles with fast energy, forces shields, and checks Flying and Water Pokemon effectively.• Cradily as a Safe Switch: With dual Rock/Grass typing and bulk, Cradily neutralizes many core meta Pokemon while absorbing charged moves.• Shadow Feraligatr as a Closer: With Hydro Cannon and Crunch, Feraligatr can sweep weakened teams, making it a lethal endgame threat.Together, these three create a cycle of shield pressure, energy control, and flexible coverage that punishes opponents’ mistakes.For Ultra League battles, Pokemon need carefully optimized IVs to maximize bulk while staying under the 2500 CP cap.• Bellibolt: Prioritize Defense and Stamina (e.g., 15/10/15) for survivability.• Cradily: Look for high bulk spreads to extend its safe switch utility.• Shadow Feraligatr: Benefits from higher Attack IVs, ensuring charged moves secure key knockouts.Balancing bulk and attack is critical for this team’s performance.According to PvPoke simulations and player data, this team consistently maintains strong win rates across the ladder, provided shields are managed carefully.• Bellibolt: Dominates Skarmory, Galarian Stunfisk, and Pelipper.• Cradily: Pressures bulky Waters and checks Fairies like Togekiss.• Shadow Feraligatr: Handles Azumarill, Poliwrath, and Steel-heavy cores.• Bellibolt: Ground-types like Garchomp and Grass-types such as Venusaur.• Cradily: Steel-types like Scizor and Bastiodon.• Shadow Feraligatr: Electric-types (Electivire) and Grass-types (Trevenant).Trainers should pivot intelligently and preserve shields for matchups where the weaknesses could be exploited.• Lead with Bellibolt: Apply early pressure and generate energy to force shield decisions.• Pivot to Cradily: Absorb damage and use its Rock/Grass coverage to counter switch-ins.• Save Shadow Feraligatr for the Endgame: Its raw damage output thrives against opponents with limited shields.• Shield Management: Protect Bellibolt to maintain early momentum or reserve shields for Feraligatr’s finishing potential.Move counting and baiting with charged moves can be the deciding factors in close matches.The Bellibolt, Cradily, and Shadow Feraligatr team stands out in the Delightful Days 2025 Ultra League meta for its balance of offense, defense, and coverage. By mastering shield management, smart pivoting, and charged move timing, trainers can use this trio to reliably climb the GBL ladder.Also read: Best Pokemon GO Great League Team (Delightful Days): Ideal Team Composition, Best Movesets, Wins, Losses, Performance Statistics, and More While other options like Shadow Gliscor, Pangoro, and Cobalion remain strong, this team provides one of the most consistent paths to victory this season.","Best ultra league team: bellibolt, cradily, and shadow feraligatr.
