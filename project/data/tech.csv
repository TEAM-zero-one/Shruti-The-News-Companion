NEW DELHI: An NRI’s praise for India after returning home following an eight-year gap has become viral.Investor Alok Jain wrote on X that a friend from New York had recently visited him. According to Jain, the visitor was struck by the energy in the country and how fast India appeared to be growing.“An outsider’s perspective can be so different from our own,” Jain wrote, comparing it to how people living here may see the country.In his post, Jain said his friend was particularly surprised by how affordable many things in India were. He mentioned medical care, transport, internet and mobile services.The visitor compared these with costs in the US. According to Jain, his friend ""pays $600 for mobile and data at his house Pays $30k for health insurance for 4!! Per annum Pays 2 percent as property taxes per year..!!""Jain added that while air quality was better in the US, many good things were happening in India.The post drew a range of responses from social media users. One person wrote that many of their friends living in Bengaluru preferred it to New York City.Another user commented that from an outsider’s point of view, India’s main problems came down to a lack of civic sense. ""I am an outsider and I can say that everything wrong with the country has to do only with lack of civic sense among the people,"" he wrote.Someone who said they had lived in the Bay Area and were currently based in New York, agreed that phone bills and insurance costs in the US was high, but said salaries were also much higher, making direct comparisons difficult.The user added that property taxes varied by state and often fund services like public schools and clean roads. They said India stood out in areas such as access to medical care for those who can afford it, digital public services, and the availability of affordable physical labour.","Investor alok jain wrote on x that a friend from new york had recently visited him.

Bluebird Lift-Off Shows ISRO Commercial Power As Nambi Narayanan Calls LVM-3 Game Changer Move

The Indian Space Research Organisation ( Isro ) on Wednesday released rare onboard camera footage from its heaviest rocket, LVM3-M6, offering a rocket-eye view of the BlueBird Block-2 mission from liftoff to satellite separation.The footage shared by Isro on X features visuals captured by cameras onboard and documents each major phase of the ascent. The footage shows the rocket lifting off from the second launch pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota, Andhra Pradesh, followed by the separation of the twin S200 solid strap-on boosters. It then captures the separation of the L110 liquid core stage and the jettisoning of the payload fairing, before concluding with the successful separation of the BlueBird Block-2 satellite into Low Earth Orbit.The stunning visuals were recorded during Isro’s successful commercial launch of the next-generation US communication satellite for AST SpaceMobile earlier in the day. The 6,100 kg satellite was placed into its intended orbit at an altitude of about 520 km, approximately 15 minutes after launch.The 43.5-metre-tall LVM3 lifted off at 8.55 am after the completion of a 24-hour countdown. Powered by two S200 solid boosters, a liquid core stage and a cryogenic upper stage, the rocket performed all mission events as planned.The space agency said the mission, designated LVM3-M6, marked the sixth operational flight of the LVM3 launch vehicle, nicknamed ‘Bahubali’ for its heavy-lift capability. Isro chief, Dr V Narayanan, described mission’s success as a ""season’s gift"" to the country.BlueBird Block-2 is part of a Low Earth Orbit constellation being developed by US-based AST SpaceMobile. The satellite is designed to enable direct-to-mobile connectivity, providing 4G and 5G voice and video calls, text messaging, streaming and data services directly to standard mobile smartphones.Developed by Isro, the three-stage LVM3 has a lift-off mass of 640 tonnes and a payload capability of 4,200 kg to Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit. In earlier missions, it has successfully launched Chandrayaan-2, Chandrayaan-3 and two OneWeb missions carrying 72 satellites.","Isro has released rare onboard camera footage from its heaviest rocket, lvm3-m6.

Sami Zayn WWE salary and contract earnings

Endorsements, merchandise sales, and total household income

Sami Zayn’s wife on the most important match of his life: Elimination Chamber 2023 Diary

Originally named Rami Sebei, Sami Zayn has made a name for himself as one of the most respected and consistently pushed stars in the WWE Universe. Zayn has been a model of longevity, character work, and stable placement on premium live events, and his stability in that regard has equated to financial security. Industry-wide estimates have his individual net worth in the low millions as of the year 2025, primarily from his WWE contract and associated revenue streams like brand endorsements and deals.Khadija Sebei, wife of Zayn, lives under a very low profile, not being in any public business or entertainment business. It means any public appraisal of the couple's fortunes turns primarily on Zayn's professional earnings (no apparent records of independent commercial income linked to her name per se). Thus, their joint fortune is a poor reflection of the value the wrestler makes over a career, not of two parallel portfolios of income.Sami Zayn likely earned a WWE contract commensurate with his status as an invaluable veteran today who is not necessarily a marquee star. His annual WWE salary is estimated by various industry trackers in the range of $350,000 to $500,000. This number generally consists of a base salary that is guaranteed, bonuses that are based on performance, and pay that is based on premium live events and overseas tours.While it is rumored that emerging talent is on developmental deals, Zayn would be able to negotiate contracts that he has been earning with a consistent presence on television for years. When he is utilized in the many squad storylines and championship programs in a given year, or at the main event level for Pay-Per-Views, his earnings go up. Another benefit is that Zayn has built long-term sustainability as opposed to short-term surges.Sami Zayn also makes money off of merchandise royalties, which still plays an important role for veteran talent, on top of his WWE contract. Recurring revenue all year long comes from T-shirts, collectibles, and special event merchandise associated with major storylines. He has also ventured into limited media and entertainment work, including TV and streaming appearances, as additional sources of income.When all of the combined sources and standout earnings room are combined, responsible estimates place Sami Zayn's net worth at roughly $2 million in 2025. Aside from reportedly landing a three-year modelling contract with the major American brand this year, all fatigue to Khadija Sebei has proven to be a speculative wage, so combined, they can both expect a net worth in the ballpark of $2 million to $2.5 million at the most, to allow space for private investments and debts of others.Also Read: IShowSpeed’s latest YouTube drop features WWE legend Randy Orton","Sami zayn likely earned a wwe contract commensurate with his status as an invaluable veteran today.

George Russell’s Mercedes F1 career, salary, and brand endorsements

Carmen Montero Mundt’s professional career and the net worth of the duo

George Russell will have made a significant imprint on the earnings of Formula One by the year 2025. Russell’s revenue path is very much like that of other top drivers, applying to their advantage the sporting success they have through the commercial opportunities that are open. His ability to combine competitive results with being marketable makes it so that he is able to quite steadily grow his wealth, especially as Mercedes has already placed him in the long-term design of their team. Carmen Montero Mundt, who is the partner of George, enables the couple to accumulate wealth together through her career in finance and investment management.George Russell’s new Mercedes contract, covering several years, is roughly £30 million per annum, which puts him in the highest echelon with respect to driver salaries. Besides his basic salary, Russell’s net worth is estimated to be $16 million, which reflects not only his race winnings but also the inflating sponsorships that he has developed.Amongst the brand names attached to Russell are Puma, Bell Helmets, and Mercedes-Benz lifestyle campaigns, where he is the face, which together contribute to Russell being more visible than ever. His image, which is a polished one, together with the steady performances like podiums in Australia and a win in the 2025 Canadian Grand Prix, makes him a priceless brand ambassador.Carmen Montero Mundt has carved out a professional career of her own apart from her husband’s identity. She has worked in the UK, and her London financial firm's reputation is that of a private banker who specializes in wealthy clients' relations. While her net worth is low compared to Russell’s, it is estimated that it is somewhere in the range of $185,000 as the professional earnings in the present year. Apart from this, she also earns from investments and lifestyle collaborations.The total net worth of the couple is estimated to be around $16-$17 million in the present year. Apart from their professional careers, brands and investments have added to their growth scale.Also Read: George Russell’s romantic Alps retreat with Carmen Montero Mundt fuels engagement buzz as fans predict a proposal","George russell’s new mercedes contract, covering several years, is roughly £30 million per annum.

Matt Kalish’s rise from DraftKings success and Adin Ross’ latest claim

Police Hunt Antonio Brown After SHOCKING Shooting At Adin Ross Event; Warrant Out Against NFL Star





The FaZe Clan fallout has once again put the spotlight on Matt Kalish, most widely known as the co-founder of DraftKings. He is also the CEO of HardScope and a major stakeholder in FaZe Media. Kalish invested $11 million into FaZe Media at its formation, instantly becoming its largest stakeholder with a 49% ownership stakeThat kind of influence and control of the company was recently called out by popular streamer Adin Ross, who publicly questioned leadership decisions tied to FaZe Clan’s recent departures. Despite Kalish’s contributions, Ross is seeking clarification regarding certain business strategies and creative decisions within the company.Matt Kalish built his reputation long before FaZe Clan came into the limelight. As one of the original co-founders of DraftKings, he helped shape the fantasy sports industry into a billion-dollar market. He also launched HardScope with the aim of giving influencers more ownership and structure. With that vision, he started up FaZe Clan in 2024 when GameSquare acquired the brand and positioned it as a creator-first media company.His $11 million investment earned him a seat on the board, placing him at the center of important strategic decisions. He was a stabilizing force of the company, especially after years of financial turbulence surrounding the FaZe brand. However, this clean and consumer-friendly image has now shifted after Adin Ross accused company leadership of mishandling creator agreements.In a recent livestream, Ross directly called out Kalish and former FaZe Media CEO Richard “Banks” Bengtson for introducing revenue expectations too late in the process. He minced no words as he said, “Banks and Matt Kalish, you guys messed up, because initially, with the announcement video, you guys were supposed to make them sign… You guys waited two years later. That's the issue…”According to Ross, the reported request for 20% of creator revenue came only after streamers had already built large audiences. This led to former FaZe Clan members, including Lacy, Adapt, and Jasontheween, exiting the company. The issue further deepened when Banks, who left the company in July 2025, called those signings one of the worst decisions of his life. As of now, Matt Kalish has not publicly responded to these significant claims made by Ross.Also read: Adin Ross confirms person allegedly hit by Clavicular’s Tesla Cybertruck is alive",Matt kalish is the co-founder of draftkings and ceo of hardscope.

Alexa Bliss’ WWE success and evolving career earnings

Ryan Cabrera’s music career, royalties, and lifestyle choices

Alexa Bliss and Ryan Cabrera’s combined net worth in 2025 is estimated at around $6 million, reflecting two very different entertainment careers that intersect through marriage. It's one from the worldwide circus tent of pro wrestling, where a star's name value and staying power have always counted every bit as much, if not more than, wins and titles. One stems from the early-2000s pop-rock explosion when radio singles and CD sales could shape a career for decades. Combined, they give us a glimpse of what modern celebrity means in terms of money: less of one dominant moment and more of all the outlets contributing to success, the many streams and tributaries flowing into one range.Neither of them is one of the top 10 richest names in their industries, but their combined earnings reflect steadiness, brand, and the long-term dividend of remaining relevant. Their 2025 net worth includes WWE contracts, music royalties, occasional appearances, and a lifestyle that is comfortable but not flashy.Alexa Bliss has been one of the biggest women's stars for WWE over the last 10 years. A former several-time Raw and SmackDown Women’s Champion, her earnings have been primarily based on WWE base contracts, pay-per-view bonuses, merchandise royalties, and premium live event appearances.Her return to the active roster in 2025 elevated her earning capacity, since special presentation talent generally receives a much greater appearance fee and merch showcasing.Outside of the ring, Bliss makes plenty of money off sponsorships, media appearances, and a huge social media presence that opens up partnerships with brands. These extra income sources keep her finances stable, especially during times when she isn't in the ring full-time. Her personal fortune is estimated at between $3 million and $4 million, so she is the financial heavyweight of the couple.The early 2000s hitmaker had chart-topping singles and a certified-platinum debut album. Despite the loss of his mainstream radio presence, however, his catalogue lives on, earning money through streaming, licensing, and royalties. These long-term revenues often underpin the earnings of artists from that era.Cabrera also works as a catalyst; his income comes from occasional live performances, television appearances, and music-related projects. His estimated net worth in 2025 stands at roughly $2 million. Together with Alexa Bliss, their combined net worth of about $6 million reflects diversified income rather than explosive growth.Also Read: John Cena retired: List of all celebrities and WWE superstars who paid tribute to the GOAT","Alexa bliss and ryan cabrera’s combined net worth in 2025 is estimated at around $6 million.

Quinton Rampage Jackson gifts son Elijah Jackson a rare Audi R8 after keeping childhood promise

Quinton Rampage Jackson made Christmas very special this year. The former UFC light heavyweight champion surprised his youngest son with a gift many people only dream about. Just days before Christmas, Jackson shared that he spent about $275,000 on a car for his son, Elijah “Rampage” Jackson. This was not a last-minute idea. Jackson said it was a promise he made when his son was very young. Years later, he finally kept that promise.The moment quickly went viral after Jackson posted it on X. Fans saw a proud father and a shocked son sharing a quiet but powerful moment together. The gift stood out not just because of the price, but because of the meaning behind it. Jackson did not buy something for himself. He chose to reward his son and celebrate family during the holidays. That message made the story travel fast across social media.Jackson revealed the surprise on X, where he posted a video from his garage. In the clip, Elijah Jackson walks in and sees a black Audi R8 waiting for him. He pauses, clearly stunned, and asks if the car is really his.Jackson replies with a calm smile and says, “Like I promised you when you were a kid.” He then reminds his son to drive carefully, warning him that the car is very fast.After that, he hands over the keys.The Audi R8 is one of the brand’s top sports cars. It comes with a V10 engine and a carbon-fiber body. According to Edmunds, newer Audi R8 models can cost up to $275,000, depending on features. Older versions can be cheaper, but Jackson did not share the exact model.Audi officially ended R8 production in March 2024, as confirmed by Audi. That has made existing models more valuable among car lovers.Jackson shares Elijah with his former wife, Yuki Imoto. He is also a father to other children, including daughter Naname Nakia Jackson. Still, this moment was fully about a father and son.Later, Jackson also spoke about his income today. During a livestream, he said streaming has paid him more than fighting ever did. “I have been streaming for eight months, and I made more than I did in my fighting career,” he said. He added that sponsors support him more now because more people watch his streams.Quinton Rampage Jackson streams travel videos, home life clips, and content with other creators. He also shared that having two kids in college pushed him to focus on streaming full-time. The success of that move made this Christmas promise possible.Also Read: Ex-UFC Champion Sean O’Malley Flags Trouble For Dana White As The White House Card Faces Major Concern","Quinton rampage jackson surprises son with $275,000 christmas gift as emotional family moment goes viral.

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021. He broke many records in the last five years with his wealth and became the first person to break $500 billion in October 2025. At present, he leads the richest people in the world by a very large margin of $425 billion over Google co-founder Larry Page and is soon to reach $700 billion.","Elon musk has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion.

Mizkif net worth 2025 and how his streaming career shaped his earnings

Image Via Instagram





Mizkif has always remained one of the most popular names in online streaming circles with his unpredictable content, amazing ability to connect with his audience, and high-profile career changes. Moving on towards the end of the year 2025, his finances continue to be in the headlines with his high-profile career changes. Whether it’s a shift in platforms or a departure from organizational roles, Mizkif has become a name not associated with a linear career path, hence his net worth being a constant point of discussion.While exact figures are difficult to verify, there are several Internet estimates that say Mizkif is still in solid financial standing despite all of the highs and lows. Where once his income could be traced back to one specific area or industry, his career has become so diverse that his net worth is more of akind of deal, encompassing years of successful streaming, recognition as a brand, and an assortment of skill sets for adapting to an ever-shifting market landscape that is particularly challenging for creators like Mizkif to navigate successfully.As of 2025, Mizkif is reportedly estimated to have a net worth ranging from 4 million dollars to 6.5 million dollars, although some conservative estimates put it slightly lower than that. Although there is a considerable gap in these estimates due to discrepancies regarding calculations of platforming or spending, most people agree on where he got most of his money, which was presumably back when he was streaming.Streaming has continued to be a steady stream of income for him. He has, through the years, drawn income through subscription, ad revenue, and donations. Despite quitting Twitch to join Kick, it will be fair to say that many of his fans followed him, which is an important factor in ensuring a steady income. Deals probably followed, which enhanced income, even if figures are not made public.In addition to live streaming, Mizkif earns additional income from sponsorships, merchandise sales, and his channel on YouTube. In most cases, these additional sources of income tend to create financial stability for most of these influencers. Even though he does not have leadership positions within large corporations anymore, he owes that experience to his financial structure.All things considered, Mizkif's net worth in 2025 is indicative of his professional growth and success. In terms of his participation in the streaming industry, he has been changing. Nonetheless, his ability to sustain his fan base and various sources of income has guaranteed his ongoing financial success. Despite varying net estimates, Mizkif is undoubtedly one of the wealthiest people who came from the streaming industry.Also Read: Adin Ross confirms person allegedly hit by Clavicular’s Tesla Cybertruck is alive",Mizkif is reportedly estimated to have a net worth ranging from 4 million dollars to 6.5 million dollars.

Adin Ross explains FaZe Clan exits as GameSquare stake dispute while Richard Bengtsone denies involvement







FaZe Clan is in the middle of another big shake-up. The famous esports and creator group has seen many well-known members leave at the same time. Fans are confused and want answers fast. The biggest question is simple: who owns FaZe Clan now, and why are creators quitting together? Right now, GameSquare is the only owner of FaZe Clan. This comes after a long year of changes, buybacks, and exits at the top. As the exits happened, streamer Adin Ross shared his side of the story during a livestream.He claimed the issue was about money and ownership, not drama. At the same time, former FaZe leader Richard Bengtsone, also known as FaZe Banks, stepped in to clear his name. He said he had nothing to do with the recent exits. Here is what happened, step by step.FaZe Clan was started over 15 years ago by Richard Bengtsone. He led the group for years and became the face of the brand. That changed in 2023, when GameSquare bought FaZe Clan in an all-stock deal.In June 2024, Bengtsone returned by buying back 25% of FaZe Clan from GameSquare. Many fans thought this meant stability was back. But the return did not last long.In March 2025, Bengtsone’s company, Faze Media, sold its stake in FaZe Esports. This move gave GameSquare full control again.A few months later, in July 2025, Bengtsone stepped down as CEO. From that point on, GameSquare became the sole owner of FaZe Clan.Soon after, creators began leaving. On Christmas, QTCinderella, JasonTheWeen, StableRonaldo, Lacy, Adapt, and Silky all posted the same message on X:“Left @FaZeClan”As questions grew, Adin Ross spoke during a livestream. He claimed the exits were linked to a late demand for ownership shares. Ross said:“They never signed that 20% initially. They [GameSquare] come after them a year and a half later and then ask for the 20%…. That’s in the wrong. ‘Cause if your intention was to sign these guys for 20% of FaZe, they probably would’ve all done it.”He added:“But now, you wait until they’re big, have millions of followers, so why would they sign the contract? You can’t put a deal in their fking faces at this point.”Many fans then wondered if FaZe Banks was involved. Bengtsone responded on X and shut that down. He wrote that he had “nothing to do” with the situation, said he had moved on, and added that he would help if asked.Also Read: Viral Video Shows Clavicular And N3on Attacked With Red Liquid As Past Crash Livestream Resurfaces Amid Ongoing Kick Ban","Faze clan is in the middle of another big shake-up.

Arattai app gets end-to-end encryption







Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu was recently asked by an X (formerly Twitter) user why there is no talk about Arattai now? The user quoted a post stating that Telegram is worth $30 billion with only 30 employees working from home, no office. Responding to the user’s question, Vembu shared that the company is doing “updates weekly” and is working on “some very important features”. “We will market it more once we feel we are satisfied with the feature set!,” Vembu posted, adding “This is a marathon. We are geared for it.”To recall, the Arattai app debuted in 2021 as a rival to Meta’s WhatsApp. Years after its launch, the app recently gained momentum after senior government ministers like Piyush Goyal joined the platform.

It is now being tested by about 6,000 people in the company. We identified some issues and have fixed them. We are doing one more round of testing on a new build that has fixed the issues identified,” he then said.","Zoho founder sridhar vembu was recently asked by an x (formerly twitter) user why there is no talk about arattai now.

Gaming community mourns visionary Developer who shaped modern shooters





Vince Zampella, the gaming industry titan behind the blockbuster Call of Duty franchise and leader of the Battlefield series, died Sunday in a single-vehicle crash on Angeles Crest Highway near Los Angeles. He was 55. The Ferrari he was driving veered off the winding mountain road around 12:45 p.m., struck a concrete barrier, and caught fire, according to California Highway Patrol reports. A passenger in the vehicle was ejected and later died at a hospital. Authorities have not confirmed whether alcohol or drugs were factors in the crash.Zampella's career defined modern military shooters. He co-founded Infinity Ward in 2002, where he spearheaded the original Call of Duty in 2003—a World War II game that evolved into one of gaming's most successful franchises. The series has sold over 500 million copies globally and generated more than $30 billion in revenue.After his contentious 2010 departure from Activision and subsequent legal settlement, Zampella established Respawn Entertainment. The studio delivered critically acclaimed titles including Titanfall, Apex Legends, and the Star Wars Jedi series.
