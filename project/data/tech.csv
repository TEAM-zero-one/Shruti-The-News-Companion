While the recovery of Cavinder’s SUV is a positive step, Beck remains without two of his prized vehicles.As Miami’s star quarterback, Beck has a lot on his plate, balancing his football career while dealing with this alarming situation.

Andhra Pradesh-origin scientist’s team opens door on black holes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/vijayawada/andhra-pradesh-origin-scientists-team-opens-door-on-black-holes/articleshow/118434954.cms,"Project to survey 40 mn galaxies, quasars

VIJAYAWADA: A team of scientists in the United States, led by Indian origin astrophysicist Raga Deepika Pucha , have uncovered the largest samples ever of intermediate-mass black holes and dwarf galaxies hosting an active black hole.The samples, said to be more than three times the existing census of black holes and dwarf galaxies, will allow for more in-depth studies on the dynamics between dwarf galaxy evolution and black hole growth.It can also open up vast discovery potential surrounding the evolution of the universe's earliest black holes.Raga Deepika's parents reside in Tenali town of Guntur district in Andhra Pradesh Using early data from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), Deepika's team compiled the largest sample ever of dwarf galaxies that host an actively feeding black hole, as well as the most extensive collection of intermediate-mass black hole candidates to date.The dual achievement not only expands scientists' understanding of the black hole population in the universe but also sets the stage for further explorations regarding the formation of the first black holes to form in the universe and their role in galaxy evolution.According to a communication released by NoirLab, DESI is a state-of-the-art instrument that can capture light from 5,000 galaxies simultaneously. It was constructed, and is operated, with funding from the US dept of energy (DOE), office of science. DESI is mounted on the US National Science Foundation (NSF) Nicholas U Mayall at the NSF Kitt Peak national observatory.The program is now in its fourth of five years surveying the sky and is set to observe roughly 40 million galaxies and quasars by the time the project ends.DESI project is an international collaboration of more than 900 researchers from over 70 institutions around the world and is managed by DOE's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.With DESI's early data, which include survey validation and 20% of the first year of operations, the team, led by University of Utah postdoctoral researcher Deepika, was able to obtain an unprecedented dataset that includes the spectra of 410,000 galaxies, including roughly 115,000 dwarf galaxies - small, diffuse galaxies containing thousands to several billions of stars and very little gas. This extensive set would allow Deepika and her team to explore the complex interplay between black hole evolution and dwarf galaxy evolution.While astrophysicists are fairly confident that all massive galaxies, like our milky way, host black holes at their centers, the picture becomes unclear when moving toward the low-mass end of the spectrum. Finding black holes is a challenge in itself, but identifying them in dwarf galaxies is even more difficult, owing to their small sizes and the limited ability of current instruments to resolve the regions close to these objects, says Pucha. An actively feeding black hole, however, is easier to spot.""When a black hole at the center of a galaxy starts feeding, it unleashes a tremendous amount of energy into its surroundings, transforming into what we call an active galactic nucleus. This dramatic activity serves as a beacon, allowing us to identify hidden black holes in these small galaxies,"" Deepika explained.The team identified 2,500 candidate dwarf galaxies hosting an active galactic nucleus (AGN) - the largest sample ever discovered. The significantly higher fraction of dwarf galaxies hosting an AGN (2%) relative to previous studies (about 0.5%) is an exciting result and suggests scientists have been missing a substantial number of low-mass, undiscovered black holes.","Project to survey 40 mn galaxies, quasars by the time the project ends.

Reducing errors is the big challenge



Anyone who has sat through a third-grade science class knows there are three primary states of matter: solid, liquid and gas.Microsoft now says it has created a new state of matter in its quest to make a powerful machine, called a quantum computer, that could accelerate the development of everything from batteries to medicines to artificial intelligence.On Wednesday, Microsoft's scientists said they had built what is known as a ""topological qubit"" based on this new phase of physical existence, which could be harnessed to solve mathematical, scientific and technological problems.With the development, Microsoft is raising the stakes in what is set to be the next big technological contest, beyond today's race over artificial intelligence. Scientists have chased the dream of a quantum computer -- a machine that could exploit the strange and exceedingly powerful behavior of subatomic particles or very cold objects -- since the 1980s.The push heated up in December when Google unveiled an experimental quantum computer that needed just five minutes to complete a calculation that most supercomputers could not finish in 10 septillion years -- longer than the age of the known universe.Microsoft's quantum technology could leapfrog the methods under development at Google. As part of its research, the company built multiple topological qubits inside a new kind of computer chip that combines the strengths of the semiconductors that power classical computers with the superconductors that are typically used to build a quantum computer.When such a chip is cooled to extremely low temperatures, it behaves in unusual and powerful ways that Microsoft believes will allow it to solve technological, mathematical and scientific problems that classical machines never could. The technology is not as volatile as other quantum technologies, the company said, making it easier to exploit its power.Some question whether Microsoft has achieved this milestone, and many leading academics said quantum computers would not be fully realized for decades. But Microsoft's scientists said their methods would help them reach the finish line sooner.""We view this as something that is years away, not decades away,"" said Chetan Nayak , a Microsoft technical fellow who led the team that built the technology.Microsoft's technology, which was detailed in a research paper published in the science journal Nature on Wednesday, adds new impetus to a race that could reshape the technological landscape. In addition to accelerating progress across many technological and scientific fields, a quantum computer could be powerful enough to break the encryption that protects national secrets.Any advances are set to have geopolitical implications. Even as the United States explores quantum computing primarily through corporations like Microsoft and a wave of startups, the Chinese government has said it is investing $15.2 billion in the technology. The European Union has committed $7.2 billion.Quantum computing, which builds on decades of research into a type of physics called quantum mechanics, is still an experimental technology. But after recent strides by Microsoft, Google and others, scientists are confident that the technology will eventually live up to its promise.""Quantum computing is a thrilling prospect for physics, and for the world,"" said Frank Wilczek, a theoretical physicist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.To understand quantum computing, it helps to know how a traditional computer works. A smartphone, laptop or desktop PC relies on tiny chips made from semiconductors, which are materials that conduct electricity in some but not all situations. These chips store and process numbers, adding them, multiplying them and so on. They perform these calculations by manipulating ""bits"" of information. Each bit holds either a 1 or a 0.A quantum computer operates differently. A quantum bit, or qubit, relies on the curious behavior of subatomic particles or exotic materials cooled to extremely low temperatures.When it is either extremely small or extremely cold, a single object can behave like two separate objects at the same time. By harnessing that behavior, scientists can build a qubit that holds a combination of 1 and 0. This means that two qubits can hold four values at once. And as the number of qubits grows, a quantum computer becomes exponentially more powerful.Companies use a variety of techniques to build these machines. In the United States, most, including Google, build qubits using superconductors, which are materials that conduct electricity without losing the energy they are transmitting. They create these superconductors by cooling metals to extremely low temperatures.Microsoft has bet on an approach that few others are taking: combining semiconductors with superconductors. The basic principle -- along with the name topological qubit -- was first proposed in 1997 by Alexei Kitaev, a Russian American physicist.The company began working on this unusual project in the early 2000s, when many researchers did not think such technology was possible. It is Microsoft's longest-running research project.""This is something that all three CEOs of this company have bet on,"" Satya Nadella , Microsoft's CEO, said in an interview. (The company's previous CEOs were Bill Gates, a founder, and Steve Ballmer , who ran Microsoft in the early 2000s.)The company has now created a single device that is part indium arsenide (a type of semiconductor) and part aluminum (a superconductor at low temperatures). When it is cooled to about 400 degrees below zero, it exhibits a kind of otherworldly behavior that might make quantum computers possible.Philip Kim, a physics professor at Harvard University, said Microsoft's new creation was significant because topological qubits could accelerate the development of quantum computers. ""If everything works out, Microsoft's research could be revolutionary,"" he said.But Jason Alicea, a professor of theoretical physics at the California Institute of Technology, questioned whether the company had actually built a topological qubit, saying the behavior of quantum systems is often hard to prove.""A topological qubit is possible in principle, and people agree it is a worthwhile goal,"" Alicea said. ""You have to verify, though, that a device behaves in all the magical ways that theory predicts it should; otherwise, the reality may turn out to be less rosy for quantum computing. Fortunately, Microsoft is now set up to try.""","Microsoft says it has created a new state of matter in its quest to make a quantum computer.

EE warns users about rising scam risks on Valentine's Day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/ee-warns-users-about-rising-scam-risks-on-valentines-day/articleshow/118272199.cms,"Representative image

How people are exposing themselves to scams

Signs of a romance scam

Asking for money or gifts (64%)



Using urgent or emotional language (49%)



Avoiding video calls or in-person meetings (41%)



Telling a sob story to gain sympathy (31%)



Giving inconsistent answers (24%)



Evading personal questions (20%)



Making grand promises or boasting excessively (12%)



Asking overly personal questions (11%)



UK mobile network operator EE has issued an urgent warning about the dangers of sharing personal details online, particularly when dating. The mobile network provider found that many users are giving away sensitive information too easily, putting themselves at risk of scams and impersonation fraud.According to EE’s survey of 2,000 UK phone users, an alarming 93% admitted to sharing personal details over text, messaging apps, or social media. A significant number do so while chatting with new acquaintances or online dating. With Valentine's Day heightening social interactions, EE is urging people to remain cautious.""Online dating has opened exciting new options for singles, but also a novel channel for criminals hunting for new ways to defraud their victims,"" EE stated.Research shows that one in ten (11%) people currently dating have been targeted by romance scams . Even more concerning, one in five victims lost an average of £2,500 due to these fraudulent schemes.According to The Mirror, EE’s findings revealed that 65% of users shared their phone number, 51% disclosed their location and 35% provided access to their social media profile.Additionally, 345 respondents said they had noticed suspicious behaviour from someone they were messaging, while 15% had been directly asked for money.The main danger lies in trusting people who may not be who they claim to be. Fraudsters can use personal information to impersonate victims, potentially leading to identity theft and financial loss.Even non-EE customers should stay alert. Last year, during the Valentine’s period, EE recorded a sharp rise in scam texts. In February 2024 alone, the company blocked 12 million malicious messages—well above the usual monthly average of 8.9 million. The network expects similar activity this year.""Scammers are experts at preying on the vulnerable,"" warns Richard Wainer, EE’s regulatory affairs director. ""At this time of year, when social media is full of public displays of affection, it can be tempting to turn a blind eye to the red flags, but spotting them is more important than ever"", Wainer added.To help users stay safe, EE has identified key red flags to watch out for when chatting online:EE urges users to remain cautious when communicating with people they don’t know well, especially when emotions are involved. Scammers often take advantage of trust and vulnerability, making it crucial to recognise the warning signs before it’s too late.","Uk mobile network operator ee has issued an urgent warning about the dangers of sharing personal details online, particularly when dating.

BEIJING: Chinese technology giant Tencent on Monday said it had started trialling its own artificial intelligence reasoning model after integrating DeepSeek into some of its products, saying the move would make responses ""more 'human'"".Insurgent Chinese AI startup DeepSeek made global headlines last month when it unveiled its R1 chatbot that can seemingly match American competitors at a fraction of the cost.Since then, a series of major Chinese companies have said they will integrate DeepSeek's technology into their products.On Monday, Tencent said in a post on WeChat, the social media platform it owns, that selected users of its Yuanbao chatbot may address queries to either DeepSeek or its homegrown AI reasoning model "" Hunyuan Thinker "".""With the support of two deep reasoning models, the question-answering is more professional, the reasoning is more powerful, and the writing is more 'human',"" Tencent said of the beta testing rollout.Tencent, which also operates the QQ messaging app and is a major player in online gaming, has sought to capture a larger share of the burgeoning AI market in China.The Shenzhen-based company is understood to have started exploring the integration of DeepSeek into multiple products, with some users of the domestic version of WeChat noting the addition of an AI search function on Sunday.A Tencent spokesperson confirmed to AFP that the domestic app, which has over a billion monthly active users, had ""recently started beta testing access to DeepSeek"".The move intensifies competition in China's internet search sector after tech titan Baidu said Sunday it would weave DeepSeek into its market-leading search engine to ""enrich a more diversified search experience"".Last week, Chinese electric-vehicle giant BYD said it would integrate DeepSeek's software into its cars, following other domestic automakers like Geely, Great Wall Motors and Leapmotor.Despite its rise to prominence at home, DeepSeek has drawn scrutiny in some countries over its collection and handling of users' personal data.South Korea became the latest jurisdiction to remove the chatbot from app stores on Monday pending a security review, following similar moves in Italy, Taiwan, Australia and some US states.","Chinese technology giant tencent has started trialling its own artificial intelligence reasoning model.

Takeaways: Tesla has sued Chinese customers and journalists and won almost every time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/takeaways-tesla-has-sued-chinese-customers-and-journalists-and-won-almost-every-time/articleshow/118180992.cms,"In this photo, Zhang Yazhou sits on the roof of her damaged Tesla Model 3 with a bullhorn outside a Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou (Image credits: AP)

Tesla did not return requests for comment. Here are some key things to know about Tesla's success in China:

Media coverage of Tesla in China is constrained

BEIJING: Tesla has embraced an aggressive legal strategy in China to stifle its critics suing its own customers.That's left some Tesla owners desperate. Zhang Yazhou protested publicly that her Model 3's brakes had failed and caused an accident in 2021 that sent her parents to the hospital. Tesla said that wasn't true and sued her for defamation. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay the $1.1-trillion company more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize for her criticism.""I refuse to accept it,"" said Zhang, who appealed the verdict. ""As a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.""As concerns mount about eroding checks and balances in the US, Tesla's record in China shows how it has thrived in a system where regulators, the courts and media all answer to the ruling Communist Party.It's not common for automakers in China or elsewhere to sue their own customers. But Tesla has done so successfully in China, where Elon Musk 's company has used the courts and the patronage of a powerful leader to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.Musk has a powerful patron in China Tesla's commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China's premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping . Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China's financial capital under his watch in 2019.With Li's support, Tesla was the first foreign automaker allowed to retain complete control over its China venture. Tesla got low-interest loans, tax breaks, favorable regulatory changes and other benefits.In January 2020, Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. That year, Tesla turned an annual profit for the first time in its history and Musk was soon declared the world's richest person.Musk's ""greater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,"" said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd, an advisory firm based in Shanghai. ""He's done a good job of it in China, and he's done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.""Requests for comment to the state council, which is run by Li Qiang, went unanswered.Tesla has had an impressive winning streak in Chinese courts Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures.The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review of public court documents and Chinese media reports by The Associated Press.Tesla won all eleven cases for which AP could determine the verdicts. Two judgments are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it has also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgments in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.While some industry experts say it's generally difficult for customers to win such cases, others say it's remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.""For Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,"" said Russo, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. ""The odds are stacked against you. It's like going to the casino and winning every hand.""In a statement to AP, the Shanghai high people's court said that judgements are the result of a ""fair trial.""""It cannot be assumed that the party has received 'special protection' or 'special treatment' because of their victory,"" the court wrote.Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.""We were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,"" a tech reporter told AP.Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk's company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. PingWest had to apologize for a report that claimed Tesla's Shanghai factory was a ""sweatshop"" and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). The AP could not determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com, which drew Tesla's ire after writing about the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla.Electric vehicle giant BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors in going after car owners who suffered crashes.""Tesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,"" said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,000) after he wrote about Tesla's alleged brake failures. ""Tesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.""","Tesla's success in china has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: li qiang, the former party boss of shanghai who is now china's premier. Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it has also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-118181303,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-809598,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Google Pay, a prominent UPI ( Unified Payments Interface ) platform, has begun implementing a convenience fee for utility bill payments , including electricity and cooking gas bills. Previously free for low-value transactions, the service now charges between 0.5% and 1% plus GST for payments made using credit and debit cards. With this, Google Pay now follows some other UPI apps like PhonePe and Paytm that charge similar fee.This development follows the platform's previous implementation of a Rs 3 convenience fee for mobile recharges implemented over a year ago.A review by ET revealed that a customer paid approximately Rs 15 as ""convenience fee"" whilst settling an electricity bill with a credit card. The charge, which included GST, was also described as a ""processing fee for debit and credit card transactions"".An industry insider explained to the financial daily that the introduction of platform fees for bill payments by Google Pay indicates a wider movement towards monetising UPI transactions , as service providers aim to recover payment processing costs.

The platform processed UPI transactions worth Rs 8.26 lakh crore as of January.According to an informed source, charging convenience or platform fees is standard practice in the industry. The source indicated that while Google Pay previously covered this expense, it has now opted to transfer the cost to users.Google Pay's website indicates that while convenience fees apply to card payments, UPI transactions linked directly to bank accounts remain fee-free. The timing of when these charges were introduced remains unclear.For specific bill payments including water, piped gas and electricity, PhonePe implements convenience fees on card transactions, as stated on their website. Similarly, Paytm levies platform fees between Rs 1 to Rs 40 for UPI recharges and various utility bill payments, including gas, water and credit card settlements.UPI's widespread adoption hasn't translated into substantial revenue for fintech firms. PwC's study reveals that processing UPI person-to-merchant transactions costs stakeholders approximately 0.25% of transaction value.

Tesla India entry: Why Donald Trump has said it would be ‘very unfair’ for Elon Musk’s Tesla to set up a factory in India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/tesla-india-entry-why-donald-trump-has-said-it-would-be-very-unfair-for-elon-musks-tesla-to-set-up-a-factory-in-india/articleshow/118386431.cms,"Both Musk and US President Donald Trump have in the past expressed concerns about India's steep import duties on automobiles.

Below is a part of the transcript from the Trump interview available on the official website of the White House:

THE PRESIDENT: And I was doing it — you know, I charged China tariffs. I took in hundreds of billions of dollars, and I was doing that. But when we got — we had the greatest economy in history. But then we got hit with COVID, and we had to solve that problem, because I was doing it — and now I said, I want to come back and do the recipri- — because every country in the world almost — we have a deficit with almost every country — not every one, but just about, pretty close.

And — but every country in the world takes advantage of us, and they do it with tariffs. They makes — make it — it’s impossible for him to sell a car, practically, in, as an example, India. I don’t know if that’s true or not, but I think —

MR. MUSK: The tariffs are like 100 percent import duty.

THE PRESIDENT: The tariffs are so high —

MR. MUSK: Yeah.

THE PRESIDENT: — they don’t want to — now, if he built the factory in India, that’s okay, but that’s unfair to us. It’s very unfair.

And I said, “You know what we do?” I told Prime Minister Modi yesterday — he was here. I said, “Here’s what you do. We’re going to do — be very fair with you.” They charge the highest tariffs in the world, just about.

Q 36 percent?

THE PRESIDENT: Oh, much — much higher.

MR. MUSK: It’s 100 percent on — auto imports are 100 percent.

THE PRESIDENT: Yeah, that’s peanuts. So, much higher. And — and others too. I said, “Here’s what we’re going to do: reciprocal. Whatever you charge, I’m charging.” He goes, “No, no, I don’t like that.” “No, no, whatever you charge, I’m going to charge.” I’m doing that with every country.

MR. MUSK: It seems fair.

Tesla’s India Plans

Tesla India entry : Days after PM Narendra Modi met Tesla CEO Elon Musk, US President Donald Trump has said that any potential plans by the EV maker to build a factory in India would be ‘very unfair’. Trump's comments came as part of a conversation with Elon Musk on Sean Hannity's programme.During the interview, the US President, who commenced his second term in January, highlighted his persistent stance on global exploitation of the US through tariffs. He said, ""...every country in the world takes advantage of us, and they do it with tariffs. They makes — make it — it's impossible for him to sell a car, practically, in, as an example, India. I don't know if that's true or not, but I think —""Musk verified this by saying, ""The tariffs are like 100% import duty,"" to which Trump concurred, describing the tariffs as ""so high.""Both Musk and US President Donald Trump have in the past expressed concerns about India's steep import duties on automobiles.A White House fact sheet indicates that India levies a 100% tariff on US motorcycles, whilst the US imposes merely 2.4% on Indian motorcycles.Trump also said, ""Now, if he built the factory in India, that's okay, but that's unfair to us. It's very unfair.""Also Read | 'More of white noise': Why Trump’s reciprocal tariffs on India’s exports to US will have a ‘limited’ impact According to a TOI report , Tesla plans to import vehicles from its German facility rather than China, addressing Indian government-raised concerns.Multiple state governments, including Gujarat, Tamil Nadu and Telangana, are vying to host the electric vehicle manufacturer's production facility as the company prepares to enter the Indian market through imports initially, followed by domestic manufacturing.Regarding the government's request to avoid Chinese imports, a source told TOI Tesla seems to be aligned with this position, taking into account the diplomatic tensions between India and China. ""German factory in Berlin, which produces Tesla Model Y, will now be used to manufacture right-hand drive cars, which will come to India.""Tesla appears to be making concrete steps towards introducing its electric vehicles to India. Following a recent meeting between Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Elon Musk in the US, Tesla has begun advertising retail positions in Mumbai Sources told TOI that the initial phase will involve importing vehicles for sale through retail outlets in Mumbai and Delhi.This development appears to signal a serious intent from Tesla to establish operations in India, following years of tentative discussions. A planned meeting between Musk and Modi in early 2024 was cancelled at the last moment, but the current progress suggests renewed commitment.Also Read | F-35 fighter: Why India may take the Rafale route to purchase US fifth-generation fighter jets The company has posted 13 vacancies on its website and LinkedIn, covering various customer service and administrative roles in Mumbai. These include a store manager position to oversee sales operations, suggesting plans for a showroom. The company is also seeking staff for delivery operations and customer support. Previously, Tesla had recruited some staff in India but had to terminate their employment when plans were suspended.Tesla, which has been evaluating Indian market opportunities for several years, is anticipated to utilise the EV policy with planned investments between $2 and $3 billion. The company previously indicated its intention to produce an affordable EV in India, targeting a price range of Rs 25-30 lakh, with plans for regional exports. The government views Tesla's proposals favourably, particularly following Apple's successful iPhone manufacturing and export operations in India.Last year's introduction of a new scheme to attract EV manufacturing investments was widely viewed as specifically targeting Tesla. The initiative offered reduced import duties of 15% for electric vehicles if manufacturers invested a minimum of $500 million and commenced production within three years. Companies could import up to 8,000 vehicles annually at this reduced rate.The recent Union Budget's decision to reduce import duty from 100% to 70% on vehicles priced above $40,000 (approximately Rs 35 lakh) may have further influenced Tesla's strategy.Although the basic customs duty decreased by 30%, the replacement of the 10% Social Welfare Surcharge with a 40% Agriculture Infrastructure and Development Cess (AIDC) maintained the overall tax burden.","Both musk and us president donald trump have in the past expressed concerns about india's steep import duties on automobiles.
