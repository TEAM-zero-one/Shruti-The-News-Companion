Half-siblings to control Ratan Tata stake in group companies,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/half-siblings-to-control-ratan-tata-stake-in-group-companies/articleshow/118073994.cms,"MUMBAI: The boards of Ratan Tata Endowment Foundation (RTEF) and Ratan Tata Endowment Trust (RTET), which were bequeathed the late industrialist's shares in Tata companies, are set for restructuring. The three siblings of Ratan Tata - his half-sisters Shireen and Deanne Jejeebhoy and his half-brother Noel Tata - are preparing to join as trustees, indicating that the family will continue to exercise some degree of control over his stake in Tata group companies.RTEF and RTET were established as legal custodians of Ratan Tata's financial investments a couple of years before his demise in October 2024.Ratan Tata owned 0.83% of Tata Sons , the holding company of the group. He also owned stakes in Tata Digital, Tata Motors and Tata Technologies. These shares have been willed to RTEF. He also held considerable investments in startups which will either be sold with proceeds going to RTET or transferred directly to the trust. His estate is estimated to be over Rs 10,000 crore.RTEF functions as a section 8 company, while RTET operates under the Indian Trusts Act. Both organisations focus on supporting education and healthcare and uplifting vulnerable sections of society. They represent the causes closest to the late industrialist and the welfare activities he personally funded. The two trusts will enjoy voting rights proportionate to their stake in Tata group companies.The current two-trustee structure at both organisations will expand to six trustees for RTEF and seven for RTET. Tata Sons chairmanN Chandrasekaran is expected to become managing trustee for both entities, which makes him a guiding force. However, as the Tata Sons' articles of association restrict the chairman from becoming the chairman of any Tata Trust, he cannot chair either organisation.The existing trustees at RTEF are former Tata Sons executive Raghavan Shastri and ex-Tata Realty and Infrastructure director Burzis Shapur Taraporevala. RTET's current trustees include Tata Trusts ' trustees Darius Khambata and Pramit Jhaveri. Khambata and Jhaveri are expected to step down due to their existing commitments with Tata Trusts. Tata Sons legal head Sidharth Sharma will join RTET as a trustee. These are the financial and legal minds within the group.Jamsheed Poncha, from Chandrasekaran's office, is set to be the CEO of both entities. However, unlike Poncha who will receive compensation, Chandrasekaran will not receive payment as managing trustee. This structure represents the first instance of a Tata Trust having both positions simultaneously.The executors of Ratan Tata's will are Shireen and Deanne Jejeebhoy, Darius Khambata, and Tata Trusts trustee Mehli Mistry. Apart from Mistry, all will serve on either or both boards of RTEF and RTET. Emails and messages sent to Noel Tata, who is also the chairman of Tata Trusts, Shireen Jejeebhoy and Deanne Jejeebhoy remained unanswered.",Ratan tata endowment foundation (rtef) and ratan tata trust (rtet) are set for restructuring.

Reports Suggest Elon Musk Might Spend $40M on Super Bowl Ads Targeting Government Waste,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/reports-suggest-elon-musk-might-spend-40m-on-super-bowl-ads-targeting-government-waste/articleshow/118089210.cms,"Image via Getty Images

The Rumors Behind Musk’s Super Bowl Ad Campaign

Tesla and Electric Vehicles – The Super Bowl could be the perfect stage for Musk to unveil Tesla’s latest advancements, such as the highly anticipated Roadster 2.0 or new self-driving capabilities.



X (formerly Twitter) and Free Speech – Musk has repeatedly positioned X as a platform for unrestricted speech. A Super Bowl ad could promote its vision as the ""everything app.""



Dogecoin and Cryptocurrency – Musk has long been a supporter of Dogecoin. A playful ad could reinforce his support for the cryptocurrency, potentially driving up its value.



SpaceX and the Future of Space Travel – A teaser for the first human mission to Mars or a futuristic ad about space tourism would undoubtedly capture global attention.



Will Musk Attend Super Bowl LIX?

As the excitement builds for Super Bowl LIX , speculation is swirling about whether billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk will make a surprise appearance in the coveted lineup of commercials. The Tesla and SpaceX CEO, known for his unconventional marketing strategies and social media presence, is rumored to be spending a staggering $40 million on multiple Super Bowl ads. But is there any truth to these claims? Here’s what we know so far.Super Bowl commercials are among the most expensive advertising slots in the world, with millions tuning in to watch the spectacle. This year, a viral tweet from a user suggested that Musk is planning to run five commercials during the game, allegedly targeting government spending inefficiencies, particularly through the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID).Musk has been vocal in his criticism of USAID, calling it a ""viper’s nest of radical-left Marxists"" and questioning its funding. His newly formed Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) has reportedly been working to expose what he perceives as unnecessary expenditures. While there has been no official confirmation from Musk or his representatives, the billionaire has a history of making bold, unexpected moves, which keeps fans and critics on edge.If Musk were to air a Super Bowl ad, it would likely focus on one of his flagship ventures. Here are a few possible themes:Beyond the ad speculation, there is curiosity about Musk’s presence at the game. He has attended the last two Super Bowls, once alongside media mogul Rupert Murdoch and later with his son, X Æ A-12. With former U.S. President Donald Trump making history as the first sitting president to attend a Super Bowl, many wonder if Musk will follow suit, especially given his growing political influence.Whether or not Musk’s ads air during the game, one thing is certain—his presence, both physically and digitally, will be felt at Super Bowl 2025.","Elon musk is rumored to be spending a staggering $40 million on multiple super bowl ads.

Anna Congdon’s Old Tweets Spark Controversy Just Before the Super Bowl

“I ain’t saying she a gold digger, but she ain’t messin’ with no broke n—gas.”

“#Replace A DisneyMovieWithN—. The Cheetah N—.”

“S—t, you’re right. It’s The Cheetah Girls #TheCheetahN—S.”

“thoroughly enjoyed calling my mom n-gga.”

The Internet Reacts—Criticism, Defenses, and Calls for Saquon Barkley to Stay Focused

Timing is Everything—Why Is This Resurfacing Now?

The internet has a long memory, and right now, it’s turning against Anna Congdon , fiancée of Philadelphia Eagles running back Saquon Barkley . Just as the NFL world shifts its focus to the upcoming Super Bowl, Congdon has found herself at the center of controversy.Old tweets from over a decade ago have resurfaced, and they’re sparking major backlash online. The posts, which reportedly contain racial slurs—including the N-word in Disney movie titles—have ignited a wave of criticism, with many questioning her past actions and calling for accountability. Social media users wasted no time in digging up the problematic content, leading to heated discussions about whether past mistakes should define a person today.Screenshots from 2012 and 2013, when Congdon was around 13 years old, have been making rounds online, showing her casually using offensive language in tweets. Some of the resurfaced posts include:A play on Kanye West’s “Gold Digger” lyrics, where she wrote,A hashtag game where she swapped words in Disney movie titles with racial slurs, such asWhen a friend pointed out she should add an “s,” she doubled down, replying,A tweet from 2013 where she said sheThis isn’t the first time these tweets have surfaced. Back in 2018, when the controversy initially blew up, Congdon swiftly deleted most of her Twitter history before 2015. However, with screenshots resurfacing now, the internet is once again divided. Some are calling her out for the language, while others argue that these were tweets from her teenage years and should be left in the past.Another major talking point? Her biracial children. Some commenters are now questioning whether she still uses such language in private, especially around her kids. Meanwhile, Barkley’s supporters are urging him to ignore the drama and focus on his Super Bowl run.Interestingly, the timing of this scandal isn’t random. It comes just as Congdon’s recent engagement to Barkley was revealed—though reports say the proposal actually happened six months ago. Whether the timing is a coincidence or calculated, the controversy is stealing headlines right before one of the biggest moments in Barkley’s career.For now, neither Barkley nor Congdon has publicly addressed the resurfaced tweets. But in the world of social media, nothing stays buried forever.Also read - Bill Belichick & Jordon Hudson Spark Engagement Rumors with Two Rings—She Addresses One, But What About the Other?","Anna congdon’s old tweets from over a decade ago have resurfaced, sparking major backlash online.

Super Bowl LIX 2025 Commercials: What Are the Most Expensive Ads & Celebrity Endorsements This Year?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/super-bowl-lix-2025-commercials-what-are-the-most-expensive-ads-celebrity-endorsements-this-year/articleshow/118079129.cms,"Image via Getty Images

Millions of Americans will watch the 2025 Super Bowl on Sunday to watch the championship game and watch big-budget commercials from major advertisers. Companies are teasing their spots or releasing early ads to generate buzz before the game between the Philadelphia Eagles and Kansas City Chiefs.Super Bowl LIX in New Orleans is expected to reach more than 120 million viewers on February 9, a record for the most-viewed television event of the year. Ad prices have hit a record as the highest ever, with some spots selling for $8 million or more and even $8 million-plus for 30 seconds while last year's game had charged a 30-second spot at a tune of $7 million.Super Bowl ad costs have risen from $7 million to $8 million this year, excluding production, media buys, talent, and other budget line items. This could be a challenge for smaller brands or those that do not have the financial capacity to pay for a one-time spot, as the original price tag is $7 million. Last-minute advertisers are quoted as asking for an additional $8 million.January Digital's Drabicky suggests that advertisers justify high Super Bowl ad costs by presenting big news, such as a product launch or movie premiere, to justify the high costs. “This is not a good idea for small brands that don’t have the financial means: Better said, I would not mortgage the future of your brand on a single spot,” he added.For example, this year Little Caesars pizza is resuming its Super Bowl ad campaign for its new Crazy Puffs product, while Avocados From Mexico, a regular Super Bowl advertiser, is opting for a digital play over a traditional spot, according to Jasmine Dadlani, chief strategy officer at McKinney. “Big news equals the Big Game,” she said.Also Read: Patrick Mahomes vs. Jalen Hurts: Who Has the Edge in Super Bowl LIX?

Accenture is rolling back its diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) goals, citing changes in the US political landscape, according to an internal memo from CEO Julie Sweet.The decision follows recent executive orders issued by President Donald Trump targeting DEI programs across the federal government and private sector.As per The Guardian, Sweet stated that Accenture would start “sunsetting” its 2017 diversity goals, along with career development programs for “people of specific demographic groups.”The memo also mentioned that DEI policies would no longer be used to assess employee performance and that the company would stop submitting data to external diversity benchmarking surveys.Accenture joins other major companies, including Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon, in scaling back their DEI initiatives. Google also recently rolled back its diversity hiring targets, citing compliance with Trump’s executive orders.Accenture, which employs around 799,000 people globally, had previously committed to gender and racial diversity targets. Women currently represent 48% of the company’s workforce and hold 30% of managing director positions, according to its latest annual report.Sweet also noted that Accenture would “evaluate external partnerships on diversity as part of refreshing our talent strategy.”The rollback aligns with broader corporate shifts as conservative activists and legal pressures challenge DEI-focused policies in the US.","The decision follows recent executive orders issued by president donald trump targeting dei programs across the federal government and private sector.

LONDON: Thames Water , which serves 16 million customers in and around London, is seeking court approval for up to 3 billion pounds ($3.7 billion) of emergency funding to prevent the cash-strapped company from falling into government administration.The high court in London began a four-day hearing on the financing package on Monday, with Thames Water facing off against smaller creditors who complain that the deal is too expensive and favors bigger investors. Creditors holding about 90 per cent of the company's debt have already backed the deal.Without the funding, Thames Water will run out of money in March, which could force the government to temporarily nationalize the company. Both the government and Thames Water say water will continue flowing to customers regardless of what happens.Thames Water, which has about 17 billion pounds ($20.9 billion) of debt and has been repeatedly cited for illegal sewage spills, is at the center of a nationwide backlash over rising water bills as Britain seeks to modernize its water and sewage systems to cope with climate change and a growing population.The company has been the focus of criticism from consumers and politicians who say Thames Water created its own problems by paying overly generous dividends to investors and high salaries to executives while failing to invest in pipelines, pumps and reservoirs. Company executives say the fault lies with regulators who kept bills too low for too long, starving the company of the cash it needed to fund improvements.Ofwat, which regulates water companies in England and Wales, in December approved a 35 per cent increase in Thames Water's consumer charges over the next five years.

China's economy gets New Year boost from holiday travel and shopping,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinas-economy-gets-new-year-boost-from-holiday-travel-and-shopping/articleshow/117980640.cms,"Chinese New Year

BEIJING: China's sluggish domestic consumption got a boost over the weeklong Lunar New Year holiday , with travel and retail sales both offering a slight reprieve to a dragging economy facing the prospect of an escalating US trade war.Train stations and airports across the country were jam-packed for weeks as millions returned home for the festive period in an annual migration that is expected to be a record.Official data showed there were 500 million domestic tourist trips during the eight-day holiday period, commerce ministry spokeswoman He Yongqian said Thursday.That's a 5.9 per cent jump from the same period last year, when travel numbers returned to pre-pandemic levels.Meanwhile, sales of ""key retail and catering services nationwide"" were also up, by 4.1 per cent compared to last year, He Yongqian told reporters in Beijing.The government has struggled to get China's billion-strong army of consumers to inject cash into the economy as a prolonged real estate crisis weighs on confidence.But last month, policymakers expanded a subsidy scheme for common household items, from water purifiers and refrigerators to laptops and electric vehicles.During the holiday period, sales of household appliances and communication equipment at ""key monitored retail enterprises"" were up more than 10 percent year-on-year, according to the commerce ministry.China recorded five per cent growth in gross domestic product last year, among the slowest in decades.Beijing will likely look to hit the same goal of ""around five per cent"" in 2025 but that could be hindered by threats of an escalating trade war.At the weekend, US President Donald Trump announced additional tariffs of 10 percent on all Chinese imports, with Beijing hitting back immediately with tariffs of its own, targeting coal and gas.","500 million domestic tourist trips during the eight-day holiday period.

Bajaj Auto to ride into e-rickshaw segment by end of ongoing fiscal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bajaj-auto-to-ride-into-e-rickshaw-segment-by-end-of-ongoing-fiscal/articleshow/118083501.cms,"NEW DELHI: Bajaj Auto is gearing up to enter the domestic e-rickshaw segment by the end of this fiscal to tap a 'sizable opportunity' in a fast-growing but highly unorganised market, according to a top company official. The company expects to get regulatory clearances towards the end of the ongoing quarter for its e-rickshaw that will enable it to enter the segment which is about 45,000 units a month, Bajaj Auto Executive Director Rakesh Sharma told analysts.""By the end of this financial year, we also intend to launch a modern 'e-rick', which will set an absolutely new standard in the segment and bring a very high level of satisfaction to both owners and passengers.The e-rick segment is almost as large as the auto segment and the new e-Rick should generate new business, he said.When asked for the exact timeline, Sharma said, ""We expect to launch the e-rick by the end of this quarter, let's say, by the end of the FY25 fiscal. By the time all the permissions are through, it may just spill over into the first week of April or retails may spill over to the first week of April or they may just commence by the end of March even.Explaining the rationale behind the move, he said, ""It (e-rickshaw) is a sizable opportunity. We don't sell anything in it. Almost 50 per cent of three-wheeled mobility is in the e-rick space, which is in the north and east, little parts of west.He further said, ""Almost 45,000 e-ricks are retailed every month and they come in various shapes and sizes. It's a very fragmented market. A lot of it is import-dependent. A lot of it is a substandard product but it's a very good format for certain use cases.Stressing that the demand is there, Sharma said, ""By introducing our e-rick, we hope to organise this market and bring in fresh new business for us. I guess we will start to see a real scale-up in the first quarter of the new fiscal.""On the company's electric scooter Chetak , he said Bajaj Auto expects to increase market share in the electric two-wheeler segment on the back of the newly introduced '35 platform' that provides a ""higher range, advanced displays, faster charging and best-in-class boot space"".""This already introduced two variants should make a strong play for higher market share in the upper half of this EV segment where our presence has been relatively weak. The new series will also have a very positive impact on the bottom line, too,"" Sharma said.Sharma further said, ""A major swing into the profitability zone will be achieved in Q4 as the 35-Series acquires scale beginning February.""The combination of the new platform, which will be further expanded in this quarter, and the continually expanding exclusive stores currently over 250 and wider distribution to over 3,000 sales points will continue to drive the business towards a stronger leadership position and on a profitable basis, he said.","Bajaj auto expects to get regulatory clearances towards the end of the ongoing quarter for its e-rickshaw.
