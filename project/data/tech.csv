Jordon Hudson sparks buzz with purse full of crumpled papers during Bill Belichick’s UNC game appearance,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jordon-hudson-sparks-buzz-with-purse-full-of-crumpled-papers-during-bill-belichicks-unc-game-appearance/articleshow/123776329.cms,"Jordon Hudson at the UNC game (BACKGRID)

Jordon Hudson fuels speculation with mysterious game-day accessory



Jordon Hudson continues to craft her own narrative



When Jordon Hudson showed up at Bill Belichick’s latest UNC game, she wasn’t just cheering from the stands—she appeared to be making a statement. The 24-year-old former cheerleader, often in the spotlight for her bold fashion choices and subtle digs at critics, carried a clear purse that had everyone talking. Inside were crumpled papers, highlighted notes, and even what looked like contracts—items too deliberate to be accidental.Hudson has been a consistent presence during Belichick’s early days at the University of North Carolina, but it’s her bag, not her outfits, that’s now fueling conversation. At the Tar Heels’ season opener against TCU, she sported a snakeskin ensemble and a clear bag filled only with folded papers. A week later, against UNC-Charlotte, she carried the same purse—but again, no wallet, phone, or lip gloss, just layers of paper with certain words highlighted.Among the visible notes were fragments like “anything with any,” and references to “moral rights” and “fictional,” sparking guesses that Hudson was addressing rumors or disputes in her own cryptic way. A neon-yellow highlighter sat inside the purse as well, making the setup seem even more intentional.While the meaning behind the items remains unclear, the display seemed too curated to dismiss as coincidence.For Hudson, these choices aren’t entirely surprising. She has often used fashion, emojis, and even Taylor Swift lyrics to communicate without saying much at all. Her social media is filled with snakeskin looks, sly captions, and music references that many interpret as subtle messages aimed at detractors. Earlier this year, she teased a “statement coming soon” following backlash over an interview moment, only to later change the caption to “Read it closer this time. ”Whether her purse was a playful metaphor, a quiet clapback, or something more personal, it certainly captured attention. And while Belichick celebrated his first win with UNC in a 20-3 victory over Charlotte, Hudson’s game-day look may have been the real headline. As the Tar Heels prepare to face Richmond, fans won’t just be watching the field—they’ll be keeping an eye on Hudson’s next move.Also Read: Who is JJ McCarthy’s girlfriend Katya Kuropas?

H-1B row and rising anti-India sentiment







With the H-1B visa program emerging as one of the most contentious issues between the US and India, a new analysis revealed the list of companies that increased their use of H-1B visas in 2025. The analysis was done by Newsweek, which claimed that there is no pattern in this increase, as the increase is spread across multiple industries. However, the biggest are from consulting, technology and financial services firms.Going by Newsweek's analysis, Amazon is the single largest H-1B sponsor, followed by JPMorgan Chase, Microsoft, Apple, Meta Platforms. The other five positions among the top 10 companies are held by Cisco Systems, TCS, Visa Technology and Operations, Amazon Web Services and General Motors.But the figures also include visa renewals, which occur every three years for employees hired during the pandemic. The Newsweek report quoted Amazon, citing visa renewals as a factor behind the jump in H-1B numbers. The other reason, they said, was a higher lottery selection rate for legitimate employers.Amazon reported 787 more H-1B approvals in 2025 in comparison with 2024, according to the Newsweek analysis.The number is 721 for JPMorgan Chase, 464 for Microsoft, 329 for Apple and 279 for Meta Platforms.Experts told Newsweek that the figures could be misleading as they include extensions, transfers and cap-exempt petitions. ""The numbers can be quite misleading if you are unfamiliar with the data. The Hub actually reports both new and renewed/extended visas, so the numbers are exponentially higher than for just new visas,"" Jeff Lande, president of the Lande Group, told Newsweek.H-1B is the visa program that allows US companies to hire foreign skilled people. But over the years, it became synonymous with importing cheap labor and India has become one of the major contributors to this program. Amid the ongoing trade war between India and the US, tech workers, MAGA activists raised calls to stop the H-1B program so that Indians can't 'steal' jobs from Americans. The Trump administration is also planning to revamp the H-1B program in a way that companies can't bring in cheap labor for entry roles but can only hire for high-skilled, high-wage top roles.","Analysis of federal data reveals that several us companies increased their use of h-1b visas in 2025.

“We do expect higher latency on some traffic that previously traversed through the Middle East. Network traffic that does not traverse through the Middle East is not impacted. We'll continue to provide daily updates, or sooner if conditions change.”

Microsoft has confirmed that it has resolved issues with its Azure cloud platform after multiple subsea cables in the Red Sea were cut. Earlier, the company warned that the cable cuts were causing increased latency and service disruptions for users in the Middle East and Asia.

I grow little of the food I eat, and of the little I do grow I did not breed or perfect the seeds.

I am moved by music I did not create myself. When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive. I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with.I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being.

How Lucy Guo learnt to earn money as a kid

Google's Great Escape: How ChatGPT Saved the Tech Giant

Lucy Guo , world's youngest self-made billionaire and serial entrepreneur, credits her frugal parents with motivating her to start hustling at a young age. Guo, 30, was recently named Forbes' youngest self-made billionaire with a net worth of $1.3 billion. Her first company, Scale AI, an AI data-labeling firm, was acquired by tech giant Meta for a whopping $25 billion.Today, Lucy Guo is the founder of Passes, a content creator monetization platform launched in 2022. She also founded a venture capital firm, Backend Ventures, in 2019 to invest in early-stage tech startups. Growing up in Fremont, California, with Chinese immigrant parents, Guo was taught the importance of both education and money. ""They threw me into Abacus competitions,"" she told CNBC Make It, adding that she was ""definitely forced to have good academics.""Her focus on academics led her to study computer science and human-computer interaction at Carnegie Mellon University. However, she dropped out after two years, with only a year left to complete her Computer Science degree. This decision was a major disappointment for her parents.""They sacrificed everything to immigrate from China to America to give their kids a better future,"" Guo explained. ""For their kids to suddenly let go of their education when they were almost done was like a slap in the face.""Instead of finishing her degree, Guo pursued the Thiel Fellowship , a program that provides young people with $200,000 to build innovative companies. ""I think they [parents] viewed that as a sign that I didn't love them,"" she said, ""when it was just me making a bet on myself and choosing to optimize for what I thought would be a better future for myself.""Lucy Guo’s parents lived ""a very frugal life,"" but always emphasized the importance of having money. As a result, she started hustling in elementary school. ""I would find ways to make money on the playground,"" she said. This included trading and selling Pokémon cards, colored pencils, and ""anything I could find.""Her parents were strict, and if she misbehaved, they would take her money away. In response, Guo, in second grade, went to Home Depot to get a debit card and opened a PayPal account to store her cash.As the years went on, her money-making endeavors grew. A fan of the game Neopets, she would sell virtual creatures and in-game currency on forums. ""I would get rare pets, rare items, and resell them for actual cash,"" she said.After discovering engineering and coding, she began making and selling bots to cheat in games. From there, her ventures ""snowballed.""

Treat carbon storage like 'scarce resource': Scientists,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/treat-carbon-storage-like-scarce-resource-scientists/articleshow/123733973.cms,"Representative image

'Scarce resource'





PARIS: The amount of carbon dioxide that can be stored underground is vastly overestimated, new research said Wednesday, challenging assumptions about the ""limitless"" potential this approach holds to reducing global warming Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is complex and costly, and critics say it cannot meet the urgent need to slash planet-heating emissions and meet the world's climate targets.One approach works by avoiding emissions at a polluting source -- such as a factory smokestack. Another, known as direct air capture, pulls CO2 from the atmosphere.But both require the CO2 captured to be injected into rock and locked away underground for centuries or millennia in deep geologic formations.At present, carbon capture plays a vanishingly small part in addressing the climate crisis. But scientists and policymakers consider it a necessary tool to help bring future warming down to safer levels.However, in a new paper published in the prestigious journal Nature, a team of international scientists has sharply revised down the global capacity for safely and practically storing carbon underground.They estimated a global storage limit of around 1,460 billion tonnes of CO2 -- nearly 10 times below scientific and industry assumptions.This ""reality check"" should better inform decision-makers considering carbon capture in their long-term climate policies, the study's senior author, Joeri Rogelj, told AFP.""This is a study that helps us understand -- and actually really corrects -- the working assumption of how much carbon, or CCS capacity, would be available if one takes a practical and a prudent approach,"" said Rogelj, an expert in carbon capture from Imperial College London.To reach this revised figure, the team -- led by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis -- took existing assumptions about carbon storage and ruled out locations deemed risky or economically unviable.This included, for example, injecting CO2 below major civilian centres, into zones of known seismic activity, or many hundreds of metres beneath the oceans.The findings underscored that carbon storage should be treated as ""a scarce resource that needs to be deployed strategically to maximise climate benefits rather than... a limitless commodity"", the study said.This storage limit could be breached by 2200, the authors said, noting they could not account for possible advances in carbon capture, or other technologies, in future.Fully exhausting this capacity could lower global temperatures by 0.7C -- but that should be reserved for future generations who may need it most, the authors said.The IPCC, the UN's expert scientific panel on climate change, says carbon capture is one option for reducing emissions, including in heavy polluting sectors like cement and steel.But it remains infinitesimal: Rogelj said the amount of carbon captured every year at present amounted to approximately one-thousandth of global annual CO2 emissions.","Carbon capture and storage (ccs) is complex and costly.

'Self-preferencing practices': EU fines Google $3.5 billion over ad services; faces global antitrust pressure,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/self-preferencing-practices-eu-fines-google-3-5-billion-over-ad-services-faces-global-antitrust-pressure/articleshow/123723367.cms,"Google hit with $3.5 billion EU fine (AP)

Background: Display ads and competition concerns

Canada and UK also probe Google Ads





European Union regulators on Friday fined Google 2.95 billion euros ($3.5 billion) for breaching competition rules by favoring its own digital advertising services. The penalty marks the fourth antitrust fine the tech giant has faced in the EU.The European Commission, the bloc’s executive branch and top antitrust enforcer, also ordered Google to end its “self-preferencing practices” and take steps to prevent “conflicts of interest” along the advertising technology supply chain.Google said the EU decision was “wrong” and announced plans to appeal. “It imposes an unjustified fine and requires changes that will hurt thousands of European businesses by making it harder for them to make money,” Lee-Anne Mulholland, the company’s global head of regulatory affairs, said in a statement.Mulholland added, ""There’s nothing anticompetitive in providing services for ad buyers and sellers, and there are more alternatives to our services than ever before.”The European Commission began its investigation in June 2021 and found that Google “abused” its dominant positions in the ad-technology ecosystem.Regulators said the company favored its own online display advertising services at the expense of rival publishers, advertisers, and advertising technology services.Online display ads include banners and text that appear on websites and are personalized based on a user’s browsing history.The decision comes more than two years after the commission first announced antitrust charges. While the EU had previously threatened a forced breakup of Google, it has held off on that action for now.“The Commission has already signaled its preliminary view that only the divestment by Google of part of its services would address the situation of inherent conflicts of interest, but it first wishes to hear and assess Google’s proposal,” the commission said. Google has 60 days to respond, after which regulators could propose an “appropriate remedy.”Google is also facing antitrust scrutiny in the US, where prosecutors recently sought to force the company to sell its Chrome browser after a judge found it held an illegal monopoly in online search. The US justice department has asked for a sale of Google’s AdX and DFP ad platforms, tools central to both the EU and US cases.Authorities in Canada and Britain are likewise investigating the company’s digital advertising business.",Google hit with $3.5 billion eu fine for favoring its own digital advertising services. The penalty marks the fourth antitrust fine the tech giant has faced in the eu.

Kuwait’s new social media and advertising rules: what every celebrity and influencer must know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/kuwaits-new-social-media-and-advertising-rules-what-every-celebrity-and-influencer-must-know/articleshow/123765548.cms,"Kuwait’s new Media Law mandates social media influencers to obtain official licenses before advertising, aiming to prevent fraud and misinformation/Representative Image

New social media advertising regulations and influencer licensing





Licensing conditions, content monitoring, and legal enforcement

Consumer protection and addressing misleading influencer ads

Inter ministry coordination and framework for advertising compliance





Kuwait’s Ministry of Information is set to introduce strict regulations requiring celebrities and social media influencers to obtain official licenses before advertising products online. This move, embedded in the forthcoming Media Law, aims to protect consumers from misleading promotions and hold advertisers accountable, marking a significant shift in the country’s approach to social media marketing.Kuwait’s government is preparing to implement comprehensive rules targeting social media advertising, particularly focusing on celebrities and influencers. These new measures, forming part of the draft Media Law currently under final legal review, will mandate all individuals and companies promoting products on platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and Facebook to secure official advertising licenses.The Ministry of Information, working closely with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, will oversee the licensing process. Advertisers must prove that the products or services they promote are legally approved by the relevant authorities. For example, medical products require clearance from the Ministry of Health, while real estate promotions must receive approval from the Ministry of Commerce and Industry.The draft Media Law dedicates two chapters to the regulation of advertising, laying out detailed conditions for licensing and penalties for violations. The Ministry of Information will have full authority to monitor social media content related to advertisements and will refer any suspected breaches to the Public Prosecution for legal action.A key part of the regulation involves the formal verification of influencer accounts. Those wishing to advertise must submit electronic applications, including their account details, personal identification documents, and sign a pledge to comply with all advertising rules. The Ministry will evaluate accounts based on factors such as audience size and influence to determine if they fall under the law’s scope.The new regulations respond to increasing consumer complaints about deceptive influencer promotions, especially in sensitive sectors like health products and real estate. There have been notable court cases stemming from false advertising that left many consumers defrauded. The government aims to eliminate such fraudulent practices by enforcing licensing and oversight.Advertisers will be given a grace period to adjust and regularize their activities under the new system. After this window closes, any violation will lead to strict legal consequences without exception. The regulations cover all advertising formats — visual, written, and printed — ensuring comprehensive control over promotional content across all platforms.The Ministries of Information, Commerce and Industry are coordinating closely to ensure smooth implementation. This includes developing a clear vision for celebrity and corporate advertising that holds all parties accountable without bias and safeguards consumer rights.Once enacted, the law will require social media influencers, celebrities, and companies to follow transparent advertising rules, verifying licenses for the products and services they promote. This regulatory framework represents a major step toward creating a more trustworthy and legally compliant advertising environment in Kuwait’s fast-growing digital market.","Kuwait’s new media law mandates social media influencers to obtain official licenses before advertising, aiming to prevent fraud and misinformation.

UAE telecom providers confirm slowed services

“Dear valued customers, you may experience slowness in data services due to an interruption in the international submarine cables. Our technical teams are currently working to address the issue. We will keep you updated with the latest developments as they occur.”

Regional scale of the disruption and technical context

“A series of subsea cable outages in the Red Sea has degraded internet connectivity in multiple countries… the incident is attributed to failures affecting the SMW4 and IMEWE cable systems near Jeddah.”

Causes, risks, and timeline for recovery





A major undersea cable disruption in the Red Sea has triggered widespread internet slowdowns across the UAE and several parts of the Middle East since Saturday, September 6, 2025. UAE telecom providers du and Etisalat (e&) confirmed the issue, which has also impacted Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform, leading to latency in network services. While providers are working on alternate routing and mitigation, full restoration could take time.On Saturday, September 6, a series of cable outages in the Red Sea severely disrupted internet infrastructure relied upon by multiple Middle Eastern countries, including the UAE. The incident, which began at 5:45 UTC (9:45am UAE time), has been confirmed by Microsoft and regional telecom providers as a result of undersea fibre cuts.Microsoft, which operates Azure, the world’s second-largest cloud computing platform after Amazon Web Services—reported increased latency in traffic routes traversing the Middle East. Although the company rerouted network traffic via alternate paths to avoid a full outage, users have still experienced a noticeable slowdown.Microsoft said in a statement on its website.Microsoft committed to providing daily updates, or sooner if conditions change, and clarified that traffic not routed through the Middle East remains unaffected.Telecom operators e& (Etisalat) and du, the two main service providers in the UAE, acknowledged the impact of the Red Sea cable cuts on their services.Etisalat, in a public statement issued via social media on Sunday, said:du released a similar message, saying:“Dear Valued Customers, You may experience some slowness in our data services due to an International submarine cable cut. Our technical teams are working with international providers to resolve the issue. We will keep you updated with the latest developments.”Both operators assured customers that restoration efforts are underway, although specific timelines were not provided.Between 6pm on Saturday, September 6 and 3am on Sunday, September 7, users across both networks reported major slowdowns or complete unavailability of internet services, according to data from Downdetector.The effect of the outage extended well beyond the UAE, with slowdowns also reported in countries such as India and across the wider Middle East.According to NetBlocks, a global internet observatory tracking cyber infrastructure:The SMW4 (SEA-ME-WE 4) and IMEWE cables are among the major subsea systems that handle vast amounts of internet traffic between Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Their disruption left a significant portion of regional traffic needing rerouting.NetBlocks also noted visible slowdowns across both du and Etisalat networks on Saturday evening, with intermittent access and poor speeds experienced by users.While Microsoft Azure managed to avoid complete disruption by activating alternate routes, the rerouting has still led to noticeable lag and service degradation in data-intensive applications and cloud-based platforms.While the exact cause of the cable damage remains unclear, historical data shows that around 70% of undersea cable incidents are caused by ship anchors, accidental rather than deliberate. Nonetheless, there have been ongoing fears about the vulnerability of cables in the Red Sea, particularly with the Houthi conflict in Yemen. Although the group has denied targeting cables, the region remains geopolitically sensitive.Subsea cable repairs are logistically complex and can take several weeks, involving the deployment of specialised ships and crews to locate and mend the damage.As of Sunday morning, September 7, some services in the UAE showed signs of improvement, although user reports on DownDetector.ae indicated continued instability. Neither the UAE government nor regulators have issued formal statements on the incident as of now.","Users across the uae reported internet slowdowns and outages between 6pm on september 6 and 3am on september 7, data shows.
