'All Indians from India': NYU graduation video triggers major row; 'too much brown',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/all-indians-from-india-nyu-graduation-video-triggers-major-row-too-much-brown/articleshow/123312786.cms,"A video of NYU graduates went viral as social media users hinted that there were hardly any Americans.

Poll Do you think diversity among graduates entering the workforce is a strength? Yes, it brings fresh perspectives No, it affects local opportunities





A video of NYU students sharing their joy of joining jobs straight after their graduation turned into a controversial one as social media users pointed out that almost none of the students interviewed in the video were American. While many users complained that all of them were Indians, all of them were not Indian but mostly all of them were Asians. The video did not reveal their names and all assumptions were based on the appearance and the accent of the graduates.""NYU just posted a video of where their graduates are heading to work after college. Anyone notice anything in this video?"" the video meant for rage-bait was captioned. Many users did not take the bait and said they all looked like America-born immigrants and there was nothing wrong about it. Some, in fact, pointed out the lack of diversity in their jobs, showing they are not interested in other fields.""Nice dog whistle. The reason the US is an economic powerhouse is because of it’s cognitively elite immigrants. But yeah, keep being mad at them,"" one wrote. ""All of them must be sent back. We must reclaim our universities for Americans,"" another wrote.""Can someone please explain how these foreigners get into this school, the how can they afford it? After they got here to this country and got into this school and all that good stuff , how do they get jobs in the biggest companies on earth? I was born in Brooklyn , I can’t even get a job at Burger King.Asking for a friend thanks,"" one wrote.""Why is America educating its enemies? I’ve heard that they also get scholarships and aid. What are we doing here?"" one comment read.""All the Indians are from India with accents not American born and they’re taking jobs away from American born graduates,"" a user wrote.""Too much brown. And a lot of purple,"" one wrote, purple being the color of their graduation robe.With the big tech companies announcing major layoffs this year, all eyes are on the hirings and how much of it actually goes to American graduates. The comments point to a larger surge of anti-immigrant feeling, directed mainly at South Asians, amid disputes surrounding skilled immigration and H-1B visa policies.","A video of nyu graduates went viral as social media users hinted that there were hardly any americans.

NHL trade rumors heat up as Carey Price’s contract linked to potential Chicago Blackhawks deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-rumors-heat-up-as-carey-prices-contract-linked-to-potential-chicago-blackhawks-deal/articleshow/123313471.cms,"The Montreal Canadiens could finally be on the verge of moving Carey Price’s massive contract (Getty Images)

Why the Blackhawks make sense as a landing spot for Carey Price's contract

What Montreal gains — and the steep price they’d pay



The Montreal Canadiens could finally be on the verge of moving Carey Price’s massive contract — and the Chicago Blackhawks might be the team to make it happen. With Price’s deal entering its final year and carrying a $10.5 million cap hit, a proposed trade scenario has emerged that could benefit both sides while reshaping their near-term plans.The Chicago Blackhawks currently sit just over $6 million above the salary cap floor and are expected to move several veterans by the trade deadline. Taking on Carey Price’s contract would give them a financial cushion and strategic flexibility. Analyst Tab Bamford suggests a swap in which Chicago would receive Price’s contract, along with Montreal’s 2026 and 2027 first-round picks, in exchange for goaltender Laurent Brossoit, forward Lukas Reichel, and three second-round picks spread across 2026 and 2027.For Chicago, the move would create a stockpile of draft capital — including three first-rounders in 2026 — giving them “enough ammo to do something significant” in the future. And if the Hawks decide to make a big splash in free agency, Price’s and Shea Weber’s contracts could be placed on LTIR, unlocking more than $18 million in extra cap space.From Montreal’s perspective, adding Brossoit would address a current depth issue behind starter Samuel Montembeault.As Bamford bluntly put it, “Right now, their backup is Kaapo Kahkonen — who is not good.” Brossoit’s career .911 save percentage (.927 last season with Winnipeg) and Stanley Cup-winning experience with Vegas in 2023 make him an immediate upgrade.Reichel, meanwhile, is a 23-year-old former first-round pick who hasn’t found his stride in Chicago. A fresh start in Montreal could unlock his potential, especially in a system eager to develop young forwards.The challenge for the Canadiens would be the heavy draft pick sacrifice — having already moved both 2025 first-rounders in the Noah Dobson trade, losing their ’26 and ’27 selections would test their long-term asset management.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Connor McDavid linked to Maple Leafs and $3.5B Rangers if Oilers extension talks stall Still, if Montreal believes Brossoit and Reichel can contribute immediately, and if shedding Carey Price’s cap hit accelerates their rebuild, this could be the kind of high-risk, high-reward move that changes their trajectory.",The montreal canadiens could finally be on the verge of moving carey price’s massive contract.

GPT-5 Unlocked: From College Student to PhD Expert!

Parag Agrawal , former CEO of Twitter, has embarked on a new chapter in his tech journey, after the public dismantling of Twitter and its transformation into X under Elon Musk . He’s now at the helm of Parallel Web Systems , an AI startup that aims to change how AI agents perform real-world tasks for humans on a computer, acting much like a digital assistant. According to a report by Bloomberg, following his unceremonious firing by Tesla CEO, his friends and former colleagues urged him to take a much-needed break from the intense Twitter saga, but Agrawal chose a different path.“I’m not a person that can enjoy the beach in that moment,” Agrawal shared, showing his immediate drive to build anew. He immersed himself in intense meetings at a Palo Alto coffee shop, delving into research papers, writing code and creating the startup from his laptop.Agrawal said that he received numerous job offers but most were uninspiring, asking him to “clean up shit,” as he put it. With his extensive background in building machine learning systems at Twitter, Agrawal was convinced his next venture had to be in AI.He said that just a month after his departure from Twitter, OpenAI launched ChatGPT , opening opportunities for artificial intelligence startups, with companies like Anthropic PBC rapidly expanding.Parallel Web Systems is developing infrastructure that empowers AI agents—think of them as smart tools capable of handling complex computer tasks on your behalf. The core of Parallel's innovation lies in helping these AI agents efficiently search the web for the most accurate information.This capability is often the critical difference between an AI agent successfully completing a task and failing altogether, ensuring the tools can deliver on their promise.Agrawal's new endeavor has already garnered significant attention, successfully raising $30 million in funding. Notable investors include billionaire Vinod Khosla through his firm, Khosla Ventures . Agrawal now leads a 25-person team from a Palo Alto office, not far from where he first incorporated the company on his laptop.“I don’t think Twitter defines me. If I do a good job, I’m hoping this company will define me,” Agrawal says of his new role. Agrawal – a former International Physics Olympiad gold medalist with a doctorate in computer science from Stanford University – steadily climbed the ranks at Twitter over more than a decade.Starting as an engineer on the advertising team, he eventually rose to become Chief Technology Officer under then-CEO Jack Dorsey. His contributions included work on core products like Twitter’s initial advertising technology and its algorithmic timeline. He was appointed Dorsey's successor in late 2021.","Parag agrawal, former ceo of twitter, has embarked on a new chapter in his tech journey.

Sridhar Vembu , the co-founder and chief scientist of Zoho Corporation , has provided valuable insights into the evolving role of artificial intelligence (AI) in modern workplaces and business processes. He acknowledges AI’s immense potential to accelerate learning, streamline workflows, and enhance overall product and service experiences, making operations more efficient and data-driven. However, Vembu cautions that over-reliance on AI, misuse, or unmonitored implementation can reduce, or even reverse, the expected productivity gains, creating unforeseen challenges.His perspective underscores the critical importance of responsible AI adoption , emphasising human oversight, ethical considerations, and continuous evaluation of AI systems. By balancing technology with careful management, businesses can harness AI’s advantages while mitigating risks and ensuring sustainable growth.Vembu revealed his personal AI habits in a post on X (formerly Twitter) in August 2025, describing himself as a “moderate to heavy” user.A unique approach he follows is having multiple AI systems debate and critique each other’s outputs, which he believes enhances understanding and critical thinking.Vembu highlighted that AI can significantly enhance product experiences and improve customer service efficiency:Tools like Grok in X show how AI can streamline user interaction and provide quicker solutions.AI can support customer service agents, enabling faster responses and more efficient handling of queries.However, he warns against allowing AI to fully replace human agents. Passing off AI-generated responses as human without disclosure is unethical and risks damaging trust.Vembu emphasised that AI should assist rather than replace human creativity:He advises against using AI to create original content independently.Copying and pasting AI-generated responses without human review or disclosure is considered unprofessional.AI is a tool to augment human intelligence, not a substitute for critical thinking, creativity, or decision-making.Vembu also discussed AI in software development, pointing out potential risks and limitations:AI-generated code must undergo comprehensive compliance, privacy, and security reviews. Skipping these processes can undermine software quality, compromise security, and violate professional standards.In some instances, these verification steps may eliminate much of AI’s time-saving advantage, and improper use could even slow development.Zoho programmers are encouraged to use AI for learning and problem-solving, but not as a complete replacement for human coding judgement.Vembu’s philosophy focuses on moderation, experimentation, and evaluation:Use AI to enhance productivity, learning, and problem-solving, not as a full substitute for human expertise.Conduct experiments, gather real-world data, and refine AI practices based on outcomes.Ensure human oversight and ethical responsibility in all AI-driven processes.This approach ensures AI serves as a complement to human skill, fostering innovation while maintaining accountability.","Sridhar vembu is the co-founder and chief scientist of zoho corporation.

Speaking in a recent ‘Decoder’ podcast, the GitHub CEO said that it is clear that GitHub is non-negotiable for employees at the company. “There is no world where I would allow employees to say, ‘Well, sorry, I don’t want to use GitHub.’ If that is the case, you can go work somewhere else.” This rule of the company highlights GitHub’s commitment to its own platform which hosts more than 1 billion repositories and also serve more than 150 million developers globally.According to a report by Business Insider, during the recent podcast interview, Thomas Dohmke said that it is a rule at GitHub that all the employees will use the platform. The rule applies to everyone from developers to HR professionals. “There is no world where I would allow for somebody to say, 'Well, sorry, I don't want to use GitHub.'

Nvidia’s China crisis

Lava Blaze AMOLED 2: Budget Smartphone with Mid-Range Vibes

The ongoing dispute surrounding Nvidia’s H20 AI chip sales to China has now intensified discussions about US-China technology arms race . A recent online report revealed that China is pursuing its major tech companies like Alibaba and ByteDance to reconsider their orders for Nvidia’s H20 AI chips even as Chinese regulators have asked tech firms to explain why they are purchasing Nvidia’s chips – which US President Donald Trump called ‘obsolete’ – instead of using domestic alternatives, suggesting that they want the Chinese tech companies to downsize their orders of H20 chips.Following this ongoing controversy, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a blunt warning about America’s vulnerability in the global tech arms race. As reported by Financial Review, speaking at the Reagan National Economic Forum, Dimon called it “a little embarrassing” that the U.S. allowed 100% of its penicillin supply and critical tech components to come from China. “It’s a little embarrassing that we as a nation allowed 100% of our penicillin to come from China, and all of our rare earths, and all of our advanced chipmaking tools,” Dimon said. “We need to get our act together.”On being asked about the technology arms race between US and China, Jamie Dimon mentioned that it was an important miliarty issue as US cannot allow the sale of a chip to China which is designed to make powerful AI systems.Dimon also talked about the dependence of America on foreign nations for essential goods and technology. ""It’s a little embarrassing that we as a nation allowed 100 per cent of our Penicillin to come from China, and all of the rare earth [metals],"" Dimon said.Talking about the ongoing chip dispute, Dimon added that “You don’t want to give them the chips which will make their supersonic missiles better.”Dimon also emphasised that America cannot stop China but can definitely slow them down. “we should be specific about the things that protect us, and technology is a big piece of that,” said Dimon.Dimon’s remarks come as a Nvidia’s H20 chips, designed specifically for the Chinese market, face mounting scrutiny from Beijing. Recently, Chinese regulators summoned Nvidia representatives over alleged security risks related to Nvidia H20 AI chips . However, later Nvidia publicly asserted that its chips contain ""no backdoors, no kill switches, and no spyware.""In a blog post shared, Nvidia’s chief security officer David Reber has vehemently denied the accusations of Chinese government alleging security risks in H20. “There is no such thing as a ‘good’ secret backdoor — only dangerous vulnerabilities that need to be eliminated,” wrote Reber in the blog post. He argued that it would ""undermine global digital infrastructure and fracture trust in US technology.Now the China is asking its tech companies to reconsider their orders for Nvidia’s H20 AI chips. According to a report by Financial Times, the development comes as various Chinese companies have been told to avoid using these AI chips, particularly for government-related projects.This move complicates the recent export arrangement Nvidia made with the Trump administration, which allowed the chips to be sold in China under the condition of a revenue-sharing agreement. According to White House spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, the Trump administration is still finalising the details of its agreement to collect a 15% export tax on revenue from Nvidia and AMD's chip sales to China.","Jpmorgan chase ceo jamie dimon has issued a blunt warning about america’s vulnerability in the global tech arms race.

Amid mass layoffs from major tech companies, the companies have now been accused of bending hiring rules in the local newspaper advertisements that they are mandated to advertise before hiring.

""At a time when unemployment for college graduates is shifting sharply upward, it is important to call out hiring discrimination that could keep Americans unemployed,"" they said.Jobs.Now also said that recruitment for these roles is done separately from the companies standard recruitment process.""These unusual application methods are likely to drive fewer applications than normal processes like posting ads on the company job board or on mainstream career sites like LinkedIn,"" they said.The Newsweek report cited a San Francisco Chronicle advertisement given by OpenAI. It said it was hiring a software engineer but the resumes were to be sent to the ""global mobilty team"".Another tech company, Instacard, offered multiple positions, with a similar department taking applications, while Udemy, an online learning platform, wanted a director of marketing analytics and data science, with resumes to be sent to ""immigration@udemy.com"", the Newsweek report said.H-1B is at the center of a major row going on in the US job market, with the MAGA activists blaming the visa program for the unemployment of the American youth.

"China push: In Nepal, EVs now account for 76% of all vehicles sold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/china-push-in-nepal-evs-now-account-for-76-of-all-vehicles-sold/articleshow/122960428.cms,"



KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Ev market share in nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including norway, singapore and ethiopia.

Four men in Northampton, England, raced away from an Indian restaurant without paying their 200-pound (about Rs 21,000) bill, which led to a spectacular chase by the staff. According to a Daily Mail article, the event took place in the Saffron restaurant at around 10.11 pm on August 4.Men can be seen entering the restaurant in the widely circulated CCTV footage posted on Instagram. Later in the video, they can be seen rushing out of the restaurant's door after leaving their table. When they reveal their intent, a staff member may be seen pursuing them. According to the complaint by the eatery, those men ordered and consumed 197.30 pounds of food, which included lamb chops, several curries, and other dishes.The company later posted the bill on Facebook. The bill breakdown included four plain poppadoms for £5.60, one chutney tray for £2.20, two chargrilled lamb chops for £24.00, three chicken chat dishes for £30.00, two chicken tikka mains for £28.00, two chicken tikka masalas for £32.00, two boiled rice portions for £11.00, two garlic naans for £12.00, three chapatis for £12.00, one serving of chips for £4.50, and nine 330 ml glass bottles of Coke for £36.00.Police in Northamptonshire acknowledged that they are looking into the event as a possible theft.""This kind of behavior isn't just theft; it affects hardworking small businesses and our local community,"" they wrote in a Facebook post.Online, the post generated a range of responses. ""Eat at home if you can't afford it! One user asked, ""Why are people these days so lazy to cook?""“This is why you swipe a card before they’re seated. They don’t look like they can afford a McDonald’s, never mind a £200 restaurant bill,"" added the other user.","Four men in northampton, england, raced away from an indian restaurant without paying their 200-pound (about rs 21,000) bill.

National strategy







The world's inaugural humanoid robot games commenced Friday in Beijing, featuring over 500 androids competing in events ranging from the 100-metre hurdles to kung fu. Hundreds of robotics teams from 16 countries vied for gold at the Chinese capital's National Speed Skating Oval, constructed for the 2022 Winter Olympics.The games encompassed traditional sports such as athletics and basketball, alongside practical tasks including medicine categorisation and cleaning. ""I believe in the next 10 years or so, robots will be basically at the same level as humans,"" enthusiastic 18-year-old spectator Chen Ruiyuan told AFP.Human athletes may not be intimidated at this stage. During one of the initial events on Friday morning, five-aside football saw ten robots the size of seven-year-olds maneuver around the pitch, frequently becoming entangled in scrums or toppling over en masse.However, in a 1500-metre race, domestic champion Unitree's humanoids maintained an impressive pace, easily surpassing their competitors. The fastest robot AFP observed completed the race in 6:29:37, considerably slower than the human men's world record of 3:26:00. In one incident, a mechanical racer crashed into a human operator. The robot remained upright, while the human was knocked to the ground but did not appear to be injured.Robot competitions have been held for decades, but the 2025 World Humanoid Robot Games marks the first to concentrate specifically on robots that resemble human bodies, organisers stated.The Chinese govt has invested heavily in robotics with the aim of leading the industry. Beijing has placed humanoids at the ""centre of their national strategy,"" the International Federation of Robotics stated in a paper on Thursday.""The govt wants to showcase its competence and global competitiveness in this field of technology,"" it added. Authorities are endeavouring to raise awareness of the sector across society.Cui Han, accompanying her 10-year-old son, told AFP that her son's school had organised and funded the trip to the Games. ""I hope it will encourage him to learn more about these new technologies,"" she said. In March, China announced plans for a one-trillion-yuan (approx Rs 1,22,000 crore) fund to support technology startups, including those in robotics and AI. The country is already the world's largest market for industrial robots, official statistics indicate, and in April, Beijing held what organisers described as the world's first humanoid robot half-marathon.","World's inaugural humanoid robot games commenced friday in beijing, featuring over 500 androids.

A new approach to malaria modelling

Scientific Reports

“Analysis of a Mathematical Model for Malaria Using a Data-Driven Approach”

Technologies at the core: AI and dynamic systems

Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs)



Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)



Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs)





Implications for global health

This research demonstrates the power of AI when combined with classical epidemiological models,” said Prof. Abdessamad Tridane of UAEU. “By embedding environmental dependencies directly into the transmission functions, our model captures the complex, real-world behaviour of malaria spread, providing a more accurate and timely method for disease tracking.”

Institutional collaboration and background

United Arab Emirates University (UAEU), established in 1976 in Al Ain, is the UAE’s oldest public research university. Founded by Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, it offers a wide range of undergraduate and postgraduate programs across multiple disciplines.





IIT Madras Zanzibar Campus, inaugurated in November 2023, is the first international campus of the Indian Institute of Technology Madras. Located in the Bweleo district of Zanzibar, Tanzania, the campus currently offers programs in Data Science and Artificial Intelligence. It aims to cater to a diverse student population from India, Tanzania, and other African nations, with plans to broaden its academic scope in the coming years.







In a significant step forward for global public health, researchers from United Arab Emirates University (UAEU) and the Indian Institute of Technology Madras’ Zanzibar campus have introduced a cutting-edge, data-driven framework that accurately models and forecasts malaria transmission. By integrating artificial intelligence with mathematical modelling, this new approach aims to support early intervention and improve disease control strategies in malaria-prone regions.A collaborative research team led by Adithya Rajnarayanan, Manoj Kumar, and Professor Abdessamad Tridane has introduced a novel methodology that enhances how malaria outbreaks can be forecasted. Their work, published inby Nature, presents a comprehensive model that combines artificial intelligence (AI) with classical epidemiological frameworks to simulate malaria dynamics with higher precision.The study, titled, brings a fresh perspective to disease modelling. It incorporates temperature- and altitude-dependent variables into compartmental disease models, a method that makes the simulations more realistic and region-specific. This is particularly crucial for climate-sensitive and vulnerable areas where environmental factors heavily influence malaria transmission patterns.To boost the predictive capability of their model, the researchers employed a suite of advanced AI tools. These included:Each of these tools was used to improve the accuracy of disease forecasting, enabling the model to detect patterns in the complex interplay between environmental conditions and malaria spread.Additionally, the study introduced Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD), a mathematical technique that helps break down complex systems into simpler, understandable components. This was used to create a real-time infection risk metric, offering public health officials a powerful resource for early detection and targeted response.Professor Abdessamad Tridane of UAEU emphasized the importance of this integration of AI with epidemiological modelling, stating:The implications of this research are especially relevant for regions like sub-Saharan Africa, which accounts for 94% of global malaria cases. With over half a million malaria-related deaths each year, the need for accurate forecasting models is critical. This work offers a valuable step towards improved surveillance, early warning systems, and data-driven policymaking in the fight against malaria.This study represents a collaboration between two institutions that are expanding their global health research footprint:","Researchers from united arab emirates university (uaeu) and the indian institute of technology madras’ zanzibar campus have introduced a cutting-edge, data-driven framework that accurately models and forecasts malaria transmission.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123334365,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1427835,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Starting August 18, 2025, UAE citizens will be allowed to renew their passports up to one year before the expiry date, a change from the earlier six-month window. The new rule, issued by the ICP, is part of a broader initiative to enhance travel flexibility, streamline official procedures, and strengthen the UAE passport’s global standing.The Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Ports Security (ICP) has revised the policy governing passport renewals for UAE citizens. As per the latest decision by Ali Mohammed Al Shamsi, Chairman of the ICP, Emiratis will now be permitted to renew their passports once the remaining validity is one year or less. This is a shift from the previous rule that allowed renewals only when six months or fewer were left before expiration.The change will be effective Monday, August 18, 2025, and is applicable to all UAE nationals with eligible passports. The aim is to allow for better advance planning, especially for international travel, while reducing disruptions in official transactions and providing extended use of digital documentation.ICP noted that the new timeline will also support seamless transitions for UAE citizens who travel frequently or are involved in long-term visa procedures abroad.The ICP has confirmed that the renewal process will remain efficient and widely accessible, continuing to focus on digital services to facilitate ease of access. Citizens can complete the entire renewal process online through the ICP smart services platform, accessible via both the official website and mobile application.The online process allows applicants to:For those who prefer or require in-person assistance, customer happiness centers within the UAE will remain available. Additionally, UAE nationals living abroad can submit their applications through UAE embassies and consulates, and they also have the option to initiate the process online and collect the renewed passport from a diplomatic mission.This update comes at a time when the UAE passport continues to see a significant rise in its global ranking and travel privileges. As of 2025, the UAE passport:This is a marked improvement over previous years:Since the Henley Passport Index’s inception in 2006, the UAE passport has added 152 countries to its visa-free or visa-on-arrival list, reflecting the UAE's growing diplomatic ties and international mobility for its citizens.Chairman Al Shamsi highlighted that the UAE passport continues to rank as the world’s most powerful, trusted, and widely recognised travel document. The new decision, he added, is a strong boost to its global standing and further establishes the UAE’s passport issuance and renewal system as a leading model for the region and beyond.In terms of operations, the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs in Dubai has processed 7,425 passport renewals during the first half of 2025 alone. Since the opening of its center in 2008, over 139,000 passports have been issued to Emiratis through that facility.","Uae passport now grants visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 185 countries, ranking it 8th strongest worldwide in 2025.
