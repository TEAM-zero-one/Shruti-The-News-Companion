Theare reportedly holding off on extending Mikal Bridges’ contract this offseason, and it may have everything to do with the uncertainty surrounding Milwaukee Bucks superstarAccording to Ian Begley of SNY, the New York Knicks are one of several teams monitoring the trade situation involving Giannis Antetokounmpo. The decision to delay Bridges’ extension appears tied to maintaining flexibility in the event Giannis becomes available.“The Knicks and all the other teams are kind of keeping an eye on Milwaukee and what may or may not happen there,” Begley said. “I think one of the reasons why (Bridges) has not been extended yet is because once you extend him, you cannot trade him for six months…”This six-month no-trade clause following a player’s extension is a crucial factor. If the New York Knicks extend Bridges now, it would rule him out of any blockbuster trade package until midseason. Given the magnitude of a potential Giannis Antetokounmpo deal, New York is keeping its options open.Antetokounmpo’s future has been a major storyline this offseason. While speculation ramped up earlier this summer, momentum has shifted toward him remaining in Milwaukee.In May, ESPN’s Shams Charania reported that Giannis had not made a firm decision about his future with the Bucks and was “open-minded” about exploring other possibilities. However, things have cooled since then:Feigin further added during a recent NBA TV appearance, “Giannis loves Milwaukee, Milwaukee loves Giannis… We feel great about it.It’s business as usual.”Despite these public reassurances, only Giannis truly knows his next move. The door hasn’t closed completely, which explains why teams like the Knicks remain cautiously hopeful.For New York, a chance to add a player like Giannis Antetokounmpo would transform their status in the league. They’re already a top contender after acquiring Karl-Anthony Towns to pair with Jalen Brunson. Adding Giannis would elevate them from contenders to clear favorites in the East.Until Giannis Antetokounmpo’s future is locked in, it’s logical for the New York Knicks to avoid committing to any moves that might limit trade options—even if that includes a delay in rewarding Bridges with a well-earned contract extension.Mikal Bridges proved to be a valuable addition in his first year with the Knicks. He averaged 17.6 points per game, serving as a reliable third scoring option behind Brunson and Towns.Bridges is currently entering the final year of his four-year, $90.9 million contract. Based on his performance and fit in the Knicks’ system, an extension seems inevitable—just not until the Giannis Antetokounmpo saga reaches its conclusion.New York Knicks’ Calculated Approach Signals Long-Term AmbitionThe Knicks’ management is playing the long game. While Mikal Bridges has shown he’s deserving of a new deal, the front office is prioritizing flexibility—especially with a generational talent like Antetokounmpo potentially in play.Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors Could Land $86.6 Million Orlando Magic Superstar in Bold Three-Team Trade Proposal New York fans may need to be patient, but this strategic pause could pay off massively if it results in a once-in-a-decade acquisition.",Giannis antetokounmpo’s future has been a major storyline this offseason.

Not pretty enough: Tom Brady's ex-wife Gisele Bündchen exposes fashion industry’s brutal bullying for being too ugly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/not-pretty-enough-tom-bradys-ex-wife-gisele-bndchen-exposes-fashion-industrys-brutal-bullying-for-being-too-ugly/articleshow/122731746.cms,"Gisele Bündchen's journey to supermodel stardom wasn't paved with conventional beauty (Getty Images)

Gisele Bündchen spoke openly about her early struggles and childhood insecurities

Success didn’t come from beauty alone — it came from drive, discipline, and determination

Before she was one of the world’s highest-paid and most recognizable supermodels, Gisele Bündchen faced a reality that didn’t align with glossy runways or magazine covers — she was bullied for her appearance. In a candid 2016 interview with The New York Times, Bündchen revealed that her career was not built on conventional beauty but on resilience, energy, and unshakable drive.Years before she ruled the fashion world, Bündchen was a tall, athletic girl from Brazil, often teased by classmates for being skinny, red-faced from volleyball, and having a “big nose.” The model recalled, “My career was never based on pretty. Even before I got into the business, I was used to being bullied because I was always tall and skinny and stuck out.” For Bündchen, bullying became a formative experience — one that shaped her character and drive more than any runway ever could.Her story is far from the fairy tale many imagine. Even after entering the modeling world, she was told her eyes were too small, her nose too big, and that she’d never land on a magazine cover. “But, you know what? The big nose is coming with a big personality,” she quipped. That personality and work ethic would eventually silence critics and turn her into an icon.Bündchen’s success wasn’t accidental. Leaving home at just 14, she was determined to make something of herself — a mindset she credits to her upbringing in a large family of six girls. “I’m a twin, I’m a Cancer, I’m always taking care of other people. I’ve always been the fixer in the family, the responsible one,” she shared. Her discipline was unmatched: “Never late for a job in my life. Really, ask anyone.”nullHer big break came when legendary fashion photographer Patrick Demarchelier cast her for Harper’s Bazaar. Despite skepticism from others on set, Demarchelier remembered her spark clearly: “She was smart and outgoing, always happy... Immediately, right away, you could see that the girl was special.”Also Read: “Stereotypically selfish”: Tom Brady’s fans call out Gisele Bündchen’s ‘victim act’—did her Vanity Fair interview cross the line?

“It's a lot of weird s**t going on”: Kai Cenat breaks silence on growing controversy with xQc,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/news/its-a-lot-of-weird-st-going-on-kai-cenat-breaks-silence-on-growing-controversy-with-xqc/articleshow/122767561.cms,"Image via: Getty Images

Kai Finally Speaks: ‘I Don’t F**k With Somebody’

xQc Responds: ""He wants to Make Everything I Say a Big Deal""

How It Started

What Comes Next?

The rivalry among two of Twitch’s most prominent streamers, Kai Cenat and ""xQc"", just entered the boiling over phase. During a recent live stream, Kai Cenat addressed his xQc beef for the first time, and since the incident, the pair have been wanting to take each other on, and fans across the streaming scene are watching his and Cenat’s every word.In his July 17 livestream, Kai Cenat deviated from the standard shit talking to address speculations regarding his friendships with other streamers, specifically Adin Ross. His demeanor shifted when xQc’s name was mentioned.“I don't even want to mention that n**'s name because y'all guys know the lore behind that. But, n**a, I don't fk with somebody, I'll tell y'all n**s. Like, I don't fk with that n*a. I would tell y'all! It's a lot of weird s*t going on, mud! You feel me?""While cryptic, his remarks validated what a lot of fans had been theorizing for months that the two creators have no love for one another.xQc didn’t hesitate to reply. While viewing Kai’s stream live, the French-Canadian content creator replied live and responded to Cenat’s remarks during his own stream later that day.""He wants to make everything I say a big deal"" xQc said, brushing off the suggestion that he had any ill will. “We’re not even in the same room anymore.”It’s a quote that exposes a larger trend: while both still dominate Twitch viewership and headlines, their content styles and social circles have drifted ever further apart, physically and figuratively.This conflict isn’t precisely recent. The seeds were planted months ago when xQc charged some members of Kai’s AMP group of botting viewers, a grave accusation in the streaming community. Admirers started seeing subtle friction between the two from that point on.The tension reignited recently when xQc took a jab at Cenat for allegedly snubbing Adin Ross, another divisive streamer. The comment appeared cursory to some, it was sufficient to provoke Kai.With both streamers now publicly and negatively talking about each other. As some fans are rooting for a public resolution or even a collab to finish this, others are still enjoying their banter.","Kai cenat and ""xqc"" are two of twitch's most prominent streamers.

What are 'Kiss Cams'

Who are Andy Byron and Kristin Cabot

A 'Kiss Cam' moment broadcast at a Coldplay concert Astronomer CEO Andy Byron and the firm’s chief human resources officer, Kristin Cabot. While featuring loved-up twosomes during the show, a camera panned over to a man who had his arms wrapped tightly around a woman, according to videos online. As soon as the two realised that they were on camera, the dup scrambled to hide their faces. The man, later identified as Andy Bryon, immediately ducked out of view while the woman, Kristin Cabot , hid her face in apparent embarrassment.Their reaction seems to have puzzled Chris Martin, the lead singer of Coldplay, who jokingly said, ""Oh, look at these two. You're all right. You're OK. Oh, what? Either they're having an affair or they're just very shy.""So what are these ""Kiss Cams"" that outed the tech CEO's affair. 'Kiss Cams' at concerts, like those seen at Coldplay shows, are a popular form of audience engagement and entertainment during breaks or lulls in the main performance. Much like those at sporting events, 'Kiss Cams' are a popular interactive segment designed to entertain the audience during lulls or breaks in the show. A camera operator scans the crowd, displaying random audience members on the large video screens (jumbotrons) in the stadium or arena. When the camera zooms in on a pair, the unspoken expectation is for them to share a kiss, often to the cheers and applause of the crowd.While intended as light-hearted fun and a way to foster communal enjoyment, these moments can sometimes lead to unexpected reactions, ranging from shy giggles to viral, awkward encounters. As seen in recent events, frontman Chris Martin might even playfully comment on the on-screen interactions, adding to the impromptu entertainment. The 'Kiss Cam' serves as a simple yet effective tool to engage thousands of concertgoers, transforming passive spectators into active participants in a memorable moment.As per his LinkedIn profile, Andy Byron has been CEO of Astronomer since July 2023. Before this, he has held senior-level roles at cybersecurity and software companies. The US-based Astronomer is valued at $1 billion.

GTA 6: What Konvoy analyst Josh Chapman predicted about GTA 6’s success



“🎮 GTA VI: we predict that GTA VI will generate $7.6 BILLION in revenue in the first 60 Days of its launch (current release date: May 26, 2026). This will be the greatest video game release of all time; shattering player, viewership, and revenue records.

For Take-Two Interactive's $2 billion investment into this game, we believe they will break even on that within 30 days of release (see our breakdown in the chart attached).

🚀 Predictions: Our Expectations of GTA VI:

We chatted internally here at Konvoy and decided to write down a few predictions and make them public. In the end, we're just gamers who can't wait to see this title released:

1️⃣ GTA VI is the largest gaming release of all time, shattering records of copies sold and revenue generated within almost every period of time

2️⃣ GTA VI will cost $80 (there will be premium versions of course, but the base price is $80)

3️⃣ GTA VI is the next UGC platform. It will have a UGC component that includes creator payouts for server hosts, mod creators, and more (mimicking the creator economics of UEFN and Roblox)

4️⃣ GTA VI will have 200-person lobbies, and there will be higher risk/reward dynamics where you can raid and steal items from players more easily

5️⃣ GTA VI will break even on its $2bn investment <30 days of release

6️⃣ GTA VI will hit the attached chart of copies sold, revenue, and player targets.

We can't wait for this title to be released in 2026. I'll certainly be playing it.”

Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason

Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6) is set to launch in May next year. Meanwhile, investment firm Konvoy has made some major predictions for the upcoming open world title’s financial performance. The video game venture capitalist company suggests that GTA 6 will generate $7.6 billion in revenue within just two months or 60 days of its release. Josh Chapman, a managing partner of Konvoy, shared this forecast on a post shared on the professional networking site LinkedIn. He highlighted that the firm believes that the highly anticipated game will have major commercial success. However, it's important to note that Konvoy's projection is based on certain assumptions that Take-Two Interactive has not yet confirmed, such as an $80 price point for the game and a reported budget of around $2 billion, which the company is said to have spent to develop the game.Konvoy's analysis suggests that GTA 6 could recover its estimated $2 billion budget in under 30 days and build considerable momentum. The firm predicts that it may become the gaming industry’s biggest launch to date and is expected to break records for both copies sold and revenue generated by a game. Considering that analysts have referred to GTA 6 as ""the most important game to ever release in the industry,"" a multi-billion dollar revenue figure may be within reach for the title.In his LinkedIn post, Chapman wrote:",Grand theft auto 6 (gta 6) is set to launch in may next year.

Andy Byron , CEO of the high-growth data startup Astronomer , has landed in a controversy after a viral kiss cam moment at a Coldplay concert showed him in a close embrace with Kristin Cabot , the company’s HR chief. The incident, which occurred at Gillette Stadium in Boston, sparked widespread speculation of an affair, especially as both Byron and Cabot are married. With frontman Chris Martin joking, “Either they’re having an affair or they’re very shy,” the clip quickly went viral—thrusting Byron’s personal life and soaring net worth into the public spotlight.Though Byron’s exact net worth isn’t publicly disclosed, it is believed to range between $20 million and $70 million, driven largely by his equity stake in Astronomer, which recently raised $93 million in Series D funding in May 2025. This round was led by Bain Capital and brought the company’s estimated valuation to around $1.2 to $1.3 billion. As CEO, Byron likely owns between 1% and 5% of the company, putting the value of his stake at $12 million to $65 million, not including salary, bonuses, and past earnings from senior roles at Cybereason, Lacework, and Fuze.“Astronomer’s momentum and investor confidence reflect our vision to build a durable software company,” Byron said at the time, noting the firm’s central role in helping enterprises scale AI and optimize data platforms. Despite the growing scandal, Astronomer has not publicly addressed the situation, nor have Byron or Cabot.At the heart of the controversy is a viral moment from Coldplay’s concert, where Byron and Cabot were captured on the kiss cam sharing what appeared to be an intimate exchange. As the crowd laughed and frontman Chris Martin made his cheeky remark, Byron ducked behind a seat and Cabot covered her face. The awkwardness of the moment only fueled affair rumors online.Byron, 50, is married to Megan Kerrigan Byron, an educator at Bancroft School, with whom he has two children. Following the viral video, Megan reportedly dropped “Byron” from her Facebook profile and deactivated her account. Kristin Cabot is married to Kenneth C. Thornby. Despite mounting speculation, neither party has commented, and Astronomer has yet to announce any internal investigation or HR action.Meanwhile, the scandal has drawn attention from the company’s founder and former executives, with some distancing themselves from what’s now dubbed “ColdplayGate.” As the situation continues to unfold, public interest in Byron’s personal and professional life shows no signs of slowing.","Andy byron, ceo of high-growth data startup astronomer, has landed in a controversy.
