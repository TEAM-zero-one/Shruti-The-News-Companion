I grow little of the food I eat, and of the little I do grow I did not breed or perfect the seeds.

I do not make any of my own clothing. I speak a language I did not invent or refine. I did not discover the mathematics I use. I am protected by freedoms and laws I did not conceive of or legislate, and do not enforce or adjudicate.

I am moved by music I did not create myself. When I needed medical attention, I was helpless to help myself survive. I did not invent the transistor, the microprocessor, object oriented programming, or most of the technology I work with.I love and admire my species, living and dead, and am totally dependent on them for my life and well being.

Gmail Warning: That Urgent Security Notification from Google May Be a Trap

Eugene Ling , a former sales employee at Scale AI, has issued a public apology to his current team and employer, Mercor , after a report emerged that his ex-company is suing them. The lawsuit, filed two months after Scale AI secured a massive $14.3 billion investment from Mark Zuckerberg's Meta, accuses Ling of stealing confidential documents containing customer strategies and other proprietary information.“Just heard I’m getting sued by Scale. Last month, I left Scale to work at Mercor. I know this was frustrating for my old team, and I feel bad about that,” Ling said in a post.Ling also denies any “nefarious intent.” He stated that after leaving Scale, he asked his former employer if he could delete files from his personal drive, but was instructed not to.“When Scale reached out about some files I had in my personal drive, I asked if I could just delete them. But Scale asked that I not do anything with them, so I’m still waiting for guidance on how to resolve this. I’ve never used any of them in this role. It sounds like Scale wants to sue me and that’s up to them,” he said.“I’m really sorry to my new team at Mercor for having to deal with this,” he added.Ling’s post that came after a report by TechCrunch said that Scale AI’s lawsuit alleges that Ling ""stole more than 100 confidential documents concerning Scale’s customer strategies and other proprietary information"" and attempted to poach one of Scale’s largest clients for Mercor.Surya Midha, co-founder of Mercor, told the publication that Ling may have had possession of the documents but denied that his company had used any of the data.“We have no interest in any of Scale’s trade secrets and in fact are intentionally running our business in a different way,” Midha said. He also revealed that Mercor had reached out to Scale AI days before the lawsuit was filed, offering to have Ling destroy the files.Scale AI's lawsuit claims that the stolen documents contained data that would have allowed Mercor to serve several of its most important clients, including a major customer, referred to in the suit as ""Customer A."" Scale alleges that winning this client away would be “worth millions of dollars to Mercor.”The legal action comes just weeks after Meta's significant investment in Scale AI.

Targets and milestones

Raising Tesla’s market capitalization from roughly $1.1 trillion to at least $8.5 trillion.

Delivering one million autonomous “robotaxis” into commercial operation.

Deploying one million humanoid robots.

Increasing Tesla’s annual profits from $17 billion to $400 billion.

Achieving 20 million vehicle deliveries per year.

Approval & legal considerations







Elon Musk could potentially become the world’s first trillionaire under a newly proposed Tesla pay plan, which ties his compensation entirely to ambitious long-term performance milestones. The package, if fully realized, could be worth up to $1 trillion over the next decade, contingent on Tesla achieving unprecedented targets in market capitalization, vehicle deliveries, and robotics deployment. The plan relies exclusively on Tesla stock and requires Musk to remain at the company for up to 10 years to receive the full payout. Analysts describe it as the largest executive compensation in history, combining immense reward with extraordinary risk.The proposed compensation package could award Musk nearly 12% of Tesla’s total stock, approximately 423.7 million additional shares, if he meets the set targets. All compensation would be delivered in Tesla shares, with partial vesting requiring 7.5 years of continued leadership and full vesting requiring a full 10-year commitment. The ambitious nature of the plan underscores Tesla’s confidence in Musk’s leadership and its vision for exponential growth.Tesla has outlined unprecedented targets for Musk to achieve, including:These goals are widely regarded as extraordinary and challenging, pushing the boundaries of current automotive, AI, and robotics technologies.The Tesla pay plan must be approved by shareholders in a vote scheduled for November 6, 2025. Experts note that the proposal mirrors Musk’s 2018 pay plan, which faced legal hurdles, but Tesla’s relocation to Texas may help it withstand scrutiny this time. If approved, the plan could roughly double Musk’s existing Tesla stake to nearly 29%, consolidating his influence over the company’s strategic direction.Financial experts emphasizes both the extraordinary opportunity and the extreme difficulty of Musk achieving trillionaire status under this plan. Observers praise the plan as a strategic tool to secure Musk’s long-term focus at Tesla while also expressing concern over massive shareholder dilution and the feasibility of reaching such ambitious targets. If successful, the package would not only make Musk the first trillionaire in history but also fundamentally reshape executive compensation expectations in global business. This proposal could redefine not just Musk’s legacy but the future of corporate leadership itself.It highlights a new era where technology visionaries are rewarded on a scale once unimaginable.","Elon musk could potentially become the world’s first trillionaire under a newly proposed tesla pay plan.

Here’s a close look at revised tax rates across different categoriesFor the smartphone category, the government has decided to keep the default tax slab. Currently, a GST of 18% is charged on mobile phones which will continue to remain the same. This means that there will be no reduction in the price of smartphones.Similarly, GST on laptops remain unchanged at 18%.The government has also slashed GST rates on TVs which has now been moved to 18% tax slab from the current 28%. As per the official press release, following items have been moved from 285 to 18% slab:Under the latest GST reforms, the government has reduced GST from 28% to 18% on air-conditioning machines and dishwashing machines. According to reports, air conditioners may become cheaper by around Rs 1,500 to Rs 2,500, depending on the model.","The goods and services tax (gst) council has approved a two-tier rate structure of 5% and 18%.

Stock market recommendations:Swiggy is benefitting from easing competition in quick commerce (QC), with slower dark store expansion. With discounting intensity easing and sharper cost discipline, unit economics are improving, supporting a faster path to Instamart profitability. Food delivery (FD) growth, previously impacted by weak sentiment, is set to accelerate.GST-led boost to disposable income & rising discretionary spending should drive higher order volumes and platform engagement. We raise FD growth to 21–23% for FY26–27 and forecast 23% GMV CAGR over FY26–28. With stronger QC margins and improved profitability, we upgrade Swiggy to BUY with a revised TP of INR560.Phoenix Mills has expanded aggressively with new malls across Lucknow, Indore, Ahmedabad, Pune, & Bengaluru, along with acquisitions like ISMDPL (Island Star Mall Developers). These initiatives will double its portfolio by FY30, strengthening retail dominance. The company continues to diversify and expand its office portfolio within its existing mall properties across key locations.Management expects Phoenix Mills office portfolio to grow nearly fourfold to 7.1msf by FY27, driving a rental income CAGR of 71% over FY25–27.Looking ahead, new malls under construction and large-scale redevelopments are expected to drive strong consumption growth beyond FY27. We estimate revenue/EBITDA/PAT CAGR of 17%/27%/50% over FY25–27. We upgrade to BUY with a revised TP of INR 2,044.","According to motilal oswal financial services ltd, the top stock picks for the week (starting september 8, 2025) are swiggy, and phoenix mills.

Work-life balance through passion

Google's Great Escape: How ChatGPT Saved the Tech Giant

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has an unusual Sunday ritual that played a key role in shaping the success of AI voice technology firm SoundHound, its founder Keyvan Mohajer has revealed. In an interview with Fortune, Mohajer said that nearly a decade ago, Huang began sending Mohajer research papers with notes on Sunday mornings, expecting detailed feedback. The routine, Mohajer said, not only pushed him to sharpen his ideas but also influenced SoundHound’s growth into a $5.4 billion company.“It’s been one of the good things in my life to cross paths with Jensen and Nvidia,” Mohajer told Fortune. “He had a passion for what’s the next big thing, and he became very interested in our field.”Keyvan Mohajer, who first launched SoundHound in 2004 from his Stanford dorm room, met Jensen Huang about 10 years ago. What began as a chance encounter turned into a long-term relationship that combined mentorship, tough assignments, and inspiration.On several weekends, Huang would personally share technical research and ask for responses. “I had to read it and give my feedback,” Mohajer recalled.The commitment impressed Huang, who later backed SoundHound both personally and through Nvidia. By 2022, SoundHound had gone public, and Nvidia purchased around 1.73 million shares in the company the following year.“He’s an amazing person, engineer and leader,” Mohajer said. “Our relationship with him has been great.”Mohajer said his passion for building SoundHound blurred the lines between personal life and work. “Work-life balance is not a problem because I really enjoy it,” he explained. “If you work to live, then work-life balance is a big question… but in my case, I really enjoy my work.”The SoundHound chief described waking up before 5 a.m. to get what he called his “golden hours” of productivity. Even while doing household chores or exercising, he said, ideas for work often flowed naturally.“I do spend a lot of hours working. And even sometimes I go wash dishes and I’m still thinking about my work,” Mohajer said. “That can be therapeutic, and it can give you really good ideas.”","Soundhound founder keyvan mohajer met nvidia ceo jensen huang about 10 years ago.

"Undersea cables cut in Red Sea, disrupting internet access in West Asia; NetBlocks says India hit too",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/undersea-cables-cut-in-red-sea-disrupting-internet-access-in-west-asia-netblocks-says-india-hit-too/articleshow/123752105.cms,"



DUBAI: Undersea cable cuts in the Red Sea disrupted internet access in parts of Asia and West Asia, experts said on Sunday, though it wasn't immediately clear what caused the incident.There has been concern about the cables being targeted in a Red Sea campaign by Yemen's Houthi rebels, which the rebels describe as an effort to pressure Israel to end its war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip. But the Houthis have denied attacking the lines in the past.Undersea cables are one of the backbones of the internet, along with satellite connections and land-based cables. Typically, internet service providers have multiple access points and reroute traffic if one fails, though it can slow down access for users.Microsoft announced via a status website that West Asia ""may experience increased latency due to undersea fiber cuts in the Red Sea."" The Redmond, Washington-based firm did not immediately elaborate, though it said that internet traffic not moving through West Asia ""is not impacted.""NetBlocks, which monitors internet access, said ""a series of subsea cable outages in the Red Sea has degraded internet connectivity in multiple countries,"" which it said included India and Pakistan.It blamed ""failures affecting the SMW4 and IMEWE cable systems near Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.""The South East Asia-Middle East-Western Europe 4 cable is run by Tata Communications. The India-Middle East-Western Europe cable is run by another consortium overseen by Alcatel Submarine Networks. Neither firm responded to requests for comment. Pakistan Telecommunications Co. Ltd., a telecommunication giant in that country, noted that the cuts had taken place in a statement on Saturday.Saudi Arabia did not acknowledge the disruption and authorities there did not respond to a request for comment. In Kuwait, authorities also said the FALCON GCX cable running through the Red Sea had been cut, causing disruptions in the small, oil-rich nation. GCX did not respond to a request for comment.In the UAE, internet users on the country's state-owned Du and Etisalat networks complained of slower internet speeds. The govt did not acknowledge the disruption. Subsea cables can be cut by anchors dropped from ships, but can also be targeted in attacks. It can take weeks for repairs to be made as a ship and crew must locate themselves over the damaged cable. ap","Undersea cable cuts in the red sea disrupted internet access in parts of asia and west asia.

Youth seethe at overnight social media ban in Nepal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/youth-seethe-at-overnight-social-media-ban-in-nepal/articleshow/123743038.cms,"



With access to 26 major platforms cut off overnight, thousands of young Nepalis across the country have called for a protest Monday against what they said was a “digitally repressive” move by the government in Kathmandu. Demonstrations are expected to begin at 9am, with organisers calling the blackout a “direct assault on speech, work and connectivity”.Many users, particularly in urban areas, scrambled for VPNs — virtual private networks that became lifelines to a world that had abruptly become inaccessible. By midday, Google Trends showed searches for “VPN for Nepal” had surged by more than 400% overnight. Proxy browsers, DNS tweaks and foreign eSIMs also became part of the workaround toolkit. Nepal Police’s cyberbureau issued warnings about using unverified VPNs, flagging the risks of malware, fraud, and phishing.Still, these tools remained out of reach for many — particularly older users, rural students and small businesses.Ayoung protest organiser, speaking on TikTok (the only popular platform that is still accessible), urged, “Gen Z is waking up — protests must bring our voice to the streets if social media silences us.”Organising committees across Kathmandu and Pokhara are now coordinating location details offline.The sweeping ban was enforced in the hours before dawn on Friday. One by one, familiar platforms flickered to darkness — not through technical failure, but by force of a govt order acting on a Supreme Court directive. Facebook stopped loading. WhatsApp messages hung on single ticks. YouTube videos would not play.The ban targeted companies that had failed to register with local authorities. “Unregistered social media platforms will be deactivated today (Friday) onwards,” said Gajendra Kumar Thakur, spokesperson, ministry of communication and information technology.Communications minister Prithvi Subba Gurung said platforms were given multiple opportunities to comply, and once they failed to do so, action followed.The blackout fractured routines across education, tourism, recruitment and commerce. Messaging failed. Online meetings stopped. Freelancers lost access to clients. Small businesses in Kathmandu were among the first to feel the pinch.Dipa Gurung, 28, who runs a jewellery business from home, said nearly all her trade occurred through Facebook and Instagram. “I never needed a shop. My livelihood lived in chats and comments. Now, I can’t even reply to regular customers,” she said.In Pokhara, guesthouse manager Rita Rai said most of her guest communication happened on WhatsApp. “A couple from Mumbai couldn’t find our place. They wandered for over an hour before someone helped them.”For students, especially in technical fields, platforms like YouTube and Reddit had long filled learning gaps left by outdated syllabi. Mina Shrestha, 21, a computer science student, said, “We used GitHub forums, subreddits, tutorials. Now even that is gone. We’re stuck with textbooks from another decade.”Recruitment firms sending workers to the Gulf and Southeast Asia were also hit. “With LinkedIn and Zoom gone, we’ve gone back to emails and international calls.,” said Manoj Raut, 52, who runs a manpower agency.The opposition called the blackout a political tool. “First they jail our president (Rabi Lamichhane). Then they block the platforms people use to talk about it. This is tyranny,” said Pratibha Rawal, 42, joint spokesperson for Rastriya Swatantra Party.","Thousands of young nepalis across the country have called for a protest monday against what they said was a ‘digitally repressive’ move by the government in kathmandu.

'Scarce resource'





PARIS: The amount of carbon dioxide that can be stored underground is vastly overestimated, new research said Wednesday, challenging assumptions about the ""limitless"" potential this approach holds to reducing global warming Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is complex and costly, and critics say it cannot meet the urgent need to slash planet-heating emissions and meet the world's climate targets.One approach works by avoiding emissions at a polluting source -- such as a factory smokestack. Another, known as direct air capture, pulls CO2 from the atmosphere.But both require the CO2 captured to be injected into rock and locked away underground for centuries or millennia in deep geologic formations.At present, carbon capture plays a vanishingly small part in addressing the climate crisis. But scientists and policymakers consider it a necessary tool to help bring future warming down to safer levels.However, in a new paper published in the prestigious journal Nature, a team of international scientists has sharply revised down the global capacity for safely and practically storing carbon underground.They estimated a global storage limit of around 1,460 billion tonnes of CO2 -- nearly 10 times below scientific and industry assumptions.This ""reality check"" should better inform decision-makers considering carbon capture in their long-term climate policies, the study's senior author, Joeri Rogelj, told AFP.""This is a study that helps us understand -- and actually really corrects -- the working assumption of how much carbon, or CCS capacity, would be available if one takes a practical and a prudent approach,"" said Rogelj, an expert in carbon capture from Imperial College London.To reach this revised figure, the team -- led by the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis -- took existing assumptions about carbon storage and ruled out locations deemed risky or economically unviable.This included, for example, injecting CO2 below major civilian centres, into zones of known seismic activity, or many hundreds of metres beneath the oceans.The findings underscored that carbon storage should be treated as ""a scarce resource that needs to be deployed strategically to maximise climate benefits rather than... a limitless commodity"", the study said.This storage limit could be breached by 2200, the authors said, noting they could not account for possible advances in carbon capture, or other technologies, in future.Fully exhausting this capacity could lower global temperatures by 0.7C -- but that should be reserved for future generations who may need it most, the authors said.The IPCC, the UN's expert scientific panel on climate change, says carbon capture is one option for reducing emissions, including in heavy polluting sectors like cement and steel.But it remains infinitesimal: Rogelj said the amount of carbon captured every year at present amounted to approximately one-thousandth of global annual CO2 emissions.","Carbon capture and storage (ccs) is complex and costly.

Background: Display ads and competition concerns

Canada and UK also probe Google Ads





European Union regulators on Friday fined Google 2.95 billion euros ($3.5 billion) for breaching competition rules by favoring its own digital advertising services. The penalty marks the fourth antitrust fine the tech giant has faced in the EU.The European Commission, the bloc’s executive branch and top antitrust enforcer, also ordered Google to end its “self-preferencing practices” and take steps to prevent “conflicts of interest” along the advertising technology supply chain.Google said the EU decision was “wrong” and announced plans to appeal. “It imposes an unjustified fine and requires changes that will hurt thousands of European businesses by making it harder for them to make money,” Lee-Anne Mulholland, the company’s global head of regulatory affairs, said in a statement.Mulholland added, ""There’s nothing anticompetitive in providing services for ad buyers and sellers, and there are more alternatives to our services than ever before.”The European Commission began its investigation in June 2021 and found that Google “abused” its dominant positions in the ad-technology ecosystem.Regulators said the company favored its own online display advertising services at the expense of rival publishers, advertisers, and advertising technology services.Online display ads include banners and text that appear on websites and are personalized based on a user’s browsing history.The decision comes more than two years after the commission first announced antitrust charges. While the EU had previously threatened a forced breakup of Google, it has held off on that action for now.“The Commission has already signaled its preliminary view that only the divestment by Google of part of its services would address the situation of inherent conflicts of interest, but it first wishes to hear and assess Google’s proposal,” the commission said. Google has 60 days to respond, after which regulators could propose an “appropriate remedy.”Google is also facing antitrust scrutiny in the US, where prosecutors recently sought to force the company to sell its Chrome browser after a judge found it held an illegal monopoly in online search. The US justice department has asked for a sale of Google’s AdX and DFP ad platforms, tools central to both the EU and US cases.Authorities in Canada and Britain are likewise investigating the company’s digital advertising business.",Google hit with $3.5 billion eu fine for favoring its own digital advertising services.

“Dear valued customers, you may experience slowness in data services due to an interruption in the international submarine cables. Our technical teams are currently working to address the issue. We will keep you updated with the latest developments as they occur.”

“A series of subsea cable outages in the Red Sea has degraded internet connectivity in multiple countries… the incident is attributed to failures affecting the SMW4 and IMEWE cable systems near Jeddah.”

Causes, risks, and timeline for recovery





A major undersea cable disruption in the Red Sea has triggered widespread internet slowdowns across the UAE and several parts of the Middle East since Saturday, September 6, 2025. UAE telecom providers du and Etisalat (e&) confirmed the issue, which has also impacted Microsoft’s Azure cloud platform, leading to latency in network services. While providers are working on alternate routing and mitigation, full restoration could take time.On Saturday, September 6, a series of cable outages in the Red Sea severely disrupted internet infrastructure relied upon by multiple Middle Eastern countries, including the UAE. The incident, which began at 5:45 UTC (9:45am UAE time), has been confirmed by Microsoft and regional telecom providers as a result of undersea fibre cuts.Microsoft, which operates Azure, the world’s second-largest cloud computing platform after Amazon Web Services—reported increased latency in traffic routes traversing the Middle East. Although the company rerouted network traffic via alternate paths to avoid a full outage, users have still experienced a noticeable slowdown.Microsoft said in a statement on its website.Microsoft committed to providing daily updates, or sooner if conditions change, and clarified that traffic not routed through the Middle East remains unaffected.Telecom operators e& (Etisalat) and du, the two main service providers in the UAE, acknowledged the impact of the Red Sea cable cuts on their services.Etisalat, in a public statement issued via social media on Sunday, said:du released a similar message, saying:“Dear Valued Customers, You may experience some slowness in our data services due to an International submarine cable cut. Our technical teams are working with international providers to resolve the issue. We will keep you updated with the latest developments.”Both operators assured customers that restoration efforts are underway, although specific timelines were not provided.Between 6pm on Saturday, September 6 and 3am on Sunday, September 7, users across both networks reported major slowdowns or complete unavailability of internet services, according to data from Downdetector.The effect of the outage extended well beyond the UAE, with slowdowns also reported in countries such as India and across the wider Middle East.According to NetBlocks, a global internet observatory tracking cyber infrastructure:The SMW4 (SEA-ME-WE 4) and IMEWE cables are among the major subsea systems that handle vast amounts of internet traffic between Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. Their disruption left a significant portion of regional traffic needing rerouting.NetBlocks also noted visible slowdowns across both du and Etisalat networks on Saturday evening, with intermittent access and poor speeds experienced by users.While Microsoft Azure managed to avoid complete disruption by activating alternate routes, the rerouting has still led to noticeable lag and service degradation in data-intensive applications and cloud-based platforms.While the exact cause of the cable damage remains unclear, historical data shows that around 70% of undersea cable incidents are caused by ship anchors, accidental rather than deliberate. Nonetheless, there have been ongoing fears about the vulnerability of cables in the Red Sea, particularly with the Houthi conflict in Yemen. Although the group has denied targeting cables, the region remains geopolitically sensitive.Subsea cable repairs are logistically complex and can take several weeks, involving the deployment of specialised ships and crews to locate and mend the damage.As of Sunday morning, September 7, some services in the UAE showed signs of improvement, although user reports on DownDetector.ae indicated continued instability. Neither the UAE government nor regulators have issued formal statements on the incident as of now.","Users across the uae reported internet slowdowns and outages between 6pm on september 6 and 3am on september 7, data shows.
