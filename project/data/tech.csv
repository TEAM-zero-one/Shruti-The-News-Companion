First is ensuring that they get calibrated blood glucose monitoring data. Second is capturing that data on orbit from crew members. The final step is bringing that data to the ground to enable medical professionals to be able to assess it.Mitchell said the diverse & multinational crew would bring unique perspectives on this flight, with ""Shux"" (Shukla's call sign for the mission) being tasked with research focused on life science. ""One is to investigate the effects of microgravity on micrology, which is important as it could have potential future applications on uses like food, fuel, and life support systems. The second experiment he's working to accomplish is to investigate the viability of six different crop seeds for future spaceflight applications.""TOI visited the mission control room and facilities where Axiom is building its space station, but couldn't speak to Shukla or Group Captain Prashanth Nair, the second Indian astronaut training with Axiom as his backup, because of Isro's protocol.","Axiom-4 (ax4) mission will take them to the international space station (iss) later this year.

NEW DELHI: A parliamentary panel has nudged the government to spell out a timeline to introduce in Parliament the Broadcasting Services (Regulation) Bill that was shelved last year after a furore over certain provisions that sought to regulate individual content creators. The suggestion from the Standing Committee on Communications and Information Technology, chaired by BJP member Nishikant Dubey, comes at a time the government plans to celebrate content creators at the World Audio Visual and Entertainment Summit (WAVES) in Mumbai from May 1-4.The committee, in its sixth report tabled in the Lok Sabha earlier this week, has asked the Union Ministry of Information and Broadcasting ""to set a deadline for completing the entire process (of stakeholder consultation) and introduce the 'Broadcasting Services (Regulation) Bill' in Parliament at the earliest"".The suggestion also comes at a time the Supreme Court has asked the government ""to do something"" about OTT regulation while hearing the case involving YouTuber Ranveer Allahbadia for his comments on the comedy show ""India's Got Latent"".The ministry had informed the committee on January 17 that, after completing consultations with stakeholders -- extended until October 15, 2024, -- a new draft of the Bill would be prepared and sent for inter-ministerial consultation.""Following this, the draft Bill will be submitted for the Cabinet's consideration. This process is expected to take some time. The committee will be duly informed about the progress of this process,"" the ministry had told the panel.The committee, in its recommendations, said more than three months had passed since the additional time was given for receiving comments and suggestions from the general public and stakeholders.It stressed on the need for a comprehensive law and asked the government to apprise it of the progress made with respect to the Bill.""The committee call upon the ministry to set a deadline for completing the entire process and introduce the 'Broadcasting Services (Regulation) Bill' in Parliament at the earliest,"" according to the report.The draft Broadcast Bill, 2023, was placed in the public domain on November 10, 2023, inviting views, comments and suggestions from the general public and stakeholders until December 9, 2023. The deadline was later extended to January 15, 2024.The second draft was shared selectively in July 2024. It sought to impose obligations of OTT platforms on all news content creators, including those not associated with legacy media or registered digital media.The government withdrew the second draft in August last year after backlash from stakeholders and announced that a fresh draft would be published after detailed consultations.","The broadcasting services (regulation) bill was shelved last year after a furore.

Amid the ongoing debate over Tamil Nadu’s language policy, an old video of Google CEO Sundar Pichai has resurfaced online, adding fuel to the controversy. The video, which has now gone viral, features Pichai mentioning that he learned Hindi in school. A tweet accompanying the clip states: “Sundar Pichai, who comes from Chennai, Tamil Nadu, says—‘I learnt Hindi in school’. Sundar Pichai was born in 1972 and learnt Hindi during Congress rule. Clearly, Hindi was the third language in Tamil Nadu.”The resurfaced video comes at a time when DMK MP Dayanidhi Maran is facing backlash for claiming that Pichai studied under Tamil Nadu’s two-language policy and credited the system for his success.Sundar Pichai was born into a Tamil Brahmin family. His mother, Lakshmi, worked as a stenographer, while his father, Regunatha Pichai, was an electrical engineer at British conglomerate GEC. He pursued metallurgical engineering at IIT Kharagpur, where he excelled academically, earning a silver medal and securing a scholarship to study at Stanford University.Moving to the United States, Pichai completed his MS in engineering and materials science at Stanford.

Owls & Us: Seeing in the dark,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/owls-us-seeing-in-the-dark/articleshow/119028718.cms,"Owls have superpowers. They hunt like wolves of the sky. Their ears are Ferraris of sound sensitivity. Their brain does sophisticated math to pinpoint prey. They’re near-silent flyers. Their habitat and habits also make them super hard to study.What An Owl Knows: The New Science of the World’s Most Enigmatic Birds by Jennifer Ackerman takes us along the ride with naturalists, biologists, ornithologists and others using sophisticated new technologies to understand these elusive creatures. Plus with folklorists who study humanity’s biocultural memory of owls.Like all birds, they evolved out of small dinosaurs. After the great extinction 66mn years ago, owls grew into their night niche. Some 260 species exist today, spread from deserts to Arctic tundra, from pine cone sized elf owls and snowy owls like Harry Potter’s Hedwig to the naturally clowning, burrowing owls documented by James Bond, the real Bond.In India, owls are loved as Lakshmi’s ride. Some parts of India also know them as ‘corpse bird’, drawn to cemeteries because of the big trees and lack of human disturbance there. Humans are omen-minded and owls are powerful symbols. If they herald good fortune in some cultures, they’re harbingers of doom in others. Still others view them as messengers from other worlds or times.To the owls, human faces look owllike, just as their faces look humanlike to us, the book says. Yet, when an average person keeps a pet owl, viewing it through our own lens or as a mirror of ourselves, the owl suffers. As the great naturalist Henry Beston said about wild animals, they are not brethren, they are not underlings, they are other nations, caught with ourselves in the net of life and time.During mating season, the male northern saw-whet owl advertises himself through the night at 112 toots a minute, ratcheting it up to 260 when a female comes into its territory. Some owls mate for life. Other species practise divorce. So some scientists get to observe intense soap opera: Betty left Fred to live with Barney, and then not much later, Fred found himself a Wilma.Northern pygmy owls do ‘asynchronous hatching’ – to optimise the chances of some chicks surviving even if prey become scarce. Raising owl children is so energy-demanding that adults can lose a third of their body weight during the nesting season.They adopt too! Bringing up orphans and other offspring not their own. Scientists say a lot of this parental behaviour may not go beyond being genetically programmed. They have also observed siblicide, as stronger chicks kill weaker ones in times of food scarcity.Do owl voices have signatures of individual identity? Yes, to varying degrees this is the case for all owl species . Behavioural ecologists find that where the owl population is denser, calls are more distinguished and distinguishable. As in the main square in Kikinda, near the Romanian border. In the trees here, hundreds of long-eared owls roost together from Nov to March. Look up and so many pairs of black-orange eyes look down. A true Parliament!Climate change is taking a toll on nesting sites, the clock ticking on owl extinctions. But some are fighting back, the book underlines. Species like barred owls, screech owls and burrowing owls are successfully colonising urban areas. Look around, they’re there in your city too.","What an owl knows: the new science of the world’s most enigmatic birds by jennifer ackerman takes us along the ride.

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced on Thursday that NHS England will be abolished, bringing the National Health Service (NHS) back under direct government control.“I’m bringing management of the NHS back into democratic control, by abolishing the arms-length body NHS England,” Starmer said.In a speech, he explained: ""We're going to cut bureaucracy across the state. Focus government on the priorities of working people, shift money to the front line.""He further said, ""Amongst the reasons we're abolishing it is because of the duplication. So if you can believe it, we've got a communications team in NHS England, we've got a communications team in the health department of government. We've got a strategy team in NHS England, a strategy team in the government department. We're duplicating things that could be done once.

With Love, Meghan

The Duchess of Sussex , in the second episode of her new Netflix cookery show, shares how her passion for jam-making stems from childhood memories of her grandmother making apple butter. However, her estranged father, 80-year-old Thomas Markle Sr , has criticised the series, claiming Meghan has ""never been authentic"" and that ""she's faking it for the cameras.""He said that whilst his mother Doris, who passed away in 2011, deeply cared for Meghan, she would be distressed by her granddaughter's recent statements. ""I haven't seen the show but I've seen a ton of clips and I've read many stories. I might sit down and watch it one day but I'm not sure,"" Meghan’s father, Thomas Markle Sr told The Daily Mail on Sunday.During the show, viewers noticed an interaction between Meghan and Mindy Kaling , where Meghan interrupts her friend for using ' Meghan Markle ', stating: ""It's so funny you keep saying 'Meghan Markle', you know I'm 'Sussex' now.""Thomas responded: ""My mum loved Meghan very much but she would be so disappointed to hear that Meghan no longer wants to use the name ""Markle."" He further remarked sarcastically: ""Now I have to say, I am Meghan Sussex's dad.""Thomas, a seasoned Hollywood professional who has worked on shows like Married… with Children and General Hospital, shared insights from his industry experience, stating that: ""Cooking shows are horrendously boring unless the presenter has a passion for it.""""You have to be authentic to hold people’s attention. When you are stuffing the turkey’s ass it has to look like you’re having fun doing it. Unfortunately Meghan has never been authentic. She has to think about everything. She's not spontaneous. Everything she says is pre-planned and rehearsed. It makes me laugh because I know all her looks and expressions,"" the retired TV lighting director, said.He continued: ""I know when she's faking it for the cameras.

It’s sad because she’s trying so hard to stay in the limelight,"" he added.In the Netflix series, Meghan portrayed herself as a ""latchkey kid"" and discussed her supposedly modest upbringing, claiming regular consumption of fast food and TV dinners stating that: ""I grew up with a lot of fast food and also a lot of TV tray dinners. It feels like such a different time but that was so normal with the microwavable kids meals.'Thomas countered this narrative, explaining, ""We occasionally ate TV dinners, which family doesn’t?’ But I was working two jobs so money was never an issue. We would eat out at least three times a week and order in the rest of the time.""Contrary to claims of a fast-food upbringing, Meghan regularly visited Musso & Frank, an upscale Hollywood establishment operating since 1919, which was her preferred dining spot.Thomas elaborated: ""Like any single father who did a long day's work, I'd occasionally put a TV dinner in the microwave. But most of the time we'd go out. After school I would either pick her up myself and we'd go out to eat or I'd send a car to bring her to the set. She grew up on the sets I worked on. She was never a latchkey kid.""He noted that whilst his former spouse excelled at cooking, Meghan showed limited interest in culinary pursuits during her childhood. He considers her current show disconnected from everyday reality.""Meghan should make affordable food and show people how to stretch their food budget,"" he suggested further adding that, ""The women who watch Meghan's show are not all rich and privileged. I think people would love it if she focused on more economical dishes.""These statements follow recent criticism from Thomas Markle Jr, who disputed Meghan's childhood accounts in her Netflix programme.""That's just another one of the malarkey stories she sold to the royal family for sympathy,"" Thomas Jr. told TalkTV, having not communicated with the duchess for over ten years.""We weren't poor. She didn't have to rub two nickels together at Sizzler's salad bar. The entire world knows how she treated her family, especially her father, who gave her everything. That’s why nobody’s buying it,"" he added.Last week, it was revealed that the second season ofhas already been filmed and is set to premiere on Netflix this summer. The series is part of the Sussexes' five-year, $100 million deal with the streaming giant, which is set to expire in October. However, many in Hollywood speculate that Netflix may opt not to renew the agreement.","Thomas markle sr, 80, has criticised the series, claiming meghan has ""never been authentic"" he said that whilst his mother doris, who passed away in 2011, deeply cared for meghan, she would be distressed by her granddaughter's recent statements.

Albania TikTok ban to begin Thursday,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/albania-tiktok-ban-to-begin-thursday/articleshow/118976560.cms,"Where else is TikTok banned?

TikTok will be blocked in Albania for one year, starting Thursday. The Chinese-owned social media app has roughly 1.5 million users in the Balkan nation.According to local media, the Albanian Authority for Electronic and Postal Communications has ordered all internet service providers to block access to the app's servers and provide written proof.The ban was first announced in December by Prime Minister Edi Rama. The decision came after an escalation between teenagers on the platform resulted in a brawl that left a 14-year-old dead and another seriously injured.The killing triggered discussions on the impact of social media on Albania's youth, with Rama himself calling the app a ""neighborhood thug.""But opposition parties have argued against the ban, saying that they rely on the app for campaigning. The next parliamentary elections will be held in May, bringing the timing of the ban into question.Albania will be the first European nation to block the app entirely. But other countries may soon follow suit.Romanian authorities have called for the app to be suspended amid the ongoing chaos of their recently voided election. Experts credit the app for assisting a far-right candidate's shock win in last year's vote, before the result was annulled by a court.Other countries have already taken further steps.In 2020, India banned TikTok citing national security concerns.Last year, Australia banned access to all social media, including TikTok, for children under 16 years old.France, meanwhile, temporarily banned the app in New Caledonia, one of its remaining overseas colonies.",Chinese-owned app has roughly 1.5 million users in albania.

Could Europe benefit from Trump's 'assault on science'?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/could-europe-benefit-from-trumps-assault-on-science/articleshow/118976513.cms,"What is Trump's 'assault on science'?

Bad for the US, good for Europe?

Will displaced US scientists find a home in Europe?

European funders aim to attract top research talent

Stand Up for Science protests

show global solidarity

Barely six weeks after taking office for a second term, the Trump administration's cost-cutting in science and technology may result in a positive outcome for research in Europe. The journal Nature has called the moves an ""assault on science"" in the US — but they may have worldwide ramifications.President Donald Trump and his team have laid off thousands of employees at US science agencies: These include senior positions at NASA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which is considered one of the world's most important sites for climate and weather research.The job cuts have involved work on nuclear safety, disease surveillance — including that of measles and avian flu, both currently circulating in the US — extreme-weather forecasting and climate research.Even among those scientists who have retained their jobs, some are questioning whether they still have a future at American agencies and research institutes.They say they face further funding and hiring freezes, restrictions on data transfer, and censorship around climate change, gender studies and vaccine hesitancy.""We can suddenly recruit talent that we would not have been able to attract under normal circumstances,"" said Patrick Cramer, President of the Max Planck Society in Germany.The prospect of a US science brain drain is seen as ""a great opportunity for Europe as a research location,"" said Cramer.Applications from US scientists to the group of 84 Max Planck Institutes have at least doubled and, in some cases, tripled.""But for research as a whole, it is a clear step backwards, something that worries me greatly,"" he said.""It's important to stand ready to take in outstanding researchers who have to or want to leave the US,"" said Christina Beck, head of communications at the Max Planck Society in Munich.Beck told DW that universities and research centers around Germany were ""expecting a lot more applications from the US.""Some European research institutes were looking to attract US-based researchers by making it easier for them to relocate and continue their work here.France's Aix-Marseille University (AMU) announced on March 5 that it was setting up a program dedicated to attracting scientists whose research faces possible censorship in the US.The university said it aimed to welcome researchers into ""an environment conducive to innovation, excellence and academic freedom.""Major European science innovation and funding agencies are also considering measures to attract US-based scientists.Michiel Scheffer at the European Innovation Council (EIC) wrote on social media that ""a concept"" to welcome scientists from the US would be discussed at an EIC board meeting in April.The European Commission, which funds major European research projects, including a €95 billion ($103 billion) program called Horizon Europe, is considering the creation of ""a special passport"" for scientists — an EU visa policy to attract talented researchers.The policy, which the Commission plans to present later this year, would aim to attract US-based researchers, and researchers elsewhere, who feel their work may be hindered by current trends in the US.However, it's not just European research centers looking to attract US-based researchers. On March 5, the Chinese government said it would expand its efforts to attract researchers affected by Trump's funding cuts.South Korea is also formulating a response, with the government planning to revise visa policies for foreign scientists to make it easier for them to work in the country.Some European science funders warn against exploiting the challenges US-based scientists face.""We should avoid saying 'God, they are having a bad time over there, now let's go and snatch them all back,'"" said Maria Leptin, president of the European Research Council, at the European Parliament in February.But many others feel that Trump's science policies will affect science globally and say that that is what they are fighting against. As some expressed in that article in Nature, scientific research is an inherently international, collaborative effort. And there are indications that some of the cuts to US research have already affected projects in other countries.On March 7, thousands of researchers and science supporters protested in cities across the US against the Trump administration's policies. These ""Stand Up for Science"" protests mobilized across Europe, as well, including at nearly 40 university cities in France. They were inspired by the March for Science movement, inaugurated during President Trump's first term in office between 2017-2021.","President donald trump and his team have laid off thousands of employees at us science agencies.

In February, the vegetarian thali saw a reduction in cost compared to the previous year, whilst the non-vegetarian thali showed an increase due to higher broiler prices.

The vegetarian thali saw a 1% reduction year-on-year in February, whereas the non-vegetarian thali registered an increase of approximately 6%:

The reduction in vegetarian thali cost was attributed to decreased prices of tomato and LPG cylinder

In some relief for the common man, the cost of a home-cooked vegetarian thali declined year-on-year in February, according to CRISIL’s latest monthly indicator of food plate cost, RRR (Roti Rice Rate). The cost of a non-vegetarian thali, however grew approximately 6% due to rise in broiler (chicken) prices, the report said. On a month-on-month basis the cost of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian thalis came down.The calculation of an average thali's preparation cost at home by CRISIL considers input prices across different regions of India. Monthly variations indicate the impact on everyday household expenses. The analysis tracks price movements of essential ingredients including cereals, pulses, broilers, vegetables, spices, edible oil and cooking gas.The rise in non-vegetarian thali prices was primarily due to a 15% year-on-year increase in broiler (chicken) prices. Broiler (chicken), which constitutes approximately 50% of a non-vegetarian thali's cost, saw this increase due to previous year's low baseline when prices had fallen because of oversupply.Also Read | Q3 FY25 GDP grows at 6.2%; India sees 'highest growth in 12 years' in FY24 - top 10 data points to know Additionally, higher feed expenses, resulting from a 6% year-on-year increase in maize prices, contributed to the overall cost surge.During the month, both vegetarian and nonvegetarian thali costs decreased by 5% compared to the previous month. This reduction was attributed to fresh supplies causing price drops in onion (7%), potato (17%), and tomato (25%). Additionally, broiler (chicken) prices fell by an estimated 5% month-on-month due to reduced demand following bird flu concerns in southern India.","Cost of a home-cooked vegetarian thali declined year-on-year in february.

BENGALURU: Global capability centres are increasingly recruiting talent from IT services companies, with approximately half their workforce now sourced directly from these firms. Data from HR consultancy Xpheno indicates that GCCs have modified their recruitment approach, incorporating both experienced professionals and fresh graduates.Recent statistics reveal GCCs now source 45-48% of their workforce from IT firms, up from 35% in 2022-23. They offer premium salaries ranging from 20% to 30% higher than IT firms for those working in emerging areas like cloud, data and analytics. In cybersecurity and AI, GCCs maintain a 10% to 15% higher compensation for key positions, compared to IT companies, despite the overall slowdown in the technology hiring segment. ""Talent from the tier-1 players dominates the corridor of talent movement from IT services to GCCs. The mid-tier players fared relatively better on ring fencing and retained their talent from getting into corridor absorptions by GCCs. While mid-tier players do lose talent to GCCs, their scale is lower, and the current movement is roughly a 30-70 split between the mid-tier and tier-1 talent absorbed by GCCs,"" said Kedar Pathak, GCC specialist at Xpheno.Both new and expanding GCCs are driving recruitment in India, where 75% of their technology operations are based. These centres are expanding beyond traditional hubs into emerging locations like Coimbatore and Jaipur, according to HR consultancy NLB Services. These cities have developed substantial tech talent pools due to IT services companies' presence.ANSR's cofounder Vikram Ahuja notes that GCCs are increasingly partnering with finishing schools to secure candidates with specific skill sets. He said that campus recruitment isn't their primary focus. ""Over the last two to three years, tapping finishing schools rose from a negligible 5% to about 10% now. In the next two to three years, I feel it will go up to 20%. In the longer run, this segment will contribute a great deal to the talent needs of GCCs as there is a lot of competition in the tech market with product firms, startups, and services cohorts,"" Ahuja said.Senior-level recruitment remains strong, with Xpheno reporting over 100 VPs, AVPs, and SVPs moving from IT services to GCCs within a year. This represents 10% of IT services' senior workforce, with other senior hires going to product companies and startups, primarily driven by better compensation. According to Quess Corp IT staffing CEO Kapil Joshi, GCC technology leadership positions offer 14% higher compensation than IT peers, whilst CFOs receive 12% more, and HR leaders earn 25% higher packages compared to IT firms.","Gccs source 45-48% of their workforce from it firms, up from 35% in 2022-23.
