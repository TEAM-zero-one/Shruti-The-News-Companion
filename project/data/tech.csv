CDS lashes out at defence companies: 'Show a bit of patriotism',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/cds-lashes-out-at-defence-companies-show-a-bit-of-patriotism/articleshow/125358608.cms,"Don’t Overprice Products, Deliver On Time: Gen

NEW DELHI: Flagging concerns that Indian arms companies were failing to deliver emergency procurements on time and that some of them were even inflating the extent of indigenous content in their products, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Anil Chauhan has said the armed forces expect ""a bit of nationalism and patriotism"" in industry's ""profit-driven endeavours"".""Defence reforms are not a one-way street. (Domestic) industries will have to be truthful about their indigenous capabilities to us. You cannot leave us in the lurch. When you sign a contract and don't deliver in that particular time frame, it is a capability that is being lost,"" CDS said at a USI seminar on Friday. CDS said Army had told him ""most"" of the Indian companies had ""over-promised things"" and failed to deliver in specified time-frames during 5th and 6th phases of the emergency procurements mechanism. tnnCDS said ""most"" of the Indian companies have ""over-promised things"" and failed to deliver in specified time-frames.""This is unacceptable,"" he said. The EP mechanism empowers the armed forces to fast-track contracts, each worth Rs 300 crore that have to be executed within a year, instead of following the normal long-winded procurement procedure.After EP-5 last year, which was reserved exclusively for domestic companies, the defence ministry had approved EP-6.This came following the cross-border hostilities with Pakistan during Operation Sindoor in May.It will help the Army, Indian Air Force and Navy to build as well as replenish their stockpiles of missiles and other long-range weapons, loiter and precision-guided munitions, kamikaze drones and counter-drone systems, among other weapons and ammunition, through both foreign and domestic sources.Amid allegations that many domestic companies are merely assembling systems after importing them, instead of manufacturing them, Gen Anil Chauhan said, ""A lot of industries say this (a product) is 70% indigenous, but actually, if you find out, it is not. You have to be truthful about this. Because it is related to matters of security.""The Chief of Defence Staff also criticised the overpricing of weapon systems and platforms.""You will have to be cost-competitive. Cost competitiveness is not for selling to the Indian armed forces. You have to be cost-competitive to compete in the foreign market.

Police bust international cybercrime gang siphoning bitcoins from americans through microsoft support scam,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/police-bust-international-cybercrime-gang-siphoning-bitcoins-from-americans-through-microsoft-support-scam/articleshow/125350116.cms,"-

BENGALURU: In what looks like a major syndicate of an international cybercrime network, a gang operating from the city targeted citizens in the USA and siphoned off money under the pretext of Microsoft Technical Support personnel handling the 'Federal Trade Commission'. The gang was busted. However, cops are yet to discover the number of victims and the amount lost by them.Acting on a tip-off, police teams from the special cell of the Cyber Command, along with sleuths from the Cyber Crime Police Station, Whitefield division, raided the office premises of Musk Communications located on the 6th Floor, Delta Building, Sigma Soft Tech Park, Whitefield Main Road, near Varthur Kodi. They seized computers, hard disks, laptops, mobile phones, and other electronic gadgets. Additionally, 21 staffers working in the office were arrested. They were produced before a court on Saturday evening and were taken into police custody for questioning. Equipped with a search warrant from a court, the raids were carried out on Friday and Saturday.The firm Musk Communications rented a spacious 4,500 square feet office premises from this August, police investigations revealed. “We have to question the building owner on some points.Also, the rent for this office premises runs into several lakhs for sure,” an investigating officer said.A senior police officer explained their modus operandi to STOI and said, “The miscreants deployed malicious Facebook advertisements to freeze victims’ computers, falsely claimed data compromise, and extorted money under the guise of Federal Trade Commission (FTC) violations. They ran targeted Facebook advertisement campaigns aimed at United States-based users, embedding malicious code disguised as genuine service links or security alerts,” he said, adding that “When an unsuspecting user clicked on the advertisement, the code executed and locked the system. A pop-up message then appeared, falsely claiming to be from Microsoft Global Technical Support and displaying a fake helpline number. Once victims contacted the number, the fraudsters impersonated technical support executives. They misled victims by claiming their computers were hacked, their IP addresses were compromised, and that their banking credentials and personal data were at high risk. Under the pretext of resolving the alleged hacking and 'FTC violations', the fraudsters falsely claimed that the Federal Trade Commission was involved. They coerced victims into paying for security fixes, compliance procedures, or immediate risk mitigation, collecting large sums from them,” he said.Director General of Police-Cyber Command Unit, Bengaluru, Pronab Mohanty, said they suspect miscreants of duping the victims of hundreds of crores in the form of bitcoins. According to Mohanty, they acted on a concrete tip-off about the company and its illegal activities.“The raids were carried out for two days. During the operation, 21 employees, who were actively involved in cheating foreign nationals by posing as Microsoft support technicians, were secured and arrested. Several computer systems, digital devices, mobile phones, and other electronic evidence used for committing the offence were seized. A large and detailed picture will come out in the near future as we question the suspects,” Mohanty said.","Cops are yet to discover the number of victims and the amount lost by them.

Not many people realize she's been quietly writing short stories and screenplays, and one of them is inspired by their relationship.""As per Radar Online, another source revealed that, ""Until it's complete and ready for production, she's keeping everything strictly confidential…”The source continued, ""Taylor's always guarded with her creative work, but this project has an added layer of secrecy because it's unfamiliar territory for her.She's meticulous by nature – writing songs comes instinctively to her, but screenwriting is a whole new craft.”However, neither Taylor Swift nor Travis Kelce has confirmed these speculations yet as they continue to be pretty private about their high profile lives.Coming back to Taylor Swift’s recently released trailer of her documentary, The End of an Era, it seems it has sparked chaos and panic among fans.The trailer showcases how Taylor Swift planned one of the biggest concerts in the world, how she trained for it and also how she fell in love with Travis Kelce.The two minute trailer also features Taylor Swift’s mother, Andrea Swift, as she expressed the happiness that Travis Kelce has brought into their family.While the documentary features Travis Kelce, the power couple has remained silent about their wedding plans.","Taylor swift and travis kelce have turned heads with their romance in the recently released trailer of the pop star’s documentary, the end of an era.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu on Arattai app dropping out of top 100 list: ‘I literally told our employees…’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/zoho-founder-sridhar-vembu-on-arattai-app-dropping-out-of-top-100-list-i-literally-told-our-employees/articleshow/125278324.cms,"Vembu: Zoho has long-term strategy









Zoho Corporation founder and CEO Sridhar Vembu has responded to his company's messaging app Arattai falling out of the top 100 apps list, calling it a normal part of business development and dismissing critics as wasting their time. In an interview with ANI, Vembu addressed questions about WhatsApp testing a feature that would allow users to message people on other platforms.“There's nothing going wrong. I think, first of all, the idea that something went wrong is what is wrong. It is a normal course of events. Nothing goes straight to the moon. You have to go through these ups and downs,” Vembu was quoted as saying.He emphasised that companies that survive maintain a long-term perspective.“The trick to companies that survive is they have a long-term view on this. In fact, I never thought The number one is anything big. In fact, I literally told our employees, this is a particular moment, it won't last,” he added.“That's why I simply don't pay attention. And the people who pay attention and making fun of this, they are wasting their time. That's all I'll say. We are not wasting time. I am sitting and we are sitting and focused on code.So I said, don't worry about it,” Vembu noted, pointing out that Zoho views Arattai as a five to 15-year project rather than a short-term venture.Vembu revealed that Zoho has worked on messaging technology for 10 years, making the recent ranking drop insignificant.“Our strategy in all this, the messaging is very core. And we have been working on it for 10 years. So this one month is nothing for us. We will continue this and we have a really strong app. It's getting stronger,” the cofounder was quoted as saying.The company plans frequent updates to improve Arattai. Vembu argued that credible competition is necessary to prevent monopolistic practices in the messaging app market.“If we don't have competition, you can't keep the monopolist honest. The only thing that keeps a monopolist honest is competition,” he said.While talking about end-to-end encryption of chats on Arattai, Vembu noted that the encryption feature has been implemented, however, it will take some more time for the updates to take effect.","Vembu: zoho has long-term strategy for messaging app arattai.

Google’s $40 billion investment in Texas





Google has announced a $40 billion investment in Texas through 2027, marking one of its largest US infrastructure commitments to date. The funds, the company said will go toward building new cloud and AI infrastructure, including new data center campuses in Armstrong County and Haskell County. Google CEO shared an online post, announcing the investment. “Today, we're announcing a new $40B investment in Texas through 2027 to build Cloud & AI infrastructure and support thousands of new jobs,” he wrote in the post.“This includes new data centers in Armstrong and Haskell Counties and a major investment to strengthen energy resilience and abundance. We're also providing funding to more than double the projected pipeline of new Texan electricians to power the AI era,” he added.“We've proudly called Texas home for 15 years. Thank you @GregAbbott_TX for your continued support,” Pichai continued.As part of the $40 billion investment, Google said it will continue its approach of growing infrastructure responsibly, which includes adding new clean energy resources to the Texas grid and covering the costs tied to its operations. The company also announced a new $30 million Energy Impact Fund to help scale community energy-efficiency projects across the state.Google also confirmed it has secured more than 6,200 megawatts of new energy generation and capacity through power-purchase agreements with energy developers. One of the new Haskell County data centers will be built alongside a solar and battery storage plant, reinforcing the company’s push toward cleaner, more reliable energy resources.In order to support construction of the new facilities, Google will help expand Texas’ pool of skilled electrical workers. In partnership with the electrical training ALLIANCE, the company will help train existing electricians and more than 1,700 apprentices by 2030, more than doubling the state’s expected pipeline of new electricians.Google said the investment is meant not only to bolster Texas’ workforce and infrastructure, but to help ensure the U.S. maintains “the technical backbone to lead the world in AI.”","Google has announced a $40 billion investment in texas through 2027.

""per agent""

""Dwarkesh Podcast""

“Our business, which today is an end-user tools business, will become essentially an infrastructure business in support of agents doing work.

The way to think about the per-user business is not just per user, it's per agent.”

“All the stuff we built underneath M365 still is going to be very relevant. You need some place to store it, some place to do archival, some place to do discovery, some place to manage all of these activities, even if you're an AI agent,""

“grow faster than the number of users.”

Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained

Read what Satya Nadella said about adjsuting software business pricing model





“Don't think of the tool as the end thing. What is the entire substrate underneath that tool that humans use, and that entire substrate is the bootstrap for the AI agent as well, because the AI agent needs a computer that's kind of one. So in fact, that's why I think we're going to have essentially an end-user computing infrastructure business, which I think is going to just keep growing because guess what, it's going to grow faster than the number of users.

So in fact, that's kind of one of the other questions people asked me is ‘hey, what happens to the per-user business?’ At least the early signs may be the way to think about the per user business is not just per user, it's per agent, and if you sort of say it's per user and per agent, the key is what's the stuff to provision for every agent, a computer, a set of security things around it, an identity around it and all those things are observability and so on are the management layers. And that's I think is going to get baked into that.”

What Satya Nadella said about how AI agents is being integrated in Microsoft’s tools





“Well, let's take even this little thing we built called

Excel Agent

. Excel Agent is not a UI-level wrapper in this case because we have all the IPs from the GPT family. We are taking that and putting it into the core middle tier of the office system. I need to see both, not just see the pixels; I need to be able to see. Oh. I got that formula wrong, and I need to understand that. So I'm giving it essentially a markdown to teach it the skills of what it means to be a sophisticated Excel user. That's the type of stuff that will get built by everybody. So even for the model companies, they're allowed to compete, right? So if their price stuff high, guess what if I'm a builder of a tool like this? I'll substitute you. And so as long as there's competition where there's multiple models and there's an open source check, there is enough room here to go build value on top of models.”

“Don't worry about the Excel integration. After all Excel was built as a tool for analyst. So whoever is this AI, that is an analyst.”

“I'm building an analyst as essentially an AI agent, which happens to come with an a priori knowledge of how to use all of these analytical tools,”





Microsoft's software business is planning to adjust its pricing model. Satya Nadella , the software giant’s CEO, has revealed the company is shifting from chargingtoas artificial intelligence (AI) systems increasingly perform autonomous work alongside human employees. Speaking on the, Nadella explained that Microsoft's business is transitioning from an end-user tools company to an infrastructure provider supporting AI agents that can complete tasks and make decisions independently. Nadella said:The shift reflects a broader industry transformation as companies reconsider how to charge customers, adopting agentic AI systems that run software rather than simply being powered by it. Nadella noted Microsoft's services, including the Microsoft 365 suite, which already earns $100 billion in revenue per year, would serve as the core workspace for AI agents.Nadella said. He also suggested that this new infrastructure business wouldEarlier this year, Microsoft introduced a pay-as-you-go pricing model for its AI agents. The metered system sits on top of a free Copilot chat experience for Microsoft 365 users, allowing companies to pay based on the work their AI agents perform.Other tech companies, such as Anthropic, also bill customers based on usage, charging for their Claude models per million tokens processed.Google uses a comparable pay-as-you-go approach for its Gemini API.Discussing how Microsoft is planning to adjust the pricing models of its software business, Nadella noted:At the podcast, Nadella explained:Nadella highlighted:he added.",Satya nadella said microsoft's business is transitioning from an end-user tools company to an infrastructure provider supporting ai agents.

Competing with SpaceX's dominance









Jeff Bezos’s Blue Origin achieved a historic milestone by successfully landing its massive New Glenn rocket booster on a droneship in the Atlantic Ocean, prompting congratulations from rival SpaceX CEO Elon Musk . The successful landing marks a pivotal moment in the commercial space race, making Blue Origin only the second company after SpaceX to master the complex technology of landing orbital-class rocket boosters for reuse.“Congratulations @JeffBezos and the @BlueOrigin team!"" Musk wrote on social media in a response to Blue Origin’s announcement.In a separate post, Musk replied to a post shared by Jeff Bezos who shared a video clip of the New Glenn rocket booster landing in the middle of a platform floating in the ocean.The New Glenn booster, standing over 320 feet tall and powered by seven advanced BE-4 engines, touched down on the droneship Jacklyn just minutes after launching from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station at 3:55 PM EST. The landing followed the successful deployment of NASA's twin ESCAPADE satellites on a mission to study Mars’s atmospheric loss and solar wind interactions.“We achieved full mission success today, and I am so proud of the team. Never before in history has a booster this large nailed the landing on the second try. This is just the beginning as we rapidly scale our flight cadence and continue delivering for our customers,” said Dave Limp, Blue Origin's CEO.The achievement represents a significant breakthrough in Blue Origin's efforts to compete with SpaceX, which has long dominated the reusable rocket market with its Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy vehicles. Reusability reduces launch costs by allowing expensive first-stage boosters to be recovered, refurbished, and flown multiple times rather than discarded after a single use.Blue Origin’s New Glenn is designed for up to 25 reuses, promising to bring competitive pricing and reliability to deep space and orbital missions. The company has already secured multiple years of orders from customers including NASA, Amazon's Project Kuiper, AST SpaceMobile, and several telecommunications providers.","Blue origin’s second-try success marks a pivotal moment in the commercial space race.

SEBI’s advisory in digital gold



Read SEBI’s advisory here:



SEBI has enabled investments in gold and gold related instruments through various SEBI regulated gold products. These are exchange traded commodity derivative contracts, Gold Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) offered by Mutual Funds and Electronic Gold Receipts (EGRs) tradeable on stock exchanges. Investments in these SEBI regulated gold products can be made through SEBI registered intermediaries and are governed by the regulatory framework prescribed by SEBI.

It has come to the notice of SEBI that some digital/online platforms are offering investors to invest in ""Digital Gold/E-Gold Products'. Digital Gold is being marketed as an alternative for investment in physical gold.

In this context, it is informed that such digital gold products are different from SEBI regulated gold products as they are neither notified as securities nor regulated as commodity derivatives. They operate entirely outside the purview of SEBI. Such digital gold products may entail significant risks for investors and may expose investors to counterparty and operational risks.

Investors/ participants are made aware that none of the investor protection mechaims under securities market purview shall be available for investments in such Digital Gold/ E-Gold products.





Zerodha CEO Nithin Kamath has now issued a cautionary note for the investors following SEBI’s recent advisory on digital gold. For those unaware, earlier this week SEBI issued a an advisory on digital gold calling it an unregulated and inefficient way to gain exposureto the precious metal. Now Kamath shared a post of social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) advising the users to not to go after digital gold and instead opt for the one of the safest and easiest ways — gold ETFs if they want to inset in gold. “Most people don’t realize that nobody regulates digital gold, and if something were to happen to the platforms or companies selling it, there’s not much you can do,” wrote Kamath.In a post shared on X, Kamath emphasised that digital gold is not regulated by any financial authority, which means that investors have limited recourse if the platforms selling it collapse or default. He noted that most buyers are unaware of this regulatory gap. “Most people don’t realize that nobody regulates digital gold, and if something were to happen to the platforms or companies selling it, there’s not much you can do,” Kamath wrote.Along with this, Kamath also pointed out the high upfront costs associated with digital gold purchases such as a 3% GST, plus 2–3% in spreads, which in tern means that the investors will lose another 6% immediately after buying digital gold, even before the regulatory risks kick in.Kamath also said that with Sovereign Gold Bonds going away, the only safest and easiest way to invest in gold is through gold exchange-traded funds (ETFs). “Now that Sovereign Gold Bonds (SGBs) have stopped, gold ETFs remain one of the safest and easiest ways to get exposure to gold,’ Kamath.The remarks made by Kamath align with the Securities and Exchange Board of India’s (SEBI) recent warning about the risks of investing in digital gold. SEBI cautioned that these products are not covered under its regulatory framework and urged investors to exercise due diligence.","Zerodha ceo nithin kamath has issued a cautionary note for the investors following sebi’s recent advisory on digital gold. ‘most people don’t realize that nobody regulates digital gold, and if something were to happen to the platforms or companies selling it, there's not much you can do,’ wrote kamath.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125291255,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-40120,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

How Apple positions iPhone Pocket in its product ecosystem





Retail experience and purchase process at launch









Apple and Japanese fashion house ISSEY MIYAKE have jointly introduced iPhone Pocket, a 3D-knitted textile accessory designed to be worn or carried and to hold an iPhone plus other small everyday items. The product is described as a “piece of cloth” reimagined as a flexible pocket: its ribbed, open-knit fabric expands to enclose a device and lets users glimpse the display when stretched. iPhone Pocket is available in two strap lengths and multiple colours, and Apple frames it as a special-edition accessory that complements iPhone design and personal style. The launch is positioned as both a fashion collaboration and a product engineered for universal fit and everyday utility.iPhone Pocket is a singular, 3D-knitted construction developed by ISSEY MIYAKE in close collaboration with Apple Design Studio. Crafted in Japan, the textile draws inspiration from the brand’s iconic pleats and is intended to function as an additional, wearable pocket for iPhone and other “pocketable items” such as AirPods. The knit’s ribbed open structure allows the textile to expand and subtly reveal contents when stretched, while fully enclosing items when relaxed.Apple and ISSEY MIYAKE describe the material as engineered for both look and function, combining traditional craft with modern textile R&D.iPhone Pocket is a singular, 3D-knitted construction developed by ISSEY MIYAKE in close collaboration with Apple Design Studio.

The knit’s ribbed open structure allows the textile to expand and subtly reveal contents when stretched, while fully enclosing items when relaxed. Apple and ISSEY MIYAKE describe the material as engineered for both look and function, combining traditional craft with modern textile R&D.According to Apple, the iPhone Pocket is sized and structured to fit any iPhone model as well as small everyday items. The open knit expands to accommodate slightly bulkier contents and lets users peek at the iPhone display without removing the phone fully. Apple highlights multiple ways to use the accessory: handheld, attached to a bag, or worn on the body. The product is positioned as a fashion accessory as much as a utility item, emphasising styling and personal expression alongside practical carrying.Apple’s Newsroom states the iPhone Pocket was crafted in Japan and that its development and design unfolded through collaboration between ISSEY MIYAKE’s research and development teams and Apple Design Studio. The piece references ISSEY MIYAKE’s longstanding practice of pleating and textile innovation as the inspiration for the accessory’s knit structure. Apple quotes design leads from both organisations to underline the shared approach to simplicity, craftsmanship and adaptability.Apple positions iPhone Pocket as both fashion and function: the open knit and colour palette were explicitly selected to mix and match with iPhone finishes and to let users create personal combinations. Apple images show Pocket paired with iPhone 17, iPhone 17 Pro and iPhone Air models in complementary colours. Practical use cases emphasised by Apple include carrying the iPhone and small items together, wearing the Pocket across the body for hands-free use, and tying it to other bags or accessories. Retail staff will assist customers in stores in selecting strap length and colour combinations.Apple’s announcement emphasises the crafted textile quality and the 3D-knitted construction, but does not publish a formal care guide in the Newsroom piece. Because iPhone Pocket is a textile accessory made in Japan using ISSEY MIYAKE’s knit techniques, consumers should expect typical fabric care considerations gentle handling, avoiding sharp objects, and following any care instructions included in product packaging or on Apple’s online product pages after purchase. For definitive care and warranty details, customers should consult Apple’s product page or in-store specialists at launch.Apple frames iPhone Pocket as a special-edition accessory that complements iPhone design language and expands how users carry and style their devices. The product is intended to sit alongside Apple’s existing accessory portfolio rather than replace protective cases: it emphasises wearability, textile design, and aesthetic pairing. Apple highlights the accessory’s ability to carry other small items (for example, AirPods) and to visually coordinate with iPhone finishes.Apple’s announcement lists the specific Apple Store locations where iPhone Pocket will be available at launch and notes that both online and in-store purchase options will be offered beginning November 14, 2025. Apple Specialists will help customers mix and match lengths and colours with their iPhone and demonstrate styling options. Customers outside the initial launch markets should monitor apple.com for availability updates.","Iphone pocket is a 3d-knitted textile accessory designed to be worn or carried and to hold an iphone plus other small everyday items.

CEO Nadella says market expansion matters more than market share





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella brushed off concerns about losing coding assistant market share to upstart competitors, calling the emergence of new rivals like Cursor and Claude Code a positive sign for the industry rather than an existential threat. Speaking on the Dwarkesh Podcast during a tour of Microsoft's new Fairwater 2 datacenter, Nadella responded to data showing GitHub Copilot's market share declining from nearly 100% to around 25% in just one year. ""I love this chart for so many reasons. One is we're still on the top,"" he said, noting that competitors like Cursor, Anthropic's Claude Code, and OpenAI's Codex have collectively grown the AI coding market from $500 million to $5-6 billion in annual revenue.Rather than fighting to maintain dominance in coding assistants, Microsoft is repositioning GitHub as a platform for all AI coding agents. The company announced at its GitHub Universe conference that its new Agent HQ interface will allow outside coding assistants, including OpenAI's Codex and Anthropic's Claude Code, to plug into the GitHub ecosystem.""When you say, who's it now? Claude's going to kill you, Cursor is going to kill you, it's not Borland.Thank God,"" Nadella said, referencing the defunct 1990s software company. ""That means we are in the right direction.""The strategy reflects a calculated bet that GitHub's 180 million developer user base and role as the central repository for code gives Microsoft structural advantages even as individual tools compete. Jay Parikh, who oversees GitHub as Microsoft's executive vice president of CoreAI, told The Verge the company needs an ""arms-wide-open ecosystem"" approach.Nadella emphasized that the rapid growth of the overall AI coding category matters more than Microsoft's shrinking slice of it. ""The fact that we went from nothing to this scale is the market expansion,"" he said, comparing it to the cloud computing transition that ultimately grew Microsoft's business despite lower margins than the previous server-based model.The CEO noted that GitHub continues to benefit regardless of which coding tool wins, as repositories, pull requests, and developer sign-ups have reached all-time highs. ""Guess where all the repos of all these other guys who are generating lots and lots of code go? They go to GitHub,"" Nadella said on the podcast, adding that one developer joins GitHub every second.",Github copilot's market share has declined from nearly 100% to around 25% in a year.

Amrutesh Vallabhaneni, an H-1B visa holder in the US, has brought a lawsuit against his employer, accusing the company of forced labor, labor trafficking and withholding visa documents, Breitbart News reported. Jay Palmer, Vallabhaneni's consultant who prepared the lawsuit, said it is a Squid Game for Indian workers in the US job market, as the ultimate goal is to stay in America, surviving the exploitative culture, created by Indian CEOs. These Indian-origin CEOs import their ""home-country caste discrimination politics"" to their workplaces in the US, Palmer said.According to the report, Vallabhaneni studied in India, got an F-1 student visa and a loan to attend a US college in 2015. Then he got OPT (Optional Practical Training), worked at a New Jersey company and then in 2018 moved to the company that he sued. He moved to the company as they promised him H-1B. The lawsuit said that the company violated laws and asked Vallabhaneni to pay his own salary for a period of six months. They also did not pay Vallabhaneni the prevailing wage.But after all this, Vallabhaneni was not free to leave the company as they allegedly threatened to withdraw his H-1B if he did not comply with their requests.The company also promised a green card but continued to pressure Vallabhaneni to accept their terms and conditions; otherwise he would have to leave the US.""Despite being guaranteed a wage by the DOL, AV (Amrutesh Vallabhaneni) often barely had enough money for rent and living expenses for himself and his family.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India





MUNICH: OpenAI’s chatbot ChatGPT violated German copyright laws by reproducing lyrics from songs by best-selling musician Herbert Groenemeyer and others, a court ruled on Tuesday, in a closely watched case against the firm over its use of lyrics to train its language models. The regional court found that the company trained its AI on protected content from nine German songs, including Groenemeyer’s hits “Maenner” and “Bochum”. The case was brought by German music rights society GEMA.Presiding judge Elke Schwager ordered OpenAI to pay damages for the use of copyrighted material, without disclosing a figure.OpenAI had argued that its language models did not store or copy specific training data but, rather, reflected what they had learned based on the entire training data set.Since the output would only be generated as a result of user inputs known as prompts, it was not the defendants, but the users who would be liable, OpenAI had argued. However, the court found that both the memorisation in the language models and the reproduction of the song lyrics in the chatbot’s outputs constitute infringements of copyright exploitation right.“We disagree with the ruling and are considering next steps,” a spokesperson for OpenAI said. “The decision is for a limited set of lyrics and does not impact the millions of people who use our technology every day.”REUTERS",Openai's chatbot violated german copyright laws by reproducing lyrics from songs by best-selling musician herbert groenemeyer and others.

Ultracheap and still duty-free

Millions of packages from China

Protecting consumers in the EU

EU authorities are not sitting still

EU countries are not sitting still either





When Chinese fast-fashion online retailer Shein opened its first boutique last week, there were both protests and a crowd of shoppers.The brick-and-mortar shop inside the BHV Marais department store in central Paris hit a nerve and not just because it is in the home of haute couture. It was a love-hate response to the company seen in many other areas.Shein, which is often put in the same category as the Temu online platform that allows manufacturers to sell much more than just fashion directly to consumers, has been criticized for things like counterfeits, aggressive marketing, poor working conditions, and unsafe products. Despite that, many are happy with more shopping options and the cheap prices.Though the two companies are different and have different business models, the result is often the same: a flood of cheap Chinese goods and the packaging to go along with it.Besides simply being ultracheap, another factor that played in the companies' favor is the European Union 's exemption from import duties for packages valued under €150 ($174).The US had a similar loophole for packages valued under $800 (€691), but has changed its regulations leading to a reduction in shipments.The EU is in the final stages of passing a similar rule to close its own low-value loophole, though it may not come into force until 2028.In the first half of 2025, Temu had an average of 115 million monthly active users in the EU and Shein had 145 million, according to their own numbers. For both platforms, this is around 12% more than the previous six months.One of the biggest concerns about these Chinese e-commerce platforms is sustainability. A majority of goods bought on their platforms are sent directly to consumers around the world from manufacturers in China. These individually packed goods are flown in for quick delivery and overwhelm customs authorities and often cannot be returned.Environmental groups are concerned about the clothing waste caused by cheap fast fashion, the plastic and cardboard packaging trash, plus the emissions from all those flights to move the goods around the world. And the numbers are indeed huge.In 2024, around 4.6 billion low-value items were imported into the EU, according to a report published in February by the EU executive Commission. That is twice the number in 2023 and more than triple the number in 2022.Of these 12 million packages a day, 91% are from China. Not all of these packages are from Temu or Shein, but together they have a huge share of the pie.""Europe is inundated by a tsunami of small parcels coming from China, and it's not about to stop,"" Agustin Reyna, director general of the Brussels-based European Consumer Organization (BEUC), told DW.Besides sustainability issues, consumer protection watchdogs and the European Commission have repeatedly warned of unsafe products that don't meet EU standards.New test results published on October 30 by Stiftung Warentest, an independent organization based in Berlin that specializes in product testing, reinforce what many fear.The tests, which were conducted with groups from Belgium and Denmark, showed dramatic results. Together, they looked into necklaces, USB chargers and baby toys.Of the 162 items purchased from manufacturers selling through Temu and Shein, 110 were not up to EU standards, and around a quarter were potentially dangerous. Some of the items had high levels of formaldehyde or heavy metals like cadmium. Some of the USB charges simply got too hot.The European Consumer Organisation thinks flouting safety regulations leads to unfair competition since some companies sell products that do not meet European safety standards, while local companies must follow such rules.In May, the EU Commission notified Shein about practices on its platform that infringe EU consumer law. Among the complaints are fake discounts, pressuring consumers to complete purchases, misleading information about consumers' legal rights, deceptive product labels and misleading sustainability claims.In July, the Commission preliminarily found that Temu is in breach of its obligations under the Digital Services Act by not doing enough to stop the sale of illegal products. Further investigations are ongoing and could lead to a large fine.In October, Germany's antitrust authority, the Cartel Office, initiated proceedings against Temu. They want to see if the platform is possibly influencing the pricing on its German online marketplace, including setting the final selling prices.In August, Shein was fined €1 million by Italy's competition authority for using misleading environmental claims.In July, Shein was fined €40 million by France's competition agency for misleading discounts and environmental claims. That brings total French fines for the company this year to €191 million.France has gone a step further and is working on new regulations for fast-fashion companies like Temu and Shein. If approved, it would ban their ads in France, force them to report on the environmental effects of their goods and add a levy of up to €10 for each garment bought.Big fines and more regulations may slow Chinese e-commerce giants but will not stop them.""Europe needs to get its act together and make Temu and Shein accountable,"" said Agustin Reyna. ""We need clear responsibilities and deterrent consequences when the products they sell break our rules.""To make this happen, the EU needs ambitious customs reform and market surveillance.

Fujian Vs Ford: China Unveils Its Most Advanced Carrier, Reshaping Indo-Pacific Power Balance





PARIS: China's CO2 emissions remained flat in the third quarter as power generation from solar energy surged and electric car use continued to grow, a study showed on Tuesday.Emissions from the world's biggest polluter have now been flat or falling for 18 straight months, said the analysis published by climate news specialist Carbon Brief.""After the first three quarters of the year, China's CO2 emissions in 2025 are now finely balanced between a small fall or rise, depending on what happens in the last quarter,"" said Lauri Myllyvirta, lead analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air.""A drop in the full-year total became much more likely after September, which recorded an approximately three percent drop in emissions year-on-year,"" said Myllyvirta, who is also a senior fellow at the Asia Society Policy Institute.The new analysis, which is based on official Chinese data, comes as the UN's COP30 climate conference kicked off in Brazil on Monday.""While an emission increase or decrease of one percent or less might not make a huge difference in an objective sense, it has heightened symbolic meaning,"" Myllyvirta said.""China's policymakers have left room for emissions to increase for several more years, leaving the timing of the peak open,"" he added.Emissions from the power sector, China's dominant source of CO2, remained flat in the third quarter despite strong demand for electricity, Myllyvirta said.Electricity generation from solar energy rose 46 percent while wind grew 11 percent compared to the same period last year.Emissions from transport fuel dropped by five percent, with declines also in cement and steel production.Oil demand and emissions grew elsewhere by 10 percent as the production of plastics and other chemicals surged, the analysis found.In September, China issued its first-ever absolute targets for cutting planet-warming gases.Under the new plan, China will reduce economy-wide emissions by seven to 10 percent by 2035 relative to the year of the country's peak emissions, believed to be 2025.China had previously pledged to peak its carbon output before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, without ever previously setting near-term numerical targets for total emissions reductions.",Emissions from the world's biggest polluter have now been flat or falling for 18 straight months.

Oil demand and emissions grew elsewhere by 10 percent as the production of plastics and other chemicals surged.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125253831,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-1011412,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

A private royal zoo and wildlife conservation efforts





Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the Crown Prince of Dubai, is not just a figurehead of royalty—he is a man of extraordinary wealth, influence, and interests. With an estimated personal net worth ranging from $1 billion to $2 billion, Sheikh Hamdan is one of the wealthiest and most influential royals in the world. This fortune is drawn from a variety of sources, including luxurious real estate, superyachts, private jets, and rare car collections. However, these estimates often focus only on his personal assets, and his actual wealth is likely far greater when considering his family's assets and the extensive holdings tied to the Al Maktoum family.In fact, some reports estimate that the Al Maktoum family, led by Sheikh Hamdan's father, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, has a net worth that ranges between $14 billion to $18 billion, a figure that is widely cited but likely underestimates the full scale of their wealth. In reality, due to the private nature of royal assets and the lack of public disclosures, the family's true wealth could be much higher than these estimates.Sheikh Hamdan's personal net worth, estimated between $1 billion and $2 billion, is significant but only scratches the surface of his family's total wealth. His fortune is tied to a combination of private investments, his role as Crown Prince, and assets across various industries. Below is a breakdown of his key wealth sources:Sheikh Hamdan’s love for luxury yachts is well known, and he is the proud owner of several high-end vessels:In addition to his yachts, Sheikh Hamdan has access to private jets and notably, a Boeing 747-400 from the Dubai Royal Air Wing, valued between $100 million to $270 million, offering luxurious interiors for personal and official traveSheikh Hamdan is renowned for his collection of luxury cars, many of which are limited-edition supercars. His garage reportedly includes:Along with his love for high-performance sports cars, Sheikh Hamdan has an affinity for luxury SUVs, particularly the Mercedes AMG G63, which is said to be his favourite vehicle.Sheikh Hamdan’s wealth extends far beyond cars and yachts; he is also deeply invested in real estate. His properties span Dubai and include:Sheikh Hamdan’s wealth is not confined to personal residences; his real estate investments form a substantial part of his overall fortune. Through Zabeel Investments and other holdings, he has acquired a mix of luxury residential towers, commercial developments, mansion compounds, and hospitality assets. These investments reflect both his personal tastes for opulence and his strategic role in shaping Dubai’s urban and economic landscape.This estimate combines his official residences, private estates, high-value real estate projects, and luxury lifestyle assets such as superyachts and jets. While these numbers provide a snapshot of Sheikh Hamdan’s tangible wealth, his actual financial influence and holdings likely extend far beyond these figures, particularly when considering his family’s overall fortune and the value of assets tied to the Al Maktoum dynasty.Sheikh Hamdan’s love for animals is well known, and he maintains an exclusive private zoo separate from Zabeel Palace. Located near Nad Al Sheba and close to the Dubai Desert Conservation Reserve, this private zoo houses a diverse collection of exotic animals, including white lions, giraffes, elephants, and tigers. The zoo is meticulously designed with state-of-the-art facilities, including specialized veterinary care and spacious habitats tailored to the needs of the animals.In addition to his exotic collection, Sheikh Hamdan is a passionate falconer, preserving and promoting falconry—a treasured Emirati heritage sport. He owns a private falconry centre equipped with a specialized falcon hospital, providing surgeries, X-rays, and emergency care for his prized birds. The Crown Prince actively participates in falconry competitions such as the Fazza Championship for Falconry and supports international exhibitions, showcasing his commitment to sustaining this centuries-old tradition.Sheikh Hamdan frequently shares glimpses of his animal kingdom and falconry pursuits on Instagram, where his 17 million+ followers see him interacting with elephants, giraffes, lions, and falcons. These posts highlight not only his love for wildlife but also his active role in conservation and cultural preservation.","Sheikh hamdan has made considerable investments in real estate and commercial ventures, particularly in the luxury property market.
