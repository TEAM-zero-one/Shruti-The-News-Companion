"UAE rolls out new golden visa: Lifetime residency at Rs 23 lakh, India among first to benefit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/uae-rolls-out-new-golden-visa-lifetime-residency-at-rs-23-lakh-india-among-first-to-benefit/articleshow/122280940.cms,"NEW DELHI: In a major shift from its traditional investment-based residency model, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has introduced a new nomination-based Golden Visa, offering eligible Indians lifetime residency in the country by paying a one-time fee of AED 1,00,000 (approximately Rs 23.3 lakh), without the need to invest in property or business.Until now, Indian nationals were eligible for the UAE's coveted Golden Visa programme primarily through high-value investments, including a minimum AED 2 million (Rs 4.66 crore) in property. But under this new system, applicants can be nominated and approved based on their professional background, societal contributions, or potential benefits to UAE’s sectors such as culture, trade, science, startups, or finance.The pilot phase of the initiative has been launched for India and Bangladesh, with over 5,000 Indian applicants expected in the first three months, according to officials involved in the process.Rayad Group, the consultancy firm selected to pilot the nomination-based Golden Visa in India, is leading the process in partnership with VFS and One Vasco centres across India and Bangladesh. Applications can also be submitted through the group’s online portal and call centre.""This is a golden opportunity for Indians,"" said Rayad Kamal Ayub, Managing Director of Rayad Group. He explained that the vetting process includes anti-money laundering checks, criminal background verification, and social media screening. The final nomination decision rests with UAE government authorities.Approved visa holders can bring family members, employ staff, and engage in business or professional activities. Unlike property-based visas, which lapse upon property sale, the nomination-based Golden Visa is permanent.This initiative reflects the UAE’s growing economic and strategic ties with India following the Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) signed in 2022. The program is expected to expand to other CEPA partner countries, including China, in later phases.Commenting on the move, Akash Puri, Director International, India Sotheby's International Realty said, “The recent overhaul of the UAE’s Golden Visa marks a significant shift in the country’s residency landscape. The new framework is more inclusive and strategically aligned with the UAE’s long-term vision. For Indian real estate investors, this change brings a two-pronged impact: Historically, property investment was one of the few avenues to secure long-term residency, prompting a surge of interest from Indian investors seeking both capital preservation and immigration benefits. With the visa now accessible through broader channels, the urgency to invest solely for residency purposes is likely to ease—particularly in the mid-market and entry-level segments. This could cool speculative buying and encourage more grounded investment behaviour.”“Investors who remain committed to the UAE property market—driven by rental yields, lifestyle advantages, or diversification—will now place greater emphasis on fundamentals like location, developer credibility, and long-term value. Luxury and trophy assets will continue to appeal to ultra-HNWIs, who are largely unaffected by the new professional-centric criteria. For Indian investors, this is a cue to recalibrate: from residency-led transactions to value-led strategies. Over time, this evolution could establish a more stable, resilient real estate market—one that rewards strategic, long-term participation over short-term speculation.” Akash Puri said.","The united arab emirates has introduced a new nomination-based golden visa.

NEW DELHI: An average child under the age of 5 years in India spends close to 2.2 hours daily in front of screens, double the recommended limit, according to a new study.The mean screen time for children under two years of age is 1.2 hours when most guidelines stipulate that it should be completely avoided, the study, published in a journal, Cureus, by Ashish Khobragade and M Swathi Shenoy from AIIMS Raipur, says.The two carried out a meta-analysis of 10 studies comprising 2,857 children.Increased screen time has been linked to slowed language development, decreased cognitive function and hampered social skill development, in addition to an increased risk of obesity, disturbed sleep habits and concentration issues, according to the study.To mitigate the negative impacts of excessive screen time, the study says it is crucial to create tech-free zones in a house, set clear and consistent screen time limits, and actively participate in offline play and interactions.Dr D K Gupta, a child specialist and chairman of Felix hospitals, said, ""Nearly 60-70% children under 5 years are spending more time on screen - be it mobile phone, laptop or TV - than recommended. This is a reason for some serious physical and behavioural problems among them,"" he said, adding parents should limit their children's exposure to screens while feeding them or when they are crying.""Parents should become role models for their children.They should, first, themselves reduce screen time at home,"" he added.Recently, the chief medical officer of Ghaziabad in a unique exercise issued an advisory for parents to explain the physical, mental and behavioural health issues being seen among children who are addicted to mobile phones and suggested steps such as engaging children in outdoor and social activities to wean them off the devices.Furthermore, promoting responsible digital citizenship from a young age can be achieved by setting a good example of screen habits and offering guidance on appropriate content.""I get children as young as 10- to 12-year-olds who come with their parents complaining about restlessness if the parents try to monitor their use of the internet. They get irritated and often display aggressive behaviour,"" said a doctor.","An average child under the age of 5 years in india spends close to 2.2 hours daily in front of screens.

He called the move ""premature and potentially counterproductive"", pointing to ""operational and infrastructural challenges"".The CAQM reviewed the issue and decided to delay the enforcement of the directions, news agency PTI quoted sources.The drive will now be launched on November 1 across Delhi and five adjoining high-vehicle-density districts — Gurugram, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar and Sonipat.Fuel stations in Delhi have installed Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras to identify EOL vehicles. The camera scans the number plate and checks the vehicle details, such as fuel type, age, and registration, through the VAHAN database.If the system finds a vehicle to be EOL, it alerts the fuel station staff not to refuel it. The violation is recorded and sent to enforcement agencies, who may then take action like impounding or scrapping the vehicle.The decision to postpone the ban followed public discontent and opposition, prompting the Delhi government to request CAQM to delay the rollout.The installation of ANPR cameras in the five neighbouring districts is expected to be completed by October 31, as per PTI report.",The central panel on air quality in delhi-ncr has decided to delay the implementation of the fuel ban on end-of-life (eol) or overage vehicles in delhi till november 1.

Infosys HR sends 'detailed warning email' to employees: We must work….,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/infosys-hr-sends-detailed-warning-email-to-employees-we-must-work-/articleshow/122264746.cms,"Infosys monitors remote work hours to prevent burnout

Health concerns drive policy shift in Indian IT sector

India's second-largest IT services company Infosys has begun sending personalized warning emails to employees who exceed standard working hours, directly contradicting founder N.R. Narayana Murthy 's recent advocacy for a 70-hour workweek. The Bengaluru-based firm has implemented an automated monitoring system that triggers alerts when employees work beyond 9 hours and 15 minutes daily.""We must work for 9.15 hours a day for five days a week, and if we overshoot this while working remotely, it prompts a trigger,"" an employee told The Economic Times. The company's HR department now tracks remote working hours monthly, sending detailed notifications to staff members who exceed prescribed durations.The monitoring system was introduced following hybrid working arrangements for Infosys's 323,500 employees. When excessive hours are detected, HR sends comprehensive notifications including information about remote working days, total hours worked, and daily averages. The company's workplace policy, implemented in November 2023, requires staff to be present in office for minimum 10 days monthly.""While we appreciate your commitment, we also believe that maintaining a healthy work-life balance is crucial for both your well-being and long-term professional success,"" states the HR communication reviewed by financial dailies. The emails emphasize that prioritizing health and work-life balance benefits both personal wellbeing and professional success.This initiative emerges amid growing concerns about young tech professionals facing health challenges, particularly cardiac issues attributed to irregular dietary and rest patterns. The company's guidance includes specific recommendations: ""Take regular breaks during your workday; Let your manager know if you are feeling overwhelmed or need support with reviewing priorities.""The policy represents a significant departure from Murthy's recent statements calling for Indians to work 70 hours weekly to accelerate economic growth. The move reflects evolving workplace norms in Indian IT sector , where employee mental health and sustainable productivity are gaining prominence over extended working hours.","Infosys has implemented an automated monitoring system that triggers alerts when employees work beyond 9 hours and 15 minutes daily.

Connor McDavid contract extension: NHL analyst predicts $16–18 million short-term deal with Oilers,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/connor-mcdavid-contract-extension-nhl-analyst-predicts-1618-million-short-term-deal-with-edmonton-oilers/articleshow/122321306.cms,"Connor McDavid may sign $16–18M if Oilers compete (Image via: Getty Images)

NHL Insider predicts $16M–$18M short-term deal for Connor McDavid



Can the Oilers afford to risk losing Connor McDavid in free agency?



Connor McDavid is officially eligible to sign a contract extension, and the buzz around his next deal is already heating up. With just two seasons remaining on his current eight-year, $100 million contract, the Edmonton Oilers face mounting pressure to lock up the NHL’s biggest superstar before free agency becomes a real threat.On TSN’s FanDuel Overdrive, NHL analyst Martin Biron weighed in on what kind of extension the Oilers captain could command. With the NHL salary cap projected to rise to $103.5 million, McDavid can legally sign a deal worth up to 20% of the cap, approximately $20.7 million per year.But Biron doesn’t expect McDavid to chase the full max. Instead, he predicts a short-term, two-year bridge deal worth between $16 million and $18 million per season. That number would still make McDavid the highest-paid player in NHL history while allowing Edmonton to retain enough cap space to improve the roster around him.However, Biron issued a clear warning. McDavid could accept a slightly lower salary, but only if the Oilers meet key conditions. “I think $18 million is the number,” said Biron. “But I wouldn’t be surprised if Connor McDavid, if the Oilers are solid, says, ‘I’ll go to $16 million on a two-year deal.’But you know that’s coming with strings attached, if it’s not good, it’s bye-bye, and I’m gone.”McDavid is coming off another elite season with 100 points in 67 regular-season games and 33 points in 22 playoff appearances. He’s led the Oilers to consecutive Stanley Cup Final trips, but Edmonton has failed to close the deal, falling short again to the Florida Panthers.The Oilers now face a crucial moment to build a championship-caliber team around McDavid now, or risk losing him in 2026 free agency. With 2026 free agency approaching, Connor McDavid’s future forces Oilers to build a Stanley Cup team or risk losing him.Also Read: Sidney Crosby Trade Rumors: NHL Insider links Penguins star to Canadiens for final cup run This looming decision could define the next decade of NHL power dynamics.

Microsoft plans third round of layoffs this year



Poll Do you support Microsoft’s decision to lay off employees in the sales division? No Yes

Microsoft is preparing to eliminate thousands of jobs primarily tatgetting its sales division. Microsoft is expected to announce the layoffs early this month as the company continues its restructuring amid massive AI investments. Now just ahead of the fresh round of layoffs, Microsoft’s top sales executive Judson Althoff is stepping away for an eight-week sabbatical.As reported by Bloomberg, the company has confirmed Judson Althoff’s sabbatical. Judson Althoff who works as the chief commercial officer will resume his role in September after Microsoft will close the fiscal year. A company spokesperson told Bloomeberg that the sabbatical was planned and aligned with the company’s internal calendar, stating, “He will be back with his team in September.”This move of Judson Althoff’s sabbatical comes as Microsoft is planning to layoffs thousands of employees, particularly from the sales and marketing division . The layoffs will mark the third major workforce reduction this year for the Redmond-based tech giant, following 6,000 cuts in May and over 300 additional eliminations just weeks later. Bloomberg first reported the planned summer layoffs, with sources indicating the timing coincides with the start of Microsoft's new fiscal year beginning in July.Unlike previous rounds that primarily affected software engineers and product developers, the upcoming cuts will disproportionately target customer-facing roles. Microsoft's sales and marketing division employs approximately 45,000 of the company's 228,000 total workforce as of June 2024.The company signaled this shift in April this year when it announced plans to use third-party firms to handle more software sales to small and mid-sized customers. Sources told Bloomberg the reductions won't exclusively affect sales teams, though they will bear the brunt of the cuts.","Microsoft's top sales executive judson althoff is stepping away for an eight-week sabbatical.

GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke says the companies that best leverage artificial intelligence won't use it to replace human developers, but instead will dramatically increase their engineering hiring to capitalize on AI-enhanced productivity gains.""The companies that are the smartest are going to hire more developers,"" Dohmke said in a recent podcast interview.

Why AI may devalue skills, not just eliminate jobs



How skills become obsolete:

Automation of routine tasks : Industries like typing, factory work, and taxi driving saw initial waves of automation. With AI, even roles requiring moderate skill—like legal document review or marketing analysis—are now at risk.

: Industries like typing, factory work, and taxi driving saw initial waves of automation. With AI, even roles requiring moderate skill—like legal document review or marketing analysis—are now at risk. Commoditised skills: Resources like touch typing were once prized. Once AI can perform those actions without fatigue or error, such skills lose their edge.

The ‘Mad Max’ comparison: What it means



Concentrated gains : Wealth and influence accrue to companies and individuals who own AI systems.

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is reshaping our world in profound ways—from improving medical diagnostics to powering chatbots and self-driving cars. But not all of its impacts are positive. In a Business Insider interview on the “Possible” podcast, MIT economist David Autor sounded a serious caution: AI could turn our labour market into something resembling a Mad Max wasteland. While this doesn’t mean total job loss, it does mean something equally alarming—the devaluation of once-valuable skills, pushing many into poorly paid work with limited advancement, as reported by Business Insider.This warning comes amid broader studies, such as a Salesforce projection that up to 23% of the workforce could be redeployed due to AI in the next two years (Business Insider, citing Salesforce). The underlying concern is clear: AI may not take jobs outright, but it could severely undermine what makes work valuable.Autor’s analogy to Mad Max warns of a world where technology runs rampant and wealth concentrates at the top. Instead of liberation, AI could exacerbate income inequality and leave most people scrambling for low-end service roles. This article explores Autor’s caution, what’s driving this concern, which sectors are most vulnerable, and why intentional design and workforce planning are critical to avoid an AI-driven dystopia.Autor argues that the threat AI poses is more subtle than mass unemployment. Instead of taking jobs, it may strip roles of their expert value, turning once-specialised skills into commodities.“The threat… is not running out of work, but making the valuable skills that people have highly abundant so they’re no longer valuable,” Autor explained.Autor’s bleak vision is inspired by the Mad Max universe—a world marked by scarcity, brutal competition, and centralised power. He sees an economic parallel: AI empowers a few, while the majority struggle.A Salesforce study cited by Business Insider estimates that 23% of the global workforce may be redeployed in the next two years due to increased AI adoption. This includes changes in roles, responsibilities, or sectors.While not everyone will lose their job, many may find themselves working in different, less lucrative positions—a dangerous shift that Autor warns could erode societal well-being if not managed.Autor emphasises these roles as critical to ensuring AI serves humans, not the other way around.Autor recognises the potential for AI to enhance human capabilities—but only if implemented thoughtfully. He urges:“The future is not a forecasting exercise—it’s a design exercise,” Autor said, as reported in Business Insider.He insists the AI future must be built deliberately, not left to chance.","Artificial intelligence (ai) is reshaping our world in profound ways.
