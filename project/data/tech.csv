"Centre plans 'battery passport' to boost EV safety, quality & exports",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-plans-battery-passport-to-boost-ev-safety-quality-exports/articleshow/122308453.cms,"A battery passport serves as an Aadhaar identity of sorts, with every battery having a unique ID that provides all information on the product

NEW DELHI: In a move that will help owners of electric vehicles (EVs) get precise details of the batteries being used, India will soon have its own ""Battery Passport"" regime. Under the system, the specifications of every battery, including its origin, performance, composition, end of life and the entire supply cycle will be captured digitally and embedded in a QR code. Niti Aayog has started deliberations with ministries and govt departments on the proposed framework, sources said. Officials highlighted that a battery passport serves as an Aadhaar identity of sorts, with every battery having a unique ID that provides all information on the product.The initiative will not only improve safety and quality standards but also accelerate export of EVs from India. Significantly, India is offering incentives to global EV players to set up plants and export their vehicles from India. It will also be crucial when govt rolls out a battery swapping policy for vehicles, allowing owners to access details of batteries by scanning the QR code printed on them.The need for such a regime was first felt after a series of fire incidents involving electric two-wheelers and cars. Industry insiders said there had been instances of companies importing battery cells of different vintages and using them as part of the same modules.""When cells made in different years are joined together, there is more load on new cells, as the older ones are closer to their expiry date. Such a module impacts performance and can be a safety hazard,"" said a source.Officials privy to govt's plan said once the battery passport system is implemented, it will be possible to ensure that cells in any battery are manufactured in the same year. Through it, users will get to know about the lifecycle and performance of batteries, which is key considering they account for nearly 40% of the costs of EVs, an official said.A source said, ""This move will help achieve three major goals: trade (export of electric vehicles), safety and quality"".The European Union in 2023 enacted the Battery Regulation making it mandatory for every industrial or EV battery in EU with a capacity of over 2 kWh to have a battery passport. It will come into force on Feb 1, 2027. The battery passports will require inputs from mining and refining companies, cell and battery producers, vehicle brands, and battery servicing, refurbishing, and recycling companies.The EU rules specify that the battery passport must contain all information, including unique identifier, basic characteristics of the battery including type and model, updated statistics on performance and durability, and carbon footprint specific to the manufacturing site and batch of batteries. This information will need to be selectively shared with three groups: the general public, regulatory bodies, and battery service and end-of-life processors.","The specifications of every battery, including its origin, performance, composition, end of life and the entire supply cycle will be captured digitally and embedded in a qr code.

This deal does not require her to be on a full-time schedule in matches but rather makes her available for special appearances during promotions and related activities.Nikki had avoided wrestling due to injuries and family life but made a return at the 2025 Royal Rumble in a big way.

The pictures have Kylie Jenner posing under the sun in a Ralph Lauren polka dot bra and pants.The caption of the post reads as, “a polka dot summer” and it has sparked a frenzy among fans.Tom Brady’s ex wife, Gisele Bündchen, a former Victoria’s Secret model once walked on the ramp many decades ago in the same Ralph Lauren set that Kylie Jenner was spotted wearing. Kylie Jenner even posted a stunning picture of Gisele Bündchen walking on the runway in the stunning set, on her Instagram story.This move of Kylie Jenner’s comes at a time when she was spotted enjoying Jeff Bezos’ lavish wedding alongside her sister, Kendal Jenner, while there are rumours of Tom Brady and Hollywood actresses, including Sydney Sweeney and Dakota Johnson, who were all spotted at the same wedding.According to TMZ Sports, there have been a few speculations about the nature of the relationship between Tom Brady and Sydney Sweeney after the NFL legend was spotted dancing at the wedding bar with her but it does not seem it has the potential to turn into something serious.A few months ago, as per People, a source had revealed that Sydney Sweeney is not looking for a relationship.The source said, “She’s exactly where she wants to be…Most people would feel overwhelmed by her working schedule this year, but not Syd.

Carolina Hurricanes’ offer sheet pressure forced the Edmonton Oilers to move quickly on Evan Bouchard deal

Edmonton Oilers take swift action to avoid repeating last summer’s costly offer sheet losses

In a surprising twist this offseason, the Edmonton Oilers moved quickly to secure defenseman Evan Bouchard with a lucrative four-year extension worth $10.5 million annually. While many viewed it as a smart long-term move, recent reports suggest the decision wasn’t entirely strategic, it was reactive. According to Elliotte Friedman, the Carolina Hurricanes forced Edmonton’s hand by threatening to submit an offer sheet for Bouchard, escalating contract talks dramatically.According to Friedman’s report, newly appointed Hurricanes general manager Eric Tulsky considered extending an offer sheet to Evan Bouchard, an aggressive but legal tactic rarely used in the NHL. While the Edmonton Oilers likely had every intention of matching any offer, the idea of entering another public contract standoff was enough to prompt them to lock Bouchard down quickly and avoid the risk.The move comes just a year after the Oilers lost two young players, Dylan Holloway and Philip Broberg after they declined to match competing offer sheets. That experience left the organization wary of any further vulnerability. With Bouchard being their only remaining restricted free agent susceptible to an offer sheet, Edmonton acted decisively to avoid another offseason distraction.Carolina’s use of the offer sheet threat wasn’t limited to Edmonton.Friedman also reported that the Hurricanes explored a similar tactic with the New York Rangers involving defenseman K’Andre Miller. However, instead of battling it out, Carolina worked out a deal directly with Miller, who ultimately signed a long-term contract with the Hurricanes.For the Oilers, the memory of losing two rising talents without compensation likely fueled a no-nonsense approach this time around. With Evan Bouchard now secured through the 2028–29 season, Edmonton can enter the upcoming campaign without further offer sheet worries hanging over them.The Carolina Hurricanes’ bold negotiation tactics served as a wake-up call for the Edmonton Oilers. Rather than risk another offseason filled with uncertainty and potential player loss, the team ensured Evan Bouchard remained part of their long-term plans. With this major contract now behind them, the Oilers can focus fully on their 2025–26 goals without fear of another offer sheet surprise.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Montreal Canadiens still targeting Jordan Kyrou in potential blockbuster deal","Carolina hurricanes’ offer sheet pressure forced the edmonton oilers to move quickly on evan bouchard deal.

"Tech Layoffs 2025: Over 1 lakh jobs cut as Microsoft, Google, Amazon lead mass firings; is AI to blame",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/tech-layoffs-2025-over-1-lakh-jobs-cut-as-microsoft-google-amazon-lead-mass-firings-is-ai-to-blame/articleshow/122255057.cms,"Tech Layoffs 2025: Over 1 lakh jobs cut as Microsoft, Google, Infosys lead mass firings

Microsoft cuts 9,100 jobs in second layoff of the year



Intel slashes factory workforce and shuts automotive unit



Google cuts 25% of Google TV staff amid budget reductions



Amazon begins AI-led downsizing across divisions



Why are so many tech jobs being cut



Shifting to AI and automation: Companies are investing billions in AI, cloud infrastructure, and automation technologies. To fund this shift, they are cutting back on roles that don’t align with their future direction.

Cost cutting: Rising interest rates, inflation, and slower growth have forced many companies to tighten their budgets. Layoffs help reduce immediate costs, especially in departments that are no longer seen as essential.

Reorganizing teams: Many tech firms are changing how their teams work. This includes outsourcing, merging departments, and removing duplicated roles across global offices.

Decline in some product markets: Demand for products like personal computers, gaming consoles, and smart TVs has decreased. This affects business units tied to these categories, making them prime targets for cuts.

Who is being affected?



Mid-level developers and engineers at Intel and Microsoft

Marketing, sales, and legal teams

Gaming and entertainment divisions

Regional offices, especially in the US and India

The global tech industry is facing one of its toughest years in 2025. More than 100,000 jobs have already been cut across major technology companies. Big names like Microsoft, Intel, Google, and Amazon are all reducing their workforces, citing reasons such as slowing growth, rising operational costs, and the need to shift resources toward artificial intelligence (AI) and automation. These job cuts are affecting workers at all levels—from fresh graduates to senior engineers—across different countries and departments.While companies say the layoffs are necessary to streamline operations and prepare for the future, the impact on employees and the broader tech job market is massive. The shake-up is not just about reducing headcount—it signals a major transformation in how the industry is evolving. Businesses are now focused on becoming leaner and more AI-driven, even if that means letting go of long-standing teams or changing their traditional work models.Microsoft has confirmed that it is laying off about 9,100 employees in July 2025. This is the company’s second major round of layoffs this year. In May, Microsoft had already let go of 6,000 workers, mainly from engineering and product roles.This new wave represents nearly 4% of the company’s total workforce and is affecting departments such as Xbox gaming, sales, legal, and teams behind mobile game titles like Candy Crush.Microsoft says these job cuts are part of a broader plan to reorganize and invest in AI infrastructure, for which it is committing around $80 billion over the next few years. The company is also restructuring its sales teams and outsourcing more work to smaller partners.Intel, one of the world’s largest semiconductor manufacturers, is cutting up to 20% of its factory workforce, which translates to over 10,000 jobs. These layoffs are scheduled for mid-July and include 107 roles in Silicon Valley, specifically at Intel’s Santa Clara headquarters.The company is also shutting down its automotive chip division, which shows that even once-promising product lines are being dropped as Intel tightens its spending.Intel says the decision is part of its plan to deal with “financial constraints and affordability goals.” The company has faced falling demand in the PC and server markets and is now trying to shift focus toward AI chips and next-gen computing.At Google, layoffs are affecting more niche product divisions. The Google TV team has seen a 25% reduction, which reportedly accounts for about 75 employees.The budget for the Google TV unit was cut by 10%, prompting the company to downsize its workforce. Additionally, in June, Google began offering buyouts and voluntary exit packages, signalling that more layoffs may follow later this year.These actions come as Google, like many other tech firms, shifts more resources toward AI development and away from smaller or lower-priority products.Amazon has joined the wave of major tech layoffs in 2025, initiating targeted job cuts across several divisions as part of a broader strategy to integrate artificial intelligence into its operations. In June, the company eliminated fewer than 100 roles within its Books division, impacting teams behind Kindle and Goodreads, as it moved to streamline underperforming units. CEO Andy Jassy confirmed in a June memo that Amazon plans to further shrink its corporate workforce, citing the growing role of generative AI in automating repetitive and administrative tasks.Departments such as customer service, software development, human resources, and middle management are expected to face future cuts as AI tools take over internal processes and reduce the need for multiple layers of oversight.Since 2022, Amazon has already laid off more than 27,000 employees, and the trend appears to be continuing as the company prioritizes efficiency and technological advancement in a rapidly evolving digital landscape.There are several reasons behind the widespread layoffs in the tech industry in 2025:These layoffs are impacting a wide range of roles and experience levels, including:This shows that no job category is fully immune. Even high-performing tech employees are vulnerable if their role is not aligned with a company’s new priorities.","Microsoft has confirmed that it is laying off about 9,100 employees in july 2025.

Health concerns drive policy shift in Indian IT sector

India's second-largest IT services company Infosys has begun sending personalized warning emails to employees who exceed standard working hours, directly contradicting founder N.R. Narayana Murthy 's recent advocacy for a 70-hour workweek. The Bengaluru-based firm has implemented an automated monitoring system that triggers alerts when employees work beyond 9 hours and 15 minutes daily.""We must work for 9.15 hours a day for five days a week, and if we overshoot this while working remotely, it prompts a trigger,"" an employee told The Economic Times. The company's HR department now tracks remote working hours monthly, sending detailed notifications to staff members who exceed prescribed durations.The monitoring system was introduced following hybrid working arrangements for Infosys's 323,500 employees. When excessive hours are detected, HR sends comprehensive notifications including information about remote working days, total hours worked, and daily averages. The company's workplace policy, implemented in November 2023, requires staff to be present in office for minimum 10 days monthly.""While we appreciate your commitment, we also believe that maintaining a healthy work-life balance is crucial for both your well-being and long-term professional success,"" states the HR communication reviewed by financial dailies. The emails emphasize that prioritizing health and work-life balance benefits both personal wellbeing and professional success.This initiative emerges amid growing concerns about young tech professionals facing health challenges, particularly cardiac issues attributed to irregular dietary and rest patterns. The company's guidance includes specific recommendations: ""Take regular breaks during your workday; Let your manager know if you are feeling overwhelmed or need support with reviewing priorities.""The policy represents a significant departure from Murthy's recent statements calling for Indians to work 70 hours weekly to accelerate economic growth. The move reflects evolving workplace norms in Indian IT sector , where employee mental health and sustainable productivity are gaining prominence over extended working hours.","Infosys has implemented an automated monitoring system that triggers alerts when employees work beyond 9 hours and 15 minutes daily.

Microsoft plans third round of layoffs this year



Poll Do you support Microsoft’s decision to lay off employees in the sales division? No Yes

Microsoft is preparing to eliminate thousands of jobs primarily tatgetting its sales division. Microsoft is expected to announce the layoffs early this month as the company continues its restructuring amid massive AI investments. Now just ahead of the fresh round of layoffs, Microsoft’s top sales executive Judson Althoff is stepping away for an eight-week sabbatical.As reported by Bloomberg, the company has confirmed Judson Althoff’s sabbatical. Judson Althoff who works as the chief commercial officer will resume his role in September after Microsoft will close the fiscal year. A company spokesperson told Bloomeberg that the sabbatical was planned and aligned with the company’s internal calendar, stating, “He will be back with his team in September.”This move of Judson Althoff’s sabbatical comes as Microsoft is planning to layoffs thousands of employees, particularly from the sales and marketing division . The layoffs will mark the third major workforce reduction this year for the Redmond-based tech giant, following 6,000 cuts in May and over 300 additional eliminations just weeks later. Bloomberg first reported the planned summer layoffs, with sources indicating the timing coincides with the start of Microsoft's new fiscal year beginning in July.Unlike previous rounds that primarily affected software engineers and product developers, the upcoming cuts will disproportionately target customer-facing roles. Microsoft's sales and marketing division employs approximately 45,000 of the company's 228,000 total workforce as of June 2024.The company signaled this shift in April this year when it announced plans to use third-party firms to handle more software sales to small and mid-sized customers. Sources told Bloomberg the reductions won't exclusively affect sales teams, though they will bear the brunt of the cuts.","Microsoft's top sales executive judson althoff is stepping away for an eight-week sabbatical.

GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke says the companies that best leverage artificial intelligence won't use it to replace human developers, but instead will dramatically increase their engineering hiring to capitalize on AI-enhanced productivity gains.""The companies that are the smartest are going to hire more developers,"" Dohmke said in a recent podcast interview. ""Because if you 10x a single developer, then 10 developers can do 100x.""The GitHub CEO argues that AI serves as a powerful multiplier for engineering talent rather than a replacement, making individual developers significantly more efficient while creating demand for additional skilled professionals. He believes current industry layoffs and hiring freezes represent a temporary market adjustment as companies figure out AI's true potential.Dohmke emphasized that while AI has made programming more accessible to beginners and streamlined workflows for experienced developers, it hasn't eliminated the need for deep technical expertise in business environments. He dismissed the notion that AI alone can build billion-dollar companies without substantial coding knowledge.""I think the idea that AI without any coding skills lets you just build a billion-dollar business is mistaken,"" he said. ""Because if that would be the case, everyone would do it.""Rather than draining development backlogs, Dohmke observed that AI has actually generated more work by enabling teams to tackle previously impossible projects.

Crypto investors or virtual asset holders are not included in the official list of eligible categories.

Authorities Urge Caution and Verification





In response to growing misinformation circulating online, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has officially clarified that Golden Visas are not being issued to cryptocurrency investors. The statement, made by three key national regulatory bodies, firmly denied claims suggesting otherwise.The joint clarification was released by the Federal Authority for Identity and Citizenship, Customs and Ports Security (ICP), the Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA), and the Virtual Assets Regulatory Authority (VARA).The statement was prompted by false reports on websites and social media platforms, which suggested that holders of virtual assets, particularly cryptocurrency, were eligible for the UAE’s long-term Golden Residency visa.A specific claim drew attention after Max Crown, CEO of the Ton Foundation, tweeted on July 6 that Ton holders had “the exclusive chance to secure a 10-year Golden Visa” after paying a one-time fee of $35,000, subject to other conditions. This assertion quickly spread online, leading to confusion among investors.Responding directly to these claims, VARA clarified that Ton is not licensed or regulated by the authority.It also stated that any licensed “company” must strictly adhere to visa procedures set by the Dubai government. VARA further confirmed that “claims of granting golden residency to virtual asset investors in the Emirate of Dubai are false”, and urged the public to interact only with licensed and regulated companies.The ICP clarified that the long-term Golden Residency visa is available only to specific groups, such as:The Securities and Commodities Authority (SCA) echoed the warnings, stating that digital currency investments are governed by strict regulations and that “such investments are not linked to a Golden Visa.” The SCA emphasized the need for investors to rely on credible and official sources of information.All three authorities jointly advised the public to verify any information related to investment benefits and visa privileges directly from official government websites or approved channels. They also strongly cautioned against engaging with unreliable advertisements or offers found online.Finally, for accurate and up-to-date details about Golden Residency conditions, the public is encouraged to visit the ICP’s official website.","Uae authorities clarify that golden visas are not granted to cryptocurrency investors amid rising misinformation.

Logically, Britain’s largest fact-checking company started by an India-born entrepreneur that once had assignments from Indian, UK and US govts as well as social media giants, has gone into “administration” -- a legal process where a debt-defaulting firm seeks court protection to restructure and avoid liquidation.One of the key reasons why Logically, founded by Lyric Jain in 2017, folded up was social media giants moving away from AI-enabled fact checking. Meta and TikTok did not renew their contracts this year. Pressure on social media giants to fact-check has eased since US President Donald Trump took charge the second time early this year. Logically’s assets have been transferred to another company called Kreatur as part of the “administration” process.Jain had founded Logically with backing from private investors. He had moved to the UK from Mysore at age 12. The company’s clients included US federal agencies, India’s Election Commission, Mumbai police, Karnataka, J&K and Assam govts. It also worked for Britain’s counter-disinformation unit during the pandemic and on debunking disinformation ahead of 2020 US elections.Having won lucrative fact-checking contracts with TikTok and Meta earlier, Logically once boasted over 100 staff in the UK, India and US.“The cost of doing fact-checking was getting increasingly expensive. When TikTok’s contract came up for renewal they offered a paltry amount not sufficient for running the technology. So, they went their separate ways. Meta did not renew because it was moving towards community-led fact checkers,” a source close to Logically told TOI.Around the same time, the firm lost certification from International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), allegedly because the industry body does not allow fact-checkers to work for govts.UK’s The Times newspaper claimed Logically being hired by Karnataka govt in early 2024 to set up a fact-checking unit to parse misinformation ahead of the Lok Sabha elections last summer led to the firm losing its certification. However, a source contested that version. “Karnataka govt did a proof of concept contract with Logically but nothing has happened ever since. IFCN does not have a monopoly on fact-checking,” the source said.The same source disputed claims about Logically “losing” certification. “We didn’t renew it. Fact-checking with platforms was not an attractive business. Logically was gradually winding up that side of business to focus on corporate and govt customers for information advantage and providing competitive intelligence,” the source said.A spokesperson for Kreatur, to which Logically’s assets have been channelled, confirmed the move. “Kreatur Ltd has acquired Logically’s core technology, brand, and key assets as part of a pre-pack administration process. The transaction ensures continuity for all customers and has preserved over 50 full-time roles,” the spokesperson said.","Logically, britain’s largest fact-checking company started by an india-born entrepreneur, has gone into “administration’ logically once had assignments from indian, uk and us govts as well as social media giants.
