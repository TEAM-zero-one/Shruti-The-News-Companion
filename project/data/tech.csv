NEW DELHI: The Indian Army is on the cusp of becoming the world’s first armed force to operationally deploy ramjet-powered artillery shells for its 155 mm guns. The advanced technology, developed in collaboration with the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Madras and with support of Army Technology Board (ATB), is now under trial.Ramjet propulsion is not new and has been used in missiles worldwide. However, applying the technology to artillery shells is a revolutionary step.Professors P A Ramakrishna and S Verma from IIT Madras' Department of Aerospace Engineering co-developed a ramjet-powered artillery shell after years of research. The technology, developed under the Atmanirbhar Bharat initiative, is designed to significantly extend the reach of standard tube artillery.Prof Ramakrishna recently explained that a ramjet operates as an air-breathing engine that does not require turbines or compressors. It relies on the shell being launched to speeds of approx Mach 2 using an artillery gun. At this velocity, air entering the engine is naturally compressed, fuel is ignited and thrust is produced, which allows the shell to maintain propulsion and significantly extend its range.“Being an air-breathing engine, ramjet has higher specific impulse (ISP) (> 4000 N s/kg) compared to that of a solid rocket (~2500 N s/kg) and, therefore, provides much higher overall impulse to the shell for the same mass of propellant,” the IIT-M research paper said.One of the key challenges IIT-M team faced was using ramjet to have high combustion efficiency with restricted secondary combustor length. However, the team managed to overcome this obstacle.The technology promises to extend the range of conventional artillery shells by 30% to 50% while maintaining their destructive power. By integrating ramjet technology into 155 mm shells, the Army obtained the ability to strike deeper targets with greater effectiveness. Developmental trials are currently under way, with successful tests already conducted at the Pokhran field firing ranges. These trials have demonstrated the feasibility of retrofitting ramjet modules onto existing 155 mm shells, meaning the technology can be applied across the Army’s current inventory without requiring entirely new ammunition designs.Once the ramjet artillery shell technology is ready for induction, it can be used in any of the Army’s artillery systems, including on the US-imported M777 ultra-light howitzer.","The indian army is on the cusp of becoming the world’s first armed force to operationally deploy ramjet-powered artillery shells for its 155 mm guns.

Jio dominates November subscriber count with 1.2 million additions; extends lead over Airtel for 9th consecutive month,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jio-dominates-november-subscriber-count-with-1-2-million-additions-extends-lead-over-airtel-for-9th-consecutive-month/articleshow/126325423.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Reliance Jio continued its subscriber growth in November 2025, leading the industry in overall wireless additions and active user gains as per the latest monthly subscription data released by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI).The TRAI data showed that Jio added 1.2 million subscribers, extending its lead over Bharti Airtel for the ninth consecutive month.The performance came during a period when the industry's total active (Visitor Location Register) subscribers fell by 3.4 million to 1,091 million. While other major operators reported net losses in active users, Jio was the only player to post positive gains.Specifically, Vodafone Idea (VIL) saw a drop of 2.2 million active users, while Bharti Airtel recorded a decline of 1.7 million.The momentum for Jio was reflected in its market share, with the operator gaining VLR share in 17 out of 22 telecom circles. The most significant gains were observed in the Jammu & Kashmir and Punjab regions.Morgan Stanley noted that ""RJio's market share rose to 43.7% (+25bps MoM), while all other operators lost market share MoM."" This trend further reduced the active subscriber share gap between Jio and Bharti Airtel to an all-time low.In the broadband segment, Jio maintained its dominance by capturing approximately 68 per cent of the total additions across mobile broadband, fixed wireless access (FWA), and unlicensed band radio (UBR). Jio remained ahead of Bharti Airtel in overall broadband rollouts primarily due to its UBR expansion, which added 0.35 million users during the month.The data also highlighted Jio's strength in the fixed wireless segment. Morgan Stanley reported that ""on FWA, Jio added almost 2.5x FWA subs (FWA 5G+ FWA UBR) vs Airtel."" Both Jio and Bharti Airtel added 0.25 million 5G FWA subscribers each, but Jio's additional UBR gains solidified its lead in the home broadband category.Despite the pullback in active subscribers during November, the sector's active additions for the 2025 calendar year to date remain at a nine-year high. Industry observers expect that the current subscriber additions and rising data penetration will support future growth in Average Revenue Per User (ARPU) as the market construct remains favourable.","Reliance jio continued its subscriber growth in november 2025, leading the industry in overall wireless additions and active user gains.

"Like commercial vehicles, soon private vehicles need to get fitness test done at automated testing stations",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/like-commercial-vehicles-soon-private-vehicles-need-to-get-fitness-test-done-at-automated-testing-stations/articleshow/126275967.cms,"Representational photo

NEW DELHI: Soon all private vehicles like cars and bikes will have to get their fitness and pollution tests done at automated test stations (ATS) for renewal of registration as it is in the case of commercial vehicles. The ATS or the inspecting officer will also need to upload at least a 10 seconds geotagged video of the vehicle at the time of fitness test before issuing any certificate.The road transport ministry has proposed key changes in the Central Motor Vehicles Rules, including this, through a draft notification to prevent the malpractice of vehicle owners managing to get fitness certificates even without visiting ATS or other testing centres. This also gains significance in the light of increasing concern over air pollution and fitness of vehicles.Fitness certificate is mandatory for renewal of registration of private vehicles after attaining 15 years, and subsequently, in every five years.As per the draft notification, private vehicles, like commercial ones, will need to visit ATS, where these are established, for fitness tests. At present, there are over 160 ATS operational across the country.To ensure that the certificates are issued after carrying out genuine tests, the draft notification says that “the renewal of a certificate of fitness shall be made only after uploading at least a 10 seconds geotagged video of the vehicle at the time of fitness test, capturing the vehicle from front, rear, right side and left side ensuring clear visibility of the registration number plate, chassis number, engine number and features of the vehicle” by an authorised testing station or inspecting officer after carrying out the specified tests.In a bid to avoid vehicle owners using legal provisions to apply for multiple re-tests after vehicles fail to pass the fitness test, the proposed norms say that if a vehicle is not declared as ‘fit’ within 180 days from the first date of vehicle declared as ‘unfit’ the vehicle shall be categorised as ‘End of Life Vehicle (ELV)’ and flagged in the Vahan database as ‘ELV’.Officials said till now people used to get the timeline extended by simply submitting fees just days before the expiry of 180 days. “That won’t be possible any more. They need to get the fitness certificate within 180 days from the day the first test found the vehicle as unfit. Enough safeguards have been put in place to ensure that any ATS doesn’t give incorrect test result,” said an official.",The road transport ministry has proposed key changes in the central motor vehicles rules.

One hand bag rule vital amid power bank fire fears: Experts,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/one-hand-bag-rule-vital-amid-power-bank-fire-fears-experts/articleshow/126329997.cms,"DGCA Plans New Rules For Power Banks On Flights After Fire Scare On IndiGo Plane

NEW DELHI: India has barred the use of power banks to charge portable electronic devices inflight. Charging power banks by plugging them to in-seat power supply systems that airlines provide is also no longer allowed.Permitted only in hand bags, flyers are no longer supposed to keep power banks and batteries in overhead bins. This comes after instances of lithium batteries catching fire mid-flight.DGCA recently issued a ‘dangerous goods advisory circular’ to minimise risks from lithium battery-powered devices carried by passengers and crew members.The regulator has directed airlines to make inflight announcements regarding the new rules. Passengers need to “immediately inform cabin crew if any device emits heat, smoke or an unusual odour”, the rules say, adding that airlines must “promptly report all safety issues and occurrences related to lithium battery incidents to DGCA”. Some other countries and airlines, including Emirates and Singapore Airlines, had issued similar restrictions for the same reason last year.Aviation experts warn that airlines should strictly implement the one-hand-bag-per-passenger rule in wake of this new fear.The reason: While batteries and power banks are not allowed in check-in bags, airlines very often take hand bags — which have portable electronic devices (PEDs) and power banks — at boarding gates or aerobridgesfrom passengers and keep them in the belly of aircraft, as overhead bins are full.“This defeats the purpose of not allowing batteries in check-in bags. A battery catching fire in baggage hold, remaining undetected and then spreading can have serious consequences. The issue of how much cabin bags flyers carry onboard needs to be tackled either by airlines on their own. And if they can’t do so, rules need to be in place to ensure lithium batteries do not make it to baggage hold,” said a senior pilot.The new DGCA circular says: “The widespread usage of lithium batteries in various rechargeable devices has led to an increase in carriage of lithium batteries by air. Power banks, portable chargers, and similar devices containing lithium batteries can act as ignition sources and potentially initiate on-board fires. Lithium batteries placed in overhead stowage bins or within carry-on baggage may be obscured, difficult to access, or not readily monitored by passengers or crew members. This may result in delayed detection of smoke or fire and response actions, increasing the potential hazard to flight safety.”Lithium battery fires are very “energetic” and can cause PEDs to explode. “A lithium battery fire can be started by uncontrolled heating, overcharging, crushing or internal short circuit triggered by poor manufacturing quality, aged batteries or damage due to mishandling. Unlike other fires, lithium battery fires may be self-sustaining and require special methods to handle. The general preventive measures to minimise risks of lithium battery fire may include minimising possibilities of heating of devices; early detection in case of fire; and reinforcement of effectiveness of firefighting procedures,” it adds.",Dgca recently issued a ‘dangerous goods advisory circular’ to minimise risks from lithium battery-powered devices carried by passengers and crew members.

Peyton Manning's endorsement deals





Peyton Manning never relied only on arm strength to define his career. From the moment he entered the NFL in 1998, his sharp football mind and calm leadership style made him stand out. He did not just win games. He changed how the quarterback position was played and how stars could build value beyond the field.It's been years since HOF hung up his cleats, but his financial success still shows his football career. His smart contracts, endorsements, and long-term business planning helped him turn his eminence on Sundays into a longstanding enterprise that continues to grow in 2026.At present, Peyton Manning’s net worth is $300 million, per Celebrity Net Worth. His wealth comes from his NFL salary, endorsements, and investments.Manning played 18 NFL seasons from 1998 to 2015. He spent 14 years with the Indianapolis Colts and four with the Denver Broncos. Over that span, he earned roughly $115 million in NFL salary alone. His biggest deal came in March 2012, when he signed a five-year, $96 million contract with Denver after undergoing neck surgery that ended his Colts' run.At his peak, Manning made about $18 million per year in base salary. His career accolades added value to his brand. He won two Super Bowls in February 2007 and February 2016, earned five NFL MVP awards, and made 14 Pro Bowls. He retired in March 2016 after winning Super Bowl 50 and entered the Pro Football Hall of Fame in August 2021.Even after football, Manning stayed visible. His Omaha Productions company became a major player in the media industry. In August 2023, the company sold a minority stake at a reported valuation of $750 million, boosting Manning’s long-term wealth.Endorsements played an even bigger role in building Manning’s fortune.

From late-round draft pick to one of the Jaguars’ most trusted linemen





The Jacksonville Jaguars’ rise to a 12-4 record was a steady buildup, and one player who has embodied and anchored the team’s performance and stability is offensive guard Cole Van Lanen. Van Lanen’s NFL journey began without much fanfare, and it began when he was selected by the Green Bay Packers in the sixth round of the 2021 NFL Draft.His rookie contract reflected that status, a four-year deal worth $3.6 million with limited guaranteed money. He appeared in just one season for Green Bay, earning roughly $248,000, before his career took a new direction. When the Jaguars brought him in during 2022, they assumed a modest portion of his rookie contract.In the 2025 season alone, he played 15 games, logging 576 offensive snaps and remaining active in special teams situations. That reliability became a valuable asset for a team pushing toward contention. With his contract set to expire, Jacksonville avoided the risk of free agency by agreeing to a three-year, $51 million extension.According to NFL insider Ian Rapoport, the deal includes $32.5 million in guaranteed compensation and incentives that could increase the total value to $55.5 million.Negotiated by CAA Football’s RJ Gonser and Jim Denton, it represents the largest contract of Van Lanen’s career.After five NFL seasons, his net worth stood at $3.23 million (according to Salary Sport) entering 2026. That figure is expected to increase by at least $10 million almost immediately once the extension takes effect. His average annual salary will now sit at $17 million, with early seasons likely carrying higher payouts.By the end of the deal, Van Lanen’s career earnings could reach $57.5 million, or close to $62 million if incentives are met. As of Week 18, the Jaguars are set to face off against the Tennessee Titans on Sunday, January 4, 2026.Also read: Who is Jacksonville Jaguars owner Shahid Khan?

Elon Musk’s rapid rise: From $24 billion to the brink of trillionaire status









Elon Musk has reached a historical financial milestone, as he has become the first-ever person to ever achieve a net worth that surpasses the whopping figure of $600 billion, as reported in Forbes magazine. This milestone has been achieved during a time when there is newfound interest in his privately owned rocket company, SpaceX, which he believes will make a historical initial start detailing a whopping value of $800 billion with an initial public offering that could potentially take place in 2026.Musk's net worth has not only increased with his involvement with his rocket company, SpaceX, but he has earned a tremendous amount of money with his investment in electric cars with his company, Tesla, where his net worth has increased by a whopping 12% because of his investment in his own artificial intelligence company, xAI.As reported by Forbes, Elon Musk has now broken yet another record by being the first individual to ever reach a net worth of over $600 billion. This achievement has come at a time when his private rocket company, SpaceX, has seen a tremendous rise in market value, with plans of an initial public offering in 2026. Musk's net worth is also contributed by his stake of 12% in Tesla, an electric vehicle behemoth, and his artificial intelligence company, xAI, both of which keep increasing in value.From groundbreaking innovations in space travel and electric mobility to ambitious AI projects, futuristic ventures, and global business expansions, Musk’s diversified portfolio and relentless pursuit of technological advancement have cemented his status as the world’s richest person.SpaceX has also showcased its role in the increasing wealth of Musk to historic levels. With an estimated 42% stake in the firm, the net worth of Musk is expected to grow by an enormous $168 billion if SpaceX continues to retain its current valuation of $800 billion. Analysts also expect it to reach a valuation of $1.5 trillion when it comes to the public market and possibly become the first trillionaire in the world. The innovative nature of SpaceX in terms of its rocket and satellite launches continues to impress the market while affecting the net worth of its CEO.Tesla stock is still an integral part of Musk’s financial network. His current stake of about 12% in Tesla is valued at $197 billion without taking into consideration the stock options from the 2018 CEO Performance Award that are still winding their way through litigation. Apart from that, Tesla shareholders have just approved what is considered the largest compensation deal of $1 trillion that is pegged on meeting various performance goals, including doubling the current market capitalization eightfold in ten years.Musk’s AI company, xAI, is also a significant contributor to his net worth. In the advanced talk of raising funding worth $15 billion in fresh equity, the firm is placed at a value of $230 billion. Musk owns about 53% of the firm’s stakes under xAI Holdings, meaning he has a net worth of about $60 billion. AI is another major sector into which Musk has ventured.Musk's emergence to $600 billion in a short span of time can be noted. He started with $24.6 billion in March 2020 and broke the $100 billion mark later in the same year, and reached $190 billion in January 2021.

Melinda French Gates credits her career to IBM hiring manager





Melinda French Gates is one of the wealthiest women in America but her path to a $17.4 billion fortune began with an unusual advice from hiring manager at IBM . A hiring manager at the US-based multinational technology company told her to turn down the job, and instead join Microsoft that was relatively new at that time. French Gates interned at IBM for two summers, and was on the verge of accepting a full-time position with the company.During the conversation, she told the hiring manager that she had interviewed with a tiny company in Seattle, according to Fortune.“My hiring manager at IBM, a female, said to me, ‘Okay, are you ready to accept the job offer?’ And I said, ‘Well, I have one more company to go interview—this little company, Microsoft. It was tiny,” French Gates said during an interview.“And she said, ‘If they give you an offer, you should take it.’ And it dumbfounded me,” she added.The manager’s reason was clear: She reportedly said that a young recruit would have the better chance to move up quickly at Microsoft as it was growing rapidly.French Gates took the leap and moved to the West Coast in Seattle.“I didn’t know anybody in Seattle. It was moving to the West Coast, but I was so excited about what they were doing.I was like, ‘I want to be part of that,’” she said. French Gates spent nine years at Microsoft and became the General Manager of Information Products. She was a critical architect of the company’s expansion, which is now a $3.6 trillion software titan.Reflecting on her journey, French Gates now uses her story to encourage other women.“I remind them all the time you can pivot careers. You can change. It’s not like one or two paths that carry you forward, even though you had plans before this,” she said.“Here’s this woman who’s supposed to be my manager, giving me a piece of career advice,” French Gates said.",Melinda french gates is one of the wealthiest women in america.

Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu was recently asked by an X (formerly Twitter) user why there is no talk about Arattai now? The user quoted a post stating that Telegram is worth $30 billion with only 30 employees working from home, no office. Responding to the user’s question, Vembu shared that the company is doing “updates weekly” and is working on “some very important features”. “We will market it more once we feel we are satisfied with the feature set!,” Vembu posted, adding “This is a marathon. We are geared for it.”To recall, the Arattai app debuted in 2021 as a rival to Meta’s WhatsApp. Years after its launch, the app recently gained momentum after senior government ministers like Piyush Goyal joined the platform. In September this year, Arattai (meaning chat in Tamil) topped App Store ranking, registering 3,50,000 signs in just three days.Arattai offers familiar features such as:However, the app is still ironing out issues. Users have reported OTP delays, slower contact sync, and call glitches due to server overload.Last month, the company rolled out system-wide end-to-end encryption on the Arattai app. Announcing the release in an X post, Vembu then said that it is a “forced upgrade on all because it is a drastic change”.“We had to do some redesign around it and we wanted extensive testing because it is a drastic change. It is now being tested by about 6,000 people in the company. We identified some issues and have fixed them.

The deal, however, carries geopolitical undertones due to Manus's Chinese origins and subsequent move to Singapore.

Meta's $2.5 billion bet on AI agents signals new era

Chinese roots raise geopolitical concerns despite Singapore move





The co-founder of Manus, the AI startup recently acquired by Meta for $2.5 billion, has drawn parallels between himself and Mark Zuckerberg , highlighting their shared journey as college dropouts who built successful tech companies. Ji Yichao, the 32-year-old chief scientist and co-founder of Manus, shared two photographs on X showing younger versions of himself and Zuckerberg working on laptops in the same room at the ""Facebook House"" in Palo Alto, California. ""21 years ago and 13 years ago, two dropouts in this same room set out on their own journeys. Today, those paths merge,"" Ji wrote following acquisition announcement.According to Chinese media reports, Ji started a computer science degree at Beijing Information Science and Technology University in 2010 but dropped out to pursue entrepreneurship. He later returned to complete his degree in 2018. Zuckerberg famously left Harvard University in 2004 to focus on building Facebook, which eventually became Meta.The deal includes a $500 million retention pool for Manus employees, as Meta ramps up its foray into AI. Manus will be retained as a stand-alone subscription service while weaving in the startup's technology into Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.Manus, which debuted in March 2024 as a ""general-purpose"" AI agent capable of independently conducting deep research and vacation planning, and even coding and stock analysis, reached more than $100 million in annual recurring revenue in less than a year and gained millions of users.That deal is also not without geopolitical nuances, given that Manus was founded by Butterfly Effect in Beijing and Wuhan in 2022. Still, it moved to Singapore in mid-2025, apparently to hedge against geopolitical risk as part of the U.S.–China tech rivalry.Meta says there will be “no continuing Chinese ownership interests in Manus AI” after the acquisition, adding it would wind down services in China. Manus reportedly laid off most of its Chinese staff and now operates with 105 employees across Singapore, Tokyo, and San Francisco.Earlier, Senator John Cornyn had criticised Silicon Valley venture firm Benchmark for its support of Manus, citing fears of American capital underpinning Chinese technology interests.","Meta's $2.5 billion acquisition of ai startup manus sees co-founder ji yichao drawing parallels with mark zuckerberg, both college dropouts who built tech empires.

American billionaire and Shark Tank investor Mark Cuban has revealed that he avoids phone calls altogether. As reported by Fortune, in a TikTok video posted by Masterclass, Cuban said, “No, I don’t do calls. You know, I’ll engage with you via email, and trust me, I do this all the time. I’m really good at it.” He further explained that emails enable him to craft a more thoughtful responses and also helps him in preventing from forgetting details midst his bust schedule. “I’ll give you more comprehensive responses than if it was via phone,” he noted, adding that emails also provide a searchable record of conversations.Cuban’s stance echoes a broader generational trend. Many Gen Zers prefer email or text over calls, but for different reasons. A 2024 study found nearly a quarter of the generation avoids answering phone calls entirely, often due to telephobia — a form of phone anxiety that can trigger physical symptoms such as nausea, shaking, and difficulty concentrating.Talking to Business Insider, Billionaire Mark Cuban revealed that his daily routine is not at all exciting rather it’s quite boring. “I read and respond to emails,"" he wrote in an email.""I work out. I read and respond to emails. I do a couple Zooms. Then I read and respond to emails. Then I eat dinner. Then I read and respond to emails,” Cuban told BI.He revealed that his day starts with a decaf coffee and a cookie. He then takes her daughter to school and after that he works out at Life Time Fitness. Once done with the fitness regimen he again dives into his inbox. Despite his wealth, Cuban refuses to hire an assistant to manage his email, saying it would only “slow things down.”“I receive around 700 emails a day and use three phones (two Android and one iPhone) to manage everything. I'd rather get 700 to 1,000 emails than sit in long, boring meetings,” Cuban told BI.He emphasised that emails work for him because they come with searchable history. He also use Gmail’s auto-replies for 10–20% of messages. Cuban also mentioned that that in order to stay focused he keeps the unread emails under 20.Cuban rarely disconnects from email—even on vacation. “It’s faster to just get it out of the way,” he said. Only family events or emergencies prompt him to step away from his inbox for more than a few hours.While some may find his routine monotonous, Cuban sees it as a strategic advantage.","Billionaire mark cuban reveals his daily routine in a tiktok video posted by masterclass. “i read and respond to emails,"" he wrote in an email.

The company faces lawsuits over alleged harm caused by ChatGPT, while its safety teams have been disbanded. This new role aims to balance rapid AI advancement with crucial safeguards, a challenging task given the technology's unprecedented capabilities and potential dangers.

OpenAI's Master Plan for India

Safety teams keep vanishing as products multiply

Lawsuits paint darker picture of AI's mental health toll





The man who unleashed ChatGPT on the world is now sounding the alarm about his own creation. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is hunting for a Head of Preparedness to tackle what he calls ""real challenges"" emerging from AI systems that have grown so sophisticated they're finding critical security vulnerabilities and impacting users' mental health. The $555,000 role comes as the company that revolutionised generative AI in late 2022 grapples with lawsuits, safety team departures, and the uncomfortable reality that its technology may be causing genuine harm.""Models are improving quickly and are now capable of many great things, but they are also starting to present some real challenges,"" Altman wrote on X. He didn't sugarcoat the position's demands, warning applicants: ""This will be a stressful job and you'll jump into the deep end pretty much immediately.""The new hire will lead OpenAI's preparedness framework, evaluating frontier AI capabilities and coordinating safeguards across cybersecurity, biosecurity, and the prospect of AI systems that can improve themselves—challenges that Altman admits have ""little precedent."" The company specifically needs help figuring out ""how to enable cybersecurity defenders with cutting edge capabilities while ensuring attackers can't use them for harm.The job opening arrives amid a disturbing pattern at OpenAI: safety teams appear, then disappear. The company's Superalignment team, launched in 2023 with the mission of preventing AI systems ""much smarter than us"" from going rogue, lasted less than a year before being disbanded in May 2024. Co-leader Jan Leike quit with a blistering exit statement, declaring that ""safety culture and processes have taken a backseat to shiny products. ""The AGI Readiness team met a similar fate in October 2024, dissolved after advising on the company's preparedness for artificial general intelligence. Meanwhile, Aleksander Madry, OpenAI's previous Head of Preparedness, was reassigned in July 2024 to work on AI reasoning instead—leaving the crucial safety position vacant for months even as the technology advanced.The urgency behind the new position becomes clearer when examining the lawsuits piling up against OpenAI. Multiple families allege ChatGPT reinforced delusions, deepened isolation, and even encouraged suicide. One case involves a 16-year-old California boy; another centers on a 56-year-old Connecticut man who allegedly murdered his mother and killed himself after interactions with the chatbot that fueled his paranoid delusions.OpenAI says it's working to improve ChatGPT's ability to ""recognize and respond to signs of mental or emotional distress,"" but the company hasn't slowed its product velocity. Despite Altman's 2023 signing of a letter warning that AI extinction risks deserve priority alongside ""pandemics and nuclear war,"" OpenAI keeps accelerating. The company, now valued at $157 billion after October's $6.6 billion funding round, is reportedly negotiating with Amazon for another investment exceeding $10 billion.That contradiction—tech leaders prophesying catastrophe while racing to build the very technology they fear—hasn't gone unnoticed. ""If they honestly believe this could bring about human extinction, then why not just stop?"" asked one critic after Altman's Congressional testimony. The new Head of Preparedness will inherit that impossible balancing act: making AI safer while the company that employs them pushes relentlessly forward.","Openai's sam altman seeks a high-stakes 'head of preparedness' to address ai's growing security risks and mental health impacts.

Speaking to LinkedIn CEO Ryan Roslansky in 2023, Nadella revealed that as a teenage in Hyderabad his ambition revolved around cricket and banking. He said that he never thought of software.

Yet, he later reflected that not getting in forced him to explore other opportunities ones that ultimately shaped his resilience and adaptability.After getting rejected from IIT, Nadella got enrolled at the Manipal Institute of Technology, where he studied electrical engineering. The decision of taking admission in Manipal Institute of Technology set him on a trajectory that would take him to the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee for a master’s degree.After completing his masters he enrolled in the University of Chicago for an MBA.Nadella also recalled that after reaching the US he faced cultural shocks, homesickness and the challenge of proving himself in a new country. He said that he often joked about the fact that he simply cannot locate Milwaukee on a map before moving there.

Apple may skip iPhone 18 launch in 2026: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-may-skip-iphone-18-launch-in-2026-report/articleshow/126298730.cms,"Apple's Foldable iPhone is Coming, Here’s Why it Matters

Why iPhone 18 may not launch in 2026





Apple iPhone 18 standard model may not launch this year, says a new report by MacRumours. Other models under the iPhone 18 series – iPhone 18 Pro and iPhone 18 Pro Max are likely to have the usual launch timeline and are expected to come in September 2026. As per the report, the Cupertino-based company may unveil its first foldable ‌iPhone‌ during the fall event.“For more than a decade, Apple has introduced its mainline ‌iPhone‌ lineup in the fall, with all core models launching simultaneously in September,” MacRumors reported. “That pattern is expected to change this year, when the company is widely rumored to split its upcoming ‌iPhone‌ releases across two distinct release windows rather than unveiling the entire lineup at once. Under this strategy, Apple is expected to prioritize higher-end models in the fall while delaying lower-cost or standard models until the following year,” the report says.According to the report, iPhone 18 may not arrive until the spring of 2027, leaving the ‌iPhone 17‌ “as the latest standard model for over 18 months.” To recall, iPhone 17 debuted in September 2025 along with other iPhone 17 series models. “This would mark the first time Apple skips an entire calendar year without releasing a new generation of its flagship non-Pro ‌iPhone‌,” it says.MacRumours says that the rumoured change is likely due to Apple’s expanding iPhone lineup. Apple introduced iPhone 16e and iPhone Air last year. The company is rumoured to bring its first foldable iPhone in 2026. With the continued presence of iPhone 16 and 16 Plus, there could be at least eight iPhone models on sale by the end of 2026 (considering Apple’s next iPhone lineup continues to include – iPhone 18 Pro, iPhone 18 Pro Max and iPhone 18).“A staggered release schedule would allow the company to further differentiate its models, give them a longer sales window without internal competition, and spread ‌iPhone‌ launches more evenly across the year,” the report says.According to supply chain analysts, the rumoured shift will also result in manufacturing and logistics benefits for the iPhone maker. “By spacing out launches, Apple could reduce production bottlenecks, better manage component supply for advanced technologies, and smooth revenue recognition across fiscal quarters rather than concentrating ‌iPhone‌ sales in a single period,” the report adds.","Apple iphone 18 standard model may not launch this year, says a new report by macrumours.

“Billionaire Alexandr Wang says he wants to wait to have kids until Neuralink is very advanced, because children’s brains in the first seven years are more flexible and can learn brain-computer interfaces, unlocking more potential than adult brains

Speaking on a podcast, Wang explained that he wants to wait until Neuralink or similar BCI technology is reliable and widely available. His reasoning is that children born into such a world could integrate the technology directly into their developing brains, rather than having to adapt to it later in life

He pointed to neuroplasticity, the brain’s heightened ability to form neural connections in early childhood, arguing that during the first ~7 years, children could learn to use brain-computer interfaces in ways adults simply cannot.

""I think with plasticity, you're talking, in general, you're talking about the entire brain. You're talking about altering a trillion synapses all in a similar way,"" he said.

At a deeper level, Wang’s comments reflect a broader concern: artificial intelligence is advancing at an exponential pace, while human biological evolution is slow. He suggests that direct neural links to AI may eventually be necessary for humans to remain cognitively competitive in a future shaped by superintelligence.”

“It's never an easy decision to say goodbye to colleagues. These are talented people who have worked extremely hard and contributed to our Al effort. Anyone in North America whose role was impacted has already been notified. Those who may be impacted in EMEA have been notified and remain subject to consultation,” Wang said.

“This by no means signals any decrease in investment. In fact, we will continue to hire industry-leading Al-native talent. Our goal is to enable MSL to move faster. We remain excited about the models we are training, our ambitious compute plans, and the products we are building, and I'm confident in our path to superintelligence,” he added.





Alexandr Wang, the head of Meta’s artificial intelligence division — SuperIntelligence Labs has now given a new statement on his plans of having kids. Speaking at The Shawn Rayan Show, Wang said that he wait until Elon Musk ’s Neuralink or similar brain‑computer interface (BCI) technology is highly advanced before having children. Wang is of the opinion that child neuroplasticity offers the best window for adopting brain‑computer interfaces, and that future generations could grow up learning to use superintelligence tools intuitively. “I’ll have kids after Neuralink is very advanced, because children’s brains in the first seven years are more flexible and can learn brain-computer interfaces, unlocking more potential than adult brains,” said Wang.Tesla CEO Elon Musk founded Neuralink is presently conducting clinical trials and is working at restoring mobility for patients with paralysis. Musk has long promoted the idea of expanding the technology to enhance human cognition. Wang’s remarks highlight how some tech leaders see BCIs not just as medical tools, but as essential upgrades for future generations.Meta Superintelligence Lab (MSL), the billion-dollar team that Mark Zuckerberg created to take on Google and OpenAI in artificial intelligence (AI), is hiring.

People entering a house party might expect to see a rack overflowing with shoes by the door. Lately, people entering some startup offices in the US might, too. The “no shoes” trend is spreading in tech offices, with buzzy startups telling employees to leave their Vans and Uggs at the door. Some cover their offices with soft rugs, or offer free slippers. The website noshoes.fun, by Ben Lang, an employee at the shoes-off startup Cursor, lists a dozen-plus startups with such an approach, including several artificial intelligence firms like Replo and Composite.“I’ve only worked at startups that have a no-shoes in office policy,” Lang said on social media in Aug.Workers at Spur, which uses AI to check websites for bugs, don branded slides upon arrival at their office in Manhattan, and guests are asked to do the same, said Sneha Sivakumar, a co-founder and the CEO.
