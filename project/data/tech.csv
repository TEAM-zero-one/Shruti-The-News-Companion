The second weekend of Battlefield 6 open beta is live now. As revealed earlier, this phase has included a lot of new features in the beta version, in terms of modes, maps, and challenges. That is why fans of different platforms need to update their games in order to play the second phase of the beta.The first phase racked up a staggering player-base of over 500k players. With the new update coming in the second phase, it seems the old record is going to be broken this time.Battlefield 6 open beta second weekend has gone live a few hours ago. So, many players have already jumped into it and updated it. But those who haven’t yet updated it might wonder how much more they will need to download.For the PC players, updating Battlefield 6 beta might be a bit of a headache because it will take 3.1 GB and 4.1 GB of update sizes via Steam and the EA App respectively. However, for console users, updating BF6 won’t be an issue at all because Xbox players will need to download a 547 MB update, whereas for PlayStation players, it’s just 380 MB.The week 2 update of Battlefield 6 open beta is the same game version as it was in week 1.However, the code and data are different in two weeks of the open beta. Not only that, the second weekend has come up with a lot of brand new features, so the open beta version was bound to get an update.This update has also probably fixed a lot of persisting bugs and glitches which were seen in the game in the previous week. There was a bug which was resisting players from Battlefield 6 if they installed Valorant in their systems. Hopefully, this bug has been fixed as well.Apart from bug fixes, the second weekend of Battlefield 6 open beta has featured a new map called Empire State, which has joined the pool with the other three pre-existing maps. Along with it, the long-waited Rush mode is back in the Battlefield franchise, with other new modes like Squad Deathmatch, and many more.Battlefield 6 open beta second weekend has begun on August 14, 2025 and will run until August 17 at 4 AM ET.","The second weekend of battlefield 6 open beta is live now.

Connor McDavid ’s next contract could be game-changer, says Insider

What’s at stake for Oilers and NHL in Connor McDavid’s contract talks



Connor McDavid FULL Year-End Press Conference

The future of Edmonton Oilers captain Connor McDavid is the NHL’s hottest offseason storyline. As the 2025-26 season approaches, the superstar forward remains undecided on a contract extension, keeping fans, management, and rivals guessing. Now, fresh insider reports suggest his next deal could set a new benchmark in hockey history — worth as much as $17.5 million per year.NHL insider Frank Seravalli believes McDavid’s next contract could fall in the $16–$17.5 million range annually, with a four-year term emerging as the most likely scenario. “This is a pure spitball; I believe it will be somewhere between $16-17.5 million a year on a four-year deal,” Seravalli said, as reported by NHL Rumors and Bleacher Report.McDavid, 28, is entering the final season of the eight-year, $100 million deal he signed in 2017. Eligible to sign an extension since July 1, the Oilers’ captain has yet to commit, sparking widespread speculation about his long-term plans.Daily Faceoff’s Jason Gregor expects McDavid to eventually re-sign, predicting a five-year agreement with an Average Annual Value (AAV) between $15.5 and $16 million. If finalized, the deal would make McDavid the NHL’s highest-paid player when it takes effect in the 2026–27 season, eclipsing current salary records.Drafted first overall in 2015, McDavid has been the driving force behind Edmonton’s return to Stanley Cup contention, leading them to the Final in recent seasons. His unmatched speed, playmaking, and leadership have made him the face of the franchise and one of the most marketable athletes in the sport.The Oilers’ management has adopted a patient stance, giving McDavid full control over the timing of negotiations. However, the lack of an extension has inevitably stirred trade chatter.Also Read: Connor McDavid turns water baby as wife Lauren shares candid poolside snap ahead of Leon Draisaitl and Celeste Desjardins’ wedding McDavid’s projected $16–$17.5 million AAV would surpass the current NHL salary record, forcing the Oilers to rework their cap strategy while setting a new benchmark that could drive up contract values for other top-tier players across the league.","Edmonton oilers captain connor mcdavid is yet to sign a contract extension.

Xbox servers came across with severe outages today

Xbox has recently faced some serious server outages today. Although the situation has been handled by the company pretty well, but major Xbox services were heavily affected. This is the first major server blackout after more than a year, when the whole Xbox Live feature became inaccessible.The proper reason for this server outage hasn’t yet been revealed by Xbox yet, but it’s good to see that the servers have become live very soon after the outbreaks. Let’s explore in detail about this major issue in the Xbox camp.Today, on August 14, 2025, many Xbox users have reported that the servers of this popular console had been going through major outages. The majority of the console features which were affected by this outage was associated with Party Management, viewing and sending messages to friends, sending and receiving game invites, and others. The server blackouts even went beyond current gen consoles, affecting the likes of Xbox One, Xbox 360, and Xbox on PC.However, the official Twitter handle of Xbox Support quickly looked into the situation and assured that the engineers were about to fix those issues, and eventually they did fix the server outage issues very soon. The good thing was, playing or streaming multiplayer matches via Xbox Game Pass and Xbox Store purchases were unaffected, so the whole gameplay experience wasn’t disrupted at all.Still, many fans were disgusted as today the second weekend of Battlefield 6 open beta kicked off . So, major Party Management problems obviously created nuisance in communication while playing that game. However, as the issue is now fixed, fans can play BF6 open beta now without any hassle until August 17.Despite imposing a quick fix, Xbox didn’t go in detail about the specific reason behind this server outage. But it’s believed that whatever may be the reason, is nothing huge to worry about as it was not any kind of security breach or data leak.","Today, on august 14, 2025, many xbox users have reported that the servers of this popular console had been going through major outages.

Sundar Pichai responds to a co-founder’s request by adding a quick event duplication shortcut to Google Calendar; duplicate meetings instantly,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/sundar-pichai-responds-to-a-co-founders-request-by-adding-a-quick-event-duplication-shortcut-to-google-calendar-duplicate-meetings-instantly/articleshow/123301035.cms,"Source: BBC

How John Collison small request for Google Calendar sparked an update



Google Calendar event duplication shortcut: How it works



Key advantages include:

Faster scheduling: Duplicate events without opening multiple menus.

Reduced clicks: Previously, users had to navigate through the three-dot menu to duplicate events—a multi-step process.

Improved productivity: Perfect for busy professionals managing multiple meetings or recurring events, saving time and minimizing scheduling errors effectively.

Current limitations of the Google calendar new update feature



Not available in all views: Users in Schedule or Year view cannot use the drag-and-duplicate feature.

Works only in movable views: The shortcut functions only where events can be dragged or resized directly.

Despite these constraints, the feature saves users valuable time and reduces friction in scheduling tasks.

Google Calendar Shortcut sparks social media buzz as Sundar Pichai responds



Google Calendar shortcut significance for Google Calendar users

A light-hearted exchange on social media between leading tech figures has resulted in a practical update for Google Calendar. Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google, confirmed that the platform now includes a quick event duplication feature, following a suggestion by Stripe co-founder John Collison just over a month ago. Collison had proposed a Ctrl-click shortcut to instantly copy meetings, similar to features in other calendar tools like Microsoft Outlook. The new functionality allows users to duplicate events by holding Ctrl (or Cmd on Mac) and dragging them in Day, Week, or Month view, eliminating multiple steps previously required. This small but impactful update enhances scheduling efficiency, making recurring or similar appointments faster and more convenient for Google Calendar users.On July 5, John Collison took to X (formerly Twitter) with a simple request for Google Calendar. He asked whether the platform could introduce a shortcut to copy events, similar to features available in Microsoft Outlook and other popular calendar tools. Collison suggested a Ctrl-click function that would instantly duplicate meetings or appointments and tagged Sundar Pichai, ensuring the idea reached the right decision-makers at Google.Unlike most social media requests that disappear into the noise, this one stood out. Pichai responded in kind, announcing that the feature had been implemented in Google Calendar’s web version.The new shortcut allows users to hold Ctrl (or Cmd on Mac) and drag an event to another time slot within Day, Week, or Month view, instantly creating a copy.This shortcut makes event duplication in Google Calendar intuitive and efficient, reflecting Google’s focus on enhancing user experience.While the update improves workflow, it’s important to note some limitations:Collison’s suggestion quickly became a talking point on X. Other tech figures joined the conversation, adding a mix of humor and curiosity. Box CEO Aaron Levie jokingly suggested leveraging influence to improve Waymo’s self-driving cars on a congested Silicon Valley route.For everyday Google Calendar users, the shortcut may seem minor but adds tangible convenience, making repetitive scheduling tasks faster and more intuitive. The incident highlights Sundar Pichai’s hands-on approach to social media engagement. Users praised his responsiveness:“Sundar Pichai is out here doing customer service. I love it.”“Hi Sundar, can we log out of one Gmail account at a time instead of all accounts at once?”Pichai’s interactions are consistent with past instances. Earlier in 2025, he responded to Quora CEO Adam D’Angelo about Google Meet audio issues, showing Google’s commitment to addressing user feedback promptly.Even though event duplication in Google Calendar may seem like a small feature, it reflects a larger trend: Google is listening to user feedback and rapidly implementing improvements. By allowing quick duplication of meetings, the platform enhances workflow efficiency and provides users with a smoother scheduling experience.Professionals, teams, and casual users alike benefit from this shortcut, which reduces unnecessary clicks, saves time, and simplifies calendar management.","A light-hearted exchange on social media between leading tech figures has resulted in a practical update for google calendar.

Why the Blackhawks make sense as a landing spot for Carey Price's contract

What Montreal gains — and the steep price they’d pay



The Montreal Canadiens could finally be on the verge of moving Carey Price’s massive contract — and the Chicago Blackhawks might be the team to make it happen. With Price’s deal entering its final year and carrying a $10.5 million cap hit, a proposed trade scenario has emerged that could benefit both sides while reshaping their near-term plans.The Blackhawks currently sit just over $6 million above the salary cap floor and are expected to move several veterans by the trade deadline. Taking on Price’s contract would give them a financial cushion and strategic flexibility. Analyst Tab Bamford suggests a swap in which Chicago would receive Price’s contract, along with Montreal’s 2026 and 2027 first-round picks, in exchange for goaltender Laurent Brossoit, forward Lukas Reichel, and three second-round picks spread across 2026 and 2027.For Chicago, the move would create a stockpile of draft capital — including three first-rounders in 2026 — giving them “enough ammo to do something significant” in the future. And if the Hawks decide to make a big splash in free agency, Price’s and Shea Weber’s contracts could be placed on LTIR, unlocking more than $18 million in extra cap space.From Montreal’s perspective, adding Brossoit would address a current depth issue behind starter Samuel Montembeault.As Bamford bluntly put it, “Right now, their backup is Kaapo Kahkonen — who is not good.” Brossoit’s career .911 save percentage (.927 last season with Winnipeg) and Stanley Cup-winning experience with Vegas in 2023 make him an immediate upgrade.Reichel, meanwhile, is a 23-year-old former first-round pick who hasn’t found his stride in Chicago. A fresh start in Montreal could unlock his potential, especially in a system eager to develop young forwards.The challenge for the Canadiens would be the heavy draft pick sacrifice — having already moved both 2025 first-rounders in the Noah Dobson trade, losing their ’26 and ’27 selections would test their long-term asset management.Also Read: NHL Trade Rumors: Connor McDavid linked to Maple Leafs and $3.5B Rangers if Oilers extension talks stall Still, if Montreal believes Brossoit and Reichel can contribute immediately, and if shedding Price’s cap hit accelerates their rebuild, this could be the kind of high-risk, high-reward move that changes their trajectory.",The montreal canadiens could finally be on the verge of moving carey price’s massive contract.

Igor Babuschkin , a leading artificial intelligence researcher and one of the founding members of Elon Musk ’s AI startup xAI , has officially announced his departure to launch a new venture focused on AI safety research and responsible innovation. Babuschkin played a pivotal role in shaping xAI’s technical infrastructure, building engineering teams, and overseeing the development of its Grok chatbot.On August 13, 2025, Babuschkin announced his resignation, writing on X: “Today was my last day at xAI, the company that I helped start with Elon Musk in 2023… Building AI that advances humanity has been my lifelong dream.” Elon Musk replied publicly, “Best of luck, Igor,” a cordial farewell that contrasted with Musk’s often tense relationships with departing executives. With his new firm, Babuschkin Ventures , he aims to fund research and startups developing AI systems that advance humanity while ensuring the technology’s safe and ethical deployment in an increasingly competitive global AI landscape.While Babuschkin has kept much of his personal life private, his career trajectory reflects a consistent passion for advanced machine learning systems and the ethical use of technology. He studied computer science and artificial intelligence, developing a strong foundation in deep learning, neural networks, and natural language processing before entering the tech industry’s most competitive AI labs.As reported by Reuters, Babuschkin’s AI journey began at Google DeepMind, one of the world’s most prestigious research labs known for breakthroughs in AlphaGo and protein-folding prediction. As a research engineer, he contributed to projects pushing the boundaries of reinforcement learning and large language models.Later, he joined OpenAI, working on technical infrastructure that powered the organization’s advanced AI models. This experience exposed him to both the incredible potential and serious risks of powerful AI systems — insights that would later shape his philosophy at xAI and beyond.In 2023, Babuschkin became a founding member of xAI, a company Musk envisioned as a transparent and mission-driven alternative to Big Tech AI platforms.

Starting August 18, 2025, UAE citizens will be allowed to renew their passports up to one year before the expiry date, a change from the earlier six-month window. The new rule, issued by the ICP, is part of a broader initiative to enhance travel flexibility, streamline official procedures, and strengthen the UAE passport’s global standing.The Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Ports Security (ICP) has revised the policy governing passport renewals for UAE citizens. As per the latest decision by Ali Mohammed Al Shamsi, Chairman of the ICP, Emiratis will now be permitted to renew their passports once the remaining validity is one year or less. This is a shift from the previous rule that allowed renewals only when six months or fewer were left before expiration.The change will be effective Monday, August 18, 2025, and is applicable to all UAE nationals with eligible passports.

Additionally, UAE nationals living abroad can submit their applications through UAE embassies and consulates, and they also have the option to initiate the process online and collect the renewed passport from a diplomatic mission.This update comes at a time when the UAE passport continues to see a significant rise in its global ranking and travel privileges. As of 2025, the UAE passport:This is a marked improvement over previous years:Since the Henley Passport Index’s inception in 2006, the UAE passport has added 152 countries to its visa-free or visa-on-arrival list, reflecting the UAE's growing diplomatic ties and international mobility for its citizens.Chairman Al Shamsi highlighted that the UAE passport continues to rank as the world’s most powerful, trusted, and widely recognised travel document. The new decision, he added, is a strong boost to its global standing and further establishes the UAE’s passport issuance and renewal system as a leading model for the region and beyond.In terms of operations, the General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs in Dubai has processed 7,425 passport renewals during the first half of 2025 alone. Since the opening of its center in 2008, over 139,000 passports have been issued to Emiratis through that facility.","Uae passport now grants visa-free or visa-on-arrival access to 185 countries, ranking it 8th strongest worldwide in 2025.

Independence Day 2025: Zomato announces free delivery on these orders,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/independence-day-2025-zomato-announces-free-delivery-on-these-orders/articleshow/123315945.cms,"Independence Day celebrations are underway across the country. Food delivery platform Zomato has kicked in the celebrations by announcing free delivery on select orders. As revealed by the company and now live on Zomato app, Gold members will get free delivery on orders above Rs 99, which was earlier Rs 199. In addition, Zomato Gold membership is available for Re 1. Zomato’s Independence Day offer is live from August 14 to 17.“By lowering the free delivery threshold for our Zomato Gold members, we aim to make online ordering more rewarding—encouraging customers to enjoy everyday meals while discovering more restaurants,” Aditya Mangla, chief executive of food delivery business Eternal told Economic times.“This change not only offers greater value to our Gold members but also supports our restaurant partners during this important time of year,” he added.Earlier this month, Zomato CEO Deepinder Goyal urged India to embrace its potential and become a global superpower following US tariff hikes. His call for self-reliance and ambition resonated widely, sparking discussions on economic reforms and strategic independence. The focus shifted towards strengthening local manufacturing, improving trade policies, and leveraging underutilized sectors like tourism to reduce reliance on external forces.In his statement, Goyal noted that such global ""reminders"" happen regularly — “a threat here, a tariff there” — all reinforcing the idea that India should ""stay in its lane."" But instead of reacting with resentment, he urged Indians to respond with ambition. He argued that the only path forward is for India to unapologetically become the largest superpower, not only economically, but also in defense, technology, and self-belief.The sentiment resonated widely, sparking a wave of support across X. One user commented, “It’s not about retaliation, it’s about evolution.” Another said, “We’ve been modest for too long. It’s time to lead.” Goyal’s post was hailed for framing ambition itself as a strategic imperative, an economic philosophy rooted not in dependence or appeasement, but in self-determination.","Zomato gold members will get free delivery on orders above rs 99, which was earlier rs 199.

"China push: In Nepal, EVs now account for 76% of all vehicles sold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/china-push-in-nepal-evs-now-account-for-76-of-all-vehicles-sold/articleshow/122960428.cms,"



KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Ev market share in nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including norway, singapore and ethiopia.

Four men in Northampton, England, raced away from an Indian restaurant without paying their 200-pound (about Rs 21,000) bill, which led to a spectacular chase by the staff. According to a Daily Mail article, the event took place in the Saffron restaurant at around 10.11 pm on August 4.Men can be seen entering the restaurant in the widely circulated CCTV footage posted on Instagram. Later in the video, they can be seen rushing out of the restaurant's door after leaving their table. When they reveal their intent, a staff member may be seen pursuing them.

The bill breakdown included four plain poppadoms for £5.60, one chutney tray for £2.20, two chargrilled lamb chops for £24.00, three chicken chat dishes for £30.00, two chicken tikka mains for £28.00, two chicken tikka masalas for £32.00, two boiled rice portions for £11.00, two garlic naans for £12.00, three chapatis for £12.00, one serving of chips for £4.50, and nine 330 ml glass bottles of Coke for £36.00.Police in Northamptonshire acknowledged that they are looking into the event as a possible theft.""This kind of behavior isn't just theft; it affects hardworking small businesses and our local community,"" they wrote in a Facebook post.Online, the post generated a range of responses. ""Eat at home if you can't afford it! One user asked, ""Why are people these days so lazy to cook?""“This is why you swipe a card before they’re seated.

Poll Do you think it's fair for authorities to allow loud music while preventing others from performing? Yes, it's unfair No, they should enforce rules equally





A Canadian man stirred debate online after criticising an Indian family for playing loud Punjabi music at a beach in Barrie, Ontario.In the video, shared on Instagram, the man- who goes by @truenorthlooper- described himself as a one-man band and said city authorities had once stopped him from performing at the beach and fined him.He alleged the same authorities now allow others to “blast whatever kind of music they want.”While speaking, he stopped in front of a picnic blanket with bags and a speaker playing Punjabi music. “This is another example of coming down to the beach and blasting whatever kind of music you want and at whatever volume you want. These people are not even here, yet everyone within 150 feet has to listen to this. Great job, City of Barrie,” he said sarcastically.He continued by criticising the authorities for penalising him for playing guitar. “Heaven forbid, I play guitar and raise money for the Barrie Food Bank. That’s a no-no. But yeah, come here and blast whatever music you want, you don’t even have to listen to it, go play in the water while everyone else will have to listen to it,” he added.The video, originally titled “The good, the bad and the ugly reality of the City of Barrie,” resurfaced after being shared by a Canadian Instagram page.The post drew mixed reactions in the comments. Some supported him, writing, “Common courtesy and space for others used to be a thing. I think the due is on point for not disturbing others peace and doing things considering ppl around you.”Another commented, “Welcome to Canada, where immigrants get it all and Canadians with roots are the problem.

H-1B cap cases denied because of digital signatures?

What's creating the confusion?



Steps to avoid rejections



A valid signature must be handwritten by the signatory.

A A photocopy or scanned copy of a document containing an original ink signature is acceptable, as long as the original document was physically signed.

Signatures created by a typewriter, word processor, auto-pen, or pasted as images do not satisfy the requirement.

USCIS does not provide an opportunity to cure or correct a deficient signature once filed leading to outright denial of such petitions.





Some immigration law offices that deal with H-1B petitions have raised an alert that they are seeing denials of benefit requests over the validity of signatures. The US Citizenship and Immigration Services intensified their scrutiny of signature compliance in H-1B petitions, they said, which led to a growing number of Notices of Intent to Deny (NOIDs). Going by the rule, all signatures on Form I-129 forms must be valid handwritten signatures and not electronically inserted or duplicated.During the Covid-19 pandemic, the USCIS allowed electronically reproduced signatures but now they are canceling forms that do not have handwritten inked signatures or a valid reproduction of the original.""In recent adjudications, USCIS identified multiple I-129 petitions in which all required signatures appeared identical across pages, suggesting the use of a scanned image or digital copy. USCIS emphasized that such uniformity is inconsistent with the natural variation of genuine ink signatures and determined these signatures were not compliant with applicable regulations and instructions. The agency concluded that the petitions had not been properly signed and therefore could not be adjudicated favorably,"" Law office of Thomas V Allen said.The law office said that in one case, the USCIS noted that all three signatures required on Form I-129 were identical, indicating that it was a digital signature. In another case, USCIS rejected newly submitted signature pages where the ink signatures did not match or could not be verified as originating from the original submission.","Several cases of h-1b petition being denied were reported because of digital signatures.
