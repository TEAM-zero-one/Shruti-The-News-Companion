The wishlist: What comes next for India?

“Ecstatic! Hell yeah, I’ve been waiting for this all my life.” Linkin Park fan Joel’s words almost encapsulate the emotions of all the Indian millennials and Gen Zs who have been waiting to see the iconic rock band live.“They've been with me from my tiny MP3 player to my current smartphone,” he adds.“They have ruled all my yearly music wraps. Seeing them perform live is a dream come true for all nu metal fans,” says Saurav Kumar, who has been a fan since 2007.The year 2026 is packed with events and shows that bring the musical soul of fans to life. The rock septet is also set to perform at Lollapalooza 2026, which is also supercharged with other headliners like Playboi Carti, Fuji Kaze, and many more artists on the lineup.Legendary performers like The Lumineers and John Mayer will be setting their solo stages for the Indian fans this year too.What’s exciting is that these events talk about the musical schedule for just two months into the year.Keeping 2025 in hindsight, the year that set the stage for global superstars like Coldplay, Ed Sheeran, Travis Scott, Akon and many more in the Indian soil, it is only left to our imagination what the rest of 2026 holds.This only goes to show that India is no longer an afterthought for the global artist tour venues, but a very significant stop.Or as Naman Pugalia, the chief business officer for live events at BookMyShow, puts it, “India is no longer a wildcard on the touring circuit but a permanent hotspot.”India has rapidly moved to become a primary market for major international music artists when weighing their tour route. In 2017, when Justin Bieber announced India as his stop, the Beliebers had a meltdown.Hosting international stars has not been a new thing for India.In 1996, the King of Pop, Michael Jackson, performed in Mumbai. However, the event was very much driven by novelty or an elite audience. But the landscape is shifting swiftly, and the change is driven by both the global promoters and a homegrown audience ready to show up for the live experience in sizable numbers.Naman Pugalia says, “India has become one of the fastest-growing live entertainment markets globally, with a population of 1.4 billion and a rapidly expanding base of global music fans.”And the excitement is palpable, putting in perspective the enthusiasm and active participation of the audience who are ready to cross borders, quite literally, just to see their favourite artists live.Swadha Shankar, who travelled all the way to Ahmedabad from Delhi, shares, “Watching the artists, who filled the silence of your early life with ambition and music that shaped your personality, keeps the flame of passion burning within you.”“Concerts offer collective energy. Music creates a shared experience beyond cities and cultures,” says Gursshheen Gahllen, who most recently attended the Akon concert in Delhi.However, it is not only passion driving the genre, but India has also rapidly developed its infrastructure and management capabilities, which have strengthened the logistical backbone of these live experiences promised to the crowd and have gained more credibility in the eyes of international headliners.Pugalia shares the importance of ever-evolving production standards, which ultimately shape the entertainment ecosystem for these events.“As a rapidly growing economy, India has been a prime hotspot for international artists to connect with an abundantly populous fan community. With the ever-evolving infrastructure for concerts, festivals and live entertainment shows in the country, artists are now joining the bandwagon to woo passionate Indian fans.”India stood the test of quality in front of major touring acts.Coldplay, during their India stop in 2025, added more dates to accommodate the high demand, with each show being a sell-out. Ed Sheeran’s revisit to India also reaffirmed the stance that India can move tickets at global scale.The buzz in India today is unignorable — and it’s not just audiences feeling it. It’s drawing artists to embrace their roots.Tyla’s Mumbai show was a case in point. With Indian lineage in her family, she stepped out not only as a global artist but as someone reclaiming a piece of heritage. She wore a bindi, spoke to the crowd, and the arena erupted.It is not only the passion that is driving the young crowd to these musical gatherings. Logistically, accessibility and awareness have shaped the fulfilment of their interests on a great scale.Affluent millennials, typically aged between 25 and 40 with rising disposable incomes, form the core audience for these concerts. They are willing to stay updated, buy tickets and get onboard with the firsthand experience of witnessing it all live.“When my friends first asked me to join them for a concert in 2022, I got very curious. ‘What could be the difference between streaming on a phone and seeing them live?’” says Mohammad Sarim, “And since then, I have attended more than 15 concerts by different artists.”Music fans are no longer passive consumers through online platforms; they are very inclined to follow artist journeys and travel to cities for shows. This contributes significantly towards boosting an economy that can cater to the quality demands of hosting these global stars.“35% of Coldplay’s audience in Ahmedabad came from non-metro cities, underlining the fact that demand extends far beyond traditional urban hubs,” said Naman Pugalia when asked about the shift in Indian audience towards the live experience.This is not only driving ticket sales, but the travel pattern is shaping a new “concert tourism” market.“We travelled in a luxury sleeper bus from Delhi to Ahmedabad. A friend joining from Mumbai through his connections was able to arrange lavish rooms when Ahmedabad was out of rooms,” Swadha shares about her travel and accommodation.This movement of fans across states has turned concerts into economic events that extend beyond ticket sales, benefiting airlines, hotels, transport services, food outlets and local vendors.According to the EY–Parthenon and BookMyShow report, India’s Rising Concert Economy, India’s organised live events segment crossed Rs 12,000 crore in 2024 and is projected to grow at around 18–19% annually over the next few years.The broader media and entertainment sector crossed Rs 2.5 trillion in 2024, with live events among its fastest-growing segments, according to the FICCI–EY Media & Entertainment Report.Ticketing data also shows Tier-II cities now contribute close to 35–38% of demand, reflecting a sharp expansion beyond metros.For global artists, India’s scale compensates for relatively lower ticket pricing. Volume over price has become the Indian formula, making the market commercially viable while culturally powerful.While international stars have been creating a frenzy, the Indian superstars are not falling behind. 2025 not only saw a big gathering for the foreign names, but the household names also sent waves of wonder during their Indian and international stages.Diljit Dosanjh’s high-voltage “Dil-Luminati” tour powered through North America, Europe, and the Middle East, with sell-out arena dates across cities such as Vancouver, Toronto, Houston, Los Angeles, London, and Dubai.AR Rahman continued to draw packed houses with his “Harmony of Hearts” shows across India and major overseas markets, including the US, Canada, the UK, and the Gulf. Sunidhi Chauhan’s “I Am Home” tour kept venues buzzing from Mumbai to Melbourne.Arijit Singh sold out arena nights in Dubai, London, Birmingham, Sydney, and Toronto, underlining his unmatched global pull. And the world took notes. His international footprint most recently showed up with his Ed Sheeran collaboration on the superhit “Sapphire.”The world is noticing too—most recently via his Ed Sheeran collaboration, “Sapphire.” And this is only part of the story: Shreya Ghoshal, Shankar–Ehsaan–Loy, and several others continue to command international stages with ease.Historically, India was not a default stop on world tours.While Indian fans resonated deeply with global music, logistical challenges, visa delays, security concerns and weak event management often deterred artists.Metallica’s cancelled 2011 India show remains a cautionary tale. The event was postponed and later called off entirely, triggering riots and arrests, and damaging India’s reputation among global promoters.But stakeholders have gradually worked to flip that script.“We’ve spent years working closely with global promoters, agents and artist teams, ensuring India is not just a stop but a destination that matches global benchmarks,” Pugalia says.Audience management has also improved.“There were clear signboards, route guides and transport information shared with tickets,” Gursshheen notes. “There was a large team managing queues and seating.”Yet challenges remain.“Parking, public washrooms and security are still issues,” Sarim says. “I’ve lost two phones at concerts.”Recent incidents, including physical altercations at concerts like Karan Aujla’s Gurgaon show, highlight the need for better civic sense and crowd discipline.As demand continues to outpace infrastructure, experts stress that long-term success will depend not just on fan passion, but on governance, public conduct and sustained investment in large-capacity venues.For many touring artists, India has evolved from a novelty stop to a meaningful fan engagement market. Several trends illustrate this shift. From global streams to live public reception clearl reflect the massive shift in people’s reception.Brands and sponsors are also walking the extra mile to elevate the experience by extending the space to a shared experience with merchandise, interactive spaces, photobooths and other amenities designed for the fans to not just attend the shows but an extension of it.Among all this, for an economy like India, affordability plays a huge role. However, population scale compensates for that gap, placing India in a competitive space.Dua Lipa's Mumbai concert in November 2024 drew 35,000 fans, generating crores despite the discounted tiers. Enrique Iglesias' Oct 2025 MMRDA show was also sold out in hours to lakhs of millennials, turning volume into viable economics where Western acts once saw losses.“With the introduction of the variable pricing model, we have been able to drive a shift in the ‘late-buying’ pattern, where customers have begun making the most of early bird offers or introductory prices,” said Pugalia.This positions India as a market with both cultural influence and commercial viability.India is transitioning from a wildcard destination to a stable touring market.Fans of artists like BTS and Khalid have been waiting to find India on their tour lists. While BTS shared Mumbai being one of the venues for their cancelled Map of the Soul ON:E concert due to the pandemic, their 2026 tour calendar still does not list India as one of their stops.The wishlist for the Indian fans, however, is long.“Charlie Puth!” Sarim speaks up in a heartbeat when asked about who he wishes to see live in India. “Artists like Taylor Swift , Jennifer Lopez, Beyoncé, and Shakira would find an audience here that is ready and enthusiastic,” Gursshheen shares her list of favourites she awaits.When asked about what drives the artist's plan and how the pitch is prepared, Naman Pugalia shares a meticulous list: “The curation of an artist roster has numerous moving parts and is a fruit of long months of labour. Global touring routes of artists, discovery of new sounds and performers for a landscape, research and matching of potential artist names with the Indian consumer palate and appetite, streaming popularity in a market and deducing from it as also significant diversity across the roster are key factors of consideration. ”Development and repurposing of venues are consistently underway. The touring frequency for concerts in India is seeing a new rise. The long-term seems promising to witness India positioned as a permanent stop on the world touring maps of major artists.Venues are being upgraded, touring frequency is rising, and the momentum is undeniable.But the journey is far from complete. Infrastructure gaps, crowd management challenges and civic behaviour remain critical hurdles. India’s rise as a global concert hotspot will ultimately depend on whether scale is matched with responsibility.","The year 2026 is packed with events and shows that bring the musical soul of fans to life.

Monkey pox strain links Kerala cases to foreign travel: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/monkey-pox-strain-links-kerala-cases-to-foreign-travel-study/articleshow/126869621.cms,"PUNE: A first-of-its-kind genetic study of a newer and more stubborn Mpox variant detected in Kerala has linked those cases to international travel and reported signs of continued human-to-human transmission. The study of Mpox Clade Ib, which has been driving outbreaks in parts of Africa and has since showed up in several countries outside the continent, showed that it is prone to spreading faster and wider than older variants of the virus, necessitating enhanced surveillance.The study, led by researchers from Pune's ICMR-National Institute of Virology and teams from Viral Research and Diagnostic Laboratories across India, focused on 10 lab-confirmed cases of Mpox Clade Ib in Kerala between Sept 2024 and March 2025.The findings, published in the journal Virology, indicate active viral evolution with implications for disease surveillance and public health preparedness. ""The study confirmed the Mpox virus is indeed mutating, as we found a distinctive mutational pattern that signals sustained human-to-human transmission,"" a researcher said.Scientists found the mutation pattern stronger in Clade Ib than in older forms of the virus, suggesting it continues to adapt while circulating.""The sequences also carried mutations in several genes that had earlier been identified as hotspots in Clade Ib strains from the Democratic Republic of Congo, pointing to evolutionary convergence across different regions,"" a scientist involved in the study said.A new mutation was detected in six of the 10 cases. The researchers studied patients' symptoms, viral load, immune response and the full genetic sequences of the virus. The findings showed that the virus arrived in India not through one carrier but as part of a wider regional spread linked to international travel.Epidemiological analysis showed nine of the 10 patients had travelled abroad prior to testing positive for the strain. Local transmission was noted in one person.","Mpox clade ib has been driving outbreaks in parts of africa and has since showed up in several countries outside the continent.

Sunita Willaims Is Free: Hugs, Tears At ISS As SpaceX Replacement Crew Meets Stranded Astronauts

NEW DELHI: Calling her visit to India a homecoming, Indian-origin Nasa astronaut Sunita Williams on Tuesday said India held personal importance for her as it was the country where her father was born.Speaking at an interactive session at the American Center in New Delhi, Williams said, ""One of the first things you do when you get to space is that we all want to look for our home, like our immediate home. I grew up in Massachusetts. My father's from India. My mother's from Slovenia. I'm obviously looking for these places to call home.""Williams also spoke about her extended stay aboard the International Space Station after an eight-day mission stretched to more than nine months due to technical issues with the Boeing spacecraft. Recalling life aboard the ISS, she said, “We are not the best singers, but we can make space cakes,” drawing laughter from the audience. “You would see almost 12 people on the ISS at one point in time,” she said.Reflecting on how space travel changed her outlook, Williams said, “It really makes you feel like we are just one,” adding that differences between people seem far smaller when seen from orbit.""Every person I know is there, every animal, every plant, everything we know is there. We're all in this one little space in our solar system, and I think it changes your perception about us having any differences. It really makes you feel like we are just one and we all should probably work a little bit closer and easier together,"" Williams said.",Nasa astronaut sunita williams says india holds personal importance for her as it was the country where her father was born.

Hope against Chikungunya: ICMR steps in as cases rise across India,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/hope-against-chikungunya-icmr-steps-in-as-cases-rise-across-india/articleshow/126761072.cms,"AI image

NEW DELHI: With Chikungunya continuing to leave thousands of Indians with prolonged and debilitating joint pain, the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR) has moved to fast-track a potential antiviral treatment, inviting Indian companies to help develop and manufacture an experimental RNA-based therapy.The initiative comes amid a sustained disease burden. World Health Organisation surveillance data show India recorded over 30,000 suspected Chikungunya cases and nearly 1,800 laboratory-confirmed cases between January and March 2025, with Maharashtra, Karnataka and Tamil Nadu among the worst-affected states.Against this backdrop, scientists at ICMR’s National Institute of Virology (NIV), Pune, have developed an experimental RNA-interference–based therapy that directly targets the Chikungunya virus. In pre-clinical studies, the treatment completely suppressed viral replication in laboratory cell lines and mouse models by silencing two essential viral genes — E2 and nsP1. The findings have prompted ICMR to offer the technology for transfer to industry.Explaining its significance, Dr Ekta Gupta, Professor of Clinical Virology at ILBS, New Delhi, said, “RNA interference blocks viral protein formation by targeting messenger RNA.In Chikungunya, NIV’s RNAi approach targeting E2 and nsP1 has shown complete viral suppression in vivo with a single dose. While laboratory results are encouraging, clinical trials are needed. This is important because there is currently no vaccine or antiviral for a disease that causes significant morbidity in parts of the country. ”Highlighting the clinical potential and challenges, Dr Neha Rastogi, Senior Consultant (Infectious Diseases) at Fortis Gurugram, said, “By targeting key viral genes such as E2 and nsP1, RNA-interference therapy can block viral entry and replication at an early stage and reduce the risk of resistance. The main challenge is safe delivery of RNA into target cells, with lipid nanoparticles showing promise, and combination therapy may further improve effectiveness. ”India has faced major Chikungunya outbreaks in the past. A study published in Emerging Infectious Diseases estimates that the 2006 epidemic affected about 1.39 million people nationwide. More recent research in Scientific Reports (2025) shows nearly 480 outbreaks across around 30 states and Union Territories since 2015, highlighting the virus’s continued spread.Despite recurring outbreaks, treatment remains largely limited to pain relief, even though joint pain can persist for months or years and affect livelihoods.Under the new initiative, ICMR will license the NIV-developed technology to one or more Indian manufacturers on a non-exclusive basis to accelerate development and access, while companies handle production and regulatory approvals.Public-health experts say that if the therapy proves safe and effective in human trials, it could reduce long-term disability and healthcare costs linked to Chikungunya, while strengthening India’s preparedness for future outbreaks.","Icmr invites indian companies to help develop and manufacture an experimental rna-based therapy.

Bharat Coking Coal IPO: Stock lists strongly at over 95% premium; makes strong debut,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/bharat-coking-coal-ipo-stock-lists-strongly-at-over-95-premium-makes-strong-debut/articleshow/126669083.cms,"Representative image (AI-generated)

Shares of Bharat Coking Coal Limited (BCCL) made a strong debut on the stock exchanges on Monday, nearly doubling from their issue price after the company’s Rs 1,071 crore initial public offering drew overwhelming investor demand.The stock listed at Rs 45 on the NSE, a premium of 95.6% over the issue price of Rs 23 and at Rs 45.21 on the BSE, marking a gain of 96.6%. Ahead of listing, the company was valued at around Rs 10,711 crore.The IPO, which was open for subscription from January 9 to January 13, was entirely an offer for sale by promoter Coal India Limited and did not involve any fresh capital raise. Proceeds from the issue went to the promoter, while public shareholding increased following the listing.Investor interest in the issue was exceptionally strong, with the IPO subscribed 147 times overall. Demand was high across all categories, led by non-institutional investors, while qualified institutional buyers also oversubscribed their portion multiple times. Retail participation was also strong.Market participants had widely expected a strong listing, supported by high grey market premiums and the company’s strategic role in India’s steel value chain.Analysts said that the debut reflected confidence in Bharat Coking Coal’s dominant position in the domestic coking coal segment.Gaurav Garg, research analyst at Lemon Markets Desk, said the response to the issue highlighted investor belief in the company’s long-term prospects.“The strong response to the Bharat Coking Coal IPO underscores investor confidence in the company’s monopolistic position in India’s coking coal segment and its long-term demand visibility,” he said.Garg added that the anchor book provided early validation, while heavy non-institutional participation signalled expectations of listing gains.Bharat Coking Coal is India’s largest producer of coking coal and the only significant domestic supplier of prime coking coal, a key raw material for steel production.Incorporated in 1972, the company operates 34 mines across the Jharia coalfields in Jharkhand and the Raniganj coalfields in West Bengal, comprising both underground and opencast operations. Its key customers include steel producers and power companies.As of April 2024, the company’s estimated coking coal reserves stood at about 7.91 billion tonnes, accounting for nearly 21.5% of India’s total coking coal resources. In FY25, Bharat Coking Coal produced around 58.5% of the country’s domestic coking coal output.The company has steadily ramped up production in recent years. Coal output increased from 30.5 million tonnes in FY22 to about 40.5 million tonnes in FY25, supported by mine expansions, the reopening of discontinued underground mines and efficiency improvements at coal washeries.On the financial front, Bharat Coking Coal reported revenue of Rs 14,401–14,402 crore and a profit after tax of Rs 1,240 crore in FY25. While earnings have seen some volatility due to fluctuations in coal prices and costs, the company remains debt-free and cash-generative. As of September 2025, it had total assets of Rs 18,711 crore and a net worth of Rs 5,831 crore.Following the listing, Coal India’s shareholding in Bharat Coking Coal has reduced to about 90% from 100%, improving the public float while retaining government control.As a wholly owned subsidiary earlier, BCCL has benefited from Coal India’s technical expertise, financial strength and operational scale.Analysts see the stock as a long-term play linked to India’s infrastructure push and growth in steel demand, though they caution that near-term performance will depend on broader market conditions and trends in coal pricing.“The scarcity value of a pure-play coking coal producer and steady demand from the steel sector support favourable secondary market sentiment,” Garg said. He added that investors should track earnings consistency over time.","Shares of bharat coking coal limited (bccl) made a strong debut on the stock exchanges on monday, nearly doubling from their issue price.

What the New York Mets Gain and Weighing Risks

The New York Mets are adjusting after parting ways with a player who spent nearly a decade with the organization. With Brandon Nimmo now in Texas, the front office is focused on finding a short-term outfield option that limits spending and avoids long-term commitments.That approach has led them to Max Kepler. He is not viewed as a marquee signing but as a steady replacement. A reported one-year deal worth $7.6 million would give the Mets reliable defense and left-handed power while preserving roster flexibility.The New York Mets’ direction changed after a one-for-one trade with the Texas Rangers sent Nimmo to Texas in exchange for second baseman Marcus Semien. Nimmo waived his full no-trade clause to complete the deal, ending his eight-year, $162 million tenure in New York.Nimmo was still productive in 2025. He appeared in 143 games and hit .261 with 23 home runs and 82 RBIs.Even so, the Mets chose to address their infield and manage payroll. Semien now anchors second base, but the trade left a clear vacancy in left field.Max Kepler became a free agent after a one-year, $10 million season with Philadelphia that was limited by knee issues. His surface numbers declined, but the Mets value his defense and remaining power. In 2025, he ranked among the league’s best outfield arms and fits cleanly into a corner role.A short-term deal also matches the Mets’ plans. Prospect Carson Benge is expected to push for a larger role soon, and Max Kepler would fill the gap without blocking that path. The lower salary compared to Nimmo’s deal also leaves room to address pitching.Max Kepler would bring reliable defense in the corner outfield, a strong arm, and pop against right-handed pitching without a big price tag. His expected salary is well below Brandon Nimmo’s yearly average, giving the Mets a way to add value while staying mindful of the luxury tax.The concerns are durability and age. Kepler is in his mid-30s and coming off a down year. He also does not solve the center-field situation long term, leaving the Mets to rely on internal options.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Cincinnati Reds predicted to sign $10.2 million New York Yankees; Brady Singer key trade asset? Even with those risks, the move fits the moment.

Nahomi’s honest gym moment connects with fans who understand the ups and downs of working out

Life around professional baseball often appears polished online, but Francisco Alvarez’s partner Nahomi brought something refreshingly genuine to Instagram this week. Her recent posts offered a down to earth look at her fitness journey, blending humour, self awareness, and realistic expectations. Rather than presenting a perfect routine, Nahomi chose honesty, a quality that quickly resonated with fans navigating their own starts and stops with fitness.On Tuesday, Nahomi shared a gym mirror selfie. Wearing a black sports bra, shorts, and sneakers, she stood confidently in front of the mirror with a dumbbell resting on the floor beside her. She captioned the post, “I want to gain 5 kilos by the end of the month.” The post resonated with many of her fans because in a world often dominated by weight loss, her perspective offered a refreshing shift towards honesty and personal goals.The story continued with playful video clips that revealed the reality behind the photo. Nahomi openly admitted that she does not enjoy working out but still makes the effort to show up. Laughing, she joked about wanting to wake up looking “snatched” without putting in the work, a comment many viewers found relatable.She then shared that her workout lasted just two minutes before she had to stop, choosing transparency over perfection.Earlier in the day, Nahomi also reflected on the fitness promise she made to herself at the beginning of the year. “I joined the gym, I told you this would be the year,” she said in another clip. She admitted that February nearly became the point where she quit, explaining she realised she was “already really skinny in the cold.” The remark added depth to her update, touching on how seasons and self perception can shape motivation.As fans continue to follow Alvarez’s journey with the New York Mets, Nahomi’s posts offer a relatable off field perspective. The openness with which she has embraced flaws and sincerity makes her a visit to the gym something the fans actually relate to, which proves that being real can sometimes impress the most.","Francisco alvarez’s partner nahomi shared a gym mirror selfie this week.

Dubai and the wider United Arab Emirates are advancing a major shift in private-sector compensation norms with a new minimum wage policy for Emirati workers as a part of the broader efforts to strengthen labour standards and boost Emiratisation. Although the UAE historically did not have a universal minimum wage, recent regulatory changes have introduced a formal floor for Emirati nationals employed in the private sector. This move is being closely watched by employers, economists and expatriate workers alike.As of January 01, 2026, the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) has mandated that Emirati employees in the private sector must receive a minimum salary of AED 6,000 per month, up from the previous AED 5,000 requirement. This wage floor applies to all new, renewed and amended work permits for Emirati nationals and companies must adjust salaries of currently employed Emiratis to meet this threshold by June 30, 2026. Firms that fail to comply face potential penalties from July 01, 2026, including exclusion from Emiratisation quotas and suspension of new work permits, underscoring the government’s commitment to enforcing the policy.While this new minimum wage applies only to UAE citizens and not to expatriate workers, it marks a significant policy evolution in a labour market long characterised by the absence of a legally binding wage floor for foreign employees. Traditionally, wage levels for non-nationals varied widely across sectors, from skilled professionals earning well above market averages to low-wage labour roles without any statutory minimum, reflecting the UAE’s free-market approach to compensation. Federal law does require that wages be sufficient to meet basic living needs but until now there has been no nationwide minimum wage enforced across the board.The UAE does not have a universal statutory minimum wage across all sectors. However, the Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) has issued salary guidelines for specific categories of employees that many employers use as benchmarks.Previous guideline-style minimum wage recommendations (e.g., AED 5,000–12,000 for graduates or technicians) noted in some 2025 reports were non-binding and not enforced as legal minima. The new AED 6,000 minimum wage for Emiratis is part of the UAE’s broader Emiratisation strategy to promote citizen participation in the private workforce and ensure competitive, fair compensation.These figures do not represent legally enforceable minimum wages but are widely used as industry standards and visa/salary benchmarks for certain roles in Dubai/UAE. The UAE’s current labour framework (as of 2025) includes no binding minimum wage law, although the MoHRE has the authority to set one in the future.Economists and HR specialists say the policy supports the UAE’s Emiratisation strategy, which aims to increase citizen participation in private-sector employment while also ensuring competitive, fair compensation. Employers now face both an administrative and cultural shift as they adjust payroll systems, modify contracts and align hiring policies with updated labour standards. As the UAE continues to modernise its labour laws, further reforms including potential broader minimum wage frameworks remain part of ongoing discussions among policymakers, workers and business leaders.","From 1 january 2026, the uae government has set a minimum salary of aed 6,000 per month for emirati citizens working in the private sector.

“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work”

Who was Thomas Alva Edison



What this Thomas Edison quote means



“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.”

Why this quote still matters



How people relate to it today







People remember Thomas A. Edison as one of the most important inventors. He worked on a lot of ideas and had thousands of patents over the course of his life. Many of his inventions are now a part of daily life, like the electric light bulb and sound recording devices. But Edison was known for more than just what he made. People also knew how he thought about work, hard work, and success., is one of the most popular things he has said. Edison talks about a simple habit that a lot of people have. People often look for opportunities in things that seem fun, easy, or rewarding right away. It's easier to ignore something when it looks hard or requires a lot of work. Edison thought this was where a lot of people went wrong. He says that opportunities don't usually come in a polished or attractive way. Instead, it often comes in a quiet way that looks like work that needs to be done.Thomas Alva Edison was born in 1847 in the US. He was curious about how things worked from a young age. As he got older, this curiosity turned into a habit of trying new things and making old ones better. Edison worked on many projects at once and thought that progress came from working hard over and over again instead of getting quick results.Some of the most important things he invented were the electric light bulb, phonograph, and the motion picture camera. He also built labs where groups of people could work together on long-term experiments. Edison thought that being patient, testing things out, and working hard every day were all important parts of coming up with new ideas. A lot of historical records say that he saw innovation as a normal part of his job, not a flash of genius.Edison said,He was using a simple picture to explain a common reaction. Overalls are clothes that people wear to do physical or practical work. Edison used this picture to show that opportunities often seem normal and hard to get.A lot of people think that success will come quickly or with little work. They might want results right away, without having to learn, practice, or fail along the way. Edison said that real opportunities usually require work first and pay off later. Because of this, people sometimes miss out on chances that could have helped them grow.This idea is still important because it shows how people make choices every day. Students might not want to study subjects that need more practice. Workers might not want to do tasks that seem hard. People may put off their personal goals if they seem hard or uncertain. Edison's words remind readers that trying hard doesn't mean you've failed; it usually means that something important is possible.The quote tells people to think about work in a new way. Instead of viewing work as a hindrance, it proposes perceiving it as an integral component of the opportunity.This quote is often used in classrooms, offices, and talks about how to grow as a person. Teachers use it to show how important it is to be consistent. Employers share it to show that hard work pays off in the long run. People think about it when they are deciding whether or not to take on tasks that need a lot of patience.Edison's words still ring true because they describe a reality that many people know. At first, opportunities may not seem appealing, but those who are willing to put in the work often reap the benefits in the end.","Thomas alva edison was born in 1847 in the us.

From Olympic gold to global business icon, Anthony Joshua's financial journey



Anthony Joshua has turned his boxing success into a legacy. From Olympic hero to global superstar, his rise over the past decade has been steady and powerful. Now, the British star is not only known for knockouts. He is also known for smart contracts, big-brand deals, and careful business moves. His net worth growth reflects consistency at the top level of sport.As of now, Anthony Joshua’s estimated net worth stands at around $150 million (per celebrity net worth). Some reports suggest it could rise closer to $200 million after his recent mega fights. His paycheques come from huge fight purses, global endorsements, and business investments. Joshua is now one of the richest boxers in the world.Anthony Joshua’s big payday journey began after his gold medal win at the 2012 London Olympics. By 2016, his professional career was booming. He won world titles and quickly became a box office star. His early title fights earned him millions and pushed his net worth into the tens of millions.The defining moment came in April 2017. Joshua defeated Wladimir Klitschko at Wembley Stadium.The fight made him a global name. It also delivered one of his first massive paydays. From that point, Joshua became a stadium fighter who could sell out any venue.Between 2017 and 2018, Joshua defended his titles against Carlos Takam, Joseph Parker, and Alexander Povetkin. Each fight brought eight-figure earnings. Sponsors followed. Brands like Under Armour, Beats by Dre, and Hugo Boss signed major deals with him. His clean image and athletic build made him highly marketable.In 2019, Joshua reached a financial peak. Although he lost to Andy Ruiz Jr. in June, the rematch later that year changed everything. He earned a reported $57.5 million in Saudi Arabia. This became the biggest payday of his career at the time. His net worth jumped sharply after that fight.Anthony Joshua faced setbacks in 2021 and 2022 with losses to Oleksandr Usyk. Still, the money kept flowing. His second fight against Usyk alone earned him over $40 million. Even in defeat, Joshua remained one of boxing’s highest-paid stars.From 2023 onward, Anthony Joshua rebuilt both his career and brand. Wins over Jermaine Franklin and Robert Helenius kept him active. In March 2024, he knocked out Francis Ngannou and earned around $50 million. This single fight added significantly to his wealth.By late 2025, reports claimed Joshua had earned over $195 million in total career income. His December 2025 fight vs Jake Paul was another big payday. This pushed his net worth toward $150 million.Outside the ring, Joshua has invested in real estate and business ventures through his company, 258 Group. These assets give him income beyond boxing. From 2016 to 2026, Anthony Joshua built his net worth with power and smart planning.Also Read: Kamaru Usman faces fans wrath after he releases video of Anthony Joshua’s emotional private call after tragic Nigeria crash","Anthony joshua is one of the richest boxers in the world.

Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, recently cut down her stake at the company by nearly 50% to donate to charities. A report claims that the billionaire philanthropist donated millions of dollars to a funding network that supports organisations now facing FBI and congressional investigations over alleged ties to Hamas. In 2025, Scott reportedly donated $5 million, and in 2021, $10 million, to the Solidaire Network through her charity, Yield Giving. The network describes itself as connecting social movements with donors to build systems based on love and justice.However, Solidaire Network has funded groups such as Students for Justice in Palestine (SJP) and American Muslims for Palestine (AMP), according to tax records and press releases reviewed by Fortune. Both organisations are under investigation by the House and Senate for allegedly working with the terror group Hamas to organise anti-Israel protests in the United States.The House Committee on Oversight and Accountability sent a letter to AMP's executive director in May 2024 expressing concern that groups spreading pro-Hamas messages and breaking laws on college campuses may be receiving money from sources supporting Hamas or other terrorist organisations.US Senator Tom Cotton also asked the FBI in September 2025 to investigate the Palestinian Youth Movement (PYM), calling it hateful toward Jewish people after its leader, Aisha Nizar, urged supporters to disrupt the US F-35 fighter jet supply chain, the report noted.In a statement (shared by Fortune), Cotton said,Scott donated more than $7 billion in 2025 alone, bringing her total giving since 2020 to $26 billion across over 2,700 donations. With a net worth of about $40 billion, mostly from her divorce settlement, she ranks among the world's biggest donors alongside Bill Gates, Melinda French Gates, and Warren Buffett. Most of her 2025 donations supported diversity programmes, disaster relief, and colleges.It's important to note that the Solidaire Network also funds other progressive groups working on racial and gender equality, climate change, and economic fairness. Scott was also just one of more than 280 people who donated to Solidaire Network in 2021.the Solidaire Network noted.Around that time, Solidaire Network had just given out multimillion-dollar grants through its Black Liberation Pooled Fund, Movement Protection Fund, and Movement Infrastructure Fund.As Scott's donations have no restrictions, which means the receiving organisation can spend the money however it chooses, there's no proof that her 2021 or 2025 gifts went directly to SJP or AMP.On January 30, 2024, Solidaire Network also announced it started a Unity & Power Fund to support theSJP and AMP mainly focus onand firm opposition to Israel.Stacey Krueger of Palestine Legal said in a statement.While some people have criticised Scott's donation to Solidaire Network, she's widely recognised as one of the most impactful charitable donors in recent years. She's made a real difference for diversity-focused organisations and groups working on higher education, veterans' issues, social justice, disaster relief, and climate change.For example, Scott gave $80 million to Howard University last fall, and the school said the gift came at anas the US government shutdown delayed annual federal money the university receives to support students, academic programs, research, and hospital operations.Scott has also said her giving was inspired by her college roommate, who lent her $1,000 so she wouldn't have to quit school, and her dentist, who gave her free dental work after seeing her use denture glue to fix a broken tooth in college.In a blog post from December 2025, Scott wrote,Sotheby's International Realty said Scott has donated an estimated $14 billion to causes, including racial equality, LGBTQ+ equality, strengthening functional democracy, and climate action. She now ranks sixth on the list of the world's top 10 philanthropists, behind Bill Gates and Warren Buffett. The Sotheby's list adds that Scott's gifts support nonprofit groups working against racial injustice, advancing gender equality, and backing public health programs.Before she authored her first novel or assisted in the early formation of Amazon, MacKenzie Scott was tutored by Nobel Prize-winning author Toni Morrison at Princeton University. Morrison had a significant influence on Scott's writing career and assisted her in gaining early employment, including where she met her ex-husband, Jeff Bezos.","Mackenzie scott reportedly donated $5 million in 2025 and $10 million in 2021 to the solidaire network through her charity, yield giving.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to engineers: I want you to stop coding and start...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-to-engineers-i-want-you-to-stop-coding-and-start-/articleshow/126543905.cms,"Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang aims for engineers to code zero percent, leveraging AI assistants like Cursor to tackle complex, undiscovered problems. He believes this 'Purpose vs Task' approach, akin to radiology's evolution, will elevate human roles. While some, like Cursor's CEO, caution against unchecked AI development, Huang remains confident in this human-centric future for innovation.

Why radiologists didn't disappear, and why engineers might not either

Vibe coding pioneers warn Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ’s approach has limits





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wants his engineers to spend exactly zero percent of their time writing code. In a recent appearance on the No Priors AI podcast, Huang revealed that every engineer at the $3 trillion chipmaker now uses Cursor, an AI coding assistant, throughout their workday. His goal? Free them entirely from what he calls 'syntax' so they can focus on finding and solving problems that haven't been cracked yet.""Nothing would give me more joy than if none of our engineers were coding at all,"" Huang said. ""And they were just purely solving undiscovered problems.""This isn't just philosophical musing. Huang has been pushing a framework he calls 'Purpose vs Task' across multiple interviews in recent months, including a viral appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience. The idea is simple: coding is the task, but discovering and solving novel problems is the purpose. AI should handle the former so humans can concentrate on the latter.Huang points to radiology as proof this approach creates jobs rather than eliminates them. Years ago, AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton predicted radiologists would be obsolete within five years because computers could scan images faster than humans. Instead, radiologist numbers have grown.The reason, Huang argues, is that reading scans was always just a task—the real purpose is diagnosing disease and improving patient outcomes. When AI took over the grunt work, demand for the human expertise behind it actually expanded.At Nvidia's recent all-hands meeting, Huang reportedly pushed back hard against managers who were telling teams to dial back AI usage. ""Are you insane?"" he said, according to Business Insider. He promised employees they'd still have work to do—just more ambitious work, the report said.The push comes at a pivotal moment for software engineering. Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently revealed that AI now writes over 30% of new code at the company, while Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei claimed Claude generates 90% of his firm's code. Yet a METR study from July found AI assistants actually decreased experienced developers' productivity by 19%—even though participants expected a 20% boost. The gap between hype and reality suggests Huang's vision of code-free engineers may be further out than his enthusiasm implies.Not everyone shares Huang's unbridled optimism. Michael Truell, CEO of Cursor itself—the $29 billion startup whose AI tool Nvidia has embraced—recently cautioned against 'vibe coding,' where developers let AI build software without reviewing the output. ""If you close your eyes and don't look at the code and have AIs build things with shaky foundations, things start to kind of crumble,"" Truell told Fortune's Brainstorm AI conference.Even Andrej Karpathy, the former Tesla AI director who coined the term 'vibe coding,' admitted his recent Nanochat project was ""basically entirely hand-written"" because AI agents ""just didn't work well enough."" He recently warned fellow programmers: ""I've never felt this much behind. The profession is being dramatically refactored.""For now, the Nvidia CEO is betting big that humans who focus on purpose rather than tasks will come out ahead. Whether that bet pays off for the millions of developers who actually write code for a living remains the undiscovered problem.","Jensen huang, ceo of $3 trillion chipmaker nvidia, wants engineers to spend zero percent of their time writing code.

Merge Labs vs Neuralink





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has announced an investment in Merge Labs, a brain-computer interface (BCI) startup which was founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Rival to Elon Musk ’s Neuralink, the mission of Merge Labs is to develop safe and scaleable brain-computer interfaces. “We are excited to support and collaborate with Merge Labs as they turn an ambitious idea into reality and ultimately products that are useful for people,” said the company.OpenAI revealed that funding made by the company will support Merge Labs’ mission of creating safe, scalable brain-computer interfaces that could one day allow humans to interact with artificial intelligence directly through neural signals. The company has not yet disclosed the size of the investment, but the partnership underscores OpenAI’s growing interest in technologies that extend beyond software into hardware and human augmentation.Merge Labs is a research lab with the long-term mission of bridging biological and artificial intelligence to maximize human ability, agency, and experience. It is developing fundamentally new approaches⁠ (opens in a new window) to BCIs that are safe and interface with the brain at much higher bandwidth by combining biology, devices, and AI.The company is focused on creating non-invasive neural interfaces that can translate brain activity into digital commands. Unlike more invasive approaches that require surgical implants, Merge Labs aims to build consumer-ready devices that are both accessible and ethically designed.The company’s early prototypes reportedly use advanced sensors and machine learning models to interpret neural signals, with potential applications ranging from medical rehabilitation to enhanced productivity tools.Elon Musk founded Neuralink in 2016 and till now the company has made significant progress in developing brain implants which enable people with paralysis to control devices with the help of their thoughts. The Elon Musk-owned company recently raised $600 million at a $9 billion valuation and is conducting human trials.Merge Labs on the other hand, is reportedly working on less invasive brain interfaces with a strong emphasis on AI-powered enhancements. The focus of the startup is not just medical rehabilitation but broader human-AI integration.“I believe the merge has already started,” Altman wrote in a 2017 blog post. “We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants”.","Merge labs is a brain-computer interface (bci) startup founded by openai ceo sam altman.

Artificial intelligence is no longer something people only argue about in tech conferences or future forecasts. It is already quietly shaping daily life in profound and often unexpected ways. From customer support chats to recommendation engines, from coding tools to medical research, AI is now part of how work gets done efficiently. And according to Bill Gates , the pace of change is about to speed up even more dramatically.In his latest annual letter, The Year Ahead, the Microsoft co-founder lays out a clear message. AI will reshape society, economies, and jobs faster than most people expect. Gates says he remains optimistic about technology, but this time his optimism comes with serious warnings. The benefits are real. So are the risks. And ignoring either would be a grave mistake.Gates has spent decades watching technology alter economies and daily life. In his letter, he says AI is different from past waves of innovation. Not just faster, but broader. He argues that artificial intelligence could affect more parts of society than any previous human-made tool.He points to progress already happening. AI is accelerating disease research, improving climate modelling, and expanding access to digital education.Tasks that once took years can now be completed in months, sometimes weeks. For Gates, this is proof that AI can solve hard problems if used well.But he also stresses that hope alone is not a strategy. Institutions, governments, and workers are not fully prepared for how quickly these changes are arriving. Without planning, the speed of AI adoption could leave many people behind.One of Gates’ biggest concerns is how AI could be misused. As advanced tools become more accessible, the barrier to harmful use drops. He has warned that open-source AI systems could be exploited by bad actors, including non-state groups.In particular, Gates has raised alarms about biological threats. He suggests that AI-assisted misuse could pose risks even greater than naturally occurring pandemics. That is not a casual statement. It reflects a growing fear among researchers that powerful tools, in the wrong hands, could scale harm faster than ever before.Gates argues that global cooperation is essential. Clear rules, oversight, and governance structures are needed. At the same time, he acknowledges the tension. Too many restrictions could slow beneficial innovation. Too little could invite danger. Finding the balance will not be easy.Jobs sit at the centre of Gates’ warning. He says AI makes it possible to produce more goods and services with less human labour. That reality will change how companies hire and how work is valued.Some of this is already visible. In software development, AI tools help programmers write, test, and maintain code faster. Gates notes that developers can now be significantly more productive, which lowers costs and reshapes team structures.He also points to sectors like warehouse operations and phone-based customer service. As AI systems improve, these roles are likely to face pressure. Automation will not arrive all at once, but it will arrive steadily.Gates does not frame this as doom. He frames it as a disruption that needs preparation.Beyond job losses, Bill Gates talks about how work itself might change. If AI boosts productivity enough, shorter workweeks could become possible. The same output, fewer hours. It sounds appealing. But he is careful not to present it as automatic.Whether these gains benefit most people depends on policy choices. Who owns the productivity gains. How companies share them. Without thoughtful decisions, Gates warns that efficiency could concentrate wealth instead of spreading it.This is where governments and institutions matter. AI alone will not deliver fairness. People have to decide what to do with the gains it creates.","Gates says he remains optimistic about technology, but this time his optimism comes with serious warnings.

Grok AI restricts image editing features to paid X users

Elon Musk warns, ‘Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will …’





Grok the AI chatbot of Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence firm xAI will no longer be able to generate sexualised or revealing images of real people. The company took this decision after the mounting criticism and regulatory scrutiny. In a post blog post share on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), the company company confirmed that it has implemented technological measures in to order to prevent Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people. This move of the company comes after Grok users were exploiting the tool to create AI deepfakes of women and minors, undressing them in manipulated images.California Attorney General Rob Bonta revealed he had launched an investigation into Grok’s role in producing sexualized deepfakes, citing a flood of complaints in recent weeks. Meanwhile, Indonesia and Malaysia suspended Grok entirely, becoming the first countries to ban the tool. Lawmakers in the UK have also publicly considered a suspension.In a statement posted on X’s safety account the company wrote:Recently, Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok, integrated into his social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), has now announced that its image generation and editing tools will now be restricted to paying subscribers. Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers. You can subscribe to unlock these features,” Grok posted late January 8, linking to X’s premium membership page.Elon Musk said that anyone using AI chatbot Grok to make illegal content on his platform X (formerly known as Twitter) will be punished. Musk’s comments came after the chatbot – hardwired into X came under fire for producing obscene/ non-consensual images, including women and children. In an online post, the tech billionaire wrote “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content”. The Tesla CEO was responding to a post on “inappropriate images” generated by grok.DogeDesigner, followed by Elon Musk wrote in the post: “Some people are saying Grok is creating inappropriate images. But that’s like blaming a pen for writing something bad. A pen doesn’t decide what gets written. The person holding it does. Grok works the same way. What you get depends a lot on what you put in. Think about it!”.","Elon musk’s ai chatbot grok, integrated into his social media platform x (formerly known as twitter), has now announced that its image generation and editing tools will now be restricted to paying subscribers.
