NEW DELHI: India's exports to China have increased 37% to $14.2 billion during April-Dec, govt told Rajya Sabha Friday, with shipments during the last month of 2025 jumping 67% to over $2 billion.Imports during the first nine months were up 13.5% to nearly $96 billion, latest data from the commerce department showed.In Parliament, junior minister for commerce and industry Jitin Prasada said that most of the goods imported from China are capital goods, intermediate goods and raw materials.Replying to a question, he said that during the previous financial year, 2024-25, sectors such as fertilisers (61.4%), chemicals (19.7%), iron and steel (10.3%) and man-made yarn (9.5%) have seen lower imports from China in 2024-25.""In 2024-25, a decline in imports from China was observed across several sectors compared to the previous year,"" Prasada said, responding to a question on India's trade balance with China.He also said active pharmaceutical ingredients, auto components, electronic parts and assemblies and mobile phone parts are imported and then used for making finished products.""These goods are imported for meeting the demand of fast expanding sectors like electronics, pharma, telecom and power in India. The rise in import of electronic components, computer hardware and peripherals, telephone components, etc. can be attributed to the transformation of India into a digitally empowered society and a knowledge economy,"" the minister said.","India's exports to china have increased 37% to $14.2 billion during april-dec. imports during the first nine months were up 13.5% to nearly $96 billion.

50 lakh bought FASTag Annual Pass; 50% rise in short trips,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/50-lakh-bought-fastag-annual-pass-50-rise-in-short-trips/articleshow/128005321.cms,"NHAI (Representative image)

NEW DELHI: Over half a crore highway car users have bought FASTag Annual Pass in past six months since this scheme was launched and there have been 26.5 crore toll payments using the pass @ Rs 15 each at plazas.Data show that there has been a 50% increase in trips of car users who usually took up to a maximum of 100 trips in a year, indicating how the annual pass has encouraged people for more highway travel.NHAI officials said around 28% of total car transactions recorded on the NH network are now being carried out through the FASTag Annual Pass. They added that increased penetration of annual pass among private car users will also help the highways authority for better implementation of Multi Lane Free Flow (MLFF) or barrier-less toll collection, which is being rolled out.“The region-wise analysis shows Chandigarh leads in terms of usage, accounting for 14% of total annual pass transactions across the country, followed by Tamil Nadu at 12.3% and Delhi at 11.5%. These figures demonstrate widespread adoption of the annual pass across diverse geographies from northern urban centres to southern states,” NHAI said.As per the highways authority Bijwasan toll plaza, Delhi-NCR has recorded the maximum of around 57% of total car crossings at the fee plaza using the annual pass, followed by Mundka in Delhi-NCR and Jhinjholi plaza in Sonipat, both registering around 53% of non-commercial vehicle crossings using the annual pass.Applicable across 1,150 fee plazas on national highways and national expressways, the annual pass eliminates the need to frequently recharge FASTag through one-time fee payment of Rs 3,000 for one year validity or 200 toll plaza crossings. The charge for annual pass will be hiked in April aligning with the revision of toll charges.The annual pass gets activated within two hours on the existing FASTag linked to the vehicle after payment of one-time fee through Rajmargyatra app or NHAI website.","Data show that there has been a 50% increase in trips of car users who usually took up to a maximum of 100 trips in a year.

Explained: Why India-EU 'Mother Of All Deals' Matters As Trade Talks Enter Final High Stakes Phase

NEW DELHI: Amid opposition allegations over the India-US trade deal, Union agriculture minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan on Thursday said that the agreement fully safeguards India’s agricultural interests, particularly those of the farm and dairy sectors.Underlining that India’s staple grains, fruits, major crops, millets and dairy products remain completely secure and face no threat whatsoever, Chouhan emphasised that the interests of small and large farmers alike have been fully protected and that the agreement will create fresh opportunities rather than risks for Indian agriculture.Highlighting the export potential unlocked by the agreement, Chouhan, while addressing the media on the issue, noted that India already exports rice to many countries, including the US, and has recently recorded exports worth around Rs 63,000 crore.He said that reduced tariffs will directly benefit India’s rice, spices and textile exports, and that growth in textile exports will help millions of cotton-growing farmers.On certain concerns over an adverse impact of the deal on small farmers, the minister stressed that no sudden or disruptive entry of foreign products into the Indian market will take place.On the confusion triggered by a recent social media post by the US treasury secretary about increased access for American farm products, Chouhan said commerce minister Piyush Goyal has already clarified the facts in Parliament. He reiterated that India has not opened its markets in any way that puts pressure on domestic farmers & that the protections for key agricultural commodities remain intact.“Farmers are our ‘Annadata’, the providers of life. Their welfare is nation’s welfare, and their interests are absolutely secure,” he added.","Union agriculture minister shivraj singh chouhan said that the agreement fully safeguards india’s agricultural interests.

Planning to visit a bank in February? It’s smart to check the holiday schedule first, as an unexpected closure can turn a quick errand into a wasted trip. In India, banks observe both national and state-specific holidays, so closure dates may differ from one region to another. In India, bank holidays include both national and state-specific observances, so closure dates can vary across different regions.Banks will remain closed in Sikkim on account of the Losar festival.Banks will be closed in Maharashtra for Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj Jayanti.Banks will not operate in Mizoram and Arunachal Pradesh in observance of State Day/Statehood Day.Apart from these, banks will also remain closed on second and fourth Saturdays of the month, according to RBI.Being aware of bank holidays in advance can help customers plan essential financial transactions and avoid last-minute hassles. While branches may remain closed on these days, it does not prevent customers from carrying out routine transactions. Digital banking services, including online banking, ATMs, mobile apps, and UPI, remain fully operational for fund transfers, bill payments, and other regular activities.However, services that require a physical visit such as large cash deposits, cheque clearances, or issuing demand drafts will not be available. To prevent inconvenience, account holders are encouraged to plan these tasks ahead and make full use of digital banking options during closures.","Banks will be closed in maharashtra for chhatrapati shivaji maharaj jayanti.

New labour code changes and why companies are making one-time provisions,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/new-labour-code-changes-and-why-companies-are-making-one-time-provisions/articleshow/127929310.cms,"1.

MUMBAI: Most companies reporting their financial results for Q3FY26 are reporting a large one-time provison towards employee benefits attributing it to the new labour code. TOI takes a look at what brought about these changes and how does it affect stakeholders.The change relates mainly to gratuity payments under the Code on Social Security, 2020. The new rules redefine “wages” for calculating gratuity and expand eligibility for fixed-term employees.Under the revised rules, wages used to calculate gratuity must form at least 50% of an employee’s total cost-to-company (CTC). If allowances exceed 50% of CTC, the excess must be added back to wages for gratuity calculation. This increases the base on which gratuity is calculated.The law also allows fixed-term employees to become eligible for gratuity after completing one year of service instead of the earlier five-year requirement. Because of these changes, companies must account for higher future gratuity payouts, forcing them to create one-time provisions in their financial statements.The government introduced the change through the Code on Social Security, 2020, which forms part of four consolidated labour codes replacing 29 older labour laws.The codes were passed by Parliament in 2020, but detailed implementation rules were notified later.The reform aimed to simplify labour laws, improve social security coverage and reflect modern employment practices. A key concern was that many companies structured salaries with a low basic pay and high allowances to reduce statutory payouts such as provident fund and gratuity. The new definition of wages reduces this flexibility.Another trigger was the growing use of fixed-term employment across industries. The government sought to extend social security benefits to such workers, especially in sectors with high attrition and contractual hiring.The new labour codes, including the Social Security Code, came into force on November 21, 2025. While the central framework became effective from that date, states continue to finalise detailed implementation rules.Employees benefit mainly through higher gratuity payouts and wider eligibility. Because gratuity calculations now use a broader wage base, many employees will receive higher retirement or exit benefits.Fixed-term employees, who earlier did not qualify unless they completed five years of service, can now receive gratuity after one year. This benefits workers in sectors with short-term or project-based employment.The changes also aim to bring more transparency to salary structures and expand social security coverage.The financial impact varies depending on salary structure and workforce composition.Manufacturing and heavy industries: These sectors rely heavily on contract and fixed-term workers. The new rules increase gratuity liabilities and could push companies to review workforce models.Technology and IT services: These companies often use allowance-heavy salary structures. They may need to restructure compensation to meet the wage definition norms.Banking and financial services: The sector may see higher statutory benefit costs and increased liabilities for outsourced and contractual staff.Construction: The sector employs a large informal workforce. The new rules increase compliance requirements and settlement obligations.Retail and e-commerce: Companies with seasonal hiring and gig-based employment may face higher employee benefit costs and classification challenges.Healthcare: Round-the-clock operations and contract staffing could raise wage and benefit compliance costs.Manufacturing and heavy industries are expected to make the largest one-time provisions. These sectors typically have a large contract workforce, lower basic salary structures and higher dependence on fixed-term employment, which significantly increases gratuity liabilities.Technology and financial services companies are also likely to see sizeable increases due to changes in salary structure norms, though typically less than manufacturing.","Most companies reporting their financial results for q3fy26 are reporting a large one-time provison towards employee benefits.

The moment a Super Bowl promotion struck the wrong nerve



Super Bowl week always brings strange side stories, but this one didn’t come from a commercial teaser or a celebrity tweet. It surfaced quietly inside a company system, where employees noticed something unusual just days before the championship game. Actor Chris Hemsworth had briefly appeared on an internal organizational chart of Amazon, complete with a flashy title and a company email address. With the Super Bowl approaching and ad campaigns rolling out at full speed, the appearance was clearly tied to one of the game’s high-profile commercials. But inside the company, the reaction wasn’t laughter or excitement. It was confusion, frustration, and, for some, anger.Chris Hemsworth was listed as “Chief Heartthrob,” attached to a team connected to the technology featured in a Super Bowl ad. He was also labeled a bar raiser, a real internal designation usually reserved for employees involved in hiring decisions. The listing included a jokey quote attributed to him, as reported in Reuters. “When I’m not starring in movies, I enjoy spending time with my family, campaigning for Ad Meter votes, snake wrangling, bear wrestling, hammer throwing and a nice cinnamon scrub,” it read.The placement was part of a stunt tied to a Super Bowl commercial built around artificial intelligence. In the ad, Hemsworth imagines increasingly ridiculous scenarios involving an AI assistant, including being crushed by a garage door, drowning in his pool, and wrestling a bear sent after him. By the end, the assistant reassures him that it is ultimately a force for good. On television, it plays as dark humor. Inside the company, it landed differently.The moment came against a difficult backdrop. Recent layoffs at the company had affected thousands of corporate employees, including teams connected to the same technology being promoted in the ad. A disappointing earnings report had already shaken morale. For many employees, seeing a Hollywood star inserted into the org chart felt a bit out of touch.One employee wrote on an internal social platform, as per Reuters, “This definitely makes up for the hollow feeling of cleaning out my peer’s desk and meeting him out front with his boxes given he was laid off last week.” Another added, “It’s less of a joke than it is an insult to the rest of us.”By late Thursday, the moment was over. Hemsworth’s mock role was removed, and his profile was updated to report under a standard department head.","Chris hemsworth was listed as “chief heartthrob,” attached to a team connected to the technology featured in a super bowl ad.

How Roman Reigns and Galina Becker built their massive fortune

Inside the Roman Reigns Anoaʻi family assets and lifestyle

Leati Joseph Anoaʻi, better known as Roman Reigns, and his partner, Galina Becker, are now among the richest couples in professional wrestling. Reigns has gone from WWE prospect to the top man in the ring in ten years, a role that creates lucrative paychecks and international fame. Becker, an ex-college athlete and fitness model, has kept her own presence outside of the ring as well.Collectively, the duo has slowly accumulated a well-documented pot of gold that the media believes is worth up to $23 million in 2026. That figure reflects income from wrestling contracts, endorsements, business interests, and personal investments. Celebrity net worth figures are always debatable, and the combined bankability of Roman Reigns and Galina Becker is a testament to how wisely and proactively the two have handled opportunities beyond the ring.Roman Reigns has been a part of the WWE franchise for quite a long time, and that forms the basis of the household wealth. He is one of the most compensated performers in the company, meaning he has a guaranteed annual earnings plus match bonuses, merchandise royalties, and premium event payouts. Year after year, main event appearances in WrestleMania and other big shows where he fought have bolstered his income. His rise to mainstream fame has also uncovered new avenues, such as sponsorships, appearances in media, or even acting possibilities, which all add to his value.Taking the financial lead, if with less headline, is still the dark horse in Galina Becker. Becker, a former track and field athlete, has experience in fitness modeling and brand partnerships. Taelor has worked with lifestyle and wellness brands and has engaged in small side hustles that create independent income. Becker has also kept her own career, one of the factors that has given the couple's finances some stability, unlike many of the partners of celebrities. With a little top-tier athlete pay and business income on the side, the family has learned to have income streams available in case disaster strikes on any one front.More than the annual income, the couple’s portfolio includes hard assets and long-term brand equity. The family spends most of their time in Florida at their luxury home, planned for seclusion and comfort. They have plenty of luxury cars, travel, and personal investments in their portfolio, but the biggest asset is still Roman, a worldwide entertainment brand that will only continue to appreciate in value.Part of that reputation also comes from their Anoaʻi wrestling legacy. Roman Reigns is part of one of the most storied families in wrestling history, and that lineage adds to endorsement and merchandise appeal. Licensing deals and media opportunities, even when his in-ring career eventually comes to a halt, are sure to ensure cash flow.","Roman reigns and galina becker are among the richest couples in professional wrestling.

Oracle’s risky AI bet

Oracle cofounder Larry Ellison has now seen an unprecedented $50 billion wiped off his net worth in less than forty days this year, as per Bloomberg Billionaires Index. Ellison’s fortune stood at $199 billion by Wednesday’s (February 4) close, down sharply from $247 billion at the start of January. A single-day slump of 5% in Oracle’s stock erased about $9 billion from this wealth, deepening the decline.The round in software stocks was triggered by Anthropic’s release of plugins for its Claude Cowork AI agent, which can easily automate corporate tasks in legal, scales, finance, marketing and data analysis. Investors now fear that such tools could lead to reduction in the demand for external software from established giants such as Adobe, Salesforce, Intuit and Atlassian. Shares of all these companies tumbled earlier this week before staging a particle rebound, but Oracle’s loses remained steep.Ellison was not along in facing the sharp decline in net worth. Along with him, Tesla CEO Elon Musk also saw his net worth fall by around $11 billion, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg lost around $8 billion. On the other hand, other tech leaders like Larry Page, Sergey Brin, Jeff Bezos and Jensen Huang each shed around $5 billion as the stocks of the companies dropped by at least 2%.For those unaware, Oracle has aggressively positioned itself as an important player in the AI boom, the company has signed deals with Nvidia and OpenAI in order to offer data centers powering next-generation technology. However, its heavy spending and increasing debt have raised concerns among analysts. The company’s remaining performance obligations — contracted sales not yet recognized as revenue — surged 438% year-over-year to $523 billion as of November 30, nearly ten times its annual revenue of $53 billion.Critics believe that Oracle may be overspending. Popular American investor Michael Burry has publicly bet against Oracle. Burry has warned that the company’s debt-fueled expansion tied to AI contracts was unnecessary, calling the moves “hard to explain” and suggesting that “ego” might be driving decisions.","Ellison's fortune stood at $199 billion by wednesday’s (february 4) close, down sharply from $247 billion at the start of january.

Why Amazon is shutting down Amazon Go and Fresh stores

Amazon recently announced that it is shutting down its Amazon Fresh supermarket chain. The decision of the company to shut down the Amazon Fresh stores will lead to thousands of job cuts across the US. Last week, the e-commerce major announced that it will close around 60 Fresh stores which will put an end to the effort of six-years. As reported by Business Insider, the WARN notices filed in various states confirm the sale of layoffs. As aper the filling, in California only the company will shut down 20 Fresh stores which will affect around 3,900 workers. Most Fresh locations closed to the public on February 1, though California stores will remain open until mid-March due to state law.As Amazon is shutting down the Fresh stores, it has outlined two main options for the affected employees. The company is giving a choice to the employees in which they can either choose the severance pay or can take transfer within the company. The workers will continue to receive their normal pay and benefits for 90 days after the closure announcement, or until April 28. The compensation offered by the company will be based on either the minimum pay for their employee class of their average hours worked over the past 60 days whichever is higher.The report further adds that employees who do not secure another role within the company by late April will then receive severance packages, calculated as one week of pay for every six months of service at Amazon Fresh. Workers are guaranteed a minimum of four weeks’ pay, with the possibility of up to 20 weeks depending on tenure.For those seeking to remain within Amazon, the company is encouraging Fresh workers to apply for similar positions at Whole Foods Stores or Amazon grocery warehouse via its internal A to Z portal. An Amazon spokesperson said: “All affected employees will have the opportunity to apply for open roles within Amazon where available, and we’re providing career transition services to help them explore options.”Amazon Fresh associates typically earned between $16 and $20 per hour, according to data from job site Indeed. Their responsibilities ranged from picking delivery orders to handling checkout operations.Amazon Go and Fresh stores were introduced as Just Walk Out technology, but they struggled to establish a distinctive customer experience and sustainable economic model. On the other hand, Whole Food Market acquired in 2017 by Amazon say strong growth with sales rising more than 40% in recent years. Also, Amazon’s online grocery business also witnessed a surge with perishable grocery sales through Same-Day Delivery growing 40x since January 2025, making fresh groceries one of the most-ordered categories on its platform.","Amazon recently announced that it is shutting down its amazon fresh supermarket chain.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai isn't buying the panic. During the company's earnings call, Pichai pushed back against the market hysteria triggered by Anthropic's new AI plugins, calling it overblown. AI is ""an enabling tool,"" he said, just as it has been for Google 's own products—Search, YouTube and others. Companies ""seizing the moment"" will find the same opportunity ahead, he added.His comments come as software stocks worldwide nurse heavy losses. Anthropic's Claude Cowork plugins, wiped out roughly $285 billion from software, legal tech and financial services stocks in a single session. Analysts dubbed it a 'SaaSpocalypse'. Pichai's view? The scramble is overdone.Pichai isn't alone in questioning the market reaction. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang was even more direct at a Cisco event, calling the selloff ""the most illogical thing in the world."" His take: AI will use existing software tools, not reinvent them. ""Would you use a screwdriver or invent a new screwdriver?"" he asked. Huang added that Nvidia itself has adopted such tools extensively, freeing up employees to focus on designing chips and computer systems.Software company executives have also pushed back, arguing they do far more than just build code. Their offerings include data management and purpose-built solutions that are difficult to replicate, especially for enterprises outside the tech world like retail and oil and gas.Anthropic released 11 open-source plugins for Claude Cowork, its agentic AI assistant for non-technical professionals. Most covered standard enterprise functions—sales, marketing, finance, customer support. But the legal plugin rattled nerves. It automates contract review, NDA triage, compliance checks and legal briefings.Morgan Stanley analyst Toni Kaplan called it ""a sign of intensifying competition"" that could hurt big players in the legal space. The fallout was swift. Thomson Reuters and RELX both closed down around 15%. LegalZoom crashed nearly 20%. Indian IT stocks weren't spared—Infosys ADRs slipped 5.5%, Wipro fell nearly 5%.The concern isn't just about legal workflows. There's a dawning realisation that AI tools can now do far more than most non-techies realise. With relatively simple prompts, they can take over a user's computer, write software, analyse stock market data, manage emails and countless other tasks. People have taken to social media describing how they built their first software program without ever learning to code. Shopify's CEO built software that could interpret his recent MRI.Meta's CFO Susan Li told investors last week that the company has seen a 30% year-over-year increase in output per engineer driven by AI coding tools. Power users have seen an 80% boost.Anthropic's numbers back up the concern. Claude Code hit $1 billion in annualised recurring revenue by November, months after launch. The company is reportedly raising $20 billion at a $350 billion valuation. Jefferies noted that OpenAI is losing corporate ground to Claude, with enterprises now making up 80% of Anthropic's business.Pichai and Huang are betting the panic subsides. Wall Street isn't so sure yet.","Google ceo sundar pichai and nvidia ceo jensen huang dismiss market panic over ai plugins, calling it overblown.

Streamer Maya Higa calls out bizarre reality of her image turned into a Twitch-wide emote without her approval,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/streamer-maya-higa-calls-out-bizarre-reality-of-her-image-turned-into-a-twitch-wide-emote-without-her-approval/articleshow/127974600.cms,"Maya Higa was stunned during a February livestream after discovering that an animated laughing emote featuring her face has been widely used across Twitch via 7TV for years. Believing it was limited to her channel, she learned it appears in over 4,000 channels. Though surprised and critical of the emote, she ultimately laughed it off and accepted its popularity.

Maya Higa reacts in disbelief as her laughing face spreads across Twitch





Maya Higa did not wake up expecting to question her own internet legacy. Yet during a recent February livestream, the Twitch creator stumbled onto a discovery that left her staring at chat in disbelief. For years, an animated laughing emote built from her face has been circulating across Twitch through the 7TV extension. The twist is simple and shocking. She had no idea it was being used far beyond her own channel.The moment unfolded live. Higa noticed her face pop up in another streamer’s clip and paused. “I saw a clip from Julia’s stream and I saw my face in it,” she explained on stream. “I was like, ‘wait, I thought that was just me because it’s my channel.’” What she assumed was an inside joke within her community had quietly spread to thousands of channels.As viewers filled her chat with explanations, the scale of the situation became clear. The emote, hosted through 7TV, is reportedly enabled in more than 4,000 Twitch channels. That number alone was enough to leave her stunned. The animated “lmao” reaction, which features her laughing expression, had effectively taken on a life of its own.Her chat defended it as iconic. Higa disagreed. “It’s not even good,” she remarked. “It’s not even a good emote. I feel like that’s not a good one… is this my claim to fame?” The comment drew laughs, but it also highlighted a deeper issue that creators increasingly face on platforms like Twitch. Third party extensions allow images and inside jokes to travel fast. Sometimes they travel without clear permission.Still, Higa chose not to escalate the situation. After processing the surprise, she softened her reaction. “Is that not crazy? Why?” she said, before shrugging it off. “If people like it, I’m glad.”Her response reflects the complicated balance streamers walk today. Digital culture moves quickly. Memes spread faster than their origins. For Maya Higa, what began as a personal emote quietly evolved into a cross channel staple. And she only found out by accident, live in front of thousands watching.","Maya higa was stunned when she found her face in an animated laughing emote.

Amazon's AWS CEO does not agree with Elon Musk and Sundar Pichai 'Space solution' for data centres; says: It is just not ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/amazons-aws-ceo-does-not-agree-with-elon-musk-and-sundar-pichai-space-solution-for-data-centres-says-it-is-just-not-/articleshow/128009155.cms,"AWS CEO Matt Garman has deemed space-based data centres uneconomical due to exorbitant launch costs and insufficient rocket capacity. This contrasts with Elon Musk and Sundar Pichai's ambitious plans for orbital AI infrastructure, citing terrestrial power limitations. While Google aims for test launches in 2027, Garman highlights the immense practical hurdles.

“It is just not economical,”

What are AWS CEO Matt Garman ’s concerns about AI data centres in space

“There are not enough rockets to launch a million satellites yet, so we're, like, pretty far from that. If you think about the cost of getting a payload in space today, it's massive,”

What Sundar Pichai and Elon Musk said about AI data centres in space

“36 months or less. Maybe 30 months.”

“harder to scale on the ground than it is to scale in space”.

“about five times the effectiveness”

“day-night cycle, seasonality, clouds, or an atmosphere.”

“the atmosphere alone results in about a 30% loss of energy”

“they’re quite reliable past a certain point.”

“At Google, we are always proud of taking moon shots,""

one of our moon shots is how do we one day have data centres in space so that we can better harness the energy from the sun?”

“put these data centres in space closer to the sun”

“first step in 2027.”

“We'll send tiny racks of machines and have them in satellites, test them out, and then start scaling from there. But there's no doubt to me that a decade or so away will be viewing it as a more normal way to build data centres,”

Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman has dismissed the feasibility of space-based data centres. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, Garman called the concept uneconomical in a recent interview. His comments undermine the huge confidence shown by tech leaders, including SpaceX CEO Elon Musk and Google CEO Sundar Pichai.Garman said at the Cisco AI Summit in San Francisco. To explain his distrust, he cited the high cost of launching payloads into orbit and insufficient rocket capacity to support the infrastructure required for orbital data centres, Reuters reported.This comes as both Musk and Pichai have shared their ambitions to build artificial intelligence (AI) training data centres in space to reduce dependence on Earth’s resources.Last month, Musk announced the merger of SpaceX and xAI. One reason for the move is to establish a support system for the development of data centres in outer space. In a memo, Musk said it will be critical because ""global electricity demand for AI simply cannot be met with terrestrial solutions.""In November 2025, Google announced Project Suncatcher. This is the Pichai-led company’s orbital data centre initiative, which could begin test launches as early as next year.Garman pointed towards the practical barriers that make the concept ‘impossible’ even in the coming years.he said, as per the Reuters report.The debate over space-based computing facilities has emerged as AI’s rapid expansion creates demands for computing power and cooling that challenge traditional land-based data centres, prompting cloud computing companies to explore alternative solutions.In a recent Dwarkesh podcast, Musk said that the cheapest place to deploy AI would be in space. He suggested that this could happen withinCiting limits on terrestrial power generation, Musk argued that it isHe said space-based solar panels offerbecause there is noHe added thatand that batteries would not be needed for these data centres, as they’ll be solar-powered. Discussing hardware, Musk noted that once GPUs pass early testing,In a recent Fox News interview, Pichai discussed Google’s plans to begin testing space-based data centres in 2027, with the goal of positioning computing infrastructure closer to the sun for better energy access.Pichai said. He noted that “He revealed that the company wants toand will take ahe explained.Apart from SpaceX and Google, several startups are developing designs for space-based data centres. The company claim that these data centres will address challenges faced by land-based facilities, including heat management.

UAE: Sheikh Hamdan inaugurates driverless RT6 taxi operations in Dubai,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/middle-east/uae-sheikh-hamdan-inaugurates-driverless-rt6-taxi-operations-in-dubai/articleshow/127971112.cms,"Sheikh Hamdan launched driverless RT6 taxi operations in Dubai, paving the way for public service in 2026/Image: Dubai Media Office





Dubai has formally launched the operational phase of fully autonomous RT6 taxi vehicles, marking a major step in the emirate’s push to integrate advanced artificial intelligence into its transport network.The launch was led by Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Crown Prince of Dubai, Deputy Prime Minister, Minister of Defence, and Chairman of the Executive Council of Dubai. Sheikh Hamdan travelled in one of the autonomous taxis to the venue of the World Government Summit at Madinat Jumeirah, demonstrating the readiness of the technology to operate in real urban conditions on roads open to live traffic. The milestone clears the path for the public launch of the service in the first quarter of 2026.During the journey, Sheikh Hamdan was briefed on the vehicle’s operating system, which relies on artificial intelligence, advanced sensing technologies, and autonomous decision-making to ensure safe and seamless mobility. The RT6 vehicle, developed by Baidu Apollo Go, represents the sixth generation of autonomous taxi technology and has been designed for large-scale deployment.It is equipped with more than 40 sensors, including high-precision LiDAR, multi-band radars, and advanced cameras, allowing it to perceive its surroundings accurately, respond to changing traffic conditions, and comply fully with transport safety standards and traffic regulations.The system is supported by a sophisticated software ecosystem that integrates real-time data, high-definition maps, and deep learning algorithms, enabling smooth interaction with intersections, pedestrians, and other vehicles. The technology draws on extensive global experience, with Baidu Apollo Go vehicles having completed more than 150 million kilometres of safe driving and over 10 million autonomous trips across several cities.The initiative is the result of cooperation between the Roads and Transport Authority and Baidu Apollo Go, following discussions held during the World Governments Summit 2025. Within around 10 months, the partnership progressed from planning to live operations, reflecting Dubai’s regulatory efficiency and smart infrastructure readiness.As part of the expansion, Baidu Apollo Go has opened its first autonomous vehicle operations and control centre outside China at Dubai Science Park. Spanning 2,000 square metres, the facility manages daily operations, monitoring, software updates, maintenance, and safety testing. The company plans to expand its autonomous fleet in Dubai to more than 1,000 vehicles in the coming years, reinforcing the emirate’s ambition to lead the future of smart and sustainable mobility.","Sheikh hamdan launched driverless rt6 taxi operations in dubai, paving the way for public service in 2026.

"Is Trump's Gold Card illegal? Lawsuit says scientists, engineers waiting in queues while the rich get entry",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/is-trumps-gold-card-illegal-lawsuit-says-scientists-engineers-waiting-in-queues-while-the-rich-gets-entry/articleshow/127917594.cms,"Who qualifies for EB-1, EB-2 visas?





A lawsuit has challenged Trump's Gold Card visa program, calling it an illegal fast lane for wealthy foreigners, irrespective of merit while researchers and scientists are waiting in the backlogged queue. The lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court in Washington, asked the judge to block the program as it prioritizes wealth over intellect or ability and bypasses Congress in the process.The Gold Card program promises permanent residency in exchange for payments of at least $1 million, like the EB-1 and EB-2 visas. In EB category visas, the applicants have to create jobs in the US but Gold Card visa program gives a waiver to the applicants from that criteria as they are 'gifting' the government a specific amount of money.“Rather than reserving those visas for the world’s best and brightest, the Gold Card program converts those visas into revenue-generating commodities sold to the highest bidder,” the lawsuit by a coalition of immigrants, labor unions and academic organizations argued.People with extraordinary ability qualify for an EB-1 visa showing sustained national or international acclaim and achievements that have been recognized in their field.One must intend to continue to work in this field and show that you will substantially benefit the United States in the future.The lawsuit noted that none of these categories created by Congress includes a million-dollar pay and play option and there is a separate visa category for that. EB-5 was specifically created by Congress to spur investment in the US and this category requires applicants to invest about $1 million in a new commercial enterprise for at least two years, but it also has other, more stringent requirements, including specifications as to where such investments must be made.“If you look at the statute, you can tell Congress made some pretty deliberate decisions about how they wanted to structure the availability of these visas,” said Sarah Wilson, a partner at the law firm Colombo & Hurd and one of the lawyers who brought the suit. Wilson's firm was joined by the Democracy Defenders Fund, a nonprofit that challenged Trump administration on a number of fronts.","A lawsuit has challenged trump's gold card visa program, calling it an illegal fast lane for wealthy foreigners.

H-1B visa fee is here to stay: Immigration attorney says employees should hire through L-1 visa to bypass $100K,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/h-1b-visa-fee-is-here-to-stay-immigration-attorney-says-employees-should-hire-through-l-1-visa-to-bypass-100k/articleshow/128007658.cms,"What is L-1 visa?

H-1B Visa Shake-Up Fuels Anti-Indian Campaigns as Donald Trump's Policy Reshapes US Hiring





The H-1B cap pre-registration opens March 4 and will continue till March 19, the USCIS has already announced. This is the first time that the employers will have to make a payment of $100K for each H-1B applicant who is not present in the US at the time of the selection and petition filing. The visa fee announced by the Donald Trump administration was legally challenged but there was no ruling or stay on it which means companies this year have to shell out the money.In the latest podcast of Murthy Law Firm, attorney Anna Stepanova said that companies now have to broaden their search as they can't solely depend on H-1B. Stepanova said L-1 visa programs also allow companies to hire from outside the country but there are some conditions. And this may require some planning and infrastructure, which companies may not have this year but going forward L-1 visa program can be an avenue for companies to bypass the $100,000 H-1B fee.L-1 visa is a non-immigrant visa used by multinational companies to transfer high-level managers from overseas to the US. There are two types of L-1 visas. L-1A visas are for multinational managers and executives and L-1B visas are for employees with specialized knowledge.But the main catch is that the non-US company where these applicants must have worked before outside the US must be related to the petitioning US entity (i.e. , a subsidiary, affiliate, etc.) and must provide USCIS with documentary proof of this relationship.Stepanova said that L-1 visa program can be an excellent entry point in the present situation but it is not the universal solution. L-1 employees can switch to H-1B after coming to the US and can also apply for a Green Card if all the requirements are fulfilled.
