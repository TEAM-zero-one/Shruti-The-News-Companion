Shift to alternative fuel trucks: Nitin Gadkari,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/shift-to-alternative-fuel-trucks-nitin-gadkari/articleshow/122103000.cms,"NEW DELHI: Road transport and highways minister Nitin Gadkari on Thursday urged vehicle manufacturers and logistics companies to opt for trucks that run on alternative fuels rather than diesel-fuelled ones to cut down pollution, reduce logistics costs, and decrease India's dependence on imported fossil fuel.""My appeal to you all is - don't go for diesel trucks, think about alternative fuel and biofuel. It's economically viable,"" Gadkari said, while addressing industry leaders. He added that govt is encouraging the use of alternative fuels such as biodiesel, ethanol, hydrogen, and others.On the need to promote the use of alternative fuel, the minister said India spends around Rs 22 lakh crore on import of fossil fuel. ""It's an economic challenge and impacts our environment as well... By building better roads and using alternative fuel, we can bring down the logistics cost to a single digit of 9%. We are confident of achieving this by year-end. That will create great opportunities for our industry, manufacturing activities, and exports,"" Gadkari said at Mahindra Logistics presents ET Edge Supply Chain Management Fest 2025.He said automobile majors are now manufacturing electric trucks and these will be launched soon, adding that his ministry is planning to have ""flash charging"" electric trucks on the Delhi-Jaipur and Delhi-Amritsar corridors.

NEW DELHI: The International Space Station welcomed its first Indian aboard with Shubhanshu Shukla floating out among hugs and cheers.The recently launched spacecraft, Grace, the fifth in the Dragon series, successfully performed a soft docking with the International Space Station at 16.01 IST while passing over the North Atlantic Ocean on Thursday.Shukla has become the second Indian to travel to space, nearly four decades after Rakesh Sharma’s historic flight in 1984. Accompanying him on the Axiom-4 mission are Slawosz Uznanski-Wisniewski, marking Poland’s return to space since 1978, and Tibor Kapu, the first Hungarian astronaut in 45 years. The crew lifted off from Nasa 's Kennedy Space Center on Wednesday.: It is India’s indigenous human spaceflight programme expected to launch by 2027.

He’s also studying tardigrades to understand survival mechanisms in extreme conditions. These experiments aim to develop sustainable space food systems, ensure astronaut well-being, and strengthen life support strategies for future Indian space missions.Nasa and Isro are set to launch the $1.5 billion NISAR satellite in July from India’s Satish Dhawan Space Centre. This advanced Earth-observing mission will use high-precision radar to monitor surface changes around the clock, providing crucial data on farming, climate, natural disasters, and more.Most Earth-observing satellites are limited by daylight and clear weather, making them less effective in cloudy or nighttime conditions. The Nasa-Isro NISAR mission addresses this gap with advanced radar technology that allows 24/7, all-weather imaging. This will enable more accurate and consistent monitoring of natural disasters, environmental shifts, and farming trends.With its global applications, NISAR is expected to be a game-changer for scientists, farmers, and disaster response teams worldwide.","Shubhanshu shukla has become the second indian to travel to space, nearly four decades after rakesh sharma’s historic flight in 1984.

The post shared the H-1B requirements of other companies, including Amazon, NVIDIA, Cisco, Goldman Sachs, Oracle, Apple etc.The post by investigative journalist Amanda Louise noted that despite tech layoffs, H-1B demand hasn't slowed down.""Microsoft just cut thousands of American workers...yet they’ve already requested 14,181 more H-1B workers this year, and it’s only Q2,"" the post noted. ""If AI is the reason Americans are being let go, why are companies still asking for hundreds of thousands of foreign tech workers? Something doesn’t add up."" the post added.Social media users reacted to the post, starting the ongoing debate over H-1Bs eating up American jobs at a lower price. ""AI: Another Indian,"" one comment read. ""The obvious answer is the H1B system has ALWAYS only been about importing workers to drive down the wages of tech workers. This is why both parties, all the billionaires, and all the CEO’s agree on this issue, they don’t care about America - they only care about cheap workers!"" one user wrote.""Any company that is firing people shouldn't be allowed to apply for H1B visas.

Microsoft sued by authors for allegedly using pirated books to train AI model,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/microsoft-sued-by-authors-for-allegedly-using-pirated-books-to-train-ai-model/articleshow/122088854.cms,"Authors accuse Microsoft of copyright infringement

Lawsuit demands damages and a court injunction

Legal backdrop: A turning point in AI copyright battles

Microsoft yet to respond publicly

A growing challenge for the AI industry





A group of prominent authors, including Pulitzer Prize winner Kai Bird and New Yorker writer Jia Tolentino, has filed a lawsuit against Microsoft, accusing the tech giant of illegally using pirated versions of their books to train its AI model known as “Megatron. ” Filed in a New York federal court on June 25, the suit claims that Microsoft copied nearly 200,000 copyrighted works without permission to develop AI systems that mimic the authors’ unique writing styles, themes, and voices. This marks another major legal challenge in the growing debate over AI training and copyright law.The plaintiffs allege that Microsoft used a massive dataset of pirated digital books to train Megatron, a generative AI model designed to produce human-like text. According to the complaint, the AI’s ability to replicate the tone, syntax, and narrative patterns of copyrighted works demonstrates a clear violation of intellectual property rights. The authors argue that their creative output was exploited to build a product that competes with them in the marketplace, without their consent or compensation.The writers are seeking statutory damages of up to $150,000 per infringed work, along with a court order to block Microsoft from continuing its alleged unauthorised use of their materials.While the exact number of infringed titles remains unclear, the plaintiffs claim that thousands of authors’ works may have been used without licence or attribution. The case could set a precedent for how courts handle AI training involving copyrighted content.This lawsuit comes just one day after a California judge ruled that AI firm Anthropic may have made “fair use” of copyrighted material in training but could still be liable for using pirated versions of books. It was the first US decision to address the legality of using copyrighted texts in generative AI development. The Microsoft case adds further momentum to a wave of lawsuits from writers, artists, and media outlets challenging how their work is used by tech companies.According to Reuters, Microsoft has not issued an official response to the allegations. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment when contacted by reporters. Meanwhile, legal observers say this case will be closely watched for its implications on the future of AI development and intellectual property rights.Tech firms including Meta, OpenAI, and Anthropic have all faced similar legal scrutiny in recent time. The central argument from the companies is that using public data for AI training qualifies as “fair use” under US copyright law. However, rights holders argue that this approach undermines creators' control and devalues their work. As AI models become increasingly sophisticated, courts should define clearer boundaries around what constitutes ethical and legal data usage.",Authors accuse microsoft of copyright infringement.

Bumble layoffs continue as dating app announces 30% job cuts globally,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bumble-layoffs-continue-as-dating-app-announces-30-job-cuts-globally/articleshow/122073256.cms,"What the company has to say



Bumble’s latest layoffs mark second major cut in 2 years



Dating app giant Bumble has announced that it will lay off approximately 240 employees, representing 30% of its global workforce. Despite the significant staff reduction, shares of the company surged by 16% in premarket trading following the news, reports said.According to news agency Reuters, the company anticipates incurring non-recurring charges between $13 million and $18 million for employee severance, benefits, and related expenses, primarily in the third and fourth quarters of 2025.Bumble expects these layoffs to result in annual cost savings of around $40 million, which it plans to reinvest into key areas like product and technology development.Bumble also raised its second-quarter revenue forecast to a range of $244 million to $249 million, an increase from its previous outlook of $235 million to $243 million.A Bumble spokesperson said that the layoffs were “not made lightly.”“Our focus now is on moving forward in a way that strengthens our core business, continues to serve our members effectively, and positions us for future growth,” the spokesperson said, according to CNBC.Bumble’s job cuts are part of a reconfiguration of its “operating structure to optimise execution on its strategic priorities.”This latest job cuts follows a previous significant reduction in February of last year (2024), when the company laid off around 350 employees, representing 37% of its workforce. The 2024 layoffs followed a disappointing first-quarter revenue and a challenging economic environment characterised by a slowdown in user spending.At the time, Bumble stated its intention to “reduce its global workforce by approximately 350 roles to better align its operating model with future strategic priorities and to drive stronger operating leverage.”Bumble joins a growing list of tech giants, including Microsoft , Amazon, and Intel, that have cited various reasons for workforce reductions this year, contributing to a broader trend of significant shifts in the sector.","Bumble has announced that it will lay off approximately 240 employees, representing 30% of its global workforce.

The Art of Resilience

The Art of Focus

In a moment that appealed to seekers of spirituality as well as tech enthusiasts, there was an unforgettable exchange between Google CEO Sundar Pichai and ISKCON monk Gauranga Das at the India Global Forum 2025 in London. The discussion between them, which had started lively with a jocular remark about being youthful, soon turned into an introspective discussion on the stark contrast between corporate stress and spiritual tranquility.Gauranga Das, a graduate from IIT Bombay, who now heads programs in sustainable living and spiritual education, used the moment to highlight some of the most pressing concerns of our digital times - mental health and the increasing digital addiction epidemic.The difference between these two IIT graduates was more than physical or professional; it was philosophical. While one sits at the head of one of the most influential tech giants in the world, the other has dedicated his life to leading people to inner understanding and spiritual direction. The meeting wasn't merely a reunion; it was a comparison of two radically different directions based on the same intellectual heritage. It was an effective metaphor for the decisions contemporary society must make today: progress without equilibrium, or innovation backed by internal wellness.Gauranga Das and Sundar Pichai, though having started at the same time at IIT, followed different career paths early on in life. Pichai went into technology and became the CEO of Google, a company that is at the heart of the digital revolution. Das instead went down the path of spiritual discovery and service, becoming an ISKCON member and dedicating himself to bringing ancient wisdom into modern settings.Their meeting at the India Global Forum 2025 was noticed when Pichai noted the way young Gauranga Das looked compared to his age. Das responded with an answer that went viral instantly for its simplicity and profundity:This one sentence highlighted a wider discussion regarding what it means to live from purpose rather than performance. It also spawned a wider debate regarding how spiritual tools can assist with coping with rising levels of stress inflicted as a result of round-the-clock digital interaction.In his address to the forum, Gauranga Das reported shocking statistics regarding digital addiction, specifically social media. Based on the information he provided, more than 230 million individuals globally are addicted to social media. In India alone, 70% of adolescents spend as much as seven hours per day on the net, a figure that indicates increasing worry for parents, teachers, and mental health professionals.Das linked these figures to the wider problem of declining mental health worldwide. Referring to world trends, he identified that one in seven individuals is presently suffering from some sort of mental health difficulty. These are anxiety, depression, sleep disorders, and chronic stress; maladies that are increasingly being attributed to excessive exposure to digital content and a mindfulness deficit in daily life.This was not simply an attack on technology, but a call to awaken to how we engage with it. Das leveraged the platform to promote a more holistic digital life, one that includes frequent breaks, mindful use, and spiritual anchoring.Gauranga Das is not only a monk who has spiritual wisdom; he is also an engineer who has been trained and who has a deep understanding of how technology functions and how it may affect human psychology. This makes him uniquely qualified in matters that lie at the interface between science and spirituality.Das is also a senior member of the Governing Body Commission of ISKCON and the director of Govardhan Ecovillage (GEV), a green living community that was established under the inspiration of Radhanath Swami. GEV is not only an ashram, it is a widely acclaimed model of how to apply ancient wisdom to modern sustainability practices. It won the UN World Tourism Organization Award in 2017, and it is also accredited with key United Nations organisations such as UNEP, ECOSOC, UNCCD, and CBD.Under Das's stewardship, GEV has turned into an exemplar of the way communities can be in harmony with nature yet maintain essential spiritual principles. It should not be astonishing that numerous young professionals, such as engineers, physicians, and policy makers, now journey to the Ecovillage for leadership training and retreats.Aside from his work in the Ecovillage, Gauranga Das also heads the Govardhan School of Public Leadership, an institution that prepares wannabe civil servants of India. The founder created the school to develop resilient leaders imbued with ethical values by the integration of Vedic wisdom alongside contemporary public policy training.Das also leads the Bhaktivedanta Research Centre, where ancient manuscripts are kept, translated, and analysed in academic contexts. This centre offers postgraduate studies in philosophy and comparative religion, providing students access to systems of knowledge that are both ancient and extremely useful today. The curriculum combines ancient insights with modern administrative frameworks, helping students navigate complexity, uncertainty, and moral dilemmas in real-world governance and social impact roles.Through such platforms, Das prioritises staying resilient, focused, and mentally clear; qualities that are typically undervalued in demanding corporate settings but are key to sustained success and satisfaction.To make spiritual insights more common, Gauranga Das has written two influential books:Both books borrow from scriptures such as the Bhagavad Gita but touch on very contemporary issues like office burnout, distraction, and individual discontentment. These books have spoken to spiritual seekers as well as working professionals seeking down-to-earth, real-life counsel on surviving life's stress.In interviews and talks, Das has consistently emphasised that spiritual tools are not exclusive to monks or renunciants. They are equally relevant to CEOs, students, and anyone navigating the complexities of modern life.","Sundar pichai's iit batchmate gauranga das who turned'monk' looks younger than him; his reason: 'you deal with google, i deal with god' 70% of indian teens spend 7 hours online: iskcon monk warns of mental health fallout.

America contributed the largest share of the total revenue

Accenture, a global IT services and consulting giant with a significant workforce in India, reported an 8% year-on-year revenue increase to $7.7 billion for its March-May 2025 quarter, driven by strong demand for AI-related services. The Ireland-based company, which operates on a September-August fiscal calendar, noted a positive 0.5% foreign exchange impact on its quarterly revenues.The company raised the lower end of its full-year revenue growth forecast to 6-7% in local currency, up from 5-7%, reflecting confidence in its performance. However, challenges persisted, with gross margin dipping to 32.9% from 33.4% a year earlier and a record quarterly headcount reduction of 10,337, bringing its global workforce to approximately 790,000. Despite a $2.15 billion year-on-year increase in generative AI (GenAI) bookings for the first nine months of FY25, overall bookings fell by $1.75 billion compared to the same period in FY24.Accenture continues to invest heavily in AI, growing its data and AI workforce to 75,000 and targeting 80,000 by the end of FY26. Speaking during the earnings call, CEO Sweet said: “We are a leader in GenAI, achieving another milestone quarter with $1.5 billion in bookings and over $700 million in revenues"". She highlighted total GenAI bookings of $4.1 billion and revenues of $1.8 billion for the year to date.The America led regional performance, contributing $8.97 billion to total revenue, followed by Europe, the Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) with $6.23 billion, and Asia-Pacific with $2.53 billion. New bookings for the quarter totaled $19.7 billion, down 6% in U.S. dollars, with $9.08 billion from consulting services and $10.62 billion from managed services.Accenture’s cash balance stood at $9.6 billion at the end of third quarter. Looking ahead, the company projects Q4 FY25 revenues between $17 billion and $17.6 billion, signalling optimism for continued growth. “We remain focused on being our clients’ reinvention partner of choice, as evidenced by $19.7 billion in bookings, including 30 clients with quarterly bookings exceeding $100 million,” Julie Sweet added, emphasising Accenture’s leadership in large-scale transformations.","Accenture reported an 8% year-on-year revenue increase to $7.7 billion for its march-may 2025 quarter.

Phoebe Gates and Sophia Kianni revealed that they have designed a browser extension which they use to compare clothing prices across 40,000 retail stores. Their methodology uses studying high-performing videos on social media platforms Instagram and TikTok. After this, they make an Excel sheet of all of the videos mentioning their key highlights such as the compelling ""hook,"" the engaging ""middle,"" and the effective ""ending.""After this they use the ChatGPT ‘hack’. Kianni revealed that they use the chatbot to transcribe the viral videos. ChatGPT then analyses these transcripts and try to find out the underlying patterns which help the videos to become viral. Once done Gates and Kianni use this analysis and feed their own descriptions of Phia into ChatGPT, prompting the chatbot to create scripts that mimic the structure of the already viral videos.

Walmart Inc President and CEO Doug McMillon emphasized the company's desire for a level playing field and consistent policies in all countries where it operates, stating that Walmart is well-equipped to navigate the current tariff challenges better than any other retailer. ""We operate in many countries, and we consistently ask for a level playing field everywhere,"" McMillon told the Economic Times when questioned about India. ""We engage with various governments, sharing our views on changes needed to better serve customers, but we don't set the rules—we comply with them.""Talking about the goal for India market, Doug McMillion said, Walmart will announce the next goal for India once it reaches the target of annually sourcing goods worth $10 billion from the country by 2027. He went on to highlight Walmart's preference for local sourcing and job creation, noting, ""We like to buy locally, create jobs, and benefit from shorter lead times, especially for food and consumables."" Media reports suggest that the Trump administration is pushing India to grant full access to its $125 billion e-commerce market for companies like Amazon and Walmart as part of ongoing bilateral trade agreement (BTA) negotiations, expected to conclude by next month. McMillon clarified that Walmart is not directly involved in these government-to-government talks.In India, e-commerce giants like Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart are prohibited from holding inventory or selling directly to consumers, unlike local firms such as Reliance Retail and Tata Group. Doug McMillon stressed the importance of clear and predictable regulations, saying, ""The more things are transparent and consistent, the better it is for business, whether in India or globally.""On the possibility of Flipkart holding inventory in India, McMillon noted, ""We have expertise in inventory management and would be happy if the rules allowed it, but we leave rule-making to others.""Addressing tariffs, Doug McMillon said Walmart's sourcing capabilities give it an edge. ""We've been managing tariffs since 2018, and our experienced merchants can adapt by making different sourcing choices,"" he said. ""We prioritize buying locally to create jobs and reduce lead times, though this is easier for food than general merchandise.""McMillon underscored Walmart's commitment to low prices, stating, ""Keeping the cost of living low is our priority. Low prices are in our DNA, and we aim to maintain a price gap with competitors to deliver value to customers globally.""Regarding India, McMillon expressed optimism about Walmart's sourcing goals, saying, ""We’re on track to source $10 billion annually from India by 2027, with an expanding range of categories.

Protesters Erupt Over Jeff Bezos’ Lavish Venice Wedding Bash, Greenpeace Sends Fiery Message

One of the most-expensive divorce in the history

Sexts that ended Jezz Bezos first marriage

What divorce lawyers say

Billionaire Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the world’s fourth-richest person with a net worth of $223.7 billion, is set to marry longtime girlfriend Lauren Sánchez in a three-day Venetian wedding extravaganza starting June 24, estimated to cost over $10 million. Dubbed the “wedding of the century,” the nuptials have sparked widespread interest, not only for their opulence but also for the intricate legal protections surrounding the union.Bezos and Sanchez, a former news anchor and founder of an aerial production company, announced their engagement in 2023. However, their wedding plans were reportedly delayed from an initial winter 2024 date in Aspen due to prolonged negotiations over a prenuptial agreement, according to The Hollywood Reporter. An insider claimed Bezos’ legal team insisted on finalizing the prenup before proceeding, though Bezos denied the Aspen wedding rumor via a post on Twitter. According to a report in Vanity Fair too, some lingering financial trauma from Bezos' first divorce pushed the couple's wedding by few months.The prenup is a focal point given Bezos’ costly 2019 divorce from MacKenzie Scott, his wife of 25 years and Amazon’s first employee. That split, one of the most expensive in history, saw Scott receive over $38 billion in Amazon shares. e divorce included explosive cheating allegations that accused Bezos of having an affair with now-fiancée Sanchez. The absence of a prenup in Bezos’ first marriage has made legal safeguards a priority this time around.The Venetian celebration marks a new chapter for Bezos and Sánchez, whose relationship began under public scrutiny but has since blossomed into a high-profile romance. As the couple prepares to say “I do,” their legal agreements ensure that Bezos’ vast fortune remains protected, underscoring the complexities of love and wealth at the pinnacle of global finance.Jeff Bezos and his first wife, the novelist MacKenzie Scott, were married back in 1993; Scott is said to have helped get Amazon off the ground, but their 25-year marriage ended in 2019 after the tabloid The Enquirer published leaked sexts between Bezos and Sanchez — revealing their romantic affair. The Bezos-Scott separation became one of the highest-dollar divorces in history, fracturing the pair's fortune and leaving Scott with tens of billions of dollars and Amazon shares.High-profile divorce attorney Robert Cohen, who has represented clients like Melinda French Gates, told Fortune that billionaires like Bezos often seek prenups after experiencing contentious divorces. “They’ve likely been through a nightmare before… and they don’t want to do that again,” Cohen said.Sánchez, who was previously married to Patrick Whitesell until 2019, also signed a prenup in her first marriage, which facilitated a smooth division of assets. She shares two children with Whitesell, while Bezos has four children with Scott.","Amazon founder jeff bezos is set to marry longtime girlfriend lauren sánchez in a three-day venetian wedding extravaganza starting june 24.

Mukesh Ambani, chairman of Reliance Industries , India’s largest private-sector conglomerate, revealed insights into his leadership philosophy and the company’s bold approach to innovation during a recent interview for the Leading Asia series. Speaking to McKinsey, Mukesh Ambani discussed how a clear vision, coupled with the right talent, has helped Reliance grow from a modest textiles business into a global leader in innovation and value creation. The Leading Asia series features in-depth conversations with the region’s most influential leaders, exploring the strategies behind their ambitious goals.Highlighting the company’s willingness to take risks, Ambani pointed to the launch of Reliance Jio as a defining moment. ""We’ve always taken big risks because, for us, scale is important. The biggest risk we have taken so far was Jio. At the time, it was our own money that we were investing, and I was the majority shareholder,"" he said. Despite skepticism from analysts about India’s readiness for advanced digital technology, Ambani invested heavily in Jio, viewing it as a potential game-changer. “In the worst case, we will not earn much return. That’s okay because it’s our own money,” he told his board. “But this will be the best philanthropy we’ve ever done because we will have digitized India and transformed the country.”Ambani said that his leadership idea is rooted in a long-term perspective, inspired by his father’s vision of Reliance as an enduring institution. “You come without anything into this world, and you leave without taking anything with you. What you leave behind is an institution,” he said, recalling his father’s words. With Reliance approaching its golden jubilee in 2027, Ambani expressed confidence that the company will continue to serve India and humanity for a century and beyond.Reflecting on Reliance’s evolution, Ambani noted its ability to adapt to a rapidly changing world. “The Reliance of the 1960s and ’70s is completely different from the Reliance of the 2000s and 2020s,” he said. By challenging traditional business school principles, such as avoiding integration across the value chain, Reliance has seized emerging technological opportunities, often surpassing its existing ventures in scale and impact.","Mukesh ambani, chairman of reliance industries, revealed insights into his leadership philosophy and the company's bold approach to innovation.

Shark Tank India recently posted a teaser of the upcoming fifth season of the show on Instagram. The now viral teaser takes a sly dig at the 70-hour work week comment made by Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy. The promo can be seen mocking the long working hours, but it also draws parallels with Shark Tank India judge Aman Gupta who recently expressed his views on intense work dedication.Earlier this year, Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy suggested that Indians should work for 70 hours a week as this will boost the country's productivity and economy. Now, the new teaser of Shark Tank India show takes a dig at this viewpoint with its new promo.Shark Tank India season five promo released by SonyLiv features fictional company CEOs who are disappointed with their employees starting their own businesses. The voice over in the background urges viewers to “keep working so your millionaire bosses become billionaires,” and warns them not to apply for the fifth season of the show.The teaser simply conveys the message that don’t give up on your dreams for corporate burnout .The new promo of the show aligns with the viewpoints of some of the judges on show. Recently, Shark Tank India judge Namita Thapar publicly criticized the concept of a 70-hour work week. Thapar said that the idea of a 70-hour work week is unsustainable and is not good for the well-being of the professional. She also advocates the ideal of work-life balance . Anupam Mittal, another judge on the show also weighed in with a sarcastic remark about AI potentially eliminating jobs, easing concerns about long work hours.However, not all the judges on the show disagree with this sentiment of long working hours. Recently, Boat co-founder and Shark Tank India judge Aman Gupta acknowledged the significant time he dedicated to building his business, which inevitably meant less time for his family, particularly during his daughter's formative years.Speaking on the podcast Prakhar Ke Pravachan, Gupta said, “I know I have missed out on many things in my daughter’s life. If I look back now, I realise how many events I have missed. However, I am very much okay with it and I don’t regret it at all.” He added, “Had I not missed out on those occasions, my life would have been much different.”However, Gupta mentioned that these sacrifices were important and necessary for him to succeed. ""I'm very much okay with it. I don't regret it at all. Had I not missed out on those important occasions, my life would have been much different,"" he explained. He further added, ""I worked very hard and that is the reason I'm where I am.

Data from Reserve Bank of India, based on financial statements of 3,902 listed non-government non-financial firms, point to a broad-based if uneven recovery-tempered by rising input costs and tightening margins.Manufacturing companies saw sales climb by 6.0%, up from 3.5% the year before. The uptick owed much to strong performances in automobiles, electrical machinery, food and beverages, and pharmaceuticals. Yet, this momentum was offset by contractions in petroleum and metals, particularly iron and steel, reflecting the drag from commodity price volatility and weak global demand.The services sector fared better. Information technology firms, despite navigating global uncertainties, clocked 7.1% growth, up from 5.5%. More striking was the surge in non-IT services, where double-digit growth was underwritten by buoyant telecom, logistics, and trade-related activity.Still, cost pressures loomed large. Manufacturers grappled with a 6.6% rise in raw material costs, and the ratio of such costs to sales edged higher, hinting at tighter operating conditions. Staff expenses too ticked up across the board-by 10% for manufacturers, 4.4% for IT firms, and 12% for non-IT services-suggesting wage pressures in a still-tight labour market. Margins, predictably, suffered.
