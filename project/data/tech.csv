Safety first: Govt mulls mandatory ABS for all two-wheelers above 50cc,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/safety-first-govt-mulls-mandatory-abs-for-all-two-wheelers-above-50cc/articleshow/120653150.cms,"Representative image

NEW DELHI: Government is considering making anti-lock braking systems (ABS) mandatory for all two-wheelers with engine capacity above 50cc. At present, ABS is only required in motorcycles over 125cc. This safety feature helps prevent wheel lock-up during sudden braking, enhancing control and reducing stopping distances, especially on slippery roads.Experts from India and abroad have emphasised the need for this provision, in addition to the mandatory wearing of helmets for all two-wheeler occupants — which is currently enforced, to reduce deaths and serious injuries. Two-wheeler riders are among the most vulnerable road users after pedestrians and cyclists, as they have little to no protection.“Since ABS has been a successful intervention to reduce the risk of road crashes and fatalities involving two-wheelers and fatalities, this should be a feature in all motorised two-wheelers above 50cc,” said David Ward of Global New Car Assessment Programme at a conference on ‘Vehicle and Fleet Safety’ at the Institute of Road Traffic Education (IRTE). Safe technological systems, including ABS for all two-wheelers, cannot be ignored, he added.Road safety expert Rohit Baluja highlighted the need to include two-wheelers in transport planning since they constitute 74% of all vehicles in India and 44% people killed on roads are two-wheeler occupants.“Today, we only talk about putting helmets on two-wheeler riders. Is the helmet the only answer? Has anyone spoken about the transportation planning to reduce the number of these two-wheelers in the country? Two-wheelers are sandwiched between other vehicles due to poor traffic and transport planning... Powered two-wheelers destroy road discipline of all users and there is a need to address their requirement while planning and building roads,” Baluja said. He added that there is a need to have dedicated driving lanes for two-wheelers.President emeritus of International Road Federation, K K Kapila, said two-wheelers are the lifeline of major cities, despite improvement in public transport, and the only solution is to find ways and means to make them safe with use of technology.","Government is considering making anti-lock braking systems (abs) mandatory for all two-wheelers with engine capacity above 50cc.

Shannon Sharpe Lawsuit: Who is Gabriella Zuniga? The OnlyFans star who sued Shannon Sharpe,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/who-is-gabriella-zuniga-the-onlyfans-star-who-sued-shannon-sharpe/articleshow/120578272.cms,"Source - X

Gabriella Zuniga: The woman rumored to be behind the Shannon Sharpe lawsuit



Who is Gabriella Zuniga? A young model with a quiet online past until now

For weeks, the $50 million civil lawsuit against Shannon Sharpe featured a mystery woman simply referred to as “Jane Doe.” But now, internet detectives and a few hip-hop gossip outlets believe they’ve uncovered who she is. Enter Gabbi Zuniga , a 20-year-old OnlyFans model whose name is suddenly at the center of one of the most talked-about legal cases in sports media.Here’s everything we know so far about Zuniga, where this information is coming from, and why the internet believes she’s the woman behind the allegations.The name Gabbi Zuniga first started trending on Twitter and TikTok shortly after news of the Shannon Sharpe lawsuit broke. According to viral posts from hip-hop accounts like WorldStarHipHop , OnSite, and The Neighborhood Talk, Zuniga is being identified as the woman suing Sharpe for rape, emotional abuse, and secretly recording intimate moments.Here’s why the internet believes Gabbi Zuniga is the woman suing Shannon Sharpe: The lawsuit never names the accuser, identifying her only as “Jane Doe,” but social media detectives quickly connected the dots. Screenshots of flirty DMs allegedly linked to Gabbi’s accounts began circulating, and old OnlyFans clips, TikToks, and deleted Instagram posts reportedly showed her in spaces resembling Sharpe’s home or hotel rooms described in the suit.Though the court documents still list the accuser as “Jane Doe”, these online receipts have pushed Gabbi’s name into the spotlight. No one has confirmed this yet, but screenshots of Gabbi’s alleged texts and DMs with Sharpe are circulating online and multiple Reddit and X (formerly Twitter) threads claim she was spotted with Sharpe in LA..Before this legal case, Gabbi Zuniga wasn’t a household name. She reportedly ran a modest OnlyFans account, occasionally posted on TikTok, and goes by the name of @sheiskarli on Instagram. Users claim she previously worked in LA as a fitness model and met Sharpe at a West Hollywood gym in 2023 when she was 20.Now, her name is trending across social media, with hundreds of users analyzing her posts and reposting alleged clips of her and Sharpe together.In civil lawsuits like this especially involving sexual assault—plaintiffs often use the name “Jane Doe” to protect their identity. It’s legal and standard practice. But once the story hits the internet, things can spiral.Gabbi hasn’t publicly confirmed or denied her involvement in the case, and her social media pages are now locked or deleted. Still, the viral naming has led to real-life implications, with online trolls, fans, and media digging into her private life.Sharpe’s legal team, meanwhile, is still treating the case as involving “Jane Doe,” and neither side has commented directly on Gabbi Zuniga by name.Whether or not the internet got it 100% right, the name Gabbi Zuniga is now tied to one of the most explosive sports lawsuits of 2025. From anonymous accuser to viral figure, her identity reveal (or alleged reveal) has added even more layers of drama and speculation to an already chaotic story.Also read - Inside the Shannon Sharpe lawsuit: A full timeline of the sexual assault case, lawyers, leaked videos, and what comes next","The name gabbi zuniga first started trending on twitter and tiktok shortly after news of the shannon sharpe lawsuit broke.

The ₹556-crore project, located at Ballard Pier, marks India’s most ambitious cruise infrastructure development to date.MICT now stands as the country’s largest cruise terminal, with the capacity to handle 10,000 passengers per day and up to one million annually. The facility features the ability to berth five cruise ships at once, accommodating vessels up to 300 metres in length. Designed with international standards in mind, the terminal includes modern immigration counters, retail outlets, spacious waiting lounges, and integrated digital systems for seamless passenger movement.The terminal was developed through a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) involving the Mumbai Port Authority, JM Baxi & Co., and Ballard Pier Port Pvt Ltd. It aligns with the Indian government’s broader “Cruise India Mission” and supports the Sagarmala initiative, aimed at enhancing port-led development.Speaking at the inauguration, Minister Sonowal underscored the terminal’s potential to stimulate economic growth and employment across multiple sectors, including hospitality, transport, and retail. “The opening of MICT is a landmark in India’s maritime journey and a catalyst for the cruise tourism sector,” he stated.A key highlight of MICT is its focus on sustainability. The terminal incorporates eco-friendly design elements and smart infrastructure for energy-efficient and environmentally conscious operations. This makes it not only a gateway for international cruise tourists but also a model for green port development in India.In conjunction with the MICT launch, the Ministry of Ports, Shipping and Waterways announced upcoming maritime infrastructure investments worth ₹5,700 crore at the future Vadhavan Port.

Most apps today have become unusable. They bombard users with irritating notifications, spam messages, and dark patterns, and many are downright scammy.

Without your knowledge, numerous apps on your phone track and harvest extensive data: which apps you've installed, how you use them, the content of your emails and SMS, media on your device, and more.

What's truly disturbing is that some apps track usage not just within their own environment but across other apps too. This means your most personal data is being harvested without your consent and sold to companies for shady targeting purposes.

At @zerodhaonline, we're different. We only request app permissions that are genuinely necessary for functionality. We don't send unnecessary push notifications, messages, or emails. We don't peddle useless financial products or push you to trade for the sake of ""engagement.""

Not doing unto others what we don't want done unto us is deeply rooted in our philosophy.

"Government unveils Rs 23,000-crore electronics components manufacturing scheme to boost domestic production",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/government-unveils-rs-23000-crore-electronics-components-manufacturing-scheme-to-boost-domestic-production/articleshow/120659069.cms,"AI-generated image

NEW DELHI: The Government has released regulations for applications under the Rs 23,000-crore Electronics Components Manufacturing Scheme (ECMS), aimed at boosting domestic value addition in electronics production. Ashwini Vaishnaw Union Electronics and IT Minister revealed that firms with strong local design capabilities and 'six sigma' quality standards will be key evaluation factors. Companies lacking domestic design teams might be “left out” of the “phenomenal change” expected in India's electronics sector over the next five years, according to a report by The Economic Times.Applications for the six-year scheme will open on May 1 through an online portal.The Union Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister, had approved the ECMS earlier this month. The initiative seeks to attract substantial domestic and global investments, develop robust manufacturing capabilities, and integrate Indian companies into Global Value Chains (GVCs).S Krishnan, Secretary of the Electronics and IT Ministry, asserted that the scheme is timely, coinciding with geopolitical shifts that could redefine global value chains. It is expected to increase India's share in global electronics manufacturing from 3 per cent to 8 per cent over six years, according to him.The programme targets Rs 59,350 crore in investments, aims to create 91,600 direct jobs, and projects production worth Rs 4,56,500 crore.It offers a mix of turnover-linked and capital expenditure incentives, depending on component type, with employment generation tied to both incentive structures.ECMS covers sub-assemblies such as display and camera modules, core components like multilayer PCBs and lithium-ion cells, specific bare components including HDI and MSAP PCBs, as well as supply chain infrastructure and manufacturing equipment.Application windows differ: three months for sub-assemblies and bare components, and two years for supply chain and capital equipment categories.Atul Lall, vice chairman and managing director of Dixon Technologies, confirmed plans to invest significantly in at least four component categories under the scheme.Meanwhile, industry bodies highlighted the need for international collaborations and strong state partnerships to strengthen the electronics ecosystem.Additionally, Vaishnaw noted India's electronics production and export growth—both witnessing five- and sixfold increases respectively over the past decade—adding momentum to the ECMS.India’s electronics production has surpassed Rs 11 lakh crore (approximately $129 billion) annually. The country is targeting $300 billion by 2026 and $500 billion by 2030-31 in domestic electronics production Separately, the government announced Bengaluru-based Sarvam AI as the first startup selected to develop an indigenous foundational model under the IndiaAI Mission.Pankaj Mohindroo, chairman of the India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), predicted that states would launch competitive initiatives to attract investments. He cited the mobile industry’s current $62 billion production base, suggesting ECMS will further strengthen India's components and sub-assembly ecosystems.Ashok Chandak, president of SEMI India and the India Electronics and Semiconductor Association (IESA), described the scheme as critical for boosting manufacturing capabilities while complementing the India Semiconductor Mission.The ECMS outlines various investment thresholds by component type, offering turnover-linked incentives for investments between Rs 50 crore and Rs 500 crore, alongside additional capex incentives for selected components.","The government has released regulations for applications under the rs 23,000-crore electronics components manufacturing scheme.

The billboard featured Bezos alongside pop star Katy Perry with a caption that read: ""If you can send Katy Perry to space, you can afford to pay more taxes.""The ad appeared days after Blue Origin — Bezos’ space venture — successfully launched its 11th human spaceflight from West Texas, featuring an all-female crew. The team included Perry, journalist Gayle King, Bezos’ fiancée Lauren Sánchez, former Nasa engineer Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, and producer Keri Flynn. The suborbital flight crossed the Kármán line and lasted around 10 minutes.""You're brave, you're bold… No limitations,"" Perry said ahead of the launch, adding she drew inspiration from astrophysics readings and her role as a mother. “Being a mother just makes you level up with that type of power,” she noted.While Blue Origin celebrated the flight as a historic milestone for women in space , the trip drew criticism online, with some pointing to the juxtaposition of extravagant space missions and tax avoidance claims. One viral post read, “We are literally just asking them to pay their fair share of taxes, which they don’t.”Others, however, defended Bezos. One user commented, “Jeff Bezos is an American and as such pays income taxes to the US, thank you for coming to my TED talk.” Another wrote, “Sending more money to the government is more wasteful than sending money to space.”","Billboard features amazon founder jeff bezos alongside pop star katy perry.

SEOUL: Chinese artificial intelligence app DeepSeek was transferring personal data to a cloud services platform without users' consent while it was still available for download, South Korea 's data protection authority said on Thursday.The Personal Information Protection Commission ( PIPC ) said the information, which included device, network, and user inputs in AI prompts, was transferred to servers at Beijing platform Volcano Engine .DeepSeek's R1 chatbot stunned investors and industry insiders in January with its ability to match the functions of its Western competitors at a fraction of the cost.However, countries including South Korea, Italy and Australia and some US states have questioned DeepSeek's storage of user data and have banned or restricted its use.The PIPC launched an investigation in February and said DeepSeek would no longer be available for download until a review of its personal data collection practices was completed.""Initially, DeepSeek transferred personal data to companies located in China and the United States without obtaining users' consent or disclosing this in the privacy policy at the time the service was launched,"" commission official Nam Seok told reporters.""In particular, it was confirmed that DeepSeek transferred not only device, network, and app information, but also user inputs in AI prompts to Volcano Engine,"" he said.Following the investigation, DeepSeek ""acknowledged it had insufficiently considered Korea 's data protection laws, expressed its willingness to cooperate with the commission, and voluntarily suspended new downloads from domestic app markets"", Nam said.DeepSeek did not immediately respond to a request for comment. It has said that data was collected in ""secure servers located in the People's Republic of China"".The company claims its AI tool was built using less sophisticated chips than its competitors, slashing the cost. The app was downloaded tens of millions of times in just a few weeks after its launch.Volcano Engine is a Beijing-based cloud service platform owned by ByteDance, which is also the parent company of the hugely popular platform TikTok.Asked about the data transfer to Volcano Engine, DeepSeek said it was sent ""for the purpose of addressing security vulnerabilities and improving user interface and experience"", Nam said.","Deepseek's r1 chatbot stunned investors and industry insiders in january with its ability to match the functions of its western competitors at a fraction of the cost.

TOKYO : The first foreigner tapped to head 7-Eleven expressed confidence Friday the Japanese convenience store chain will continue to attract thrifty customers, even in an economic slowdown.But Stephen Hayes Dacus , an American with a Japanese mother, declined to comment on the specifics of the various investment plans now being studied, including an acquisition proposal by Alimentation Couche-Tard of Canada.A special company committee, which he isn't part of, is charged with studying the options ""totally objectively,"" he said.""The process is moving forward very constructively,"" Dacus, who is currently a director, told a small group of reporters at the Tokyo headquarters of Seven & i Holdings Co., which operates 7-Eleven.His appointment as chief executive still needs shareholders' approval, set for May. Seven & i shares have risen more than 2% in the past year.Fluent in Japanese and English, Dacus said he was determined to build a culture of leadership that he's learned to admire from his experience working at Walmart, Uniqlo and other retailers.""If you're not humble, you're not listening to your customers. You're not learning. But if you're not aggressive, you're going to get beat by your competitors,"" he said.Dacus stressed the 7-Eleven chain was growing globally. But the stores were different by nation, and his intent was not to duplicate everywhere the Japanese-style "" conbini ,"" as they are known here.Lowering costs can be delivered with a better supply chain, for instance, leveraging the chain's global reach, while a cheaper recipe for a food item will merely drive customers away, said Dacus.""This business in Japan has been built on innovation,"" he said.While declining to comment on US President Donald Trump's policies, he acknowledged buyers will likely tighten their purse strings in a slowdown.The answer is to be the first choice for where they shop, Dacus said, noting that his mother and Japanese relatives he watched growing up never wasted anything. They would wrap leftover dinner rolls at restaurants in paper to take home, he recalled.""If you want to talk to some tough customers, you go talk to my aunts,"" he said.""Japanese customers are incredibly demanding. That's something that really resonates with me. And that forms the way I think about retail.","Stephen hayes dacus is the first foreigner tapped to head 7-eleven.

India’s GDP growth outlook trimmed to 6.3% as private investment stalls and US tariffs loom: Report,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/indias-gdp-growth-outlook-trimmed-to-6-3-as-private-investment-stalls-and-us-tariffs-loom-report/articleshow/120613489.cms,"AI-generated image

India’s economy is expected to grow at a slower pace in the current fiscal year, weighed down by subdued private sector investment and uncertainty surrounding American tariffs, according to a Reuters survey of economists.The fifth-largest economy in the world is projected to expand at an average rate of 6.3 per cent in FY2024 -25, based on a poll conducted from April 15-24 with participation from 54 economists. While this matches last year’s growth, it marks a slight downgrade from the 6.5 per cent forecast in a March survey. It still remains marginally above the International Monetary Fund’s (IMF) recent projection of 6.2 per cent.However, this represents a significant drop from the 9.2 per cent GDP growth recorded in fiscal year 2023–24, highlighting a slowdown in momentum.Economists say the headline figures mask deeper structural issues, including the economy’s inability to generate enough high-paying jobs for its growing youth population. Despite government-led infrastructure investments, private sector capital expenditure has remained stagnant over the past decade, leaving India operating below its potential.The situation is further complicated by the proposed 26 per cent US tariff on Indian imports - currently suspended for a 90-day window starting April 10 — which has raised concerns despite India’s services-heavy exports to the US.“Middle-class Indians are struggling. Residential building sales, passenger vehicles, and two-wheeler sales have declined. It’s important that domestic policies address the root causes,” said Kunal Kundu, India economist at Société Générale.“India needs a 1991 moment,” he added, referencing the landmark liberalisation campaign led by then-finance minister Manmohan Singh. “The tariff war offers a perfect opportunity to push for structural reforms. Without them, even as the fastest-growing large economy in a low global growth environment, India may fall well short of its long-term ambition to become a developed nation.”In the survey, most economists said US tariffs have had a negative or severely negative impact on business sentiment. Some described the effect as neutral.“Business sentiment has certainly taken a hit — no business wants to make investment decisions in an uncertain and volatile environment. Investment is the most adversely affected component of the economy due to trade tariffs,” said Kanika Pasricha, chief economic advisor at Union Bank of India.She added that sectors previously poised for growth — including renewables, refineries, steel, and cement — may now scale back or delay capital expenditure plans.Meanwhile, with concerns of a potential US recession and India’s consumer inflation staying below the 4 per cent medium-term target for two straight months, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is expected to continue its moderate rate-cutting cycle. The central bank is likely to reduce rates by 25 basis points in June to 5.75 per cent, and possibly conclude the easing cycle in August at 5.50 per cent, according to the survey.“The unexpected drop in inflation... has created greater scope for monetary policy support to growth,” noted Dhiraj Nim, economist at ANZ.For FY2024–25, consumer inflation is projected to average 4.0 per cent, rising slightly to 4.3 per cent in the following fiscal year.This report based on Reuters survey comes days after the World Bank revised its prediction on India's growth to 6.3 per cent for FY 2025-26, cut from its previous estimate of 6.7 per cent.According to the report, as quoted by news agency PTI, ""In India, growth is expected to slow from 6.5 per cent in FY2024-25 to 6.3 per cent in FY 2025-26, as the benefits to private investment from monetary easing and regulatory streamlining are expected to be offset by global economic weakness and policy uncertainty.""The organisation's assessment indicates that India's current fiscal performance fell short of projections, primarily due to reduced private sector investments and unfulfilled public capital expenditure objectives.Read more: World Bank cuts India’s FY26 growth forecast to 6.3% citing global headwinds",The fifth-largest economy in the world is projected to expand at an average rate of 6.3 per cent in fy2024 -25.

Apple's India Plans

Apple aims to significantly increase iPhone production in India as part of its strategy to diversify manufacturing away from China and protect against uncertainties stemming from US-China trade tensions under the Donald Trump administration.Currently, the company produces approximately 40-43 million iPhones annually in India, with about 80% for export markets, according to industry data. Production could increase to 70-80 million units by late 2026, positioning India as the primary iPhone supplier to the United States.The company produces iPhones in India through Foxconn and Tata Electronics , with Tata Electronics having acquired Wistron and Pegatron's facilities in the country.Industry experts indicate this transition could result in India manufacturing nearly 40% of global iPhone sales within the next 18 months, an increase from the present 18-20%.Government officials informed ET they will collaborate with Apple and its suppliers to facilitate this transition, which would substantially strengthen India's electronics manufacturing sector.Also Read | Apple’s China exodus: All US iPhones to be made in India by 2025 ""As per our estimates, Apple has reached a production scale of around 40-43 million iPhones in India for both domestic consumption and exports, amounting to 17-20% of its global shipments in 2024,"" said Navkendar Singh, associate vice president, IDC India.Singh noted that doubling iPhone production in India would require scaling up to 70-80 million units annually, significantly boosting India's expanding electronics manufacturing ecosystem.Apple, having established India as its second global iPhone manufacturing hub, is rapidly increasing its production capacity in this South Asian nation, which also represents the world's second-largest smartphone market.Apple's suppliers exported iPhones worth nearly Rs 1.5 lakh crore in FY25, increasing from Rs 85,000 crore in FY24.Also Read | Goodbye China, Namaste India! Laptop brands shift production as PLI scheme bears fruit, Trump’s tariffs loom large The relocation of iPhone manufacturing will largely depend on India's standing in the evolving geopolitical landscape and the conditions of the proposed US trade agreement. Should the Trump administration adopt a lenient stance towards China, the transition to India could be slower.According to an industry insider, the relocation of global value chains (GVCs) will also depend on whether India implements substantial reforms to tackle ongoing cost inefficiencies and policy uncertainties related to taxes and tariffs, ensuring production doesn't divert from China to countries such as Vietnam.The India Cellular and Electronics Association (ICEA), whose members include Apple and other major electronics companies, indicates that India faces a cost disadvantage of 7% to 7.5% compared to Vietnam and China. Additional streamlining, particularly of crucial sub-assemblies and components, would enhance India's competitive position.A Niti Aayog study on electronics GVCs emphasises the necessity to reduce component tariffs to match China and Vietnam's levels, as current rates disadvantage Indian exports. The study additionally recommends harmonising direct and indirect tax structures to align with competing nations' offerings.Despite India's advantageous position compared to China and Vietnam under Trump's new tariff system, experts suggest that New Delhi must strategically negotiate to secure a beneficial long-term agreement with the US, whilst outmanoeuvring its manufacturing competitors.Also Read | China’s snub to India’s advantage?

India needs stronger veterinary infrastructure and skilled professionals to support its rural economy, Union Minister of State for Fisheries, Animal Husbandry and Dairying S P Singh Baghel said on Saturday.Speaking at a national workshop on the occasion of World Veterinary Day, Baghel described veterinarians as “the backbone of the rural economy” and called for greater collaboration among veterinary professionals, scientists, and public health experts to ensure an integrated health approach, according to an official statement as reported by news agency PTI.India is home to over 536 million livestock, the largest in the world, with nearly 70 per cent of rural households depending on animals for income, food, and livelihood security, he said.The minister emphasized the importance of indigenous livestock breeds, well-suited to local climate conditions and essential for sustainable agricultural systems.
