Deal St: Cognizant inks over $1bn contract with Novartis,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/deal-st-cognizant-inks-over-1bn-contract-with-novartis/articleshow/126473146.cms,".

BENGALURU: Cognizant is learnt to have secured a deal worth over $1 billion from Swiss pharma major Novartis as part of a consolidation contract that includes renewals as well as new scope spanning application services, infrastructure, data and AI-led offerings, people in the know told TOI.This marks the second consecutive billion-dollar deal for Cognizant in less than a year, after it won a large contract from UnitedHealth Group last year. UnitedHealth ranks among Cognizant's biggest customers, supported by a partnership spanning nearly two decades. When TOI reached out, a Cognizant spokesperson said the company is currently in a silent period and had no comment. An email sent to Novartis did not elicit a response until the time of going to press.Those aware of developments said Cognizant's EMEA and APAC teams played a key role in clinching the deal under the leadership of Gagan Syal, head of life sciences for EMEA and APAC at Cognizant.Phil Fersht, CEO of USIT advisory HfS Research, said the rise in half-billion-dollar and larger IT services deals reflects a structural reset in how enterprises buy technology, rather than a surge in discretionary spending. ""CIOs are aggressively consolidating vendors, bundling what were once multiple mid-sized contracts into fewer, broader and longer-term engagements with clearer accountability. These deals now typically span seven to ten years. ""","Cognizant is learnt to have secured a deal worth over $1 billion from swiss pharma major novartis.

Labour code: Companies' Q3 numbers to reflect higher gratuity,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/labour-code-cos-q3-nos-to-reflect-higher-gratuity/articleshow/126473100.cms,".

NEW DELHI: The first impact of the labour codes will be felt in the December quarter results with companies making higher provision for gratuity.""Companies will need to update their gratuity liability provisions in line with Ind AS 19, recognising past service liabilities as the new labour codes came into effect on Nov 21, 2025. Many companies are in the process of obtaining actuarial valuations to true up their gratuity liability provisions, and the impact may be reflected in the Dec quarterly results. If such a true-up is not performed, companies may provide a disclosure explaining why it was omitted unless the impact is immaterial,"" said Kuldip Kumar, partner at Mainstay Tax Advisors, a consulting company.Auditors told TOI that there may be some impact on the bottom lines of some of the companies, while some others may use the opportunity to update their provisions.""Companies are evaluating the impact of the change in definition of wages and the impact on the provisions required in the quarterly accounts, in view of the labour codes, FAQs issued by the labour ministry and the Accounting Standards Board of the ICAI,"" added Amarpal Chadha, partner at consulting firm EY India.Under the new law, at least half the earnings of an employee will be treated as basic salary and dearness allowance and companies will have to provide gratuity based on that.""The extent of the impact will depend on the existing compensation structure, for example, where excluded allowances exceed 50% of salary or the number of fixed-term employees, who now become eligible for gratuity after one year of service,"" said Kumar.Besides, he said, according to draft rules for the new labour codes for calculating gratuity, items such as performance bonuses, stock option benefits, telephone, internet and medical reimbursements, creche allowance, and the value of meal vouchers are excluded. Therefore, it will not be surprising if some organisations can dodge the big jumps in gratuity liability.Higher provisions will be required by companies that did not always stick to the 50% gratuity formula as the rules have now categorically provided for the payment.",The first impact of the labour codes will be felt in the december quarter results.

Bluebird Lift-Off Shows ISRO Commercial Power As Nambi Narayanan Calls LVM-3 Game Changer Move

BENGALURU: When OrbitAid's 25-kg Ayulsat lifts off aboard Isro's PSLV-C62 Monday, the mission's success will bring India a step closer to becoming the second country in the world to demonstrate on-orbit satellite refuelling, a capability so far claimed only by China, reports Chethan Kumar.Last year, China carried out a similar demonstration, but details remain limited and official disclosures sparse. No other spacefaring nation, including the US, has publicly demonstrated the technology in orbit. However, US firm Astroscale is developing a refuelling technology but is yet to launch.Ayulsat won't demonstrate a full on-orbit re-fuelling. It is designed as a target satellite to validate fuel transfer in the space environment. Unlike more complex servicing missions involving two spacecraft, OrbitAid's first step focuses on internal refuelling within a single satellite, allowing engineers to study how fluids behave in microgravity under real orbital conditions. OrbitAid founder and CEO Sakthikumar R told TOI the first refuelling is expected to take place within four hours of launch.",Orbitaid's 25-kg ayulsat lifts off aboard isro's pslv-c62 monday.

Govt Sends Notice To Elon Musk's X On Grok AI Chatbot Misuse, IT Ministry Seeks Action Report

X is said to have accepted mistakes, pledged rectification

NEW DELHI: A week after the Centre warned of legal consequences, microblogging platform X has acknowledged lapses in content moderation linked to its AI chatbot Grok, taking down about 3,500 pieces of content and deleting over 600 accounts, govt sources said on Sunday. The platform has assured authorities that it will comply with Indian laws and will not allow obscene imagery going forward.The action follows a Jan 2 directive from the ministry of electronics and information technology (MeitY), which pulled up X over the circulation of vulgar, obscene and unlawful content generated through Grok, including non-consensual sexualised images of women. The ministry had asked X to submit a detailed action taken report within 72 hours, spelling out technical and organisational safeguards, enforcement steps and oversight mechanisms to prevent recurrence.According to sources, X has now accepted its mistake and conveyed that corrective measures have been initiated. Besides blocking content and deleting accounts, the platform has assured stricter enforcement of its policies to prevent misuse of AI-generated imagery.Earlier, X’s initial response to the notice, though lengthy, was seen by govt as falling short of expectations, as it did not clearly spell out takedown specifics or future prevention measures.This prompted MeitY to seek additional details, while warning that failure to observe due diligence obligations could result in loss of safe harbour protection under Section 79 of IT Act, apart from action under other applicable laws, including BNS.In its notice, the ministry said Grok was being misused by users to create or manipulate images through prompts and synthetic outputs, targeting women in a derogatory and vulgar manner. It stressed such activity reflected serious gaps in platform-level safeguards and enforcement. X has maintained publicly that it takes action against illegal content, including child sexual abuse material, by removing such content, suspending accounts and cooperating with law enforcement.“Anyone using or prompting Grok to make illegal content will face the same consequences as if they uploaded illegal content,” the platform had said earlier. The controversy has not been limited to India. Regulators in UK and EU have also raised concerns over AI-generated “digital undressing” images linked to Grok. UK communications regulator Ofcom has sought clarification from X and xAI on steps taken to meet legal obligations, while European Commission has reportedly asked the platform to preserve documents related to the chatbot.With scrutiny mounting globally, govt sources said India will continue to closely monitor compliance by X to ensure that online safety norms and statutory obligations are strictly followed.","Microblogging platform x has acknowledged lapses in content moderation linked to its ai chatbot grok.

A look at Connor McDavid and Lauren Kyle’s net worth, career earnings and endorsement



Connor McDavid’s on-ice resume barely needs framing anymore. The Edmonton Oilers captain has spent nearly a decade redefining what elite production looks like in the modern NHL. Beyond the career points and trophies, McDavid has made a name for himself that offers long-term security. Alongside his wife, Lauren Kyle, that evolution has taken shape as one of hockey’s most compelling off-ice partnerships.Kyle is not a background figure in McDavid’s success story. An established interior designer and entrepreneur, she has created a career independently. Together, their estimated $35 to $42 million net worth reflects two careers growing side by side, each adding value in its own way rather than leaning on the other.The largest driver of the couple’s wealth remains McDavid’s NHL earnings. In October 2025, he signed a two-year, $25 million contract extension with the Oilers, ensuring his stay in Edmonton through the 2027–28 season. The deal, which takes effect from the next season, carries a $12.5 million average annual value and reinforces his position at the very top of the league’s salary structure. Combined with his original long-term agreement, McDavid’s total NHL earnings now comfortably exceed the $100 million mark.Off the ice, endorsements continue to play a meaningful role. McDavid’s deal with BodyArmor and Rogers as central to his endorsement work, which focuses on trust and long-term value instead of quick attention. He has always avoided flashy branding, and his sponsorships follow the same steady approach as his NHL contracts.Lauren Kyle’s contributions add a different dimension to the couple’s financial picture. Through Kyle & Co. Design Studio, she has developed a strong reputation in high-end interior design, most notably after the couple’s Edmonton home was featured in Architectural Digest. That exposure accelerated her transition from client-based design to brand-driven ventures.Kyle has since expanded into lifestyle and hospitality with Trove Living, Bar Trove, and Sports Club Atelier. While the highly anticipated Sports Club Atelier x Hockey Canada collection has been delayed, Kyle recently confirmed a new collection launch and emphasized that the collaboration remains in progress. According to her, the wait will be worth it, an approach consistent with her measured, quality-first business strategy.Their personal timeline mirrors that same deliberate pace Connor McDavid and Lauren Kyle first met in 2016 and were married on July 27, 2024, in a private ceremony held on Old Woman Island, a quiet, secluded place on Lake Muskoka in Ontario. They also picked the Muskoka region for both their engagement and wedding celebrations, keeping everything private and personal rather than making it a public event.As both continue to grow in their careers, their combined net worth is about more than money. It shows steady planning and two separate careers moving forward together, a balance that is still rare in top-level professional sports.Also Read: Connor McDavid and wife Lauren Kyle's love life: Inside Edmonton Oilers star's relationship timeline and personal journey","Connor mcdavid and wife lauren kyle are worth an estimated $35 to $42 million.

Shaquille O'Neal Pepsi Commercial 1997

After retiring from basketball in 2011, Shaquille O’Neal, also popularly known as Shaq, who is the former NBA star turned sports analyst, built a massive wealth in various sectors such as fast food chains, real estate, etc. Instead of staying in one lane, Shaquille O’Neal, aka “Shaq”, broadened his business ideas, which have led to his immense financial growth, leading him to become one of the NBA’s wealthiest individuals.Shaquille O'Neal has a current net worth of $500 million, as per Celebrity Net Worth. Shaquille O’Neal is a basketball legend, but he gained popularity not just for his on-court moments, but also off of it. Shaq appeared in popular ads for different companies. It is very well-known that Shaq has a very fun personality that makes him friendly around people, and this is why many popular brands work with him. From fast food chains to the world’s top tech companies, Shaq has worked with tons of brands promoting their products, which has led to the massive financial empire that he has today.Shaquille O'Neal once owned 10% of the 155 Five Guys, a burger chain, before selling the stake in 2016.Shaq then went over to focus on expanding his business ideas, and one such idea was the concept of fried chicken, the Big Chicken, which he launched in 2018. Thereafter, to promote his business to the mass population, Shaq launched the “Big Chicken Shaq”, a reality show, and eventually, the Big Chicken has grown to become one of the fastest-growing fast-food chains in the United States. After its massive success, Shaq began expanding it outside of America. In 2024, Shaq opened Big Chicken chains in Manchester, England. He named the items in the menu after some important people in his life, such as Charles Barkley, the former NBA legend.Shaquille O'Neal also bought a few stakes in Papa John's in 2019 and invested in nine stores in Atlanta, Georgia. A year later, he introduced the Shaq-a-Roni pizza in collaboration with Papa John's. Shaq-a-Roni pizza is a large family-sized cheesy pizza, and with each sale of that large cheesy pizza, it contributes around one dollar to the Papa John’s Foundation, helping young boys and girls get proper education and improving easier access to food.Shaquille O'Neal entered into a partnership with Reebok in 1992, just as he was drafted into the big league by the Orlando Magic in the 1992 draft. He then launched his sneaker, which is now his classic ""Shaq Attaq."" And almost 30 years later, he came back to the same brand in even a bigger way. In 2021, Shaq helped finalize a deal worth $2.4 billion to buy Reebok from Adidas.In 2013, Shaquille O'Neal bought a stake in the Sacramento Kings, the team with which he had a rivalry during his time with the Lakers. He joked about ironically calling them the ""Shaqramento Kings"", before selling his stakes in 2022, after he joined WynnBET, as the NBA doesn’t allow players or even coaches to partner directly with gambling companies.Shaquille O'Neal invested in Google for $0.25 million in 1999. He was introduced to this idea of investing in Google by a tech investor whom he once met in Los Angeles. At the time, Google was valued at around $100 million, however, that early investment later grew into one of its most successful financial moves. And since then, he has also invested in Apple, only expanding his wealth and affluence.Shaquille O’Neal endorsed and partnered with Pepsi in the 1990s, promoting their brand by appearing in advertisements for them. Back in 2023, Shaq appeared in the ""I Wish"" campaign in order to promote Mini Cans for Pepsi, which they had launched back then.Also Read: Magic Johnson and Cookie Johnson’s combined net worth in 2025: NBA power couple’s career earnings, endorsements, and more","Shaquille o'neal, aka shaq, is a former nba star turned sports analyst.

NEW DELHI: Isro will mark its first launch of 2026 - PSLV C62 mission - on Monday (Jan 12) at 10.17 am from the first launchpad at the Sriharikota spaceport.The rocket will launch an advanced earth observation satellite EOS-N1 (code-named 'Anvesha'), another 'eye in the sky' that will boost India's surveillance powers from space. Besides the primary payload EOS-N1, PSLV will also be carrying a European demonstrator satellite and 17 other satellites belonging to Indian and foreign agencies.EOS-N1 is a hyperspectral imaging satellite developed primarily for DRDO. It is capable of ""seeing"" in hundreds of wavelengths to identify materials on the ground - making it a high-priority asset for national security and surveillance. It will help India secure its borders and also be used in fields like agriculture, urban mapping and environmental observation.Besides EOS-N1, 18 secondary payloads, including Europe's Kestrel Initial Demonstrator, will piggyback on the primary satellite and will be placed in space. The KID mission will feature experimental re-entry of a small capsule in collaboration with a Spanish startup, with a planned splashdown in South Pacific Ocean.Other secondary payloads are cubesats from Indian startups and universities, including CV Raman Global University's CGUSAT-1, Dhruva Space's DA-1, Space Kidz India's SR-2, Assam Don Bosco University's Lachit-1, Akshath Aerospace's Solaras-S4 and Dayanand Sagar University's DSAT-1.

Mathematics with real-world impact



Securing the quantum future

Indian-origin mathematician Nalini Joshi has been named New South Wales’ Scientist of the Year, becoming the first mathematician to receive the state’s top science honour in Australia. The recognition highlights her pioneering work in applied mathematics and its growing importance in addressing complex scientific and technological challenges, from climate modelling to secure digital communications.The award places a spotlight on the often unseen role mathematics plays in modern life, with Joshi’s research helping to shape advances in fields such as fibre-optic technology, nonlinear physics and emerging quantum systems.Nalini Joshi is a world-leading applied mathematician and a Professor of Mathematics at the University of Sydney, where she currently serves as Chair of Applied Mathematics. She made history as the first woman appointed Professor of Mathematics at the university, a milestone widely seen as a breakthrough for gender representation in Australian academia.Her research is internationally recognised in the field of integrable systems, a branch of mathematics that studies complex nonlinear equations.These equations are essential for describing real-world phenomena that do not behave in simple or predictable ways, including fluid flows, wave motion and optical systems.Although rooted in theory, Joshi’s work has had wide practical influence. Integrable systems play a crucial role in fibre-optic communications, which form the backbone of the internet and global data networks, as well as in climate science, where advanced mathematical models help scientists understand highly sensitive and chaotic environmental systems.Colleagues often note that her research demonstrates how abstract mathematics can drive innovation across disciplines, even when its contributions remain largely invisible to the public.In recent years, Joshi has increasingly focused on the implications of quantum computing, particularly in the area of cryptography. Cryptography is the science of keeping information secure so that only authorised people can access it. It is what protects online banking, digital payments, emails, messaging apps and government systems by scrambling data into coded forms that are extremely difficult to break.While quantum computers promise major advances in areas such as drug discovery and materials science, they also pose a serious risk to today’s cryptographic systems. Powerful quantum machines could potentially crack many of the encryption methods currently used to protect financial systems and digital infrastructure.Joshi has warned that governments and industries are not sufficiently prepared for this shift. She has highlighted Australia’s limited number of specialists capable of developing post-quantum cryptography, new encryption techniques designed to withstand quantum attacks, and has argued that long-term investment in advanced mathematics is essential.“Mathematics is central to securing our quantum future,” she has said.The New South Wales Scientist of the Year award also acknowledges Joshi’s broader contributions as a leader, mentor and advocate for science. She has been a strong voice for strengthening mathematical education and research capacity, and for recognising mathematics as a foundational discipline that enables progress across science and technology.",Nalini joshi has been named new south wales’ scientist of the year.

Why Jensen Huang believes being Nvidia CEO is a ‘great responsibility’

“great responsibility”

“We are the captain of this industry and we have supply chain partners and collaboration partners all over the world who are counting on us to do our part. So there is a great responsibility that comes with our company. It took us 34 years to get here. We're getting good at it. If you do something for 34 years, you can figure it out,”

“Demand for Nvidia GPUs is skyrocketing. Models are increasing by a factor of 10, an order of magnitude, every single year,""





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has revealed he has no plans to step down from his position at the company anytime soon. He noted that he will remain in charge for now. During a question-and-answer session at CES, 62-year-old Huang said this in response to shareholders' questions about his future at the chipmaker. Huang has led Nvidia since he started the company in 1993. He said he currently has no plans to leave his role, while the company has yet to announce who may replace him in the coming days.Huang attributed his long tenure to his continued interest in the company’s operations and his ability to meet performance expectations. He said,Huang said that there is ain being Nvidia's CEO. He noted that the AI chipmaker's performance will not just affect the tech industry but will also impact the entire market.he explained.Huang and Nvidia will have a lot of work to do in the coming years. At CES, Huang announced Nvidia’s next-generation Vera Rubin superchip, which will begin shipping later this year. The company also announced a partnership with Mercedes-Benz to develop self-driving technology that will compete with Tesla's Autopilot.The Vera Rubin platform, which is named after American astronomer Vera Rubin, who changed how scientists understand galaxy motion, was one of the biggest highlights. It promises to train AI 10 times more efficiently than its previous version, Blackwell. According to Huang, a 10 trillion-parameter model can now be trained in one month using one-quarter of the chips.Huang noted.Huang has been Nvidia's CEO since 1993. He took the company from a stock price of just pennies per share between 1999 and 2016 to more than $187 today, making it the most valuable company in the world.His tenure has been much longer than that of most other tech leaders, including Apple's Tim Cook (14 years), Meta's Mark Zuckerberg (22 years), and Tesla's Elon Musk (who founded SpaceX in 2002).Born in Taipei in 1963, Huang moved to the US at age nine after his parents sent him to study there. Due to a mistake, he ended up at a tough school in rural Kentucky, where he did chores like cleaning toilets and helped his roommate learn to read.He finished high school at 16, studied electrical engineering, and worked night shifts at a diner to support himself. In 1993, Huang co-founded Nvidia at a Denny’s restaurant. Over 30 years later, Nvidia has become one of the world’s most valuable companies, with most of Huang’s wealth accruing after 2020 as AI demand boosted Nvidia’s chip sales.",Jensen huang has been ceo of ai chipmaker nvidia since 1993.

Investor concerns beyond Jeff Bezos







Amazon founder Jeff Bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’, even he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society. Recently, speaking at the Italian Tech Week alongside Exor CEO John Elkann, Bezos said that the excitement around AI has led to unusual investor behaviour, with billions of dollars flowing into companies regardless strong fundamentals.Bezos explained that bubbles are characterised by inflated stock prices and a rush of funding into both good and bad ideas. This makes it difficult for the investor to distinguish.Bezos further outlined the hallmarks of bubbles. He said that the current AI climate as one where “every experiment or idea gets funded,” even if the fundamentals are weak. He pointed to unusual behavior such as small companies with only a handful of employees receiving billions of dollars in investment. This, he said, is a hallmark of industrial bubbles, where excitement drives capital into ventures indiscriminately.Despite this caution, Bezos feels that the technology itself is genuine and transformative. “AI is real, and it is going to change every industry,” he told the audience. He further compared the situation to the biotech bubble of the 1990s, which witnessed many companies fail but ultimately produced some life-saving drugs. Industrial bubbles, he argued, are not necessarily harmful; when the dust settles, society benefits from the inventions that survive.Bezos’ remarks echo a growing chorus of warnings from business leaders. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, has previously said the AI market is in a bubble. At the same event in Turin, Goldman Sachs CEO David Solomon cautioned that investor excitement often overlooks risks, predicting a “reset” or “drawdown” in valuations. Similarly, Karim Moussalem, chief investment officer at Selwood Asset Management, recently said the AI trade is beginning to resemble “one of the great speculative manias of market history. ”","Amazon founder jeff bezos has once again cautioned that artificial intelligence is presently an ‘industrial bubble’ however, even he insisted that the technology itself is real and will ultimately deliver huge amounts of benefits to the society.

Putin's 'Starlink-KILLER' Spooks NATO; New Intel Claims Russia Exploring Anti-Satellite Zone Weapon

What FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said about the SpaceX approval

“This FCC authorisation is a game-changer for enabling next-generation services. By authorising 15,000 new and advanced satellites, the FCC has given SpaceX the green light to deliver unprecedented

satellite broadband capabilities

, strengthen competition, and help ensure that no community is left behind.”

“We find that authorisation for additional satellites is in the public interest, even as the Gen2

Starlink

Upgrade satellites remain untested on orbit. We defer authorisation of the remaining 14,988 proposed Gen2 Starlink satellites, including satellites proposed for operations above 600 km,”





The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has authorised SpaceX to expand its satellite network to enhance global internet and mobile connectivity. According to a report by the news agency Reuters, the US government agency recently approved a request from the rocket company to deploy 7,500 second-generation Starlink satellites. This authorisation will increase the total permitted number of satellites to 15,000 and will allow the company to operate across five different frequencies to increase network capacity and coverage.The expanded satellite constellation is also intended to support direct-to-cell connectivity and provide internet speeds of up to 1 gigabit per second, the Reuters report claims. According to the FCC, the additional hardware will facilitate mobile services outside the US while providing supplemental coverage within the country. As per the report, the agency relaxed earlier regulations that limited overlapping coverage, enabling more reliable service.In a statement to Reuters, FCC Chairman Brendan Carr said,The Reuters report noted that SpaceX had applied for permission to deploy close to 30,000 satellites, but the FCC said it is currently approving only 15,000 of them.the FCC noted.The FCC has even ordered SpaceX to launch 50% of its approved Gen2 satellites, put them in their assigned orbits, and operate them by December 1, 2028.SpaceX must launch the remaining satellites by December 2031. It must also complete the deployment of all 7,500 first-generation satellites into orbit by late November 2027.Last week, Starlink said it would start moving its satellites to lower orbits in 2026. The satellites currently orbiting at around 550 km (342 miles) will be lowered to 480 km. This move is meant to improve space safety.In December, Starlink said one of its satellites had a problem in space that created a small amount of debris. The company lost communication with the spacecraft, which was orbiting at 418 km. This kind of accident is rare for the satellite internet company.SpaceX has become the world's largest satellite operator through Starlink, a network of about 9,400 satellites that provide broadband internet to consumers, governments, and businesses.The FCC's former head, Jessica Rosenworcel, demanded more competition for SpaceX's Starlink in 2024. She pointed out that at the time, Starlink was in charge of almost two-thirds of all operational satellites.","Spacex's starlink network is set for a major expansion after the fcc approved 7,500 new satellites.

Bill Gates pens the year 2026 note; says: Thing I am most upset about is ...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/bill-gates-pens-the-year-2026-note-says-thing-i-am-most-upset-about-is-/articleshow/126450754.cms,"Bill Gates No Longer among Top 10 Billionaires: The Real Reason

Here’s Bill Gates annual 2026 letter in full

Optimism with footnotes

As we start 2026, I am thinking about how the year ahead will set us up for the decades to come.

I have always been an optimist. When I founded Microsoft, I believed a digital revolution powered by great software would make the world a better place. When I started the

Gates Foundation

, I saw an opportunity to save and improve millions of lives because critical areas like children’s health were getting so little money.

In both cases, the results exceeded my expectations. We are far better off than when I was born 70 years ago. I believe the world will keep improving—but it is harder to see that today than it has been in a long time.

Friends and colleagues often ask me how I stay optimistic in an era with so many challenges and so much polarization. My answer is this:

I am still an optimist because I see what innovation accelerated by artificial intelligence will bring.

But these days, my optimism comes with footnotes.

The thing I am most upset about is the fact that the world went backwards last year on a key metric of progress: the number of deaths of children under 5 years old. Over the last 25 years, those deaths went down faster than at any other point in history. But in 2025, they went up for the first time this century, from 4.6 million in 2024 to 4.8 million in 2025—an increase driven by less support from rich countries to poor countries.

This trend will continue unless we make progress in restoring aid budgets.

The next five years will be difficult as we try to get back on track and work to scale up new lifesaving tools. Yet I remain optimistic about the long-term future. As hard as last year was, I don’t believe we will slide back into the Dark Ages.

I believe that, within the next decade, we will not only get the world back on track but enter a new era of unprecedented progress.

The key will be, as always, innovation. Consider this: An HIV diagnosis used to be a death sentence. Today, thanks to revolutionary treatments, a person with HIV can expect to live almost as long as someone without the virus. By the 2040s, new innovations could virtually eliminate deaths from HIV/AIDS.

Budget cuts limit how many people benefit from lifesaving tools, as we saw to devastating effect last year. But nothing can erase the fact that for decades we didn’t know how to save people from HIV, and now we do.

Breakthroughs are a bell that cannot be unrung. They ensure that we will never go back to the world in 2000 where over 10 million children died from preventable causes every year—and they form the core of my optimism about where the world is headed.

But as I mentioned, there are footnotes to my optimism. Although the innovation pipeline sets us up for long-term success, the trajectory of progress hinges on how the world addresses three key questions.

1. Will a world that is getting richer increase its generosity toward those in need?

The “golden rule” precept is more important now than ever with the record disparities in wealth. This idea of treating others as you wish to be treated does not just apply to rich countries giving aid. It must also include philanthropy from the wealthy to help those in need—both domestically and globally—which should grow rapidly in a world with a record number of billionaires and even centibillionaires.

Through the Giving Pledge, I get to work with a number of incredible philanthropists who set a great example by giving away substantial portions of their wealth in smart ways. However, more needs to be done to encourage higher levels of generosity from the rich and to show how fulfilling and impactful it can be.

More needs to be done to encourage higher levels of generosity from the rich and to show how fulfilling and impactful it can be.

Turning to aid budgets for poor countries, I am worried about one number: If funding for health decreases by 20 percent, 12 million more children could die by 2045. I know cuts won’t be reversed overnight, even though aid represented less than 1 percent of GDP even in the most generous countries. But it is critical that we restore some of the funding. The foundation’s Goalkeepers report lays out what is at risk and how the world can best spend the aid it gives.

I will spend much of my year working with partners to advocate for increased funding for the health of the world’s children. I plan to engage with a number of communities, including health care workers, religious groups, and members of diaspora communities to help make this case.

2. Will the world prioritize scaling innovations that improve equality?

Some problems require doing far more than just letting market incentives take their course.

The first critical area is climate change. Without a large global carbon tax (which is, unfortunately, politically unachievable), market forces do not properly incentivize the creation of technologies to reduce climate-related emissions.

Yet only by replacing all emitting activities with cheaper alternatives will we stop the temperature increase. This is why I started Breakthrough Energy 10 years ago and why I will continue to put billions into innovation.

The world has made meaningful progress in the last decade, cutting projected emissions by more than 40 percent. But we still have a lot of innovation and scaling up to do in tough areas like industrial emissions and aviation. Government policies in rich countries are still critical because unless innovations reach scale, the costs won’t come down and we won’t achieve the impact we need.

If we don’t limit climate change, it will join poverty and infectious disease in causing enormous suffering, especially for the world’s poorest people.

Since even in the best case the temperature will continue to go up, we also need to innovate to minimize the negative impacts.

This is called climate adaptation, and a critical example is helping farmers in poor countries with better seeds and better advice so they can grow more even in the face of climate change. Using AI, we will soon be able to provide poor farmers with better advice about weather, prices, crop diseases, and soil than even the richest farmers get today.

The foundation has committed $1.4 billion to supporting farmers on the frontlines of extreme weather.

I will be investing and giving more than ever to climate work in the years ahead while also continuing to give more to children’s health, the foundation’s top priority. The need to ensure money is spent on the most important priorities was the topic of a memo I wrote in the fall.

A second critical area where the world must focus on innovation-driven equality is health care.

Concerns about healthcare costs and quality are higher than ever in all countries.

In theory, people should feel optimistic about the state of health care with the incredible pipeline of innovations. For example, a recent breakthrough in diagnosing Alzheimer’s will revolutionize how we test for—and ultimately prevent—this disease, saving billions of dollars in costs. (Funding Alzheimer’s research is a particular focus for me.)

There’s similar progress on obesity and cancer, as well as on problems in developing countries like malaria, TB, and malnutrition.

Despite so much progress, however, the cost and complexity of the system means very few people are satisfied with their care. I believe we can improve health care dramatically in all countries by using AI not only to accelerate the development of innovations but directly in the delivery of health care.

Like many of you, I already use AI to better understand my own health. Just imagine what will be possible as it improves and becomes available for every patient and provider. Always-available, high-quality medical advice will improve medicine by every measure.

We aren’t quite there yet—developers still have work to do on reliability and how we connect the AI to doctors and nurses so they are empowered to check and override the system.

But I’m optimistic we will soon begin to scale access globally. I am following this work so the Gates Foundation and partners can make sure this capability is available in the countries that need it most—where there aren’t enough medical personnel—at the same time it is available elsewhere.

We are already working on pilots and making sure that even relatively uncommon African languages are fully supported.

Governments will have to play a central role in leading the implementation of AI into their health systems.

This is another case where the market alone won’t and can’t provide the solution.

A third and final area I will mention briefly is education. AI gives us a chance for the kind of personalized learning to keep students motivated that we have dreamed of in the past. This is now a focus of the Gates Foundation’s spending on education, and I am hopeful it will be empowering to both teachers and students. I’ve seen this firsthand in New Jersey, and it will be game changing as we scale it for the world.

All three of these areas—climate, health, and education—can improve rapidly with the right government focus. This year I will spend a lot of time meeting with pioneers all over the world to see which countries are doing the best work so we can spread best practices.

3. Will we minimize negative disruptions caused by AI as it accelerates?

Of all the things humans have ever created, AI will change society the most. It will help solve many of our current problems while also bringing new challenges very different from past innovations.

When people in the AI space predict that AGI or fully humanoid robots will come soon and then those deadlines are missed, it creates the impression that these things will never happen. However, there is no upper limit on how intelligent AIs will get or on how good robots will get, and I believe the advances will not plateau before exceeding human levels.

The two big challenges in the next decade are use of AI by bad actors and disruption to the job market.

Both are real risks that we need to do a better job managing. We’ll need to be deliberate about how this technology is developed, governed, and deployed.

In 2015, I gave a TED talk warning that the world was not ready to handle a pandemic. If we had prepared properly for the Covid pandemic, the amount of human suffering would have been dramatically less. Today, an even greater risk than a naturally caused pandemic is that a non-government group will use open source AI tools to design a bioterrorism weapon.

We’ll need to be deliberate about how AI is developed, governed, and deployed.

The second challenge is job market disruption. AI capabilities will allow us to make far more goods and services with less labor. In a mathematical sense, we should be able to allocate these new capabilities in ways that benefit everyone. As AI delivers on its potential, we could reduce the work week or even decide there are some areas we don’t want to use AI in.

The effects of this disruption are hard to model. Sometimes, when a game-changing technology improves rapidly, it drives more demand at lower cost and, by making the world richer, increases demand in other areas. For example, AI makes software developers at least twice as efficient, which makes coding cheaper while also creating demand elasticity for code. (Computing is a good historical example where lower costs actually caused the overall market to grow.

)

Even with this complexity, the rate of improvement is already starting to be enough to disrupt job demand in areas like software development. Other areas like warehouse work or phone support are not quite there yet, but once the AIs become more capable, the job disruption will be more immediate.

We’re already starting to see the impact of AI on the job market, and I think this impact will grow over the next five years. Even if the transition takes longer than I expect, we should use 2026 to prepare ourselves for these changes—including which policies will best help spread the wealth and deal with the important role jobs play in our society.

Different political parties will likely suggest different approaches.

By including these footnotes, particularly the last one, some readers may find my continued optimism even more surprising. But as we start 2026, I remain optimistic about the days ahead because of two core human capabilities.

The first is our ability to anticipate problems and prepare for them, and therefore ensure that our new discoveries make all of us better off. The second is our capacity to care about each other. Throughout history, you can always find stories of people tending not just to themselves or their clan or their country but to the greater good.

Those two qualities—foresight and care—are what give me hope as the year begins. As long as we keep exercising those abilities, I believe the years ahead can be ones of real progress.





Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates has written his annual letter for 2026, expressing a rare and “upsetting” shift in global progress. While maintaining long-term optimism, Gates revealed that a critical metric of human health has moved backward: child mortality. Gates noted that the trend will continue unless we make progress in restoring aid budgets.In his annual letter titled, “Optimism with footnotes”, Gates highlighted that for the first time since 2000, the number of deaths for children under the age of five increased, rising from 4.6 million in 2024 to 4.8 million in 2025. He also noted that while AI-driven innovation in health and climate is accelerating, the “trajectory of progress” is currently under threat by multiple factors: dwindling generosity, climate and health equality and AI disruptions.Gates remains confident that the “innovation pipeline” will eventually spark a new era of progress.","Gates: i believe the world will keep improving, but it is harder to see that today than it has been in a long time.

Paramount Skydance’s return-to-office (RTO) policy took effect this week. As part of the return-to-office policy the employees in New York and Los Angeles offices will now have to work on-site five days a week. The return-to-office mandate was first announced by Paramount Skydance CEO David Ellison in September last year. This new policy marks a significant shift for the company as it seeks to strengthen in-person collaboration. The company has also made it clear that the employees who could not or chose not to comply with the new requirement were offered severance packages. Paramount also confirmed that about 600 workers accepted severance, underscoring the scale of the transition. Staff not assigned to offices are part of “Phase 2” of the rollout, with details expected later this year.As reported by Business Insider, in a companywide email, Ellison thanked staff for their flexibility and commitment during the first week back. “I know that returning to the office full-time has been an adjustment for many, and I truly appreciate the flexibility and commitment you’ve shown,” he wrote.

How the iPhone 17 ended up under seven cars on a busy road



The ‘ultimate drop test’ leaves only minor damage



Internet reacts with disbelief and humour







Smartphone durability is usually tested in controlled labs, but one biker’s misfortune has turned into an extreme real-world experiment. A viral video circulating on Instagram shows an iPhone 17 falling off a motorcycle mount onto a busy road and being run over repeatedly by passing cars. Against all expectations, the device not only survived but continued to function. Shared by a rider known online as @dxbonthrottle, the clip has triggered widespread disbelief, humour and admiration for the phone’s toughness. Dubbed the “ultimate drop test” by viewers, the incident has reignited conversations around smartphone build quality, everyday riding safety, and whether modern flagship phones are tougher than manufacturers officially claim.The incident unfolded while the biker was riding with his phone secured to a handle-mounted holder. In the video, the device suddenly slips free and drops directly onto the road. Realising what has happened, the rider quickly slows down, takes a U-turn, and looks back to see his phone lying in the middle of moving traffic.Before he could retrieve it safely, multiple vehicles drove straight over the device. According to the biker, at least seven cars passed over the phone before he was able to step onto the road and pick it up, making the situation far worse than a simple drop.Despite the heavy traffic and repeated impact, the biker claims the phone remained operational. The original clip was shared with the caption, “My iPhone 17 got run over by 7 cars,” instantly drawing attention across social media platforms.What shocked viewers most was not just the survival of the phone, but the fact that it powered on and functioned normally after such punishment. For many, it looked like a stress test no manufacturer would ever dare to stage deliberately.In a follow-up video, the biker showed a close-up of the phone to reveal the extent of the damage. Surprisingly, the screen appeared intact, and the body showed no major structural issues. The only noticeable problem was damage to the camera lens.The rider captioned the second clip by calling it the “ultimate drop test,” adding that the camera glass seemed to have taken the brunt of the impact while protecting the rest of the device. Apart from that, the phone reportedly continued working as normal.Social media users flooded the comments with astonishment and jokes, worldwide, marvelling together at unexpected resilience and internet-breaking durability moments. Some claimed the phone deserved an award for survival, while others joked that their own devices crack under far gentler conditions. Several users suggested Apple should use the clip in future advertisements, calling it better than any official durability demo.Others pointed out that luck likely played a role, but still praised the build quality. One popular comment summed up the mood perfectly: the camera lens “took one for the team.”","A viral video shows an iphone 17 falling off a motorcycle mount onto a busy road and being run over repeatedly by passing cars.
