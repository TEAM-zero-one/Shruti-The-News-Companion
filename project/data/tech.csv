Charlie Kirk 'ASSASSIN' On Cam: FBI Releases Photos Of Shooting Suspect | BREAKING NEWS





Charlie Kirk, a prominent conservative activist and close ally of US President Donald Trump, was fatally shot Thursday while speaking at Utah Valley University.As law enforcement continues its manhunt for the suspect, an odd development has added to the confusion: Screenshots circulating online show a book titled “The Shooting of Charlie Kirk: A Comprehensive Account of the Utah Valley University Attack, the Aftermath, and America’s Response,” credited to an author named Anastasia J Casey.According to the screenshots, the listed publication date was September 9—one day before the shooting. The listing was allegedly visible on Amazon briefly before being removed. The images of the cover, title, and date quickly spread across X, fueling speculation about foreknowledge or a cover-up.“Can someone investigate this perhaps? It’s now pulled from Amazon online listing. Who is Anastasia Casey? Regardless of the credibility of the 9.9 publish date, how did this book get out so quick,” one user wrote.Another post read: “But check this out, another book published today? How the hell can you get a book published and up for sale in such short time ??? @FBIDirectorKash @AGPamBondi @realDonaldTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr.”Some users drew comparisons to past events. “A book entitled ‘The Shooting of Charlie Kirk’ by Anastasia J Casey has appeared on Amazon with a PUBLICATION DATE OF SEPTEMBER 9TH 2025. A DAY BEFORE HE WAS ASSASSINATED,” one person commented.Others pointed out more examples. “This is like the 9/11 reporting strangeness. Something is off on how quickly these people are making these books. There are 2-3 more published yesterday about Charlie's assassination. One is 36 pages,” another user noted.Amazon in a statement said that they have taken down the title in question. “We have content guidelines governing which books can be listed for sale, and we remove books that do not adhere to these guidelines. The title in question is no longer available for sale. Due to a technical issue, the date of publication that had been displayed for this title, while it was briefly listed, was incorrect, and we apologize for any confusion this may have caused. The title was published late in the afternoon on September 10th,” Amazon spokesperson told TOI.","Screenshots circulating online show a book titled “the shooting of charlie kirk: a comprehensive account of the utah valley university attack, the aftermath, and america’s response,” credited to an author named anastasia j casey.

Stanford Meets India: Notes from a Country in Motion,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/stanford-meets-india-notes-from-a-country-in-motion/articleshow/123822979.cms,"The trip's postcard moment

daulat ki chaat

India 1: the top 100 million, global in outlook, on Netflix and credit cards.

India 2: the aspiring middle, mobile-first, leapfrogging basic infrastructure.

India 3: rural, cash-driven, still outside the formal economy.

.

On the first morning in Delhi, the jet lag sat heavy in the lobby of Shangri-La. Stanford MBAs were trying their best to be awake, sipping tea beneath chandeliers, eyes still foggy from the 16-hour flight. There were seventeen first-years (or “MBA1s”), four second-years (MBA2s), plus their professor, Yossi Feinberg, and staff advisor Ming Chu. All came to India for the Global Study Trip, a Stanford Business School tradition in which students visit countries and immerse themselves in its business fabric.The objective this time was growth and innovation in India, something that sounded clean on paper, the sort of thing you’d write on a syllabus. In reality, though, India is a place that resists syllabi. The country offers you contradictions in every direction: QR codes on street-side coconut stalls, ministers talking about Mars missions, Bollywood stars who double as entrepreneurs, investors who cite the Ramayana to define leadership. For the students, the week would be less about learning what India “is” and more about getting comfortable with the fact that it can be many things at once.The first to meet them was Gaurav Dalmia, investor, essayist, philosopher. He greeted the group in his home and reached backward in time. India, he said, had been prosperous for most of history, before the West discovered more efficient ways to organize capital and trade. Its resurgence now would not look like China’s rocket-fuel sprint. “India compounds,” he told them. “Six to seven percent a year. It feels slow, boring even. But compounding has its own magic.”The students were inspired, though still recovering from the jet lag. They had read about India’s GDP figures before, but Dalmia’s framing was different. Not hockey sticks but patience. And then he opened a copy of the Ramayana and read aloud the qualities of an ideal leader: grateful, truthful, versatile, patient, slow to anger, free of envy, yet terrifying when provoked. A few students looked up, surprised. Was this an epic poem or a CEO job description? Dalmia smiled. “Indian philosophy is not abstract,” he said. “It is applied leadership.”The group left buzzing, trying to reconcile what they’d heard with the India outside the windows, with horns blaring, construction cranes looming, roadside tea vendors serving to crowds that never seemed to thin.The evening brought Puneet Dalmia of Dalmia Bharat, whose cement plants have built many of the highways the students drove on. He spoke of India’s four “I’s”: Intent, Ideas, Independence, Individuals. Intent is what the state must set; ideas are the spark of entrepreneurs; independence is the freedom to act without capture; and individuals (the people) are the multiplier.But he also quoted from ancient texts and Harvard research, toggling between scriptures and slides. Happiness, he said, cannot be measured only in stock prices or steel output. “We are building not just an economy,” he said, “but a society. Growth must be judged by its impact on human dignity.”It was early in the trip, but already the students noticed a pattern: Indian business leaders often spoke in two registers, one of GDP, capital markets, and tech; another of values, philosophy, and family. In Silicon Valley, that combination might sound like posturing. Here, it felt woven into the operating system.The evening was unlike anything the students had experienced. Thanks to Dalmia, Indian Accent, normally tucked away in a sleek Delhi hotel, had been transported inside the Red Fort. Servers carried outunder Mughal arches, blue cheese naan in the shadow of ramparts where emperors once surveyed their kingdom. It was haute cuisine against a backdrop of empire. When the plates were cleared, the courtyard darkened, and the sandstone walls came alive with the sound-and-light show: Shah Jahan commissioning the fort, the British seizing it, Nehru’s voice declaring independence in 1947.The next day, Sanjeev Bikhchandani sat down with the delegation and told his story about building Naukri. During MBA placement season, Bikhchandani noticed: “Talent is scarce, and markets don’t lie.” He began photographing public placement records and selling the data as a survey. That instinct (observe behavior, package insight) became Naukri.com, India’s first big internet success.His lessons amazed the delegation with unusual force: ‘Clunky but dense’ beats ‘slick but sparse’. Customer insight beats capital. In downturns, when others cut, spend more. “Be frugal in bubbles, bold in busts,” he told them.Agra was the trip’s postcard moment. The buses pulled up at 10AM, and suddenly the Taj Mahal was no longer a photograph in a textbook but a living presence. Students wandered its marble terraces in awe, tracing inlay work with their fingers, staring at the perfect symmetry that somehow still felt human. Some tried to capture it on their phones, only to realize no lens could hold the shimmer of white stone against a pale morning sky.Later, the group regrouped for lunch at the Oberoi Amarvilas, where every dining-room window frames the monument like a painting. Between courses, heads kept drifting toward the view, as if the Taj were a third guest at the table. By afternoon, India reminded them of its unpredictability: a sudden downpour sent the delegation running into a makeshift roadside restaurant, plastic chairs and steaming chai serving as impromptu refuge. When the rain eased, they climbed back into their buses, damp but elated. It was the kind of day that felt both choreographed and accidental: iconic grandeur, sudden chaos, and the luck of experiencing both in a single sweep.In Mumbai, they met Manish Kejriwal, private equity veteran at Kedaara. Unlike the spreadsheets they were used to at Stanford, Kejriwal described investing as anthropology. Triangulate character, not just numbers. Build dissent into your firm so the junior analyst feels safe disagreeing with the partner. “We have an obligation to dissent,” he said.He spoke of India not as one market but as a mosaic of states, families, informal networks. His preference was for shovels over gold mines: workflow software and data services.At The Times of India offices, Sivakumar Sundaram and his colleagues put together an insightful session using interactive polls and a live thinking session. “There isn’t one India,” Sundaram said. “There are three.”The categories weren’t neat, but he explained the country better than a GDP figure.Later, Cyril Shroff, India’s most famous corporate lawyer, met the students in his Peninsula Towers office. His firm, once boutique, now has sixty percent women. He spoke of India’s legal system as both bottleneck and backbone: slow courts, yes, but a structure that undergirds growth.More striking was his framing of India’s independence. The country, he said, had moved from importing regulation to exporting it: Aadhaar as a model for digital identity, UPI for payments. “A lawyer won’t be replaced by AI, but by an AI-enabled lawyer.” In Silicon Valley, AI was usually pitched as disruption. Here, it was augmentation.Kunal Shah’s talk moved the group. The founder of CRED spoke less like a startup CEO and more like a philosopher. “India is a low-trust market,” he said. “That’s why super-apps make sense here. That’s why if you don’t buy a billboard, you don’t exist.”He shared some specific, unique facts: 37 GB of mobile data per Indian per month, but only 20M consumers drive 80% of online GMV. YouTube earns just $3 per Indian user annually. “India is the world’s largest MAU farm,” he said, “but not the world’s best ARPU market.”He spoke of status as the true currency: uniforms over paychecks, weddings as theater, caste layered into speech. “You can underpay people if you give them status,” he joked. He warned that subsidies dull ambition, that ambition comes from hunger, and that AI risks making people mentally lazy. “The tool that makes you atrophy is also the gym,” he said, cryptically. Many loved his candor but no one forgot it.An interesting setting came with Piyush Goyal, India’s Minister of Commerce. In a wood-paneled room, he began by congratulating Stanford, after which he pivoted to geopolitics.India, he said, has a habit of turning crises into opportunities. Buying discounted Russian oil when the West sanctioned it. Launching a Mars mission for $50M. Remaining “multi-aligned” instead of non-aligned: friends with Washington, Moscow, and Tel Aviv all at once.On AI, he said that “the human mind will remain supreme.” On trade, he was clear that every country makes its choices. On culture, he urged students to witness Ganesh Chaturthi in Mumbai. “Religion here binds people, creates mass fervor, unites the country,” he said.Not all sessions were with businessfolk and ministers. At a nonprofit panel hosted by Melody Mortazavi and Sanjiv Kaura, the students heard from Melody, Sanjiv, the alumni of Teach India, and more changemakers. One of the alumni had gone from Domino’s store manager to retail executive. Another described education as emancipation.For many in the delegation, these stories carried as much weight as the macroeconomics. They put faces to the abstractions of “India 2” and “India 3.”Through it all, Yossi played the role of quiet provocateur. On buses and over breakfasts, he asked questions that unsettled neat conclusions. If India has the cheapest data in the world, why does it have one of the lowest female labor participation rates? If it can build UPI for street vendors, why are courts so slow? If it can send a probe to Mars, why do so few Indians have access to credit?By the end, the trip felt less like a syllabus and more like a kaleidoscope. From Dalmia’s compounding to Bikhchandani’s salary surveys, from Shroff’s AI lawyers to Shah’s philosophy of status, from Goyal’s geopolitics to Teach India’s alumni, the delegation had been shown many Indias.On the final evening, standing on the balcony in Malabar Hill, the students looked out over the city as drums from Ganesh processions echoed through the streets. Someone remarked, “We came looking for lessons in growth. What we found were lessons in resilience, trust, and contradictions.”The reflections were about how the trip itself felt. “We’ve been treated like family everywhere we’ve gone,” said David Pantera, marveling at the warmth of the hospitality. Katy Dolan wrote to the student leaders that the week had “vastly exceeded expectations,” plus a reminder that a trip that had looked seamless to participants had in fact been an intense labor of love from the four MBA2s who led with grace and humor. And for Cayla Davis, the experience “exceeded her wildest imagination,” not just for the meetings and sights but for the thoughtfulness and care woven into the group dynamic.India, folks realized, is not a case study. It is a billion-person startup, a civilization in beta, a place where compounding is destiny and paradox the default mode.And for Stanford’s delegation, that was the real education.","Stanford business school students visited india for global study trip. The objective was growth and innovation in india, something that sounded clean on paper. In reality, though, india is a place that resists syllabi. The delegation visited agra, mumbai and new delhi.

TOI

NEW DELHI: A day after Prime Minister Narendra Modi said that ‘Gyan Bharatam Mission’ is set to become a “proclamation of India’s culture, literature, and consciousness”, the international conference on manuscripts here adopted the “” that resolves to “guard and preserve the priceless manuscript heritage” of India and “acquire and repatriate original manuscripts or secure their digital copies from abroad, ensuring access for research and national pride"".""We firmly believe that manuscripts are not merely relics of the past, they are guiding lights for the future,"" the declaration that was adopted at the end of the three-day conference states. ""We resolve to join the movement of 'Gyan Bharatam', to preserve, digitise and disseminate this vast treasure, making it accessible to the citizens and scholars alike, across the world,"" it further says.Resolving to make India the foremost hub of manuscripts showcasing the world’s most diverse written knowledge tradition, the declaration, among other things, calls for turning 'Gyan Bharatam' into a 'jan aandolan' that strengthens cultural identity and knowledge-based‘Gyan Bharatam’ being steered by the ministry of culture aims to create a national repository through survey, documentation, conservation and digitisation of the more than one crore manuscripts dispersed across India, build an ""alliance of all custodians"" of manuscripts in India and create a countrywide framework for conservation, preservation and dissemination of knowledge.“Our objective is clear – to preserve, publish, and make manuscripts accessible through modern technology and social media in a way that enables every Indian to take pride in this intellectual heritage of their ancestors.Until this knowledge leads to practical utility for ordinary people, the movement will remain incomplete,” culture minister Gajendra Singh Shekhawat said.While the declaration lays down the broad vision for the roadmap based on the deliberations and recommendations of the eight working groups set up to study various facets – such as conservation, preservation, decoding, digitisation and dissemination of knowledge in the manuscripts, and the deciphering of scripts like the Indus script -- the culture ministry will be putting in place an action plan which paves the way for a policy framework.When asked about the action plan, Shekhawat responded with optimism and toldthat work will be taken up expeditiously on various aspects pertaining to manuscripts.The eight working groups made presentations before the PM at the conference on Friday, and their recommendations will be woven into the action plan, a senior official said.At the conference held under the overarching theme 'Reclaiming India's Knowledge Legacy through Manuscript Heritage', the declaration was adopted by participants that included manuscript custodians, academicians, scholars, conservators, archaeologists, and other experts, including those from the fields of digitisation and technology and archival institutions.","'delhi declaration' adopted to guard & preserve india's priceless manuscript heritage.

Several food items now attract 0% or NIL GST and even life and health insurance will see zero tax.The government has also established comprehensive strategies to track price modifications after reducing GST rates on approximately 400 items.Senior government officials informed TOI that indirect tax authorities are gathering present prices of goods and services to compare them with rates once the new GST structure becomes effective.So what becomes cheaper for you?

(AI image)

New EPFO features soon

EPFO: Safety cover





In a big cheer for Provident Fund or PF subscribers, the Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) may roll out features like withdrawals from ATMs and ban-like transactions ahead of Diwali.The meeting, to be chaired by labour and employment minister Mansukh Mandaviya, is scheduled for October 10-11, although the final agenda remains pending, sources informed ET. The government intends to introduce certain advantages for approximately 80 million EPFO subscribers before Diwali to enhance spending patterns.The EPFO may consider the EPFO 3.0 initiative at its meeting next month, aiming to introduce facilities similar to banking services, including options for withdrawing a portion of provident funds via ATMs or using them for UPI transactions.The organisation's central board of trustees is also expected to review a proposal to increase the minimum pension from Rs 1,000 monthly to between Rs 1,500 and Rs 2,500, addressing a persistent request from trade unions.The apex decision-making authority of EPFO, the Central Board of Trustees, comprises members representing employers, employees, state governments and the central government. The suggestion to enable partial withdrawals via banks and UPI might encounter opposition from trade unions, who consistently maintain that provident funds are meant for retirement security.Trade unions express concern that allowing withdrawals through banking channels could undermine the fundamental purpose of these savings, particularly if used for purposes beyond those currently permitted by regulations, according to the ET report.The Employees' Provident Fund & Miscellaneous Provisions Act currently permits automated withdrawals of up to Rs 5 lakh for specific needs such as health emergencies, educational expenses, matrimonial purposes and housing requirements, with processing completed within three days without manual intervention.The existing withdrawal system requires a minimum of two to three days for processing and relies on NEFT or RTGS transfers. The ATM withdrawal proposition forms part of EPFO's modernisation initiatives, designed to enhance service delivery and accessibility for its account holders.","The epfo may consider the epfo 3.0 initiative at its meeting next month.

5 Key things you missed at Apple iPhone launch event





Following the tragic shooting of President Donald Trump aide Charlie Kirk at a rally in Utah, graphic videos of the incident quickly went viral across major social media platforms, sparking renewed scrutiny over content moderation policies. According to a report by The New York Times, within minutes of the shooting on Wednesday (September 10), videos were posted on Elon Musk 's X and were viewed over 11 million times within two hours. The graphic footage also spread to Meta-owned platforms like Instagram and Threads, as well as YouTube and Telegram, accumulating millions of views.The viral spread of the video has forced major platforms to respond, with varying approaches. Musk-owned X’s official policy prohibits “excessively gory” content but allows it to be posted with a warning label.The company posted online that it “will continue to stand against violence and censorship, ensuring this platform amplifies truth and open dialogue for everyone.”Meanwhile, Musk, who appeared to have seen some of the videos, said in a post, “The shot looked real bad, but I sure hope Charlie makes it somehow.”Google-owned YouTube said that the platform is removing some graphic content and applying age restrictions to other videos to prevent them from being seen by users under 18.“Our hearts are with Charlie Kirk’s family following his tragic death. We are closely monitoring our platform and prominently elevating news content on the homepage, in search and in recommendations to help people stay informed,” the spokesman was quoted as saying.Meta – the parent company of Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp and Threads – declined to comment but some clips on its platforms were found to have been marked as sensitive, while others were not, the report said.Experts say this event continues a long-standing and troubling trend, adding that the proliferation of violent content has become a grim fixture of the internet.“This is the first time such a widely recognised figure has been murdered in such a public way and spread this way on social media,” said Emerson Brooking, director of strategy at the Digital Forensic Research Lab of the Atlantic Council.","Graphic videos of the shooting of president donald trump aide charlie kirk quickly went viral across major social media platforms.

Microsoft’s controversy over Azure and Gaza





Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has told employees that the company needs to “do better” in rebuilding trust with its workforce. The remarks come after months of layoffs and a new return-to-office rule that the company announced recently. When an employee asked Nadella to speak about a perceived lack of empathy in the company’s culture, the Microsoft CEO said “I deeply appreciate that, the question and the sentiment behind it,” as per an audio obtained by CNBC. “I take it as feedback for me and everyone in the leadership team, because at the end of the day, I think we can do better, and we will do better.""According to audio obtained by CNBC, HR chief Amy Coleman acknowledged mixed reactions to the return-to-office mandate during the session. Some employees fear a loss of autonomy, though data shows staff around Seattle already average 2.4 days in the office each week.Nadella acknowledged that remote work can make mentorship harder for new employees and interns. “Management is just mostly all remote, but the interns are all, you know, in one location. And so those are things that just will break a social contract,” he said.Still, Nadella cautioned staff about long-term challenges. “Some of the biggest businesses we built may not be as relevant going forward,” he warned. “Some of the margin that we love today may not be there tomorrow, and that means you have to be way ahead of all of those going away, right?”“We have some very, very hard work ahead of us and that hard process of renewal is essentially what we have to do,” Nadella said.“You have to be hardcore in terms of an intellectual honesty about what really needs to happen.”The meeting also touched on fallout from a Guardian report alleging that Israel’s military used Microsoft’s Azure cloud to store Palestinians’ phone calls during the Gaza conflict. Microsoft has since fired five employees who protested against the company’s involvement.President Brad Smith addressed the issue, saying Microsoft will support Jewish employees who have faced harassment. “We don’t get to control what happens outside Microsoft, but we need to be clear about one thing,” Smith said. “There is no room for antisemitism at Microsoft, and as a company and as a community, we will protect this group and defend them from that.”",Satya nadella warns staff of long-term challenges at microsoft.

Snake problem





Tata Electronics semiconductor manufacturing is encountering an unexpected challenge in the forests of Assam. As Tata Electronics constructs its new chip assembly facility, it is not only about ensuring meeting technical complexities of microchip production but also with the region’s wildlife, particularly Elephants and Snakes.According to a report in the Economic Times, the company is building a massive “Elephant-Proof” wall around its upcoming outsourced semiconductor assembly and test (OSAT) plant in the Morigaon district. The project, which is one of the most significant under the Rs 76,000-crore India Semiconductor Mission, is receiving proactive support from the Assam state government to address these unique logistical challenges.The need for an elephant-proof wall is not just about preventing damage to equipment. Experts told Economic Times that the concern lies in the ground vibrations caused by the elephants' heavy tread. In the world of semiconductor manufacturing, where dimensions are measured in nanometers, even a minor vibration can be catastrophic.“Ground vibrations can cause misalignments in precision equipment, leading to inaccurate measurements, distorted patterns, operational failures and ultimately faulty chips,” the report states.A semiconductor industry veteran told the publication that while vibrations are not a major concern for all OSAT plants, they pose a significant threat to ""fine-pitch assembly,"" a process requiring extremely high precision. “If the vibration shifts it even by half a micron, every pin will get shifted by half a micron, the alignment will go and Tata Electronics may lose yield,” the veteran said.In addition to the elephant problem, the plant is also dealing with an abundance of Snakes. The company has hired a team of rescuers who work full-time to capture and safely relocate the reptiles. ""These people have been there for the last three months and since then have rescued many snakes,"" a source told the newspaper.The state government is taking an active role in supporting the project. According to a state official quoted, the wall is being built ""not just for the elephants but for their security as well.” The official noted that the chief minister, industry department, and chief secretary are personally overseeing the project, ensuring the Tata Group receives full support.The new chip assembly plant, which involves an investment of Rs 27,000 crore, is attracting high-profile attention, with Elon Musk’s Tesla reportedly being a key prospective customer.Experts say that industries such as semiconductor manufacturing require strict vibration control as instruments and processes demand high stability and accuracy to function correctly. Proper foundation design and structural engineering are among the initial defences against vibration.",Tata electronics is building an elephant-proof wall around its upcoming semiconductor plant in assam.

The Matchmaker's Return: How Nandini Brought Ancient Wisdom to Modern Dating,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/the-matchmakers-return-how-nandini-brought-ancient-wisdom-to-modern-dating/articleshow/123877680.cms,"Nandini started building again.





The first time Nandini tried to set someone up was at her eighth standard social at Cathedral School in Mumbai, 2008. She was barely a teenager, but already she understood something that would take the dating app industry decades to figure out: successful matchmaking is about listening.Sixteen years later, Nandini sits in her company’s office, having just raised $7 million for Sitch, an AI-powered matchmaking service that’s challenging the entire premise of modern dating apps. Her journey from teenage cupid to venture-backed founder reveals a deeper truth about technology: sometimes the most innovative solutions look remarkably like ancient wisdom, updated for modern times.“I always joke that with cofounders, just like in your dating life, you gotta have a few ex-boyfriends before you meet your husband,” Nandini says, referring to her previous startup that failed. “Same thing with cofounders. You don’t give up. Real founders keep going against all odds.”This philosophy of persistence through failure has defined Nandini’s approach to entrepreneurship. Her first dating app venture ended in a cofounder split and shutdown, despite showing promise. “I had put my heart and soul in it,” she recalls. “To go from saying ‘I'm gonna be a founder’ to ‘I have nothing to show for it’ was really difficult.”The dating app industry seemed like an unlikely place for innovation. Since Hinge and The League gained traction, few new entrants have achieved meaningful scale or attracted serious institutional investment. The market appeared saturated, dominated by Match Group’s portfolio and a handful of established players.But Nandini identified a fundamental shift happening in consumer behavior. “We’re moving towards Concierge-based services,” she explains. “If I’m trying to get in shape, I’m not figuring it out myself; my trainer gives me a workout and I follow it. Why is it that with dating, we’re like ‘you should be swiping through all these people, figuring out if they’re legitimate’?”This insight led to Sitch’s core proposition: instead of endless swiping, users work with matchmakers who conduct 30-minute onboarding sessions and provide personalized matches based on deep compatibility analysis.The difference becomes clear when Nandini describes what traditional apps miss: “Hinge might know you’re South Asian, but it doesn’t know what kind of South Asian you are, whether you were born in the US, whether you want someone who’s Punjabi from the North. On your Hinge profile, you wrote that you love margaritas and Mexican food. How is that helping determine who you’re gonna marry?”Sitch asks different questions entirely. Instead of favorite restaurants, they want to know if going to restaurants is something you enjoy or if you prefer cooking at home. Whether you’d rather spend money on extravagant holidays or invest in long-term stability. These data points are fundamental to relationship compatibility.“Our secret sauce is the conversation,” Nandini explains. “What is a good matchmaker? A good matchmaker is a good listener.”This approach has resonated beyond Nandini's expectations. The company launched in 2024 and has already expanded to three cities, with waitlists in twelve more. They’re planning to cover all major US cities by early next year, then expand internationally.What’s particularly striking is how Sitch represents a cultural moment where Eastern wisdom is gaining traction in Western markets. “The app getting attention on TechCrunch and CNBC is fundamentally an Indian concept,” Nandini notes. “People in New York are suddenly like ‘maybe I should get a matchmaker, maybe they’ve got it right.’”“This is the biggest decision you’re probably gonna make: who you pick as your life partner,” Nandini argues. “Why should you be making it alone? No man is an island.”The technical challenge lies in scaling personal matchmaking. How do you provide individualized attention to millions of users? Nandini’s answer involves what she calls “productizing myself”: building AI that captures her matchmaking intuition and conversation style.“Someone at a16z said they did the onboarding with the AI and heard me speak, and it’s actually the same,” she recounts. “That’s a really interesting philosophical question we’re asking about who we are and what it means to be human.”This scaling challenge reflects broader questions about AI and automation. Unlike dating apps that can easily accommodate unlimited users, Sitch’s model requires maintaining quality relationships with each member. Success depends on making people feel “seen” and “understood”.The business model also differs fundamentally from existing dating apps. While Match Group profits from keeping users engaged and paying for premium features, Sitch succeeds when people find relationships and leave the platform. This alignment of incentives may prove crucial to long-term sustainability.“Dating apps without institutional funding get bought by Match Group really fast for really cheap, or they never get off the ground,” Nandini observes. This insight influenced their fundraising strategy, targeting multistage investors committed to long-term growth rather than quick exits.The company’s city-by-city expansion strategy reflects Sitch’s hyperlocal approach. Rather than generic national campaigns, they create marketing tailored to each city’s dating culture. San Francisco gets “ChatGPT can’t find you a girlfriend, but I can.” New York focuses on expensive bad first dates. The message adapts, but the core promise remains: we understand you, therefore we understand who you’re looking for.“We’re not looking for similar people,” Nandini clarifies. “We're looking for compatibility. Are the things you want compatible with what this person wants? Are the character traits you’re looking for aligned with what this person offers?”As Sitch prepares for rapid expansion, Nandini faces the founder’s eternal question: how fast can we scale without losing what makes us special? With a team of twelve and ambitious goals to help “millions of people across the world,” the pressure to accelerate growth is constant.“I probably spend most of my time thinking about how we can move faster,” she admits. “Everyone deserves to feel loved, and we want to make sure they get that.”Whether ancient matchmaking wisdom can scale to modern technological demands remains to be seen. Nandini’s journey suggests that sometimes the most innovative path forward involves rediscovering what worked before algorithms took over: the simple but profound act of really listening to what people want, then helping them find it.","Sitch is an ai-powered matchmaking service that’s challenging the premise of modern dating apps.

Who is Diella? Albania appoints world’s first AI minister; public tenders to be ‘100% corruption free’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/who-is-diella-albania-appoints-worlds-first-ai-minister-public-tenders-to-be-100-corruption-free/articleshow/123852634.cms,"



Albania has made global headlines by becoming the first country to appoint an AI-powered minister. The minister, Diella, is designed to fight corruption and bring transparency to public spending.The announcement was made by Prime Minister Edi Rama, who revealed that Diella will oversee all public tenders involving private contractors on government projects.The name Diella, which means “sun” in Albanian, is a “member of the Cabinet who is not present physically but has been created virtually from artificial intelligence,” Rama told AP.Initially launched in January 2025 as a voice assistant on the e-Albania platform, Diella was created to guide citizens through government services. Since then, it has processed more than 36,000 digital documents and delivered close to 1,000 services to citizens.Now elevated to the role of minister, Diella becomes the world’s first AI minister responsible for managing decisions related to government contracts. Rama said that every public tender under Diella’s watch will be “100% corruption-free,” with full transparency on the allocation of funds.The move comes against the backdrop of Albania’s long-standing struggle with corruption.Public tenders in the Balkan nation of 2.8 million people have frequently been plagued by scandals, with international networks allegedly using the country to launder profits from drug and arms trafficking. Reports have often suggested that corruption reached the highest levels of government.By turning to an AI system, the Albanian government hopes to eliminate human bias, prevent quid pro quo arrangements, and reduce the risk of manipulation in state contracts.The appointment is also being viewed in the context of Albania’s ambition to join the European Union by 2030, for which, cracking down on corruption is a vital condition. Experts say that the introduction of Diella could strengthen Albania’s credibility with EU leaders, given that misuse of public funds has long hindered progress in membership talks.While the initiative is seen as groundbreaking, the government has yet to specify whether human oversight will accompany Diella’s decisions. Analysts warn that even advanced AI systems can be open to manipulation if not safeguarded adequately.",Albania has appointed an ai-powered minister to fight corruption.

In Saudi Arabia, the Iqama is more than just a residency permit — it is the central document that governs the life and work of every foreign national living in the Kingdom. From legal status to access to essential services, the Iqama plays a pivotal role in the everyday life of expatriates. This guide breaks down everything about the Iqama, from its purpose and benefits to the detailed process of obtaining and renewing it, including a breakdown of the associated costs.The Iqama is an official residency permit issued by Saudi Arabia’s Ministry of Interior to foreign nationals who live and work in the country. While a person can initially enter the Kingdom on a work visa, they are unable to legally access most services until the Iqama is issued.Once granted, the Iqama acts as proof of legal residency and work authorization. It is essential for accessing basic services and conducting day-to-day transactions in the Kingdom.Though the physical Iqama card is issued for five years, its legal validity depends on annual renewal, closely tied to the employment contract and the sponsoring company. If the sponsoring company ceases operations, the Iqama becomes invalid.In such a case, the expatriate must either find a new sponsor or leave the country.The Iqama issuance process is structured and primarily handled by the employer or business owner acting as the sponsor. Here’s how the process works:Holding an Iqama comes with recurring fees, which are usually covered by the employer. These include issuance charges, work permit fees, and dependent levies for family members.These figures apply annually and may vary if the residency period is shorter. Employers typically bear the full financial responsibility, including repatriation costs if the employment contract ends","The iqama is an official residency permit issued by saudi arabia’s ministry of interior to foreign nationals who live and work in the country.
