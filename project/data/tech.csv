8th Pay Commission: What will be the impact of fitment factor on salary?





Central government employees and pensioners can soon look forward to getting higher salaries and pensions respectively, with the Terms of Reference for the 8th Central Pay Commission being approved by the Cabinet this week.The 8th Central Pay Commission has been tasked with submitting a report in 18 months and the recommendations, once approved by the government, will likely be effective retrospectively from January 1, 2026.According to an ET report, the 7th Pay Commission saw a fitment factor of 2.57 being implemented. The fitment or multiplier factor for the 8th Pay Commission will be known after the commission’s report and government’s approval.Manjeet Singh Patel, who heads the All India NPS Employees Federation as National President, told ET that calculation of new basic pay involves multiplying the existing basic salary with the fitment factor assigned by the latest pay commission.To understand this better: take an example where an individual has a basic pay of Rs 35,000. This when multiplied by a fitment factor of 2.11, results in a new basic salary of Rs 73,850.Also Read | 8th Pay Commission: How much salary & pension hike should central government employees, pensioners expect? Top things to know Nexdigm's Director of Payroll Services, Ramachandran Krishnamoorthy, said that percentage-based allowances like HRA will increase proportionally with the revised basic pay upon notification.He was quoted as saying that fixed benefits such as transport allowance undergo separate reviews and their revisions typically follow several months after the implementation of the 8th Pay Commission's recommendations.Whilst dearness allowance isn't the direct determinant of fitment factor, pay commissions tend to consider the DA rate, which is calculated based on basic pay, as one of the crucial elements whilst establishing the fitment factor.To illustrate, Patel explains that with the current DA at 58% and a projected 12% increase by the time the 8th Pay Commission's recommendations take effect, DA could possibly reach 70%.The government then assesses the growth factor, which previously stood at 24%. The pay commission's calculations also incorporate family units, earlier set at 3 but potentially rising to 4 this time. A shift to 4 family units could result in an additional 13% increase. The fitment factor takes into account all of these things.Patel told ET that whilst the fitment factor influences the basic salary and HRA, the DA resets to zero under a new pay commission. As a result, the overall salary increase for central government employees may typically range between 20-25%.In the context of the 7th Pay Commission, a standard factor of 2.57 was implemented uniformly for all positions, Krishnamoorthy said. Whilst the government might maintain this consistent approach for ease of administration, there exists a possibility of introducing a marginally higher multiplier for lower salary bands to reduce income gaps.Also Read | Husband missing for over 7 years: How wife won a case in Chhattisgarh High Court to get central government pension - ruling explained According to Patel, senior-level staff have increased opportunities for career advancement compared to junior staff. Therefore, the commission could potentially allocate higher fitment factors to lower-ranking staff and lower factors to senior positions. Additionally, consideration might be given to consolidating certain pay levels to streamline the pay structure.Currently, central government employees are classified across 18 distinct pay levels.For a central government employee with basic pay of Rs 50,000, the revised salary calculation under a 2.0 fitment factor is straightforward.Krishnamoorthy says if the fitment factor is fixed at 2, then the employee's current basic pay of Rs 50,000 under the 7th Pay Commission would be multiplied by it.Also Read | Income Tax department doubts Rs 10 lakh gift - brother gets tax notice for cash received from sisters; how he appealed & won the case This calculation results in a new basic pay of Rs 1,00,000. The employee would be positioned at the nearest higher cell in the revised pay matrix. Additional benefits such as DA, HRA and transport allowance would then be computed based on this new basic salary.According to Krishnamoorthy, pension revisions for central government retirees typically follow the same fitment factor. Using the 2.0 factor as an example, a pensioner currently receiving Rs 30,000 would have their basic pension increased to approximately Rs 60,000, pending final approval and adjustments.","The 8th central pay commission has been tasked with submitting a report in 18 months. Once approved by the government, the recommendations will likely be effective retrospectively from january 1, 2026. The fitment or multiplier factor for the 8th pay commission will be known after the commission’s report.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124940857,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-55594,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Govt on Thursday announced ""some Indian companies"" have got approval from China to import rare earth magnets, to be used in automotive and electronics industries.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said licenses have been issued, which will enable access to the magnets whose procurement had been stopped after China put curbs on their sale earlier this year.MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal on Thursday confirmed that some Indian companies have received licences for importing rare earth magnets from China, while responding to questions on the matter.""As far as the question of the latest talks and relaxations that have happened between the US and China (and) as to how it is going to play into our domain, I will come back to you. We have yet to look at it. I am not aware of the technicalities... But I do confirm that Indian companies have received licenses for importing rare earths from China,"" he said.Jaiswal, however, did not give details of the companies that have received permission. Industry sources said the companies include those that supply components to the automotive and electronics industries.However, the imports come with certain restrictions. These include conditions that the magnets cannot be exported to the US, and cannot be used for defence-related industries.The curbs have impacted the production of automobiles, especially electric cars and two-wheelers with companies petitioning govt to take up the matter with China.Rare earth magnets are the strongest type of permanent magnets commercially available. Their high magnetic strength and resistance to demagnetisation make them indispensable in a range of applications, especially where weight and space are constraints.According to experts, these magnets are made primarily from rare earth elements like neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium - materials that allow for powerful magnetic properties essential in miniaturised and energy-efficient devices. They are typically made from alloys that contain rare earth elements. The most commonly used rare earth magnet is the neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnet.China is estimated to account for about 70% of global rare earth metals mining and holds nearly 90% of the world's rare earth magnet's production. One of the biggest reasons that China dominates the rare earth magnet industry is its control over the entire supply chain, including mining of rare earth ores, separation and refining of rare earth elements (a complex and environmentally sensitive process), and alloy production and magnet manufacturing.Just in the Indian auto industry alone, about 870 tonnes of rare-earth magnets are required to be imported in FY 2025-26 out of the country's estimated overall requirement of 3,600 tonnes.","Mea spokesperson randhir jaiswal said licenses have been issued, which will enable access to the magnets.

NEW DELHI: A day after the TOI report on the problems faced by vehicle owners to complete the Know Your Vehicle (KYV) process for FASTags, National Highways Authority of India on Thursday simplified the process. As per the revised guidelines, FASTag services won't be discontinued for non-compliant vehicles and users will get sufficient opportunities to complete the KYV process.""Under the simplified KYV guidelines, side photographs of car, jeep or van will no longer be required. Only the front picture showing the number plate and FASTag will be required to be uploaded.

It added that in case a user faces difficulties in uploading documents, the issuing bank will proactively contact customers and assist the users, before disconnection.Officials said customers can also lodge complaints or raise queries on the NH helpline number 1033. TOI in its report published on Wednesday highlighted how vehicle owners were facing difficulty in uploading multiple documents online for verification of the FASTag linked to the vehicle.

What is KYV?

The Process

The Pain

If recurring KYCs was not enough, there’s now a KYV that you must go through if you happen to own a vehicle. Short for know your vehicle, this new process that is supposed to sanitise your FASTag is the latest compliance burden to be thrust on Indians.What was the need? Apparently, cases of misuse of FASTags — in some cases by truck drivers who were using tags meant for cars — convinced policy-makers that they needed a nationwide firewall to prevent a bunch of delinquents from misusing FASTags.It was rolled out as a mandatory process, beginning Oct 31, 2024, that requires all FASTag users to submit images of their vehicle and registration certificate to verify that the tag is linked to the correct vehicle. A National Highways Authority of India (NHAI) initiative, KYV was notified by National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI). To prevent fraud. And if you thought this was a one-time process, you’re wrong. The verification must be repeated every three years so that the database stays always updated. Why? The possibility of misuse, and ingenious delinquents finding more ways to bend the system.A govt official explained that instances had emerged of people keeping loose FASTags in their pockets or wallets, instead of fixing them on their vehicle windshields, “leading to misuse”.“In some cases, tags issued for cars were used on trucks to pay lower toll charges. KYV will put an end to such misuse,” said another official.A source said since the main thrust of the FASTag rollout was to increase its usage so that toll collection became digitised, there may have been some laxity on the part of banks while issuing them. A KYV, said officials, will “help sanitise the system”.“Ensuring a FASTag is assigned to and affixed on the correct category of vehicle, and that it remains active, is crucial as we prepare to roll out multi-lane free flow (MLFF) system of tolling in which vehicles will neither need to stop, nor slow down as there will be no physical barriers, said a road transport ministry official.Govt aims to bring all national highways that have four or more lanes under MLFF tolling in the next 4-5 years. Therefore, according to officials, one vehicle, one tag is so important.Asked why not detect and disable fraudulent tags or penalise those using multiple tags on the same vehicle, there were no clear answers.According to the circular issued by NPCI, all FASTags need to comply with KYV norms. The process mandates linking the FASTag to the unique Vehicle Registration Number (VRN) and chassis number. FASTag issuers, meanwhile, need to follow the one-vehicle-one tag mandate and replace all tags that are more than five years old.So, anyone with a FASTag must upload their vehicle registration certificate (RC), take a picture of their vehicle from the front and upload that along with the FASTtag and vehicle registration number, besides a side image with the tag and vehicle axles. All these, mind you, must be clearly visible.Issuers need to verify this with the VAHAN database, customer mobile number, and data entered by the point-of-sale agent. FASTags without a valid KYV will get automatically deactivated.While there is great conviction among decision-makers that KYV is the right way to go, there are unpleasant surprises galore that the process is throwing up for people, from being stopped at toll plazas and being told FASTag isn’t working because of “non-compliance with KYV”, to encountering an upload process that involves multiple rounds of clicking photos and sharing documents. Adding to frustrations is its propensity to get stuck — a backend that is simply not prepared to handle such a mammoth job — and sending harried users back to square one.“I was told by a toll gate attendant that my FASTag isn’t working because KYV hasn’t been completed. So, I stopped and had to go through the entire process of taking photos and uploading documents from the toll plaza, just so I could drive on without a penalty despite having a legal and functional FASTag. Govt talks about ease of life, ease of travel, ease of business, etc. How is this ease of anything?” a Delhi resident who recently had to do a KYV at a toll plaza in NCR asked.Having seen people struggle through this, govt officials have started telling banks they should not deactivate tags without calling up customers and informing them about the KYV norm. Sources said the issuer bank, not NPCI, is involved in backend processing of KYV documents.A senior road transport ministry official admitted the process needs to be made easier for the people. Another official said that having a similar process across bank portals and a helpline to guide people could be useful.",Kyv was notified by national payments corporation of india (npci) to prevent fraud. The verification must be repeated every three years so that the database stays always updated. Fastags without a valid kyv will get automatically deactivated.

Did Erika Kirk really turn down Taylor Swift’s $60 million offer to join Super Bowl’s rival All-American Halftime Show?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/did-erika-kirk-really-turn-down-taylor-swifts-60-million-offer-to-join-super-bowls-rival-all-american-halftime-show/articleshow/124975330.cms,"A viral social media post falsely claimed Taylor Swift offered Erika Kirk sixty million dollars to perform at a Turning Point USA event. Fact-checking reveals no evidence of this offer. The story gained traction online, fueling political debates. Turning Point USA announced its own faith-based halftime show. This incident highlights how misinformation spreads rapidly online.

Viral Facebook post ignites controversy and political speculation

What is the All-American Halftime Show and why is Taylor Swift being linked to it?



A viral Facebook post has taken the internet by storm, claiming that Erika Kirk, widow of Turning Point USA (TPUSA) founder Charlie Kirk, rejected a jaw-dropping $60 million offer from pop icon Taylor Swift to perform at the conservative group’s upcoming All-American Halftime Show. But while the claim has fueled political and cultural debates online, fact-checking reveals that the story is entirely baseless.The rumor began when a Facebook page named Lab Bar alleged that Swift approached Erika Kirk with a multimillion-dollar proposal to appear at TPUSA’s halftime event. The post painted Kirk’s supposed refusal as a “cultural stand,” praising her for “refusing to sell out to Hollywood.”Soon, the claim exploded across social media. Thousands of users shared it with comments applauding Kirk for showing “morality and values,” turning an unverified rumor into a trending talking point. Others used it to frame a broader cultural divide between conservative movements and mainstream entertainment, with Taylor Swift’s name once again pulled into political crossfire.However, investigations quickly found no credible evidence supporting the story. Neither Taylor Swift, TPUSA, nor Erika Kirk have addressed or confirmed the claim. Major outlets and official TPUSA channels have remained silent, and no trace of any such negotiation exists in legitimate sources.The rumor’s origin, an unverified Facebook post, is consistent with a classic case of misinformation that thrives on social polarization.Turning Point USA announced The All-American Halftime Show in October as a faith-based alternative to the Super Bowl halftime show, which this year will feature Bad Bunny. The event, part of TPUSA’s outreach strategy, aims to showcase performers aligned with traditional and faith-centered values.Erika Kirk, who now leads several of TPUSA’s public initiatives following her husband’s passing, remains committed to his legacy. Speaking recently at a university event, she recalled, “Charlie always said he had no money, no connections, and no idea what he was doing, but he obeyed the Lord and built something that mattered.”Despite her public visibility, Kirk has never mentioned Swift or the alleged offer, underscoring that the viral story was nothing more than a digital fabrication amplified by social media outrage.In reality, neither Taylor Swift nor Erika Kirk is at the center of a $60 million clash of values, just another example of how misinformation can turn fiction into trending “news.”Also Read: Plans for kids already in motion as Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce plan their 2026 nuptials","A viral social media post falsely claimed taylor swift offered erika kirk sixty million dollars to perform at a turning point usa event.

Nikki Glaser reveals why jokes about Tom Brady’s son were banned

Tom Brady later admits the roast left his kids “hurt”

When Tom Brady’s Netflix roast aired in May 2024, it was billed as an unfiltered, no-holds-barred look at one of the most accomplished and scrutinized, athletes of all time. Comedians took aim at everything from his divorce from Gisele Bündchen to Deflategate and even plastic surgery rumors. But one topic, surprisingly, was completely off-limits: Brady’s 2018 viral “kiss on the lips” moment with his son.Comedian Nikki Glaser, one of the standout performers at The Greatest Roast of All Time: Tom Brady, recently opened up about what didn’t make the final cut. Speaking on the Comedy Bang Bang podcast, Glaser revealed that the roast’s comedians collectively agreed not to make jokes about Brady’s children, especially the infamous 2018 video in which the NFL star kissed his then-11-year-old son on the lips.“We didn’t joke about the kid thing,” Glaser explained. “Like that was a thing that we all chose … like, we’re not gonna make fun of the kid kissing thing, which is truly all I knew about him. I was obsessed with that kid kissing video. I thought it was so fascinating.”She went on to admit that she had originally written “a bunch of jokes about it,” but producers informed her just days before the show that those jokes had to be cut.“You have to lose 30% of that,” she recalled being told. “All of a sudden this big chunk comes out. You feel OK about it, but you’re like, ‘Why did you sign up for this then?’ But also his kids didn’t ask for it.”While Brady took the event in stride, even laughing at jabs about his personal life, he later told The Pivot Podcast that the roast had emotional consequences. “I liked when the jokes were about me. I thought they were so fun,” he said.“I didn’t like the way they affected my kids. It’s the hardest part about … like the bittersweet aspect of when you do something that you think is one way and then all of a sudden you realize: I wouldn’t do that again because of the way that it actually affected the people that I care about the most in the world.”Despite the controversy, The Roast of Tom Brady became one of Netflix’s most-watched comedy specials of the year, proof that even when boundaries are drawn, the GOAT of football still makes for legendary TV.Also Read: “Raise your kids right”: Kylie Kelce draws a clear line for Cowboys fans planning to trick-or-treat at her residence","Comedians at tom brady's netflix roast collectively avoided jokes about his children.

Ryan Whitney Tells Hilarious Story About Getting Featured On SportsCenter

Ryan Whitney is one of the sports, style, and smart money moves mixing champions. The former NHL defenseman who turned to a media personality has scored big not only on the ice but also in business. He has shifted his success from co-hosting the famous podcast “Spittin’ Chiclets” of Barstool Sports to the launching of the viral Pink Whitney Vodka. Let’s look into Ryan Whitney’s net worth in 2025 and the ways he has built his fortune beyond hockey.Ryan Whitney’s net worth is, as of 2025, estimated from Celebrity Net Worth (October 2024 update) to be between $12 million and $15 million. The largest part of Whitney’s wealth was created during his career in the NHL , where he made over $27 million in contracts, bonuses, and endorsements combined.The Pittsburgh Penguins drafted Whitney, and he later played for some teams, such as the Anaheim Ducks, Edmonton Oilers, and Florida Panthers. The year 2007 was the high point in Whitney’s career when a six-year, $24 million contract extension with Pittsburgh was signed. Although injuries eventually ended his career, Whitney's financial legacy continued after he put down his skates.Retirement in 2015 opened up a new chapter for Whitney, and it was behind the microphone at first.He became a part of Barstool Sports and co-produced “Spittin’ Chiclets”, a hockey podcast that got the love of the fans almost immediately. Ryan’s humor, honesty, and Boston attitude won him the spot of a sports media voice.However, the real jackpot was when Whitney partnered with New Amsterdam Spirits for the production of Pink Whitney Vodka—a pink lemonade-flavored vodka inspired by his favorite cocktail. The article went viral, and Whitney was credited with selling millions of bottles all over North America, plus a hefty $10 million to his income. Whitney has been actively promoting his brand via the NHL, real estate investments, and podcasting lately. This has been a clear sign that even for him, retirement did not mean the end of the winning streak.Ryan Whitney's journey from a $24 million NHL contract through a vodka sensation dominating the liquor market to his current $15 million wealth can be seen as a perfect instance of an athlete reinventing himself—and benefiting from it—long after the last whistle.Also Read: NHL Trade Update: GM Daniel Brière swaps Samu Tuomaala to land young defenseman Christian Kyrou from Dallas Stars","Ryan whitney’s net worth is, as of 2025, estimated from celebrity net worth (october 2024 update) to be between $12 million and $15 million.

Joey Chestnut crushes IShowSpeed in hilarious hot dog showdown on Speed Goes Pro

SPEED GOES PRO, EPISODE 3: JOEY CHESTNUT (Competitive eating)

A Look Back at the Pros IShowSpeed Has Faced So Far

Speed Goes Pro





In the latest chapter of his ambitious new series, IShowSpeed ventures into uncharted territory: competitive eating. Episode 3 of his YouTube show Speed Goes Pro, released on October 29, showcases Speed prepping for a showdown with the greatest in the game, Joey Chestnut. With production by OBB Media and sponsorship from Dick’s Sporting Goods, the episode is both entertaining and surprisingly informative, blending celeb-level training with quirky self-discovery.IShowSpeed may have the energy, the fans, and the fire to take on almost anything, but even he couldn’t handle the legend that is Joey Chestnut. In the latest episode of Speed Goes Pro, Speed went head-to-head with the 17-time Mustard Belt holder in an all-out hot dog eating challenge, and the results were both impressive and hilarious.Before they squared off, Speed tried to earn a little extra help by going through a series of “mini challenges” inspired by Chestnut’s record-breaking feats. From scarfing down pizza and chicken wings to powering through hard-boiled eggs, Speed gave it his all. His determination paid off, ‘sort of’ as he secured a two-minute head start before Chestnut even touched his first hot dog.But as it turns out, two minutes isn’t nearly enough of a cushion against the greatest eater alive.Speed managed to down five hot dogs in three minutes, while Chestnut devoured 11 in just one minute, barely breaking a sweat. The look of disbelief on Speed’s face said it all.

Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes ’ mother, Randi Mahomes, described tight end Travis Kelce ’s fiancée, Taylor Swift , with glowing terms: “Nice,” “genuine,” “perfect,” “sweet,” “couldn’t not love her!” In a recent video shared by Starcade Media, Randi Martin discussed her desire to treat Swift as normally as she treats her own son–barring the stardom factor. She explained that her demeanor towards her son hasn’t changed, and she doesn’t plan on changing it for Swift, the billionaire sensational singer. After watching the video, a fan commented, “Tay getting all shy is so 😭🥹,” and shared a throwback clip from Swift’s appearance on thepodcast. In the clip, Swift kisses Kelce, and Jason Kelce reacts with “Oh my gosh!” while Swift shyly chuckles.Randi Martin shared in the video that after seeing Swift’s involvement with her own family, including her children—Patrick and Brittany —and her grandchildren—Sterling Skye, Bronze, and Golden Raye—she couldn’t stop herself from loving Swift. “She’s been, you know, a perfect, sweet person that has embraced my family, my children, my grandkids, and so, I mean,” Randi shared. “I couldn’t not love her.”While it’s common to feel awkward around celebrities, Randi Mahomes is now so familiar with Taylor Swift that it may be challenging for her to treat the singer like a superstar instead of a family acquaintance. “She’s very nice, very genuine from what I see and from what I’ve learned and gotten to know,” Randi said.“And I just knew from Day 1 that I didn’t meet her, and it’s kind of hard for me to look at Patrick because he’s my son, to know that people get excited about meeting him, it’s still like, ‘Okay, you’re still my son. I don’t look at you that way.’ So, I wanted to be able to treat Taylor or anyone else that came involved just as normal as I would treat or be with anybody. Still, I know I definitely had taught myself that I’m just gonna be the same. I wanna treat her the way Patrick wants to be treated–just normal and not have to feel any type of way.”","Patrick mahomes’ mother, randi martin, described fiancée taylor swift as “nice,” “genuine,’ “perfect, “sweet,‚ “couldn’t not love her!” randi said she wants to treat swift as normally as she treats her own son.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124959011,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-35744,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

What did other streamers like Disguised Toast and Valkyrae say?





Streamer Nina Lin has been banned on Twitch again after new clips of her went viral online. Her Twitch page now shows the message, “This channel is temporarily unavailable due to a violation of Twitch’s Community Guidelines or Terms of Service. ” This comes just five days after her first ban on October 25, 2025, when she and fellow streamer Zoe Spencer were suspended for their actions toward Said, a production member from FaZe Clan. Twitch had unbanned her the next day, but after more backlash and new clips, her channel was again taken down on October 30, 2025.On October 25, clips of Nina Lin and Zoe Spencer spread online showing them allegedly touching Said without his consent during a live stream.People on social media called it “sexual assault.” Many users said Twitch should take strict action. Later, Nina Lin went live to talk about it. She said she was sorry and didn’t mean to hurt anyone.She said, “I’m old enough to own up to what I did wrong. I thought it was a joke. I just thought he was laughing, but yeah, I see it is wrong. What we did was wrong.”But many people didn’t believe her apology. Viewers said Twitch was unfair for letting her return so soon after the first ban.Streamer Disguised Toast also shared his story.

CEO’s AI investment drives workforce reduction strategy

Severance package and support for affected employees





Amazon is preparing to eliminate 800 to 1,000 positions in India as part of a sweeping global restructuring driven by artificial intelligence adoption, The Economic Times reported on Wednesday, marking one of the largest workforce reductions at the e-commerce giant’s Indian operations.The layoffs will span critical functions including finance, human resources, and technology, with employees reporting to Amazon’s global teams facing the steepest cuts, ET reported citing sources. The India job cuts are part of a broader plan to reduce approximately 14,000 corporate roles worldwide, announced by Beth Galetti, Senior Vice President of People Experience and TechnologyWhen contacted about the India-specific layoffs by ET, an Amazon India spokesperson referred to Galetti’s global announcement. In a blog post to employees, Galetti said the cuts aim to reduce bureaucracy, remove organizational layers, and redirect resources toward the company’s “biggest bets.”The restructuring follows CEO Andy Jassy’s June 2025 warning that AI would shrink Amazon’s workforce in coming years. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being today, and more people doing other types of jobs,” Jassy wrote to employees, describing agentic AI as transformative technology that “should change the way our work is done.”Amazon has ramped up AI investments significantly, pouring more than $100 billion into the technology this year compared to $83 billion in 2024. While the company plans continued hiring in AI-related functions, it expects overall workforce reductions as automation handles more tasks previously done by humans.The company employs approximately 1.55 million people globally as of June 30, including roughly 350,000 in corporate roles. This marks Amazon’s second major round of layoffs in recent years, following the elimination of 27,000 positions between late 2022 and early 2023.Most affected employees will receive 90 days to seek internal positions, with recruiting teams prioritizing internal candidates. Those unable to secure new roles within Amazon will receive severance packages, outplacement services, and continued health insurance benefits.Despite strong business performance, Galetti emphasized that rapid technological change necessitates leaner organizational structures to maintain competitive speed and innovation in an AI-transformed landscape.","Amazon is preparing to eliminate 800 to 1,000 positions in india as part of a sweeping global restructuring driven by artificial intelligence adoption.

Azure service outage: What happened

Satya Nadella Steps Back to Focus on AI: Microsoft’s Major Reorganisation Explained

What went wrong and why





Microsoft Q3 results: Strong growth despite disruption





Microsoft has confirmed that it has fully restored its Azure cloud services after the widespread outage that struck for hours before the company’s scheduled Q3 earnings announcement. The disruption affected critical platforms including Microsoft 365, Outlook, Xbox Live, and Copilot, leaving millions of users across industries temporarily disconnected. As per Microsoft’s Azure Status History, the service outage was caused by a configraution error which triggered cascading failures across multiple regions. The company revealed that it deployed a rollback to a stable configuration which gradually led to service restoration after several hours.As per Microsoft’s Azure Status history, the outage was triggered by a DNS failure in Azure Front Door, a key content delivery and routing service. Between 15:45 UTC on 29 October and 00:05 UTC on 30 October 2025, customers and Microsoft services leveraging Azure Front Door (AFD) may have experienced latencies, timeouts, and errors.Affected Azure services include, but are not limited to: App Service, Azure Active Directory B2C, Azure Communication Services, Azure Databricks, Azure Healthcare APIs, Azure Maps, Azure Portal, Azure SQL Database, Azure Virtual Desktop, Container Registry, Media Services, Microsoft Copilot for Security, Microsoft Defender External Attack Surface Management, Microsoft Entra ID (Mobility Management Policy Service, Identity & Access Management, and User Management UX), Microsoft Purview, Microsoft Sentinel (Threat Intelligence), and Video Indexer.Customer configuration changes to AFD remain temporarily blocked. We will notify customers once this block has been lifted. While error rates and latency are back to pre-incident levels, a small number of customers may still be seeing issues and we are still working to mitigate this long tail. Updates will be provided directly via Azure Service Health.An inadvertent tenant configuration change within Azure Front Door (AFD) triggered a widespread service disruption affecting both Microsoft services and customer applications dependent on AFD for global content delivery. The change introduced an invalid or inconsistent configuration state that caused a significant number of AFD nodes to fail to load properly, leading to increased latencies, timeouts, and connection errors for downstream services.As unhealthy nodes dropped out of the global pool, traffic distribution across healthy nodes became imbalanced, amplifying the impact and causing intermittent availability even for regions that were partially healthy. We immediately blocked all further configuration changes to prevent additional propagation of the faulty state and began deploying a ‘last known good’ configuration across the global fleet. Recovery required reloading configurations across a large number of nodes and rebalancing traffic gradually to avoid overload conditions as nodes returned to service. This deliberate, phased recovery was necessary to stabilize the system while restoring scale and ensuring no recurrence of the issue.The trigger was traced to a faulty tenant configuration deployment process. Our protection mechanisms, to validate and block any erroneous deployments, failed due to a software defect which allowed the deployment to bypass safety validations. Safeguards have since been reviewed and additional validation and rollback controls have been immediately implemented to prevent similar issues in the future.Microsoft reported strong Q3 earnings despite the massive Azure service outage. The company announced that it witnessed significant growth from its Intelligent Cloud segment with Azure maintaining double-digit growth. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, also stressed on the fact that the company’s commitment to resilience and innovation, noting that Copilot adoption across Microsoft 365 and Bing continues to accelerate.","Microsoft confirmed that it has fully restored its azure cloud services.

Read Tesla Board chairman's 'SOS letter' to shareholders on Elon Musk,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/read-tesla-board-chairmans-sos-letter-to-shareholders-on-elon-musk/articleshow/124895403.cms,"Dear Fellow Shareholders,

As you know, Tesla is at a critical inflection point, and we need your vote to help determine the future direction of our evolving company. Your vote matters, and the deadline for voting is 11:59pm ET on November 5th. The fundamental question for shareholders at this year's Annual Meeting is simple:

Do you want to retain Elon as Tesla's CEO and motivate him to drive Tesla to become the leading provider of autonomous solutions and the most valuable company in the world?

Kathleen and I engaged in a rigorous, seven-month Special Committee process resulting in a highly customized performance plan that aligns shareholder value and measurable business outcomes with the interests of our CEO.

Our goal was two-fold: (1) retain and incentivize Elon to capitalize on the unique opportunities that lie ahead for Tesla and (2) do so in a manner that promotes the development of products and services that will propel our world toward a cleaner, safer, and more prosperous future while creating unparalleled value for our shareholders.

We've done this by challenging Elon with the potential to secure what he values most—meaningful voting influence—conditioned on his commitment to continue leading Tesla for at least another 7.5 years while successfully driving our company to ambitious new heights.

The bottom line is simple: Elon is rewarded only if and when he delivers extraordinary performance that benefits all Tesla shareholders.

When negotiating this performance award, we necessarily considered what Tesla's future without Elon would look like, and we did not believe it was the future that our shareholders deserve. At a time when companies—both big and small—are competing to be the first to bring groundbreaking AI technologies to market, we could not risk losing the best leader in the industry to put Tesla on top.

Now is a pivotal moment for our company to emerge as a leader in AI, and with our exceptional CEO at the helm, we are perfectly positioned to seize it.

Though it's no question that Elon has other pursuits, he has proven that one of the many things that make him unique is his ability to stretch his capacity beyond normal limits and remain successful at Tesla. However, if we fail to foster an environment that motivates Elon to achieve great things through an equitable pay-for-performance plan, we run the risk that he gives up his executive position, and Tesla may lose his time, talent and vision, which have been essential to delivering extraordinary shareholder returns.

Without Elon, Tesla could lose significant value, as our company may no longer be valued for what we aim to become: a transformative force reimagining the fundamental building blocks of mobility, energy and labor, with products such as FSD and Optimus, and working to better humanity in the process. While there may be nothing wrong with being just another car company, our Board believes that Tesla can be more, that our shareholders deserve more, and that Elon is the right leader to help us achieve our full potential.

Elon's leadership is also built upon the critical support of our ""tailor made"" governance structure, including our carefully constructed Board. Good governance should be customized to the company, not applied with a ""cookie cutter"" approach, and it is exemplified by the results that Tesla has delivered, and this Board has overseen. We therefore ask you to vote ""for"" the three members of the Board—Ira, Kathleen and Joe—who are up for re-election to ensure that the Board, which has worked alongside Elon for years, complementing and enhancing his efforts to deliver extraordinary shareholder returns, remains in place.

That is why your vote is so consequential to the future of our company. A vote here is both an endorsement of Elon's vision and a vote for Tesla's carefully tailored strategy and governance. I urge you to support Proposal One, which ensures the continued leadership and support of our outstanding and experienced directors, as well as Proposals Three and Four, which aim to keep Elon focused on our mission here at Tesla.

I feel strongly—as do the rest of my colleagues on our Board—that Elon singularly possesses the leadership characteristics and technical manufacturing know-how to keep us on the path towards maximizing long-term shareholder value as well as social good.

We at Tesla are laser focused on exceptional performance—not promises—and we structure our awards in line with this principle.

If you care about building a better world for humanity and supporting our vision for Sustainable Abundance—then you should vote ""FOR"" Proposals One, Three and Four.

If you want Tesla to have a shot at becoming the world's most valuable company—then you should vote ""FOR"" Proposals One, Three and Four.

Please read the Special Committee Report, which is attached to this year's proxy statement, for a more detailed explanation of Kathleen's and my work in coming to the essential conclusions embodied in the proxy statement and how we structured this performance plan to align Elon's incentives with delivering extraordinary performance for all of you.

Thank you for your continued support of Tesla.

Very truly yours,

Robyn Denholm Chairperson of the Board





Tesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm has issued an urgent appeal to shareholders ahead of the November 6 annual meeting, warning the company could lose significant value if they reject CEO Elon Musk 's proposed $1 trillion compensation package. In a letter sent earlier this week, Denholm cautioned that without the pay plan, Tesla risks losing Musk's ""time, talent and vision"" as he could step down from his executive position or become less engaged with the company. Denholm confirmed she's had direct conversations with Musk about his potential departure, stating there's a ""high probability"" he would back away if the package isn't approved.The unprecedented compensation package includes 12 tranches of stock options tied to ambitious milestones, culminating in Tesla achieving an $8.5 trillion market capitalization—more than quadruple its current $1.44 trillion valuation. Other targets include delivering 20 million vehicles, deploying 10 million FSD subscriptions, delivering one million robots, and operating one million robotaxis.Major proxy advisory firms ISS and Glass Lewis have recommended shareholders vote against the package, citing concerns about its excessive size and board independence. Musk dismissed the advisors as ""corporate terrorists"" during Tesla's recent earnings call.Shareholders must cast their votes by 11:59 p.m. ET on November 5, with the meeting scheduled for the following day.Read Tesla Board Chair Robyn Denholm’s letter to shareholders","Tesla is at a critical inflection point, and we need your vote to help determine the future direction of our evolving company.

China has shut Nvidia out

Nvidia CEO praises Donald Trump

Trump, Xi Defuse Tariff Time Bomb? U.S. & China Edge Towards Ending Trade War | Global Pulse





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang came to Washington with a message for the Donald Trump administration. Speaking at he first Nvidia developers' conference, Nvidia CEO cautioned the US government that America cannot win the AI battle if the world, if China fully excludes Nvidia from its vast developer ecosystem. Highlighting Beijing's effective shutdown of Nvidia's operations in the world's second-largest economy, Huang urged US policymakers to reconsider restrictions that could result in Nvidia cede half the planet's AI talent to domestic rivals.""They've made it very clear that they don't want Nvidia to be there right now,"" Huang said at a news conference during the GTC event, revealing that Nvidia has not even applied for U.S. export licenses for its latest chips to China due to the hostile stance from Beijing. ""I hope that will change in the future because I think China is a very important market."" He argued that a policy isolating America from China's developers ""hurts us more"" in the long term, potentially squandering Nvidia's role in powering global AI infrastructure.This is not the first time that Jensen Huang has spoken about the company's falling market share in China.Speaking at a Citadel Securities event in New York earlier this month, Huang revealed that Nvidia is completely barred from selling its high-performance AI chips, including the A100, H100, and H200 models, to Chinese companies since restrictions began in 2022. He said that he has seen Nvidia's dominance in China’s advanced chip market vanish, with its market share dropping from 95% to Zero due to stringent US export controls.Despite the Chinese blockade -- exacerbated by the US export controls that have changed under successive US administrations -- Nvidia reported $500 billion in bookings for advanced chips and announced seven new supercomputers for the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE). The largest, built with Oracle and featuring 100,000 Blackwell chips, will support nuclear weapons maintenance, fusion energy research, and other national priorities.Jensen Huang credited Trump's ""America First"" policies with revitalizing U.S. manufacturing, noting Nvidia's chip production in Arizona via TSMC, server assembly in Texas, and networking gear in California. ""Putting the weight of the nation behind pro-energy growth completely changed the game,"" he said, thanking Trump directly.The DOE deals underscore Nvidia's pivot to fortified US ties amid China's rejection. Analyst Blake Anderson of Carson Group estimated one supercomputer, ""Solstice,"" could involve $3–4 billion in Nvidia chips alone, though federal discounts may apply from the standard $30,000–$40,000 per Blackwell unit. Huang balanced praise for President Trump who is touring Asia ahead of a Thursday meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, where Nvidia's chips may feature prominently -- with pleas for market access.Trump initially tightened export bans on China-specific AI chips in his second term but reversed in July. Huang has long contended that barring Nvidia from ~$50 billion in annual Chinese sales hampers U.S. R&D funding, even as Chinese developers reportedly still prefer Nvidia over mandated Huawei alternatives.Beyond government wins, Huang unveiled expansions to offset China losses: A $1 billion investment for 2.9% stake in Nokia, plus the ""Arc"" product line to boost 6G base station efficiency for millions of global sites.","China has shut nvidia out of its vast developer ecosystem, ceo jensen huang said.

In a major push to consolidate its presence in the Indian market, OpenAI has announced that it will offer ChatGPT Go free to all users in India starting November 4. For the uninitiated, ChatGPT Go is OpenAI's mid-tier subscription plan for its AI chatbot ChatGPT. The move targets India, which the company identifies as its second-largest and fastest-growing global market. The year-long complimentary access to ChatGPT Go comes as a direct response to similar aggressive user acquisition tactics by rivals Google and Perplexity. Both companies recently waived fees for their premium AI features to appeal to the vast Indian consumer base.OpenAI's decision follows Google's move to make its AI Pro membership, priced at Rs 19,500$, free for students for a year. Similarly, Perplexity partnered with telecom giant Airtel to offer free access to its premium plan, intensifying the battle for AI market share in the country.ChatGPT Go, which initially launched in India in August at an affordable monthly price of Rs 399, was designed as a bridge between the free tier and the more expensive ChatGPT Plus subscription. The free ChatGPT Go tier will provide Indian users with significant benefits, including: Higher message limits; Increased daily image generation and uploads; Longer memory for more personalized and context-aware responses"".Since launching ChatGPT Go in India a few months ago, the adoption and creativity we've seen from users has been inspiring,"" said Nick Turley, Vice President and Head of ChatGPT, in a statement. ""Ahead of our first DevDay Exchange event in India, we’re making ChatGPT Go freely available for a year to help more people across India access and benefit from advanced AI.""OpenAI founder and CEO Sam Altman recently highlighted that India is not only the company’s second-largest market but also its fastest-growing. The company noted that since the introduction of the paid ChatGPT Go tier, its overall paid subscriptions in India have more than doubled, underscoring the demand for advanced AI services. The Go plan has since expanded its reach to nearly 90 markets worldwide.","Chatgpt go is openai's mid-tier subscription plan for its ai chatbot chatgpt.

UAE Emiratisation deadline 2025

Companies with 50 or more employees must ensure that 8% of their skilled workforce are Emirati nationals by the end of 2025.

This requirement is part of a national strategy aiming to reach a 10% Emiratisation rate by the end of 2026.

What is Emiratisation?

Emiratisation fines and MoHRE monitoring

Companies with 50+ staff: Will be required to pay a monthly financial contribution of AED 9,000 for every Emirati not hired to meet the 8% target. This accumulates to AED 108,000 annually per missing employee.

9,000 for every Emirati not hired to meet the 8% target. This accumulates to AED 108,000 annually per missing employee. Companies with 20–49 staff: Those failing to hire the required two Emiratis by the end of 2025 will face a fine of AED 108,000. (This follows a fine of AED 96,000 for missing the 2024 target of hiring one Emirati).

How does Nafis give companies huge financial perks?

Bottom line





With the clock ticking toward December 31, private companies across the UAE are reevaluating recruitment plans, training pipelines, and job structures to align with Emiratisation requirements designed to increase the participation of UAE nationals in the private economy. The Ministry of Human Resources & Emiratisation (MoHRE) has set December 31, 2025 as the firm deadline for private-sector companies to meet their Emiratisation targets. Companies with 50 or more employees are required to increase the number of Emirati nationals in skilled roles by at least 2 percent before the deadline.The Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation (MoHRE) has issued a strict reminder to private sector companies across the UAE: the deadline to comply with the latest Emiratisation targets is December 31, 2025. This initiative is a core component of the UAE's Vision 2030, aimed at boosting the employment of citizens in skilled private sector roles. The requirement involves a 2% annual growth in Emirati staff for skilled positions, broken down into a 1% increase every six months.The primary target structure for large companies is:The mandate has also been expanded to include smaller businesses. Companies employing 20 to 49 workers, particularly those in 14 key economic sectors like Finance, Real Estate, and IT, must hire at least two Emirati citizens by the end of 2025.Emiratisation is a national policy in the UAE aimed at increasing meaningful employment of Emirati citizens across public and private sectors. Its key objectives include boosting the number of UAE nationals in private-sector jobs, reducing reliance on expatriate labour while enhancing workforce diversity, and raising Emiratis’ skills, competitiveness and participation through training, incentives and workplace programmes. The policy is enforced through quotas, monitoring mechanisms and sanctions for non-compliance by employers.Companies that fail to meet these specific quotas by the December 31 deadline will face severe financial penalties starting January 1, 2026.Key Penalties for Non-Compliance:MoHRE has stated its commitment to deal ""firmly with any company proven to have committed fraud."" The ministry has enhanced its surveillance mechanisms, including the use of advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, to detect avoidance strategies such as ""Fake Emiratisation."" This fraudulent practice, where companies hire Emiratis in non-existent or misleading roles solely to hit quotas, can result in fines ranging from AED 20,000 to AED 100,000 per case, as well as legal action and a downgrade of the company's classification within the ministry's system.The Emiratisation initiative is driven by more than just penalties; it is strongly supported by the Nafis program, which provides crucial financial and logistical incentives. For Emirati citizens, Nafis offers direct support, including salary top-ups of up to AED 7,000 monthly and various training programs designed to encourage their entry into the private sector.The program also rewards compliant companies that exceed the mandated targets, allowing them to join schemes like the Emiratisation Partners Club. These incentives offer significant advantages, such as up to an 80% reduction on ministry service fees and priority in securing government procurement contracts.This dual approach has fueled compliance, resulting in a remarkable milestone: as of mid-2025, the number of Emiratis working in the private sector has surpassed 152,000 across 29,000 companies, showcasing unprecedented national engagement. The Ministry of Human Resources and Emiratisation urges all firms to actively utilize the Nafis platform to connect with qualified Emiratis and fulfill their national responsibilities before the year-end deadline.The year-end December 31 deadline this year marks a pivotal and defining moment in the UAE’s ongoing drive to integrate more talented Emiratis into the dynamic private workforce. Companies that fully align with the mandated targets will find significant opportunity in government incentives; those that delay risk financial fines, downgraded status, and the growing possibility of strict legal enforcement.",Uae pushes private sector to boost emirati workforce.

Bangladeshi generic version slashes rare disease drug’s price by 96%,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/bangladeshi-generic-version-slashes-rare-disease-drugs-price-by-96/articleshow/124785805.cms,"Representaive image





Bangladeshi pharmaceutical company Beximco has launched a generic version of a triple combination therapy for a rare genetic disorder. US-based Vertex, which holds the patent for this therapy, charges $325,300 for a year’s treatment while the generic will slash the price by 96% to just $12,775 for adults and about $6,390 for a child per year.Patients of cystic fibrosis, a rare genetic disorder, and their families launched a community-run buyers’ club on Thursday to help patients around the world access the new generic version of the drug.Vertex’s monopoly is estimated to have generated almost $30 billion in profits over ten years just from the sale of the medicine for cystic fibrosis. A 2022 study on production costs of the medicine estimated that it could be produced for $5,700 per patient per year. Beximco is launching the generic version of the triple combination (elexacaftor, tezacaftor and ivacaftor) listed as an essential medicine by the WHO . It is also launching a generic version of ivacaftor, one of the components, as the treatment consists of two tablets of the triple combination and one tablet of ivacaftor every day for adults.“This is a historic moment. We’ve watched children suffer and die while a treatment sat on the shelf, priced out of reach. Today, that changes. We’ve proven that patient power can change what billion-dollar corporations refuse to. Governments must act fast to take all the necessary steps to make this life saving drug available for every eligible patient,” said Gayle Pledger, who leads the global Right to Breathe campaign, which has been working to make this medicine accessible for cystic fibrosis patients.Cystic fibrosis disrupts mucus production in multiple organs, particularly the lungs and digestive system, leading to debilitating symptoms, such as serious chronic respiratory issues and malnutrition. Delayed diagnosis and lack of treatment contribute to an average life expectancy of less than 20 years.Tanya Takewani, mother of a child in India with cystic fibrosis, pointed out that 14 children died in 2024 waiting for treatment. “This drug has been available for more than six years. How many more children must have died in these years? There are 600 patients of cystic fibrosis identified in India. But only 50 of them get treatment under the Patient Assistance Programme. The development of a generic gives us hope,” said Takewani.Chetali Rao, a scientific researcher with Third World Network (TWN), a nonprofit that has been helping to make medicines accessible, said, “When a medicine costs more than life itself, it stops being an innovation, it becomes an exclusion. Trikafta can transform a life-threatening disease like cystic fibrosis into a manageable condition. It must be available and we were determined to find a way to make it affordable. ”This urgency drove TWN, together with patient groups Just Treatment in the UK and Right to Breathe, to approach Beximco with the proposal to develop an affordable generic alternative.","Bangladeshi pharmaceutical company beximco has launched a generic version of a triple combination therapy for a rare genetic disorder.
