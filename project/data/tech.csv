It’s all in the mind

Reporting by Kritika Sharma

Noticed how everyone now divides up life events as pre- and post-Covid? “I used to swim 20 laps a day, but that was pre-Covid.” “I tried that pretzel post-Covid, when I went to Europe.” “He had a breakup, pre-Covid.” “They bought their new house, post-Covid.” It doesn’t matter if it was 2016 or ’19, 2022 or ’24, pre and post-Covid are offered and accepted as satisfactory descriptions. Events before 2020, when the pandemic struck, appear to be behind a giant perimeter wall, giving them an other-worldliness that is unsullied by the scarring pandemic.Tomorrow, March 24, will be five years since the first Covid lockdown was imposed, which was the beginning of a collective effort to survive the pandemic. Our lives today are outcomes of that experience – we live, work, travel, eat and think differently, yet we are much the same. It’s a new version of normal, a Normal 2.0, that marries post-Covid changes to pre-Covid continuity. Team TOI looks at the changes, both tangible and intangible, in these five years.No, we aren’t talking about pandemic babies here. Gurgaon and Noida, Delhi’s two major NCR neighbours, saw a big population jump because of the pandemic. It happened for two main reasons.One, since private offices are mostly in Gurgaon and Noida, many people living in Delhi shifted out to be closer to their workplace and avoid travel. Two, because of pay cuts and the general downturn in incomes, families gave up rented houses in Delhi to move to their flats in Gurgaon or Noida that were lying empty or on rent.Neha and Rohan Mehta, both working in IT, bought an apartment in Gurgaon (Sector 79) in 2022. “We were looking for a peaceful location with good connectivity to our offices,” says Neha. Gurgaon’s population grew along Southern Peripheral Road and Dwarka Expressway, where the city’s new housing is, Noida’s primarily in three hubs – the 100x sectors off Noida Expressway, the 7x sectors and Greater Noida (west).In the absence of a Census, numbers are ballpark. Gurgaon’s population since 2019 is estimated to have grown by around 10 lakh – currently, it’s believed to be 30 lakh-plus. The number of people living in Noida, only in the Noida Authority area, has likely doubled in this period, to an estimated 14 lakh today. Greater Noida’s current population is estimated above 10 lakh, a four-fold jump since 2019.“The pandemic taught us how important open spaces, natural light and good ventilation are,” says Vasant Kumar, GM at a real estate company in Delhi who moved out of his 2-bedroom flat in Najafgarh and shifted to a 4BHK at Jaypee Aman in Noida after the first wave of Covid. “Although Gurgaon is nearer to Najafgarh, Noida offers superior infrastructure and amenities. Our apartment is conveniently located near Pari Chowk, and connectivity is excellent. My commute to South Delhi still takes around 40 minutes, which is the same as it was from Najafgarh. Living conditions here are far better,” he adds.For decades the staple of the real estate market, the 2BHK is now an endangered species in NCR. This is a direct consequence of Covid, which led to a demand for bigger houses because of work from home. A working couple needed two rooms to work from, and the kid needed her own space to attend online classes.The 2BHK was insufficient for this, so they began looking for bigger homes. Today, both in new supply and sales, 3BHKs have far outstripped the 2. Last year, for example, new inventory of 11,779 3BHKs was available in Gurgaon to 2,272 2BHKS. Noida had 1,331 3BHKs to just 10 2BHKs (new supply). Absorption data shows 10,136 3BHKs were sold in Gurgaon in 2024 (to 2,209 2BHKs) and 1,350 3BHKs in Noida (to 181 2BHKs).IT professional Gaurav Soni and his wife, who works in HR, who moved to Amrapali Zodiac Noida last year, said space and location were his main deciding factors. “Our society has two parks on either side, so it’s green and peaceful, which is very important. It is also well-connected. Since I WFH, I need a dedicated space, my wife does too when she needs to connect from home and a third room is needed for my parents who visit from Haridwar,” he saysThe pandemic reshaped the workplace in many ways, but perhaps its most lasting impact is the shift to hybrid mode, which many companies continue till date. Hybrid is predominantly work from office with wfh allowed sporadically (or during weekends for companies that work all week) as a flexible arrangement. Especially for women, this has made a huge difference. For Dwarka resident Iesha Sharma, the ability to work remotely meant she could continue her career without stepping away from her newborn. “If not for wfh, I might have taken a break from work to focus on my child,” she says. Sachin Alug, CEO of NLB Services, an IT company based in Noida says companies with a hybrid work policy have a better talent pool. “Moreover, the hybrid model works toward contributing to overall wellness of employees. Cost saving is another major key factor that has kept this trend alive,” he adds.Many schools too remain in hybrid mode, which allows them to tide over annual problems like pollution spikes and cold and heat waves by switching to online mode instead of suspending classes altogether. But it’s a double-edged sword. Those practising screen-free parenting have had to say goodbye to it. Generally, concern about kids getting hooked to phones has grown. “Devices initially used for online classes are increasingly being used to play games and for entertainment. This has affected structured learning habits. Besides, with online learning, students have the option to respond or ignore virtual lessons, fostering escapism behaviours,” says Neha Sharma, principal of Apeejay School in Noida.Layoffs, financial uncertainty, or just a reassessment of priorities, Covid has put many among us on entirely different professional paths. Noida resident Navraj Joshi (55), for example, is a fulltime yoga instructor today with 150 students. A techie all his life, he was laid off a week after the first lockdown was imposed in March 2020. “I may have been one of the first people in the country to be laid off during the lockdown. I had to borrow money from family and friends just to make ends meet,” he says. Looking for a way to earn, he settled on yoga, which he had done for himself. “I went for a certification course in Rishikesh and decided to teach, charging Rs 1,500 a month. People were happy to pay,” he says.Ankur Singhal (43) didn’t lose his job, but a friend’s passing during Covid left him deeply disturbed. “He had left nothing behind for his family. It struck me, what if the same happened to me?” he says. So Singhal quit and switched to entrepreneurship in 2022. “Covid made me take that leap. I took a franchise of Xero Degrees in Sector 142 in 2022. Encouraged by its success, I acquired a second franchise, Desi Vibes, in Spectrum Mall, in 2023,” he adds.Kalpash Garg, then in his mid-20s, had just relocated from Gurgaon to Bengaluru when the pandemic struck. As layoffs began, Kalpesh found himself without a job in a new city. He returned to Gurgaon and decided to start a cloud kitchen since the demand for home-cooked food was very high during the pandemic. “It was tough. I had limited cash, logistics were difficult and this was already a very competitive market. But focus on quality, hygiene and timely deliveries helped gain a toehold,” says Kalpash, who has found his feet, employs two dozen workers and has only one thing on his mind – expansion.The uncertainties of Covid created new certainties in the mind – a contingency plan is an absolute must. Thus have emerged side gigs, part-time explorations by people in full-time jobs of other career paths. Some are doing it for a little more financial security, some just to keep the door open for a Plan B. Gurgaon resident Amrita Kumar felt the need to diversify her income sources after Covid. “I wanted a second source of income, outside the corporate environment in which I work,” she says. So, she began a home-cooked food service within her society. “Everyday, I cook for myself, so I began cooking a little extra and making money from it. It’s also satisfying doing something I love to do.” Hundreds of people have been taking up online or weekend vocational courses after the pandemic to upskill, either for a side gig or to rise in their current careers. Avnish Singhal, executive vicepresident, India & APAC, of Emeritus, a global organisation that provides online courses, says their learner base in India has grown 30 times compared to pre-Covid. “Upskilling is no longer optional, it’s a necessity for growth and survival in the professional world,” Singhal says. “India is leading the global skilling movement, with 81% of professionals increasing their focus on skill-building in the past year, well above the global average of 61%,” he adds.Whether it’s a fresh pack of mushroom while cooking is already halfway through or a sudden need to take a printout — almost anything you ask comes home in 10 minutes. The 10-minute delivery model, which was a product of the pan -demic, is now an FMCG mainstay, the range of products available to pick from ever-expanding. From haldi to the iPhone, no ask is out of the 10-minute delivery bounds. “One night, my broth -er paid me a sudden visit. I had nothing of his size so I ordered a pair of pajamas and a T-shirt for him online. It arrived in eight minutes,” said Swagatam, a Noida resident. Paresh Parekh, partner and retail tax leader at EY India, says since the onset of the pandemic, Delhi-NCR region has seen a transformation of consumer behaviour. “The post-pandemic phase has seen a meteoric rise in instant delivery services as consumers have grown accustomed to the convenience of having almost anything delivered to their doorsteps in record time. Instant delivery, instant gratification, and hyper-personalisation are the grand troika to emerge during Covid and are only getting stronger. Brands are evolving their target audience, strategy, supply chain, pricing and consumer communication to capture this market, which is unique to India,” explains Parekh. This means the gig economy has exploded. India’s gig workforce is estimated to be around 10 million now. Zomato had over 1.5 million delivery workers on its platform in 2024, co-founder and group CEO Deepinder Goyal revealed in a letter to shareholders.Covid brought the idea of the ‘workation’ to people – since work was anyway remote, one could take a trip with the laptop, attend to work calls from a villa in the hills or a hotel room next to a beach, and soak in the sights once work was done. That’s no longer possible, but hybrid work does allow many to take a day or two of wfh and go on short road trips, which travel companies say is one of the biggest getaway trends to emerge from the pandemic.“The hybrid work model has fundamentally reshaped travel behaviour. We’ve observed a 50% rise in bookings for weekend stays, particularly for destinations within a two-to-four-hour drive from NCR. This trend is no longer limited to holidays or extended weekends but a regular part of the urban lifestyle,” says Nikhil Sharma, MD and COO, South Asia, Radisson Hotel Group. According to MakeMyTrip’s India Travel Trends Report, homestays and villas have seen a sharp rise in demand since the pandemic. Cofounder & group CEO Rajesh Magow says travel within 300km of Delhi-NCR has surged. “People are taking multiple trips a year, so travel has become more frequent than ever. At the same time, experience-driven travel is gaining momentum, immersive stays more rooted in local culture and nature. This shift has established weekend getaways and staycations as mainstream choices.” Kashish Jain, who runs a travel firm in Delhi, says religious tourism has also increased, not just among the elderly but younger travellers heading, to places like Mathura, Vrindavan in UP, Kurukshetra in Haryana, and Pandupol temple in Rajasthan.These days, this is the conversation starter, not what your zodiac sign is. Covid stirred a fitness awakening, most visible in society common areas and parks where people are always walking, jogging, running or exercising. Many use wearables to keep track of the step count, heart rate, calories burnt, and more active, less active or inactive days, among other things. In Noida, the number of registered gyms has surged from just 45 in 2019 to 300 in 2024. Greater Noida West resident Abhishek Kumar said Covid was a wakeup call to get fit. “I weighed 98kg before Covid. Now, I weigh 76kg,” Kumar told TOI. Kumar has joined a running group that participates in marathons. Bhawna Gaur started Super Women Athlete Group (SWAG) in 2020 during the lockdown. Since gyms were shut, SWAG became a group that cycled together and is now a full-fledged fitness community. Noida resident Meenal Pathak, who has been running Mee Studio, a fitness centre, since 2014, says enrolments after the pandemic have shot up. “Before Covid, I primarily taught zumba and pilates to women in the neighborhood. Now, I am teaching yoga to men and women in their 30s, 40s and 50s,” says Meenal. Gurgaon resident Surbhi Mehra (28) began walking when she gained weight during Covid as physical activity reduced with work from home. “It led to other complications, like aches and pains that I started to feel. I am diabetic as well. So I started using a fitness tracker to monitor my daily steps and physical activity,” she says.The nature of corporate health plans has changed since Covid, with many companies now offering OPD covers, free telemedicine consultations, and super top-up insurance plans. Plans also cover mental health support, general tests and wellness tests like vitamin deficiency. “Around 70-80% of employees are opting for topups alongside their basic health plans,” says Dhirendra Singh, HR manager with an IT company. Policybazaar data shows the share of super top-up in health insurance went up from 10.5% of health insurance premiums in FY19 to 34.6% in FY24. “During Covid, there was big demand for online consultations and at-home care, along with additional Covid cover as part of employee wellness and benefits. However, post-Covid, while the need for at-home Covid care diminished, tele/online consultations remained a key part of employee benefits. Among large corporations, 99% offer this benefit to employees and their families. Additionally, HR teams saw a notable rise in employee demand for voluntary parental and top-up policies over the past 2-3 years,” Sajja Praveen Chowdary, director, Policybazaar for business, told TOI.And yet, the biggest change we have seen since Covid is perhaps in the mind. “The pandemic wasn’t just a health crisis, it was a massive psychological shift that forced people to rethink everything from relationships and careers to their sense of purpose,” says Aishwarya Raj, a Delhi-based clinical psychologist. One of the most noticeable changes is heightened focus on health and wellness. But while many have adopted better hygiene and self-care habits, for some, this awareness has led to persistent anxiety. The way people think about work has also changed. Socially, the pandemic acted as a filter. It strengthened some relationships and made others fade away. On a deeper level, it pushed people into existential reflection. I have seen an increase in individuals questioning their purpose, re-evaluating their priorities and seeking therapy, not just for immediate stress, but for long-term emotional resilience. One of my patients, a 60-year-old retired teacher, described it best: ‘Pehle lagta tha ki retirement ke baad sukoon milega, lekin lockdown ne jo dikhaya, uske baad lagta hai ki waqt sirf guzar raha hai, jee nahi rahe hain hum’ (I would think there would be peace after retirement.

A notable absence from Meghan Markle 's Netflix programme was observed as her long-standing friend and Soho House founder Markus Anderson did not make an appearance. Anderson, previously described as the ""second most important man in her life"", has been a significant figure in her social circle.Anderson and the Duchess of Sussex developed their friendship during her time in Toronto whilst she filmed Suits. Although he wasn't responsible for introducing her to Prince Harry , he facilitated their relationship by arranging private meetings at Soho House and coordinating a visit to Babington House in Somerset.Their close relationship was evident through his attendance at her royal wedding and her previous blog posts on The Tig, where she referred to him as ""my loving, supportive, and endlessly fun friend"". Despite other friends such as Abigail Spencer and Delfina Blaquier appearing in With Love, Meghan, Anderson was conspicuously absent. Their last public sighting together was at a friend's baby shower in December.The Daily Mail reported that Anderson's absence from the show is attributed to his extensive business travel commitments. A source indicated that he prefers to avoid publicity, saying, ""He just really is not comfortable in the spotlight... it's not his thing.""Despite receiving harsh critiques, Meghan's Netflix programme is scheduled for a second series later this year. The show, With Love, Meghan, was considered crucial for the Sussexes' Netflix partnership, established in 2020. Their most impactful production remains their Harry & Meghan documentary, which included contentious claims about the royal family.Netflix chief Ted Sarandos recently defended Meghan in an interview with Variety. The 60-year-old executive highlighted her cultural impact, noting how the Harry and Meghan trailer sparked extensive media analysis. He mentioned the immediate sell-out of her featured clothing and accessories, including a Hermes blanket.Meghan is set to launch a new podcast titled Confessions of a Female Founder. On Instagram, she expressed enthusiasm about the project, describing it as ""candid conversations"" with ""amazing women"" about their business journeys. She shared that recording was both ""eye-opening, inspiring...and fun!"" and mentioned incorporating these insights into her own business ventures.","Markus anderson did not make an appearance in with love, meghan.

Santander UK's announcement on Wednesday that it plans to shut a fifth of its branch network has raised concerns about the bank's future in the UK. The move, which could result in around 750 job losses consist of the closure of 95 out of 444 branches by June.The bank which has faced speculation over its long-term presence in the UK, will retain 349 branches, including 290 full-service locations and 36 branches with reduced hours. Like many other UK banks, Santander has been scaling back its physical presence as customers increasingly turn to digital banking, reported news agency Reuters.Since 2019, the bank has reported a 63% rise in digital transactions, while in-branch financial transactions have declined by 61% over the same period. Despite this, the closures have sparked criticism from UK lawmakers, who argue that they harm local businesses and make it more difficult for vulnerable customers in rural areas to access banking services.In response to these concerns, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) introduced new rules in September to make it more difficult for banks to close branches without ensuring that customers have free access to cash alternatives.Santander UK explained that the decision to close branches was part of its strategy to align with customer behaviour. ""As a business, we must move with customers and balance our investment across all the places where we interact with them,"" said the bank. ""Closing a branch is always a very difficult decision, and we spend a great deal of time assessing where and when we do this and how to minimize the impact on our customers.""The bank added that it is consulting with employee unions and will provide support to affected staff, including assistance with finding alternative roles within the bank.In its most recent financial report, Santander UK posted a 38% drop in annual pre-tax profit, totalling £1.33 billion ($1.73 billion) in 2024. The bank employs approximately 18,000 people.Despite reports in January suggesting that Barclays had explored a potential offer for Santander UK's operations, the parent company reiterated last month that its UK unit remains a key part of its globally diversified business strategy and is not for sale.","Santander uk plans to close 95 out of 444 branches by june.

Apple is looking to expand its supplier network in India, and is currently in talks with Wipro Enterprises and Lakshmi Machine Works (LMW), according to several sources familiar with the situation.The American iPhone manufacturer has already established partnerships or is in discussions with various Indian enterprises, including Tata Group, Motherson Group, Aequs and Bharat Forge.""Apple is in advanced talks with Wipro Enterprises and is in preliminary talks with Lakshmi Machine Works as part of their move to de-risk their supply chain,"" a source informed ET. ""They are in talks with these companies to supply parts and components for their supply chain.""Industry sources indicate that Apple's engagement with Indian manufacturers demonstrates the technology company's commitment to strengthening its presence in India, amid ongoing uncertainty regarding Trump's policies.The Wipro Enterprises portfolio includes two main divisions: Wipro Infrastructure Engineering and Wipro Consumer Care and Lighting. The engineering division specialises in hydraulics, water treatment, additive manufacturing, aerospace and automation solutions.The consumer division of Wipro Enterprises focuses on FMCG products across personal care, home care, lighting and switches segments.LMW, based in Coimbatore, operates across various sectors including textile machinery, CNC machines, foundry and castings, and aerospace components and composites.According to Dhruv Shekhar, senior associate at Koan Advisory Group, Apple's strategy to strengthen ties with local suppliers like Wipro Enterprise and Lakshmi Machine Works aims to minimise supply chain risks, reduce costs and improve operational efficiency.Also Read | Turnaround from importer to exporter! India now shipping Apple product components to China & Vietnam ""Apple has been one of the lead participants in the PLI for Large-Scale Electronics Manufacturing (LSEM), contributing to its success by driving significant exports and production volumes,” he was quoted as saying.Shekhar noted that Apple is expected to increase its local connections, particularly with the government considering an electronic components incentive scheme. This approach would help reduce business costs in India whilst supporting the growth of local ecosystem participants both technologically and financially.""Beyond compliance and financial benefits, Apple's localization strategy signals a long-term commitment to India,"" he said. ""By scaling its production base, Apple not only mitigates risks associated with its dependence on China but also positions India as a key node in its global supply chain.""This initiative should be considered alongside other developments. In January, it was reported that Apple was negotiating with Pune-based Bharat Forge, a Kalyani Group company, for potential inclusion in its supply chain. Should the negotiations succeed, Bharat Forge would supply various components, including mechanical parts, to the American technology company.","Apple's engagement with indian manufacturers demonstrates the technology company's commitment to strengthening its presence in india.

This shift is aimed at capturing household bulk buying. However, a note from HSBC, says the move comes with trade-offs, particularly in terms of profitability.New value-focused programmes such as Zepto's Super-Saver, offer deep discounts, but require higher minimum order values - often more than double the usual average order value. While this strategy drives larger basket sizes, HSBC analysts note that it also compresses earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (ebitda) margins, reducing them from around 6% to 3%.It added that market leader Blinkit remains a premium-priced convenience player, avoiding deep discounts in favour of expanding categories and geographical reach. Swiggy Instamart falls somewhere in between the two, with competitive pricing but without the same push into bulk purchases. Zomato's Blinkit does not have a loyalty programme like Zepto Pass or Swiggy One.Quick commerce thrives on high-frequency, low-ticket orders, serving as a supplement to modern retail rather than a replacement. Expanding into the value retail segment could reshape this dynamic. ""BigBasket's original model was this. Now you see even quick commerce looking this way. They are going behind DMart's target group, to beat the perception that quick commerce is priced on the higher side.

Those selling on e-commerce platforms like Amazon and Flipkart have to pay a commission to the platforms for each product sold.Products within the Rs 300 price range make up for a large part of the consumption basket of households, said Amit Nanda, director, selling partner services at Amazon India. For the middle class, which has been bearing the brunt of high inflation, some reduction in prices can help them to spend a little more.""We did an experiment (on seller fees reduction) in Sep last year. That worked. We have just carried it and taken that to full scale. It will enable more businesses to come on Amazon, the current set of sellers to sell more and they can also choose to pass on some of the benefit to the customers,"" Nanda told TOI.Amazon has also slashed shipping fees (applies to all products) for all sellers bringing them down to Rs 65 (starting rate) from Rs 77, besides making some reduction in weight handling fees. The company expects that the changes which will come into effect from April 7 will boost the platform's seller network.Analysts said that the move is partly driven by increasing competition from quick commerce which has already taken a large share of the grocery market from e-commerce and has now expanded to other categories. ""The only way Amazon competes with quick commerce now is variety and pricing. By making changes in fees and offering more benefits to smaller sellers, it is trying to retain and widen its seller base for whom the quick commerce channel is becoming important,"" said Satish Meena, adviser at Datum Intelligence.Amazon has launched its own quick commerce service but it is restricted to parts of Bengaluru as of now and the firm has been late to join the rapid delivery rush, the market for which is led by Zomato's Blinkit, Swiggy Instamart and Zepto.

NEW DELHI: Govt is set to give a major relief to telecom companies - running into thousands of crores of rupees - by waiving off spectrum usage charges (SUC) on airwaves bought through auctions before Sept 2021.The measure will help companies, such as Vodafone Idea, Airtel and Reliance Jio conserve cash as they expand 5G services and continue the work to boost telecom network, an official source told TOI.In June 2022, govt had decided to remove SUC for bandwidth that had been auctioned after Sept 15, 2021 across different frequencies. However, no decision was taken for spectrum bought through auctions before this period.""The move to waive off SUC for spectrum bought through auctions before 2022 is likely to be approved soon. The plan is to give relief to the telecom companies so that their network expansion work continues strongly,"" the source said.It was felt that a competitive bidding process, which went aggressive on many occasions, had already helped the exchequer get the best prices for airwaves and thus there was no need to tax companies more for spectrum.Apart from SUC payout, which ranges around 3-4% of adjusted gross revenue (AGR) of companies, telecom operators pay an 8% licence fee to govt, including 5% towards Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF).""The matter has already been discussed within DoT and relevant ministries and an announcement on the waiver can come soon,"" the source said.One of the biggest beneficiaries of the move is likely to be Vodafone Idea, which is currently under a debt pile in excess of Rs 2 lakh crore. ""It is believed that the company may get a benefit of around Rs 8,000 crore,"" the source said.The waiver also comes at a time when the local companies prepare for entry of Elon Musk in the telecom sector through Starlink's Rs 2-lakh-crore venture. Interestingly, while local companies will see SUC obligations being waived off completely, Starlink will need to pay tax on its spectrum, the source said.""The reason for Starlink and other satellite operators being asked for SUC is that they will get the spectrum on an administrative basis instead of competitive auctions. The thinking is clear that any company getting spectrum through govt allocation at a pre-determined price will need to pay tax on the spectrum,"" the source said.","The measure will help companies, such as vodafone idea, airtel and reliance jio conserve cash as they expand 5g services.

Ben & Jerry’s argued this decision violated the terms of its merger agreement, which requires consultation with an advisory committee from its board before any CEO can be removed.Unilever, headquartered in London, responded on Wednesday, expressing disappointment over the public nature of the dispute.“Regrettably, despite repeated attempts to engage the board and follow the correct process, we are disappointed that the confidentiality of an employee career conversation has been made public,” the company said in a statement.Unilever acquired Ben & Jerry’s in 2000 for $326 million, with the ice cream brand hoping the partnership would strengthen its social mission. However, tensions between the two companies have escalated in recent years.In 2021, Ben & Jerry’s announced it would no longer sell its products in Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. The following year, Unilever sold its Israeli operations to a local company, which continued selling Ben & Jerry’s under its Hebrew and Arabic branding across Israel and the West Bank.Unilever has since revealed plans to spin off its entire ice cream division, including Ben & Jerry’s, by the end of 2025 as part of a wider restructuring. The consumer goods giant also owns brands such as Dove soap and Hellmann’s mayonnaise.The strained relationship took another hit last November when Ben & Jerry’s sued Unilever in a New York federal court, accusing it of attempting to silence the company’s statements supporting Palestinians in the Gaza war.The complaint also alleged that Unilever blocked Ben & Jerry’s from posting about issues it expected to be challenged in a potential second term for Donald Trump, including minimum wage policies, universal healthcare, abortion rights, and climate change.Tuesday’s filing marked an amendment to that ongoing lawsuit, further expanding the gap between the ice cream brand and its parent company.","Ben & jerry's accuses its parent company, unilever, of unlawfully removing its ceo.
