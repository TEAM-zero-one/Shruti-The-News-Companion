Tom Brady continues to remain single ever after being linked to high profile women







Tom Brady and Gisele B√ºndchen went their separate ways in 2022 but the two have been successfully coparenting their two children. While Gisele B√ºndchen now has a new family with Joaquim Valente, Tom Brady remains single. In the last few months, Gisele B√ºndchen has been spotted alongside her boyfriend and her newborn in Florida but now, she stunned her fans in a new outfit.The former Victoria‚Äôs Secret model was spotted showing off her toned body in Florida as she wore a one piece white coloured swimsuit along with a pair of sunglasses and a brown hat.Gisele B√ºndchen was also seen keeping her accessories to a minimum as she wore a necklace and a pair of earrings to complete her look. She was spotted standing on a paddle boat, probably to spend another day soaking up the sun.Ever since her third child was born, Gisele B√ºndchen along with her boyfriend, Joaquim Valente, has been spotted spending weekends relaxing on their yacht as the couple soaked up the sun. They have also been spotted hosting parties for their close friends on their yacht.While Gisele B√ºndchen is seemingly enjoying her new life, it seems like Tom Brady is struggling in his personal life when it comes to dating.Recently, according to Radar Online, a source has revealed that, ""When he is on dates, he just talks about himself and how miserable he is, and women are saying he's not worth the hassle‚Ä¶That is never attractive to the opposite sex. It means he's got too much baggage to attempt another meaningful relationship, or even a fun fling.""Ever since Tom Brady announced his divorce from Gisele B√ºndchen, he has not been able to get into a serious relationship with any of the women he has been linked to. While there were strong rumours of a relationship brewing between Tom Brady and Irina Shayk, things fizzled out pretty quickly.Similarly, there were rumours of reality TV star and famous socialite and entrepreneur, Kim Kardashian and Tom Brady, but again, nothing worked out between the two.For now, Gisele B√ºndchen is enjoying her relaxing and laid back life while Tom Brady is focusing on parenting and work.Also Read: ""He whines about his ex"": Insiders reveal what‚Äôs holding Tom Brady back from moving on after his failed marriage with Gisele B√ºndchen",Gisele b√ºndchen was spotted in a one piece swimsuit in florida.

What Sam Altman really said: AI with ""novel insights"" by 2026

""By 2026, we will likely see the arrival of systems that can figure out novel insights,""

What does ""novel insight"" really mean

An AI race for survival: Other technology giants are not lagging behind

Google DeepMind just released a paper on AlphaEvolve, a coding AI agent that created innovative solutions to challenging math problems, something even accomplished researchers hadn't tried.

Anthropic founder of Claude AI, established a research grant program in May 2025 to support research projects that employ AI to generate scientific hypotheses and conduct experiments.

FutureHouse, founded by ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt, states its AI assisted in an actual scientific breakthrough, though details are kept under wraps.

Lila Sciences, a startup by now-former OpenAI researcher Kenneth Stanley, has raised $200 million to create a lab dedicated to teaching AI models to ask more intelligent scientific questions, a basic prerequisite for insight.

Why 'novel insights' from AI might still be useless, experts say

In a fresh thought-provoking article entitled ""The Gentle Singularity,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has again moved in with a daring prediction: by 2026, artificial intelligence systems will be able to make ""novel insights."" The claim may sound ambiguous in itself, yet in the context of the developing objectives of OpenAI and the wider competitive scene of AI research, it weighs. Altman, who is famous for his futurist vision and bold declarations regarding artificial general intelligence (AGI), presents this forecast as part of an extended evolution of human society, one where AI remakes work, energy, innovation, and even scientific breakthroughs.His essay, released June 10, 2025, is more than prediction; it can be used as an unofficial guide for where OpenAI and its competitors are going next. This race towards AI systems coming up with genuine, new ideas instead of merely recombining present information is becoming the next arms race in technology innovation. With major breakthroughs being achieved by Google DeepMind, Anthropic, and upstart companies such as Lila Sciences and FutureHouse, the stakes are high not just for corporate hegemony but for the future of science itself.Altman's essay describes his vision for the ""gentle singularity,"" an era in which AGI does not destroy or dismantle civilization but rather becomes a productive, evolutionary partner to humans. Perhaps one of the most remarkable things he predicts is this:This matter-of-fact-sounding sentence has huge implications. First of all, it indicates that OpenAI is approaching a level of model capability where artificial intelligence can move past summarization, prediction, or pattern matching and start to think creatively. This is the distinction between an AI that simply reports data and one that adds meaningfully to human knowledge.OpenAI President and co-founder Greg Brockman has recently supported this concept when announcing the o3 and o4-mini models in April 2025. ""These were the first models scientists used to create useful new ideas in their field,"" he declared, suggesting that OpenAI is already developing the kind of AI that Altman described in his essay.The ""novel insight"" in AI is the capability of the AI model to generate new, valuable, and hitherto not thought-provoking ideas or hypotheses. This characteristic stretches much beyond the current realm of capabilities of AI chatbots and big language models that are based on spewing out known facts.Altman's prophetic essay is not isolated. Over the past few months, a host of major players have taken strategic actions in line with the premise of ""novel insight"" creation:Even as the hype sets in, top AI minds remain hesitant. Hugging Face Chief Science Officer Thomas Wolf recently contended that existing models can't pose genuinely new questions, a precondition for any scientific breakthrough. Likewise, Kenneth Stanley himself concedes that the issue is ""fundamentally difficult,"" not merely a matter of computational horsepower but modeling what humans find ""interesting"" or ""meaningful."" Others argue that while AI can recombine existing ideas in surprising ways, it lacks the context to understand why a question matters. This limitation keeps it tethered to patterns, not purpose, reducing its role to augmentation rather than true innovation.Creativity is not just computation, but intuition and judgment areas where AI still lags. This means that even if models can generate new hypotheses, it remains unclear how useful, testable, or correct these insights will be. In science, novelty alone isn't enough; it must be actionable and verifiable. Until AI bridges that gap, its 'insights' may remain intellectually impressive but practically inert.","Openai ceo sam altman predicts that by 2026, artificial intelligence systems will be able to make ""novel insights"" race towards ai systems coming up with genuine, new ideas is becoming the next arms race in technology innovation.

Steve Jobs was brilliant but don‚Äôt copy this 'one habit' of him; warns Pixar's Pete Docter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/steve-jobs-was-brilliant-but-dont-copy-this-one-habit-of-him-warns-pixars-pete-docter/articleshow/121851338.cms,"Steve Jobs was brilliant but don‚Äôt copy this 'one habit' of him; warns Pixar's Pete Docter

Why Steve Jobs told Pixar, ‚ÄúThis Is Not My Business‚Äù - and meant it



Decoding genius: Steve Jobs' ability to distill complexity

Steve Jobs called at 3 AM - Pete Docter says that‚Äôs ‚Äòone habit‚Äô you shouldn‚Äôt copy



Behind the scenes: Pixar's quiet rise to the top

Leadership lessons for today's visionaries

When Steve Jobs bought Pixar from George Lucas in 1986 for $10 million, few could have imagined the impact this would have - both on animation, but ultimately on the future of creative entrepreneurship. Pixar was then a struggling graphics division with limited numbers and grand aspirations. Jobs‚Äô decision was widely considered risky, especially since the company had yet to prove itself as a viable business in the entertainment space. But what unfolded over the next two decades transformed not only the fate of Pixar, but also Jobs‚Äô legacy beyond Apple Fast forward to 2025, and Pixar is one of the world's most legendary animation houses, with a catalog of Oscar winners and a reputation for storytelling greatness. A lot of that, Chief Creative Officer Pete Docter says, had to do with Jobs' none-too-hands-on approach to creative choices but rather with his skill at stepping back. Speaking at the Fast Company Most Innovative Companies Summit, Docter drew from Jobs' distinctive style of leadership, offering never-before-heard perspectives that highlight how restraint, emotional intelligence, and prioritisation guided Pixar's path.Though he was the executive producer and economic lifeline of Pixar, Steve Jobs never attempted to influence the storytelling direction of the studio. Pete Docter, the company's third animator who is now the brains behind movies such as Up and Inside Out, noted that Jobs kept out of his way. ""Steve was really good at saying, 'This is not my business,'"" Docter recalled.This amount of creative trust is not to be found, particularly from a person who's been stereotyped as a micromanager in his early days at Apple. Yet Jobs at Pixar seemed to know that good storytelling took room. He funded the humans, the technology, and the buildings but he never attempted to ""direct the director."" Rather, he listened. He provided counsel when required. He entered not as a general, but as a partner.This methodology enabled Pixar's artists to experiment freely. It created the foundation for the studio's unprecedented success, beginning with Toy Story in 1995, the first computer-animated full-length feature film, and followed up with Finding Nemo, Ratatouille, Up, Inside Out, and Soul.Jobs wasn't only hands-off, he was laser-sharp when it counted. Jobs, Docter said, had a talent for entering into a complicated conversation and, in a matter of minutes, being able to identify the root of the issue. ""He could sit for about five minutes and review what the conversation was actually about,"" Docter said. ""That's not something anyone's born with. It was the result of years of practice.This ability, cutting through noise to locate the signal is what made Jobs such a good strategist, even beyond his comfort zone. Whether it was a meeting regarding server capacity, distribution logistics, or creative tone, Jobs was able to immediately grasp the crux of the problem and challenge his team to crack it.This ability wasn‚Äôt just intellectual, it was emotional. Jobs was able to read the currents in a room, detect underlying tensions, and gently move individuals toward understanding. In a time when numerous leaders are concerned with establishing dominance, Jobs' strength resided in his ability to see what truly counted and to pose the proper questions rather than provide all the solutions.But even visionaries are not perfect and Docter wasn't afraid to call them out. One of Jobs' most infamous tendencies was his lack of respect for boundaries. ‚ÄúHe would call ‚Äî especially the producers ‚Äî at any time, day or night, 3 in the morning, you‚Äôre on vacation, doesn‚Äôt matter,‚Äù Docter revealed. ‚ÄúHe wants to talk to you about it, you‚Äôre on.‚ÄùThis intensity, while sometimes idealized, also produced burnout and stress. Jobs' all-consuming urgency was galvanizing but draining. Docter conceded that he's tried not to inherit that specific habit, although he occasionally sends late-night emails himself too. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs what my wife is trying to get me to stop doing,‚Äù he joked.This story is a cautionary tale: even the greatest leaders need to discover where to set limits. Passion is great but boundaries allow for long-term success.While Pixar's meteoric ascendancy is invariably linked with technical ingenuity and storytelling brilliance, its organizational culture also played a pivotal role. Jobs permitted the studio to forge its own identity even when Disney acquired Pixar for $7.4 billion in 2006, rendering him the largest Disney shareholder at the time.Former Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger once said he expected Jobs to be tough. But instead, he found him to be open-minded and reflective. ‚ÄúWho wouldn‚Äôt want Steve Jobs to have influence over how a company is run?‚Äù Iger told Vanity Fair in an interview.Jobs' commitment to explaining things until they made sense, not mandating decisions by hierarchy, served to maintain Pixar's creative DNA even within the gigantic edifice of Disney. He did not care to win arguments. He craved alignment and that made him an unusual executive in Silicon Valley and Hollywood.In the modern world of high-pressure startups, midnight Slack messages, and always-on culture, Docter‚Äôs reflections offer a timely reminder: the most effective leaders are those who listen more than they talk. Jobs' legacy at Pixar wasn‚Äôt about control, it was about clarity.His genius wasn‚Äôt just in innovation, but in emotional strategy. He could read rooms, empower people, and know when to step back. Yet, his occasional lack of boundaries reminds current leaders that brilliance without empathy can cost relationships and morale.Pete Docter takes Pixar's helm with a more measured hand these days, blending Jobs' wisdom with his own sense of how creative individuals work best. As Pixar keeps pushing the boundaries of great storytelling, its core continues to be based on the culture Jobs helped foster - not by dictating it, but by believing in it.","Steve jobs was brilliant but don‚Äôt copy this 'one habit' of him; warns pixar's pete docter. Jobs was able to read the currents in a room, detect underlying tensions, and gently move individuals toward understanding.

In a significant overhaul of Indian railways' ticketing policy, the Ministry of Railways made it clear that from July 1, 2025, only Aadhaar-verified users will be entitled to reserve tickets under the Tatkal system through the IRCTC portal or mobile application. It is a key step towards stricter digital identity authentication to prevent misuse, bring in more transparency, and ensure the facility of emergency ticketing reaches legitimate passengers.In a sequel to this order, the ministry has also directed an extra OTP-based Aadhaar authentication layer from July 15, 2025, in order to further rationalise the process. The Indian Railways' move, as conveyed to all zonal railway divisions on June 10, 2025, is in light of increasing festival season demand and growing complaints of manipulation of bookings by agents. Here is the entire explanation of the new regulations, implementation schedule, agent restrictions, and booking practical tips all passengers must be aware of.From July 1, Tatkal tickets could only be booked by passengers who have done Aadhaar authentication on IRCTC's website and mobile app.From July 15, 2025, even authenticated users will have to undergo a one-time password (OTP) authentication process associated with their Aadhaar number during every Tatkal booking.With a view to minimizing bulk bookings and ensuring level playing ground for the public:These restrictions will be applied on all zones and directions have been issued to both CRIS (Centre for Railway Information Systems) and IRCTC to enforce these steps by modifying back-end systems and user interfaces.The Railway Ministry has made it clear that the aim is to:The new policy essentially transforms the manner in which emergency train tickets will be secured in India. While Aadhaar verification maximizes transparency and equity, it might also present challenges for those who have not linked their ID with IRCTC or those who are not technologically savvy.

Anthropic on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's statement

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed sharp disagreement with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei ‚Äôs predictions about AI-driven job automation during a press briefing at VivaTech in Paris.

Huang countered that while AI will transform jobs, it will also create new opportunities, citing increased productivity as a driver for hiring. ‚ÄúSome jobs will be obsolete, but many jobs are going to be created,‚Äù he said.In response, an Anthropic spokesperson clarified to Fortune that Amodei has never claimed only Anthropic should build AI. ‚ÄúDario has advocated for a national transparency standard for AI developers ‚Ä¶ so the public and policymakers are aware of the models‚Äô capabilities and risks,‚Äù the statement read.

If u can‚Äôt do great things then do small and simple things in a great way

Real beauty is to be true to oneself that‚Äôs what makes me feel good

Be yourself everyone else is already taken

I don‚Äôt have an attitude problem you have a perception problem

Work hard in silence let your success be your noise

Dream without fear love without limits

Keep calm and let karma finish it

Don‚Äôt tell people your dreams show them

Success is the best revenge for anything

Be so good they can‚Äôt ignore you

I may be wrong but I doubt it

Turn your wounds into wisdom

Live life to the fullest and focus on the positive

Be a voice not an echo

Keep your heels head and standards high

My life my rules my attitude

Make today so awesome that yesterday gets jealous

Life is short make every hair flip fabulous

Be your own kind of beautiful

The best things in life are free The second best are very expensive

Confidence is not they will like me Confidence is I‚Äôll be fine if they don‚Äôt

Collect moments not things

You are enough just as you are

Find yourself and be that

Don‚Äôt be a prisoner of your past Become the architect of your future

Choose people who choose you

Be fearless in pursuing what sets your soul on fire

Elegance is when the inside is as beautiful as the outside

Don‚Äôt stop until you‚Äôre proud

I am not a product of my circumstances I am a product of my decisions

Stay real stay loyal or stay away from me

Life is too short to be serious all the time So if you cant laugh at yourself call me Ill laugh at you

Chase your dreams but always know the road that will lead you home again

Be yourself everyone else is already taken

I don't have an attitude problem you have a perception problem

Work hard in silence let your success be your noise

Dream without fear love without limits

Motivational WhatsApp captions



What you lack in talent can be made up with desire, hustle, and giving 110% all the time.

Do what you can with all you have, wherever you are.

Develop an attitude of gratitude. Say thank you to everyone you meet for everything they do for you.

You are never too old to set another goal or dream a new one.

To see what is right and not do it is a lack of courage.

Reading is to the mind as exercise is to the body.

Fake it until you make it. Act as if you had all the required confidence until it becomes your reality.

The future belongs to the competent. Get good, get better, be the best.

For every reason it‚Äôs not possible, there are hundreds of people who have faced the same circumstances and succeeded.

Be a fountain, not a drain.

Great things never come from comfort zones.

Life is a journey, not a destination.

Life always offers you a second chance. It‚Äôs called tomorrow.

Every new day is another chance to change your life.

Having a soft heart in a cruel world is courage, not weakness.

Be brave. Take risks. Nothing can substitute experience.

Prove yourself to yourself, not to others.

Work for a cause, not applause. Live life to express, not to impress.

When you can‚Äôt change the direction of the wind, adjust your sails.

Why fit in if you‚Äôre born to stand out?

Don‚Äôt take kindness as a sign of weakness.

Minds are like parachutes ‚Äî they only function when open.

Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.

Success doesn‚Äôt come to you, you go to it.

Hustle in silence, let your results make the noise.

Every day is a fresh start ‚Äì make it count.

Dream big. Work hard. Stay focused.

Rise above the storm and you‚Äôll find the sunshine.

The grind never lies.

Your only limit is your mindset.

Make it happen. Shock everyone.

Progress over perfection, always.

Don‚Äôt wait for an opportunity. Create it.

Fuel your hustle with passion.

You weren‚Äôt born to be average.

Prove them wrong ‚Äì every single day.

Stay hungry, stay humble.

Keep going ‚Äì your future self will thank you.

Build a life you don‚Äôt need a vacation from.

The best views come after the hardest climbs.

If you can dream it, you can do it.

This year is yours ‚Äì take the shot.

Your smile is literally the cutest thing I‚Äôve ever seen

I just want to make you happy because you make me happy

You are my today and all of my tomorrows

Emotional WhatsApp captions



I wish I could turn back time and make everything right

The saddest thing is feeling alone in a crowd

I‚Äôm drowning in memories and there‚Äôs no way out

Every heart has a pain only the way of expressing it is different

The hardest part is pretending to be happy

Some days I just want to disappear

It‚Äôs hard to find happiness when you feel like nothing

The silence after an argument is the loudest sound

It hurts when you realize you aren‚Äôt as important to someone as you thought

Saying goodbye to the one you love is like saying goodbye to your own happiness

Sometimes you have to pretend everything is fine when it‚Äôs not

I‚Äôm not okay but I‚Äôll pretend to be

Behind every strong person is a story that left them broken

Loving you was my favorite mistake

It‚Äôs hard to forget someone who was your entire life

I miss the old us

You left without a goodbye and now I‚Äôm left with the pieces

I wish I could stop loving you but my heart refuses to listen

Sometimes the people who are thousands of miles away from you can make you feel better than the ones right beside you

I thought I mattered but I was wrong

I‚Äôm tired of fighting for a love that‚Äôs already gone

The scars you can‚Äôt see are the hardest to heal

Tears speak when the heart can't

Smiling outside, breaking inside

Sometimes silence is the loudest cry

I‚Äôm tired of pretending I‚Äôm fine

Lost in a world that doesn‚Äôt see me

It hurts, but I‚Äôll deal with it

The worst pain is being forgotten

I miss the old me

We were perfect‚Ä¶ until we weren‚Äôt

Crying isn‚Äôt a weakness, it‚Äôs a release

The hardest part is acting like it‚Äôs okay

Some scars never show, but they‚Äôre the deepest

Loved too much, lost too hard

Trust once broken is hard to rebuild

Happiness left and didn‚Äôt say goodbye

I‚Äôm okay‚Ä¶ just tired of everything

When memories hurt more than they heal

Faking smiles is an exhausting job

Some wounds time doesn't heal

I'm not mad, just disappointed

Hope hurts more than letting go

People change, promises break

Missing you is a daily struggle

I wish feelings had an off switch

Loneliness feels louder at night

We said forever, but forever ended early

No more expectations, no more pain

Too broken to be fixed

Love left, emptiness stayed

Heart full of words never said

Simplicity is the keynote of true life

Life is short smile while you still have teeth

Your vibe attracts your tribe

Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations

Life begins at the end of your comfort zone

Stay close to people who feel like sunshine

In the end we only regret the chances we didn‚Äôt take

Life‚Äôs beauty lies in small moments

Life is tough but so are you

Fall in love with taking care of yourself

Live the story you want to tell

Let your life be your message

Live less out of habit more out of intent

You only live once but if you do it right once is enough

Don‚Äôt just exist live

Life is made of moments not milestones

Be the energy you want to attract

Make peace with your past so it doesn‚Äôt spoil your present

The best view comes after the hardest climb

Life rewards the brave

Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans

Live life to the fullest

To live is the rarest thing in the world Most people exist that is all

Life is short and its up to you to make it sweet

In the end its not the years in your life that count Its the life in your years

The purpose of life is to believe to hope and to strive

Life is about making an impact not making an income

Life is straightforward but we insist on complicating it

Life is a journey that must be traveled no matter how bad the roads and accommodations

Life is like riding a bicycle To keep your balance you must keep moving

Life is 10 percent what happens to us and 90 percent how we react to it

Life isn't about finding yourself. It's about creating yourself

Life is too important to be taken seriously

Life is short smile while you still have teeth

Life is a onetime offer use it well

Life is a beautiful struggle

Life is short and it is up to you to make it sweet

Life is a daring adventure or nothing at all

Life is made of ever so many partings welded together

Life is trying things to see if they work

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) has raised concerns that it could take away jobs, especially entry-level roles. But Reid Hoffman , co-founder of LinkedIn believes that young people should not fear AI. Instead, they should use it to their advantage while job hunting. In a video he published on his YouTube channel this week, Hoffman said ‚Äú""You are generation AI. You are AI native. So bringing the fact that you have AI in your tool set is one of the things that makes you enormously attractive‚Äù.Reid Hoffman was responding to questions from college students, many of whom were worried about their job prospects in the AI age. He admitted those fears are valid, but encouraged students to flip the script.‚ÄúYes, it‚Äôs changing the workplace and creating confusion for employers,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúBut it also gives you a chance to show your unique abilities. In teams with older professionals, you might even be the one helping them understand new tools,‚Äù Hoffman stated.Dario Amodei, CEO of AI company Anthropic, recently warned that AI could eliminate up to half of all entry-level office jobs in the next five years. He said this could cause unemployment to rise by 10% to 20%, and added, ‚ÄúMost people don‚Äôt realize this is about to happen.‚ÄùBut top tech figures like Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and investor Mark Cuban strongly disagreed with Amodei‚Äôs view. Speaking at VivaTech 2025, Huang said: ‚ÄúI pretty much disagree with almost everything he says. AI will definitely change jobs ‚Äî it changed mine ‚Äî but it will also create new ones.‚ÄùCuban echoed the same sentiment in a recent social media post, pointing out that even in the past, roles like secretaries and in-office dictation staff were replaced by technology, but new industries and jobs emerged.‚ÄúAI will lead to new companies and increase total employment,‚Äù he wrote in the post.","Linkedin co-founder reid hoffman believes young people should not fear ai.

How to link Aadhaar to IRCTC account for Tatkal booking before the July 1 deadline

Pre-requisites:

An active IRCTC account

Your 12-digit Aadhaar number or Virtual ID

A mobile phone linked with your Aadhaar to receive OTPs

Follow the steps below:

Go to the official IRCTC website and log in with your credentials.

Go to the 'My Account' page and select 'Authenticate User'.

Provide your Aadhaar Number or Virtual ID.

Press 'Verify Details'.

You will receive an OTP on your registered mobile number.

Provide the OTP and authenticate after accepting the consent.

On successful authentication, a success message will be displayed.

How to add Aadhaar-verified passengers to your master list

Click 'Submit'. The status will display as Pending initially.

You may verify status through 'Check pending Aadhaar verification' link.

When verified, their information will be stored and automatically filled up while booking.

Tip

New Tatkal rules effective from July 1, 2025

1. Aadhaar verification becomes mandatory

From July 1, Tatkal tickets can be booked only by users who have validated their Aadhaar number with their IRCTC account.

This will mean that the passengers cannot proceed with Tatkal booking unless their IRCTC account has been Aadhaar linked and is verified through an OTP.

2. More OTP-Based Aadhaar Authentication from July 15

From July 15, even Aadhaar-authenticated users will be asked to perform an OTP-based authentication step associated with their Aadhaar number for every Tatkal booking.

This additional layer is for the purpose of confirming that the user making the booking is the actual account holder and to avoid account abuse or automation-driven manipulation.

3. Restrictions for agents

IRCTC agents will be prevented from booking Tatkal tickets within the first 30 minutes of the booking period.

AC Class (1A, 2A, 3A): Agents prohibited from booking between 10:00 AM and 10:30 AM



Non-AC Class (SL, 2S): Agents prohibited from booking between 11:00 AM and 11:30 AM

Why new Tatkal ticket rules are introduced

Stopping abuse of the Tatkal system by touts, bots, and unofficial agents.

Making room for actual last-minute passengers through eliminating artificial ticket shortages.

Improving online governance by combining Aadhaar-based identity verification with mainstream services.

Developing an honest, transparent system where mass automated bookings do not hold back common users.

In a significant policy change aimed at enhancing transparency, root out fraud, and provide equitable access to emergency train travel, the Ministry of Railways has made comprehensive changes in the Tatkal ticket reservation system that will come into effect from July 1, 2025. As per the new guidelines, only the users who have registered their Aadhaar number with their IRCTC account will be eligible to reserve Tatkal tickets online, ushering a new era of digitally verified travel in India.The shift, issued formally in a directive to all zonal railways on June 10, 2025, is a part of a larger effort to stem the rampant abuse of Tatkal tickets by unauthorized agents and bots. While Indian Railways has supported this step with an added Aadhaar-based OTP authentication level from July 15, 2025, to further robustify the booking process to benefit genuine last-minute travelers, the change is aimed to stem the rampant misuse of Tatkal tickets.To be eligible to book Tatkal tickets after July 1, follow these steps to link your Aadhaar:To make Tatkal booking faster, IRCTC provides the facility to pre-add passengers to your Master List and get them Aadhaar-verified.: Regularly update your Master List to prevent delays during peak Tatkal sessions.To avoid bulk bookings and provide regular users with a reasonable opportunity:The Centre for Railway Information Systems (CRIS) and IRCTC have been asked to make backend technical modifications to ensure these booking windows automatically. The clampdown on middlemen would drastically enhance Tatkal availability for solo passengers.As per Ministry of Railways officials, the primary reasons for the rule amendments are:The ministry underlined the fact that such changes are in concordance with the national policy of ""Digital India"" and aid e-governance and transparency in public-facing services.","How to link aadhaar with irctc account for tatkal booking before the july 1 deadline.

MUMBAI: In its first major fundraising effort since the collapse of its merger with Sony Pictures India, Zee Entertainment Enterprises will raise Rs 2,237 crore from its promoters to finance its growth plans.The company plans to issue up to 16.95 crore convertible warrants at Rs 132 each to Altilis Technologies and Sunbright Mauritius Investments, companies owned by promoters Subhash Chandra and his family, in one or more tranches. Once the warrants are converted into equity within 18 months from the date of allotment, Subhash Chandra and his family's ownership in the broadcaster will increase significantly to 18.39% from 3.99% as of March-end 2025.This will be an important event in Zee's history as the founding family strengthens its control over the company, which has faced takeover threats in the past. The method by which the family is raising Rs 2,237 crore has not been disclosed. Zee's fund-raising initiative comes at a time when it is working to stabilise operations and focus on digital growth after implementing various strategies such as cost-cutting, staff reductions, and investment in new content following the fallout from last year's failed merger with Sony Pictures India. Zee is now looking to build its core business and invest in emerging segments like micro-drama app Bullet.The company has scheduled a shareholder meeting on July 10 to seek approval for the issuance of warrants to its promoters.The warrants are priced higher than the regulatory price of Rs 128.58 each, with the current Zee stock trading at Rs 138 per share. This fundraising plan follows a review of Zee's growth strategies by investment bank JP Morgan, which presented various strategic alternatives to augment and strengthen the company's balance sheet. After considering these alternatives, Zee's board approved the issuance of upto 16.95 crore convertible warrants to promoter group entities on a preferential basis at Rs 132 per warrant.Shubham Shree, representing the promoter group, said: ""The promoters submitted their desire to enhance their shareholding to the board on May 1 when the stock price was at Rs 106.35. However, they remain committed to the company and its business even at the higher price (of Rs 132 per warrant).""","Zee entertainment enterprises will raise rs 2,237 crore from its promoters to finance its growth plans.
