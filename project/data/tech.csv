China's rare earth exports clampdown: Curbs backfire as local magnet makers reel from demand collapse; revenues plunge and inventories pile up despite US deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/chinas-rare-earth-exports-clampdown-curbs-backfire-as-local-magnet-makers-reel-from-demand-collapse-revenues-plunge-and-inventories-pile-up-despite-us-deal/articleshow/122303856.cms,"Share prices rebound, but outlook remains grim

Industry braces for long disruption and possible shakeout

China's rare earth export restrictions seem to be backfiring on its own industry! China’s export restrictions on rare earths have disrupted the global auto supply chain, forced production halts by carmakers, and pushed US President Donald Trump back to the negotiating table—but back in China, the curbs have dealt a fresh blow to struggling Chinese magnet makers.Beijing imposed the restrictions in April in retaliation to US tariffs, severely impacting rare earth and magnet exports just as the domestic economy shows signs of weakness. Electric vehicles (EVs), a key end-use sector, are already facing headwinds, compounding the pain for magnet producers.According to a Reuters report, magnet exports have plunged 75% in the two months following the export controls, and several global automakers were forced to pause production. Although the US and China announced a deal on June 27 to restart rare earth trade flows, implementation is expected to take time.In a post on WeChat just 12 hours after the deal was announced, the state-backed Baotou Rare Earth Products Exchange said inventory was piling up in warehouses and warned that the damage would not be reversed quickly.The Baotou exchange, located in Inner Mongolia—one of China’s major rare earth hubs—described the impact in May as a “crisis” for domestic magnet producers.Despite China producing 90% of the world’s rare earth magnets, export sales remain critical. In 2024, overseas sales accounted for between 18% and 50% of total revenue for the 11 largest publicly listed magnet firms, Reuters reported, citing public filings.“Their sales are now being squeezed from both ends – disrupted exports and flagging domestic demand,” said Ellie Saklatvala, head of metal pricing at commodities information firm Argus. “They have temporarily lost an important part of their customer base, with no certainty about when they will regain it.”Two rare earth magnet producers told Reuters that revenue is expected to fall in 2025, though they declined to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue. One producer said the export curbs would have a “huge impact” on business, while small- and mid-sized players have already slashed production by around 15% in April and May, according to another source.Much like US chipmaker Nvidia, Chinese rare earth firms are caught in the middle of geopolitical crossfire. After an initial share price crash in April, some listed magnet producers have bounced back—but analysts caution the rebound is not backed by industry fundamentals.“I can see various market outlooks, more or less negative depending on the assumptions, but none of them yield a sustainable rise in share price like we’re seeing,” said Cory Combs, head of critical minerals research at Trivium China. He added that many players in the industry are private, limiting the insight that stock prices can offer.Magnet manufacturers are also under pressure at home due to a brutal EV price war, with automakers demanding price cuts from component suppliers. Complicating matters further is the customised nature of most magnet products, which makes them hard to resell domestically. Four sources told Reuters that producers are being forced to store unsold cargoes while they await export licences.Some companies have acknowledged the strain. Baotou Tianhe Magnetics Technology Co flagged potential export revenue risks in its annual report published in late April. Yantai Zhenghai Magnetics said last week that it had received export licences and operations were running normally, while deferring financial details to upcoming filings.However, analysts warn that rare earth trade flows are unlikely to return to pre-restriction levels any time soon.“Looking at China’s recent export controls on other critical minerals – such as antimony – it is clear that it can sometimes take longer than expected for exports to resume and normalise,” said Argus’ Saklatvala, quoted Reuters.China imposed similar export restrictions on germanium and antimony across 2023 and 2024. Despite being mostly used in civilian sectors, which theoretically face fewer licensing hurdles, exports have yet to fully recover, customs data shows. Europe, for instance, is now receiving only a fraction of the antimony it once imported from China, leading to shortages for lead-acid battery manufacturers.David Abraham, an affiliate professor at Boise State University, said the export licence process now involves extensive documentation, leading to delays and added costs. “In some sense, there’s no going back,” he said.With the industry consisting of hundreds of manufacturers, the growing pressures could spark consolidation. “I do not know if Beijing sees that as a bad thing, because further consolidation is helpful for controlling and understanding where materials go,” Abraham added.","China's rare earth export restrictions seem to be backfiring on its own industry.

UAE's ICP Denies Golden Visa Rumours

UAE Golden Visa : Rs 23 Lakh Visa Confusion

Has the UAE launched a new golden visa pilot programme? Reports about UAE launching a pilot programme for a new golden visa have created excitement on social media. However, visa consultants and applicants are confused due to lack of official announcements, leading to doubt and frustration.While Indian media outlets had extensively covered the news about UAE's new golden visa pilot, there had been no coverage in UAE media outlets or the Emirates News Agency, which typically publishes all official announcements. The story had gained significant traction on Indian social media platforms, as affluent Indian citizens have shown keen interest in investment visas and residency programmes in recent years.Nomination-based visa schemes, despite being contentious, have become a preferred option for wealthy families worldwide seeking relocation opportunities for various reasons including taxation, quality of life, and educational prospects.The ICP (Federal Authority for Identity, Citizenship, Customs and Port Security) has finally dismissed claims spread across various media platforms and online sources suggesting that the UAE offers permanent Golden Visas to specific nationalities, according to a Emirates News Agency report.The Authority emphasised that Golden Visa specifications, requirements and guidelines are explicitly outlined in official regulations and government decrees. Those seeking accurate details can access this information through the Authority's official digital platforms, including their website and mobile application.The authority emphasised that legal measures would be taken against organisations disseminating inaccurate details whilst unlawfully soliciting funds from people who wish to establish residence in the UAE. Such entities take advantage of individuals' aspirations for a respectable and stable lifestyle.The possibility of obtaining a permanent visa to relocate to Dubai, a highly sought-after destination, for the cost equivalent to a mid-range SUV, appeared unrealistic, and it turns out that it was a rumour.A prominent Dubai-based golden visa consultant had confirmed to ET that UAE officials have not announced any modifications to Golden Visa regulations permitting Indian nationals to obtain a lifetime Golden Visa for AED 100,000.Speaking to ET from Dubai via telephone, Iqbal Marconi, former chief executive of ECH Group (recognised by Khaleej Times as the region's principal golden visa facilitator), mentioned receiving numerous enquiries from India following the circulation of this information.""I checked with the authorities here, and they say they have no such information. So, the news is likely to be untrue. The only new update they have is that crypto investors won't be considered for the Golden Visa scheme.”“I checked with the GDRFA (General Directorate of Residency and Foreigners Affairs Dubai) also, they too said they don't have any information on this. I also checked with a couple of officials here who are in the same line of work, they also said they don't have any information in this regard,” he added.A senior official, speaking anonymously to the financial daily, had emphasised that UAE visas are not available for purchase. The government may grant Golden Visas based on various criteria, including AED 2 million real estate investments, business ownership, and notable achievements in science, medicine, arts, culture, media, and sports.The Vision Dubai 2033 strategy aims to double the UAE economy, acknowledging population growth as essential for achieving this objective.Also read | UAE rolls out new golden visa: Lifetime residency at Rs 23 lakh, India among first to benefit","Uae's icp has dismissed claims spread across various media platforms and online sources suggesting that the uae offers permanent golden visas to specific nationalities.

NEW DELHI: The central panel on air quality in Delhi-NCR has decided to delay the implementation of the fuel ban on end-of-life (EOL) or overage vehicles in Delhi till November 1, news agency PTI reported.EOL vehicles include diesel vehicles older than 10 years and petrol vehicles older than 15 years.""Direction 89 to be amended. Drive against End-of-Life vehicles in Delhi will now come into force from November 1, along with 5 NCR districts,"" CAQM (Commission for Air Quality Management) official was quoted as saying by the news agency ANI.Earlier, the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) had directed that such vehicles would not be allowed to get fuel in Delhi from July 1, regardless of where they were registered.Last week, Delhi environment minister Manjinder Singh Sirsa wrote to the CAQM requesting it to hold off on the action. He called the move ""premature and potentially counterproductive"", pointing to ""operational and infrastructural challenges"".The CAQM reviewed the issue and decided to delay the enforcement of the directions, news agency PTI quoted sources.The drive will now be launched on November 1 across Delhi and five adjoining high-vehicle-density districts — Gurugram, Faridabad, Ghaziabad, Gautam Budh Nagar and Sonipat.Fuel stations in Delhi have installed Automated Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) cameras to identify EOL vehicles. The camera scans the number plate and checks the vehicle details, such as fuel type, age, and registration, through the VAHAN database.If the system finds a vehicle to be EOL, it alerts the fuel station staff not to refuel it. The violation is recorded and sent to enforcement agencies, who may then take action like impounding or scrapping the vehicle.The decision to postpone the ban followed public discontent and opposition, prompting the Delhi government to request CAQM to delay the rollout.The installation of ANPR cameras in the five neighbouring districts is expected to be completed by October 31, as per PTI report.",The central panel on air quality in delhi-ncr has decided to delay the implementation of the fuel ban on end-of-life (eol) or overage vehicles in delhi till november 1.

Health concerns drive policy shift in Indian IT sector

India's second-largest IT services company Infosys has begun sending personalized warning emails to employees who exceed standard working hours, directly contradicting founder N.R. Narayana Murthy 's recent advocacy for a 70-hour workweek. The Bengaluru-based firm has implemented an automated monitoring system that triggers alerts when employees work beyond 9 hours and 15 minutes daily.""We must work for 9.15 hours a day for five days a week, and if we overshoot this while working remotely, it prompts a trigger,"" an employee told The Economic Times. The company's HR department now tracks remote working hours monthly, sending detailed notifications to staff members who exceed prescribed durations.The monitoring system was introduced following hybrid working arrangements for Infosys's 323,500 employees. When excessive hours are detected, HR sends comprehensive notifications including information about remote working days, total hours worked, and daily averages. The company's workplace policy, implemented in November 2023, requires staff to be present in office for minimum 10 days monthly.""While we appreciate your commitment, we also believe that maintaining a healthy work-life balance is crucial for both your well-being and long-term professional success,"" states the HR communication reviewed by financial dailies. The emails emphasize that prioritizing health and work-life balance benefits both personal wellbeing and professional success.This initiative emerges amid growing concerns about young tech professionals facing health challenges, particularly cardiac issues attributed to irregular dietary and rest patterns. The company's guidance includes specific recommendations: ""Take regular breaks during your workday; Let your manager know if you are feeling overwhelmed or need support with reviewing priorities.""The policy represents a significant departure from Murthy's recent statements calling for Indians to work 70 hours weekly to accelerate economic growth. The move reflects evolving workplace norms in Indian IT sector , where employee mental health and sustainable productivity are gaining prominence over extended working hours.","Infosys has implemented an automated monitoring system that triggers alerts when employees work beyond 9 hours and 15 minutes daily.

Angel Reese and Reebok bring culture and performance together with the Angel Reese 1 debut

Reebok has unveiled the Angel Reese 1, Angel Reeece, the 1st signature shoe of the WNBA star. The sneaker has a white and shiny finish and a performance-based design with the nickname of Reese, well known for its style and brawn elements. As it has not been confirmed when exactly it will be released, fans can anticipate it in 2026 as Reebok is increasingly involved in basketball with the support of such influencers as Shaquille ONeal and Allen Iverson.Since she signed her multi-year extension in October 2024, Chicago Sky forward Angel Reese—already a two-time WNBA All-Star and a fashion icon—has collaborated with Reebok to launch the Angel Reese 1. Designed with her in mind, with her possessing what has been described as her culture-driving energy and style, the shoe features bright iridescent colors that beget both on-court durability as well as street styling. It is not only a pair of sportswear but the means or expression of creativity of Reese, which seemingly finds its representation in a luxurious photoshoot and goes in the aesthetic direction of a bright person.Reebok Basketball, under the leadership of heavyweights Shaquille O’Neal (President) and Allen Iverson (Vice President), has been quietly gaining steam. Reese has just introduced her signature ""AR"" logo—a flowing cursive design with a halo—suggesting the story that shapes the shoe’s identity. With Engine A already out since June 2025 and Reese’s ""Reebok by Angel"" apparel line up and running, this signature sneaker establishes her as a prominent face in the brand’s revival.Although the confirmation of the date of release and pricing of the shoe is still absent, Reebok has indicated that Angel Reese 1 will be released in 2026. With the WNBA season adding spice to the industry, there is an expectation that more tech specs, performance features, and color ways could be launched. TSX is made up of the base which is TPU overlay on engineered mesh meant to insinuate performance style in design, although additional information concerning the performance platform cushioning is not available.Reese’s ascent has been legendary: in her Rookie Year with the Chicago Sky, she set WNBA records, averaging 13.6 points and 13.1 rebounds in 34 games. Off the court, her brand value skyrocketed—she secured deals with Reese’s and Beats by Dre, launched the “Unapologetically Angel” podcast, and became an investor in DC Power Football Club. A fashion trailblazer, Reese was featured on Vogue’s cover and turned heads at the CFDA Awards—not just as an athlete but also as a style icon.Also Read: Gabrielle Union couldn’t hold back after Dwyane Wade revealed what really happened at a 2013 Hollywood party Angel Reese has successfully turned her athletic excellence into a robust brand identity, and with Reebok’s endorsement from icons like Shaquille O’Neal and Allen Iverson, her vision is being validated.

NFL superstar Stefon Diggs , who is dating rapper Cardi B , is already trending on the internet for reputed infidelity just a few months after the two announced their relationship publicly. A string of what looked like screenshots and audio files was released by Instagram model Skymarlenee last week, making quick online waves and casting an ugly shadow over what looked like a new start for Cardi B after she broke up with rapper Offset.The romance between New England Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs and rapper Cardi B had been relatively new to the forefront of pop culture discussions. The pair were initially rumored to be dating in late 2024 and then openly displayed their romance on a prominent outing to a New York Knicks playoff game in May of 2025, where Cardi B was caught kissing Stefon Diggs on the Jumbotron.But it didn't work out.

Pirate Software Denies Fake Voice



JUST NOW: Pirate Software is getting sued. He's done.

A History of Lies?

Persona or Performance?

I reviewed Pirate Software's code. Oh boy...

Twitch streamer, indie game developer and YouTuber Jason “Pirate Software” is back in the internet hot seat, but this time, it’s not about game design or quirky life advice. In a frenzy of conjecture, Pirate Software has been accused of faking his voice, something he finds ludicrous.The controversy ignited where a 30-second excerpt of Pirate Software replying to a chat comment rapidly accumulated views. One viewer curtly asserted, ‘100%, not his usual voice,’ implying Pirate’s unique style of speaking was faked either via digitization or acting.Instead of dismissing the jab, Pirate doubled down on it with a typically frank and frustrated reply,""100%, not his normal voice.' How would I maintain it for 12 hours a day? Insane memes. Just go to my next meet and greet, and record me. Like, I'll do one at TwitchCon San Diego. Be there! 'It's the voice chip, of course.' Yeah. 'They'll edit your voice.' I know, dude! They're going to do some weird bulls**t.”His tone betrayed not simply frustration but weariness with a pattern on the internet, individual conjecture masquerading as objective reality, and frequently unfounded.This isn’t the first time Pirate Software’s rhetoric has stoked a firestorm.Among the jokes in a resurfaced podcast clip that he once worked on hacking power plants for the U.S. which stirred envy throughout the tech creator world.The sweeping claim assisted in sketching out the narrative of a hacker-turned-gamedev with an exciting history. It attracted skepticism. Top tech creator Coding Jesus questioned that assertion, asserting it was just another instance of Pirate Software possibly exaggerating qualifications for bragging rights or personal development.The core of the argument isn’t merely the voice. It’s about realness in the creator economy. For developers such as Pirate Software, who combine narrative, broadcasting, and cult game creation, the boundary between themselves and their digital personas can be blurry. Pirate insists there’s no “act” here.In an online age when creators are treated more like celebrities than hobbyists, even something as intimate as your native voice can be up for public debate. For Pirate Software, who built a cult following on candor, coding insight and quirky charm, the suggestion that he’s a phony is an assault on his very essence.","Pirate software has been accused of faking his voice, something he finds ludicrous.

"NHL trade watch: Erik Karlsson deal now more realistic after paid bonus, says Elliotte Friedman",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/nhl-trade-watch-erik-karlsson-deal-now-more-realistic-after-paid-bonus-says-elliotte-friedman/articleshow/122350588.cms,"NHL- Erik Karlsson (Image Via Getty)

32 Thoughts

What this actually means for NHL teams



“The bonus is paid, the actual cash is really down… we’ll see,”

“We’ll see”: It’s not a done deal but the math looks better now

Handle that massive cap hit



Possibly negotiate some salary retention



Make the roster math work long-term



Will Karlsson move again?

Just when you thought the Erik Karlsson trade talk had cooled off, Elliotte Friedman dropped a quiet bomb on the latestpodcast: the bonus on Karlsson’s contract has already been paid, and that changes everything.Karlsson is still carrying a $10 million+ cap hit, which has made moving him tricky for the Penguins. But with his bonus money already paid, the actual dollars owed over the rest of his deal are now way lower than the sticker shock suggests.Friedman said, keeping things vague but clearly signaling that a Karlsson trade is back on the radar.So, for teams who are tight on cash but still want a top-tier defenseman? This is suddenly a very different conversation.Even with the reduced cash, any team trading for Karlsson will need to:That’s why Friedman didn’t say a deal is imminent but the financial piece of the puzzle might be the biggest hurdle that's now cleared.After one full season in Pittsburgh, it’s still unclear whether Karlsson fits the Pens’ longer-term plans or if they’re ready to reset and move that contract elsewhere.For a playoff-ready team looking to add serious blue-line firepower, Karlsson could be a game-changer. And now that the money’s not quite so scary, the phones might start ringing again. Elliotte Friedman’s update just quietly reignited the Erik Karlsson trade market. With the bonus money paid and the real cost lowered, NHL teams are suddenly looking at Karlsson through a very different lens.The cap hit is still huge. But the cash isn’t. That makes this story one to watch closely in the coming weeks.Also read - Leon Draisaitl sends 29 mysterious boxes a year to his former team — the reason is actually heartwarming","The bonus on erik karlsson’s contract has already been paid, and that changes everything.

Apple’s new Indian-origin COO, succeeding Jeff Williams, appointed by Tim Cook",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/who-is-sabih-khan-apples-new-indian-origin-coo-succeeding-jeff-williams-appointed-by-tim-cook/articleshow/122334989.cms,"From Moradabad to Cupertino: Sabih Khan’s rise at Apple

Why Tim Cook chose Sabih Khan

In a major leadership transition at Apple, CEO Tim Cook has appointed Indian-origin executive Sabih Khan as the company’s new Chief Operating Officer (COO), following the planned retirement of longtime operations chief Jeff Williams. Khan, a 30-year Apple veteran, has played a key role in building and managing the company’s global supply chain. Born in Uttar Pradesh’s Moradabad and raised partly in Singapore, Khan's rise to Apple’s No. 2 position marks a historic moment for Indian-origin talent in the global tech industry. Under Sabih Khan’s leadership, Apple is expected to further strengthen its supply chain resilience and sustainability initiatives, especially amid ongoing global challenges such as semiconductor shortages and geopolitical tensions. Here’s everything you need to know about Apple’s new operations head.Sabih Khan was born in 1966 in Moradabad, Uttar Pradesh, before moving with his family to Singapore during his school years. He later relocated to the United States, where he earned dual bachelor's degrees in economics and mechanical engineering from Tufts University, followed by a master’s in mechanical engineering from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. Before joining Apple, Khan worked at GE Plastics as an applications development engineer.He began his journey with Apple in 1995 as part of the procurement team, eventually rising through the ranks to become Senior Vice President of Operations in 2019. In this role, Khan has overseen Apple's global supply chain, manufacturing, procurement, logistics, and product fulfillment. His leadership also extended to Apple’s supplier responsibility programs, focusing on worker rights and environmental sustainability.According to a statement released by Apple, Jeff Williams will transition his responsibilities to Khan by the end of the month and retire later this year. In his announcement, Tim Cook praised Khan as a “brilliant strategist” and one of the key architects of Apple’s global supply chain.Cook highlighted Khan’s work in advanced manufacturing, US-based production expansion, and sustainability initiatives, crediting him with helping Apple cut its carbon footprint by over 60%. “Above all, Sabih leads with his heart and his values,” said Cook, expressing full confidence in Khan’s ability to shape Apple’s future.With this move, Apple’s design team will begin reporting directly to Tim Cook, while Khan steps into a role that positions him as one of the most influential leaders in the world’s most valuable company.","Sabih khan was born in 1966 in moradabad, uttar pradesh, before moving with his family to singapore during his school years.

What makes Cardlewise crib special



How the Patil couple created Cradlewise



OpenAI CEO Sam Altman is known for his expertise in the field of artificial intelligence. However, the OpenAI CEO has now become a breakout influencer in the segment of baby technology— all thanks to his social media post on the smart crib. In April this year, Altman posted a personal parenting tip on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter). In the post shared, the OpenAI CEO recommended a smart crib— Cradlewise crib. It is an AI-powered bassinet made by an Indian startup founders Radhika and Bharath Patil. “We bought a lot of silly baby things that we haven’t needed,” Altman wrote. “But I definitely recommend a Cradlewise crib and a lot more burp rags than you think you could possibly need.”Sam Altman shared the post just weeks after he and his partner Oliver Mulherin welcomed their first child. The post sent Cradlewise’s website traffic soaring by over 30% in 24 hours and it also led to a spike on Google searches and sales.Cradlewise crib comes with a price tag of $1,999 and it AI and motion sensors to detect when a baby is about to wake and gently rocks them back to sleep. The smart crib also consists of built-in baby monitor, white noise machine and a mobile app for real-time updates. This makes the crib a very useful device for the parents.Along with this, the crib also learns the sleep pattern of the baby and then offer personalised care by reducing nighttime disruptions. As the baby grows, the bassinet can also be converted into a crib further increasing its utility.The startup was founded in Bengaluru in 2016. Now based in the US, Cradlewise was a result of parenting struggles faced by the Patil couple. Altman’s endorsement, though unsolicited, was a “surreal and humbling moment,” co-founder Radhika Patil told Business Insider.""But more than the numbers, what stayed with me was seeing a tech visionary resonate with a product built with empathy, intention, and science,"" added Patil.","Cradlewise crib comes with a price tag of $1,999 and it ai and motion sensors to detect when a baby is about to wake and gently rocks them back to sleep.
