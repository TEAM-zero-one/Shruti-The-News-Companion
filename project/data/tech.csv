'Communal reason for not getting work?' Remark by AR Rahman sparks outcry,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/communal-reason-for-not-getting-work-remark-by-ar-rahman-sparks-outcry/articleshow/126629332.cms,"AR Rahman

AR Rahman Responds to Ramayan Controversy, Calls Epic a Story of Values Beyond Religion

Composer A R Rahman's claims that he possibly faced instances of ""communal"" discrimination in the last eight years in Bollywood caused an outcry on Saturday. During an interview with BBC Asian Network, Rahman was asked, "". ..today there's a lot of discrimination against the Tamil community within Bollywood. What was it like in the 1990s. Did you ever face...""Before the question was completed, Rahman answered, ""Maybe I didn't get to know all this stuff. Maybe God concealed all this stuff (laughed). I never felt all those..."" before he went on to say, ""Past eight years, maybe, because the power shift has happened... people who are not creative have the power now to decide things. And this might have been a communal thing also, but not in my face. But I would hear like Chinese whispers that this happened. And they booked you and the music company went and funded the movie and got five composers. And I said, 'Oh, that's great. Rest for me'.""The answer put out verbatim suggested there was a possible communal angle to some producers preferring other musicians. The interview said “you’re very proud of the soundtrack of ‘Chhaava’ and it is a really good soundtrack, but it is a divisive film.”The composer said, “It is… I think it cashed on divisiveness. But I think the core of it is to show bravery.”Interestingly, A R Rahman said that the director insisted on him working for the project. In his words, “The director, I told him like, ‘why do you need me for this?’ He said, ‘We need only you for this’.” ‘Chhaava’, directed by Laxman Utekar, was among biggest hits of 2025.The maestro has won a clutch of National Awards for best music; more recently for ‘Kaatru Veliyidai’ (Tamil, 2017) and ‘Mom’ (Hindi, 2017) and ‘Ponniyin Selvan 1’ (Tamil, 2022).Writer-lyricist Javed Akhtar sought to play down the controversy. Speaking to IANS, Akhtar said, “People in Mumbai have great respect for him. Maybe they think he has got busy with the West (producers). Or they think he is busier with his big shows. Small producers are also scared to approach him. I don’t think there is any communal element.”Bollywood singer Shaan also said there’s unlikely to be any communal angle to the situation. He told IANS, “I have sung so much over the years, yet even I don’t get work at times. But I don’t take it personally, because it is a personal matter; everyone has their own thinking and their own preferences… Rahman saab has a signature style and he is a great composer. His number of fans hasn’t gone down, but are increasing. I don’t think there is any communal or minority angle in music. Music doesn’t work that way.”","A r rahman's claims that he possibly faced instances of ""communal"" discrimination in the last eight years in bollywood caused an outcry on saturday.

Final green light for India’s 1st PPP Earth imaging Sat project likely this week,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/final-green-light-for-indias-1st-ppp-earth-imaging-sat-project-likely-this-week/articleshow/126660465.cms,"BENGALURU: More than four months after India’s space regulator-cum-promoter Indian National Space Promotion and Authorisation Centre (IN-SPACe) announced the winners of India’s first EO Satellite System (EOSS) under PPP, a concession agreement is expected to be signed as early as this week, allowing the winning consortium to finally begin work on ground.“It has taken longer than expected, but the [concession] agreement is now expected to be signed shortly, after which work on the project can finally move from paper to the ground,” a source familiar with the matter confirmed to TOI.TOI had reported in Aug 2025 that the consortium had won the project through a “zero-bid”. While the concession agreement was to be signed within three months, delay in processes will see the agreement be signed this week. Another source said that if all goes as planned it could happen in the “first-half” of this week at Isro headquarters in Bengaluru.The project, which will create a constellation of 12 satellites, assumes importance not only because it has the private sector at its heart, but also in the backdrop of the persistent gap in strategic space assets and demand.The data from the satellites will be used for applications ranging from climate change monitoring and disaster response to agriculture, infrastructure planning, maritime operations, and national security, where there are huge gaps so far as having eyes in the sky is concerned.The consortium of Pixxel Space, Piersight Space, Satsure Analytics India, and Dhruva Space is expected to implement the project through Allied Orbits. IN-SPACe chairman Pawan Goenka had told TOI after announcing the winning consortium that the project would be implemented through a special purpose vehicle (SPV).Over the next four to five years, the consortium is expected to invest more than Rs 1,200 crore to create a constellation of 12 satellites in low-Earth orbit. The project is designed to enhance India’s data sovereignty and reduce dependence on foreign imagery. All satellites will be manufactured in India, launched on Indian rockets, and controlled from ground infrastructure within the country.IN-SPACe described the programme as a paradigm shift in India’s space policy – one that places private enterprise at the heart of building national capability. As per IN-SPACe: “Satellites will carry a mix of panchromatic, multispectral, hyperspectral, and microwave sensors, capable of delivering high-resolution, analysis-ready geospatial data…”In addition to meeting India’s own needs, the consortium is expected to be allowed to sell analysis-ready data and value-added services commercially.","A concession agreement is expected to be signed as early as this week, allowing the winning consortium to finally begin work on ground.

Advanced version of Nagastra drone used in Op Sindoor developed: Rajnath,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/advanced-version-of-nagastra-drone-used-in-op-sindoor-developed-rajnath/articleshow/126658304.cms,"New Army Video Highlights Operation Sindoor Strikes On Terror Camps And Airbases

NEW DELHI: Defence minister Rajnath Singh revealed on Sunday that an advanced version of the Nagastra drone, which was extensively used during Operation Sindoor to “accurately strike terrorist targets”, has been developed. He said that the Nagpur-based Solar Defence and Aerospace Plant, which developed Nagastra, has also developed ‘Bhargavastra’, a micro-missile-based system, having conducted a successful test-launch.Rajnath stressed that the govt is focusing on ensuring that the private sector’s contribution in defence manufacturing reaches 50% or more in coming times.Inaugurating a medium-calibre ammunition manufacturing facility at the company’s plant in Nagpur, Rajnath said, “We witnessed the brilliance of your (company’s) ingenuity in Operation Sindoor. The Nagastra drone developed by this group was successfully deployed. This drone struck precisely those who harboured ill intentions towards our country.” Lauding the development of a more advanced version of Nagastra, the minister said, “One never knows when it might be needed, given that our neighbour is so unpredictable. ”Nagastra-1 is a ‘kamikaze’ (suicide) drone that can search and destroy any target by crashing into it.Bhargavastra, on the other hand, is India's first indigenous, low-cost counter-drone system, developed to neutralise hostile drone swarms using micro-rockets and guided micro-missiles, featuring radar detection of up to 6 km and engagement of up to 2.5 km.The newly inaugurated facility is a fully automated plant manufacturing 30mm ammunition, which is extensively used by the Indian Army and Navy. Rajnath also visited the Pinaka rocket manufacturing facility and flagged off the first tranche of guided Pinaka rockets bound for Armenia.He said that Op Sindoor had lasted for approximately 88 hours, but the sheer scale and intensity of those 88 hours couldn’t be described in words. “In such operations, every minute, every decision and every resource is crucial. If we look around today, we see various kinds of wars. One thing becomes clear: warfare is becoming increasingly complex, and its intensity is constantly increasing. In such a situation, preparation for wars should be done on a war footing. ”Rajnath recalled the time when ammunition shortages hampered the country’s defence preparedness, making the govt realise the need to become self-reliant in the field. Commending the contribution of private enterprises to making the defence sector ‘Aatmanirbhar’, he said the nation is steadily marching forward in ammunition production, manufacturing quality and reliable products. “In such a situation, increased involvement of the private sector in manufacturing and research & development is the need of the hour,” he added.","Nagastra drone was extensively used during operation sindoor to ‘accurately strike terrorist targets’ rajnath singh said that the nagpur-based solar defence and aerospace plant has also developed ‘bhargavastra’, a micro-missile-based system.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-126658262,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1487587,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work”

Who was Thomas Alva Edison



What this Thomas Edison quote means



“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.”

Why this quote still matters



How people relate to it today







People remember Thomas A. Edison as one of the most important inventors. He worked on a lot of ideas and had thousands of patents over the course of his life. Many of his inventions are now a part of daily life, like the electric light bulb and sound recording devices. But Edison was known for more than just what he made. People also knew how he thought about work, hard work, and success., is one of the most popular things he has said. Edison talks about a simple habit that a lot of people have. People often look for opportunities in things that seem fun, easy, or rewarding right away. It's easier to ignore something when it looks hard or requires a lot of work. Edison thought this was where a lot of people went wrong. He says that opportunities don't usually come in a polished or attractive way. Instead, it often comes in a quiet way that looks like work that needs to be done.Thomas Alva Edison was born in 1847 in the US. He was curious about how things worked from a young age. As he got older, this curiosity turned into a habit of trying new things and making old ones better. Edison worked on many projects at once and thought that progress came from working hard over and over again instead of getting quick results.Some of the most important things he invented were the electric light bulb, phonograph, and the motion picture camera. He also built labs where groups of people could work together on long-term experiments. Edison thought that being patient, testing things out, and working hard every day were all important parts of coming up with new ideas. A lot of historical records say that he saw innovation as a normal part of his job, not a flash of genius.Edison said,He was using a simple picture to explain a common reaction. Overalls are clothes that people wear to do physical or practical work. Edison used this picture to show that opportunities often seem normal and hard to get.A lot of people think that success will come quickly or with little work. They might want results right away, without having to learn, practice, or fail along the way. Edison said that real opportunities usually require work first and pay off later. Because of this, people sometimes miss out on chances that could have helped them grow.This idea is still important because it shows how people make choices every day. Students might not want to study subjects that need more practice. Workers might not want to do tasks that seem hard. People may put off their personal goals if they seem hard or uncertain. Edison's words remind readers that trying hard doesn't mean you've failed; it usually means that something important is possible.The quote tells people to think about work in a new way. Instead of viewing work as a hindrance, it proposes perceiving it as an integral component of the opportunity.This quote is often used in classrooms, offices, and talks about how to grow as a person. Teachers use it to show how important it is to be consistent. Employers share it to show that hard work pays off in the long run. People think about it when they are deciding whether or not to take on tasks that need a lot of patience.Edison's words still ring true because they describe a reality that many people know. At first, opportunities may not seem appealing, but those who are willing to put in the work often reap the benefits in the end.","Thomas alva edison was born in 1847 in the us.

Big relief for EPFO members! Subscribers can now withdraw PF via UPI; rollout expected by April,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/big-relief-for-epfo-members-subscribers-can-now-withdraw-pf-via-upi-rollout-expected-by-april/articleshow/126611464.cms,"Representative image (AI-generated)

Employees’ Provident Fund Organisation (EPFO) subscribers will soon be able to withdraw their provident fund savings directly into their bank accounts using the Unified Payments Interface (UPI). The system is expected to be operational by April 2026.The move is aimed at simplifying access to funds and reducing delays in withdrawals for the country’s eight crore EPFO members.Currently, EPF members must file withdrawal claims, a process that can be time-consuming. Under the new system, a portion of the EPF will be frozen as a minimum balance, while the rest can be transferred directly to members’ bank accounts using their linked UPI PIN for secure transactions. Once credited, the funds can be used for payments or ATM withdrawals, according to news agency PTI.According to the agency, EPFO is working to resolve software glitches to ensure smooth implementation.“This system will benefit around eight crore members,” the official familiar with the matter said. Under the auto-settlement mode, withdrawal claims are electronically settled without manual intervention within three days.The claim limit for auto-settlement has already been increased from Rs 1 lakh to Rs 5 lakh, enabling members to access funds quickly for illness, education, marriage, and housing purposes.EPFO first introduced online auto-settlement of advance claims during the Covid-19 pandemic to provide timely assistance. However, all members had to file claims to access their own funds. The new system will eliminate this step, easing the burden on the EPFO, which processes over five crore claims annually.The source clarified that EPFO cannot allow unrestricted direct withdrawals as it does not hold banking licences, but the government aims to make EPFO services at par with banks.In October 2025, the EPFO’s apex decision-making body, the Central Board of Trustees (CBT), approved simplification and liberalisation of partial withdrawal provisions. Union labour minister Mansukh Mandaviya has since approved the minutes of the meeting, which will be formally notified shortly.Under the revised provisions, partial withdrawals have been streamlined from 13 complex rules into three categories: Essential Needs (illness, education, marriage), Housing Needs and Special Circumstances.Members can now withdraw up to 100 percent of their eligible balance, including both employee and employer contributions, while maintaining 25 per cent as a minimum balance to continue earning interest at the current 8.25 per cent per annum.This rationalisation ensures members can access funds easily while preserving a substantial retirement corpus. With simplified procedures, zero documentation and 100 percent auto-settlement for eligible withdrawals, the new system is expected to significantly enhance the ease of living for EPF members.",Epfo subscribers will soon be able to withdraw their provident fund savings directly into their bank accounts using the unified payments interface.

From Olympic gold to global business icon, Anthony Joshua's financial journey



Anthony Joshua has turned his boxing success into a legacy. From Olympic hero to global superstar, his rise over the past decade has been steady and powerful. Now, the British star is not only known for knockouts. He is also known for smart contracts, big-brand deals, and careful business moves. His net worth growth reflects consistency at the top level of sport.As of now, Anthony Joshua’s estimated net worth stands at around $150 million (per celebrity net worth). Some reports suggest it could rise closer to $200 million after his recent mega fights. His paycheques come from huge fight purses, global endorsements, and business investments. Joshua is now one of the richest boxers in the world.Anthony Joshua’s big payday journey began after his gold medal win at the 2012 London Olympics. By 2016, his professional career was booming. He won world titles and quickly became a box office star. His early title fights earned him millions and pushed his net worth into the tens of millions.The defining moment came in April 2017. Joshua defeated Wladimir Klitschko at Wembley Stadium.The fight made him a global name. It also delivered one of his first massive paydays. From that point, Joshua became a stadium fighter who could sell out any venue.Between 2017 and 2018, Joshua defended his titles against Carlos Takam, Joseph Parker, and Alexander Povetkin. Each fight brought eight-figure earnings. Sponsors followed. Brands like Under Armour, Beats by Dre, and Hugo Boss signed major deals with him. His clean image and athletic build made him highly marketable.In 2019, Joshua reached a financial peak. Although he lost to Andy Ruiz Jr. in June, the rematch later that year changed everything. He earned a reported $57.5 million in Saudi Arabia. This became the biggest payday of his career at the time. His net worth jumped sharply after that fight.Anthony Joshua faced setbacks in 2021 and 2022 with losses to Oleksandr Usyk. Still, the money kept flowing. His second fight against Usyk alone earned him over $40 million. Even in defeat, Joshua remained one of boxing’s highest-paid stars.From 2023 onward, Anthony Joshua rebuilt both his career and brand. Wins over Jermaine Franklin and Robert Helenius kept him active. In March 2024, he knocked out Francis Ngannou and earned around $50 million. This single fight added significantly to his wealth.By late 2025, reports claimed Joshua had earned over $195 million in total career income.

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang to engineers: I want you to stop coding and start...,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/nvidia-ceo-jensen-huang-to-engineers-i-want-you-to-stop-coding-and-start-/articleshow/126543905.cms,"Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang aims for engineers to code zero percent, leveraging AI assistants like Cursor to tackle complex, undiscovered problems. He believes this 'Purpose vs Task' approach, akin to radiology's evolution, will elevate human roles. While some, like Cursor's CEO, caution against unchecked AI development, Huang remains confident in this human-centric future for innovation.

Why radiologists didn't disappear, and why engineers might not either

Vibe coding pioneers warn Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang ’s approach has limits





Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang wants his engineers to spend exactly zero percent of their time writing code. In a recent appearance on the No Priors AI podcast, Huang revealed that every engineer at the $3 trillion chipmaker now uses Cursor, an AI coding assistant, throughout their workday. His goal? Free them entirely from what he calls 'syntax' so they can focus on finding and solving problems that haven't been cracked yet.""Nothing would give me more joy than if none of our engineers were coding at all,"" Huang said. ""And they were just purely solving undiscovered problems.""This isn't just philosophical musing. Huang has been pushing a framework he calls 'Purpose vs Task' across multiple interviews in recent months, including a viral appearance on The Joe Rogan Experience. The idea is simple: coding is the task, but discovering and solving novel problems is the purpose. AI should handle the former so humans can concentrate on the latter.Huang points to radiology as proof this approach creates jobs rather than eliminates them. Years ago, AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton predicted radiologists would be obsolete within five years because computers could scan images faster than humans. Instead, radiologist numbers have grown.The reason, Huang argues, is that reading scans was always just a task—the real purpose is diagnosing disease and improving patient outcomes. When AI took over the grunt work, demand for the human expertise behind it actually expanded.At Nvidia's recent all-hands meeting, Huang reportedly pushed back hard against managers who were telling teams to dial back AI usage. ""Are you insane?"" he said, according to Business Insider. He promised employees they'd still have work to do—just more ambitious work, the report said.The push comes at a pivotal moment for software engineering. Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently revealed that AI now writes over 30% of new code at the company, while Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei claimed Claude generates 90% of his firm's code. Yet a METR study from July found AI assistants actually decreased experienced developers' productivity by 19%—even though participants expected a 20% boost. The gap between hype and reality suggests Huang's vision of code-free engineers may be further out than his enthusiasm implies.Not everyone shares Huang's unbridled optimism. Michael Truell, CEO of Cursor itself—the $29 billion startup whose AI tool Nvidia has embraced—recently cautioned against 'vibe coding,' where developers let AI build software without reviewing the output. ""If you close your eyes and don't look at the code and have AIs build things with shaky foundations, things start to kind of crumble,"" Truell told Fortune's Brainstorm AI conference.Even Andrej Karpathy, the former Tesla AI director who coined the term 'vibe coding,' admitted his recent Nanochat project was ""basically entirely hand-written"" because AI agents ""just didn't work well enough."" He recently warned fellow programmers: ""I've never felt this much behind. The profession is being dramatically refactored.""For now, the Nvidia CEO is betting big that humans who focus on purpose rather than tasks will come out ahead. Whether that bet pays off for the millions of developers who actually write code for a living remains the undiscovered problem.","Jensen huang, ceo of $3 trillion chipmaker nvidia, wants engineers to spend zero percent of their time writing code.

Merge Labs vs Neuralink





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has announced an investment in Merge Labs, a brain-computer interface (BCI) startup which was founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Rival to Elon Musk ’s Neuralink, the mission of Merge Labs is to develop safe and scaleable brain-computer interfaces. “We are excited to support and collaborate with Merge Labs as they turn an ambitious idea into reality and ultimately products that are useful for people,” said the company.OpenAI revealed that funding made by the company will support Merge Labs’ mission of creating safe, scalable brain-computer interfaces that could one day allow humans to interact with artificial intelligence directly through neural signals. The company has not yet disclosed the size of the investment, but the partnership underscores OpenAI’s growing interest in technologies that extend beyond software into hardware and human augmentation.Merge Labs is a research lab with the long-term mission of bridging biological and artificial intelligence to maximize human ability, agency, and experience. It is developing fundamentally new approaches⁠ (opens in a new window) to BCIs that are safe and interface with the brain at much higher bandwidth by combining biology, devices, and AI.The company is focused on creating non-invasive neural interfaces that can translate brain activity into digital commands. Unlike more invasive approaches that require surgical implants, Merge Labs aims to build consumer-ready devices that are both accessible and ethically designed.The company’s early prototypes reportedly use advanced sensors and machine learning models to interpret neural signals, with potential applications ranging from medical rehabilitation to enhanced productivity tools.Elon Musk founded Neuralink in 2016 and till now the company has made significant progress in developing brain implants which enable people with paralysis to control devices with the help of their thoughts. The Elon Musk-owned company recently raised $600 million at a $9 billion valuation and is conducting human trials.Merge Labs on the other hand, is reportedly working on less invasive brain interfaces with a strong emphasis on AI-powered enhancements. The focus of the startup is not just medical rehabilitation but broader human-AI integration.“I believe the merge has already started,” Altman wrote in a 2017 blog post. “We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants”.","Merge labs is a brain-computer interface (bci) startup founded by openai ceo sam altman.

MrBeast: “I actually have negative money”



Focus on reinvesting, not personal savings



High-cost decisions driven by time constraints

Multiple ventures under the MrBeast brand







Jimmy Donaldson, widely known as MrBeast, is one of the most well-known people on YouTube. He runs a business and content empire that reaches hundreds of millions of people around the world, and he's only 27. His videos often have big challenges, giving back, and record-breaking prize money. People often think that MrBeast is personally wealthy in the traditional sense, with lots of money on hand, because of how he looks to the public. But a recent interview has brought a different side of his financial situation to light. Donaldson was honest about money and said that even though the company he started is worth billions, his own bank account tells a very different story. He said he has ""negative money"" and is currently borrowing money, even for big life events. His comments have brought attention to the differences between startup valuations, equity ownership, and personal liquidity, especially for founders who keep putting money into growth. The conversation gives us a better idea of how digital businesses work today and how money is often tied up on paper instead of cash.Beast Industries, MrBeast's main business, is at the heart of what he does.As per a report from Fortune in September 2025, the company is now worth $5 billion. Donaldson owns a little more than half of the company, which gives him a big stake in it. Beast Industries runs a number of businesses, such as making big YouTube videos, creating branded content, and making consumer goods. The value takes into account the company's reach, potential for revenue, and high levels of audience engagement across platforms.But the value of a company is not the same as the cash it has on hand. A valuation is what investors think the business is worth based on how much money it will make and how fast it will grow in the future. It is not the amount of money the founder has to spend every day.Forbes said that MrBeast's net worth was $85 million in June 2025. This number includes the worth of his stake in Beast Industries and other things he owns. Donaldson has made it clear that most of this net worth is in stocks and not cash.He talked about common ideas about his wealth in an interview with The Wall Street Journal. He said that a lot of people think he is a billionaire, but that is because they mix up his net worth with his available cash. He said that it is not easy to use equity in a company for everyday expenses unless it is sold or converted, which he has decided not to do.Donaldson said something very interesting about his finances during the interview. He said, ""I really... I have negative money right now."" I am borrowing money. He also said that if you take away the equity value of his company, many viewers would technically have more money in their bank accounts than he does.He gave a simple example to explain the situation, saying that company equity can't be used to buy a McDonald’s meal in the morning. This comment made it clear that there is a difference between wealth on paper and money you can actually spend.Donaldson said that his focus on work and growth affects how he handles his money. He said he doesn't think about his bank balance very often. Instead, he is focused on making videos and growing his businesses.He has said many times that a lot of the money he makes goes back into making more content. He says that spending on making content alone is expected to reach about $250 million in one year. This model of reinvesting in productions allows for more complicated works, bigger prizes, and higher production standards, which are now a defining feature of his brand.Donaldson has made some expensive spending choices when he needed to, even though he keeps a small personal account. He told one story about how he rented a private jet to see his fiancée, Thea Booysen, who was studying in the UK at the time.He said that because of where he lived and when he worked, commercial travel took a lot of time. It took a long drive and a lot of layovers to get to a big airport. Donaldson says that a private jet cut down on travel time a lot, which meant he could keep working without losing almost a whole day to travel. The flight is said to have cost about $150,000.Donaldson told people on social media in June 2025 that he had borrowed money from his mother to help pay for his wedding. He said that this happened because he put most of his money back into his businesses.He also pointed out how ironic it was that he owned companies worth billions of dollars but still needed short-term personal loans. He said again that even though the businesses look very valuable on paper, that value doesn't always turn into cash that you can use for yourself.Donaldson's business portfolio includes several big projects, not just YouTube videos. One of them is ""Beast Games,"" a competition series that gave its first-season winner $10 million, which is one of the biggest single prizes in entertainment history. Feastables is another important business. It's a consumer brand that focuses on chocolate and snack foods, and it has grown quickly in retail markets.All of these projects need a lot of money up front. Donaldson's strategy of reinvesting rather than taking personal income is supported by high operating costs, which come from prize money, production costs, staffing, and logistics.","Jimmy donaldson, widely known as mrbeast, is one of the most well-known people on youtube.

Elon Musk warns, ‘Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will …’





Grok the AI chatbot of Elon Musk’s artificial intelligence firm xAI will no longer be able to generate sexualised or revealing images of real people. The company took this decision after the mounting criticism and regulatory scrutiny. In a post blog post share on social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), the company company confirmed that it has implemented technological measures in to order to prevent Grok account from allowing the editing of images of real people. This move of the company comes after Grok users were exploiting the tool to create AI deepfakes of women and minors, undressing them in manipulated images.California Attorney General Rob Bonta revealed he had launched an investigation into Grok’s role in producing sexualized deepfakes, citing a flood of complaints in recent weeks. Meanwhile, Indonesia and Malaysia suspended Grok entirely, becoming the first countries to ban the tool. Lawmakers in the UK have also publicly considered a suspension.In a statement posted on X’s safety account the company wrote:Recently, Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s AI chatbot Grok, integrated into his social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter), has now announced that its image generation and editing tools will now be restricted to paying subscribers. Image generation and editing are currently limited to paying subscribers. You can subscribe to unlock these features,” Grok posted late January 8, linking to X’s premium membership page.Elon Musk said that anyone using AI chatbot Grok to make illegal content on his platform X (formerly known as Twitter) will be punished. Musk’s comments came after the chatbot – hardwired into X came under fire for producing obscene/ non-consensual images, including women and children. In an online post, the tech billionaire wrote “Anyone using Grok to make illegal content will suffer the same consequences as if they upload illegal content”. The Tesla CEO was responding to a post on “inappropriate images” generated by grok.DogeDesigner, followed by Elon Musk wrote in the post: “Some people are saying Grok is creating inappropriate images.

Wang's inexperience becomes liability for Mark Zuckerberg as AI race intensifies

Meta reorganizes infrastructure chain of command above Wang





Meta's newest reporting structure is exposing something leadership has tried to hide—friction between CEO Mark Zuckerberg and his highest-paid employee, Alexandr Wang. Multiple sources close to the company reveal that Wang, the 28-year-old founder Zuckerberg recruited for $14 billion, finds the CEO's hands-on management suffocating. At the same time, current staff question whether Wang has the chops to lead Meta's $600 billion AI bet.The tension surfaced this fall during a crucial meeting. Wang's TBD Lab team and longtime executives Chris Cox and Andrew Bosworth clashed over strategy. Cox and Bosworth wanted Wang's new AI model trained on Instagram and Facebook data to boost the company's core advertising business. Wang pushed back hard. He argued the goal should be catching up to OpenAI and Google's models first, worrying that customizing training for product tasks would slow progress.It's an us-versus-them mentality that's become impossible to ignore inside Meta. Wang's researchers view the old guard as mere product managers stuck in the social media era. They're chasing superintelligence while everyone else cares about feeds and ads. Some staff even questioned whether $2 billion was quietly shifted from Bosworth's Reality Labs budget to Wang's team—though Meta's spokesperson denied the figure, the whispers persist.The cracks widened when Yann LeCun, Meta's legendary AI scientist and a Turing Award winner, bolted in November rather than report to Wang. Sources say LeCun bristled at serving under someone whose background was data labeling, not cutting-edge AI research. Before that, Nat Friedman, another big hire, faced pressure to move faster. The rushed launch of Vibes, Meta's AI video feed, frustrated his team who felt forced to compete with OpenAI's Sora before they were ready.Wang told associates that Zuckerberg's micromanagement feels suffocating. Yet here's the irony—Zuckerberg hired him specifically because he needed someone he could control, someone young and ambitious enough to execute his vision of ""personal superintelligence."" The CEO's reputation for obsessing over chosen projects means TBD Lab gets his undivided attention. That laser focus looks less like support and more like surveillance, the report said.This week, Zuckerberg announced Meta Compute, a new top-level initiative reporting directly to him. He's putting Santosh Janardhan and Daniel Gross in charge, with Dina Powell McCormick handling government relations. The move effectively centralizes infrastructure decisions above Wang, suggesting Zuckerberg wants tighter control as Meta burns through billions. If Wang thought he had autonomy, this announcement proved otherwise. The company's trajectory suggests Zuckerberg's betting everything on AI—and he's not delegating that to a 28-year-old anymore.The restructuring carries real risks. Wang's TBD Lab only lost two researchers during their first vesting period in November, suggesting the team still has some loyalty. But the organizational shuffle sends a message that nobody—not even the $14 billion hire—operates without Zuckerberg's constant oversight. Scale AI, the startup Zuckerberg invested in to poach Wang, is already losing credibility in the market. Private investors have slashed its valuation from $29 billion to as low as $7.3 billion. If Wang's leadership at Meta falters, it raises uncomfortable questions: did Zuckerberg overpay for the wrong person, or is he simply incapable of trusting anyone with real power?","Alexandr wang, meta's highest-paid employee, finds mark zuckerberg's hands-on management suffocating.

Hack of the day: Get compensation for failed UPI payments,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/hack-of-day/hack-of-the-day-get-compensation-for-failed-upi-payments/articleshow/126666744.cms,"The Times of India' brings you 'Hack of the Day'—a new weekday series of quick, practical solutions to everyday hassles. Each hack is designed to save you time, money or stress, using tools and features within your reach—from government websites to everyday apps.

In simple words it is: Simple fixes for smarter living.

What this solves



Steps to claim compensation



Transaction fails → Wait for T+1 day (transaction day + one business day). No refund? → Raise a dispute in your UPI app (Google Pay, PhonePe, Paytm, etc.). Still unresolved? → File a complaint on the RBI CMS portal: cms.rbi.org.in(cms.rbi.org.in in Bing). Mention the delay → Banks are mandated to pay ₹100 per day beyond the turnaround time (TAT).

This applies only to failed transactions where money was debited but not received by the beneficiary.

It does not apply to successful transfers sent to the wrong person.





Digital payments have made life easier, but sometimes UPI transactions fail — leaving you stuck with the dreaded “money deducted but not received” message. What many users don’t know is that you are legally entitled to compensation if banks or apps delay refunds beyond the prescribed time.This hack ensures that banks and apps don’t sit on your money after a failed UPI transaction. If your money isn’t refunded promptly, you can claim daily compensation until it is. According to RBI guidelines, if a failed UPI transaction isn’t reversed within T+1 day (transaction day + 1 business day), the bank must pay you ₹100 per day of delay until the refund is processed.","This hack ensures that banks and apps don’t sit on your money after a failed upi transaction.

Life away from the spotlight often reveals the most relatable moments, and that is exactly what Livvy Dunne shared with her followers this week. The social media star and longtime girlfriend of Paul Skenes posted a set of relaxed, feel good photos on Instagram, captioned simply, “Jup life. ” The post instantly struck a chord, not because of glamour or grandeur, but because of its warmth and simplicity.At a time when curated perfection dominates social feeds, Dunne’s update felt refreshingly real. It offered a quiet look at everyday moments, capturing comfort, companionship, and a slower rhythm of life that many fans found easy to connect with.One of the images shows Dunne outdoors, smiling as she crouches beside a fluffy white dog. Barefoot and relaxed, she appears completely at ease, enjoying the moment rather than posing for it. The soft natural setting and her easy expression give the photo a peaceful tone that stands out on a platform often driven by spectacle. It feels less like a post meant to impress and more like one meant to share.The other photo shifts the center of focus to the inside where Dunne is observed with Skenes in a warm kitchen environment.Standing next to a prepared dish on the counter, the couple looks comfortable and unguarded, sharing a simple moment at home. Skenes, who pitches for the Pittsburgh Pirates, appears relaxed, while Dunne’s bright smile adds to the sense of ease and familiarity.The post was very impactful because it was so subdued. It did not have a long title or description, and only two words, suggesting where to go and how to live. For fans used to seeing both Dunne and Skenes in high pressure environments, these images offered a reminder that behind the headlines and performances, there is comfort in ordinary moments.In sharing this glimpse, Dunne enabled followers to see a softer side of her life, one based on routine and companionship and tranquility. It was a little post that made a massive emotional impression proving that sometimes the quietest updates speak the loudest.","Livvy dunne posted a set of relaxed, feel good photos on instagram.
