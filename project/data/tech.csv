Astronomer CEO BEGS For ‘TRUST’ Amid ‘Surreal’ Fallout After ColdplayGate | Byron-Cabot Scandal

Poll Do you think leadership changes help companies overcome controversies? Yes No

Astronomer's reputation takes a hit







Pete Dejoy, the interim CEO of Astronomer, did not bury his head on the scandal as he took charge of his new role and instead put out a statement on LinkedIn. Dejoy said the media attention to their startup because of the viral video has been unusual and surreal. Astronomer is now a household name, he said adding that he would never wish for it to happen like this.""At Astronomer we have never shied away from challenges; a near-decade of building this business has tested us time and time again, and each time we’ve emerged stronger. From starting a software company in Cincinnati, Ohio, to keeping the lights on through the collapse of the bank that held all our cash, to scaling from 30 to 300 people during a global pandemic that demanded we do it all without ever being in the same room,"" he wrote.""The events of the past few days have received a level of media attention that few companies—let alone startups in our small corner of the data and AI world—ever encounter. The spotlight has been unusual and surreal for our team and, while I would never have wished for it to happen like this, Astronomer is now a household name,"" his statement read.""I’m stepping into this role with a wholehearted commitment to taking care of our people and delivering for our customers.Astronomer’s foundation remains strong, built around the thriving Apache Airflow community. Our opportunity to build a DataOps platform for the age of AI remains massive. And our story is very much still being written,"" Dejoy said.After the video went viral, the work culture of Astronomer started being questioned as many people suggested that another person from the office, who was aware about the affair, was present. Though the company issued a statement denying the presence of any other person apart from the former CEO and the HR chief, many former employees spoke out anonymously about the toxic work culture of the startup.While Andy Byron resigned amid the controversy, Astronomer's silence over Kristin Cabot, the HR head who was there with Andy, has been questioned. The company did not mention her in any of its statements so far.Following the embarrassing incident, Megan Kerrigan, wife of Andy Byron, had removed the 'Byron' surname from her Facebook profile before deleting it.","Pete dejoy, the interim ceo of astronomer, did not bury his head on the scandal as he took charge of his new role and instead put out a statement on linkedin.

NEW DELHI: The government on Friday banned 25 over-the-top (OTT) platforms for hosting 'indecent content'. It also directed internet service providers to disable public access to these websites, according to sources cited by news agency ANI.The action was taken in consultation with the MHA, MWCD, MeitY, Department of Legal Affairs, industry bodies FICCI and CII, as well as experts in women’s and child rights, the report said.The move aims to restrict the easy access to pornographic content, especially by minors, and to ensure that digital content adheres to legal and moral standards, they added.According to PTI sources, the following apps were identified for violating various laws:The current bans comes after a similar order last year when the I&B ministry cracked down on 18 over-the-top (OTT) streaming platforms for circulating obscene, vulgar and in some cases pornographic content. The move, taken in coordination with intermediaries, also included blocking 19 associated websites, 10 mobile apps, and 57 social media accounts linked to these platforms.BJP MP Anurag Singh Thakur had warned platforms against promoting obscenity under the cover of creativity. Acting under the Information Technology Act, 2000, the ministry consulted experts from media, women’s rights, and child protection before initiating the ban.The platforms blocked include Dreams Films, Voovi, Yessma, Hunters, Rabbit, and Prime Play, among others.The government had then found that much of the content depicted women in degrading ways, included nudity and sexual acts in inappropriate contexts—such as teacher-student and incestuous relationships—and lacked any social or narrative value. These were deemed to be in violation of Section 67 and 67A of the IT Act, Section 292 of the Indian Penal Code, and the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986.Some of the blocked apps had seen massive traction, with one crossing over one crore downloads and others exceeding 50 lakh on the Google Play Store. Social media was used extensively by these platforms to push clips, trailers, and links, collectively amassing over 3.2 million followers.","The government on friday banned 25 over-the-top (ott) platforms for hosting 'indecent content' it also directed internet service providers to disable public access to these websites.

Centre suggests 'country of origin' filter on e-commerce sites,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/centre-suggests-country-of-origin-filter-on-e-commerce-sites/articleshow/122913751.cms,"Centre suggests 'country of origin' filter on e-commerce sites

New Delhi/Mumbai: Consumer affairs department on Friday suggested e-commerce companies explore including a new filter feature of ""country of origin"" on their websites and mobile apps for products, which will help consumers make quick choices. E-commerce platforms would have to create a new filter having a drop down menu of countries, allowing consumers to make their choice as per their preference.At present, companies display the country of origin of items under the product description option and to check this, buyers need to go through the entire information of each product, which is more time taking. ""Many of the e-commerce platforms have filters on their sites and apps such as price range, brand, type of product and different sizes. So, adding another filter on country of origin is very much feasible and that will help consumers to find items of their choice based on their country of origin quickly. This will bring customer satisfaction,"" said an official.The department held a video conference with industry players and other stakeholders on Friday for amending the Legal Metrology (Packaged Commodities) Rules for country of origin-based filters on their platforms.""There was almost a consensus among the participants, including from major ecommerce firms, and they said this would need change in the algorithm to create this new filter feature. We will hold more deliberations with the stakeholders,"" said an official. Sources said earlier the e-commerce firms smoothly complied with the Legal Metrology Rules for labeling packaged commodities.Industry sources said the meeting was more of an exploratory one where the idea was to understand the feasibility of getting the added filter within apps and platforms. They added that officials wanted to understand the constraints of companies if they were to create such a feature. ""For marketplaces like Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra, it would be more of a tech related issue, which can be solved. But for companies which hold inventory, there may be an added compliance burden,"" one of them said.Another e-commerce executive, however, said that given the limited space on mobile phones, adding another filter could be a constraint. ""It could be quite draining for the industry. And the expectation of the ministry is to get it done before the festive season if it gets implemented,"" he said.Satish Meena, adviser at market research firm Datum Intelligence, said if this is implemented, customers will be able to filter out products based on their country of origin which means that some brands on these platforms could lose visibility. ""Until now, not many consumers paid so much attention to a product's country of origin. But overall, it shouldn't be a very big challenge for platforms,"" he added. For quick commerce platforms, food and grocery accounts for a major part of their coverage as of now and most of them are sourced from India anyway. A very small part of their inventory comes from out of India currently, added Meena.","Centre suggests 'country of origin' filter on e-commerce sites and apps.

ED searches 35 premises linked to Anil Ambani,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ed-searches-35-premises-linked-to-anil-ambani/articleshow/122891578.cms,"Ambani investigation throws up mysterious entity: 'C Company'

NEW DELHI: Early on Thursday, the ED swooped in on more than 35 premises identified with industrialist Anil Ambani and at least 50 entities associated with his Reliance Anil Dhirubhai Ambani Group (ADAG) across Mumbai in a larger money laundering investigation targeted at him based on multiple FIRs registered by CBI and other agencies over the last few years. The searches have huge financial implications for public money, Rs 20-30,000 crore, which the agency believes has been siphoned off.The searches at premises identified with industrialist Anil Ambani have huge financial implications for public money, Rs 20-30,000 crore, which the agency believes has been siphoned off, including outside the country, through ""undisclosed foreign bank accounts and foreign assets"" created over the years. A large chunk of the money came to Reliance ADAG from SBI and other public sector banks, besides Yes Bank, then a private entity, and mutual funds.Preliminary investigation has thrown up a mysterious entity: 'C Company'. The entity, whose existence was not known so far, is allegedly found to have been involved in related party transactions in this whole scam, sources said.Sources said ED was probing an alleged loan fraud ofRs 14,000 crore involving Reliance Communications Ltd and other associated entities. In response to a question in Lok Sabha on Monday, minister of state for finance Pankaj Chaudhary said SBI has ""classified Reliance Communications Ltd along with promoter director Anil Ambani as 'fraud' on June 13"".This has also been communicated to Bombay Stock Exchange.""Based on information received from Sebi, ED has found Reliance Infra has diverted large sums of money disguised as ICDs to group companies of ADAG (Anil Ambani group) through 'C Company', an undisclosed related company,"" a source told TOI.Reliance Infra did not disclose 'C Company' as its related party in order to avoid having to take proper approval from shareholder and audit committees, the source added. It was also hidden presumably to circumvent checks and balances imposed on related party transactions as per laws.Besides, there is an investigation in the alleged diversion of loans of over Rs 10,000 crore by Reliance Infra. ED's probe is looking at why Reliance Infra took a haircut of Rs 5,480 crore, receiving only Rs 4 crore in cash, while agreeing to settle the remaining Rs 6,499 crore through transfer to certain discoms, which have neither been operational nor done business for many years.The agency is already probing Ambani and his entities in a case of Rs 3,000 crore received from Yes Bank where he is alleged to have bribed the former CEO of the bank, Rana Kapoor, through his wife's company for Rs 225 crore. In another case of alleged misappropriation of bank funds, the agency is probing Reliance Communications for a loan default ofRs 1,050 crore to Canara Bank.Sources said more than 25 individuals, including Ambani and his close associates, are targets of the search operations which started on Thursday morning in a probe initiated under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.ED is being assisted by multiple agencies, including National Housing Bank, Sebi, National Financial Reporting Authority and Bank of Baroda among others.The alleged loan diversion of around Rs 3,000 crore from Yes Bank pertains to the period between 2017 and 2019. ED is investigating alleged quid pro quo in sanction of loan as a Reliance Anil Ambani entity had transferredRs 225 crore into the accounts of RAB Enterprises, in which Rana Kapoor's wife Bindu Kapoor had 100% stake.These are all part of an FIR registered by CBI and now being investigated by ED. The FIR also alleged that credit approval memorandums were back dated, and the proposed investments lacked due diligence, not meeting the bank's credit policy.Sources said preliminary investigation found that these loans were diverted to many group entities and shell companies, in many cases there was no proper documentation to loans issued. In several cases, borrowers were found to have common addresses and directors.","The ed swooped in on more than 35 premises identified with industrialist anil ambani and at least 50 entities associated with his reliance anil dhirubhai ambani group.

Maddison Hill lays out her “Brady is Kim’s type” theory



“I do think Tom Brady is somebody who Kim Kardashian would like, just because he is good‑looking, he is successful, he is motivated, he is in the right circles, he is well‑connected.”

Kim Kardashian BITTER over Tom Brady REJECTION? Hailey Bieber comments on CRAZY life w/ Justin +MORE

No, they’re not together and that’s the point



Why fans are eating this up anyway



FAQs:

1. Who is Maddison Hill?

2. Did Maddison Hill say Tom Brady and Kim Kardashian are dating?

3. Has Tom Brady commented on Kim Kardashian?

Before the dating rumors start swirling again, let’s clear the air, Tom Brady and Kim Kardashian are not dating. But that hasn’t stopped entertainment host Maddison Hill from playing a little matchmaker in the public sphere. In her recent YouTube video , Hill explained why she thinks the former NFL superstar and reality TV queen would actually make the perfect couple, if it ever happened.Maddison Hill, known for her YouTube and social media commentary on celebrity life, recently gave her take on one of Hollywood’s most talked-about hypotheticals: What if Tom Brady and Kim Kardashian ever dated?Hill’s thoughts came during her recent YouTube video, where she explained:In other words, Tom checks all the boxes. Looks? Check. Fame? Big check. Elite connections? Yup. Ambition? Obviously.Here’s what makes Hill’s commentary ethical and fun, it’s just that: commentary. There’s no claim of insider info, no “source says they’re texting,” and zero paparazzi pics to overanalyze. Hill is offering a hypothetical, much like how fans pair off celebs in imaginary rom-com scenarios.While Kim and Tom were loosely linked in tabloids last year mainly after being spotted at the same event, they’ve never confirmed anything romantic.In fact, Brady was more recently linked to Sofía Vergara, which some fans speculated may have caused a bit of side-eye from Kim’s camp. But again, pure speculation, never addressed by either party.It’s not hard to see why the idea of Kim K and Tom Brady as a power couple keeps popping up in pop culture circles. They’re both massively successful, good-looking, and iconic in their respective worlds. Add Maddison Hill’s playful commentary into the mix, and the internet has another “what if” pairing to swoon or roll their eyes over.But let’s be clear: this isn’t a rumor, it’s just a vibe.Maddison Hill gave fans something to laugh and think about with her take, but it’s not confirmation of anything brewing between Kim and Tom. It's simply what it is, a media personality giving her read on what could work, not what is happening.So until we see them holding hands courtside (unlikely), take this one as a fun bit of celeb matchmaking, not TMZ breaking news.Maddison Hill is an entertainment host and commentator known for her YouTube and social media presence where she covers celebrity culture and Hollywood gossip.No. Maddison Hill gave her opinion on why Tom Brady would be a good match for Kim Kardashian, but she did not claim they are dating.No, Tom Brady has never publicly commented on any romantic link to Kim Kardashian.Also read - “Disgusting behavior”: Ja’Marr Chase’s viral hand placement on his girlfriend has fans spiraling and screaming","Maddison hill is an entertainment host and commentator known for her youtube and social media presence.

The Incognito Dolphin cosmetic bundle for Jeff the Land Shark first made its way into Marvel Rivals in December 2024 in Season 0 of the game. This Epic skin became an instant hit after its release and the discounted price of 1,400 lattice added fuel to the anticipation.However, many players started playing the game after Season 0, so most of them missed out on this adorable outfit and the other cosmetics within the bundle. That is why, this highly wanted bundle is back again for players to collect, but there is a catch.Marvel Rivals has recently launched the Incognito Dolphin cosmetic bundle for Jeff the Land Shark yet again, and the most exciting part about it is that fans can get this bundle for absolutely free. But the catch is that only the PlayStation users having an active PS Plus subscription can get this for free.The Incognito Dolphin bundle comes with a costume for Jeff the Land Shark along with an MVP animation, a Spray, a Nameplate, and 300 Chrono Tokens. Now the question is, how can PS Plus members redeem this bundle? This process is quite simple. All they have to do is to make sure that their PlayStation account is connected to Marvel Rivals.And then they need to head on to the PlayStation Store and search for the “Marvel Rivals - 2025 Q3 bundle” from their PS5 console itself or through the online store.After opening that page, players need to hit the “Add to Cart” option, and at last continue with the “Confirm Purchase” option. As long as an active PS Plus account is connected to the store, the price of this bundle will be shown as $0.00. So, it will be an absolutely free bundle for the PS Plus users. After completing the purchase, the bundle will automatically reflect in the associated Marvel Rivals account in the game.As of now, there is no expiration date of this bundle mentioned in the PlayStation Store. But players should make this transaction as early as possible, because this free deal might be replaced by the Q4 bundle in near future.Non-PS Plus members shouldn’t get disappointed because they can also get another freebie, irrespective of any PS Plus subscription, in the form of the Scarlet Spider costume for Spider-Man, which they can redeem by following the same aforementioned process. However, the PlayStation account needs to be connected with Marvel Rivals as it’s a PS-exclusive skin.However, players from different platforms might get really disappointed because none of these free rewards are available in the in-game store to buy through Lattice or in-game credits.","The incognito dolphin cosmetic bundle for jeff the land shark first made its way into marvel rivals in december 2024 in season 0 of the game.

Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 is rumored to arrive on PlayStation 5

In the world of console-wars, PlayStation and Xbox are the two names that have held their grounds firm since their launches. This is one of the very few “Messi-Ronaldo” like debates that divides the world into two parts.Be it superior hardwares, or better value-for-money subscription models, both consoles always get an edge over each other. However, the major distinctive factor has to be “console exclusivity.” But that thin line is diminishing slowly, and another Xbox-exclusive title might influence this process later this year.It was 2024 when the term “console-exclusivity” slowly started to perish as major Xbox-exclusive titles like Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment, and many others made their way on to PlayStation 5. Similar efforts were put by Sony as well when popular PlayStation-exclusive titles like Helldivers 2 , Indiana Jones and the Great Circle were released on Xbox. Now, it seems another hugely popular Xbox-first party title, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, might land in the arch rival camp.With the major first-party titles getting released on rival platforms becoming a trend recently, the arrival of MFS2024 on PS5 was quite evident, and rumors were already spreading around the internet. Now, a recent claim by credible leaker NateTheHate solidifies those rumors to a greater extent.Recently, a fan on Twitter asked NateTheHate about the potential release of MFS2024 on PlayStation 5. The leaker replied back with the confirmation about the query. Not only that, he also gave a probable release window of 2025. According to him, PlayStation fans might see MFS2024 surfacing on their platform around the completion of one year of its actual release, which is on November 19, 2024.If Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 really lands on PlayStation 5, that would really open the floodgate from both sides as MFS2024 is surely one of the biggest first-party Xbox titles. This will also mark a significant turning point in the gaming industry where console companies would stop restricting their first-party titles to their platforms, and the publishing companies will look to boost their sales from different platforms. And it makes a lot of sense as well.",Microsoft flight simulator 2024 is rumored to arrive on playstation 5 later this year. Leaker natethehate also gave a probable release window of 2025.

From IAS to Microsoft to AI to classical singing, the man going viral for his lyrics and LinkedIn",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/who-is-kashish-mittal-from-ias-to-microsoft-to-ai-to-classical-singing-the-man-going-viral-for-his-lyrics-and-linkedin/articleshow/122899560.cms,"Kashish Mittal’s early achievements and civil services career

Life after IAS: Microsoft and AI

A lifelong passion for music

Kashish Mittal is what every Indian parent dreams of and what every nosy relative secretly resents. An IIT topper (AIR 6), IAS officer at 21, Microsoft techie, AI entrepreneur , and now an Indian classical singer — his career timeline reads like a Bollywood script co-written by UPSC aspirants, tech bros, and art lovers. For the middle class, he was the ultimate “shaadi biodata material” until he did the unthinkable: quit the IAS and followed his heart into music. For relatives, his CV is a nightmare, as they hide their jealousy behind forced smiles, and for many others, it’s simply unbelievable. His bold decisions have left family WhatsApp groups stunned and LinkedIn timelines inspired. Today, his soulful lyrics and viral posts are making him India’s most melodious multi-hyphenate.Mittal’s academic excellence was evident early on. After securing an AIR 6 in the JEE, he pursued electrical engineering at IIT Delhi. In 2009, he cracked the UPSC exam and joined the IAS, becoming one of the youngest officers in his batch. He held significant positions, including serving as the private secretary to the Vice Chairman of NITI Aayog. However, in 2019, Mittal made headlines by resigning from the IAS, reportedly dissatisfied with a transfer to Arunachal Pradesh. His departure from civil service sparked debates and admiration alike.Contrary to popular perception that he gave up all structured work, Mittal joined Microsoft after leaving the IAS, working in AI-driven projects. His tech journey didn’t stop there. In 2025, he co-founded an AI startup focused on human potential and ethical technology. His transition from bureaucracy to big tech and now entrepreneurship reflects his diverse interests and adaptability.Mittal had been training in Hindustani classical music since childhood. Post-IAS, he gave his full attention to music, performing professionally as a classical vocalist of the Agra Gharana. He is an empanelled artist with ICCR and All India Radio, with his compositions reflecting a blend of spiritual depth and technical rigor. His renditions have gained widespread attention online, with many calling him a rare blend of intellect and art.In addition to his performances, Mittal’s presence on social media has contributed significantly to his viral fame in 2024 and 2025. His LinkedIn posts offer a unique blend of personal reflections, career insights, and poetic musings, resonating particularly well with a generation that values authenticity and non-traditional success stories. Screenshots of his profile and posts circulate widely, sparking conversations about breaking free from societal expectations and pursuing passion alongside professional achievement.Moreover, Mittal’s Instagram reels have garnered massive engagement. A particularly viral reel features him singing Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan’s “Unke Andaz-e-Karam,” amassing nearly 3 million views. The video captures his soulful voice and classical training in a spontaneous, relatable setting, often shared with captions reflecting the emotions of love and loss. This blend of classical artistry and modern social media appeal has cemented his status as a multi-hyphenate artist capturing the imagination of India’s youth and beyond.","Kashish mittal was an iit topper (air 6), ias officer at 21, microsoft techie, ai entrepreneur, and now an indian classical singer.

Tesla CEO Elon Musk has shared a post on X (formerly Twitter), suggesting a shift in his stance toward artificial intelligence . Admitting he had been “living in denial” about the technology for too long, Elon Musk wrote in the post: “I resisted AI for too long. Living in denial. Now it is game on.” Musk was replying to a post shared by an X user Mario Nawfal that quoted Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang who called Musk a ‘superhuman’.While Elon Musk has been both a vocal critic and early investor in AI, he has previously warned about the dangers of uncontrolled AI development, once calling it humanity’s “biggest existential threat.” His latest statement suggests a more aggressive pivot from caution to action.The post comes as the tech billionaire continues to expand his presence in the AI space through xAI , the startup he launched in 2023 to compete with companies like OpenAI , Google DeepMind, and Anthropic.Elon Musk’s relationship with AI has been complex. The tech CEO co-founded ChatGPT-maker OpenAI in 2015, but later distanced himself from the company. Over the years, he has expressed concerns about AI safety, calling for regulation and greater oversight.While Elon Musk did not elaborate on what specific moves might follow his tweet, observers say the post is likely a signal to investors, rivals, and users that he intends to take a more direct role in AI development. Notably, the tech CEO tagged three of his major companies – Tesla, SpaceX and xAI in his post.Elon Musk’s “game on” remark also hints at increasing competition in the AI sector, where companies are racing to release faster, more powerful language models and build new infrastructure to support them.In a related news, Tesla India recently shared a post on X, announcing an update on the availability of Tesla cars in the country. “Now everyone in India can order directly on our website,” the post read, adding that four cities will get priority delivery. The post was later reshared by Tesla CEO Elon Musk.","Tesla ceo elon musk has shared a post on x (formerly twitter) admitting he had been “living in denial” about the technology for too long, musk wrote in the post: “i resisted ai for too many years.

The rise of physical AI and the future of robotics

During a recent visit to Beijing, Nvidia co-founder and CEO Jensen Huang was asked what he would study if he were a 20-year-old graduate in 2025. His answer was clear: he’d choose a different academic direction than the one that launched his own career. Though he didn’t explicitly name a single subject, Huang emphasized that he would lean more toward the physical sciences rather than software. This subtle but significant shift points to his evolving view of where the next wave of opportunity lies. His response reflects a broader vision for the future of artificial intelligence—one rooted not just in code, but in physics, robotics , and the mechanics of the real world that AI must increasingly learn to navigate and reason through.Jensen Huang, who earned his electrical engineering degree from Oregon State University and a master’s from Stanford, co-founded Nvidia in 1993. Today, the company sits at the forefront of the AI revolution and recently hit a historic $4 trillion market cap. While reflecting on his own path, Huang revealed he had graduated from college at age 20 and, if given the chance again, would pursue physical sciences, fields that deal with non-living systems like physics, chemistry, and astronomy.Although he didn’t go into specifics about why, Huang’s broader remarks provide insight. Over the years, AI has evolved from “Perception AI,” which focused on recognition tasks like image detection, to “Generative AI,” which includes language models capable of translating, coding, and creating. But the next chapter, according to Huang, is “Reasoning AI,” systems that can understand context, solve novel problems, and act as “agentic AI” or digital robots with reasoning power.Huang’s vision aligns with growing industry momentum around embodied AI—where intelligence is tied to physical systems like robots or autonomous machines. Leading research labs such as DeepMind and Boston Dynamics are already exploring this frontier, integrating reinforcement learning with robotics to train systems capable of real-world interaction and problem-solving. This convergence of AI with physics and motion is what Huang sees as the next great leap.Huang’s remarks hint at a future where AI is not just software-driven but deeply embedded in the physical world. This shift could redefine education paths for aspiring technologists, with physics and engineering regaining center stage. It’s no longer just about writing better code; it’s about building machines that think, move, and adapt. And for Huang, the future of AI might look less like a screen and more like a robot with a brain.Looking ahead, Huang predicts the rise of “Physical AI,” where artificial intelligence must grasp real-world physics: friction, inertia, cause and effect. These capabilities go beyond generating text or images—they involve anticipating how objects move, how to grip items with the right force, or how to infer the presence of hidden obstacles like a pedestrian behind a car.When AI gains this kind of physical reasoning and is embedded into machines, it leads to robotics, a critical component of Huang’s vision. With global labor shortages and the rapid expansion of manufacturing facilities, especially across the United States, Huang sees robotics powered by physical AI as essential. “Hopefully, in the next 10 years... they’re highly robotic and helping us deal with the severe labor shortage,” he said, underscoring the need for innovation that bridges the digital and physical worlds.","Jensen huang predicts the rise of “physical ai,” where artificial intelligence must grasp real-world physics.

AI-powered growth and record investments

From modest beginnings to Silicon Valley’s summit

After a decade at the helm of Alphabet, Sundar Pichai has officially joined the ranks of billionaires, marking a rare achievement for a non-founding tech CEO. Pichai, who took over as CEO of Google in 2015 and became Alphabet’s chief in 2019, now holds a net worth of $1.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The milestone comes after Alphabet’s market value soared by over $1 trillion since early 2023, delivering 120% returns to investors. Pichai’s rise has been defined by his leadership through multiple technological shifts, from mobile and cloud computing to AI. As Alphabet’s shares hit record highs, his decade-long stewardship has culminated in both financial success and strategic transformation.While tech billionaires are often company founders, Pichai’s entry into the billionaire club is different. He holds just 0.02% of Alphabet’s economic stake, currently valued at around $440 million. Most of his net worth comes from share sales and performance-based compensation over the past ten years. Bloomberg reports that he has sold over $650 million in stock during his tenure. If he had retained all his shares, they would now be worth more than $2.5 billion. Despite the modest stake, Pichai’s long-term vision and steady leadership have driven massive growth in Alphabet’s core businesses.August 2025 marks ten years since Pichai became CEO of Google. In that time, Alphabet has expanded rapidly, turning once-nascent divisions like YouTube, Cloud, Play, and Subscriptions into billion-dollar engines. In a recent post on X, Pichai highlighted that in 2015, Alphabet’s total revenue was $75 billion, whereas YouTube and Google Cloud alone are now generating an annual run rate of $110 billion. Under his leadership, Alphabet restructured into a parent holding company, sharpened its AI focus, and increased its global footprint.A major factor in Alphabet’s recent trillion-dollar surge has been its aggressive AI investments . The company spent $50 billion in 2023 alone on infrastructure, semiconductors, and data centers to support its AI ambitions. It also raised its 2025 capital expenditure forecast by $10 billion, reaching $85 billion, most of which is earmarked for AI infrastructure. “Our AI infrastructure investments are crucial to meeting the growth in demand for cloud customers,” Pichai said during the Q2 earnings call. Alphabet’s DeepMind acquisition in 2014 for $400 million has also paid off, helping the company stay ahead in the AI race.Born in Tamil Nadu, India, Sundar Pichai’s journey to Silicon Valley is one of resilience and brilliance. He grew up in a two-room apartment, with his first telephone arriving when he was 12. A scholarship brought him to Stanford in 1993, with a one-way plane ticket that reportedly cost more than his father’s annual salary. Pichai joined Google in 2004, led the development of Chrome, and later oversaw Android, before rising to the top job.Sundar Pichai is also known for his calm, consensus-driven leadership style, which has earned him respect in an industry often defined by bold personalities. In recent years, he has become increasingly vocal on topics like AI regulation, digital privacy, and ethical tech, positioning Alphabet as a global thought leader beyond just innovation.Outside of tech, Pichai has also ventured into sports. He is reportedly part of a group of executives that acquired a 49% stake in the London Spirit cricket team for $182 million. The team competes in The Hundred, a professional cricket league launched in the UK in 2020. While his wealth may not rival that of Alphabet founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, worth $171.2 billion and $160.4 billion respectively, Pichai's path to the billionaire club is proof that transformational leadership, even without a founding stake, can build both companies and fortunes.","Sundar pichai is now worth $1.1 billion, according to the bloomberg billionaires index.

Asset managers navigate data security challenges

BlackRock , the world's largest asset manager, has imposed new restrictions on company-issued devices for employees traveling to China, requiring staff to use temporary loaner phones and prohibiting company laptops during business trips, according to Bloomberg News and Reuters reports.The financial giant detailed the ""policy enhancement"" in an internal memo effective July 16, barring the use of BlackRock-issued iPhones, iPads, laptops, and remote access via virtual private networks while in China. Employees will also lose access to the BlackRock network during personal travel to the country, Bloomberg reported.The move reflects mounting corporate anxiety about business operations in China as geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing continue to strain international business relationships. BlackRock did not immediately respond to requests for comment from either Reuters or Bloomberg.The restrictions come after a series of high-profile incidents involving Western business executives being prevented from leaving China. Wells Fargo suspended travel to China last week after one of its senior trade financing bankers, Chenyue Mao, was blocked from departing the country in what Beijing's foreign ministry described as a criminal matter.Earlier this month, China also prevented a US Patent and Trademark Office employee from leaving during a personal visit, while a US Commerce Department worker has reportedly been unable to leave China for several months.Since China implemented stricter data security laws in 2021, global financial firms have struggled to balance operational needs with compliance requirements. Many banks and asset managers have established onshore data centers to keep Chinese information within the country, adding significant costs and complicating business management.BlackRock maintains a substantial presence in China through a wholly owned mutual fund company and a wealth management joint venture with China Construction Bank Corp. The firm's new travel policy reflects the broader challenges facing global financial institutions operating in an increasingly complex regulatory and security environment between the world's two largest economies.In related news, Amazon is shutting down its AI lab in Shanghai amid rising geopolitical tensions between the US and China. Launched in 2018, this lab contributed to over 100 academic papers and helped develop a neural network framework that generated close to $1 billion in sales, according to a scientist at the lab.",Blackrock has imposed new restrictions on company-issued devices for employees traveling to china.
