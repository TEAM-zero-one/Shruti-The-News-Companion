India-France strategic ties to get major boost with Rafale & Scorpene deals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/india-france-strategic-ties-to-get-major-boost-with-rafale-scorpene-deals/articleshow/118127294.cms,"NEW DELHI: India's expansive strategic partnership with France is set to get a further boost with two mega deals being virtually finalised for direct acquisition of 26 Rafale-Marine fighters, as well as the construction of three additional Scorpene submarines, which will collectively be worth almost Rs 1 lakh crore (Euro 10.6 billion).As PM Narendra Modi left for Paris on Monday, government sources told TOI that the Rs 63,000 crore deal for 22 single-seat Rafale-M jets and four twin-seat trainers for Navy is now with the cabinet committee for security (CCS), awaiting the final nod.The Rs 33,500 crore deal for 3 additional diesel-electric Scorpene submarines, to be constructed by Mazagon Docks (MDL) in collaboration with French Naval Group, in turn, will soon head for CCS after inter-ministerial consultations. ""CCS will take up the Rafale-M deal after the PM returns from France-US trip. The cost negotiations for Scorpenes took a little longer because MDL had originally quoted a high price. The aim is to ink both deals before this fiscal ends on March 31,"" a source said.The two countries are also discussing a possible collaboration between French major Safran, which already makes helicopter engines in India, and DRDO to co-develop the 110 kilonewton jet engine for the Indian fifth-generation stealth fighter project, AMCA (advanced medium combat aircraft). But that is in the future. The impending government-to-government Rafale-M deal includes weapons, simulators, crew training and five-year performance-based logistics support as well as spares for the 36 Rafales already inducted by IAF under the Rs 59,000 crore contract in Sept 2016.The 26 Rafale-M jets manufactured by Dassault Aviation, with ""specific enhancements"" to operate from the deck of indigenous aircraft carrier INS Vikrant, will be delivered in 37 to 65 months after inking of the contract. ""The new inter-governmental agreement mirrors the one inked in the IAF deal. All jets are to be delivered by 2030-31,"" a source said.The first of the three additional Scorpenes, in turn, will roll out of MDL in six years, followed by the other two at intervals of a year each, after the contract is inked. The deal's cost does not yet include the price of fitting them with the fuel cell-based air-independent propulsion (AIP) developed by DRDO for greater underwater endurance.The three new Scorpenes will have ""some design modifications and improvements"" over the first six such Kalvari-class vessels constructed at MDL for over Rs 23,000 crore. The plan is to fit them with the indigenous AIP, while the first six operational Scorpenes will progressively get it when they come for their scheduled refits.","The deal for 22 single-seat rafale-m jets and four twin-seat trainers for navy is now with the cabinet committee for security (ccs), awaiting the final nod.

Harry Bolz Meaning: Elon Musk changes his X (formerly Twitter) profile name to Harry Bolz: What does it mean?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/elon-musk-changes-ex-name-to-harry-bolz-what-does-it-mean/articleshow/118146142.cms,"What Does Harry Bōlz Mean?

April 2023: The ‘Harry Bōlz’ Incident

December 2024: ‘Kekius Maximus’ and Internet Subcultures

Why Does Musk Change His Name?

Humour and Entertainment – Many of Musk’s social media antics, including his name changes, seem intended to amuse both himself and his audience.

Cultural References – He frequently taps into online trends and memes, demonstrating his awareness of internet subcultures.

Disruptive Marketing – By generating discussions around his name changes, Musk keeps attention on his X profile and maintains engagement with his audience.

Elon Musk changed his X account name to Harry Bōlz on Tuesday, marking the second time he has adopted this alias. The billionaire had briefly used the same handle in April 2023. His latest stunt comes just hours after reports emerged that a Musk-led consortium of investors has placed a bid to take control of OpenAI.The 53-year-old, who heads the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), is currently making cuts across multiple federal agencies in an effort to reduce government spending.Musk likely used the name as a play on words, referencing the slang term ‘hairy balls’. While the reason behind his latest name change remains unclear, Musk previously explained the joke in a tweet back in 2023.Musk, the billionaire entrepreneur and owner of X (formerly Twitter), is well known for his unpredictable and often humorous online behaviour. Among his many quirks is a habit of changing his display name on the platform, sometimes as a joke and other times as a cryptic nod to internet culture. While Musk has altered his name multiple times, two notable instances stand out—his brief use of “Harry Bōlz” in April 2023 and “Kekius Maximus” in December 2024.In April 2023, Musk changed his display name on X to ""Harry Bōlz."" At the time, the reasoning behind this move was not immediately clear. However, it was widely interpreted as a joke, playing on the phonetic similarity to “hairy balls,” a slang term often used in internet humour.Musk is no stranger to wordplay and internet memes, frequently engaging in online jokes and trolling. His use of ""Harry Bōlz"" fit well within his typical approach to social media, where he enjoys posting lighthearted, and sometimes controversial, content. This name change also followed a period of heightened attention on Musk’s management of X, as he had taken over the platform in late 2022 and made several sweeping changes, including layoffs and policy updates.While Musk did not provide a detailed explanation for the name change at the time, he later addressed it in a tweet, confirming that it was indeed a joke. The name was short-lived, as Musk quickly reverted to his usual display name.On December 31, 2024, Musk once again changed his display name, this time to ""Kekius Maximus."" Alongside the name change, he updated his profile picture to an image of Pepe the Frog dressed as a Roman gladiator.The term ""Kekius Maximus"" is a reference to ""kek,"" a term popularised in online gaming and internet meme culture. Originating from World of Warcraft, ""kek"" became associated with internet communities, particularly those engaged in political memes and satire. The name ""Maximus"" is a reference to ancient Roman culture, evoking the title of a powerful general or emperor.By adopting ""Kekius Maximus,"" Musk was making a playful nod to these internet subcultures. The move sparked discussion among his followers, as some saw it as a lighthearted joke, while others speculated that Musk was aligning himself with certain meme-driven online movements. His use of Pepe the Frog, a character that has been widely used in memes across different communities, added another layer of interpretation to his display name change.Musk's tendency to change his display name on X aligns with his broader online persona. He has often embraced internet culture, meme humour, and trolling, using X as a platform to engage with his followers in an informal and often unpredictable manner. His name changes appear to serve multiple purposes:",Elon musk changed his x account name to harry bōlz on tuesday. The billionaire had briefly used the same handle in april 2023.

“So with Civ 7 it's available on console and PC and Switch right away. With regard to others in our lineup, we don't always go across all platforms simultaneously. Historically,

has started with some platforms and then historically moved to other platforms,”

“We have seen PC become a much more and more important part of what used to be a console business, and I wouldn't be surprised to see that trend continue. Of course, there will be a new console generation,”

“When you have a big title in the market and we have many of them coming, historically that has sold consoles. And I think that will happen this year. I don't think tariffs are going to be our friend, but I think there will be a meaningful uptick in console sales in calendar '25 because of the release schedule, not just coming from us, but coming from others. So I'm not concerned about that [console sales falling]. I think the trend that you'd want to focus on is this increasing share of the market that is reflected in PC,”

Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick has teased Grand Theft Auto 6’s PC release. While acknowledging the increasing significance of the PC gaming market, he hinted at a possible PC release for the highly anticipated GTA 6 . However, he didn’t officially confirm the launch date or any other details about the game's PC version.While GTA 6 is currently confirmed for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles, a PC version has not yet been announced.

The UK government is planning to digitise property sales data to speed up home purchases and reduce delays, The Guardian reports.A 12-week initiative has been launched to create standardised rules for data sharing among conveyancers, lenders, and others involved in transactions.Currently, much of the process relies on paper documents or outdated systems, causing delays. The changes aim to improve information sharing and make the process more efficient.""We are streamlining the cumbersome homebuying process so that it is fit for the 21st century, helping homebuyers save money, gain time, and reduce stress while also cutting the number of house sales that fall through,"" housing and planning minister Matthew Pennycook was quoted as saying, according to The Guardian.The initiative is part of a wider housing reform plan, including changes to planning rules, building 1.5 million homes, and leasehold reforms.Buying a home in the UK typically takes months, with delays caused by conveyancing, property searches, and document retrieval.According to Rightmove, the UK's largest online real estate portal, it takes an average of five months from offer acceptance to moving in.Rightmove CEO Johan Svanstrom explained that this follows an initial two-month period for property selection and offer agreement. He added: ""The current process also contributes to an average of more than one in five home sales falling through, and hopefully a better process can help reduce this as well.""The ministry of housing, communities and local government says full digitalisation will allow instant access to information for mortgage providers and surveyors, with single identity verification.Right now, important documents like building control and highways records are mostly on paper. Delays also happen because there are no standardised protocols for accessing and verifying electronic data.To improve this, the ministry is working with HM Land Registry (HMLR) and experts from the Digital Property Market Steering Group.HMLR will lead 10-month pilot projects with councils to test digital data sharing. Plans also include digital identity verification to speed up transactions.New leasehold legislation taking effect on March 3 will give leaseholders more control over service charge costs and remove their obligation to pay freeholder legal fees for right-to-manage claims.These changes could save leaseholders up to £3,000 on legal costs and reduce landlord obstruction tactics.Pennycook said the reforms will help leaseholders ""more easily and cheaply take control of the buildings they live in and clamp down on unreasonable or extortionate charges.""","The uk government is planning to digitise property sales data to speed up home purchases.

Kenya Cracks Down on AI-Generated Content Amid Growing Digital Dissent,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/why-kenya-is-cracking-down-on-viral-ai-generated-content/articleshow/118134942.cms,"This is an AI-generated image, used for representational purposes only.

AI fuels dissent

AI and the battle for narrative control

Kenyans on X: A digital force

A continent-wide crackdown

Kenya's AI dilemma: Innovation or censorship?

A silent war is unfolding in Kenya , not on the streets but in the vast, uncharted world of the internet.Kenya's digital landscape is at a breaking point, as the government clamps down on AI-generated content and social media activism, igniting what many have described as a ticking time bomb of online resistance.In recent months, Kenya has witnessed a series of abductions targeting government critics. Notably, individuals such as cartoonist Gideon Kibet and 24-year-old Billy Mwangi were reportedly abducted after sharing AI-generated images depicting Kenyan President William Ruto in a coffin.The Kenya National Commission on Human Rights reported 82 cases of abductions since June 2024, with at least 29 people still missing as of last month.While some abductees, including Kibet and Mwangi, were released without explanation, Kenyan authorities have denied involvement in the disappearances.With AI-generated protests, viral political satire, and tech-savvy activists challenging authority, officials are scrambling to rein in a digital revolution that refuses to be silenced, leaving the East African nation standing at the crossroads of innovation and intimidation.As artificial intelligence fuels digital dissent, the government is tightening its grip on social media, wielding regulations against an increasingly vocal online population.Mark Kaigwa , a tech visionary and founder of Nairobi-based digital marketing company Nendo, told DW he sees a pattern emerging.""Citizens have, in their own way, been exercising what some would call 'greater than their freedom of expression' and many might describe as well within their rights,"" he said.With AI-generated protest anthems, satirical deepfakes, and viral political memes flooding the digital sphere, Kenya's online activism is evolving faster than authorities can contain it.One of the biggest challenges has been AI tools like Grok , embedded into X (formerly Twitter), allowing users to create shockingly realistic political imagery.With Kenya's leaders frequently the subject of these AI creations, tensions are rising over how to control the technology without stifling free speech.""Ever since Elon Musk and his team integrated Grok … their generative AI platform, you can generate images in there and some of the ones that have been generated have been of political leaders in coffins,"" Kaigwa revealed.""And some of those, of course, can be grotesque and macabre, but the question is now where this tension comes in — because you're no longer talking just about AI, you're talking about AI inside of a very popular social network.""Kenyan Interior Minister Kipchumba Murkomen last month condemned the use of AI-generated images targeting political leaders.""We will ensure that those using social media to threaten others face the full force of the law,"" he said.Kenyan officials have floated the idea of requiring social media companies to set up local offices for better regulatory oversight.However, as Kaigwa pointed out, ""All of them have a physical office, except for X now formerly known as Twitter.""Kenya has long been a digital powerhouse. The country pioneered mobile money with M-Pesa, boasts a thriving startup ecosystem, and has a social media culture that punches far above its weight.The phenomenon of ""Kenyans on X"" has reached global prominence, with online activism shaking governments, brands, and even foreign leaders.Kaigwa recounted how a planned visit by the Dutch king nearly collapsed under the weight of Kenyan digital resistance.""And even recently, we've seen an announcement of the Dutch monarchy, with the king of the Netherlands set to come to Kenya, and the actual Dutch monarchy reporting that their entire IT systems were overwhelmed with people writing emails saying, 'Hey, we don't think you should come.'""The government's struggle to control digital dissent has taken a darker turn, with allegations of online influencers being abducted or threatened.""The current regime of the day has also struggled, really, with what we might call controlling the narrative, or controlling public perception on social networks,"" Kaigwa said.""It's partly the reason that a number of prominent social media figures tend to be some of the ones abducted or who go missing and end up with serious questions regarding the authorities.""Kenya's moves mirror a growing trend across Africa.""If we look to Kenya's neighbour Uganda, they've gone about this quite differently,"" Kaigwa noted.""Over the last few years, they have had a social media tax, which meant that people had to pay the government a certain amount individually to access social networks and their messages and content there, they have done social media shutdowns.""Internet blackouts have become a favoured tool for many African governments, with estimates showing they cost economies billions of dollars in lost revenue. Kenya itself has dipped its toe into these waters.""Even in Kenya, Kenya has had several shutdowns, and most recently, just a few short months ago, I believe, in November, a shutdown of the messaging app Telegram as national exams took place,"" Kaigwa said.While cracking down on digital expression, Kenya is also positioning itself as a leader in AI policy.Ambassador Philip Tigo , Kenya's special envoy for technology and AI, has been actively engaging with global stakeholders to unlock investment and shape international policy.However, Kaigwa argues that Kenya's AI crackdown is selective.""I would argue it's not all of AI, really, here. It's a very particular type of use of AI — so generative AI, which is a subset, and then specifically, it tends to be some of the imagery that's been used.""The broader concern is misinformation and deepfakes, which are already making it harder to distinguish reality from fabrication.""Even if you knew who said it first, there's a question of whether you can find the identity of that person and to what degree that's infringing on their personal rights of expression.""Kenya stands at a defining moment: Will it embrace its reputation as Africa's Silicon Savannah, championing free expression in the digital age? Or will it follow the path of digital repression, controlling the online narrative through regulations and crackdowns?For now, as Kaigwa puts it, ""Kenyans are likely, to some degree, to seek to resist it.""","Kenya's digital landscape is at a breaking point, as the government clamps down on ai-generated content.

'Stop calling it swastika'

Social media users pointed out the difference between the Nazi symbol (left) and Hindu swastika

As Kanye West moves from one controversy to another, his latest has triggered a debate over the misappropriation of the symbols. After Ye's website Monday night was selling only one item -- a T-shirt with the Nazi party symbol -- and it was wrongfully referred to as the swastika symbol, social media users pointed out the difference and the significance between the two and how these two have been confused.Kanye recently had a meltdown on X in which he called himself a Hitler-lover and a Nazi supporter. This unraveling came after he and his wife Bianca Censori made the controversial appearance at the Grammys where Censori was spotted in a see-through dress and Kanye asked her to take off the coat.Kanye promoted his T-shirt in a Super Boal ad which was only aired in Los Angeles. In the ad, he was sitting on a dentist's chair and said he spent all the money for the commercial on his new teeth which in the ad were jewel-encrusted.According to Variety, when the commercial aired Sunday night, the website was selling a range of non-branded clothing, but shortly after it was selling only the Nazi T-shirt. But Monday night, there was no other item on his promoted site except the questionable T-shirt.The Anti-Defamation League in its statement condemning the T-shirt called it a swastika T-shirt. ""As if we needed further proof of Kanye's antisemitism, he chose to put a single item for sale on his website - a T-shirt emblazoned with a swastika. The swastika is the symbol adopted by Hitler as the primary emblem of the Nazis. It galvanized his followers in the 20th century and continues to threaten and instill fear in those targeted by antisemitism and white supremacy,"" it said.Social media users corrected these posts and said Nazi symbol is not swastika. Swarike is a sacred Hindu symbol standing for peace and prosperity. Hitler's symbol is called Hakenkreuz which means 'hooked cross'.",Social media users pointed out that kanye west's website is not selling swastika t-shirts.

Small is big for startups amid funding woes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/small-is-big-for-startups-amid-funding-woes/articleshow/118159571.cms,"MUMBAI: With large deals hard to come by, Indian startup funding is being led by small and mid-sized cheques. On Tuesday, Fintech unicorn Zeta said that it has raised a fresh $50 million from American healthcare firm Optum at a valuation of $2 billion, higher than its last valuation of $1.2 billion while a bunch of investors infused $78 million in a mix of primary and secondary capital into ToneTag, a Bengaluru startup offering payment solutions.Deals in the range of $20-30 million have gathered pace, thanks to an expanding pool of domestic investors who are increasingly co-investing in funding rounds but the overall pace of investments have been muted so far. ""Capital is chasing stable businesses that can generate profits,"" Bhavin Turakhia, co-founder and global CEO at Zeta told TOI.Funding rounds so far have been lower - 126 compared to over 200 rounds that startups recorded through Jan and early Feb last year, data sourced from market research firm Tracxn showed. Total investments stand at under $600 million, lower than the $925 million that companies had garnered by this time last year. ""The bulk of the deals would continue to be in the early to mid-stages ($20-30 million). The pace of deals in the range of $50-100 million would also be slower. There are investors but a lot more cautious investors. There will obviously be some outliers like quick commerce and AI sectors which are going through a hype cycle and will see large deals,"" said Nishit Garg, partner, Asia Investment Team at venture capital firm RTP Global.Big investors like SoftBank and Tiger Global have not been making very large India bets for about a couple of years now, explaining the drop in large deals. SoftBank, for instance, has largely been participating in follow-on investments in existing portfolio startups cutting cheques in the range of $25-60 million while most recently, Tiger Global backed Infra.Market in a $121-million pre-IPO funding round alongside other investors. Following the funding frenzy of 2020 and 2021, some investors became inactive, said analysts. ""We need later stage domestic VC funds who can help complete the funding life cycle of a startup.

"Stocks to buy: Top stock recommendations for February 12, 2025",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/stocks-to-buy-top-stock-recommendations-for-february-12-2025/articleshow/118160877.cms,"UBS has downgraded Eicher Motors to ‘neutral’ from ‘buy’ with a revised price target of Rs 5,650 (+14%) from Rs 5,950 earlier. In the Oct-Dec quarter, the two-wheeler major missed margins by a significant gap. Analysts said that its margin miss was driven by higher launch expenses, more marketing during the festive season and a weaker mix. Also, Eicher's share price has significantly outperformed the two-wheeler pack since March 2024, and its premium to other 2W OEMs has risen significantly and is now in line with the past-five-year mean.Nirmal Bang Institutional Equities has a ‘buy’ recommendation on Apollo Tyres with a target price of Rs 529 (+27%). Analysts said their positive stance on the stock hinged on improving margin and domestic volume outlook, the company’s decision to enter new export markets, its outperformance in the EU and moderate capex intensity, and overall improving return ratios.Nuvama has a ‘buy’ recommendation on Escorts Kubota with a target price of Rs 3,800 (+21%). Analysts expect a revenue CAGR of 15% over FY25–27E, led by Global Kubota (GK)’s support and domestic tractors’ growth. GK’s support is likely in the form of opening of export opportunities and product development support.Axis Securities has a ‘buy’ recommendation on Aurobindo Pharma with a target price of Rs 1,500 (+31%). Analysts feel revenue increases in European, the growth markets, and ARV segments were offset by declines in the US and API segments. The company has allocated Rs 7,000 crore in capex over the past two years, focusing on areas such as Biosimilars and Pen-G (API). The company’s future valuations will largely hinge on the return on invested capital generated from this significant investment.Emkay Global Financial Services has a ‘buy’ recommendation on Nalco with a price target of Rs 275 (+505). Analysts said Nalco posted a solid quarterly performance, with the earnings beat led by higher alumina export volumes, while benefiting from elevated alumina prices. They said that the progress on the alumina refinery project has slowed, with the company delaying it by three months. For Q4, despite the recent correction in alumina prices, we expect Nalco to deliver a strong performance given the one-month lag in price realizations as well as better averaging effect. On balance, our Nalco investment case remains well in shape and we see the recent correction as an entry opportunity into the stock.","Ubs has downgraded eicher motors to ‘neutral’ from ‘buy’ with a revised price target of rs 5,650.

"US dominates imports of almonds, pistachios",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/us-dominates-imports-of-almonds-pistachios/articleshow/118159482.cms,"NEW DELHI: When it comes to almonds and pistachios, the US is doing what China has done in the case of electronics, where the dragon dominates the world trade. American almonds account for nearly 93% of India's import of the commodity, valued at over $1 billion last year, while the share of pistachios was around 84%.The focus on health and wellness, along with higher income levels, has resulted in more demand for dry fruits. And, production is not sufficient to meet the growing demand, which is resulting in higher imports. For instance, against an estimated production of 4,150 tonnes of almonds during this year (Aug-July 2024-25), imports are estimated at 1.9 lakh tonnes, according to the US department of agriculture.Since 2008, imports have soared over 5.5 times in case of Almonds. Ditto for pistachios, where imports went up from around 4,400 tonnes in 2008 to around 13,500 tonnes in 2021. ""There is greater consciousness to eat healthier food and the boards are doing their bit to promote their products,"" said Sumit Saran, India representative of the American Pistachio Growers and Washington Apple Commission.From aggressive branding to pricing, the American varieties have filled shelves in organised retail segments. Things have reached a stage where the Californian variety pops up more on the e-commerce platforms or even on shop shelves than the homegrown variety. India is now the largest market for the California almond sector.""American almonds have secured an over 80% market share in India, owing to very strong marketing campaigns sustained over years, that built on health aspirations and traditional food habits of Indian cuisine. Reduction in import duty in India has also resulted in a boost to the overall business of American almonds,"" said Mohit Singla, chairman of Trade Promotion Council of India, an industry body with focus on food.An Indian industry watcher said American almonds are now commanding a premium and no longer come cheap. ""Their size is bigger and there is little oil content, yet there are few takers for the Asian variants, despite prices being much lower,"" the industry executive said.A govt official said there is some supply coming from Australia, helped by the recent trade deal, which allows zero-duty imports up to a certain quantity. Chile is also a large player in certain segments but the American suppliers are more organised and have lower logistics costs.While Iran used to be the top pistachios supplier, poor supply chain has meant that it is competing with those from UAE. Amid US president Donald Trump's aggressive trade push, American authorities are demanding concessions to ship pecan nuts, while also demanding a ""level-playing field"" with Australian almonds.","American almonds account for nearly 93% of india's import of the commodity.

"Amazon reports strong earnings for Q4, but stocks dip due to outlook for the 1st quarter",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/amazon-reports-strong-earnings-for-q4-but-stocks-dip-due-to-outlook-for-the-1st-quarter/articleshow/117998797.cms,"Amazon on Thursday reported better-than-expected revenue and profits for the holiday shopping period, but its stocks dipped in after-hours trading due to disappointing guidance for the current quarter.The Seattle-based e-commerce and technology company said its revenue for the October-December period totaled $187.8 billion, a 10% jump compared to the same period in 2023. Profits came out to $20 billion while earnings per share reached $1.86, higher than the $1.49 that analysts surveyed by FactSet had anticipated.But the company said it expected revenue for the current quarter to be between $151 billion and 155.5 billion, lower than the $158.56 billion that analysts were expecting. The guidance anticipates ""an unusually large, unfavorable impact"" from foreign exchange rates, it said.Amazon is the biggest online shopping destination in the U.S. and has long been a beneficiary of consumer spending during the holidays. As it has done in recent years, the company in October began offering promotions intended to lure early holiday shoppers. It advertised other discounts during the three-month period, including on major sales days such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday.Amazon on Thursday reported it saw $75.5 billion in revenue for its online shopping business, up 7% from the same period in 2023.Across the retail industry, holiday sales in November and December were better than expected compared with the previous year as lower inflation on holiday goods enticed shoppers to buy, according to The National Retail Federation. Online shopping also saw record sales levels, Adobe Analytics reported in January.Sales for Amazon Web services, the company's prominent cloud computing unit, rose 19% during the fourth quarter. But it fell slightly below analysts expectations.Amazon is one of the biggest players in the competitive tech race around generative artificial intelligence. Like other tech companies, it has ramped up investments in the technology and is spending billions to expand data centers that support AI and cloud computing. The company is also spending money on other equipment, including its own computer chips and those developed by Nvidia. It has also rolled out its own AI models and integrated the generative AI into other parts of its business.In the fourth quarter, Amazon reported spending $27.8 billion on property and equipment, significantly higher than the same period in 2023. Most of the spending was geared towards AI and AWS, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during a call with analysts on Thursday.""We think virtually every application that we know of today is going to be re-invented with AI inside of it,"" Jassy said. ""I think both our business, our customers and shareholders will be happy medium-to-long term that we're pursuing the capital opportunity and the business opportunity in AI.""Jassy also said during the call that Amazon, like many others, was ""impressed"" by DeepSeek, the Chinese artificial intelligence company whose chatbot recently became the most downloaded app in the U.S.Amazon's quarterly report also comes as the retail industry is absorbing a new 10% tariff President Donald Trump imposed on Chinese imports on Tuesday. Tariffs on Canada and Mexico have been put on hold for about a month.Trump also thew out a trade exemption that allowed low-value shipments from China to bypass duties, a loophole that had given an advantage to China-founded e-commerce firms, such as Shein and Temu.The new tariffs could benefit Amazon by increasing costs for its competitors. But it would also impact Chinese sellers who connect with American consumers on the company's shopping platform. Furthermore, it could raise prices on a recently-launched online storefront that Amazon set up to ship low-cost products directly from China. The storefront, called Amazon Haul, was Amazon's answer to Shein and Temu.Additionally, analysts from Morgan Stanley wrote in a Monday note that Amazon's first-party retail business, though which the company sells products purchased from manufacturers, has the highest exposure to the tariffs. The analysts estimate 25% of the merchandise sold through that business comes from China.","Amazon reported better-than-expected revenue and profits for the holiday shopping period.

Dubai-based Inoventive 3D has introduced the region’s first fully 3D-printed boat , marking a significant development in marine manufacturing. The 10-meter-long vessel, named Cyberfin, utilizes advanced large-format 3D printing technology alongside sustainable methods, showcasing a new approach to boat production.Cyberfin, a shark-shaped boat made from recycled ocean waste plastic, was completed in just six days and nine hours, highlighting the efficiency of this innovative technology. With dimensions of 10 meters in length, 2.1 meters in width, and 2.7 meters in height, it can accommodate up to 10 passengers and is officially registered with the Dubai Maritime City Authority (DMCA).“This marks a significant milestone not just for Inoventive 3D but for the entire marine industry,” said M. Ali, Managing Partner of Inoventive 3D. “Our large-format 3D printing capabilities allow us to produce boats in a fraction of the time required by traditional manufacturing methods. With this innovation, we can manufacture 6-7 boats per month, transforming Dubai into a hub for 3D-printed marine solutions.”Traditional boat manufacturing takes 3 to 4 months, but Inoventive 3D’s technology can produce vessels in just weeks—dramatically reducing production timelines. Additionally, the cost of a 3D-printed boat like Cyberfin is approximately one-third of a conventional speedboat, making it a game-changer for cost-conscious buyers.The company’s focus on sustainability is central to its vision. By using recycled materials, Inoventive 3D aims to minimise environmental impact while setting a new benchmark in innovative marine design.This development highlights Dubai’s role in advancing technology-driven industries while reinforcing its commitment to sustainability and innovation.For more information, visit their website: https://inoventive.com/","Dubai-based inoventive 3d has introduced the region’s first fully 3d-printed boat.
