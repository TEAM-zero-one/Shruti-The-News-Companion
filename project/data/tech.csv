"Microsoft responds to H-1B criticism after JD Vance's rebuke, says job eliminations not related to visa program",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/microsoft-responds-to-h-1b-criticism-after-jd-vances-rebuke-says-job-eliminations-not-related-to-visa-program/articleshow/122983337.cms,"After JD Vance's rebuke, Microsoft says its H-1B applications have nothing to do with layoffs.





Microsoft has responded to the criticism that it fired American employees to hire foreign cheap labor saying that H-1B applications are no way related to the recent job eliminations and many employees on H-1Bs also lost their jobs. The statement comes amid an intense debate over Microsoft's announcement of 9,000 layoffs while the company reportedly made 4712 applications for H-1Bs.“Our H-1B applications are in no way related to the recent job eliminations in part because employees on H-1B’s also lost their roles. In the past 12 months, 78% of the petitions we filed were extensions for existing employees and not new employees coming to the U.S.,” the company said in a statement emailed to CFO Dive by a spokesperson.Vice President JD Vance recently slammed Microsoft and he said it makes no sense to him that companies fire Americans and then claim that they can't find workers in America and bring in foreign workers. ""You see some big tech companies where they'll lay off 9,000 workers, and then they'll apply for a bunch of overseas visas. And I sort of wonder; that doesn't totally make sense to me,"" he said.""That displacement and that math worries me a bit. And what the president has said, he said very clearly: We want the very best and the brightest to make America their home. We want them to build great companies and so forth. But I don't want companies to fire 9,000 American workers and then to go and say, 'We can't find workers here in America.' That's a bulls**t story,"" he said.The H-1B visa program that allows companies to hire foreign workers has emerged as a contentious issue while the Donald Trump administration is planning a major overhaul of the program. H-1B runs the Silicon Valley but this goes against Trump's promised America First policy prompting MAGA activists to call for an end to this program.",Microsoft has responded to the criticism that it fired american employees to hire foreign cheap labor.

SRIHARIKOTA: The Nasa-Isro Synthetic Aperture Radar (Nisar) satellite, capable of mapping the entire globe in 12 days and spotting minute changes, was successfully launched by GSLV-F16 on Wednesday evening, marking a new milestone in global Earth observation and in the India-US space collaboration.The rocket placed the 2,393kg satellite in a 747km sun synchronous polar orbit -- a first for a GSLV -- around 19 minutes after it lifted off from the second launch pad at Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota.“Extremely happy to announce that GSLV-F16 has successfully injected the Nasa- Isro Synthetic Aperture Radar Satellite weighing 2393kg into its intended orbit. This is our 102nd launch from Sriharikota and the eight day mission of GSLV,” Isro chairman V Narayanan said.“This is the first GSLV mission to the sun synchronous polar orbit. Till date all the GSLV missions have been through GTO. Several analyses and studies were carried out to make this mission a grand success. All the systems performance was normal, as expected and as predicted and today we achieved the intended orbit. Actually, we have got an orbit of less than 3km against a permissible level of 20km,” he said.The Nisar observatory, which has been under development for more than a decade, carries a first-of-its-kind dual-band — L and S bands — radar satellite with a capability for high-resolution, as small as a few centimetres, mapping above and below the Earth’s surface.This will help scientists track subtle changes in Earth’s ecosystems, including sea level rise, groundwater and natural hazards like earthquakes, floods, volcanoes and landslides, aiding early warnings, disaster response and infrastructure damage assessment.The Nisar mission’s primary objectives are to study land and ice deformation, land ecosystems and oceanic regions in areas of common interest to the US and Indian science communities.The Isro chairman said, “The Nisar satellite is a significant milestone for both the Department of Space, India and Nasa JPL being the first joint development project undertaken by the two major spacefaring nations. Nisar is an all-weather day night imaging satellite. The potential application from this satellite is huge and the global science community is eagerly awaiting the satellite data for their respective research and usage. The implementation arrangement between Isro and Nasa for a joint exploration satellite mission was signed on Sept 30, 2014. Since then, the realization of the satellite has been steady.""""Over the past so many years the Nisar mission has brought the two space agencies much closer than ever before and the continuous interactions at various levels during the course of project execution has enriched both sides. We wish the scientific community from both sides the exciting days ahead. I am sure this data is going to be highly useful for the global scientific community of the globe. And when the data is going to come every 12 days it is not going to be used by one or two countries, but the entire globe,” he added.Wednesday's mission was GSLV’s 18th flight and 12th flight with the indigenous cryogenic stage. It was also the 102nd launch from Sriharikota.According to Isro, the dual-band synthetic aperture radar employs polarimetric and interferometric techniques and an advanced, novel SweepSAR technique, which provides high-resolution and large-swath imagery. Nisar will image the global land and ice-covered surfaces, including islands, sea ice and selected oceans every 12 days.It will help measure biomass and its changes, track changes in the extent of active crops, understand changes in wetland extent, map Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, dynamics of sea ice and mountain glaciers and characterise land surface deformation related to seismicity, volcanism, landslides and subsidence and uplift associated with changes in subsurface aquifers, hydrocarbon reservoirs and others.While Isro built the S-band radar system, data handling and high-speed downlink system, the spacecraft and the launch system, Nasa delivered the L-band radar system, high-speed downlink system, the solid-state recorder, GPS receiver and the 9m boom hoisting the 12m reflector.Isro will handle satellite commanding and operations while Nasa will provide the orbit manoeuvre plan and radar operations plan.The Nisar mission will be aided with ground station support of both Isro and Nasa for downloading of the acquired images, which, after the necessary processing, will be disseminated to the user community.","The rocket placed the 2,393kg satellite in a 747km sun synchronous polar orbit -- a first for a gslv.

‘Two-eyed’ NISAR satellite will scan every piece of Earth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/two-eyed-nisar-satellite-will-scan-every-piece-of-earth/articleshow/123005655.cms,"Nasa's deputy associate administrator Casey Swails, in presence of Isro chairman V Narayanan, addresses scientists after successful launch of GSLV-F16

NEW DELHI: The NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) programme cost the US and India over $1.5 billion. But there is an important question to be asked: What was the need for such a huge investment when hundreds of earth observation satellites are already in space? The answer is that the world had never developed a dual-frequency band satellite.NISAR has two synthetic aperture radars of different bands that will operate in tandem. It will be a ‘satellite with two eyes in space” keeping a hawk’s eye on the Earth and scanning every piece of our planet for minute details.“Our planet surface undergoes constant and meaningful change. Some change happens slowly. Some happens abruptly. Some changes are large, while some are subtle,” Karen St Germain, director of Nasa's Earth Science division, explained. Calling NISAR “the most sophisticated radar we've ever built and a model for the next generation of Earth-observation capabilities”, Germain said, “We'll see land substance and swelling, movement, deformation and melting of mountain glaciers and ice sheets covering both Greenland and Antarctica, and, of course, we'll see wildfires”.It's “a first-of-its-kind, jewel radar satellite that will change the way we study our home planet and better predict a natural disaster before it strikes,” Nasa’s science mission chief Nicky Fox said ahead of liftoff.Congratulating Isro and Nasa, space minister Jitendra Singh called the NISAR mission a “game changer in precise management of disasters”.The L-band SAR, provided by Nasa, uses higher wavelength microwaves and can penetrate tree cover for vegetation, sand and ice. It will capture minute details of surface undulations and see through dense forest cover. The S-band SAR, provided by Isro, which has a shorter wavelength, will capture larger features like crop fields and water bodies.L-band and S-band SARs together will provide a comprehensive picture of the observed area — generating detailed imagery that is not possible even by integrating data of two separate satellites with different bands. Putting two radars of different bands on the same satellite was therefore the biggest engineering challenge for both Nasa and Isro, which they finally managed to overcome, though it took them 10 years to develop the 2,392-kg marvel.Equipped with a 12-metre dish that will unfold in space, NISAR will record nearly all of Earth's land and ice twice every 12 days from an altitude of 747 km.By picking up tiny changes in the vertical movement of the Earth's surface — as little as 1 cm (0.4 inches) — scientists will be able to detect precursors to natural and human-caused disasters, from earthquakes, landslides and volcanoes to aging infrastructure like dams and bridges.The data from NISAR will be turned into three-dimensional maps that will not only help scientists and policymakers respond to natural disasters but also assist farmers by monitoring soil moisture and crop growth.Indian space industry representative Anil Prakash, DG, SatCom Industry Association (SIA-India), hailed the NISAR mission and Indo-US space collaboration. ""The successful Nasa-Isro collaboration on the $1.5 billion NISAR mission marks a defining moment in global space diplomacy. It brings together cutting-edge American L-band SAR systems and India’s expertise in engineering, integration, and cost-effective launch capability via GSLV-F16,” Prakash said. ""Isro’s contribution, including the S-band radar, satellite bus, launch services, and mission operations, once again demonstrates India’s ability to build and deliver complex systems with remarkable reliability. With a legacy of over 400 international satellite launches, Isro has emerged not just as a collaborator, but as a co-architect of next-generation Earth science missions,” he added.",Nisar has two synthetic aperture radars of different bands that will operate in tandem.

NISAR a milestone in Indo-US space ties; space minister says sat will be a ‘game changer in disaster management’,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/nisar-a-milestone-in-indo-us-space-ties-space-minister-says-sat-will-be-a-game-changer-in-disaster-management/articleshow/123005639.cms,"NISAR Will Help Global Community Monitor Earth Changes: ISRO Chairman V Narayanan

NEW DELHI: The successful launch of the world’s most expensive and unique earth observation satellite NISAR, jointly developed by US and Indian scientists over a decade, has given a big push to Indo-US space cooperation and has been hailed as a milestone in space collaboration between the two countries under the leadership of US President Donald Trump and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.Wednesday’s launch came weeks after Nasa and Isro successfully collaborated on the Axiom-4 mission, under which Indian astronaut Shubanshu Shukla was sent to the International Space Station for microgravity experiments.Congratulating Isro and Nasa, space minister Jitendra Singh called the NISAR mission a “game changer in precise management of disasters”.In a post on X, he said: “NISAR’s capacity to penetrate through fogs, dense clouds, ice layers, etc., makes it a pathbreaking enabler for the aviation and shipping sectors. The inputs from NISAR will benefit the entire world community…in the true spirit of ‘Vishwabandhu’.” He also expressed pride in being “associated with the Department of Space at a time when Isro is registering one global milestone after the other”.Isro chairman V Narayanan said NISAR “has brought the two agencies closer than ever before”.Though Nasa began studying concepts for a Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) mission, inspired by the National Academy of Sciences' decadal survey of the agency's Earth science program in 2007, the US chose to collaborate with India for a huge SAR-based satellite, signing a formal agreement for the NISAR programme in 2014.The then Nasa administrator Charles Bolden and then Isro chairman K Radhakrishnan signed the pact for production and launch of NISAR in Toronto on Sept 30, 2014.Before 2014, US and India had collaborated on a slew of space missions, including the Chandrayaan-1 mission, under which saw Nasa sent its payload (Moon Mineralogy Mapper) on board Isro’s spacecraft for the moon mission, which played a crucial role in finding water on Moon. But the NISAR programme is said to be the first big-ticket ($1.5 billion) satellite mission invested in by both sides. Nasa has contributed L-Band SAR, a high-rate telecommunication subsystem, GPS receivers and a deployable 12-metre unfurlable antenna. Isro, on its part, has provided S-Band SAR payload, the spacecraft bus to accommodate both payloads, GSLV-F16 launch vehicle and all associated launch services.",The successful launch of the world’s most expensive and unique earth observation satellite nisar has given a big push to indo-us space cooperation.

J&K Medical Council sets social media guidelines for doctors,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/jk-medical-council-sets-social-media-guidelines-for-doctors/articleshow/123003984.cms,"SRINAGAR: A week after an MBBS student filmed his career’s first stint in the operation theatre and posted it online as a reel, Jammu and Kashmir Medical Council (JKMC) on Wednesday issued social media guidelines for doctors in the Union Territory, prohibiting them from sharing images or videos of treatment results, surgeries, procedures, or healed patients.In the video, which was widely circulated on social media platforms, an MBBS student at GMC Srinagar’s LD Hospital, excitedly shared that he was about to perform his first surgery in the OT, and proceeded to the labour room, thus exposing the parts of the patient’s body.Taking serious cognisance, JKMC issued a set of guidelines to ensure such violations do not recur. While acknowledging the role of social media as “a powerful communication tool”, the Council, in a statement, cautioned against its misuse, particularly in ways that compromised patient privacy, confidentiality or autonomy.JKMC directed registered doctors to follow the set guidelines on the professional conduct of Registered Medical Practitioners (RMPs) regarding the use of social media platforms in adherence to Indian Medical Council Regulations, 2002.“RMPs must not advertise services, claim superiority, or engage in self-promotional activities (posting self-photographs or publicity on signboards beyond basic details).Permitted announcements are — starting practice, change of address, or temporary absence,” the JKMC statement said.Patient information — including images, scans, treatments, and outcomes — must not be disclosed without explicit and informed consent, JKMC said. “Consent is invalid if the patient is in a compromised physical, mental, or emotional state. Patient testimonials, endorsements, or reviews cannot be solicited or shared in any case on social media,” it added.The Council asked RMPs to maintain dignity and avoid behaviour that discredits the profession on any media platform. “Sharing factual, verifiable, and non-misleading educational content is allowed, within one’s expertise. Public discussions of treatment or prescribing medications online is prohibited; patients must be directed to proper telemedicine or in-person consultations,” it said.Online presence must reflect medical ethics, truthfulness, and respect for the profession, patients, colleagues and the community, JKMC said, urging doctors to share content responsibly.","An mbbs student filmed his career’s first stint in the operation theatre and posted it online as a reel.

Calgary Flames lock in Martin Pospisil with long-term contract after strong 2024–25 NHL season

Key Flames players still unsigned as Calgary prioritizes Martin Pospisil extension

FAQs:

1. When does Martin Pospisil’s new contract start?

2. What nationality is Martin Pospisil?

The Calgary Flames have signed forward Martin Pospisil to a three-year contract extension worth $7.5 million, his agent Dan Milstein confirmed. The deal carries an average annual value of $2.5 million and begins in the 2026–27 season. Pospisil, who was set to enter the final year of his previous contract, will now bypass restricted free agency next summer, keeping him under Calgary’s control through the 2028–29 season.The 25-year-old Slovak forward played a key role for the Flames throughout the 2024–25 season, recording 25 points (4 goals, 21 assists) in 81 games while finishing third in the NHL with 301 hits. His physical edge remained intact, but Pospisil showed marked improvement in his discipline, cutting his penalty minutes from 109 in his rookie campaign to 84.He averaged 13:48 of ice time per game, earning brief power-play minutes in a net-front role and also seeing expanded usage at center. Pospisil won 40.8% of his 174 faceoffs, respectable for a player transitioning from the wing. With little change expected in the Flames’ forward group heading into the 2025–26 season, he’s projected to continue in a similar bottom-six role as his current $1 million cap hit remains in effect for one more year.While Pospisil’s new deal reflects his value as a reliable, energy-driven forward, the timing of the extension has raised eyebrows. Restricted free agent Connor Zary remains unsigned for the upcoming season, and other key names, center Mikael Backlund, defenseman Rasmus Andersson, and goalie Dustin Wolf will all need new deals for 2026–27.Andersson, in particular, could be a trade candidate if no progress is made, while Wolf’s future looms large given his rising profile as a potential starting goaltender. Even so, locking in Pospisil signals Calgary’s intent to preserve roster continuity and reward players who bring consistent effort and edge.The Flames have made a clear vote of confidence in Martin Pospisil, securing him for the long term after back-to-back impactful seasons. With other major contract decisions ahead, Calgary’s front office is banking on internal development and Pospisil’s evolving game to keep the franchise competitive.The extension begins in the 2026–27 NHL season.He is Slovakian.Also Read: NHL trade rumors: Nazem Kadri could join Montreal Canadiens after Toronto Maple Leafs blocked by Calgary Flames","The calgary flames have signed forward martin pospisil to a three-year contract extension.

Thinking Machines Lab: a startup with billion-dollar belief

Why Murati’s team said no to Meta

A name to watch in AI’s future





Mira Murati, the Albanian-American tech visionary behind some of the most significant breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, is once again in the spotlight—this time for turning down an eye-watering $1 billion offer from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg . As the former CTO of OpenAI and now the founder of the AI startup Thinking Machines Lab, Murati has become one of the most influential figures in the global AI race. Her team's unanimous rejection of Meta’s massive offer speaks volumes about their confidence in her leadership and their belief in the startup’s long-term vision.Before launching Thinking Machines Lab, Mira Murati served as the chief technology officer at OpenAI, one of the most influential positions in the modern AI world. During her tenure, she played a pivotal role in leading the development of groundbreaking technologies such as ChatGPT, DALL·E, and Codex—systems that have since transformed the way people interact with artificial intelligence. Her work helped bring generative AI into the mainstream, sparking a global wave of innovation across industries from education and healthcare to design and coding.Murati wasn’t just a technical leader—she was a strategic visionary. At OpenAI, she emphasized the importance of safety, alignment, and responsible development, pushing the organization to think deeply about the societal impact of powerful AI systems.Internally, she earned the reputation of being the “AI brain” behind OpenAI’s most ambitious projects, praised for her calm, focused demeanor and her ability to guide multidisciplinary teams through intense periods of innovation. Her combination of engineering precision and human-centered thinking set the stage for her next bold move: founding her own AI company.Founded in early 2025, Thinking Machines Lab has rapidly emerged as one of the most-watched AI startups. Despite not launching a single product yet, the company recently raised a stunning $2 billion seed round at a valuation nearing $12 billion, led by Andreessen Horowitz. The startup’s goal: to create customizable, interpretable, and widely accessible AI systems that could redefine the AI landscape. Industry insiders say the company’s stealth mode only adds to its mystique. With Murati at the helm, expectations are sky-high for what comes next.According to a Wired report, Zuckerberg's Meta offered some of Murati’s team members compensation packages ranging from $200 million to $1 billion to join its newly launched Superintelligence Lab. But every single offer was turned down. Sources say the Thinking Machines Lab team believes their equity in the startup has the potential to be worth far more—and more importantly, they value their independence and Murati’s vision over big-tech paychecks.In a tech industry where massive paydays often drive decisions, the loyalty displayed by Murati’s team stands out. The rejection of Meta’s lucrative offers highlights their belief in the startup’s mission and long-term potential. Many observers also note that the chance to help shape AI’s future from the ground up, without the constraints of a corporate giant, is a rare and meaningful opportunity—one Murati has worked hard to create.Mira Murati’s leadership has already been recognized worldwide—she was featured in Time’s 100 Most Influential People in AI (2024) and Fortune’s 100 Most Powerful Women in Business (2023). With Thinking Machines Lab gaining momentum and Meta's billion-dollar offers rebuffed, Murati has solidified her place not just as a builder of AI—but as a shaper of its future.",Mira murati is the founder of ai startup thinking machines lab.

Edmonton Oilers face uncertainty as Connor McDavid eyes short-term NHL contract extension at potential record salary,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/edmonton-oilers-face-uncertainty-as-connor-mcdavid-eyes-short-term-nhl-contract-extension-at-potential-record-salary/articleshow/123005572.cms,"Perry Nelson/USA TODAY Sports

Connor McDavid’s next NHL contract may set salary record but raises concerns over short-term deal

Edmonton Oilers eager to lock in Connor McDavid with contract extension amid uncertain NHL future

FAQs:

1. What kind of contract is McDavid considering next?

2. Who is Connor McDavid?

As Connor McDavid enters the final year of his current contract, the Edmonton Oilers are facing growing uncertainty about their franchise star’s future. McDavid, widely regarded as the best player in the world, is reportedly considering a short-term extension rather than the maximum eight-year deal the Oilers would prefer. Speculation suggests his next contract could carry an AAV between $16–17.5 million, potentially the highest in NHL history.According to NHL insider Frank Seravalli, McDavid is leaning toward a shorter contract, possibly around four years, rather than committing to a full eight-year extension. While no final decision has been made, Seravalli estimates McDavid’s next deal could fall in the $16–17.5 million AAV range, which would eclipse Leon Draisaitl’s current league-leading $14 million AAV.For Edmonton, that presents a tough balancing act. A shorter deal gives McDavid flexibility to reassess the team’s direction in a few years, while the Oilers risk losing him sooner if their Stanley Cup window doesn’t materialize. Still, from a player standpoint, a shorter term at a record-setting salary offers McDavid both maximum earnings and full control over his future.McDavid’s current eight-year, $12.5 million AAV contract signed in 2017, expires at the end of the 2025–26 season.The Oilers are hoping to avoid any risk of him reaching unrestricted free agency next July, making this extension their top priority. While they’d ideally secure him long-term through 2034, the franchise may have to settle for a compromise to ensure he stays.Seravalli notes that even an eight-year deal wouldn't necessarily guarantee McDavid’s long-term stay, given his immense leverage. If Edmonton fails to stay competitive, McDavid could still request a trade down the line. His influence within the organization is unmatched, making the structure of his next deal less about commitment and more about flexibility.Connor McDavid’s contract talks have put the spotlight back on Edmonton’s long-term trajectory. While the Oilers remain committed to keeping their superstar, the possibility of a shorter, high-value deal introduces new pressure on the franchise. Whether McDavid signs for four or eight years, one thing is clear: he’s set to redefine the NHL’s salary landscape.Reports suggest he may sign a shorter-term deal, possibly around four years.He’s the captain of the Edmonton Oilers and one of the best players in the NHL.Also Read: Calgary Flames sign Martin Pospisil to three-year, $7.5M NHL contract extension",Connor mcdavid is reportedly considering a short-term extension.

How the plan works



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sells $36.4 million in stock



Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has recently sold 202,797 shares of the company's stock worth approximately $39 million. According to the filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) the transactions were executed between July 24 to July 28. The shares were sold at prices ranging from $172.07 to $176.37, near Nvidia’s 52-week high of $177. Despite this sale of stock, Huang still owns more than 73.8 million shares of the company. This recent sale of stock by Huang is part of a prearranged 10b5-1 trading plan which was adopted by the Nvidia CEO in March this year. The trading plan is created to allow company insiders to sell shares without facing any accusations of insider trading. The sale is said to be a part of a planned disinvestment strategy by Huang. However, the key to understanding these sales lies in the nature of a Rule 10b5-1 plan.The rule 10b5-1 is a regulation created by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The rule enables the corporate insiders to sell company shares via a predefined trading plan. It also acts as an affirmative defense against the charges of insider trading.- Pre-planned transitions: The plan enable the insiders to establish a written trading plan at a time when they are not in possession of material non-public information (MNPI) about their company.- Specific parameters: The plan must also reveal the amount, price and date of trades or include a formula for determining them.- No discretion: Once the plan is established, after the insider cannot exercise any influence over the trades. The transactions are they automatically executed as per the pre-set schedule.- Transparency: These trading plans are disclosed publicly via the SEC filings in order to provide transparency to the market.The main objective of the rule 10b5-1 trading plan is to enable insiders to diversify their portfolios, manage liquidity and meet personal financial obligations. So, in case of Nvidia CEO selling stocks under a Rule 10b5-1 plan suggest that these transactions were scheduled well in advance before the recent market developments or company-specific news.This is the second time in July that Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang sold the company stocks. Earlier in July, Huang sold 225,000 shares of company stock worth around $36.4 million. According to the recent filings with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), the transactions were executed between July 8 and July 10. This transaction made by Huang follows the previous batch of stock which he sold in June this year. Last month Huang offloaded 1,00,000 shares in the span of two days.","N nvidia ceo jensen huang has sold 202,797 shares of the company's stock worth approximately $39 million.

AI-powered growth and record investments

From modest beginnings to Silicon Valley’s summit

After a decade at the helm of Alphabet, Sundar Pichai has officially joined the ranks of billionaires, marking a rare achievement for a non-founding tech CEO. Pichai, who took over as CEO of Google in 2015 and became Alphabet’s chief in 2019, now holds a net worth of $1.1 billion, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The milestone comes after Alphabet’s market value soared by over $1 trillion since early 2023, delivering 120% returns to investors. Pichai’s rise has been defined by his leadership through multiple technological shifts, from mobile and cloud computing to AI. As Alphabet’s shares hit record highs, his decade-long stewardship has culminated in both financial success and strategic transformation.While tech billionaires are often company founders, Pichai’s entry into the billionaire club is different. He holds just 0.02% of Alphabet’s economic stake, currently valued at around $440 million. Most of his net worth comes from share sales and performance-based compensation over the past ten years. Bloomberg reports that he has sold over $650 million in stock during his tenure. If he had retained all his shares, they would now be worth more than $2.5 billion. Despite the modest stake, Pichai’s long-term vision and steady leadership have driven massive growth in Alphabet’s core businesses.August 2025 marks ten years since Pichai became CEO of Google. In that time, Alphabet has expanded rapidly, turning once-nascent divisions like YouTube, Cloud, Play, and Subscriptions into billion-dollar engines. In a recent post on X, Pichai highlighted that in 2015, Alphabet’s total revenue was $75 billion, whereas YouTube and Google Cloud alone are now generating an annual run rate of $110 billion. Under his leadership, Alphabet restructured into a parent holding company, sharpened its AI focus, and increased its global footprint.A major factor in Alphabet’s recent trillion-dollar surge has been its aggressive AI investments . The company spent $50 billion in 2023 alone on infrastructure, semiconductors, and data centers to support its AI ambitions. It also raised its 2025 capital expenditure forecast by $10 billion, reaching $85 billion, most of which is earmarked for AI infrastructure. “Our AI infrastructure investments are crucial to meeting the growth in demand for cloud customers,” Pichai said during the Q2 earnings call. Alphabet’s DeepMind acquisition in 2014 for $400 million has also paid off, helping the company stay ahead in the AI race. Pichai's rise reflects a new era where operational excellence, not just founding status, can build tech empires.Born in Tamil Nadu, India, Sundar Pichai’s journey to Silicon Valley is one of resilience and brilliance. He grew up in a two-room apartment, with his first telephone arriving when he was 12. A scholarship brought him to Stanford in 1993, with a one-way plane ticket that reportedly cost more than his father’s annual salary. Pichai joined Google in 2004, led the development of Chrome, and later oversaw Android, before rising to the top job.Sundar Pichai is also known for his calm, consensus-driven leadership style, which has earned him respect in an industry often defined by bold personalities. In recent years, he has become increasingly vocal on topics like AI regulation, digital privacy, and ethical tech, positioning Alphabet as a global thought leader beyond just innovation.Outside of tech, Pichai has also ventured into sports. He is reportedly part of a group of executives that acquired a 49% stake in the London Spirit cricket team for $182 million. The team competes in The Hundred, a professional cricket league launched in the UK in 2020. While his wealth may not rival that of Alphabet founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, worth $171.2 billion and $160.4 billion respectively, Pichai's path to the billionaire club is proof that transformational leadership, even without a founding stake, can build both companies and fortunes. His rise underscores a shift in Silicon Valley’s power dynamics—where disciplined execution rivals disruptive invention. As Alphabet charts its future, Pichai’s story stands as a model for aspiring global leaders in tech and beyond.","Sundar pichai is now worth $1.1 billion, according to the bloomberg billionaires index.

Apple working on its foldable iPhone



In an awkward slip-up, Apple ’s official support account on Chinese social media platform — Weibo , accidentally posted a promotional video for Samsung’s recently launched Galaxy Z Flip 7 smartphone. The smartphone is said to be a direct competition to Apple’s rumoured foldable iPhone . The embarrassing incident, which saw a video for the Samsung Galaxy Z Flip7 appear on an Apple-branded channel, has since been rectified, with the video promptly taken down. As reported by 9to5Mac, the post on Apple’s support account was originally created to highlight Apple’s parental control features for App Store downloads. However, instead of embedding an Apple-branded video, the account accidentally included a clip showcasing Samsung’s latest foldable smartphone .As reported by 9to5Mac, the blunder happened when Apple’s support account was promoting the parental controls the company offer for App Store downloads. Instead of adding the Apple related video, the post accidentally carried a commercial for the recently launched Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 7.While the reason for the mixup is not known right now but two primary theories are circulating. The most probable explanation suggests a simple copy-paste error, where the individual managing the account may have intended to embed an Apple video but still had a link to the Samsung promotion in their paste buffer. Another possibility raised is that the account is managed by a local marketing agency in China that handles campaigns for both Apple and Samsung.Apple is said to be working on its own foldable device. The Cupertino-based tech giant is expected to launch its first foldable iPhone in the second half of next year, according to JP Morgan. In a note to clients (via CNBC), JP Morgan analyst Samik Chatterjee said “With the upgrades to the iPhone 17 series to be released this fall expected to be fairly limited, investor focus has already turned to the 2026 fall launches with Apple expected to launch its first foldable iPhone as part of the iPhone 18 lineup in September 2026”, The note further stated that Apple foldable iPhone may feature a book-style fold similar to Samsung’s Galaxy Z Fold series.","Apple’s official support account on chinese social media platform — weibo accidentally posted a promotional video for samsung's recently launched galaxy z flip 7 smartphone.
