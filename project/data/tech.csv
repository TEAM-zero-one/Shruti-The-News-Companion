“Delhi Fully Prepared For AI Summit,” Says Kuljeet Chahal As NDMC Unveils Grand Illumination Drive

NEW DELHI: Govt on Sunday unveiled India's first comprehensive AI governance guidelines, choosing a light-touch, principle-based rulebook over a rigid new law to manage the risks of artificial intelligence while keeping innovation on track. The framework seeks to curb bias, misuse and opacity in AI systems without slowing down adoption, signalling India's intent to shape responsible AI governance ahead of the five-day AI Impact Summit 2026, which begins on Monday.The guidelines lay out how AI should be developed and used across sectors such as healthcare, education, agriculture, finance and governance. Instead of prescribing strict controls, the framework is anchored in seven broad principles, or ""sutras"", that are meant to guide both policymakers and industry.These include trust as the foundation, 'people first', innovation over restraint, fairness and equity, accountability, understandable by design, and safety, resilience and sustainability. Together, they emphasise that AI systems must support human decision-making, remain transparent, avoid discrimination and be deployed with clear safeguards.A key feature of the guidelines is reliance on existing laws.Officials said many AI-related risks are already covered under current legal frameworks such as IT rules, data protection laws, and criminal statutes. Instead of rushing into a standalone AI law, govt has opted for periodic reviews and targeted changes as technology evolves.The framework also proposes creation of new national institutions to oversee AI governance. These include an AI governance group to coordinate policy across ministries, a technology and policy expert committee to provide expert inputs, and an AI safety institute to focus on testing standards, safety research and risk assessment.The guidelines spell out expectations for AI developers and deployers. They call for transparency reports, clear disclosures when AI-generated content is used, grievance redressal mechanisms for people harmed by AI systems, and cooperation with regulators. High-risk applications, especially those affecting safety, rights or livelihoods, are expected to follow stronger safeguards and human oversight.Officials said the approach reflects India's belief that AI should not remain limited to a few firms or countries, but be widely deployed to solve real-world problems while remaining trustworthy.By prioritising innovation alongside safeguards, govt aims at positioning India not just as a major user of AI, but as a global voice in shaping responsible, inclusive AI governance aligned with the vision of 'Viksit Bharat 2047'.","The framework seeks to curb bias, misuse and opacity in ai systems without slowing down adoption.

The politics of scent

The actor at the centre

More than just a soap

When a bar of soap becomes the centre of a political slugfest, one knows the story runs deeper than lather and fragrance.The appointment of actor Tamannaah Bhatia as the new brand ambassador of Karnataka ’s iconic Mysuru Sandal Soap has triggered a heated debate that cuts across politics, identity, branding strategy and regional pride.What began as a marketing announcement has spiralled into a controversy over language, representation and the cultural ownership of a 108-year-old legacy product.At the heart of the row is Karnataka Soaps and Detergents Limited (KSDL), the government-owned company that manufactures Mysuru Sandal Soap. Founded during the reign of Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar, the brand is not merely a commercial product. For many Kannadigas, it is an aromatic symbol of heritage.The controversy intensified after Karnataka industries minister MB Patil announced that Tamannaah Bhatia would serve a two-year tenure as brand ambassador for KSDL. The actor reportedly signed for a fee of approximately Rs 6.2 crore. Her contract, which was finalised last year, formally came into effect this month.The announcement coincided with the relaunch of Mysuru Sandal Soap in refreshed packaging and a broader strategy to reposition the brand for national and global markets.Several advertisements featuring the actor were unveiled at an event in Bengaluru, along with an expanded portfolio of nearly 60 products.But almost immediately, political opposition emerged.Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) MP K Sudhakar accused the Congress-led Karnataka government of displaying what he called an “anti-Kannada mindset”.He questioned why a Mumbai-born actor was chosen to represent a brand rooted in Karnataka’s cultural identity when several Kannada film stars enjoy national and international recognition.He named actors such as Ramya, Rashmika Mandanna, Srinidhi Shetty , Pooja Hegde and Rukmini Vasanth, arguing that they have carried Kannada cinema to wider audiences and would have been more appropriate faces of the brand.The debate quickly moved from business logic to emotional ownership.To understand why a soap can trigger such strong reactions, one must go back to its origins.Mysuru Sandal Soap was born in 1916 in the princely state of Mysore. At the time, the region was rich in sandalwood, a precious and aromatic resource. During the First World War, the export of sandalwood was disrupted. Faced with surplus stock, the Mysore administration decided to explore value addition.Under the guidance of chemists and the encouragement of Maharaja Nalwadi Krishnaraja Wadiyar, the government established a soap factory that used pure sandalwood oil. The idea was simple but visionary. Instead of exporting raw material, produce a finished product of premium quality.The result was Mysore Sandal Soap, one of the few soaps in the world made with genuine sandalwood oil.In 1980, the operations were reorganised under Karnataka Soaps and Detergents Limited (KSDL), a state enterprise. Over the decades, KSDL expanded into detergents, cosmetics and other personal care products. Yet the flagship soap remained its crown jewel.For many households in Karnataka, the soap is associated with childhood memories, temple visits, wedding gifts and the distinctive scent of sandalwood that lingers long after use.It is not merely hygiene. It is nostalgia.Minister MB Patil has defended the appointment, saying the decision was based purely on marketing considerations. According to him, KSDL is entering a transformative phase with ambitious targets. The company aims to achieve a turnover of Rs 5,000 crore by 2030.Currently, the company’s turnover is expected to touch around Rs 2,000 crore this year, with profits reportedly exceeding Rs 500 crore. However, only a small percentage of sales occur within Karnataka. Patil has said that roughly 8 to 12 per cent of sales are in the state, with significant portions in Telangana, other southern states, north India and a small international presence.The government’s argument is straightforward. If the brand wants to expand aggressively in North India and overseas markets, it needs a face with pan-India recognition.Tamannaah Bhatia, though born and brought up in Mumbai, has worked extensively in Tamil, Telugu and Hindi cinema. With millions of followers on social media and cross regional appeal, the government says she fits the bill.Officials have stated that several names were evaluated, including actors from Karnataka. However, some were reportedly endorsing competing brands, which made them ineligible under marketing norms.The state government maintains that branding decisions must align with commercial objectives, not political sentiment.Critics, however, view the decision through a different lens.For them, Mysuru Sandal Soap is intertwined with Karnataka’s linguistic and cultural pride. In a state where language identity remains politically sensitive, the selection of a non-Kannada-speaking actor to represent a heritage brand has symbolic implications.Mysuru MP Yaduveer Wadiyar , a descendant of the Mysore royal family, publicly questioned the rationale. He argued that soap is not gender-specific and that a cricketer or prominent Kannadiga could have been chosen. He also clarified that he had no interest in serving as brand ambassador himself, despite his name circulating on social media.Forest minister Eshwar Khandre defended the appointment but assured that Kannadigas would continue to receive priority in other contexts.Meanwhile, housing minister Zameer Ahmed indicated that although the decision had been taken, there were numerous capable Kannada actresses who could have been considered.The disagreement even within the ruling establishment reflects the sensitivity of the issue.For pro-Kannada groups, the controversy touches on a larger fear of cultural dilution. They argue that state-owned enterprises should reinforce regional identity rather than dilute it for broader appeal.Beyond the politics, KSDL is attempting a major brand refresh.At the recent relaunch event, the company unveiled 57 products, including new variants of soaps, sandalwood oil, jasmine scented bars, perfumes, toothpaste, coconut oil, petroleum jelly and organic lines. Two coffee table books documenting KSDL’s heritage were also released.The refreshed packaging aims to appeal to younger consumers who are increasingly drawn to premium natural and heritage brands.In recent years, India’s beauty and personal care market has undergone a rapid transformation. Consumers shifted towards global brands and K-beauty trends. However, there has also been a renewed interest in Ayurvedic and traditional formulations.Mysuru Sandal Soap, with its authentic sandalwood oil base, occupies a unique niche. It combines tradition with premium positioning.The launch of KSDL eStore, an e-commerce platform for its products, signals a shift toward digital retail. The company has established stock-keeping units closer to consumers to ensure timely delivery and freshness.In this context, the appointment of a high-profile celebrity ambassador is part of a broader strategy to reposition the brand as aspirational and nationally visible.The row highlights how even consumer goods can become sites of political contestation.In Karnataka, language and regional identity have historically shaped electoral politics. Debates over Hindi imposition, local employment and cultural representation frequently surface in public discourse. Against this backdrop, the choice of a brand ambassador becomes more than a marketing decision.Opposition leaders have framed the issue as evidence of disregard for Kannada pride. Supporters of the government argue that commercial pragmatism should not be conflated with cultural betrayal.The controversy also raises a larger question about public sector branding. Should government-owned companies prioritise regional representation as part of their mandate, or operate strictly on business metrics?For private corporations, such decisions are typically driven by reach, cost and market impact. But when the brand belongs to the state, expectations shift.Tamannaah Bhatia has not publicly commented on the controversy in detail. At the Bengaluru event, she described Mysuru Sandal Soap as deeply associated with emotion and trust. She said she felt privileged to be associated with an institution of such legacy.Her filmography spans multiple industries, and she enjoys a significant social media presence. From a marketing standpoint, that digital footprint is valuable in an era where brand recall is shaped as much by Instagram reels as by television commercials.Yet, the backlash shows that brand endorsement in India cannot be divorced from identity politics.Mysuru Sandal Soap’s enduring appeal lies in its authenticity. Unlike synthetic fragrance soaps, it reportedly uses genuine sandalwood oil, a resource historically associated with Karnataka. The state has long regulated sandalwood harvesting due to its high value and ecological importance.The soap’s emblem, featuring the royal insignia of Mysore, reinforces its historical roots. For many, it represents a time when princely states invested in industrial innovation and self-sufficiency.In that sense, the brand is a bridge between pre-independence industrial vision and modern state enterprise.As of now, the appointment stands. Tamannaah Bhatia’s two-year tenure has begun, and marketing campaigns are underway. KSDL is pushing forward with its expansion plans, eyeing higher turnover, greater exports and a stronger digital footprint.Whether the controversy fades or continues to simmer will depend on political developments and public reception.If the refreshed branding leads to significant growth in north India and overseas markets, the government may point to it as vindication of its strategy. If the backlash persists, opposition parties may continue to frame it as symbolic of deeper cultural concerns.","The controversy intensified after karnataka industries minister mb patil announced that tamannaah bhatia would serve a two-year tenure as brand ambassador for ksdl.

Generative AI ups demand for skilled workers: Study,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/generative-ai-ups-demand-for-skilled-workers-study/articleshow/128368504.cms,"India’s AI Rise Gets Global Push As UN Chief Praises Leadership, Nvidia CEO Predicts Job Surge

NEW DELHI: The introduction of generative AI has resulted in moderation in hiring at the entry level, increased demand for skilled mid-level workers, and provided “considerable stability” at senior level, an ICRIER study has said.“Researchers note this moderation aligns with broader post-pandemic trends in the IT industry and cannot be attributed to AI adoption alone. Roles commonly perceived as most exposed to AI, such as software developers and database administrators, are also among those experiencing the strongest growth in demand, indicating that generative AI is primarily functioning as a productivity-enhancing complement to technical and analytical work, rather than a substitute,” said the report, which was backed by OpenAI and based on a survey of over 650 firms.Roles such as statisticians and mathematicians, application developers and database designers and administrators were among the most exposed — and had the highest demand — while HR, legal and finance professionals were least. The most impacted roles and skills include data entry and clerical work, followed by manual testing, manual quality assurance, and entry level programming.Among business functions in IT companies, software development and engineering, followed by IT infra and cloud services and project management were seen to be the most affected, the survey showed.The report said AI adoption is reshaping hiring priorities toward hybrid skills profiles combining domain expertise and AI and data-related technical skills, instead of narrow specialisation.While half the companies surveyed said they were investing in internal awareness and workforce reskilling, the report said: “The cause for concern, however, is that IT firms are not hiring enough workers with skills in large language model operations or expanding their R&D divisions, and, most importantly, are not investing adequately in training and upskilling. The shortage of qualified AI trainers, limited AI skills among new labour market entrants, and policy and regulatory uncertainty surrounding AI are challenges that must be urgently addressed. ”","The introduction of generative ai has resulted in moderation in hiring at the entry level, increased demand for skilled mid-level workers.

What Sarvam AI has demonstrated - world class AI can be done much more affordably and sustainably with much lower energy and compute footprint - is important.

I have come to believe that in software code generation, much more energy and compute efficient approaches to AI can be developed.

That is important because the earth cannot afford today's AI energy footprint.

Sridhar Vembu has said that artificial intelligence (AI) can be developed in a more affordable and sustainable way, with far lower energy and computing needs than what is commonly used today. In a post shared on X (formerly known as Twitter), Vembu pointed to the work done by Sarvam AI as an example of how high-quality AI systems can be built without heavy reliance on large-scale infrastructure. For those unaware, Sarvam AI is an AI model founded by IIT alumni – Pratyush Kumar and Vivek Raghavan. The Bengaluru-based startup recently claimed that the AI model has outperformed some of the biggest names in artificial intelligence, including Google Gemini and OpenAI’s ChatGPT.In the post, Vembu said Sarvam AI’s work shows that “world-class AI” does not require excessive compute power or energy consumption. He added that this approach is important as concerns grow over the environmental impact of large AI models, which rely on energy-intensive data centres.The Zoho founder also said he believes software code generation, in particular, offers scope for more efficient AI techniques. According to Vembu, new approaches could significantly reduce the energy and compute footprint needed to build and run such systems.Sridhar Vembu further warned that the current trajectory of AI development may not be sustainable in the long run. Vembu said the planet cannot support the rising energy demands of today’s AI models, highlighting the need for alternatives that balance performance with environmental responsibility.His comments come amid broader global debate over the cost, scalability, and environmental impact of advanced AI systems, as companies continue to invest heavily in computing infrastructure to train and deploy large models.","Sridhar vembu said sarvam ai's work shows that ‘world-class ai’ does not require excessive compute power or energy consumption.

Satellite systems bypass these limitations by bringing connectivity directly overhead, often the only viable option where fibre lines can’t reach. With broadband speeds sufficient for video conferencing, real-time collaboration and interactive education platforms, students can participate in live classes, access global resources and engage with educators and peers across borders.

Connectivity alone is not enough. By combining satellite internet with a comprehensive educational platform like The Digital School, the model ensures that teachers are equipped, content is relevant and learning pathways are structured rather than simply providing access without curriculum support.

Challenges in UAE's partnership with Elon Musk's Starlink and the path ahead

While the initiative is promising, several challenges remain in scaling global digital education -

Device Availability: Ensuring that students have the appropriate devices (computers, tablets) to use satellite internet effectively.

Ensuring that students have the appropriate devices (computers, tablets) to use satellite internet effectively. Digital Literacy: Training teachers, learners and communities to make optimal use of digital tools and platforms.

Training teachers, learners and communities to make optimal use of digital tools and platforms. Sustainability: Funding long-term operations, maintenance and support for remote deployments.

However, the UAE’s strategy of combining connectivity infrastructure with education design, teacher training and local partnership frameworks seeks to address these factors holistically. The UAE–Starlink digital education partnership reflects a global vision where access to quality education transcends physical and economic barriers.

By combining one of the world’s most advanced satellite networks with a structured digital learning ecosystem, the initiative pushes toward an inclusive model that could reshape how underserved communities learn, connect and participate in the 21st-century economy. This effort also signals how public-private collaboration in technology and education can unlock new opportunities, aligning with broader global dialogues, such as those at the Future of Education Forum, about the future of learning and the importance of equitable access at scale.

The UAE’s partnership with Starlink to expand digital education worldwide is more than a connectivity project; it is a strategic push to bridge the education divide, empower remote learners and innovate how learning is delivered globally. By leveraging satellite technology and structured digital platforms, the initiative could set a blueprint for the next era of education access.





By partnering with Starlink, the UAE is positioning itself at the forefront of a 21st-century education revolution, championing a model where geography no longer limits a child’s access to learning.Under the initiative, Starlink will provide the underlying satellite broadband connectivity, while The Digital School (a UAE-driven digital learning platform operated under the Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Global Initiatives) will supply structured education, platforms and curriculum support.Already, pilot implementations in Lesotho have seen schools equipped with Starlink terminals alongside digital learning systems, teacher training programmes, and tools for systematic education access. The partnership aligns with broader global efforts to bridge the digital divide in education, an issue highlighted by technology deployments in other countries where Starlink has boosted learning access.For instance:These examples show how satellite internet is increasingly being used to fill connectivity gaps, making online education, from basic courses to advanced collaboration, more widely available. Traditional broadband expansion can be slow and expensive, especially in mountainous, rural or sparsely populated regions.","Uae partners with starlink to expand global digital education access.

In a major step for the UAE’s digital infrastructure ambitions, telecom provider du has announced a strategic partnership to land and invest in the Singapore-India-Gulf (SING) submarine cable system, a next-generation undersea fibre-optic network that will link the Middle East with South Asia and Southeast Asia. The deal reinforces the UAE’s role as a regional data hub and is poised to support future digital growth, artificial intelligence workloads, cloud services and global connectivity.The SING (Singapore-India-Gulf) cable is a planned high-capacity submarine fibre-optic network designed to create a direct east–west digital corridor connecting six strategic landing points:This system is designed to provide high-capacity, low-latency connectivity and strengthen network resilience by diversifying data routes beyond traditional paths such as the Red Sea corridor. It will play a key role in supporting increasing global bandwidth demands driven by cloud computing, streaming, e-commerce and real-time digital services.Under the new partnership, du, one of the UAE’s leading telecom and digital services providers, will host the SING cable at its Kalba cable landing station and also participate financially in its rollout. This means that when completed, the system will have a physical connection to the UAE’s digital ecosystem, allowing faster, more resilient connectivity between the Gulf region and Asia.Karim Benkirane, Chief Commercial Officer at du, said the project will “reinforce the UAE’s role as a global hub for data, cloud and artificial intelligence” by providing the connectivity scale, performance and reliability needed for hyperscalers, tech innovators and enterprise customers.The SING subsea cable is part of a broader renaissance in global submarine infrastructure. Projects like SEA-ME-WE 6, another major submarine cable ongoing between Southeast Asia, the Middle East and Europe, have highlighted the growing need for redundancy, capacity and network reliability. In recent years, disruptions to undersea cables in the Red Sea, a critical data conduit, have shown how vulnerable global internet routes can be to outages, emphasising the need for alternative pathways like SING that can mitigate service impacts if certain routes are compromised.By diversifying connectivity pathways, the UAE and its partners aim to ensure stable data routes that underpin everything from corporate cloud services to consumer streaming and real-time financial systems. The UAE’s investment in SING coincides with global trends in subsea cable deployment. For example, projects like the SEA-ME-WE 6 system, which connects Southeast Asia to Europe with high capacity, are enhancing global data traffic infrastructure and helping meet surging demand.Although the exact ready-for-service date for the SING cable is not yet announced, project progress has accelerated after a major investment by Cerberus Capital Management, which resolved longstanding funding challenges and propelled the system toward execution with planned deployment by 2030. Once operational, the SING network is expected to deliver tens of terabits per second of capacity, providing scalable flexibility for future data needs from businesses, cloud operators, AI research initiatives and cross-continent platforms.Additionally, major alternative cable initiatives such as USTDA-supported efforts for trusted India-to-Southeast Asia routes underline increasing international collaboration on building secure, high-performance subsea networks that serve billions of users worldwide.This positions the UAE and the wider Gulf region at the forefront of next-generation connectivity infrastructure for global scale digital services. As digital economies expand and data traffic grows exponentially, projects like the Singapore-India-Gulf subsea cable system represent critical investments in the future of global connectivity.By partnering with Datawave and investing in the SING cable, du and the UAE are strengthening their role as a strategic gateway between continents, enhancing digital resilience, supporting AI-ready infrastructure and unlocking new opportunities for economic and technological growth.","Du to invest in the subsea fibre optic network that will link six key locations, with landing points in kalba in the uae, muscat in oman, mumbai and chennai in india, kedah in singapore.

UAE's new AI school policy

Using AI during formal examinations or official assessments is completely banned.

Students cannot submit AI-generated assignments, essays, or projects as their own work. Any use of AI must be explicitly disclosed and approved by a teacher beforehand.

Simply rephrasing what a bot says isn't enough. Students must demonstrate a genuine personal understanding of the content. If a student cannot explain the ""why"" behind an AI-assisted answer, it’s a violation.

UAE's strict content controls

Violent or psychologically disturbing imagery.

Hate speech, discrimination, or misinformation.

Promotions of unsafe or illegal behavior, such as cyberbullying or substance abuse.

""Deepfakes"" or any content intended to impersonate others or spread false rumors.

The future





The UAE has officially drawn a line in the digital sand. As artificial intelligence becomes as common as a calculator, the Ministry of Education has released the ""Safe and Responsible Use of Artificial Intelligence in Classrooms 2026"" guide.This comprehensive framework introduces 25 specific prohibitions designed to ensure that while students learn about the future, they don’t lose their ability to think for themselves today.The most significant change is a firm age limit. Students under the age of 13, or those enrolled in any grade below Year 7 (Grade 6), are now strictly prohibited from using generative AI tools like ChatGPT.The Ministry’s reasoning is clear: early education must be built on human interaction, tactile creativity, and independent problem-solving. By keeping AI out of primary classrooms, the government aims to prevent younger learners from developing a ""digital crutch"" before they have mastered the fundamentals of critical thinking and social-emotional skills.For older students who are permitted to use AI, the rules are rigorous. The Ministry has made it clear that AI is a ""tutor,"" not a ""ghostwriter.""The UAE is ensuring that AI tools reflect the country’s unique cultural fabric.The guidelines prohibit creating or sharing any AI content that contradicts Islamic values, national identity, or cultural ethics.Beyond cultural safeguards, the rules ban AI-generated material that includes:In an era of data harvesting, the Ministry has turned schools into a ""data fortress."" There is a total ban on uploading personal information, including names, photos, audio recordings, or ID details, of students, teachers, or parents into any AI platform.Furthermore, schools are prohibited from using unapproved AI services. This means no bypassing school firewalls with VPNs and no creating student accounts on external platforms that require personal data without official Ministry clearance. Even recording or transcribing a classroom discussion using AI now requires the explicit consent of everyone in the room.The ministry’s manual reinforces that AI should function as a support tool, not a shortcut. Students must critically review and verify AI-generated content before using it in their work, ensuring accuracy and relevance. Teachers are expected to guide students on ethical AI practices and help them understand both the capabilities and limitations of generative tools.While these rules seem strict, they aren't about fearing technology, they’re about mastering it. Starting in the 2025-2026 academic year, the UAE is making AI a mandatory subject from Kindergarten to Grade 12.Taught by over 1,000 specially trained educators, this curriculum focuses on the ethics and mechanics of AI. The goal is to graduate a generation that doesn't just know how to prompt a bot, but understands the algorithms, data privacy, and ethical responsibilities that power the modern world.In the UAE, the message is loud and clear: technology will support the teacher, but it will never replace the human mind.","Uae tightens ai rules in schools: ban under 13s, protect academic integrity.

MacKenzie Scott donated $26 billion over the past seven years, including a record $7.2 billion in 2025, a pace of giving that makes her the third-largest philanthropist of all time by total lifetime donations, according to Forbes.Scott is a novelist and the former spouse of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. She has distributed the funds primarily through large, unrestricted grants to non-profit organisations across the United States and internationally. Her total giving since 2019 now stands at $26 billion, according to publicly disclosed figures compiled by philanthropy trackers and financial publications.The $7.2 billion she gave in 2025 marks the largest single-year amount of her philanthropic career. The record year accelerated her overall total and pushed her ahead of most living donors in cumulative lifetime contributions.With $26 billion in lifetime giving, Scott ranks as the third-biggest philanthropist of all time in absolute dollars donated. Only two individuals in modern history have given more in total lifetime contributions.Her 2025 giving alone exceeded the combined lifetime donations of several prominent billionaires, including Tesla and SpaceX chief executive Elon Musk, Google co-founder Larry Page, Oracle co-founder Larry Ellison, and her former husband Jeff Bezos.Scott’s philanthropic strategy has differed from many large-scale donors. Rather than establishing a traditional foundation with extensive application processes, she has relied on advisory teams to identify organisations and has provided grants with few restrictions on how the money must be used. Recipients have included charities focused on education, racial equity, public health, housing, food security and community development.Since announcing her intention in 2019 to give away the majority of her wealth, Scott has moved at an unusually rapid pace compared with other billionaires. The $26 billion total represents one of the fastest large-scale philanthropic distributions in modern history.Most of her wealth comes from her divorce settlement with Jeff Bezos in 2019, when she received a stake in Amazon. She has since sold portions of those shares to fund her charitable donations.The comparison is based on the total amounts Musk, Page, Ellison and Bezos have publicly donated over their lifetimes. Although they have promised large sums and set up charity foundations, the money they have actually given so far is still less than what Scott donated in 2025 alone.Scott has not publicly indicated a fixed end date for her giving.

With more than 1,028 government and semi-government entities and 3,484 private-sector establishments now approved to nominate foreign professionals under Saudi Arabia’s Exceptional Talent Premium Residency, attention is turning to the eligibility standards, particularly the salary requirements.While the expansion broadens access across institutions, the residency itself remains tightly structured around defined income thresholds.The Exceptional Talent product operates under three main tracks, each with its own salary floor.Researchers must earn at least SR14,000 per month, hold a work contract in a priority specialisation, have a minimum of three years of experience, and submit three specialised research papers.Scientific and healthcare professionals face a higher benchmark. They must earn no less than SR35,000 per month, have at least three years of experience in a priority field, and pass an approved points-based evaluation system.At the top end, executive leadership roles are limited to first- and second-tier positions within government or semi-government entities. These roles require a minimum monthly salary of SR80,000.Applicants must also provide an official recommendation letter from their employer.The Exceptional Talent residency is designed to attract highly qualified professionals in scientific, administrative and research fields whose expertise can enhance local capabilities and facilitate knowledge transfer.The Premium Residency Centre states that the initiative supports innovation and institutional development across public-sector entities, while ensuring professional and family stability for eligible residents.The residency is granted for five years and is renewable. Holders may apply for permanent residency after residing in the Kingdom for at least 30 months within five consecutive or non-consecutive years, provided they continue to meet eligibility criteria.Successful applicants receive several advantages. These include exemption from expatriate and dependent fees, self-sponsored exit and re-entry without a visa, access to dedicated lanes for Saudi and GCC citizens at ports of entry, freedom to change employers, property ownership, and the ability to conduct business activities in accordance with the Investment Law.Family members, including parents and children up to the age of 25, are included. Family members may also work in the private sector.The fee for the Exceptional Talent residency product is SR4,000.Although the number of approved entities has expanded significantly, the salary thresholds and qualification standards indicate that the programme remains selective. The framework is tailored to experienced professionals and senior leaders rather than entry-level workers.As Saudi Arabia continues to position itself as a destination for global expertise, the Exceptional Talent residency underscores a clear approach: broaden institutional participation while maintaining high entry standards.","Saudi premium residency requires sr80,000 salary for executive leaders under exceptional talent track.
