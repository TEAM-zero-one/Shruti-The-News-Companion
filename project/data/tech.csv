What does Tata Motors demerger mean for investors?

(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market and other asset classes given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





Tata Motors demerger: Tata Motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on Tuesday, with shares opening at Rs 399 on the Bombay Stock Exchange, compared to Monday's closing price of Rs 660.90. This is a notional decline in Tata Motors' share price post its demerger, according to an ET report.This adjustment occurred as the shares commenced trading ex-demerger value following the division of its commercial vehicles operations into a separate listed company. The reduction corresponds to the commercial vehicle division's removal from the parent company's valuation.October 14 is the record date for the company's division into Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV) and Tata Motors Commercial Vehicles Ltd (TMLCV). Investors holding shares through October 13 will be allocated one TMLCV share for each Tata Motors share owned.The company will adopt the name Tata Motors Passenger Vehicles Ltd (TMPV), comprising passenger vehicles, electric vehicles and Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) units. TMLCV shares will be transferred to demat accounts within 30-45 days, followed by independent listing on the NSE and BSE after securing regulatory clearances.The existing F&O contracts due in October, November and December were concluded on Monday, with new contracts featuring adjusted lot sizes introduced from today.Financial experts anticipate the separation to enhance value assessment and business specialisation.SBI Securities indicates that the division ""enables clearer valuation of the company's distinct businesses."" They forecast TMPV, generating 87% of revenue from JLR, to be valued between Rs 285 and Rs 384 following the split, with growth prospects tied to JLR's operational improvements.For TMLCV, SBI Securities estimates a valuation range of Rs 320-470, highlighting its forthcoming €3.8 billion purchase of Iveco Group NV's commercial vehicle division, which should triple combined turnover and strengthen presence in electric and alternative fuel technologies. ""The integration of Iveco Group NV, most likely in FY27, will expose the company to the global CV cycle,"" they note, whilst cautioning about temporary margin reduction due to Iveco's lower EBIT performance.YES Securities views the separation as a ""value unlocking opportunity,"" observing that standalone passenger and commercial vehicle operations will enable targeted investment in specific automotive sectors.Brokerages say the demerger allows for a clearer valuation of Tata Motors’ separate businesses. “Overall, we expect value creation, as the commercial vehicles (CV) business is likely to trade at around 11 times EV/EBITDA on a FY27 basis, which translates to roughly Rs 300, in line with comparable peers,” said Pankaj Pandey of ICICI Securities, as quoted by Economic Times.“For the passenger vehicles (PV) segment, we estimate a fair value in the range of Rs 450 to 500. Since this is a vertical split, one of the most anticipated demergers, we believe there should be value creation, as the PV and CV businesses are poised for distinct growth trajectories,” Pandey added.According to Bonanza Research Analyst Khushi Mistry, the division ""will lead to sharper business focus for both entities."" TMLCV debuts as India's premier commercial vehicle manufacturer, commanding 37.1% market share and achieving 12.2% EBITDA margin in Q1FY26, despite reduced revenue. TMPV anticipates 8-10% growth in H2FY26, driven by product launches, strong SUV market position, and increasing EV and CNG adoption, representing 45% of its passenger vehicle earnings.Following a September cyberattack, Jaguar Land Rover (JLR), the UK subsidiary of Tata Motors, initiated phased manufacturing operations on October 8. Khushi Mistry reported that wholesale volumes decreased by 24% while retail sales fell 17% in the September quarter, resulting in estimated weekly losses of £50 million. ""Full production is expected to resume post-Christmas due to the scale of restoration needed,"" she stated.YES Securities assessed that ""2QFY26 JLR dispatches (-24% YoY and QoQ) were impacted by production losses due to the cyberattack from early Sep'25. However, the retail-level impact was much lower. We expect volumes to gradually improve in 3Q and 4Q, which should support sentiment.""The share distribution plan allocates one TMLCV share per Tata Motors share owned. Details regarding acquisition costs for both entities will be provided subsequently to facilitate portfolio and tax calculations.Share price fluctuations are anticipated during the structural transition period. Industry analysts indicate that future performance will be determined by JLR's production recovery and TMLCV's operational success following the Iveco integration.The investment community remains focused on whether the corporate separation will boost Tata Motors' share performance or if value enhancement will require a longer timeline.","Tata motors shares dropped by 40% during early trading on tuesday, with shares opening at rs 399 on the bombay stock exchange.

First Tejas-Mk1A from Nashik completes maiden flight; gets water cannon salute — Watch,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/first-tejas-mk1a-from-nashik-completes-maiden-flight-induction-to-take-time/articleshow/124622119.cms,"Tejas-Mk1A

HAL Celebrates Maiden Flight of the First Tejas Mk1A Fighter Jet Manufactured at its Nashik Facility

Tejas-Mk1A fighter aircraft

NASHIK: The first Tejas-Mk1A fighter aircraft produced at defence PSU Hindustan Aeronautics Limited's (HAL) Nashik complex completed its maiden flight here on Friday. The aircraft was rolled out after defence minister Rajnath Singh formally inaugurated the LCA and HTT-40 (trainer aircraft) assembly complexes here.The formal induction of Tejas-Mk1A into the Indian Air Force (IAF), however, will depend on the successful completion of ongoing weapon and radar integration trials.Nashik now hosts the third LCA production line and the second HTT-40 production line. The rollout event, which included a traditional water cannon salute for the Mk1A, comes even as HAL races to meet Tejas-Mk1A delivery timelines for the IAF.The aircraft must clear trials involving the Astra beyond-visual-range air-to-air missile, short-range missiles, and laser-guided bombs.The pre-induction tests will also validate integration with the Israeli-origin ELTA ELM-2052 radar and fire-control system. Earlier tests had encountered software-related snags, prompting modifications before final validation.The Mk1A rollout from Nashik is part of HAL’s broader production ramp-up plan. In addition to its two operational lines in Bengaluru, HAL has established a third line at Nashik, designed to produce up to eight aircraft annually.The PSU has also developed a parallel private-sector supply chain — VEM Technologies (centre fuselage), Alpha (rear fuselage), and L&T (wings) — to support an additional six aircraft each year. Once stabilised, this ecosystem is projected to enable annual production of 30 fighters from 2026-27.HAL is currently grappling with delays in the delivery of 99 GE F404 engines contracted in Aug 2021 for Rs 5,375 crore. Only four engines have been received so far. GE has assured the supply of eight more engines by March 2026 and around 20 engines per year thereafter. Despite the lag, HAL maintains that it has managed to keep production moving by rotating available engines for test flights.The initial order for 83 Tejas Mk1A aircraft, cleared in 2021, was to be delivered between 2024 and 2028. In Aug 2025, the Cabinet Committee on Security approved an additional 97 Mk1A fighters for Rs 66,500 crore, taking the total order to 180 aircraft.Air Chief Marshal AP Singh has repeatedly flagged the urgency of new inductions, saying the IAF is “very badly off in numbers” and needs at least 40 fighters a year to sustain combat readiness. HAL officials have said they are confident of meeting this requirement once the production ecosystem stabilises and integration issues are resolved.Friday's event also saw a formation flying of the Tejas-Mk1A, HTT-40 and Su30-Mki.",The first tejas-mk1a fighter aircraft produced at defence psu hindustan aeronautics limited's (hal) nashik complex completed its maiden flight here on friday.

Taylor Swift’s album release allegedly strains friendship with Ed Sheeran



Donna Kelce’s support comes as Swift balances fame and friendship drama



Donna Kelce, mother of Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce , showed up at Universal Orlando’s Halloween Horror Nights dressed head to toe in Taylor Swift merch. The 73-year-old posted photos on Instagram on Oct. 16, posing with friends in a “1989”-era Taylor Swift hat and shorts from Swift’s latest album, The Life of a Showgirl.“Universal Studios Halloween Horror Nights doesn’t disappoint,” she captioned her post. Fans flooded the comments with messages of support, calling her a “Super mother-in-law” and praising her for her loyalty to Swift.The shorts, featuring images from the singer’s new album, retail for $55 on Swift’s website. Donna Kelce has worn the same hat several times, including at a Kansas City Chiefs game earlier this month, where she paired it with Chiefs earrings and a jersey.Swift and Travis Kelce announced their engagement in August, and Donna has been proudly celebrating their relationship. A People report described her as “very sentimental,” saying she’s saving photos and keepsakes from the couple’s engagement.Travis told GQ that his fiancée and his mom share key qualities. “Their kindness, their genuineness, their ability to say hello to everyone in the room,” he said, crediting Donna’s work ethic as one of the reasons he admires both women.While Donna Kelce continues to support Taylor Swift, the singer’s friendship with Ed Sheeran has reportedly hit a rough patch.According to Daily Mail, Sheeran was “peeved” after Swift released The Life of a Showgirl just three weeks after his album Play. A music insider told the outlet, “Ed takes these things really seriously and carefully plans his album releases. He announced his album with four months’ notice, but then Taylor announced hers for just two weeks after. He was very much put out and understandably peeved.”The source added that it’s “not the first time Taylor has done something like this” and claimed that the move has “strained” their longtime friendship.Even though Play debuted at No. 1, it quickly fell out of the Top 10 when Swift’s record dropped. The overlap reportedly left Sheeran’s team rushing to promote his album before Swift’s overshadowed it.The pair have been close since 2012, collaborating on “Everything Has Changed” from Swift’s Red album. Swift has called Sheeran her “second brother” in past interviews, but their relationship appears to have cooled in recent months.During her Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon appearance on Oct. 10, Swift laughed off rumors of bad blood, saying Sheeran doesn’t even own a phone. “He doesn’t have a phone. When the news came out, I was like, ‘Oh my God, we forgot to call Ed!’ He’s like family. I love him,” she said.Between her engagement to Travis Kelce and ongoing friendship rumors, Taylor Swift continues to dominate headlines.Donna Kelce’s open admiration for her future daughter-in-law shows how close the families have become, even as Swift’s inner circle faces speculation about fractured friendships.Neither Swift nor Sheeran have commented further on the reported tension, but Swift’s recent appearances and family ties suggest she’s focusing on what matters most.","Donna kelce showed up at universal orlando’s halloween horror nights dressed head to toe in taylor swift merch.

Fans speculate as Tom Brady hints at “another roast” moment

Could Tom Brady be pulling a LeBron James-style business reveal ?

NFL icon Tom Brady is back in the spotlight, not for a comeback, but for a cryptic teaser that has his fans, followers, and even sports insiders buzzing. On Friday morning, the seven-time Super Bowl champion posted an Instagram video that immediately set off speculation about what’s coming on October 21.In the video, Brady referenced his viral Netflix roast from May 2024, a comedic spectacle that featured everyone from former teammates to Hollywood celebrities poking fun at his storied career and personal life. At the time, Brady admitted he had some regrets, particularly because his family was uncomfortable with certain jokes.But now, the retired quarterback seems to be leaning back into that energy. “You know what, I think I’m ready for another roast,” Brady said with a smirk. “I think I can handle it… you don’t think I can?”Fans instantly flooded the comments with guesses. “Didn’t he say the roast was one of the things he most regretted doing?” one user pointed out, while another joked, “No shot, prob promoting a new grille company or cooking show.” Some even took the word roast literally, suggesting Brady might be teasing a food-related venture: “My money is it has something to do with roasted meats lol.”Many believe Brady’s announcement could mirror LeBron James’ “Second Decision”, which recently turned out to be a marketing ploy for a business deal rather than a career move. With Brady’s growing list of ventures, from his TB12 brand to BRADY clothing and his minority ownership stake in the Las Vegas Raiders, fans suspect the same playbook might be in motion.Whether it’s another self-deprecating comedy special or a clever branding move, one thing is certain: Brady knows how to stir curiosity. Since retiring in 2022, the Fox Sports analyst has mastered the art of keeping his name trending without stepping back on the field.Also Read: “True diva”: Gisele Bündchen’s latest workout selfie sparks fan frenzy and fuels admiration for her post-Tom Brady glow-up Whatever he’s teasing for October 21, the football legend has once again proven that even in retirement, Tom Brady never loses his ability to command the spotlight.","Nfl icon tom brady has sparked fan speculation with a cryptic instagram teaser hinting at ""another roast"" on october 21.

chasing a target”

“The (second) question is with the release of 1% workforce, the headcount declined by 20,000 people or 3%. And what you had announced earlier was 2%. So should we expect a similar kind of head count reduction in the next quarter as well?”

“So almost -- see, the 20,000 head count is a factor of voluntary and involuntary attrition.

So you should see that. But as we announced, against the 2 percentage, we have midway, so we have done approximately 1 percentage of it. And like what Krithi just mentioned, we don't have a target.”

“We are not chasing a target. We'll continue to evaluate everyone after all the investment in learning and development that we've done…..” he continued.





Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) HR head Sudeep Kunnumal recently addressed concerns over potential layoffs at the IT giant. Speaking during the company’s Q2 earnings call earlier this month, Kunnumal said that TCS is notwhen it comes to job cuts. Instead, the IT firm said it will evaluate “everyone”.During the earnings call, analyst Surendra Goyal from Citi asked:TCS HR head Sudeep Kunnumal replied to the question saying:Goyal further asked: “So just to clarify, there will be no involuntary attrition beyond the 1% number, is that understanding correct?”To this, Sudeep Kunnumal replied: “No, no, I didn't say that.See, we estimate it to be 2%. We are currently at 1%, and we will continue to evaluate people whom we can redeploy -- whom we are not redeploy, and those are the people that we will release.”During the earnings call, TCS HR chief also talked about the new H-1B visa rule announced by Trump administration last month. Kunnumal said “...on H1B, we have significantly localized our workforce in the U.S. approximately just about 500 associates have traveled to the U.S. on H1B. We believe our business model will be able to adapt quickly to any changes in immigration policy.” US announced an annual fee of $100,000 on H-1B visa applications from September 21 onwards.Separately, the company has also announced a wage hike for over 80 percentage of our workforce with the effect from September 1.","Tata consultancy services (tcs) hr head sudeep kunnumal recently addressed concerns over potential layoffs at the it giant.

AI’s real value lies ahead







Zoho founder Sridhar Vembu is the next to join the ongoing ‘AI bubble’ debate. Vembu has issued a cautionary warning on the present surge in artificial intelligence investments. He described the market as a ‘financial bubble’ that could distort long-term innovation. In an interview with CNBC-TV18, Vembu said that while AI holds enormous promise, the present wave of huge valuations and funding practices are becoming a cause on concern. “This boom makes me very uncomfortable,” he said. “While AI as a technology has enormous promise, much of today’s investment is speculative.”Along with this, Vembu also pointed to a round-tripping which a financial manoeuvre where companies fund each other to inflate revenue. This practice as per Vembu is a troubling trend for the AI sector. He further warned that such practices could lead to unsustainable valuations which is smilier to the past bubbles in dotcom and e-commerce. “Some people argue the multi-trillion-dollar valuations will be justified by productivity gains. But why aren’t those gains visible already?” he asked.However, despite all these concerns, Vembu stressed on the fact that the underlying technology of AI remains valuable and will continue to deliver real benefits in the long term.He advocates for measured, purpose-driven investment rather than hype-fueled speculation. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos may have agreed with Sam Altman over ‘AI Bubble’ warningRecently, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos also pointed out that the current surge of investment in artificial intelligence (AI) constitutes an “industrial bubble” but stressed that the underlying technology is ""real"" and will bring immense societal benefits. Similar comments have been previously made by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman who reportedly said earlier this year that he believes AI could be in a bubble but it’s “the most important thing to happen in a very long time”.“This is a kind of industrial bubble,” the Amazon founder said while speaking at Italian Tech Week.“The second thing that happens is that people get very excited like they are today about artificial intelligence,” Bezos added, noting that when they happen, stock prices are “disconnected from the fundamentals” of a business. He said that during bubbles, every experiment or idea gets funded.“The good ideas and the bad ideas. And investors have a hard time in the middle of this excitement, distinguishing between the good ideas and the bad ideas. And that’s also probably happening today,” Bezos said.","Zoho founder sridhar vembu has issued a cautionary warning on the present surge in artificial intelligence investments.

Sony PlayStation Network experienced a temporary outage earlier today, affecting thousands of users across the United States. Reports on DownDetector, a platform that tracks online service disruptions, indicated that over 11,000 users faced issues, primarily related to server connectivity. Users in the United States received ‘service busy’ message while accessing the platform. Problems were also detected with logging in and in carrying out PNS-related social media activities.Now, according to PlayStation Network Service Status, all services have now been restored. “All services are up and running,” the status page reads, including account management, gaming and social and PlayStation Store.As of now, there is no official statement from Sony about what caused the outage.The outage, which lasted for roughly an hour, impacted users in major cities including New York, Chicago, Washington, Atlanta, and Tampa. Many players reported problems logging in and using PlayStation Network’s social features during the downtime.Expressing frustration, one user wrote in the comment section of Downdetector: “Is it even worth it?

Goldman Sachs chief information officer (CIO) Marco Argenti believes professionals can succeed in the AI-driven workplace by focusing on collaboration and questioning rather than competing with machines. In a recent company Briefings newsletter (as seen by Fortune), Argenti outlined four strategies on how employees canas autonomous systems take on tasks previously reserved for humans. Argenti's advice centres on adapting to the AI transition by learning how to conduct, question, and collaborate with the new technology. This approach is intended to help professionals thrive as AI reshapes workplaces globally. In the newsletter, Argenti wrote:Argenti suggests that today’s professionals need to shift from simply executing tasks to coordinating them. Success, he explains, will depend less on individual output, such as writing code or performing analysis and more on managing agile teams composed of both human and AI contributors. Effective leadership will involve delegating, coordinating, and integrating their work to achieve outcomes that neither could reach alone.According to Argenti, curiosity is one of the most valuable human abilities in an AI-driven world. He encourages employees toWhile AI systems are strong at processing existing information, they rely on human curiosity to spark new ideas. By asking imaginative, unconventional questions, people can help AI move beyond familiar patterns and reveal deeper insights.Argenti wrote.Argenti also recommends that professionals use a mix of AI tools tailored to specific tasks rather than relying on a single platform. No one model performs best in every situation, he notes. The advantage lies in understanding which tools are most effective for particular purposes, such as data analysis, writing, or coding and combining them into a personalised digital toolkit.Argenti further warns that even advanced AI systems can generateAs these tools become more integrated into work processes, checking their accuracy will require domain expertise and careful evaluation.he writes, will help distinguish reliable insights from misleading ones.Argenti concludes that AI is not replacing human ability but changing how it is defined.

How Google AI is decoding cancer through cellular language



Discovery of a potential cancer therapy pathway



Transforming scientific discovery



Open access for global collaboration





In a significant development for AI in biomedical research, Google ’s C2S-Scale 27B foundation model, developed in collaboration with Yale University and based on the Gemma framework, has successfully generated a novel hypothesis about cancer cell behaviour. This hypothesis was later experimentally validated in living human cells, marking an important step forward in the integration of artificial intelligence with laboratory science.Google CEO Sundar Pichai hailed the development as a major advance in the partnership between AI and laboratory science. He emphasised that the discovery could guide future preclinical and clinical research, potentially revealing new pathways for cancer therapy.At the core of this achievement is the C2S-Scale 27B model’s exceptional capacity to ""understand"" biology. The AI system was trained on over one billion single-cell profiles and transforms raw molecular data into what researchers call “cell sentences.” With this approach, the AI can interpret cellular communication and context, essentially learning the “language” of cells.As biotech entrepreneur Bryan Johnson explained, the model “listened” to what cells were signalling and produced a hypothesis that real biological experiments later confirmed.This fluency in cellular patterns marks a turning point for AI’s role in biomedical discovery, enabling it to reason about complex systems and propose new ideas rather than simply summarising existing knowledge.The C2S-Scale 27B model produced a hypothesis suggesting that the drug silmitasertib could significantly boost antigen presentation in cancer cells by almost 50% under conditions of low interferon. Antigen presentation is the process by which tumour cells display fragments of abnormal proteins on their surface, signalling the immune system to recognise and attack them. By enhancing this mechanism, silmitasertib could make previously “invisible” tumours detectable to immune cells, strengthening the body’s own ability to fight cancer.Experiments conducted in human cell models confirmed the AI’s prediction. This finding is particularly promising for tackling “cold tumours,” a type of cancer known for bypassing immune detection and resisting conventional therapies. If these results are validated in further preclinical and clinical studies, they could open the door to new immunotherapy approaches, offering fresh hope for patients with cancers that are notoriously difficult to treat.This milestone represents a turning point in how AI can contribute to medical research. Rather than merely analysing existing datasets, AI systems like C2S-Scale 27B are now capable of generating entirely new scientific hypotheses, bridging the gap between computational prediction and experimental validation. Researchers emphasise that extensive preclinical and clinical testing is still essential before these AI-driven insights can translate into viable treatments for patients.Even so, this achievement demonstrates the transformative potential of AI as a true partner in science, capable of accelerating discovery, sparking innovation, and guiding research in ways that were previously unimaginable.In an effort to democratise cutting-edge biomedical research, Google has made the C2S-Scale model publicly available on platforms such as Hugging Face and GitHub. This transparency allows scientists worldwide to explore the model’s capabilities, test its predictions, and build upon its foundation.","Google’s c2s-scale 27b foundation model has successfully generated a novel hypothesis about cancer cell behaviour.

ChatGPT sees fall in app downloads and time spent on the mobile app





ChatGPT’s mobile app may be losing steam, with new data from app intelligence firm Apptopia showing a slowdown in global download growth. According to the analysis, the app’s new user growth, measured by month-over-month percentage changes in global downloads, has been decelerating since April and is projected to decline by 8.1% in October.While ChatGPT continues to attract millions of daily downloads worldwide, the stalling growth rate signals a potential peak in its expansion. Apptopia’s data also reveals a leveling off in global daily active users (DAUs) over the past month, suggesting the app’s user base is stabilizing.Apptopia in its report attributes the slowdown to rising competition and changes to ChatGPT’s AI model, which may be impacting its appeal. Apptopia notes that ChatGPT’s average time spent per DAU and average sessions per DAU metrics were trending downward before the sharp rise of its competitor, Google’s Gemini, which shot up to the top charts in September thanks to the release of Google’s new AI image model, Nano Banana. However, the company noted that while Gemini’s growth may have impacted some of the more recent drops in ChatGPT’s core metrics, it doesn’t explain the overall trend completely.In the U.S., user engagement is declining. The average time spent per DAU has dropped 22.5% since July, and the number of sessions per DAU has fallen by 20.7%. This indicates that American users are spending less time in the app and opening it less frequently.However, user churn has stabilized, with fewer users experimenting briefly and then abandoning the app, pointing to stronger retention of its core audience.As the AI landscape evolves, ChatGPT’s mobile app faces new challenges in maintaining its growth trajectory.",Chatgpt sees fall in app downloads and time spent on the mobile app. App intelligence firm apptopia attributes the slowdown to rising competition and changes to chatgpt’s ai model.

Meta has launched a new AI-powered feature for Facebook , allowing its AI to suggest creative edits for unposted photos in users’ camera rolls. The feature, now available to all users in the US and Canada, was announced on Friday and offers opt-in sharing suggestions for posting AI-edited photos to Facebook Feeds and Stories. ""We’re introducing a new Facebook feature that surfaces photos and videos and suggests fun edits and collages, making it easier to share your favorite moments,"" said the company in a post.Initially tested in June, the feature prompts users with a permission dialog to allow cloud processing of camera roll images. This enables Meta AI to generate creative ideas like collages, recaps, AI restyling, and birthday-themed edits. Users can disable the feature at any time.Meta emphasizes that unposted photos are not used to train its AI or for ad targeting unless users actively edit or share the media. However, agreeing to Meta’s AI Terms of Service permits the AI to analyze media and facial features to summarize content, modify images, or generate new content. ""All suggestions are private to you and you decide what to share, when to share, and with whom.We don’t use media from your camera roll to improve AI at Meta, unless you choose to edit this media with our AI tools, or share,"" said Meta in its post.The company also uses photo metadata, such as dates and the presence of people or objects, to tailor suggestions, raising concerns about the depth of personal data accessed.This rollout follows earlier reports in June about a test phase, where Meta clarified it wasn’t using private photos for AI training but left open the possibility for future use under specific conditions.

Why UK government launched this plan



What is the use of ID?



How Veteran can use access digital IDs?



Is it similar to India?







The UK government launched the digital version of its ID scheme on Friday, intended for former members of the armed services.This ID will mean passports, driving licenses, national insurance cards, and many more being virtual, instead of—or as well as—being stored in a shoebox or under socks in a drawer, Sky News reported.The UK government has announced the introduction of digital IDs aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.The govt claims the initiative is designed to reduce illegal immigration by making it more difficult for those without status to secure employment.Ministers contend that the ability to obtain jobs is a primary attraction for migrants entering the UK unlawfully. Under the new system, employers will no longer be able to depend on National Insurance numbers—which currently serve as part of proof of the right to work—or on paper-based verification methods, BBC reported.""At the moment, it is quite easy to borrow, steal or use someone else's National Insurance number and that is part of the problem in the shadow economy—people sharing National Insurance numbers for example. The idea is that having a picture attached would make it—in theory—harder to abuse that system,"" a government spokesperson explained.The digital IDs, which will be app-based and stored on smartphones akin to the NHS App or digital bank cards, will contain information such as the holder's residency status, name, date of birth, nationality, and a photograph.Sir Keir, when announcing the scheme, stated: ""You will not be able to work in the United Kingdom if you do not have digital ID. It's as simple as that.""From today, Friday 17 October, it will give ex-soldiers a seamless way to confirm their status in person and will include information already featured on their physical card with the security features that protect their personal information.Ministers hope the digital veteran card will show how the technology works and quash public concerns about privacy and security.Veterans will now be able to hold their credentials in a smartphone app called Gov.uk One Login. The govt had previously announced that digital credentials, including the veteran card, would be stored in an app named Gov.uk Wallet. It now states it will “transition to talking about [One Login] as the Gov.uk Wallet” as more govt-issued credentials become available digitally. The credential will be stored under encryption in the app, similar to how a train or concert ticket is held in an Apple or Google wallet, The Guardian reported.Verification using face ID or a fingerprint will be required to access it, and the govt claims it is safer than physical IDs. Another version of the credential will be held by the Ministry of Defence, and as more IDs are added, the information will remain with each issuer and in the citizens’ app, ensuring there is no central database of all ID data, thereby avoiding what some have feared could be a “honeypot for hackers”.India has well established digital ID system. India’s digital ID system, Aadhaar, is significantly larger and more detailed than the UK’s planned system.New Delhi stores citizens’ fingerprints, eye scans, photos, home addresses and phone numbers, with the system processing approximately 80 million authentications daily.Under Aadhaar, every Indian citizen receives a 12-digit number intended to replace numerous paper documents. All adults and children over the age of five must provide biometric information. The system verifies identities for activities such as opening bank accounts or applying for new SIM cards. It also aimed to streamline the disbursement of govt benefits, providing holders with instant proof of identity and access to basic services.Aadhaar and UK's digital ID seems to be same.India also have other apps like DigiLocker, where you can store all the important documents like Aadhar Card, Pan card, driving license digitally at one place, Digi Yatra and many more.The UK's digital ID seems to be following the similar model of India. Like DigiLocker, UK is introducing Gov.UK Wallet. Few days ago, UK PM Keir Starmer made his first trip to India and hailed India’s ID system as a “massive success”.During his trade-centric visit to Mumbai, Starmer also met with Nandan Nilekani, co-founder and chair of Indian tech services group Infosys, who led the govt body responsible for delivering the ID database more than a decade ago.",The uk government has announced the introduction of digital ids aimed at verifying individuals' rights to live and work in the country.

Car crash sparks concern



Shares fall







A fatal crash involving a Xiaomi Corp. SU7 electric sedan on Monday has renewed concerns over electrically powered car-door handles, after bystanders were unable to open the doors and rescue the driver before it burst into flames.The incident, which occurred in the southwestern Chinese city of Chengdu, was suspected to have been caused by drunk driving and killed the motorist, police said in a statement, as per Boomerang.Although authorities did not specify the vehicle model, Chinese media reports and videos on platforms like Weibo suggest it was a Xiaomi SU7.Video and eyewitness accounts showed bystanders trying but failing to open the doors of the burning car to rescue an occupant. Personnel at the scene eventually used a fire extinguisher to put out the blaze, local reports said.It seems that the electronic has killed the driver as the bystanders couldn't open the doors because it was jammed after the crash and maybe the situation would be different if it was the manual car.A fatal SU7 crash earlier this year raised concerns about the vehicle’s smart driving features and caused Xiaomi’s shares to tumble.The incident could also intensify scrutiny on electronic door handles, a design popularised by Tesla and now common in modern EVs.Unlike mechanical models, electronic door handles rely on sensors and electricity and may fail during a fire or power outage. China is considering a ban on such electric door handles to address safety risks linked to the feature, state-backed media reported in late September.Chinese tech giant Xiaomi saw its shares fall by over 5% on Monday, following reports that the doors of one of its electric vehicles failed to open after a fiery crash in China that left one person dead, NBC reported.The stock slid as much as 8.7% in Hong Kong, marking its steepest drop since April, before paring losses after images and video of a burning Xiaomi SU7 sedan in Chengdu circulated on Chinese social media.","Chinese tech giant xiaomi saw its shares fall by over 5% on monday, following reports that the doors of one of its electric vehicles failed to open after a fiery crash in china.
