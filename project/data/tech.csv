NEW DELHI: India today faces a fundamentally different set of security challenges, driven by rapid technological disruption that is reshaping the nature of warfare, Chief of Defence Staff Gen Anil Chauhan said Friday as he linked complex threats to the rise of AI, cyber capabilities, big data and private technology companies. ""Technology today is defining strategy and war-winning strategy,"" Gen Chauhan said during his lecture at Jawaharlal Nehru University on Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's birth anniversary, adding nations were fighting informal, proxy and hybrid wars rather than declared conflicts.The world is witnessing not incremental change but what Gen Chauhan described as ""great disruption"" - geopolitical, geo-economic and technological - with profound implications for the military. He referred to Operation Sindoor, noting modern military operations increasingly relied on precision, speed and multi-domain integration rather than geography alone. ""There was a time when geography defined strategy. Today, technology defines strategy.""He also warned of ""cognitive colonialism"", with societies influenced and destabilised through information operations, narrative manipulation and psychological warfare enabled by AI, machine learning and data mining.""Traditional colonialism was led by trading companies. New colonialism (is) by multinational corporations. Cognitive colonialism will be ushered in by large IT and data mining companies,"" he said, cautioning such disruptions could engineer social disorder without a single shot being fired.Linking these challenges to Bose's legacy, Chauhan said India was dismantling colonial mindsets and building a unified national identity rooted in strategic autonomy. He stressed on self-reliance, military preparedness, anticipation of threats and societal resilience being essential to preserve India's sovereignty in an era where ""might is right"" and ""rules-based global order is under strain"".","India today faces a fundamentally different set of security challenges, says chief of defence staff.

ECINET to integrate 40+ poll apps: India invites world EMBs to collaborate,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ecinet-to-integrate-40-poll-apps-india-invites-world-embs-to-collaborate/articleshow/127262009.cms,"NEW DELHI: The Election Commission on Thursday formally launched ECINET — a single digital platform that onboards over 40 different election-related applications and portals — at the ongoing India International Conference on Democracy and Election Management (IICDEM) here, with chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar offering EC's collaboration to other election management bodies (EMBs) for developing similar platforms for their respective countries.Addressing delegates from around 42 EMBs at the launch of ECINET — which subsumes IT innovations by EC over a protracted timeline of eight years, is as per the election laws and offered in 22 Indian languages and English — Kumar proposed that the EC team behind ECINET can work with the representatives of other EMBs to evolve a similar platform aligned with their laws and in their own language. ""I would request the EMBs to examine this, and if you so request, EC will be more than willing to work with you on this score,"" he said.During bilateral meetings between EC and heads of 32 EMBs — from countries like the US, UK, South Africa, Portugal, Peru, The Philippines and Sri Lanka, etc. — on Thursday, the latter evinced interest in the collaboration offer. India also offered to provide training support to the officials of foreign EMBs through the India International Institute of Democracy and Election Management (IIIDEM).ECINET was envisaged as a one-stop digital platform by Kumar, along with election commissioners S S Sandhu and Vivek Joshi, and its development was announced in May 2025.It onboards more separate EC apps meant to connect citizens, candidates, political parties, election officials, and extend key services like voter registration, electoral roll search, 'track your application', 'know your candidate, 'connect with election officials', 'book-a-call with the BLO', e-EPIC download, near-realtime polling trends, grievance redressal, amongst others.""I formally launch ECINET for the world for better elections... and for a much more transparent and efficient sharing of information with billions of users at all points in time,"" Kumar said at the event.The beta version of ECINET was successfully piloted during the 2025 Bihar assembly elections and the preceding special intensive revision (SIR), enabling EC to deliver enhanced citizen-centric electoral services and make available all election-related information at the click of a button. Suggestions were sought from citizens before giving final shape to the platform. Kumar on Thursday shared that nearly 53,000 suggestions were received and the app was constantly updated, sometimes by the hour. He even reached out to the EMBs of the world to examine the app and offer their suggestions to improve it further.Since the beta release, ECINET has processed over 10 crore registration forms, averaging 2.7 lakh forms per day. More than 11 lakh booth-level officers (BLOs) have registered on the platform. Over 150 crore documents have been digitised through this platform to date.Earlier, election commissioner Sandhu said that ECINET is a great tool to enhance trust in EMBs as it brings in greater transparency and provides for quick decision-making and information dissemination. Fellow commissioner Vivek Joshi said IICEDM 2026 will allow EMBs to draw from global practices on the adoption of technology and digital innovations.DG (Information Technology) in EC, Dr Seema Khanna, underlined that cybersecurity is one of the key pillars of ECINET. She said ECINET enhances transparency, efficiency, credibility, and public trust in elections.",Ecinet is a single digital platform that onboards over 40 different election-related applications and portals.

Planning a bank visit? You might want to reschedule, as banks are set for a four-day holiday, beginning from January 23 till January 26. Keeping track of bank holidays is crucial for customers to plan their finances in advance and avoid last-minute inconvenience.It is important to note that banks in India follow a combination of national and state-specific holidays, which means branch closures may vary from one state to another. Here's a list of when and where will banks remain closed for rest of January:Banks will remain shut in Tripura, Odisha and West Bengal on account of the Birthday of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose, Saraswati Puja (Shree Panchami), Vir Surendrasai Jayanti and Basanta Panchami.Banks will remain closed as it is the fourth Saturday of the month. According to RBI, banks remain closed on second and fourth Saturdays of the month.Banks will remain sut nationwide, as it is a Sunday.Banks across the country will remain closed, to mark Republic Day While bank branches will not be operational on these days, customers will still be able to access a range of digital banking services.Online banking platforms, ATMs, mobile banking applications and UPI services will continue to function, allowing users to carry out fund transfers, bill payments and other routine transactions.However, services that require a physical visit to a bank branch, including large cash deposits, cheque clearances and the issuance of demand drafts, will not be available during the holidays. Account holders are therefore advised to complete such tasks in advance and rely on digital options when branches are shut.","Banks will remain shut in tripura, odisha and west bengal on account of the birthday of netaji subhas chandra bose, saraswati puja (shree panchami) according to rbi, banks remain closed on second and fourth saturdays of the month.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127237109,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-1545779,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Why Jarren Duran makes sense for the Philadelphia Phillies

An outfield full of overlap, not production

Right now, the outfield looks like this:

What Jarren Duran actually brings

A trade idea gaining attention

Why it works for Philadelphia Phillies

Why Boston would consider it

What this means for Nick Castellanos

Risk and reward

Philadelphia Phillies trade talk is heating up, and one name keeps coming up: Boston Red Sox outfielder Jarren Duran. Around the league, insiders see him as a real option for Philadelphia as the team looks ahead to 2026. With the Phillies stuck with an expensive, underperforming outfield and Boston juggling young talent and payroll flexibility, a Duran deal is starting to feel realistic rather than speculative.The logic is straightforward. Philadelphia needs speed, defense, and consistency in the outfield right now. Boston can afford to move from a position of strength without stepping away from contention. A deal built around Duran could change the direction of both teams going into next season.The Philadelphia Phillies’ outfield problems are no longer minor.Nick Castellanos struggled badly in 2025, and both Max Kepler and Harrison Bader could be gone soon. Brandon Marsh, Johan Rojas, and Weston Wilson are useful players, but none of them provide steady offense. Justin Crawford is a promising prospect, but he is not ready to carry a contender.Duran gives Philadelphia something it doesn’t really have right now. He can run, he drives the ball into the gaps, and he holds his own defensively. Just as important, he’s under team control through 2028, which helps a team that wants to compete now without taking on long-term baggage. At 29 in 2026, he fits the Phillies’ current window, not a distant rebuild.Philadelphia Phillies’ roster has become crowded without delivering results. Castellanos is owed $20 million in 2026 and was already being platooned late last season. Kepler and Bader may be short-term fixes at best. Internally, most options lean heavily toward defense, not run production.- Nick Castellanos: declining bat, poor defense, expensive contract- Brandon Marsh: strong glove, streaky offense- Johan Rojas: elite defense, limited hitting- Weston Wilson: depth option- Justin Crawford: high ceiling, not ready yetThat mix makes it clear why the front office is looking outside the organization.Jarren Duran’s value is not just about one standout season. Even in 2025, which was quieter than his 2024 breakout, he played nearly every day and produced across the board.In 2025, he hit .256/.332/.442 with 41 doubles, 13 triples, 16 home runs, 84 RBI, and 24 stolen bases. He finished with a 4.7 bWAR and continued to show hard contact and range in the outfield. His 2024 season proved his upside, but 2025 showed his floor is still that of a strong everyday player.Compared to Castellanos, the gap is obvious. Duran gets on base more, runs better, and helps defensively. Castellanos offers limited power and little else at this stage.One proposal making the rounds looks like this:- Phillies receive: Jarren Duran- Red Sox receive: Alec Bohm, Johan Rojas or Brandon Marsh, and pitching prospect Jean CabreraFor Boston, this means moving Duran’s arbitration salary while filling needs at third base, outfield depth, and pitching. For Philadelphia, it means giving up Bohm and some depth to fix their biggest roster problem.From the Philadelphia Phillies’ side, the appeal is clear. They get an everyday outfielder who improves the lineup and defense without stripping the farm system.The upside includes better balance in the lineup, more speed on the bases, improved outfield range, and less dependence on aging veterans. Duran hitting near Trea Turner and Kyle Schwarber could add pressure on opposing pitchers every night.Boston is not looking to tear things down. Their outfield pipeline is strong, with Roman Anthony and Wilyer Abreu pushing for bigger roles. Third base is less settled, especially with Alex Bregman approaching free agency.Adding Bohm gives them a reliable bat at a position of need. Rojas or Marsh adds flexibility, and Cabrera helps the pitching depth. The move clears salary without signaling a rebuild.If Jarren Duran arrives, Castellanos’ time in Philadelphia Phillies likely ends. The Phillies could try to trade him while covering part of his salary, release him, or attempt one last positional shuffle. Moving on would free money for bullpen help or future upgrades.There are risks. Duran’s dip in 2025 could continue. Bohm’s bat would be missed at third base. Boston would be betting on depth rather than holding onto a proven everyday player.The rewards, though, are significant. Philadelphia would likely get the best player in the deal and directly fix its weakest area. Boston reshapes its roster without sacrificing competitiveness.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Atlanta Braves weighing blockbuster move for Texas Rangers’ $186 million shortstop ahead of deadline On paper, the Philadelphia Phillies come out ahead. They address a clear need with a controllable, well-rounded player and stay firmly in the National League race. If this trade happens, it will be one of the more important moves heading into the 2026 season, driven not by flash, but by a simple need for better balance and production.","Philadelphia phillies’ outfield problems are no longer minor. Nick castellanos struggled badly in 2025, and both max kepler and harrison bader could be gone soon. Brandon marsh, johan rojas, and weston wilson are useful players, but none of them provide steady offense.

Taylor Swift is reportedly working on an interesting project based on her relationship with Travis Kelce

Will Travis Kelce retire before he marries Taylor Swift?

Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s romance has inspired billions around the world with the love, respect and commitment they have shown towards each other.While there have been reports that their high profile wedding might have been delayed, it seems Taylor Swift is already working on a new thing. To make it more interesting, her new project will be heavily inspired by her relationship with Travis Kelce.A few weeks ago, as per Radar Online, a source revealed that Taylor Swift is writing a film whose screenplay will be based on her relationship with Travis Kelce. It is said to be a modern take on Romeo and Juliet.ID@undefinedCaption not available.The source said, ""Taylor never switches off creatively – she's constantly dreaming up new ideas. Her relationship with Travis has fueled a lot of her recent work, but what fans have seen so far is only a fraction of it.”The source added, “Not many people realize she's been quietly writing short stories and screenplays, and one of them is inspired by their relationship.""As per Radar Online, a second source added, ""Taylor's talked about using Baz Luhrmann's Romeo & Juliet as her creative guide. The script will take plenty of cues from her relationship with Travis – it won't be a biopic, but her real life will definitely shape it.”The source continued, “It's the egotistical project to end all egotistical projects, and critics will call her out on that, saying it is as self-obsessed as her famous break-up songs about her exes.""However, neither Taylor Swift nor Travis Kelce has confirmed the speculations on the billionaire pop star’s new project yet as they continue to remain silent about their lives.It has been a few months since Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce announced their engagement in August 2025.Though fans were expecting the two to tie the knot this summer, it seems their wedding will be delayed, owing to the retirement speculations surrounding Travis Kelce.After a pretty poor season on the field, many fans believe Travis Kelce will be announcing his retirement soon, ahead of the new season.",Taylor swift reportedly turning her romance with travis kelce into a new project.

“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work”

Who was Thomas Alva Edison



What this Thomas Edison quote means



“Opportunity is missed by most people because it is dressed in overalls and looks like work.”

Why this quote still matters



How people relate to it today







People remember Thomas A. Edison as one of the most important inventors. He worked on a lot of ideas and had thousands of patents over the course of his life. Many of his inventions are now a part of daily life, like the electric light bulb and sound recording devices. But Edison was known for more than just what he made. People also knew how he thought about work, hard work, and success., is one of the most popular things he has said. Edison talks about a simple habit that a lot of people have. People often look for opportunities in things that seem fun, easy, or rewarding right away. It's easier to ignore something when it looks hard or requires a lot of work. Edison thought this was where a lot of people went wrong. He says that opportunities don't usually come in a polished or attractive way. Instead, it often comes in a quiet way that looks like work that needs to be done.Thomas Alva Edison was born in 1847 in the US. He was curious about how things worked from a young age. As he got older, this curiosity turned into a habit of trying new things and making old ones better. Edison worked on many projects at once and thought that progress came from working hard over and over again instead of getting quick results.Some of the most important things he invented were the electric light bulb, phonograph, and the motion picture camera. He also built labs where groups of people could work together on long-term experiments. Edison thought that being patient, testing things out, and working hard every day were all important parts of coming up with new ideas. A lot of historical records say that he saw innovation as a normal part of his job, not a flash of genius.Edison said,He was using a simple picture to explain a common reaction. Overalls are clothes that people wear to do physical or practical work. Edison used this picture to show that opportunities often seem normal and hard to get.A lot of people think that success will come quickly or with little work. They might want results right away, without having to learn, practice, or fail along the way. Edison said that real opportunities usually require work first and pay off later. Because of this, people sometimes miss out on chances that could have helped them grow.This idea is still important because it shows how people make choices every day. Students might not want to study subjects that need more practice. Workers might not want to do tasks that seem hard. People may put off their personal goals if they seem hard or uncertain. Edison's words remind readers that trying hard doesn't mean you've failed; it usually means that something important is possible.The quote tells people to think about work in a new way. Instead of viewing work as a hindrance, it proposes perceiving it as an integral component of the opportunity.This quote is often used in classrooms, offices, and talks about how to grow as a person. Teachers use it to show how important it is to be consistent. Employers share it to show that hard work pays off in the long run. People think about it when they are deciding whether or not to take on tasks that need a lot of patience.Edison's words still ring true because they describe a reality that many people know. At first, opportunities may not seem appealing, but those who are willing to put in the work often reap the benefits in the end.","Thomas alva edison was born in 1847 in the us.

Merge Labs vs Neuralink





ChatGPT-maker OpenAI has announced an investment in Merge Labs, a brain-computer interface (BCI) startup which was founded by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman. Rival to Elon Musk ’s Neuralink, the mission of Merge Labs is to develop safe and scaleable brain-computer interfaces. “We are excited to support and collaborate with Merge Labs as they turn an ambitious idea into reality and ultimately products that are useful for people,” said the company.OpenAI revealed that funding made by the company will support Merge Labs’ mission of creating safe, scalable brain-computer interfaces that could one day allow humans to interact with artificial intelligence directly through neural signals. The company has not yet disclosed the size of the investment, but the partnership underscores OpenAI’s growing interest in technologies that extend beyond software into hardware and human augmentation.Merge Labs is a research lab with the long-term mission of bridging biological and artificial intelligence to maximize human ability, agency, and experience. It is developing fundamentally new approaches⁠ (opens in a new window) to BCIs that are safe and interface with the brain at much higher bandwidth by combining biology, devices, and AI.The company is focused on creating non-invasive neural interfaces that can translate brain activity into digital commands. Unlike more invasive approaches that require surgical implants, Merge Labs aims to build consumer-ready devices that are both accessible and ethically designed.The company’s early prototypes reportedly use advanced sensors and machine learning models to interpret neural signals, with potential applications ranging from medical rehabilitation to enhanced productivity tools.Elon Musk founded Neuralink in 2016 and till now the company has made significant progress in developing brain implants which enable people with paralysis to control devices with the help of their thoughts. The Elon Musk-owned company recently raised $600 million at a $9 billion valuation and is conducting human trials.Merge Labs on the other hand, is reportedly working on less invasive brain interfaces with a strong emphasis on AI-powered enhancements. The focus of the startup is not just medical rehabilitation but broader human-AI integration.“I believe the merge has already started,” Altman wrote in a 2017 blog post. “We will be the first species ever to design our own descendants”.","Merge labs is a brain-computer interface (bci) startup founded by openai ceo sam altman.

Artificial intelligence is no longer something people only argue about in tech conferences or future forecasts. It is already quietly shaping daily life in profound and often unexpected ways. From customer support chats to recommendation engines, from coding tools to medical research, AI is now part of how work gets done efficiently. And according to Bill Gates , the pace of change is about to speed up even more dramatically.In his latest annual letter, The Year Ahead, the Microsoft co-founder lays out a clear message. AI will reshape society, economies, and jobs faster than most people expect. Gates says he remains optimistic about technology, but this time his optimism comes with serious warnings. The benefits are real. So are the risks. And ignoring either would be a grave mistake.Gates has spent decades watching technology alter economies and daily life. In his letter, he says AI is different from past waves of innovation. Not just faster, but broader. He argues that artificial intelligence could affect more parts of society than any previous human-made tool.He points to progress already happening. AI is accelerating disease research, improving climate modelling, and expanding access to digital education.Tasks that once took years can now be completed in months, sometimes weeks. For Gates, this is proof that AI can solve hard problems if used well.But he also stresses that hope alone is not a strategy. Institutions, governments, and workers are not fully prepared for how quickly these changes are arriving. Without planning, the speed of AI adoption could leave many people behind.One of Gates’ biggest concerns is how AI could be misused. As advanced tools become more accessible, the barrier to harmful use drops. He has warned that open-source AI systems could be exploited by bad actors, including non-state groups.In particular, Gates has raised alarms about biological threats. He suggests that AI-assisted misuse could pose risks even greater than naturally occurring pandemics. That is not a casual statement. It reflects a growing fear among researchers that powerful tools, in the wrong hands, could scale harm faster than ever before.Gates argues that global cooperation is essential. Clear rules, oversight, and governance structures are needed. At the same time, he acknowledges the tension. Too many restrictions could slow beneficial innovation. Too little could invite danger. Finding the balance will not be easy.Jobs sit at the centre of Gates’ warning. He says AI makes it possible to produce more goods and services with less human labour. That reality will change how companies hire and how work is valued.Some of this is already visible. In software development, AI tools help programmers write, test, and maintain code faster. Gates notes that developers can now be significantly more productive, which lowers costs and reshapes team structures.He also points to sectors like warehouse operations and phone-based customer service. As AI systems improve, these roles are likely to face pressure. Automation will not arrive all at once, but it will arrive steadily.Gates does not frame this as doom. He frames it as a disruption that needs preparation.Beyond job losses, Bill Gates talks about how work itself might change. If AI boosts productivity enough, shorter workweeks could become possible. The same output, fewer hours. It sounds appealing. But he is careful not to present it as automatic.Whether these gains benefit most people depends on policy choices. Who owns the productivity gains. How companies share them. Without thoughtful decisions, Gates warns that efficiency could concentrate wealth instead of spreading it.This is where governments and institutions matter. AI alone will not deliver fairness. People have to decide what to do with the gains it creates.","Gates says he remains optimistic about technology, but this time his optimism comes with serious warnings.

Khaby Lame’s $900M deal introduces AI-powered brand expansion

“Digital Twin”





Khaby Lame, the world’s most-followed TikTok creator, has reached a major milestone by selling his main operating company, Step Distinctive Limited, in a deal valued at nearly $900 million. The transaction was finalized on January 23, 2026, and is being described as one of the largest business deals ever completed by an individual social media creator. Through this agreement, the acquiring company gains exclusive commercial rights to the Khaby Lame brand for the next three years. The deal highlights how internet fame, when managed correctly, can turn into a massive global business with long-term financial security.The significance of the deal rests not merely on its scale but also on its implications for the creator economy. The brand of Khaby was created arguably through a string of short silent comedy clips that the whole world came to admire. Khaby’s simplistic yet relatable commentary on ridiculously complicated life hacks earned his brand the universal touch that spans the globe. What the current deal also demonstrates is that individual creators are now able to command valuations previously granted to the big studios.The value of digital influencers is now arguably one of the biggest things in the space of advertising and entertainment.One of the most important parts of the agreement is the creation of a hyper-realistic AIof Khaby Lame. This digital version of the creator will be used to produce advertisements and promotional content without requiring Khaby to be physically present. Brands can now run campaigns in multiple countries at the same time, even when Khaby is not available to shoot content. Industry experts say this solves a major problem in influencer marketing, the limits of time, travel, and personal availability.Also, by licensing his digital avatar, Khaby is able to make sure that his unique look and personality are alive and kicking 24/7 while his team manages it and approves the content. The AI maintains his signature silent humor to ensure the authenticity of the image. This is a lesson in scaling one’s brand quicker while minimizing the workload for the celebrity, a trend that may define how celebrities work in the future.In a broader sense, however, the deal is also a function of a larger augmented landscape where digital consolidation is a valuable business in entertainment. As legacy companies merge to simply stay afloat, Khaby’s deal is historic in that a personal human brand is being monetized to an unprecedented scale. As AI technology blends into personal brands, Khaby Lame’s nearly $900 million exit serves as a new global bar to measure where personal brands are headed.","Khaby lame, the world’s most-followed tiktok creator, has reached a major milestone by selling his main operating company, step distinctive limited, in a deal valued at nearly $900 million.

Looking ahead





In a groundbreaking move to protect the youngest members of society, the UAE has officially enacted the Child Digital Safety Law, a regulation that shifts the focus of online safety from tech companies directly to the home.Under this new legal framework, parents and legal guardians are now held legally accountable for the digital footprints and online activities of their children. This isn't just a set of guidelines; it is a formal recognition that the virtual world is as significant as the physical one.The United Arab Emirates has issued a new Federal Decree-Law on Child Digital Safety aimed at protecting children from online risks and harmful digital experiences. This law took effect on January 1, 2026 and represents one of the most comprehensive approaches to child online protection in the region. It applies not only to digital platforms but also to parents, caregivers and internet service providers.The move is part of the UAE’s broader strategy to make 2026 the “Year of the Family”, putting children’s well-being at the centre of digital policy and safety initiatives. The law outlines specific ""Digital Due Diligence"" that parents are expected to follow.It moves beyond simply checking a child's browser history and enters the realm of active prevention.Guardians are now required to ensure that children are not accessing age-inappropriate platforms, particularly social media apps that have strict 13+ or 16+ age limits. Parents must monitor for signs of cyber-harassment and take immediate action if their child is being targeted or, conversely, if their child is engaging in bullying behavior toward others.Key responsibilities under the new law include:Under the Federal Decree-Law No. 26 of 2025 on Child Digital Safety, the UAE has established a strict penalty structure to ensure that the ""Digital Due Diligence"" is taken seriously. While the law is currently in a grace period for full operational compliance, the legal framework for fines is already clear.Parents and guardians found in significant breach of their monitoring duties, such as allowing children under 13 to bypass age restrictions or ignoring evidence of digital grooming, face administrative fines that typically begin at AED 5,000 for initial instances of neglect.For more severe cases, the law integrates with the existing Wadeema Law, where ""digital abandonment"" can lead to much steeper financial hits. If a child’s safety is directly compromised due to a lack of parental oversight, fines can reach up to AED 50,000 to AED 100,000.Furthermore, repeat offenders or those who intentionally facilitate a child's access to harmful content may see these amounts doubled.

What is Nitaqat Programme ?





Overview of the second phase





Results from the first phase





Implementation framework and requirements





After the success of its first phase, the Saudi Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development has launched the second phase of the Nitaqat Al-Mutawar programme, aiming to create more than 340,000 private sector jobs for citizens over the next three years.The Nitaqat programme is a national labour market policy that encourages private sector companies to hire Saudi nationals by setting sector-specific localisation targets. It is designed to increase Saudi participation in private employment, reduce unemployment, and align workforce supply with market demand.Through a classification system and targeted Saudization rates, the programme seeks to balance business growth with national employment priorities. Since its launch, Nitaqat has been positioned as a long-term tool to support economic stability while strengthening the role of Saudi talent in the private sector.According to the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Development, the second phase of Nitaqat Al-Mutawar will run for three years from 2026 and aims to localise more than 340,000 jobs for Saudi men and women in the private sector.The ministry said the new phase was developed following a comprehensive analysis of labour market conditions and the capabilities of establishments across various sectors.The focus is on creating quality job opportunities, increasing citizen participation, and achieving a sustainable balance between labour supply and demand.Minister Ahmed Al-Rajhi said the programme was carefully designed to support localisation without hindering private sector growth. He noted that the initiative is intended to strengthen the national economy while reinforcing long-term confidence among private sector employers.The ministry highlighted the strong performance of the programme’s first phase, launched in 2022. Over the past three years, it has contributed to the employment of more than 550,000 Saudi citizens in the private sector.This figure exceeded the original target of 340,000 jobs, with officials saying the programme played a significant role in stimulating localisation efforts, reducing unemployment rates, and expanding Saudi workforce participation across industries.Al-Rajhi said the experience of previous phases had confirmed the ability of Saudi citizens to succeed and perform efficiently in a wide range of professions, providing a solid foundation for launching the next phase.Deputy Minister of Human Resources and Social Development for the Labour Sector Abdullah Abuthnain said the ministry conducted extensive analytical studies covering all sectors and establishments before finalising the new phase.These studies resulted in realistic and targeted Saudisation rates that reflect the nature of different roles and prevailing market conditions, taking into account the availability of qualified Saudi nationals. Abuthnain said this approach is expected to enhance job stability, raise productivity, and deliver genuine sustainability in the labour market.The ministry added that the second phase will continue to support citizen participation, improve job quality, and reinforce private sector competitiveness, as Saudi Arabia advances its broader labour and economic reform agenda.","Saudi arabia launched nitaqat 2.0, targeting 340,000 private sector jobs for citizens over three years.

'Where are 12 H-1B workers? ': Indian-American group says consulting firms operating from home address in Texas not illegal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/where-are-12-h-1b-workers-indian-american-group-says-consulting-firms-operating-from-home-address-in-texas-not-illegal/articleshow/127284024.cms,"Trump Visa Crackdown Hits India's Neighbours, US Pauses Immigration For Pakistan, Bangladesh, Nepal

What is the major outburst over Sara Gonzales' video?

What is legal and not a red flag in an H-1B staffing company?

The client's address is listed on the LCA (Labon Condition Application)

Candidate's wage matches LCA location

Employment relationship is genuine

Home work is infrequent or hybrid (local)

LLC (limited Liability Company) address listed at the owner's home does not mean all H-1B candidates work from there

The operating office can be at another location in the same city where day-to-day work takes place.

Both companies are likely linked to Telugus





Indian-American investors and advocacy groups came together to shred Texas woman Sara Gonzales's massive H-1B expose to pieces and asserted that she has no idea how the H-1B staffing works in the US. In her viral video, Gonzales targeted two companies: 3Bees Technologies and Qubitz Tech Systems, and claimed that these two companies hired H-1Bs but when she visited the addresses, she found no office, no work.Indian American Advocacy Council co-founder Rajeev Sharma said it is completely legal to start a business listing the home address, the way Apple, Google, Amazon and Disney did. Legal immigrants trying to work should not be harassed, Sharma said, adding that Gonzales herself might be in the US illegally.Gonzales visited the house of Hari Madiraju, the visa contact person for Qubitz and asked whether the 12 H-1B workers that he hired were working from his house. Hari called 911 and said: ""Somebody is knocking on my door and then they are like threatening me. ... Please, can you help me?""The video stirred a strong reaction from 'America First' activists who questioned if Hari did not do anything wrong, why he did not clarify it and why he instead called the police. James Blunt, a US-based entrepreneur, said Gonzales does not understand how the H-1B works. Staffing companies hiring H-1Bs on behalf of IT companies is legal and an established practise. ""Contracting workers out to end clients is not a red flag—it’s the backbone of staffing and consulting. This is explicitly allowed and commonplace. Calling it “weird” doesn’t make it illegal; it just makes her uninformed,"" Blunt wrote.Gonzales said the phone numbers listed on the 3Bees Technologies website are all Indian numbers and the address mentioned is in Telangana, India. The director, president and agent of the company was listed as Vamsi Krishna Vajinapally, Gonzales said.","Texas woman sara gonzales made a viral video about h-1b staffing companies.
