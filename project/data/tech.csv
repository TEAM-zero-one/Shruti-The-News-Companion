NGLV progressing

BENGALURU: India’s first privately manufactured Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle ( PSLV ), being built by a consortium of HAL and L&T, will carry a technology demonstration satellite ( TDS-1 ) that will test up to 35 new indigenous technologies . Isro chairman V Narayanan revealed this in an exclusive interview to TOI and said the launch, scheduled for the third quarter of this year, will mark a milestone as the first PSLV manufactured by the private sector under a contract for five rockets.The vehicle is in “advanced stages of realisation” with Isro providing technical guidance to the industrial partners.“It is called a technology demonstration satellite (TDS-1)... There are 35 experimental things. Among other things, along with chemical propulsion, we are also going to use electric propulsion. We are also going to demonstrate indigenous atomic clock, quantum payloads. So, a lot of things are in the store. And right now the payload is getting realised.”The final number of experiments, targeted at 35, will be confirmed later. In TDS-1 Isro will test a 300 milli-Newton (300mN) electric propulsion thruster developed at Isro’s Liquid Propulsion Systems Centre (LPSC), which Narayanan headed before taking over as Isro chairman. The new thruster is currently undergoing life cycle testing.He said Isro had earlier tried a 75mN thruster on the GSAT-9, but what will go on TDS-1 “will be the first time an entirely indigenous system will be deployed,” Narayanan said. The organisation had earlier developed associated components like the power processing unit, control systems and propellant tankage internally.In a wide-ranging interview, Narayanan also detailed Isro’s Next Generation Launch Vehicle (NGLV) programme. “...Our first launcher, the SLV-3, had the capability of putting around 35-40 kg to Low Earth Orbit (LEO). From that, our heaviest rocket (LVM-3) is capable of taking around 8,500 kg to LEO. Now, in NGLV the lift of mass will be around 1,000 tonnes and that height of the vehicle is 93m, more than 30-35 storey building height,” Narayanan said.“The NGLV will feature three propulsive stages and two strap-on boosters. The core stage will be powered by nine LOX-methane engines, each generating 110 tonnes of thrust, with a propellant loading of 475 tonnes. The second stage will use two LOX-methane engines of the same class with 128 tonnes of propellant. The upper stage will use a LOX-hydrogen cryogenic engine (the C-32) with 32 tonnes of propellant capacity,” Narayanan said.He said the configuration study was completed and Isro was in the process of development of subsystems, for example engines. “The design for the 11 LOX-methane engines (nine in core stage and two in second stage) has been finalised and we are in the process of giving clearances for fabrication,” he said.Mission studies have been completed, while rocket structures and tankage designs are ongoing, he said, adding that Isro is currently in discussions with industry partners for manufacturing while simultaneously developing necessary test facilities.","Isro chairman v narayanan revealed this in an exclusive interview to toi.

"Porsche loses 'premium' tag in China, thanks to 'smarter' tech at budget price",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/international-business/porsche-loses-premium-tag-in-china-thanks-to-smarter-tech-at-budget-price/articleshow/118342225.cms,"BERLIN: After decades of dominating China's market for high-performance cars with precision engineering, German automakers are losing out to Chinese rivals that have shifted the definition of a high-end car to one that is electric, smart and affordable.Many new Chinese vehicles resemble their German rivals, including the popular Xiaomi SU7, which mimics Porsche's Taycan. The SU7 rivals the Taycan in power and braking, but also includes integrated artificial intelligence that can, for instance, help with parking and greet drivers with their favorite song. The cherry on top: It sells for roughly half the price of a Taycan. As a result, German automakers that for decades commanded China's premium car market are now seeing their sales dwindle, while Xiaomi - a leading Chinese smartphone manufacturer - last year sold more than 100,000 models of the SU7.Among the hardest hit has been Porsche, which reported last month that its deliveries in China plunged 28% in 2024. Although Porsche's sales were up in every other region around the world, the decline in China was significant enough to pull down its global deliveries for the year by 3%.For years, German automakers relied on the Chinese market to make up for weaker demand elsewhere, leading them to ignore deeper problems at home. Chief among them was a reluctance to adopt technology that has come to define driving in China: electric vehicles equipped with sophisticated software and, increasingly, artificial intelligence.Market experts said advances in software and features such as automated driving and remote control had become standard in Chinese electric cars , pressuring European automakers used to cashing in on their brand names to step up their game. ""I think Chinese consumers right now are ready to accept that Chinese companies can produce cars that are considered as premium to them,"" said an economist.This month, Porsche said it would part ways with its finance chief and a top sales executive, both of whom had come under pressure for poor performance, including in China. Last week, Porsche said it would cut up to 1,900 jobs in Germany over the coming years. The SU7 is not yet available for export, but a few models have reached the US. Ford Motor CEO James D Farley Jr. said he had one shipped to Chicagoand ""didn't want to give it up"".Xiaomi has also been testing pared-down versions of its SU7 Ultra, which will be released in China in March, on Germany's storied racetrack, the Nurburgring. In Oct, the car set a record for the ""fastest four-door sedan,"" and industry media and car fans cheered the news, excited that the SU7 had beaten Porsche's Taycan by 20 seconds. Racetrack officials, however, said the times were not comparable because the Chinese car was a preliminary version competing in an essentially open category, while the Taycan was a showroom-ready model and ran in a highly regulated category. Regardless, the message was unmistakable. nyt","German automakers that for decades commanded china's premium car market are now seeing their sales dwindle.

EE warns users about rising scam risks on Valentine's Day,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/uk/ee-warns-users-about-rising-scam-risks-on-valentines-day/articleshow/118272199.cms,"Representative image

How people are exposing themselves to scams

Signs of a romance scam

Asking for money or gifts (64%)



Using urgent or emotional language (49%)



Avoiding video calls or in-person meetings (41%)



Telling a sob story to gain sympathy (31%)



Giving inconsistent answers (24%)



Evading personal questions (20%)



Making grand promises or boasting excessively (12%)



Asking overly personal questions (11%)



UK mobile network operator EE has issued an urgent warning about the dangers of sharing personal details online, particularly when dating. The mobile network provider found that many users are giving away sensitive information too easily, putting themselves at risk of scams and impersonation fraud.According to EE’s survey of 2,000 UK phone users, an alarming 93% admitted to sharing personal details over text, messaging apps, or social media. A significant number do so while chatting with new acquaintances or online dating. With Valentine's Day heightening social interactions, EE is urging people to remain cautious.""Online dating has opened exciting new options for singles, but also a novel channel for criminals hunting for new ways to defraud their victims,"" EE stated.Research shows that one in ten (11%) people currently dating have been targeted by romance scams . Even more concerning, one in five victims lost an average of £2,500 due to these fraudulent schemes.According to The Mirror, EE’s findings revealed that 65% of users shared their phone number, 51% disclosed their location and 35% provided access to their social media profile.Additionally, 345 respondents said they had noticed suspicious behaviour from someone they were messaging, while 15% had been directly asked for money.The main danger lies in trusting people who may not be who they claim to be. Fraudsters can use personal information to impersonate victims, potentially leading to identity theft and financial loss.Even non-EE customers should stay alert. Last year, during the Valentine’s period, EE recorded a sharp rise in scam texts. In February 2024 alone, the company blocked 12 million malicious messages—well above the usual monthly average of 8.9 million. The network expects similar activity this year.""Scammers are experts at preying on the vulnerable,"" warns Richard Wainer, EE’s regulatory affairs director. ""At this time of year, when social media is full of public displays of affection, it can be tempting to turn a blind eye to the red flags, but spotting them is more important than ever"", Wainer added.To help users stay safe, EE has identified key red flags to watch out for when chatting online:EE urges users to remain cautious when communicating with people they don’t know well, especially when emotions are involved. Scammers often take advantage of trust and vulnerability, making it crucial to recognise the warning signs before it’s too late.","Uk mobile network operator ee has issued an urgent warning about the dangers of sharing personal details online, particularly when dating.

BEIJING: Chinese technology giant Tencent on Monday said it had started trialling its own artificial intelligence reasoning model after integrating DeepSeek into some of its products, saying the move would make responses ""more 'human'"".Insurgent Chinese AI startup DeepSeek made global headlines last month when it unveiled its R1 chatbot that can seemingly match American competitors at a fraction of the cost.Since then, a series of major Chinese companies have said they will integrate DeepSeek's technology into their products.On Monday, Tencent said in a post on WeChat, the social media platform it owns, that selected users of its Yuanbao chatbot may address queries to either DeepSeek or its homegrown AI reasoning model "" Hunyuan Thinker "".""With the support of two deep reasoning models, the question-answering is more professional, the reasoning is more powerful, and the writing is more 'human',"" Tencent said of the beta testing rollout.Tencent, which also operates the QQ messaging app and is a major player in online gaming, has sought to capture a larger share of the burgeoning AI market in China.The Shenzhen-based company is understood to have started exploring the integration of DeepSeek into multiple products, with some users of the domestic version of WeChat noting the addition of an AI search function on Sunday.A Tencent spokesperson confirmed to AFP that the domestic app, which has over a billion monthly active users, had ""recently started beta testing access to DeepSeek"".The move intensifies competition in China's internet search sector after tech titan Baidu said Sunday it would weave DeepSeek into its market-leading search engine to ""enrich a more diversified search experience"".Last week, Chinese electric-vehicle giant BYD said it would integrate DeepSeek's software into its cars, following other domestic automakers like Geely, Great Wall Motors and Leapmotor.Despite its rise to prominence at home, DeepSeek has drawn scrutiny in some countries over its collection and handling of users' personal data.South Korea became the latest jurisdiction to remove the chatbot from app stores on Monday pending a security review, following similar moves in Italy, Taiwan, Australia and some US states.","Chinese technology giant tencent has started trialling its own artificial intelligence reasoning model.

Takeaways: Tesla has sued Chinese customers and journalists and won almost every time,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/takeaways-tesla-has-sued-chinese-customers-and-journalists-and-won-almost-every-time/articleshow/118180992.cms,"In this photo, Zhang Yazhou sits on the roof of her damaged Tesla Model 3 with a bullhorn outside a Tesla dealership in Zhengzhou (Image credits: AP)

Tesla did not return requests for comment. Here are some key things to know about Tesla's success in China:

Media coverage of Tesla in China is constrained

BEIJING: Tesla has embraced an aggressive legal strategy in China to stifle its critics suing its own customers.That's left some Tesla owners desperate. Zhang Yazhou protested publicly that her Model 3's brakes had failed and caused an accident in 2021 that sent her parents to the hospital. Tesla said that wasn't true and sued her for defamation. A Chinese court ordered Zhang to pay the $1.1-trillion company more than $23,000 in damages and publicly apologize for her criticism.""I refuse to accept it,"" said Zhang, who appealed the verdict. ""As a consumer, even if I said something wrong, I have the right to comment and criticize. I spoke about my feelings as a user of the car. It has nothing to do with damaging their reputation.""As concerns mount about eroding checks and balances in the US, Tesla's record in China shows how it has thrived in a system where regulators, the courts and media all answer to the ruling Communist Party.It's not common for automakers in China or elsewhere to sue their own customers. But Tesla has done so successfully in China, where Elon Musk 's company has used the courts and the patronage of a powerful leader to silence critics, reap financial rewards and limit its accountability.Musk has a powerful patron in China Tesla's commercial and political success in China has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: Li Qiang, the former party boss of Shanghai who is now China's premier, second in rank only to President Xi Jinping . Tesla built its first overseas factory on the outskirts of China's financial capital under his watch in 2019.With Li's support, Tesla was the first foreign automaker allowed to retain complete control over its China venture. Tesla got low-interest loans, tax breaks, favorable regulatory changes and other benefits.In January 2020, Musk unveiled the first Chinese-made Teslas on a stage in Shanghai. That year, Tesla turned an annual profit for the first time in its history and Musk was soon declared the world's richest person.Musk's ""greater objective was winning influence over the people that mattered for him, that enabled him to get things done,"" said Bill Russo, founder of Automobility Ltd, an advisory firm based in Shanghai. ""He's done a good job of it in China, and he's done it now with the influence he purchased with his relationship with Trump.""Requests for comment to the state council, which is run by Li Qiang, went unanswered.Tesla has had an impressive winning streak in Chinese courts Over the last four years, Tesla has sued at least six car owners in China who had sudden vehicle malfunctions, quality complaints or accidents they claimed were caused by mechanical failures.The company has also sued at least six bloggers and two Chinese media outlets that wrote critically about the company, according to a review of public court documents and Chinese media reports by The Associated Press.Tesla won all eleven cases for which AP could determine the verdicts. Two judgments are on appeal. One case was settled out of court.Tesla has not only won the defamation cases it brought against unhappy car owners and critical journalists, it has also prevailed in lawsuits customers have filed against it.An AP review of a Chinese government database of court filings published online found 81 civil judgments in which car owners sued Tesla over safety and quality issues or contract disputes. Car owners won in only nine of those cases.While some industry experts say it's generally difficult for customers to win such cases, others say it's remarkable for a foreign company to enjoy such blazing success in Chinese courts.""For Tesla to win that percentage of the time is an anomaly,"" said Russo, who also used to be regional head of Chrysler in northeast Asia. ""The odds are stacked against you. It's like going to the casino and winning every hand.""In a statement to AP, the Shanghai high people's court said that judgements are the result of a ""fair trial.""""It cannot be assumed that the party has received 'special protection' or 'special treatment' because of their victory,"" the court wrote.Two Chinese journalists based in Shanghai told AP there is an unwritten rule to avoid critical coverage of Tesla. Both spoke on condition of anonymity, fearing retaliation.""We were told by our editor that we should not write negatively about Tesla because it is a key company that was introduced and protected by the Shanghai government,"" a tech reporter told AP.Those who have strayed have found themselves in court. Musk's company sued media outlets PingWest and ifeng.com over negative coverage. PingWest had to apologize for a report that claimed Tesla's Shanghai factory was a ""sweatshop"" and pay Tesla 100,000 yuan ($13,700). The AP could not determine the outcome of the case against ifeng.com, which drew Tesla's ire after writing about the tribulations of car owners who fought Tesla.Electric vehicle giant BYD has also aggressively pursued media in court, including an unsuccessful lawsuit against Vice Media in the United States. More recently, electric vehicle makers Nio and Li Auto have stepped up defamation cases against bloggers in China who allegedly spread false information about their companies.Tesla, however, stands out even among its cut-throat Chinese competitors in going after car owners who suffered crashes.""Tesla used their legal advantages to bully Chinese car owners and people who speak up for them,"" said Feng Shiming, an auto blogger and Tesla owner who was ordered by a Shanghai court last year to pay Tesla 250,000 yuan ($34,000) after he wrote about Tesla's alleged brake failures. ""Tesla wants to have a chilling effect on society and terrify people so they will be scared to say anything negative about Tesla.""","Tesla's success in china has hinged on the support of a powerful patron: li qiang, the former party boss of shanghai who is now china's premier.

Bottoms Up

B9 Beverages , the maker of Bira 91 beer preparing for public listing, incurred a Rs 80 crore direct cost and increased losses due to removing the word 'private' from its name!In preparation for its 2026 IPO, the company transitioned from B9 Beverages Private Ltd to B9 Beverages Ltd . This modification required re-registration of product labels and led to suspended sales for several months, resulting in a Rs 80 crore inventory write-off and a 68% increase in losses for FY24, alongside a significant sales decline, according to an ET report.The company faced intensified market pressure from microbreweries, craft beer producers, and international brewers introducing premium products. B9 Beverages reported a net loss of Rs 748 crore for the year ending March 2024. The losses exceeded its total sales of Rs 638 crore, which decreased 22% compared to FY23.""Due to the name change, there was a 4-6 month cycle where we had to re-register labels and re-apply across states which resulted in literally no sales for several months despite demand for our products. While availability dwindled, we also saw policy and route to market changes in Delhi NCR and Andhra Pradesh, which accounts for more than a third of our sales,"" said Ankur Jain, founder at B9 Beverages Ltd. Sales volume dropped to 6-7 million cases in FY24 from nine million in FY23.Initially, Bira imported its Hefeweizen-style beer from Belgium ten years ago, but later shifted to domestic brewing for cost efficiency, eventually expanding to multiple third-party brewing facilities.""Negative cash flow of Rs84 crore and accumulated losses of Rs1,904 crore which eroded its full net worth indicate the existence of material uncertainty that may cast significant doubt about the group's ability to continue as a going concern,"" noted B9's auditor in its latest annual report.The beer segment requires substantial capital expenditure and working capital for growth, and the company is currently seeking additional funding to support its expansion plans. The company attributes its financial losses to a one-time inventory write-off associated with its previous brand name.The company explained, ""We had to write off Rs 80 crore worth of products due to the name change which amounted to Rs 80 crore one-time cost, directly impacting our profitability. However, growth is back since the third quarter, and we expect to make operating profit by next quarter and have enough scale and size to raise capital by 2026.""Industry analysts recognise that emerging brands like Bira contribute significantly not only through sales but also by introducing innovative products and experimental approaches to the sector.Vinod Giri, Director General of Brewers Association of India (BAI), stated, ""They complement the mainstream beer industry . But what these companies must bear in mind is that the appeal of a new different taste palate, whether wheat, dark lager, or craft is rooted in its uniqueness. So, their growth ambitions and expansion strategy should resist temptations of a quick scale up to become a mainstream product. That will just dilute the uniqueness of the product in consumers' mind and would be neither here nor there. So they must follow a business model which balances investor expectations of quick returns with the rate of consumer accretion that the point of difference in the product naturally permits.""Various brands including Simba, BeeYoung and Kati Patang have entered the Indian market, attracted by its warm climate, favourable demographics and growing prosperity. Global brewing companies have also expressed interest in investing in India, considering it among their top three strategic markets.During an investor call on Friday, United Breweries chief executive Vivek Gupta announced plans to invest Rs 750 crore in a new brewery in Uttar Pradesh, marking their first greenfield expansion in over ten years.

Lenskart IPO : Lenskart aims to double its valuation to $10 billion for its forthcoming initial public offering (IPO), as indicated by informed sources. The eyewear company plans to submit its draft documentation in May.Numerous startups spanning ecommerce, B2B and fintech sectors are preparing for public listings this year. Firms like Zepto, Groww, Bluestone, PharmEasy, Oyo, Ather Energy and Zetwerk are at various phases of their IPO groundwork.Despite optimistic outlook from banking professionals, these organisations will align their offering prices with prevailing market dynamics during listing, particularly those yet to achieve profitability, following last year's pattern.Recent discussions between Lenskart CEO Peyush Bansal and principal investors with IPO bankers have focused on the valuation for the $1-billion public offering. However, the final execution depends on market conditions at the time of launch.""Work is underway to file the draft red herring prospectus (DRHP) by May so it can… get listed this calendar year,"" a source told ET. ""Internally, some feel even more aggressive about the valuation, but that may not be in sync with current market conditions and one has to leave money on the table for incoming IPO investors.""""The firm, along with stakeholders, is now ready to go public,"" another source indicated to the financial daily, noting limited time remains for a pre-listing round.

Why are stock splits useful for investors?

Is Arista Networks overpriced?

The S&P 500 has demonstrated remarkable performance, with gains of 24% in 2023 and 23% in 2024. Given the robust economic conditions, substantial corporate earnings and advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), analysts project continued growth for the S&P 500 in 2025.Historical data from The Motley Fool showed the S&P has delivered positive returns 78% of the time across five decades. Following two consecutive years of 20%-plus gains, the index typically advances by approximately 12%, suggesting potential future growth.Stock splits are experiencing a resurgence, with these corporate actions historically preceding strong financial results. Companies implementing stock splits have garnered significant investor attention, with past data indicating subsequent robust performance.Here is an analysis of two established companies poised for potential significant gains in the current bull market.Arista Networks has demonstrated exceptional performance, with share price appreciation of 66% in the past year and 2,880% over ten years.

Third-quarter revenue reached $1.8 billion, showing 20% year-over-year growth, whilst earnings per share rose 35%.Despite trading at 56 times earnings, Arista's forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.95 suggests undervaluation relative to growth potential.

Bitcoin bull mania has gripped the crypto market once again. This time, in a meme coin format. Bitcoin Bull ($BTCBULL) just broke the $1 million milestone in its presale.The community-driven token is on a mission to give investors exposure to the BTC bull mania, which is hyped to touch $1 million and beyond. Whenever Bitcoin hits a major price milestone, $BTCBULL holders receive Bitcoin as a reward.BTC is one of the world’s most successful assets. It has registered an AAR (Average Annual Return) of 230%. For better context, the token has seen its value rise over 200 million percent since its beginning. However, most of the market missed out on BTC’s massive explosion over the years. $BTCBULL is here to alleviate the regret. With BTC expected to grow and expand further, from $100,000 to $250,000 and beyond $1 million, investors are optimistic. Increased media coverage, widespread adoption, and potential use in national reserves have strengthened the bullish narratives.With $BTCBULL, investors can join the Bitcoin movement at an affordable price. The platform hosts $BTCBULL and $BTC airdrops that coincide with the key price milestones of Bitcoin.True, BTC has experienced multifold growth over the years and most investors can’t afford to pay $100,000 to buy a Bitcoin. But $BTCBULL gives the community exposure to BTC’s growth at small costs.$BTCBULL has a total supply of 21 billion tokens, while BTC has a total supply of 21 million. $BTCBULL has implemented a built-in deflationary model to bring more scarcity into the tokenomics over time.The burning mechanism is designed to drive the value of the token by taking advantage of the inverse relationship between price and supply. It rewards long-term $BTCBULL investors by creating upward price pressure through increased demand.Exciting $BTCBULL airdrops or burns are activated every time $BTC hits a new price milestone. For example, when the BTC price hits $100,000 after the $BTCBULL presale sell-out, the token will make its debut exchange listing. When the Bitcoin price hits $125,000, a token burn goes live, and when it touches $150,000, a BTC airdrop will go live.Being built on the Ethereum blockchain using the EVM standard, the token is more conducive to adoption and trading than BRC-20 tokens.While BRC-20 tokens demand Bitcoin-native wallets that are complex to handle for everyday investors, Ethereum wallets offer seamless trading. Although $BTCBULL is an Ethereum token, the rewards are compatible with multichain wallets. After the presale sell-out, the token will be listed on leading crypto exchanges .With a multichain wallet, $BTCBULL holders can receive $BTC and $BTCBULL airdrop rewards. The ongoing $BTCBULL presale is also hosting a passive income program that rewards users for depositing their tokens in the contract. $BTCBULL rewards will be distributed to passive income participants throughout the presale and for the following two years.The crypto market is crowded with meme coins. Yet, there are few Bitcoin-themed meme coins. That is a shame, since both meme coins and BTC are evergreen topics. $BTCBULL cleverly combines these two and offers investors a fun and inclusive way to earn bitcoin rewards .In a market full of dog and frog coins, $BTCBULL stands out with its vibrant illustrations and bold narratives. Although it has been just days since the presale launched, the community is fast-growing. As a project that targets both Bitcoin purists and meme coin degens, $BTCBULL has a target market worth over 2 trillion dollars.$BTCBULL represents Bitcoin bullishness and cheers for BTC’s journey to $1 million through memes, reward programs, and community engagement by tapping into Bitcoin’s deep-rooted brand strength.$BTCBULL has joined forces with Best Wallet to offer a seamless presale experience. Early backers can buy the token via the Upcoming Tokens section on Best Wallet.

It also imposed significant financial penalties on app store operators and internet hosting providers that continued to distribute or support TikTok.According to The New York Times, TikTok executives expressed optimism during a briefing call on Tuesday that Apple and Google would soon reinstate the app. H. Lee Justine, a TikTok creator and author who participated in the call, confirmed the statement.""They said that the administration had given them a lot of information that they wouldn't be penalized and that they were really hopeful that any day now they would put it back in the app stores,"" she said in an interview.""It makes me very hopeful that they felt that they could do this because hopefully this means that long term there's not going to be issues and this will work out,"" she added.Despite Apple and Google preventing new TikTok downloads, previously installed versions continued functioning normally on American devices.TikTok's reinstatement on app stores is a promising development, granting the company until early April to secure a buyer. This marks a dramatic turnaround—just a month ago, it faced a ban with strong bipartisan support in Congress.

The media and technology company sued Ross Intelligence—a now-defunct legal research firm—in 2020, alleging that it unlawfully used content from its legal platform, Westlaw, to train an AI model without authorisation.Judge Stephanos Bibas of the 3rd US Circuit Court of Appeals ruled a decision on Tuesday that Ross Intelligence was not entitled to use Thomson Reuters' content under US copyright law to develop a competing platform.According to the Associated Press, Bibas, in the summary judgment, concluded that ""none of Ross's possible defenses holds water"" and ruled in Reuters' favour regarding the ""fair use"" matter.Under US law, the ""fair use"" doctrine permits limited use of copyrighted materials for purposes such as teaching, research, or creating a transformative work.In an email to WIRED, Reuters' representative Jeffrey McCoy expressed satisfaction with the verdict, stating that: “We are pleased that the court granted summary judgment in our favor and concluded that Westlaw’s editorial content created and maintained by our attorney editors, is protected by copyright and cannot be used without our consent,” he wrote. “The copying of our content was not ‘fair use.’”Reuters' victory emerges amidst an increasing number of legal challenges initiated by creators, artists and music companies against AI system developers over comparable concerns.The common thread in these legal disputes is the allegation that technology firms utilised vast collections of human-authored content to train their AI systems for generating text that mimics human writing, without seeking authorisation or offering payment to the original content creators.OpenAI and its commercial partner Microsoft are facing copyright infringement lawsuits from renowned authors, including John Grisham, Jodi Picoult, and ""Game of Thrones"" creator George R.R.
