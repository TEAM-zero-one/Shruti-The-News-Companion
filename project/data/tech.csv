ISRO Makes History As ‘Bahubali’ Rocket Places India’s Heaviest Communication Satellite In Orbit

CHENNAI/BENGALURU: Isro Sunday launched the 4,410kg CMS-03 or the Gsat-7R, a communication satellite that will enhance telecommunication coverage across the strategic Indian Ocean Region (IOR) for the Indian Navy.The launch of the heaviest communication satellite from Indian soil onboard LVM3-M5 from the second launch pad at the Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota, marked the fifth operational flight of LVM3. The mission also saw a new in-orbit experiment - a successful re-ignition of the cryogenic upper stage.About 16 minutes after lift-off, LVM-3 placed Gsat-7R into a sub-Geosynchronous Transfer Orbit (sub-GTO) with a perigee (farthest point from Earth) of only 26,700km.Gsat-7R is designed to replace Gsat-7 (Rukmini), which was launched in 2013 and is primarily dedicated to Indian Navy, while Isro had launched another satellite from the same family - Gsat-7A - for the Indian Air Force.As per the Navy, Gsat-7R includes many indigenous state-of-the-art components developed specifically to meet its operational requirements. The Navy said that in an era of complex security challenges, the satellite represents its determination to protect the nation's maritime interests, leveraging advanced technology through self-reliance.""Gsat-7Rwill provide robust telecommunication coverage across IOR. Its payload includes transponders capable of supporting voice, data, and video links over multiple communication bands. This satellite will significantly enhance connectivity with high-capacity bandwidth, enabling seamless and secure communication links between ships, aircraft, submarines, and Maritime Operations Centres,"" the Navy stated.UR Rao Satellite Centre director M Sankaran said the satellite carries advanced payloads in multiple frequency bands - UHF, S-band, C-band and Ku-band - and includes several indigenous technologies such as a 1,200-litre propulsion tank and collapsible antenna systems. ""All systems are functioning normally. The satellite is healthy, and all isolation valves have opened as expected,"" Sankaran said.As per Isro's own description of LVM-3, its capacity to GTO (around 36,000km perigee) is only 4,000 tonnes. Until Sunday, all satellites Isro put into GTO using an LVM-3 have weighed under 4,000kg -anything heavier than that has been launched using foreign launch vehicles.Isro chairman V Narayanan said: ""...The vehicle performance was enhanced to increase its payload capacity by 10%. The satellite has a life of 15 years and carries a host of new technologies. We accomplished this mission despite difficult weather conditions.""","Gsat-7r is designed to replace gsat-7 (rukmini), which was launched in 2013. It is primarily dedicated to indian navy, while isro had launched another satellite from the same family for the indian air force.

"Vedanta, BEL & more: Top stocks to buy on November 4 — Check list",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/vedanta-bel-bank-of-baroda-bpcl-gail-top-stocks-to-buy-on-november-4check-list/articleshow/125072470.cms,"(Disclaimer: Recommendations and views on the stock market, other asset classes or personal finance management tips given by experts are their own. These opinions do not represent the views of The Times of India)





CLSA has an outperform rating on Vedanta with the target price at Rs 580. Analysts said that the company’s July-Sept quarter (Q2FY26) earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortisation (EBIDTA) of Rs 11,400 crore was in line with consensus. It guided for higher FY26 EBIDTA, driven by higher commodity prices and operational improvement. Over the next couple of years ramp-up of expansion projects and backward integration (largely aluminium, power and zinc) are likely to be the key drivers. Debt at parent Vedanta Resources (VRL) is now well funded, while demerger is guided to be complete by end-FY26. The outcome of the $2 billion bid for Jai Prakash Associates is a key monitorable given it is a diversified asset.Nomura has a neutral rating on BEL with the target price at Rs 427. Analysts said the company reported strong Q2FY26 numbers but rich valuations limit any upside for the stock. They raised BEL’s FY26 EBITDA and profit after tax (PAT) estimates by 2% and 1%. They also estimated that its PAT would show a compounded annual growth rate of 13% between FY25 and FY28. Analysts also said BEL’s order book was robust but warned that large orders have larger execution timelines.HSBC has a buy rating on Bank of Baroda with the target price raised to Rs 340. Analysts said during Q2FY26, the lender showed a broad-based sequential loan growth, net interest margin (NIM) expansion and asset quality performance were key positives. Incrementally, its operating performance will likely remain healthy with an upside risk from better asset quality. They also raised FY26-FY28 earnings per share (EPS) estimates by 5-7%.Jefferies has a buy rating on BPCL with the target price at Rs 430. Analysts said that during Q2FY26 the company reported strong EBITDA because of strong refining & marketing inventory gains. They also said that the govt's compensation for LPG losses will boost earnings over the next few quarters. However, they said marketing profitability has weakened somewhat in Q3, and inventory losses are likely. Also that large capex in refining and petchem would drag return on capital employed (RoCE). Analysts said BPCL’s earnings outlook was strong on range bound crude given OPEC supply.Citigroup has a buy rating on GAIL with the target price at Rs 215. Analysts said GAIL’s Q2FY26 EBITDA at Rs 3,200 crore was ahead of estimate, aided by strong gas trading performance, with gas transmission volumes also showing modest recovery. Petchem performance, however, remained subdued, they said. The management reiterated its guidance for gas trading profitability, lowered its guidance for gas transmission volumes and remains confident on their tariff hike expectations. Analysts were encouraged by the granularity provided on gas trading, which should boost investor comfort, and also from upcoming commissioning of new pipelines, which should aid volume growth even if all else stayed equal.","Clsa has an outperform rating on vedanta with the target price at rs 580.

Dallas Cowboys looking for a pass-rusher to boost a struggling defense

Adding pass-rushers may not fix the real issues

More on NFL trade coverage

The Dallas Cowboys are heading into the NFL trade deadline with questions to answer. Sitting at 3-4-1, the team has shown flashes of offensive firepower but has struggled on defense. After Monday night’s game against the Arizona Cardinals, the front office will need to decide whether to make a move to strengthen the defensive line and improve their chances down the stretch. The Cowboys face pressure to address glaring weaknesses in the secondary and defensive consistency, with fans and analysts watching closely to see if big trades or strategic adjustments will salvage their playoff hopes this season.Dallas has made no secret that adding defensive help is a priority. Ian Rapoport of NFL Network reported that the Cowboys are eyeing edge rushers to improve their pass rush. “We haven’t talked about the Cowboys enough because they play Monday night. But in advance of the trade deadline, every time he is asked, Jerry Jones talks about the possibility of the Cowboys making a big trade. Not like Micah Parsons, they did that this offseason but I wouldn’t be surprised if the Cowboys trade for a pass-rusher.My understanding is they are in the market for a D-line or defensive end. A couple of names to keep an eye on: Bradley Chubb, the Dolphins veteran, Jaelan Phillips, another standout Dolphins edge rusher. Arden Key of the Tennessee Titans, too, among the names to keep an eye on for Dallas.”While beefing up the defensive line makes sense after losing Micah Parsons, the Cowboys’ bigger problem is the secondary. According to Pro Football Focus, the team ranks 32nd in coverage, while pass-rushing efficiency is 17th. Even with high-paid corners like Trevon Diggs (on IR) and DaRon Bland, the secondary remains a glaring weakness that a single trade may not solve. Another challenge has been continuity on defense. Matt Eberflus is Dallas’ third defensive coordinator in three seasons, following Mike Zimmer in 2024 and Dan Quinn prior.“It’s not ideal,” said coach Brian Schottenheimer. “The biggest change was when [Quinn] left. It’s an adjustment, and what people don’t realize is whether you’re playing 3-4 [and] 5-1 with DQ, or [Zimmer’s] four-down, or [Eberflus’] four-down, they’re not the same systems, and they’re not built on the same things.”Even if the Cowboys make a trade, it may only provide a short-term fix while deeper defensive issues remain unresolved.",Dallas cowboys looking for a pass-rusher to boost a struggling defense before the nfl deadline.

Amazon CEO Andy Jassy says that the company’s latest round of layoffs that impacted barely 14,000 people is not because of money or AI. Instead, the real reason behind Amazon job cuts is the culture, Jassy said. “The announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really AI-driven, not right now at least,” he said as quoted by Business Insider. “It really — it's culture.”“And if you grow as fast as we did for several years, the size of businesses, the number of people, the number of locations, the types of businesses you're in, you end up with a lot more people than what you had before, and you end up with a lot more layers,” Jassy explained.“And when that happens, Sometimes, without realizing it, you can weaken the ownership of the people that you have who are doing the actual work,” he added. “And it can lead to slowing you down.”In a blog post dated October 28, Amazon's senior vice president of people experience and technology, Beth Galetti announced that the e-commerce company is “making organizational changes across Amazon that will impact some of our teammates.”“While this will include reducing in some areas and hiring in others, it will mean an overall reduction in our corporate workforce of approximately 14,000 roles,” she said.Amazon’s latest job cuts is the company’s biggest layoff since 2022 when the company laid off 27,000 positions. Jassy’s remarks contradict what Amazon executive has been saying about the job cuts.In the blog post, Beth Galetti explained “This generation of AI is the most transformative technology we’ve seen since the Internet, and it's enabling companies to innovate much faster than ever before (in existing market segments and altogether new ones). We’re convinced that we need to be organized more leanly, with fewer layers and more ownership, to move as quickly as possible for our customers and business.”Separately, Tapas Roy, vice president of device software and services sent a company-wide email this week saying the company is cutting roles within its OS & Services team and asked remaining workers to ""lean in on AI.""","Amazon ceo andy jassy says that the company’s latest round of layoffs that impacted barely 14,000 people is not because of money or ai. “the announcement that we made a few days ago was not really financially driven, and it's not even really ai-driven, not right now at least,” he said.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124986273,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-17580,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

What the companies are saying







YouTube TV subscribers woke up to a blackout of Disney-owned channels including ESPN, ABC, FX and National Geographic after the contract negotiations between Google and Disney failed to reach a new agreement before the deadline of October 30. The blackout of Disney channels on YouTube TV started around midnight ET on October 31, when the previous deal expired. Earlier this week, Disney also warned its subscribers about the potential disruption citing stalled negotiations over pricing. YouTube TV, which charges $82.99/month, said it was unwilling to accept Disney’s proposed rate hikes, calling them unfair to customers.The timing for the blackout of Disney channels couldn’t be worst as it affects the access to college football, NFL, NBA, and NHL games broadcast on ESPN and ABC. Viewers in Florida, for example, will miss the highly anticipated Florida–Georgia rivalry game this Saturday. Disney’s sports networks including ACC Network and SEC Network are also unavailable, leaving fans without coverage of major playoff events and seasonal matchups.The blackout impacts more than 20 channels, including:In addition to live broadcasts, recorded content from Disney networks has also been removed from YouTube TV’s cloud DVR service.Speaking about the issue, YouTube TV issued an official statement saying, “This decision directly harms our subscribers while benefiting their own live TV products, including Hulu + Live TV and Fubo”. On the other hand, Disney still maintains its stance that its pricing reflects the value of its content and the company has also asked the users to explore alternative platforms.Meanwhile, YouTube TV has also promised a credit of $20 to subscribers if the blackout goes on for an extended period of time.","Youtube tv subscribers woke up to a blackout of disney-owned channels including espn, abc, fx and national geographic.

Apple iPhone sales





Apple reported a surprise fall in sales in China. However, much to investors and the company's relief, the fall has not been due to the decline in demand. Apple reportedly blamed the surprise decline in China revenue on supply disruptions. According to a report in Bloomberg, Apple has predicted that the company will return to growth in the world’s biggest smartphone arena as the iPhone 17 gains momentum. Apple CEO Tim Cook said at the earnings call, “It was basically supply constraints that drove the results.” Cook added, “We’re thrilled with what we’re seeing right now.”Apple CEO said that Apple’s store traffic is up significantly in China, and that the latest iPhones -- iPhone 17 series -- has been well received. Cook also said that Apple reached a new high for September-quarter revenue from services in China, while reiterating that the iPhone is doing very well.According to the report, China was a prominent topic during the earning conference, with analysts asking about the region multiple times. The threat of higher tariffs has disrupted global tech supply chain that’s already in flux because of longer-term decisions to diversify away from China.Apple’s total growth projection for the December quarter is between 10% and 12%. Cook, however, didn't specify how much China would contribute to that.Apple has seen stiffer competition from local brands in China. Reports suggest that Huawei Technologies took the top spot in June, as its campaign to reclaim a bigger share of the premium tier resonated with Chinese consumers. Xiaomi too is reported to have made a splash with its Xiaomi 17 series.IDC estimates that 58.6 million iPhones were sold worldwide in the July-September quarter, putting Apple second behind Samsung at 61.4 million of their Android-powered phones sold worldwide in the quarter.In a conference call with analysts, Tim Cook indicated his belief that the iPhone 17 lineup will continue to do well, predicting even more of the devices will be sold during the final three months of the year. “As we head into the holiday season with our most powerful lineup ever, I couldn’t be more excited for what’s to come,” Cook said. Apple expects its iPhone sales to increase at least 10% from last year's holiday season, according to projections provided by Apple's chief financial officer, Kevan Parekh. Total revenue is expected to rise at a similar rate.","Apple reported a surprise fall in sales in china.

In a major push to consolidate its presence in the Indian market, OpenAI has announced that it will offer ChatGPT Go free to all users in India starting November 4. For the uninitiated, ChatGPT Go is OpenAI's mid-tier subscription plan for its AI chatbot ChatGPT. The move targets India, which the company identifies as its second-largest and fastest-growing global market. The year-long complimentary access to ChatGPT Go comes as a direct response to similar aggressive user acquisition tactics by rivals Google and Perplexity. Both companies recently waived fees for their premium AI features to appeal to the vast Indian consumer base.OpenAI's decision follows Google's move to make its AI Pro membership, priced at Rs 19,500$, free for students for a year. Similarly, Perplexity partnered with telecom giant Airtel to offer free access to its premium plan, intensifying the battle for AI market share in the country.ChatGPT Go, which initially launched in India in August at an affordable monthly price of Rs 399, was designed as a bridge between the free tier and the more expensive ChatGPT Plus subscription. The free ChatGPT Go tier will provide Indian users with significant benefits, including: Higher message limits; Increased daily image generation and uploads; Longer memory for more personalized and context-aware responses"".Since launching ChatGPT Go in India a few months ago, the adoption and creativity we've seen from users has been inspiring,"" said Nick Turley, Vice President and Head of ChatGPT, in a statement.

Control of Tesla is at stake in vote on Elon Musk's pay plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us/control-of-tesla-is-at-stake-in-vote-on-elon-musks-pay-plan/articleshow/125072569.cms,"A Tesla dealership in Las Vegas, March 29, 2025.





Tesla's shareholders will decide this week whether the automaker should award its CEO, Elon Musk, stock worth almost $1 trillion if he achieves a series of impossible-sounding goals.But there are big questions about how tough those goals really are.Musk would acquire voting control over nearly 29% of Tesla shares if he met all of the targets in a 10-year performance plan. Among other things, the company would have to deploy 1 million humanlike robots and boost its stock market value to $8.5 trillion from $1.4 trillion today.That sounds difficult. But the plan would also allow Tesla's board of directors to grant Musk a portion of the shares even if he fell short. Some corporate governance experts said the board, which includes Musk's brother and several long-standing friends and business associates, could award him shares regardless of his performance.""These are not independent decision-makers,"" said Dorothy Lund, a professor at Columbia Law School who teaches and writes about corporate governance.She cited a Delaware court decision that struck down a previous pay plan for Musk in part because the judge found that many Tesla directors were too close to him personally or owed their wealth to him.Tesla has criticized that decision as violating the will of Tesla shareholders, who approved the earlier plan by large margins twice. The Delaware Supreme Court is expected to rule soon on the company's appeal.Tesla's board is ""very active, very independent, and I think the outside world doesn't appreciate it,"" Robyn Denholm, the board's chair, said in a September interview with The New York Times.Supporters of Musk said the board should have some leeway in awarding shares because markets and technology could change. They also contend that they don't believe that he would be given shares he had not truly earned.""I don't see that as a big concern,"" said Andrew Rocco, a stock strategist at Zacks Investment Research. ""As controversial as Musk is, he sets big goals, and in time he attains these goals and surpasses them.""Denholm said there were no escape clauses for a key part of the plan that would require Musk to raise Tesla's stock price by 500%. ""Market capitalization -- the market's verdict on real value -- can't be 'gamed' through aggressive pricing or other tactics to create illusory growth,"" she said in a letter to shareholders.Tesla, Musk and their critics have been waging contentious campaigns before the company's annual meeting on Thursday. The fight has distinct echoes of the hostility that characterizes American politics. Musk's right-wing politics appear to be at play, too, with state pension managers in states governed by Democrats, like California and New York, opposing the pay plan and those in Republican-run states, like Florida, supporting it.Even Pope Leo XIV has weighed in, citing Musk's pay as an example of the gap between rich and poor. ""If that is the only thing that has value anymore, then we're in big trouble,"" he told Crux, a Roman Catholic news site, this summer.Musk and his critics are agreed on one thing -- this is a fight over how much influence he has over Tesla. Musk has said he is more interested in greater voting control than in money. After taxes, his stake would be around 25%. While that is well short of a majority, in practice it would be very difficult to pass measures he opposed.""I don't think it's an overstatement to say that it would revive the era of robber barons who wielded near-absolute control,"" Brad Lander, the New York City comptroller, said during a conference call organized by SOC Investment Group, an organization associated with labor unions that opposes Musk's compensation plan.Tesla's board sees the plan as a way to motivate him as he transforms the company from primarily selling electric cars to making robots and self-driving taxis.The board points to Musk's achievements. Tesla is the only profitable U.S. electric carmaker. His admirers in and out of the company see him as the only person who can deliver products that usher in ""sustainable abundance.""But Tesla's robots and self-driving cars may not generate significant revenue, let alone profits, for years. Skeptics say some of his promises, including that Tesla robots could care for children or perform surgery, are far-fetched.Musk told investors and analysts in October that he needed to have strong influence over the ""robot army"" that Tesla would build. His supporters interpreted that as a desire to prevent control from falling into the wrong hands.""Control of Tesla could affect the future of civilization,"" Musk said on X, his social media platform.Visions of futuristic products are central to Tesla's lofty stock-market valuation, said John Paul MacDuffie, a professor of management at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania who focuses on transportation. Wall Street values Tesla at more than four times the value of Toyota Motor, the world's largest car company by sales.""Musk has persuaded some investors that everyone is going to be in a robotaxi,"" MacDuffie said. ""I don't buy it.""For Musk to collect the whole package, which is broken into 12 parts, Tesla would have to achieve milestones like selling 10 million subscriptions to self-driving software and increasing earnings before depreciation and other items to $400 billion from $17 billon last year.""He doesn't get any compensation if he doesn't deliver,"" Denholm said during the Times interview at Tesla's California offices.She said Musk required enormous compensation because he was driven to do things ""that no one else has done before, doing things that further humankind.""But the board could give him some of the shares if it determined that he had missed a product target because of natural disasters, war, interference by government regulators or other, unspecified circumstances.It would be possible ""for Mr. Musk to earn at least the first three tranches of the award without meeting a single operational milestone,"" according to a report by Glass Lewis, a firm that advises investors on shareholder votes. Each tranche includes stock worth tens of billions of dollars.Glass Lewis and ISS Stoxx, another advisory firm, recently recommended that investors reject the pay package. During a conference call last month, Musk accused the firms of ""corporate terrorism.""Tesla said in a letter to shareholders that the firms' opinions were flawed. ""Their analysis cannot distinguish between innovation and risk, or between ambition and mismanagement,"" the company said.ISS declined to comment on Musk's remark. Glass Lewis said in a statement that it offered ""informed analysis and recommendations to our clients worldwide.""Tesla's board has created a website to promote the pay plan and has run video ads on social media. Musk has posted about the shareholder vote more than 60 times in recent months.The intensity of the campaign reflects the board's eagerness to win the vote by a wide margin to mute criticism, said Ann Lipton, a professor of corporate governance at the University of Colorado School of Law.Many analysts expect the plan to pass because Musk is allowed to vote his own shares in Texas, where the company moved its incorporation after losing the Delaware case on his earlier pay package. He controls about 15% of the total. But if the new pay package secures fewer than half of shares owned by outside investors, it could hurt Tesla's reputation, Lipton said during the SOC conference call.""The mythology of Elon Musk kind of depends on the perception that he has the continuing devotion of Tesla shareholders,"" she said.Tesla's board said in a statement that the intensity of its campaign ""is being driven by the significance of this election to the future of Tesla"" and the need to reach smaller investors who collectively own a lot of the company's stock.Investors will vote on other important measures, including an investor's proposal that calls for Tesla to invest in xAI, Musk's privately held artificial intelligence company. The board has taken no position on that measure, but Musk favors it.Shareholders will also vote on a proposal by Thomas DiNapoli, the New York state comptroller, to eliminate a restriction on shareholder lawsuits. After moving its corporate domicile to Texas, Tesla took advantage of a state law allowing it to ban suits by shareholders who own less than 3% of the company. Only a few investment funds meet that threshold.Tesla's board maintains that the restriction protects the company from suits by people who don't represent the views of a significant number of shareholders.Investors can still band together to clear that threshold, the board said in a regulatory filing. DiNapoli, who oversees a pension fund that owns about $1.5 billion in Tesla stock, said that was impractical and wants any shareholder to be able to sue.Denholm warned shareholders in a letter last week that if they rejected the pay plan, Musk might quit. ""We run the risk that he gives up his executive position, and Tesla may lose his time, talent and vision.""To Musk's supporters, threatening to walk is a normal way to negotiate. But Randall Peterson, a professor at London Business School who studies corporate boards, said the dependence on a single executive was a red flag.""The graveyards are filled with indispensable men,"" Peterson said.","Tesla's shareholders will decide this week whether the automaker should award its ceo, elon musk, stock worth almost $1 trillion. Musk would acquire voting control over nearly 29% of tesla shares if he met all of the targets in a 10-year performance plan.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125072628,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-656220,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Rowling, who has long been accused of making transphobic comments.@Wensoing later urged players to ask Epic Games to cancel the crossover, saying: “If you feel frustrated about this, I recommend directing these frustrations towards the official Fortnite account, this is the best way to make your voice heard.”While scrolling through X, Nick Eh 30 reportedly saw these posts and decided to remove them from his feed.He was heard saying in a clip, “What is this, bro? I’m removing this guy. Holy crap.” His action quickly went viral. Soon, many users began calling him out for “being transphobic,” saying he should have handled the situation differently instead of deleting posts.One user, @FuellFire, wrote, “Guy who claims to be ‘family friendly’ and ‘spread good vibes’ being transphobic.” Others joined in with harsh words like “@NickEh30 F**k you, you transphobe,” posted by @P0wer_Vizi0n, and “Transphobia sucks + We don’t want Harry Potter,” from @goroakechiboba.Some users mocked his content, calling it “mid ahh content tailored to children anyway,” while another post from @renegaderelic0 read, “‘Never back down’ until it’s time to call out a billion-dollar company for collaborating with a transphobe.”Also Read: Sneako Calls Out Erika Kirk For Her Viral Hug With JD Vance And Her Bold Charlie Kirk Comparison Even with the ongoing criticism, Nick Eh 30 kept streaming and posting updates.

'What The Hell Are You Doing?': Obama Talks MAGA, Then Torches 'CLUELESS' Trump





Former First Lady Michelle Obama complained how she had to navigate 'white hot glare' as a Black First Lady as she was discussing her new book 'The Look' on ABC News. “We were all too aware that as a first black couple, we couldn’t afford any missteps. And that as a black woman, I was under a particularly white hot glare,” Michelle wrote in her book.During the interview, when she was asked particularly about her phrase 'white hot glare', Michelle Obama said, ""You can't afford to get anything wrong because you didn't get the ...at least until the country came to know us, we didn't get the grace that I think some other families have gotten.""“Making a mistake in a political environment where you’re the first and people are where your opponents are using your race as a fear-based strategy to make you seem like the other, then everything matters,” she said.The Look is co-authored by Michelle with her stylist and speaks about Michelle's fashion choices. She said she was apprehensive about discussing fashion when she was the First Lady and there were more important things at that time but now that the public knows her and her work, she feels comfortable speaking about the 'soft power'.“We live in a culture, sadly, where, you know, if somebody wants to go after a woman, the first thing they do is go after our looks, our size, our physical being, as a way to, you know, make us feel small, to keep us in place,” Michelle said.But her complaint did not go down well with social media users who pointed out that the Obamas have been the most celebrated First Family and Michelle Obama has been on the cover of Vogue thrice.""I am sad to announce that we have once again disappointed the Obamas,"" one wrote. ""What modern first family has received more grace than the Obamas?"" Senator Mike Lee asked.","Michelle obama said she did not get the grace of the people as the first lady until people got to know about them. “we were all too aware that as a first black couple, we couldn’t afford any missteps,” michelle wrote in her book.

Guggenheim Museum in New York. (AP Photo, File)





LONDON: For sale: The world's most valuable toilet, a lavatory literally worth its weight in gold. Sotheby's announced Friday it will auction off the solid gold cistern, a sculpture by Italian artist Maurizio Cattelan entitled ""America. ""The auction house calls it an ""incisive commentary on the collision of artistic production and commodity value."" It's also a fully functional toilet, identical to one that gained global fame when it was stolen in an audacious heist from England's Blenheim Palace in 2019.The starting price at the Nov 18 auction in New York will be the price of the just over 101.2kg of gold used to make it - about $10 million.David Galperin, head of contemporary art at Sotheby's in New York, said Cattelan is ""the consummate art world provocateur."" He's also one of most successful, an artist whose work ""Comedian,"" a banana duct-taped to a wall, sold at a New York auction last year for $6.2 million. ""Him"" - Cattelan's unsettling sculpture of a kneeling Adolf Hitler - sold for $17.2 million at a Christie's auction in 2016.The artist has said ""America"" satirises excessive wealth.""Whatever you eat, a $200 lunch or a $2 hot dog, the results are the same, toilet-wise,"" he once said.Two versions of ""America"" were created in 2016. The one being sold has been owned by an unnamed collector since 2017. The other version went on display in a bathroom at the Guggenheim Museum in New York in 2016. More than 100,000 visitors queued up to - to put it delicately - interact with the work.The Guggenheim offered the work to US President Donald Trump during his first term in office after he had asked to borrow a Van Gogh painting.In 2019, it went on show at Blenheim Palace, the English country manor that was the birthplace of Winston Churchill. Within days, it was stolen by burglars who broke into the building, forcibly wrenched it from the plumbing, and fled. Two men were convicted earlier this year and jailed. The toilet has never been recovered. Investigators think it was likely broken up and melted down.Galperin is unwilling to speculate on how much ""America"" could sell for. He notes that Cattelan's duct-taped banana posed questions about ""how one assigns value to something that has, in essence, no value aside from its authorship and its conceptual idea.""'America' is in many ways the complete inverse of that. It is a perfect foil in that this work has a lot of intrinsic value in a way that most artworks do not,"" he said ""The question of the proportion of value between the raw materials and the artistic idea is very on the table here.""""America"" will go on display at Sotheby's new New York headquarters, the Breuer Building, from Nov 8 until the auction. It will be in a bathroom, and visitors will be able to see it up close and personal.At Guggenheim and Blenheim Palace, the toilet was connected to the plumbing system and visitors could book a 3-minute appointment to use it. This time, visitors won't be able to use it - they can look, but they can't flush.","Sotheby's will auction off the solid gold cistern, a sculpture by italian artist maurizio cattelan entitled ""america"" it's also a fully functional toilet, identical to one that gained global fame when it was stolen in an audacious heist from england's blenheim palace in 2019.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-125008566,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-65280,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

UAE telecom operator Du jumps into bitcoin mining

What does Cloud Miner offer?

Step-by-step: Subscribing to Cloud Miner

Step 1: Get Ready to Bid the initial contracts are made available through an online auction hosted at the designated platform. You must be a UAE resident with a verified ID to participate.

Step 2: Participate in the Auction Bidding for the limited-capacity 24-month contracts runs for a specified period (The initial window was November 3 to 9). You will need to secure a contract through this process to gain access to the service.

Step 3: Account Verification (KYC/AML) To ensure regulatory compliance and security, du requires a strict verification process for all high-value transactions:

UAE Pass: Access to the platform requires verification through your official UAE Pass digital identity. This ensures adherence to local Know Your Customer (KYC) and Anti-Money Laundering (AML) standards. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Mandatory 2FA is required for all account access, bolstering your security.

Step 4: Commence Mining Once your subscription is secured, your account is verified, and the fixed fees are paid, your cloud mining operation begins immediately from du's secure data centers in the UAE. You receive Bitcoin rewards based on the rented computational power.

What residents should weigh before signing up?

Costs vs rewards: Cloud mining reduces setup costs but fees, uptime, and pool efficiency affect returns read the fee and payout formulas closely.



Payout mechanics: Payouts are reported to be in Bitcoin and routed to users’ wallets ensure you have a compatible wallet and understand tax/reporting requirements in your emirate.

Contract terms & refunds: Check contract length, maintenance fees, and what happens if network difficulty rises or BTC price changes.

Security & trust: Using a large incumbent (du) gives more operational transparency than anonymous cloud-mining sites, but always verify service terms and regulatory disclosures.

Why is this interesting?





Want to mine Bitcoin without the drama of hardware, heat or high bills? UAE residents can now click, subscribe and start earning BTC - no tech skills needed. Du 's new Cloud Miner service, the UAE's first official Cloud Mining as a Service (MaaS) offering from a telecom company, has made Bitcoin mining accessible and compliant for residents.This guide breaks down exactly what the service is, how to get started, and the key benefits of this regulated opportunity.MaaS stands for Mining as a Service. It's a business model that dramatically simplifies the process of cryptocurrency mining, particularly for digital assets like Bitcoin.In a MaaS model, a provider (like Du, with its Cloud Miner) owns and operates all the necessary, specialized mining hardware. They maintain the equipment, manage the high electricity consumption, and ensure the entire operation remains compliant and connected to the blockchain. Essentially, Cloud Miner allows UAE residents to participate in Bitcoin mining by simply subscribing to the output of a professional mining operation, making it an easy-to-digest investment product rather than a technical endeavor.The digital finance landscape in the UAE just got a major upgrade.Telecom giant Du has officially launched a new, revolutionary platform called Cloud Miner, offering residents a straightforward way to participate in the booming world of Bitcoin mining. Revealed on November 2, 2025, during a high-profile launch event at the Burj Khalifa, this service marks a massive first: it is the initial official Cloud Mining as a Service (MaaS) offering from a UAE company.Cloud Miner is a “mining-as-a-service” product under du’s du Tech arm. Each contract sells a fixed amount of hashing power (plans start at 250 terahashes per second (TH/s)), and the mining results are paid out directly in Bitcoin to users’ crypto wallets. du runs the hardware, handles electricity and technical management, and shares the mined Bitcoin with subscribers according to the capacity they hold. This removes the need for users to buy ASIC rigs, arrange power, or manage complex cooling and maintenance.This move is exclusive to UAE residents and instantly expands the digital options available to those looking to grow their investment portfolio within a fully transparent and locally compliant framework. It aligns perfectly with the country’s push to develop robust digital asset and blockchain infrastructure.The initial phase of securing a Cloud Miner contract is done through a specific online process, designed for UAE residents only.A mainstream telecom offering cloud mining lowers the entry barrier for ordinary UAE residents and signals the UAE’s continued push to integrate digital-asset services into mainstream infrastructure, while also highlighting the need to follow local rules about where mining can physically operate.","Uae residents gain easy access to regulated bitcoin cloud mining.

What Caused the Internet to React So Strongly to RaKai’s Halloween Costume?

White Chicks,

RaKai reacts to critics: What came out during the November 2 livestream?





Popular livestreamer RaKai, also known online as ""2xRaKai,"" has found himself at the centre of another online controversy following his 2025 Halloween broadcast. During the livestream, RaKai’s makeup and attire drew sharp reactions from fans and viewers.Clips from the broadcast quickly circulated on platforms like X and Reddit, with many calling his choice “white-face” and questioning whether the costume crossed the line from playful Halloween impersonation into a sensitive cultural misstep.While some fans saw the outfit as harmless fun and a nod to pop culture, others criticized it as tone-deaf, reflecting the ongoing challenges that livestream personalities face when balancing humor, audience engagement, and social responsibility in the digital age.The response to RaKai’s costume, inspired by the 2004 comedy filmhas been divided. Some viewers defended the streamer's creative freedom, pointing out the humorous intent and pop culture reference behind his look. Others, however, expressed outrage, noting the broader implications of race and representation online.John Tectone, another streamer, addressed the controversy on social media: “Druski and Rakai can do white face, it’s funny.But it’s cringe af that the two white girls who did black face are getting doxxed and death threats.” This highlights the ongoing double standards and sensitivities around racial impersonation, particularly in livestream and social media culture.On November 2, RaKai addressed the backlash directly during a live broadcast, showing little remorse for the criticism. The 16-year-old expressed frustration over criticism of his Halloween costume, which involved wearing whiteface. He argued that people will always find reasons to be critical, stating that they have the right to dress as anyone they choose for Halloween.RaKai emphasized that negativity is inevitable, saying that some people are “always just hating” regardless of one’s actions. He also encouraged his audience to affirm this sentiment, urging them to respond with “Period,” underscoring their belief that this perspective is indisputable.This incident adds to RaKai’s turbulent year, following multiple bans from Twitch, including one in June 2025 for live-streamed reckless driving . The controversy underscores how creators in livestream culture are increasingly navigating the fine line between attention-grabbing content, audience engagement, and public accountability. As digital culture evolves, RaKai’s situation reflects the broader tension between entertainment, freedom of expression, and cultural sensitivity in online spaces.Also read: Dezz VS RaKai controversy: sparks outrage after homophobic F-slur at RaKai during Kai Cenat's Mafiathon 3","Popular livestreamer rakai, also known online as ""2xrakai,"" has found himself at the centre of another online controversy following his 2025 halloween broadcast.

Twitch streamer and TikToker Nina Lin has spoken out after two viral videos showed her behaving inappropriately toward FaZe Silky’s assistant, Said, and streamer Jeremy “Disguised Toast. ” The first clip, from October 22, 2025, showed Nina Lin appearing to grab Said while another creator, Zoe Spencer, danced beside him. They were later seen carrying Said and putting him in bed.Days later, on October 28, another video spread online that showed Nina giving Disguised Toast a tapotement-style massage, which viewers called inappropriate.

Asmongold calls out Mizkif’s community for Reddit brigading and reacts to leaked Discord messages from October 2025

Streamer Tectone supports Asmongold’s claim about Mizkif’s online brigading





Twitch and Kick streamer Zack “Asmongold” Hoyt has accused Matthew “Mizkif” Rinaudo and his fans of brigading on social media. On November 2, 2025, a 1-minute-32-second clip from Asmongold’s Just Chatting stream was shared on X. In it, he talked about Mizkif’s community allegedly making fake or coordinated posts on Reddit, especially on r/LivestreamFail.Asmongold said he believes Mizkif’s fans “brigade Reddit like crazy,” adding that the pattern of overly positive posts in smaller subreddits looks fake. He said it’s “obvious” that some of the online support Mizkif gets is not real.During the same stream, Asmongold also looked at a post on r/emiru that showed Mizkif’s alleged Discord messages from October 11, 2025. He said if the leaked messages are true and if they came from Mizkif’s moderators, then “it’s obvious they’re brigading.”He added that if anyone sees positive Reddit posts about Mizkif with “20 to 100 upvotes,” they’re “probably fake.” Asmongold said:“No, I think that he does. I think that he brigades Reddit. I think his community brigades like crazy… It’s obvious that it is inauthentic.”Asmongold also mentioned that the situation might make it hard for Mizkif’s team to keep doing it “considering what’s going on now.”He stressed that he wasn’t accusing Mizkif of “viewbotting,” but specifically of manipulating Reddit posts.Streamer John “Tectone” DeLise, known for his Gacha game streams, reacted soon after. He posted on X, saying:“Hey, it’s that thing that I’ve been saying for 3 years that I got s**t for.”Tectone said he’s been talking about this same issue for years and agreed with Asmongold’s take. His response showed that other creators have noticed the same pattern around Mizkif’s community.Also Read: YouTuber Kyle Kulinski Sparks Backlash After Meme On Erika Kirk Amid JD Vance Viral Moment And Resurfaced Charlie Kirk Photo Online As of now, Mizkif has not responded to Asmongold or Tectone’s statements.
