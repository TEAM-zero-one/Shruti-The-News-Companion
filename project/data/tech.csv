‘Two-eyed’ NISAR satellite will scan every piece of Earth,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/two-eyed-nisar-satellite-will-scan-every-piece-of-earth/articleshow/123005655.cms,"Nasa's deputy associate administrator Casey Swails, in presence of Isro chairman V Narayanan, addresses scientists after successful launch of GSLV-F16

NEW DELHI: The NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar (NISAR) programme cost the US and India over $1.5 billion. But there is an important question to be asked: What was the need for such a huge investment when hundreds of earth observation satellites are already in space? The answer is that the world had never developed a dual-frequency band satellite.NISAR has two synthetic aperture radars of different bands that will operate in tandem. It will be a ‘satellite with two eyes in space” keeping a hawk’s eye on the Earth and scanning every piece of our planet for minute details.“Our planet surface undergoes constant and meaningful change. Some change happens slowly. Some happens abruptly. Some changes are large, while some are subtle,” Karen St Germain, director of Nasa's Earth Science division, explained. Calling NISAR “the most sophisticated radar we've ever built and a model for the next generation of Earth-observation capabilities”, Germain said, “We'll see land substance and swelling, movement, deformation and melting of mountain glaciers and ice sheets covering both Greenland and Antarctica, and, of course, we'll see wildfires”.It's “a first-of-its-kind, jewel radar satellite that will change the way we study our home planet and better predict a natural disaster before it strikes,” Nasa’s science mission chief Nicky Fox said ahead of liftoff.Congratulating Isro and Nasa, space minister Jitendra Singh called the NISAR mission a “game changer in precise management of disasters”.Provided by Nasa, the L-band SAR, uses higher wavelength microwaves and can penetrate tree cover for vegetation, sand and ice. It will capture tiny details of surface undulations and see through dense forest cover. The S-band SAR, provided by Isro, which has a shorter wavelength, will capture larger features like crop fields and water bodies.L-band and S-band SARs together will give a comprehensive picture of the observed area — generating detailed imagery that is not possible even by integrating data of two separate satellites with different bands. Putting two radars of different bands on the same satellite was therefore the biggest engineering challenge for both Nasa and Isro, which they finally managed to overcome, though it took them 10 years to develop the 2,392-kg marvel.Equipped with a 12-metre dish that will unfold in space, NISAR will record nearly all of Earth's land and ice twice every 12 days from an altitude of 747 km.By noticing these tiny changes in the vertical movement of the Earth's surface — as little as 1 cm (0.4 inches) — scientists will be able to detect precursors to natural and human-caused disasters, from earthquakes, landslides and volcanoes to aging infrastructure like dams and bridges.The data from NISAR will be turned into three-dimensional maps that will not only help scientists and policymakers respond to natural disasters but also assist farmers by monitoring soil moisture and crop growth.Indian space industry representative Anil Prakash, DG, SatCom Industry Association (SIA-India), hailed the NISAR mission and Indo-US space collaboration. ""The successful Nasa-Isro collaboration on the $1.5 billion NISAR mission marks a defining moment in global space diplomacy. It brings together cutting-edge American L-band SAR systems and India’s expertise in engineering, integration, and cost-effective launch capability via GSLV-F16,” Prakash said. ""Isro’s contribution, including the S-band radar, satellite bus, launch services, and mission operations, once again demonstrates India’s ability to build and deliver complex systems with remarkable reliability. With a legacy of over 400 international satellite launches, Isro has emerged not just as a collaborator, but as a co-architect of next-generation Earth science missions,” he added.",Nisar has two synthetic aperture radars of different bands that will operate in tandem.

Thinking Machines Lab: a startup with billion-dollar belief

Why Murati’s team said no to Meta

A name to watch in AI’s future





Mira Murati, the Albanian-American tech visionary behind some of the most significant breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, is once again in the spotlight—this time for turning down an eye-watering $1 billion offer from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg . As the former CTO of OpenAI and now the founder of the AI startup Thinking Machines Lab, Murati has become one of the most influential figures in the global AI race. Her team's unanimous rejection of Meta’s massive offer speaks volumes about their confidence in her leadership and their belief in the startup’s long-term vision.Before launching Thinking Machines Lab, Mira Murati served as the chief technology officer at OpenAI, one of the most influential positions in the modern AI world. During her tenure, she played a pivotal role in leading the development of groundbreaking technologies such as ChatGPT, DALL·E, and Codex—systems that have since transformed the way people interact with artificial intelligence. Her work helped bring generative AI into the mainstream, sparking a global wave of innovation across industries from education and healthcare to design and coding.Murati wasn’t just a technical leader—she was a strategic visionary. At OpenAI, she emphasized the importance of safety, alignment, and responsible development, pushing the organization to think deeply about the societal impact of powerful AI systems.Internally, she earned the reputation of being the “AI brain” behind OpenAI’s most ambitious projects, praised for her calm, focused demeanor and her ability to guide multidisciplinary teams through intense periods of innovation. Her combination of engineering precision and human-centered thinking set the stage for her next bold move: founding her own AI company.In early 2025, she delivered a keynote at the World Economic Forum in Davos, warning that “AI without values is intelligence without conscience,” sparking international dialogue on AI ethics and sovereignty. She’s also been advising the European Commission on emerging AI regulatory frameworks, a rare role for a startup founder.Founded in early 2025, Thinking Machines Lab has rapidly emerged as one of the most-watched AI startups. Despite not launching a single product yet, the company recently raised a stunning $2 billion seed round at a valuation nearing $12 billion, led by Andreessen Horowitz. The startup’s goal: to create customizable, interpretable, and widely accessible AI systems that could redefine the AI landscape. Industry insiders say the company’s stealth mode only adds to its mystique. With Murati at the helm, expectations are sky-high for what comes next.According to a Wired report, Zuckerberg's Meta offered some of Murati’s team members compensation packages ranging from $200 million to $1 billion to join its newly launched Superintelligence Lab. But every single offer was turned down. Sources say the Thinking Machines Lab team believes their equity in the startup has the potential to be worth far more—and more importantly, they value their independence and Murati’s vision over big-tech paychecks.In a tech industry where massive paydays often drive decisions, the loyalty displayed by Murati’s team stands out. The rejection of Meta’s lucrative offers highlights their belief in the startup’s mission and long-term potential. Many observers also note that the chance to help shape AI’s future from the ground up, without the constraints of a corporate giant, is a rare and meaningful opportunity—one Murati has worked hard to create.Mira Murati’s leadership has already been recognized worldwide—she was featured in Time’s 100 Most Influential People in AI (2024) and Fortune’s 100 Most Powerful Women in Business (2023). With Thinking Machines Lab gaining momentum and Meta's billion-dollar offers rebuffed, Murati has solidified her place not just as a builder of AI—but as a shaper of its future.",Mira murati is the founder of ai startup thinking machines lab.

But one day prior to that, the dataminers already leaked the highly anticipated rare cards for Ho-Oh EX (3-Star) and Lugia EX (3-Star). And this is where all the controversy began.The community noticed that the design of the Ho-Oh card holds uncanny similarities with a 2021 fan artwork by Chinese artists Ianjiujiu. This comparison sparked serious altercations as if the company used this design unintentionally or it didn’t care to take any permission at all.Even the artist himself went on to share a side-by-side comparison tweet of his work and the new Ho-Oh EX card in the game.It didn’t take too long for Pokemon TCG Pocket to acknowledge its mistake as the official Twitter handle of the game has recently shared its response regarding the ongoing controversy. It says this is actually aby the card production team and it provided, which happened to be the artwork by Ianjiujiu.The company also stated that both Ho-Oh EX and Lugia EX had been replaced by temporary placeholder cards displayingThere has been no problem with the design of Lugia EX but as its animation featured Ho-Oh as part of a shared mural. So, Lugia’s design was also removed as well. It is ensured by the company that it will conduct a broader investigation so that no similar issues ever exist elsewhere in the game.If it was any other card, there wouldn’t have been this much controversy as Pokemon TCG Pocket would have pulled them out from the game. But both Ho-Oh EX and Lugia EX are one of the rarest cards in the game and both share each other’s Immersive Art Animation. That’s why this situation escalated so high.","The wisdom of sea and sky expansion has dropped on july 30, 2025, in pokemon tcg pocket.

Small business boom expected as AI democratises enterprise tools



Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff rejects the predictions of widespread job displacement from artificial intelligence , arguing that AI agents augment rather than replace human workers, even as his company automates up to 50% of internal work through AI technology. Speaking to Fortune during a recent London visit, Benioff directly challenged prominent AI executives like Anthropic's Dario Amodei who have warned of massive white-collar job losses. ""I keep looking around, talking to CEOs, asking: what AI are they using for these big layoffs?"" Benioff said. ""I think AI augments people, but I don't know if it necessarily replaces them.""The tech CEO’s comments come as Salesforce has emerged as the most aggressive adopter of AI agents in corporate America, with the technology now handling 85% of customer service inquiries and qualifying sales leads 40% faster than human workers.Despite the dramatic efficiency gains, Marc Benioff emphasised AI's limitations prevent complete automation. ""The thing about the AI we have, it's not 100% accurate because it's built on word models,"" he explained to Fortune. ""When you add in our data set, we're getting 90% accuracy, but it's not 100%. So you need the human in the loop.""This accuracy gap has practical implications across industries. ""Every AI needs its own fact checker, and those fact checkers are humans, not AIs, because AIs can't fact check because they don't have that level of accuracy,"" Marc Benioff noted.The Salesforce CEO described his relationship with AI as a partnership, using it to review business plans and identify gaps in strategic thinking. ""Every AI needs its own fact checker, and those fact checkers are humans, not AIs,"" Benioff concluded, reinforcing his view that human oversight remains indispensable in an AI-augmented workplace.Rather than mass unemployment, Benioff predicts AI will spawn new business creation . ""There's going to potentially be a lot more employment because everybody is augmented and has the ability to do more,"" he told Fortune. ""I think there's going to be an explosion of small and medium businesses because they can do more, it's easier to start one, you can create value more easily.""While Salesforce has frozen hiring for engineers, support staff, and lawyers, the company continues recruiting salespeople and customer success employees to help clients adopt AI technology.","Salesforce ceo marc benioff rejects the predictions of widespread job displacement from artificial intelligence.

GTA 6 may again witness a delay



Grand Theft Auto VI expected to generate nearly $8 billion



Rockstar Games’ much-awaited title Grand Theft Auto VI (GTA6) may again witness a delay. According to a new online leak the game may release in September 2026 instead of May 2026. As reported by Tom’s Guide, leakster Millie A has revealed that due to some internal discussions at the studio, the release of GTA 6 is said to shift from May 2026 to September 2026. This news comes after Rockstar had already pushed back the game's launch from its initial Fall 2025 window to May 2026. While Rockstar Games has yet to officially comment on these latest speculations. Along with this, the leakster also revealed the likely price of GTA 6 in the UK.The rumours stem from an X (formerly Twitter) user and leaker known as ""Millie A,"" who, despite a mixed track record, claims that ""internal talks"" at Rockstar Games point to a possible slip in the release schedule. Earlier, the gaming studio confirmed that the GTA 6 will launch in May 2026, however as per the new leak the game launch has witnessed another delay and now it may launch in September 2026.In addition to the potential delay, the leak also offered insights into the alleged pricing structure for GTA 6's various editions:* Standard Edition: Reportedly priced at $69.99/£69.99.* Deluxe Edition: Expected to cost $89.99/£89.99, potentially offering early access to GTA Online.* Premium Edition: Priced at $109.99/£109.99, rumoured to provide ""first access"" to GTA Online.The prospect of early access to GTA Online for pricier editions suggests a strategy by Rockstar to incentivize higher-tier purchases, leveraging the immense popularity and profitability of GTA 5's online component.Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA 6) is set to launch in May next year. Meanwhile, investment firm Konvoy has made some major predictions for the upcoming open world title’s financial performance. The video game venture capitalist company suggests that GTA 6 will generate $7.6 billion in revenue within just two months or 60 days of its release. Josh Chapman, a managing partner of Konvoy, shared this forecast on a post shared on the professional networking site LinkedIn. He highlighted that the firm believes that the highly anticipated game will have major commercial success. However, it's important to note that Konvoy's projection is based on certain assumptions that Take-Two Interactive has not yet confirmed, such as an $80 price point for the game and a reported budget of around $2 billion, which the company is said to have spent to develop the game.Konvoy's analysis suggests that GTA 6 could recover its estimated $2 billion budget in under 30 days and build considerable momentum. The firm predicts that it may become the gaming industry’s biggest launch to date and is expected to break records for both copies sold and revenue generated by a game.

YouTube sensation Jimmy Donaldson, better known as MrBeast, has set a historic milestone by becoming the first individual creator to surpass 400 million subscribers on his main channel. According to Forbes report, world’s richest content creator MrBeast’s position achieved on June 1, 2025, this feat cements as one of the most influential digital creators worldwide. To celebrate, YouTube awarded him a unique Play Button trophy, specially designed to mark this unprecedented achievement. However, while fans praised his incredible success, the trophy design sparked controversy online, with many calling it uninspired and even “AI-generated” in appearance. The debate has raised questions about YouTube’s creativity in its awards, overshadowing what is otherwise one of the biggest milestones in digital content history.MrBeast’s channel, known for its large-scale challenges, philanthropy, and viral social experiments, has dominated YouTube for years. Surpassing 400 million subscribers places him far ahead of T-Series, which currently holds 299 million. Celebrating the milestone, MrBeast shared an emotional note, recalling how he was once discouraged from pursuing content creation:“A decade ago everyone told me I was too obsessed and would never make it.I loved making content so much I told my mom I’d rather be homeless than do anything else. Thanks to YouTube and you guys, I now have a purpose every single day.”To celebrate the milestone, YouTube CEO Neal Mohan personally handed MrBeast a custom-designed Play Button. Unlike traditional Gold or Diamond buttons, this award features a metallic frame with a rare blue gemstone centerpiece, symbolizing the uniqueness of this achievement. MrBeast proudly shared the picture of his award with the caption:This marks the first time YouTube has created a personalised award for an individual creator, underscoring how MrBeast has become the face of creator culture worldwide.While fans praised MrBeast’s achievement, many were critical of the trophy’s design. Some argued it looked like a repainted version of previous awards, while others felt YouTube could have made something more iconic. A Reddit user commented: “This looks like they made one just for the sake of it.”Another added: “It’s just a 10 million button with a blue center.”A few fans defended YouTube, pointing out that the blue centerpiece might be crafted from precious materials like lapis lazuli or azurite, but the overall sentiment leaned toward disappointment, with some calling it “AI-generated” in design.MrBeast is more than a YouTuber; he is a global entrepreneur. Earlier this year, Celebrity Net Worth estimated his wealth at $1 billion, making him the eighth-youngest billionaire in the world and the only one under 30 to achieve such status without inheritance. His business empire, Beast Industries, generated $473 million in 2024 alone and is expected to double in revenue this year. Alongside his core YouTube content, MrBeast runs multiple businesses, including food chains, gaming channels, merchandise, and tech ventures, making him one of the most influential digital entrepreneurs of this generation.","Jimmy donaldson, better known as mrbeast, has set a historic milestone by becoming the first individual creator to surpass 400 million subscribers on his main channel.

"China push: In Nepal, EVs now account for 76% of all vehicles sold",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/south-asia/china-push-in-nepal-evs-now-account-for-76-of-all-vehicles-sold/articleshow/122960428.cms,"



KATHMANDU: The narrow streets of Kathmandu - sized for pedestrians and rickshaws - are choked with engines. Buses, motorbikes, small trucks and taxis fill the sprawling valley with horns and exhaust. For its more than 3 million residents, just getting around is a dangerous, eye-stinging ordeal.But recently, a new kind of motor has started to ease the crush. Sleek electric vehicles glide by with a quiet hum. Gleaming showrooms do a brisk business in the latest models, and charging stations on highways have turned into rest stops with cafes for drivers. Over the past year, EVs accounted for 76% of all passenger vehicles and half of the light commercial vehicles sold in Nepal. Five years ago, that number was essentially zero. The EV market share in Nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including Norway, Singapore and Ethiopia. The average for all countries was 20% in 2024.The swift turnover is the result of govt policies aimed at leveraging Nepal's wealth of hydropower, easing dependence on imported fossil fuels and clearing the smog. It has been fed by an intense push from Nepal's biggest neighbour, China, world's dominant manufacturer of battery-powered vehicles.""For us, using EVs is a comparative advantage,"" said Mahesh Bhattarai, DG of Nepal's department of customs. ""In the global market, Chinese EVs are expanding. The same is happening in Nepal."" The effort stands in contrast to policies in the US and Europe, which have blocked Chinese EVs to protect their domestic auto industries. And it carries hope for other developing countries that seek to become wealthier without enduring the crucible of pollution from which many rich nations have already emerged.""We're interested in making sure this rapid growth in these emerging markets doesn't follow the same trajectory as developed markets,"" said the head of sustainable transportation for UN Environment Programme. But as Nepal has learned, there are obstacles. The country has spent heavily on subsidies, and getting rid of the support too quickly could derail the shift to battery power. Even if gas-powered passenger cars are phased out, cleaning the air will require public transportation to go electric as well.Asian Development Bank has been a key financier of Nepal's dams, transmission lines and charging networks. The head of ADB's resident mission in Nepa is cautious about the risk of backsliding. ""Given the economic sense this EV conversion represents, I think I would see it as unlikely that we would have major policy change.""Businesses and advocates are, however, concerned Nepal may already be backing off its commitment to the transition. It has had three PMs in past five years, and priorities have shifted with each of them. Nepal's central bank doubled down-payment requirements for EVs. Govt has been inching up its tariffs on EVs. And auto dealers worry faulty cars from some smaller Chinese brands could discredit the category. Rajan Babu Shrestha holds the licence to distribute cars in Nepal from Tata Motors. He has seen sales skyrocket on his EVs, but he could go back to selling gas-powered vehicles if tariffs rose or subsidies for charging stations went away. ""Stability is always a question mark.""","Ev market share in nepal is now behind only those of a few countries, including norway, singapore and ethiopia.

This resulted in a budget deficit of SR34.534 billion ($9.2 billion) for the quarter.While oil revenues fell 29 percent year-on-year, dropping to SR151.7 billion ($40.4 billion), the gap was partially offset by strong performances in key non-oil categories:Government spending fell by 9 percent compared to Q2 2024, declining from SR368.932 billion ($98.4 billion) to SR336.129 billion ($89.6 billion), a reflection of tighter fiscal controls.In the first half of 2025, total revenue reached SR565.210 billion ($150.7 billion), against expenditures of SR658.446 billion ($175.5 billion), leading to a cumulative deficit of SR93.236 billion ($24.8 billion).Of this, non-oil revenues totaled SR263.667 billion ($70.3 billion), while oil revenues stood at SR301.543 billion ($80.4 billion).Spending during this period was 2 percent lower than in H1 2024, when it reached SR674.753 billion ($179.8 billion), indicating consistent efforts to rationalize expenditure.At the same time, On the fiscal side:public debt climbed to SR1.39 trillion ($370.7 billion), broken down into:Saudi Arabia’s fiscal and economic transformation under Vision 2030 is producing measurable outcomes, aimed at reducing reliance on oil and building long-term resilience. Key reforms include:These measures are part of the National Transformation Program and Fiscal Balance Program, which focus on non-oil sector growth, seen as more stable and job-rich compared to the oil sector’s volatility.A central driver of this shift is the transformation of the Public Investment Fund (PIF). Once a domestic holding entity, the PIF now operates as a global sovereign wealth fund, directing capital into sectors aligned with future economic trends. Its portfolio spans AI research and development, global startups, big tech, Autonomous/ Self driving technology in partnerships with major electric vehicle manufacturing companies such as Lucid Motors, alongside stakes in firms like Facebook, Starbucks, Disney, Boeing, Citigroup, Live Nation, Marriott, Carnival Cruise Lines, Reliance Retail Ventures, and the Oryx Fund among many others.This global investment strategy complements domestic goals: increasing the non-oil GDP share, diversifying exports, and expanding private sector roles, all critical for future-proofing the economy and generating employment for Saudi Arabia’s growing youth population.","Saudi arabia’s fiscal and economic transformation under vision 2030 is producing measurable outcomes, aimed at reducing reliance on oil.

What Drove July’s Spike?

Understanding How UAE Fuel Prices Are Set





The UAE’s Fuel Price Committee has released the revised retail fuel prices for August 2025, bringing slight relief to motorists after last month’s sharp hike. The new prices, which take effect on Friday, August 1, the new prices, which take effect on Friday, August 1, show a modest dip in petrol categories but a sharp rise in diesel prices compared to July. ”Here’s how fuel prices for August 2025 compare with July:While petrol prices have slightly decreased, diesel saw a notable rise of 15 fils per litre, the only fuel category to go up in August.The price surge in July was one of the highest seen in recent months. Analysts had widely expected this jump, attributing it to rising global crude oil prices during June. This increase followed heightened geopolitical tensions in the Middle East.A sharp escalation between Israel and Iran, including U.S. airstrikes on Iranian nuclear sites, sparked fears of supply disruptions across the region. These developments led to a rally in global crude markets, pushing prices higher and, in turn, impacting fuel rates in the UAE.Fuel pricing in the UAE follows a deregulated model introduced in August 2015, which links local petrol and diesel rates to international oil prices.This policy ensures transparency and aligns retail prices with global market conditions.Each month, the UAE Fuel Price Committee reviews global trends and announces new rates—typically during the final days of the month. These rates take effect from the 1st day of the following month.This approach means UAE motorists feel the impact of both upswings and drops in the international energy market, encouraging more efficient fuel usage while maintaining pricing fairness.","Uae fuel prices are adjusted monthly by the fuel price committee based on global crude oil market fluctuations and international rates.
