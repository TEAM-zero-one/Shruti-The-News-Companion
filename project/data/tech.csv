Astronaut salary breakdown

The paycheck for 287 days in space?

Finally returning to Earth

Nasa astronauts Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmore are set to return home after an unexpectedly long stay aboard the International Space Station (ISS) — but how much are they making for their extended time in space?According to per reports, as GS-15 federal employees, Williams and Wilmore earn an annual salary ranging from $125,133 to $162,672 (approximately Rs 1.08 crore to Rs 1.41 crore). Given their extended 9-month mission, their earnings will be prorated to about $93,850 to $122,004 (around Rs 81 lakh to Rs 1.05 crore).While that might sound impressive, here’s where it gets amusing—Nasa does not pay astronauts overtime. Instead, they receive a small daily stipend for incidentals, which amounts to just $4 per day (Rs 347), according to retired NASA astronaut Cady Coleman.Since Williams and Wilmore have spent 287 days instead of the planned 8, their extra stipend amounts to just $1,148 (Rs 1 lakh). That’s barely enough to cover a fancy dinner after they land—let alone compensate for nearly a year in microgravity!Adding up their base salary plus this modest stipend, their total earnings for the mission will range between $94,998 and $123,152 (approximately Rs 82 lakh to Rs 1.06 crore).After months of delays due to technical issues with the Boeing Starliner, Nasa has now cleared their return. Williams and Wilmore are expected to depart no earlier than March 19 aboard a SpaceX Dragon spacecraft.Meanwhile, the SpaceX Crew-10 mission has arrived at the ISS to take over, bringing Nasa astronauts Anne McClain and Nichole Ayers, Japanese astronaut Takuya Onishi, and Russian cosmonaut Kirill Peskov.","Nasa astronauts sunita williams and butch wilmore are set to return home.

Amid the ongoing debate over Tamil Nadu’s language policy, an old video of Google CEO Sundar Pichai has resurfaced online, adding fuel to the controversy. The video, which has now gone viral, features Pichai mentioning that he learned Hindi in school. A tweet accompanying the clip states: “Sundar Pichai, who comes from Chennai, Tamil Nadu, says—‘I learnt Hindi in school’. Sundar Pichai was born in 1972 and learnt Hindi during Congress rule. Clearly, Hindi was the third language in Tamil Nadu.”The resurfaced video emerges amid backlash against DMK MP Dayanidhi Maran , who claimed that Pichai studied under Tamil Nadu’s two-language policy and credited it for his success.Sundar Pichai was born into a Tamil Brahmin family. His mother, Lakshmi, worked as a stenographer, while his father, Regunatha Pichai, was an electrical engineer at British conglomerate GEC. He pursued metallurgical engineering at IIT Kharagpur, where he excelled academically, earning a silver medal and securing a scholarship to study at Stanford University.Moving to the United States, Pichai completed his MS in engineering and materials science at Stanford. He briefly worked at Applied Materials before pursuing an MBA at the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, which he completed in 2002.Pichai’s career at Google began in 2004, following a short stint at consulting firm McKinsey. He initially worked in product management and development, contributing to projects like Google Toolbar and playing a key role in developing the Chrome browser.His leadership quickly gained recognition, and by 2008, he was named vice president of product development. He was promoted to senior vice president in 2012 and, by 2014, became Google's product chief, overseeing the Android operating system along with other major services. His rise within the company set the stage for his eventual leadership at Google and its parent company, Alphabet.","An old video of google ceo sundar pichai has resurfaced online, adding fuel to the controversy.

Narayana Murthy agrees AI will lead to job losses, but ...

NR Narayana Murthy , co-founder of Infosys , spoke at TiECon Mumbai on Wednesday, attempting to temper the overhyped buzz surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) in India. He pointed out that many systems marketed as AI were simply traditional programming. “I think somehow it has become a fashion in India to talk of AI for everything. I have seen several normal, ordinary programs touted as AI,” Murthy commented during the annual entrepreneurial conference.In a discussion with Harish Mehta, founding president of TiE Mumbai, Murthy clarified that genuine AI rests on two key pillars: Machine learning , which facilitates extensive correlation for predictions, and Deep Learning, which emulates human brain function through unsupervised algorithms.""Frankly, most of what passes for AI these days is trivial and outdated coding,"" Murthy asserted. ""It's the unsupervised algorithms leveraging deep learning and neural networks that hold far greater promise for increasingly human-like capabilities.""Murthy went on to add that deep learning will be able to solve, and handle what are called “unsupervised algorithms”. While machine learning by and large handles supervised algorithms because you have to give a lot of data into that, deep learning uses the data to create new branches of programs or new conditions. And then it will be able to take decisions.While recognizing that AI will displace some jobs, he emphasized its potential to boost economic growth. ""Every technology eliminates certain roles, but when applied supportively, it can expand the economy.""Murthy also urged entrepreneurs to create employment opportunities. “I am confident that each of you will generate hundreds of thousands of jobs—that’s how you address poverty. Handouts have never been effective in lifting any nation out of poverty,” he concluded.","Narayana murthy, co-founder of infosys, spoke at tiecon mumbai on wednesday.

"Inside Lenovo’s Yamato lab, where ThinkPads aren’t just built but are built to last",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/inside-lenovos-yamato-lab-where-thinkpads-arent-just-built-but-are-built-to-last/articleshow/119064898.cms,"Stress test central: How ThinkPads earn their reputation

How Yamato makes ThinkPads just work



Beyond the lab



Behind a nondescript building in Yokohama , Japan , stands the legendary Yamato Lab . This is no typical research facility. It's a place where laptops are not pampered, but systematically pushed to breaking point – and then pushed some more. This is where ThinkPad was born, and now ThinkPads are transformed from mere machines to some of the most durable computing devices known to humankind, engineered to withstand the rigors of daily professional use.Enter the Yamato lab, and you'd think it'd look something like a sterile research lab but it turned out to be a maze of calculated torture chambers for ThinkPads. I watched, slightly wincing, as a ThinkPad was systematically dropped, twisted, and pressed under weights that would make most consumer electronics crumble.Drop tests that simulate a clumsy commuter's worst nightmare? Check. Vibration tests that mimic being jostled in a backpack during a bumpy train ride? Absolutely. Chambers that swing the laptops to their last? You bet.Hinges might seem like the most mundane part of a laptop, and you would just pass it on as an innocuous connection between screen and laptop, but they undergo a relentless opening and closing cycle at Yamato Lab. Automated arms repeatedly open and shut the laptop thousands of times, checking for precise movement, cable integrity, and structural stability.The technician demoing the test for us notes that each hinge is tested to withstand not just gentle touches, but the aggressive slams of stressed executives, the casual drops, and the constant repositioning that comes with a mobile work life.In another room, stress testing takes on an almost surgical precision. Flat circular disks of various sizes – mimicking everything from a carelessly placed heavy book to the accidental pressure of a backpack – apply controlled pressure to the closed laptop lid. These tests aren't just about preventing cracks; they're about ensuring structural integrity under unexpected stresses.Silently doing its work in another corner of the stress testing room, a machine applies systematic pressure to an open laptop display, trying to mimic the action of fingertips pushing the screen to entire palms just forcing the lid down, testing its screen's ability to resist twisting and bending without damaging the pixels.I watched as these machines gradually put all their force on the ThinkPads, testing their ability to withstand compression without compromising internal components.The impact testing is nothing short of brutal. Moved to the other section and a technician was demoing the corner-drop test, where the laptop is deliberately dropped onto a hard surface, landing precisely on its most vulnerable point.Vibration tests are equally intense. A specially designed table randomly shakes a laptop, mimicking the jostle of a commuter's bag, the bumpy ride of a taxi, or the turbulence of a business-class flight.Nearby, a technician casually stands on a ThinkPad X1 Carbon — a sight that would make any computer owner wince, and not just once but multiple times. I did ask them to jump on it, but they didn't, could be the language barrier or could also be it's breaking point.But, where most laptops would crumple like a tin can, this machine remains steadfast, its carbon fiber and magnesium chassis absorbing the weight without so much as a whimper — and that's something to really boast about.That's not even all the brutality that a ThinkPad goes through. Our guide, a meticulous Japanese engineer with decades of experience, tells us these are only a few of about tens of different tests that the folks at Yamato put the ThinkPad through, and each one he says is designed to simulate real-world scenarios that go far beyond the typical wear and tear.Now the Yamato Lab isn't just about creating indestructible machines. It's also about understanding how professionals work, and what's even more important to people who take dozens of calls a day more than they look great and the sound just comes through, and the calls just happen. So, I headed to another floor, which had a room where technicians were testing the three things that you can't just work without — webcam, speaker and the wireless connectivity.In the camera testing area, a wall of diverse skin tones and lighting scenarios created a mini-studio of complexity. Engineers meticulously adjusted white balance, tested color accuracy, and ran AI processing to ensure that every video call renders human features true to life, regardless of lighting conditions or background complexity. There were two ThinkPads, including the newer X1 Carbon, and the difference the investment was clearly visible. One thing though, there were a lot of heads, and they looked horrifically realistic.Next up was the acoustics room, a hemi-anechoic chamber that absorbs sound so completely that the silence feels almost tangible. With high-precision microphones surrounding the test bench, the speakers inside the ThinkPad are subjected to a battery of tests that go far beyond simple measurements.Engineers spend hours sitting in this silent room analyzing every nuance of sound reproduction, mapping out frequency responses, distortion levels, and audio clarity across different volume ranges. Laptop speakers have always been an afterthought, but the room shows how much thought is behind even an afterthought here at Yamato.Wireless connectivity testing looked like something between a radio observatory and a tech bunker, it definitely looked something like straight out of a post-apocalyptic sci-fi movie. Inside, a ThinkPad was strapped onto a precision-engineered rotating platform, rotating in 360-degrees in a radio-wave-absorbing chamber, so that technicians could measure signal strength, stability and performance from every conceivable angle.Again, this was just a peek at how Yamato keeps the essentials in check, so their ThinkPad just works when it needs to. But there is a lot more going behind the scenes. A whole bunch of engineers working on the TrackPoint , yes that red nub in middle of the keyboard, it has its own design process.As we left the Yamato facility, our guide took us to the adjacent ThinkPad museum. Here, decades of innovation were displayed chronologically, from the original models to modern iterations. We admired a gold-plated commemorative ThinkPad that gleamed under the museum lights, alongside an early prototype with an extending display—surprisingly innovative long before today's concept of expandable screens. There were many more.A ThinkPad was so unique to see was the one having a bento box-shaped compartments inside the keyboard. Fun fact: the original ThinkPad design was inspired by Japanese bento boxes, with similar dimensions and internal components arranged in compartmentalized sections, reflecting the thoughtful organization that has defined the brand.Interestingly, many of the original engineers who started with IBM still work here. They've watched the ThinkPad transform from a relatively bulky productivity tool into a sleek, AI-enabled device. Yet through all these evolutions, the core philosophy has remained steadfast: create a laptop that just gets its user through their workday no matter how tough it gets out there.","Yamato lab in yokohama, japan, is the birthplace of the thinkpad.

What is NHS England?

UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer announced on Thursday that NHS England will be abolished, bringing the National Health Service (NHS) back under direct government control.“I’m bringing management of the NHS back into democratic control, by abolishing the arms-length body NHS England,” Starmer said.In a speech, he explained: ""We're going to cut bureaucracy across the state. Focus government on the priorities of working people, shift money to the front line.""He further said, ""Amongst the reasons we're abolishing it is because of the duplication. So if you can believe it, we've got a communications team in NHS England, we've got a communications team in the health department of government. We've got a strategy team in NHS England, a strategy team in the government department. We're duplicating things that could be done once. If we strip that out, which is what we're doing today, that then allows us to free up that money, to put it where it needs to be, which is the front line.""Also read: NHS England announces large-scale cuts as part of government shake-up Starmer arugued that politicians should oversee the NHS rather than an independent body. He concluded by saying this decision will return the NHS to the center of government ""where it belongs"" and added that ""tough choices"" will continue.Under these plans, NHS England will now operate within the UK government's department of health and social care.NHS England is responsible for leading the National Health Service (NHS) in England.It has various functions, including overseeing healthcare services, working with the government to set priorities and funding, and negotiating costs for medical products and services.NHS England is an executive non-departmental public body, which means it is not a government department but operates using public funds under the sponsorship of the department of health and social care.",Uk prime minister keir starmer announced on thursday that nhs england will be abolished.

In some relief for the common man, the cost of a home-cooked vegetarian thali declined year-on-year in February, according to CRISIL’s latest monthly indicator of food plate cost, RRR (Roti Rice Rate). The cost of a non-vegetarian thali, however grew approximately 6% due to rise in broiler (chicken) prices, the report said. On a month-on-month basis the cost of both vegetarian and non-vegetarian thalis came down.The calculation of an average thali's preparation cost at home by CRISIL considers input prices across different regions of India. Monthly variations indicate the impact on everyday household expenses. The analysis tracks price movements of essential ingredients including cereals, pulses, broilers, vegetables, spices, edible oil and cooking gas.The rise in non-vegetarian thali prices was primarily due to a 15% year-on-year increase in broiler (chicken) prices. Broiler (chicken), which constitutes approximately 50% of a non-vegetarian thali's cost, saw this increase due to previous year's low baseline when prices had fallen because of oversupply.Also Read | Q3 FY25 GDP grows at 6.2%; India sees 'highest growth in 12 years' in FY24 - top 10 data points to know Additionally, higher feed expenses, resulting from a 6% year-on-year increase in maize prices, contributed to the overall cost surge.During the month, both vegetarian and nonvegetarian thali costs decreased by 5% compared to the previous month. This reduction was attributed to fresh supplies causing price drops in onion (7%), potato (17%), and tomato (25%). Additionally, broiler (chicken) prices fell by an estimated 5% month-on-month due to reduced demand following bird flu concerns in southern India.","Cost of a home-cooked vegetarian thali declined year-on-year in february.

MUMBAI: FMCG companies are out shopping in the market, weighing potential acquisitions. Three months into the year and the space has seen acquisitions by HUL , ITC , Reliance Consumer Products and Adani Wilmar. A subdued market has made valuations more rational, making it a ripe time to buy.""Corporate CFOs are hungry for M&As as long as valuations are reasonable. The market is soft now and PE (private equity) money is cautious,"" said an analyst tracking the sector. Deal activity is higher in the mid-market space - firms are targeting brands in the Rs 100-500 crore (size in terms of revenue) range, Mayank Rastogi, markets leader, strategy and transactions practice at EY India told TOI.Acquisitions have always been a preferred mode for businesses to expand their market share but over the recent years, the nature of deals have changed - with Indians getting more prone to experimenting in discretionary categories helped by higher disposable incomes, companies are looking to snap up brands operating in high growth spaces like convenience food (includes ready-to-eat/ready-to-cook, frozen food), beauty and personal care (BPC).HUL, for instance, acquired new-age beauty brand Minimalist at a valuation of Rs 2,955 crore while ITC bought Prasuma which built a credible brand in the frozen, chilled and ready to cook foods space to bolster its foothold in the market, pegged at more than Rs 10,000 crore currently. ""A lot of the mainstream FMCG brands have realised that they have not innovated enough. Their R&D pipeline was lacking and inorganic acquisitions is a quick way to grow,"" said Anand Ramanathan, partner and consumer industry leader at Deloitte India. Besides, the growth of e-commerce has enabled new brands to set up shops and localise, stepping up supply of brands in the market and allowing larger FMCG brands to fill in certain white spaces, said Ramanathan.Reliance has been expanding its FMCG footprint largely through acquisitions as it takes on older rivals in a competitive market. Its strategy however, is pivoted around reviving heritage Indian brands-it recently added Velvette and Sil to its portfolio which already includes brands like Campa. The idea to relaunch household brands of yesteryears seems to have worked-Campa, for instance, the company claims, has gained over 10% market share in the sparkling beverages category in certain states. Companies which are eyeing big expansion in tier two and three cities are also targeting regional brands, said analysts.Big companies are expected to continue to consolidate leading brands in BPC, food and beverages. ""These are large sectors and have many regional, traditional, as well as new-age brands who have strong top-of-the-mind brand recall and good scale,"" said Neeraj Shrimali, MD and co-head, digital and technology investment banking at Avendus Capital. For some of the selling brands, being part of larger FMCG companies, allow them to have access to a wider offline distribution reach, he added.","A subdued market has made valuations more rational, making it a ripe time to buy.
