Watch: Shubhanshu Shukla shares timelapse video of 'Bharat from space'; captures 'sunrise in orbit',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/watch-shubhanshu-shukla-shares-timelapse-video-of-bharat-from-space-captures-sunrise-in-orbit/articleshow/123444102.cms,"NEW DELHI: Astronaut Shubhanshu Shukla on Friday shared a breathtaking timelapse video of India from space, offering citizens a glimpse of his journey aboard the International Space Station (ISS).Posting the clip on X, Shukla wrote: “Watch the video in landscape with screen brightness high. While on orbit I tried to capture pictures and videos so that I can share this journey with you all. This is a timelapse video of Bharat from space. The ISS is moving from south to north from the Indian Ocean, along the east coast of India.”He explained that the purple flashes seen in the video were thunderstorms across the country, followed by the Himalayas fading into view, and then a sunrise over the orbit — all against the backdrop of shimmering stars. “It truly is a mesmerising dance of natural elements turning into one beautiful spectacle,” Shukla wrote, adding that despite heavy monsoon clouds he managed to “steal a few shots of Bharat.”""Unfortunately I was up there during the monsoon season and it was mostly cloudy, yet I managed to steal a few shots of Bharat, one of which you are seeing. When you see this I want you to feel as if you are sitting in the cupola((window in ISS) and witnessing it yourself,"" Shukla added.On Thursday, Shukla addressed a press conference in Delhi alongside Union minister Jitendra Singh and ISRO officials, where he described the Axiom-4 mission as a historic achievement and a “mission for the entire nation.” Expressing gratitude to the government, ISRO scientists, researchers and citizens, he said: “I truly felt that this was a mission owned by every Indian.”The astronaut recalled his emotions while viewing Earth from orbit, remarking, “Bharat aaj bhi antariksha se saare jahan se achha dikhta hai.”Sharing mission details, Shukla noted that the crew travelled aboard SpaceX’s Crew Dragon atop a Falcon 9 rocket from Cape Canaveral, spent two weeks at the ISS conducting experiments, and returned via the Pacific Ocean near San Diego.ISRO Chairman V Narayanan hailed the mission as a prestigious milestone, highlighting India’s rapid progress in space technology over the past decade. He pointed to recent successes such as the GSLV-F16 launch of the NASA-ISRO Synthetic Aperture Radar satellite and the growth of India’s private space ecosystem from a single startup to more than 300 today.The Axiom-4 mission, he said, underlined India’s rising global stature in space exploration and collaboration.","Astronaut shubhanshu shukla on friday shared a breathtaking timelapse video of india from space.

NEW DELHI: After a delay of more than six months, the Centre has approved negotiations for building six advanced submarines in India with German collaboration under Project 75 India.According to defence officials quoted by ANI, the defence ministry and state-owned Mazagaon Dockyards Limited (MDL) have been given clearance to begin talks with German firm ThyssenKrupp Marine Systems. Negotiations are expected to start by the end of this month, with the contract likely to be finalised within six months.The decision followed a high-level meeting involving top defence and national security officials who reviewed India’s submarine programme and future fleet requirements. The proposed submarines will feature Air Independent Propulsion (AIP) systems, enabling them to remain submerged for up to three weeks, a significant capability boost for the Indian Navy Officials said the project aims not just to expand the submarine fleet but also to strengthen indigenous capability in designing and manufacturing conventional submarines. The move comes as India faces the twin challenge of modernising its fleet and countering rapid naval expansion by China and Pakistan.The Navy plans to replace about 10 ageing submarines over the next decade. In parallel, India is also pursuing nuclear submarine projects, with private sector major Larsen & Toubro working alongside the Submarine Building Centre to develop two nuclear attack submarines.With Project 75 India, the government is looking to accelerate submarine production and ensure the Navy’s operational readiness in the Indian Ocean region.","Centre gives clearance to defence ministry, mdl to begin negotiations for rs 70,000 crore submarine deal.

NEW DELHI: The department of posts on Saturday announced a temporary suspension of most international postal services to the United States, effective August 25, 2025, in response to major regulatory changes introduced by the US government that impact the international shipping of goods.As per the statement issued by the government, this decision follows the issuance of Executive Order No. 14324 by the US administration on July 30, 2025, which withdraws the duty-free de minimis exemption for goods valued up to USD 800, a threshold that previously allowed low-value goods to enter the US without customs duties.Beginning August 29, 2025, all goods sent to the US, regardless of their value, will be subject to customs duties under the International Emergency Economic Power Act (IEEPA) tariff framework.Gift items valued up to USD 100 will remain exempt from these new duties, according to the executive order.The executive order also outlines new responsibilities for transport carriers and “qualified parties” authorized by US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). These entities are now required to collect and remit duties on international postal shipments.Although CBP released initial guidelines on August 15, 2025, critical implementation details, such as the process for designating “qualified parties” and systems for collecting and remitting duties, have not yet been finalized.Due to these unresolved issues, air carriers handling US-bound international mail have expressed their inability to accept postal consignments after August 25 citing lack of technical and operational preparedness to comply with the new requirements.As a result, the Department of Posts will suspend the booking of all categories of international postal articles destined for the US with effect from August 25 except for the following:These exempted categories will continue to be accepted and transported to the US, subject to further clarifications from CBP and the United States Postal Service (USPS).The department is in close coordination with all relevant stakeholders and is actively monitoring developments. Efforts are being made to resume full postal operations to the US as soon as possible, as per a PIB release.Customers who have already booked items that are no longer eligible for dispatch under the new conditions may apply for a refund of postage.The department expressed regret for the inconvenience caused and reaffirmed its commitment to restoring full service at the earliest opportunity.","The department of posts on saturday announced a temporary suspension of most international postal services to the united states, effective august 25, 2025.

Ethanol-blended petrol push: PIL in Supreme Court challenges nationwide sale of E20; claims 'engines are suffering',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/ethanol-blended-petrol-push-pil-in-supreme-court-challenges-nationwide-sale-of-e20-claims-engines-are-suffering/articleshow/123457552.cms,"India's E20 Push



Is all petrol in India now E20?



How is E20 different from E10 or E15?



What impact does E20 have on vehicles?



What Government said?



NEW DELHI: A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has been filed in the Supreme Court against the nationwide rollout of 20% Ethanol Blended Petrol (E20), claiming that millions of motorists are being forced to use fuel their vehicles are not designed for.The plea, filed by advocate Akshay, has sought directions to the ministry of petroleum & natural gas to ensure ethanol-free petrol (E0) is made available at all fuel stations across the country.The PIL argues that cars and two-wheelers manufactured before 2023 and even some newer BS-VI models, are not compatible with high ethanol blends like E20.""Direct the respondents to ensure that consumers are informed about ethanol compatibility of their vehicles at the time of fuel dispensing. Engines are suffering corrosion, fuel efficiency is dropping, and repair bills are mounting, while insurance companies are rejecting claims for damage caused by ethanol fuel,"" the plea stated.The petitioner further sought clear labelling of ethanol content at all petrol pumps and dispensing units so that consumers are fully informed about what they are purchasing.The petition highlighted that global practices differ sharply.In countries like the US and EU, ethanol-free petrol continues to be widely available, and pumps clearly display the ethanol content.In India, however, only ethanol-blended petrol is sold, and there is no disclosure of composition at dispensing units, the plea added.India has accelerated its transition to E20 fuel, a blend of 20% ethanol and 80% petrol, as part of its efforts to cut carbon emissions and reduce dependence on imported crude oil.The nationwide rollout, originally planned for 2030, has now been advanced to 2025. While the government has set ambitious targets, questions remain over the availability of compatible vehicles, supply logistics, and consumer awareness.Not yet. Many petrol pumps are still offering E10 (10% ethanol), while E20 is being gradually introduced in select regions. The government’s aim is to achieve 100% E20 availability across India by 2025.The number indicates the ethanol percentage in the fuel blend. For example, E10 has 10% ethanol, E15 has 15%, and E20 contains 20%. The higher the ethanol content, the lower the reliance on crude oil imports.According to several reports, many motorists have expressed concerns about the impact of E20 fuel, particularly on fuel efficiency.While ethanol has lower energy density than petrol, the mileage impact is relatively small. For E10 vehicles tuned for E20, the drop is just 1-2% .In other vehicles, the reduction could range between 3-6% and even that can be minimised with proper engine tuning, reported ANI.The ministry of petroleum and natural gas issued a statement rejecting all viral social media posts alleging that E20 causes a major fall in fuel efficiency.Calling the claims ""factually incorrect,"" the ministry said they lack any scientific backing or expert validation.","A public interest litigation (pil) has been filed in the supreme court against the rollout of 20% ethanol blended petrol (e20) the plea, filed by advocate akshay, has sought directions to the ministry of petroleum & natural gas to ensure ethanol-free petrol (e0) is made available at all fuel stations across the country.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123458210,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-58496,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: On the country’s second National Space Day, PM Narendra Modi on Saturday announced that India has already reached the Moon and Mars, and now it is time we “must explore deeper regions of space”. Emphasising that these unexplored areas hold vital secrets for the future of humanity, the PM announced, “Beyond galaxies lies our horizon!”“India is rapidly advancing in breakthrough technologies such as semi-cryogenic engines and electric propulsion, and very soon, with the dedicated efforts of our scientists, India will launch the Gaganyaan mission and, in the coming years, build its own space station,” Modi said in a special message, revealing India’s upcoming big missions. He also invited young citizens to join India’s ‘astronaut pool’ and help give flight to the country’s aspirations.The PM urged the private sector to come forward and build five space Unicorns in the next five years. “At present, we have five big launches every year; can we scale it to 50 rockets every year, that is one per week?” he asked the private sector. He also announced that the first PSLV rocket built by the private sector will soon be launched.Modi expressed happiness that India’s first private communication satellite is also under development and said preparations are underway to launch an earth observation satellite constellation through public-private partnership. “A vast number of opportunities are being created for India’s youth in the space sector,” he said.The PM highlighted that over 350 startups are emerging as engines of innovation and acceleration in space technology. India is, at present, hosting the International Olympiad on Astronomy and Astrophysics, with nearly 300 young participants from over sixty countries.Recalling that two years ago, India became the first country to reach the South Pole of the Moon, creating history, the PM highlighted that India has also become the fourth country in the world to possess docking-undocking capabilities in space. He shared that just three days ago, he met Group Captain Shubhanshu Shukla, who unfurled the national flag at the International Space Station, filling every Indian with pride. He said when Group Captain Shukla showed him the tricolour, the feeling of touching it was beyond words.“Space-tech is increasingly becoming an integral part of governance in India”, Modi said citing examples such as satellite-based assessment in crop insurance schemes, satellite-enabled information and safety for fishermen, disaster management applications, and the use of geospatial data in the PM Gati Shakti National Master Plan. He informed that to further promote the use of space-tech across central and state governments, National Meet 2.0 was organised on Friday. He expressed his desire for such initiatives to continue and expand. He said India’s journey in space will reach new heights in the coming times.","The pm urged the private sector to come forward and build five space unicorns in the next five years. “at present, we have five big launches every year; can we scale it to 50 rockets every year, that is one per week?” he asked.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-123478043,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-44254,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"
Operation Sindoor gave us chance to use space technologies on Pakistan soil: Minister,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-sindoor-gave-us-chance-to-use-space-technologies-on-pakistan-soil-minister/articleshow/123477995.cms,"Space minister Jitendra Singh, along with Isro chairman V Narayanan and four Indian astronauts at Bharat Mandapam on National Space Day.

NEW DELHI: Space minister Jitendra Singh on Saturday revealed during National Space Day that space technology played a significant role during Operation Sindoor While mentioning the operation during which India launched missiles deep into Pakistan after the Pahalgam terror attack, the minister said, “A few months ago, you saw Operation Sindoor. What you saw was the full presentation of Indian space technology from Earth to space. All you saw was the energy of two key departments — the department of space and department of atomic energy. But what is more important is that these capabilities have been achieved in the last 10 years. Technology development and technology transfer happened in the last 10 years.”“Operation Sindoor gave us an opportunity to test these technologies on Pakistan soil. And, the world got to know what has happened in the last 11 years of the Modi government,” he said.Soon after the operation, Isro chairman V Narayanan had said in May, “At least 10 satellites are working 24x7 for the strategic purpose to ensure the safety and security of the citizens of this country. Without satellite and drone tech, we cannot achieve that (operation).”Isro's satellites provide physical and navigation services for the military.Space-based navigation services of NavIC are used to guide weapons and missiles to their specific targets, Insat satellites provide weather condition information and communication services to the armed forces, Gsat services are being used for strategic communication operations and SAR satellites like Risat provide earth surveillance and observation data.While outlining Isro’s future programmes, which started in 2025 with the launch of an advanced NavIC satellite and will be followed later this year by the uncrewed Gaganyaan-1 mission with a humanoid, the minister said the two of the four astronauts will go to space as part of the manned Gaganyaan mission in 2027. “Thereafter, many more astronauts will go to space,” he said.The manned mission will be followed by Chandrayaan-4 in 2028, a mission to Venus, and the establishment of the proposed Bharat Antariksh Station by 2035. Singh said India has set its sights on placing an astronaut on the Moon by 2040, an endeavour that would symbolically mark the country’s journey towards becoming a developed nation by 2047.India plans to launch more than 100 satellites over the next 15 years, and it will be a mix of govt technology missions and private sector-led operational missions, he said while releasing a roadmap for the space sector for the next 15 years.Singh said the roadmap will guide India's space journey to 2040 and beyond, supporting the vision of Viksit Bharat by leveraging space technology for food and water security, disaster resilience, environmental sustainability and inclusive growth.","Space minister jitendra singh on saturday revealed during national space day that space technology played a significant role during operation sindoor.

Is Roblox shutting down?



""While this was not an easy choice, we believe it is in the best interest of our community. We want to thank everyone who has been part of this journey. Your voices have been heard, and your well-being remains our top priority.""

""Effective September Ist, the platform will no longer be available,""

What can lead to Roblox finally being shut down in 2025?



A viral notice that claims Roblox will shut down on September 1, 2025, permanently has ignited a panic among its players. The message in the notice cited Roblox safety concerns and the popular demand for the platform to shut down, as the reasons behind their step. This notice that now seems to be all over X, and gaining a lot of attention, is coming at a time when Roblox is facing legal scrutiny and international bans. So, is this the end of the popular gaming platform, or is it just a part of the recurring hoax?Here is all we know about the circulating news and whether or not it is officially true.An official-looking announcement, stating Roblox is shutting down, has spread rapidly on X. It states that Roblox made a decision to shut down permanently from September 1, 2025, due to user demand and security concerns. The official announcement further stated,While the announcement that seemed to be official, stated,there is still no news of whether or not it is true. Quite crucially, no official confirmation has been received about this from Roblox. Fans are, therefore, speculating, it is just a hoax, like all the other times before. So, until any confirmation is received, one can relax and continue playing their favorite on the platform.This is not the first time that rumors of Roblox shutting down have surfaced all over social media. In the past, news about Roblox being shut down has spread and repeatedly, those were denied. The claims of Roblox shutdown were called rumors, and a hoax.The platform gave reassurances to the players that the game “isn’t going anywhere.”What’s interesting about the current circulating claims is that Roblox has been under a lot of pressure. From demands for the Roblox CEO resignation to changes in their policies and even the drop in the share price of Roblox, fans speculate that this time, the news can be true. Even the lack of denial or immediate confirmation from the end of Roblox is quite unusual. It has left this situation ambiguous, with players awaiting an official statement soon.While Roblox isn’t any stranger to controversies, the recent lawsuits against the platform by the state of Louisiana, accusing it of failing to protect the young crowd from inappropriate content and predators, have taken a major toll. Games like Public Bathroom Simulator Vibe, Escape to Epstein Island and Diddy Party have also been cited as examples of Roblox explicit content that have been accessible to minors.The lawsuit was not an isolated incident. Many countries, including Turkey, China, and Oman, have banned the platform. Now with Qatar's recent Roblox ban, after social media pushing to take action, over the platform's rising child safety concerns, have brought a lot of Roblox legal troubles. Critics argue that the rapid growth of Roblox has outpaced the platform’s ability to enforce needed moderation. While Roblox did bring in safety measures, including Roblox AI monitoring, there are many who believe all these measures are just reactive and not preventative.In short, with the Roblox international bans, lawsuits, and the player-led boycotts, like #BoycottTheHatch,” Roblox has been facing mounting pressure. The recent viral notice circulating about Roblox shutting down—whether fake or real—shows increased frustration amongst the users, critics and concerned citizens. Whether or not it is true, only time would tell.As of now, the gaming platform remains operational, with millions of gamers aiming for it to be the same. However, the company being silent on the latest rumors is quite concerning. In case the legal actions do succeed, some stricter regulations can force major changes or, worse, can make the platform back off by finally shutting it down.","A viral notice that claims roblox will shut down on september 1, 2025, permanently has ignited a panic among its players.

Alleged Discord conversations between Destiny and Rose gain traction

Destiny responds: “She told me she was 19”

Steven Kenneth Bonnell II, better known as Destiny, has become the center of controversy after serious allegations emerged online. The popular streamer and political commentator is being accused of sharing sexually explicit messages with an individual identified as “Rose,” who was allegedly 17 at the time of their interactions.On August 20, 2025, Kick streamershared screenshots from Destiny’s own chatroom that appeared to show him referencing Rose while taunting critics. In the leaked posts, Destiny dismissed concerns that he was “hiding stuff” and even mentioned details about Rose’s college, which many claimed could have led to her being doxed.The casual tone of his remarks only fueled speculation. Critics argued that his comments revealed not only recklessness but also a pattern of minimizing accusations against him.Later that same day, additional screenshots circulated online, this time allegedly from Discord. Shared by user @KweenInYellow, the messages appeared to show explicit exchanges between Destiny and Rose dating back to 2022.The screenshots, if accurate, included sexual references and raised alarm because of Rose’s reported age at the time.These images spread rapidly across X and Reddit, with fans and critics dissecting their authenticity.Some pointed out that dates and usernames seemed consistent with Destiny’s past accounts, while others cautioned against drawing conclusions without verified sources.As the storm escalated, Destiny addressed the allegations in his own chatroom on August 20. He claimed Rose had told him she was 19 at the time of their conversations and insisted there were logs that could back up his version.He also pointed to claims that Rose had produced large amounts of adult content, arguing that this complicated the narrative being pushed against him.The allegations have dominated online discussions in the streaming world, with reactions deeply divided. Some people are in favor of Destiny and are backing the streamers with facts and their own theories, while others are thrashing him all over social media for his questionable actions with minors.As of this writing, there has been no official action from any official body against Destiny. However, social media has been buzzing with their perspectives on the matter.","Steven kenneth bonnell ii, better known as destiny, has become the center of controversy after serious allegations emerged online.

Frank Seravalli says no rush on Connor Bedard’s extension talks



Connor Bedard’s upcoming season could shape Blackhawks’ long-term plans



Why Chicago is in no rush to extend Connor Bedard



The Chicago Blackhawks took care of one key piece this week, signing Frank Nazar to a seven-year extension worth $6.59 million annually. With Nazar locked in, the focus immediately turns to Connor Bedard, who is entering the final year of his entry-level deal. NHL insider Frank Seravalli has now provided clarity on where Bedard’s extension talks stand heading into a pivotal third season.Nazar’s extension, which begins in 2026-27 and runs through 2032-33, has effectively set a benchmark for Connor Bedard’s next deal. Seravalli pointed out that Nazar’s $6.59 million cap hit “puts a number on the table,” but stressed there is no rush from either side to strike an agreement.He believes there’s a strong likelihood Bedard will let his third season play out before committing, making the upcoming year a crucial factor in shaping negotiations.Bedard is entering the final year of his entry-level contract and remains eligible for an extension. But according to Seravalli, neither Bedard’s camp nor the Blackhawks feel urgency to finalize a deal this summer. Instead, both sides are content to wait and let his third season dictate the next move.The former No. 1 overall pick has already proven he can produce at the NHL level, recording 61 points in 68 games as a rookie. His second year saw him play all 82 games, finishing with 67 points, a modest step back in efficiency. Year three, Seravalli stressed, will be pivotal in determining whether Bedard earns top-tier franchise money or something closer to Nazar’s range.For the Blackhawks, patience appears to be the best strategy. Nazar’s contract provides cost certainty, while Bedard’s value is still being defined. If he delivers a breakout season, Chicago may need to pay closer to the $10 million mark. If not, Nazar’s extension could serve as leverage to keep the number lower.Also Read: Charlie McAvoy’s wife Kiley shares heartwarming pictures of baby Rhys channeling dad with mini helmet No. 73 What’s clear from Seravalli’s update is that neither side is rushing. The Blackhawks are weighing their future around the cap, and Bedard is betting on himself to raise the bar. How he performs in year three will go a long way in shaping not just his own contract, but Chicago’s rebuild.",Chicago blackhawks signed frank nazar to a seven-year extension worth $6.59 million annually.

A short look at Evander Kane’s Vancouver journey



Evander Kane, a Vancouver Canucks forward, has in recent times gained attention for reasons unrelated to hockey. This 33-year-old athlete showed his fiancée, Mara Teigen, on her birthday that she was cherished, via an Instagram tribute. A person with so much intensity on the ice showed a softer side by honouring not just his partner but the family that they have built together. His posts spoke of love, appreciation, togetherness and offered a peek into his personal life away from the rink.For Mara Teigen's big day, Evander Kane decorated Instagram with two story posts. The first one showed a radiant photo of Mara along with the heartwarming message: ""Happy birthday Mara Teigen. We all love you very much,"" followed by several affectionate emojis. His second post showed the couple enjoying wine in a cozy café, gazing warmly into each other's eyes—a picture of sheer contentment.Mara also gave an account of the preparations, beginning with an all-night party accompanied by children. Balloons spelling “Mom” filled the room, complemented by a coffee mug reading “best mom ever.” Hendrix stood tall, holding a big heart-shaped balloon, as Mara narrated about her little ones being her “best friends.”With the day coming to a close, she posted glowing photos of herself with the kids, with the house having been warmed by love.The posts mirrored the couple's synergy, with Mara focusing on motherhood while Kane channelled his love for her; together they wove a story that is far from a mere birthday tribute, instead indicative of family togetherness and shared joy.Kane's celebration coincides with the deal that made him a member of the Vancouver Canucks. The move is special given that he grew up in the city, getting in-game time before the families and friends. He is itching to spend time on the ice rink contributing, but more importantly, he wants to spend some quality time with his family.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky's legacy faces a new debate after Frank Nazar’s mega deal Evander Kane's heartfelt birthday tribute to Mara Teigen went much farther than mere wishes and conveying love, esteem, and family unity.

Karnataka Bike Taxi Services: Karnataka’s transport minister orders aggregators to stop bike-taxi services in Bengaluru; but captains and riders happily vroom away,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/bengaluru/karnatakas-transport-minister-asks-aggregators-to-stop-bike-taxi-services-in-bengaluru/articleshow/123460902.cms,"Waive platform fee: Riders

BENGALURU: The road ahead for bike-taxi services appears to be smooth, at least for now. Crippled by lack of last-mile connectivity and uncertain auto or cab rides, customers are happily hopping on to bikes and reaching their destination without hassle.While Karnataka high court has clarified that it hasn't passed any order allowing the resumption of bike-taxi services and that the state govt is free to act against ride-hailing aggregators in keeping with existing legal provisions, the court also said individual bike owners offering taxi services or the ride captains must not be harassed by the authorities. On Friday, taxi aggregators continued to provide bike taxis on their respective platforms.Transport minister Ramalinga Reddy told TOI that aggregators must comply with the court's directive. ""Aggregators must disable bike-taxi services on their apps. We'll monitor the situation closely. If there are violations, then we'll take appropriate action,"" he said.On Thursday morning, three major ride-hailing apps — Uber, Rapido, and Ola — resumed bike-taxi services after a gap of two months. Waseem Akram K, 25, said it's a huge relief that bike taxis are back in the city.""When the service was stopped, people like me who depended on bikes during emergencies or peak traffic hours really struggled. Bikes are cheaper and far more convenient than autos or cabs. For instance, if I travel alone, paying over Rs 100 for an auto makes no sense, while a bike ride on the same route costs just Rs 49,"" he said, adding he commutes from Mahadevapura to Marathahalli every day.Even thousands of riders are relieved. They had switched to other gigs after the blanket ban on bike-taxi services came into force two months ago. Ashok K, a rider, said, ""For two months, I struggled a lot. I joined two delivery services, but earnings were poor. It took an hour to pick up a parcel and deliver it to the customer. I used to get Rs 40 to Rs 50 per delivery, which is not worth the money spent. Whereas with bike taxis, the returns are higher. I earn up to Rs 1,000 a day.""Another bike-taxi rider claimed they received a message from aggregators on Thursday that the ""high court has allowed"" bike-taxi services. ""I accepted 5-6 bookings on Thursday, and a lot more rides on Friday,"" he added.The Bike Taxi Association has requested taxi aggregators to allow riders to use their application free of cost. A press release from association president Adi Narayan said, ""We request platforms to access technology free of cost so that we can start earning a livelihood once again. For lakhs of us, your platform is our only way to connect with customers.""",Karnataka high court has clarified that it hasn't passed any order allowing the resumption of bike-taxi services.

A billionaire breaking the mold

Judy Faulkner, the 82-year-old CEO of Epic Systems, has built a remarkable $7.8 billion fortune through her 43% stake in the company, yet she has never taken a single share for personal use. Instead, she has committed to giving away nearly all her wealth to philanthropic causes, signing Bill Gates’ Giving Pledge in 2015 to donate 99% of her fortune. Beyond finances, Faulkner has created a corporate culture that values creativity, curiosity, and learning. From whimsical themed office buildings to innovative company-wide gatherings, she proves that leadership and generosity can coexist, while setting an example for other business leaders that success can be measured not only in profits but also in positive impact on employees and society.Faulkner, together with her husband, launched Roots & Wings to provide grants to nonprofits dedicated to improving the health, education, and well-being of children and families. Since its inception, the foundation has grown into a major philanthropic vehicle: in 2020, it granted $15 million to 115 organizations, and by 2024, it projected $67 million in grants to 305 nonprofits nationwide. Faulkner intends to steadily expand giving, aiming to distribute $100 million annually by 2027. To responsibly manage the sale of her non-voting Epic shares without destabilizing the company, she established a trust that governs these transactions. This careful planning ensures that her philanthropic mission can continue without affecting Epic’s stability or long-term growth.Epic Systems’ 1,670-acre campus in Wisconsin is far from a conventional office environment. Its 28 buildings feature fantastical themes ranging from Harry Potter and Alice in Wonderland to The Wizard of Oz, organized into mini-campuses such as Prairie Campus, Wizards Academy, and Storybook Campus. Inside, employees help source artwork and whimsical installations, including chocolate chip trails leading to a mock chocolate factory, hanging bridges to treehouses, and magical sculptures scattered across the grounds. This imaginative setting reflects Faulkner’s philosophy that creativity, play, and aesthetic engagement foster learning and productivity, making the workplace not just a location for tasks but a space for inspiration and collaboration.Once a month, Epic employees gather in the underground auditorium called Deep Space for a mandatory meeting affectionately nicknamed “work church.” These gatherings cover essential business news, company updates, and operational targets. Yet Faulkner adds unique elements that transform standard corporate meetings into engaging learning experiences. For instance, she incorporates grammar lessons, teaching employees proper usage of words such as “who” and “whom,” and emphasizing communication skills alongside company strategy. By blending education with corporate updates, these meetings reinforce a culture of continuous learning, intellectual curiosity, and attention to detail, encouraging employees to grow professionally and personally within the company. Her story demonstrates that visionary leadership can redefine both corporate culture and philanthropy on a global scale.Epic Systems is part of a broader trend of companies reimagining office culture to enhance employee engagement. Wellstar Health System, for example, offers wellness rooms with massage chairs, calming music, and healthy snacks, resulting in a 10% drop in employee turnover in 2024. Nonprofit Understood designs offices specifically for neurodivergent employees, with adjustable lighting, temperature zones, and assistive listening systems to support diverse needs. Even CEOs like Jeff Bezos favor “messy meetings” over rehearsed discussions to stimulate open debate and creativity. These examples show that unconventional setups, when thoughtfully implemented, can increase productivity, employee satisfaction, and innovation across industries.While many billionaires sign high-profile pledges without fully following through, Faulkner stands apart as a rare example of commitment and action. By giving away nearly all her wealth through philanthropy, cultivating a creative and educational workplace, and fostering employee engagement through unconventional office design and corporate rituals, she sets a benchmark for responsible, visionary leadership. Her approach demonstrates that a CEO can combine financial success, ethical responsibility, and innovation to create a lasting impact—not just on a company’s bottom line, but on the lives of employees, communities, and society at large. Faulkner’s legacy shows that generosity and innovation are not mutually exclusive but can reinforce each other. Her model inspires future leaders to pursue business success with purpose, creativity, and a commitment to societal well-being.","Ceo judy faulkner gives away nearly all her wealth through roots & wings.

Nvidia H20 Chips for China: What’s Really Going On?

TikTok website is live in India. After a five-year absence, the Chinese short video app TikTok has sparked excitement among its former Indian user base. The platform's website has become accessible for some users in India, leading to widespread speculation of a potential comeback. However, the app remains unavailable on Google Play Store and App Store, and there is no statement from the company regarding a return.Notably, the move is not without its caveats. While some users have reported being able to access the website, others on X say it remains blocked. When the members of the Times of India tech team checked, they were able to access the homepage but not any other page.When clicked on “Newsroom” a message flashes saying, “You don't have access to this page Our services aren't available in your country or region.” Additionally, a click on “Careers” returns “503 Service Temporarily Unavailable” message. The 'Contacts' link on the page too is opening. It is taking to a page that shows 'Partners', 'Media Enquiries', 'Legal Enquiries' and 'Privacy'.The development has reignited conversations around the 2020 ban. The government initially blocked TikTok along with 58 other Chinese apps, including Shareit and CamScanner, citing national security concerns. The Ministry of Electronics and IT stated that the apps were “prejudicial to sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of state and public order.”Meanwhile, TikTok is also facing a ban in the US. However, President Donald Trump has said that he has American buyers ready to acquire TikTok, and he is open to extending the deadline for its Chinese parent company, ByteDance, to sell the app’s US assets.The company is also laying off several employees in the UK and said that this move is part of a “reorganisation” to centralise its operations and increase its reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) for moderation.","Chinese short video app tiktok's website is now live in india.
