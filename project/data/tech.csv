Lab bench to battlefield: Bengaluru innovation helps save lives,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/lab-bench-to-battlefield-bengaluru-innovation-helps-save-lives/articleshow/121084294.cms,"BENGALURU: An innovative haemostatic dressing developed by scientists at IISc and manufactured by a Bengaluru-based startup from its Doddaballapur unit is proving to be an asset for Indian defence forces , providing rapid bleeding control in emergency battlefield situations along the border.The innovative product ( FIBROPLUG ), a patented technology developed through industry-academic collaboration — IISc and Fibroheal Woundcare Pvt Ltd — is a silk-chitosan composite haemostat.The product’s unique bio-composite formulation facilitates rapid clotting while establishing a protective barrier over wound sites, making it an essential tool for military healthcare professionals operating in challenging conditions.Fibroheal co-founder Vivek Mishra told TOI that in just the past week, the startup has supplied 5,000 units of FIBROPLUG to 16 field hospitals spread across the western and northern sectors.The dressing features a two-layered structure, with a base of chitosan (derived from shellfish) that quickly attracts blood cells and initiates clotting, topped with a layer made of silk fibroin infused with silica particles.“This combination overcomes limitations of existing haemostatic products. While traditional chitosan-based bandages are often sticky and can cause rebleeding when removed, FIBROPLUG’s silk layer forms a smooth barrier against the skin, preventing adhesion and allowing for easy removal without disturbing the healing wound,” Prof Kaushik Chatterjee from IISc, who lab developed the technology which has been transferred to Fibroheal, told TOI.Laboratory tests on rats demonstrated the dressing's effectiveness, stopping bleeding in just over 30 seconds while leaving no residue or causing rebleeding. Human applications have shown similarly impressive results, with bleeding control achieved in under two minutes—significantly faster than conventional dressings.The product is available in four different delivery systems and various sizes, enabling effective haemorrhage control across a range of traumatic wounds, including difficult and deep injuries.Fibroheal, founded in 2017 by Mishra and Bharat Tandon, was established with the vision of addressing critical gaps in the Indian wound care and medtech segment by harnessing the biomaterial applications of silk proteins. The company approached researchers at IISc led by Prof Chatterjee in 2018, initiating a partnership that would eventually yield results.“Our first engagement with the armed forces happened before. That was for a special forces unit, details of which we cannot share. I think once our product got qualified with them, the other orders started coming in,"" Mishra said. “We started receiving orders from the last week of April.”While FIBROPLUG has proven very useful in military settings, its potential extends well beyond the battlefield. The same technology that saves lives on the front lines can be equally effective in civilian emergency scenarios, from car accidents and kitchen mishaps to playground injuries.The dressing's ease of use makes it suitable for inclusion in ambulances, hospitals, schools and homes, potentially democratising access to advanced wound care across India.While Fibroheal continues to expand production at its Doddaballapur facility, Vijay Singh, IP manager at IISc’s IPTeL (Intellectual Property and Technology Licensing) said: “...The project goes on to show not only Indian scientific ingenuity but also a model for successful industry-institute collaboration that translates academic research into life-saving products with global potential.”","Fibroheal woundcare pvt ltd has supplied 5,000 units of fibroplug to 16 field hospitals.

What is Mending Enchantment: How to Get Mending in Minecraft?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/esports/minecraft/what-is-mending-enchantment-how-to-get-mending-in-minecraft/articleshow/121088223.cms,"image via Mojang

How to Get Mending in Minecraft

How To Get MENDING In Minecraft 2025! (EASY Tutorial!)

Trading with Librarian Villagers: Locate or create a village and assign a lectern to a villager to turn them into a librarian.

Continuously replace the lectern to refresh the librarian's trade offers until Mending appears.

In versions with the Villager Trade Rebalance experiment enabled, only swamp biome librarians at the master level offer Mending books. Fishing: Use a fishing rod to fish in any body of water.

There is a small chance to catch an enchanted book with Mending, though this method is time-consuming and relies heavily on luck. Looting Chests in Generated Structures: Explore structures such as jungle temples, strongholds, and ancient cities.

These locations have chests that may contain enchanted books, including Mending. Raid Drops (Bedrock Edition only): Participate in village raids, where defeating certain enemies may yield enchanted books as drops.

Mending is a type of enchantment in Minecraft that allows players to repair their tools, weapons, and armor using experience points. When a player adds or gets a mending enchanted tool and equips it while collecting XP, then the item automatically regains health/durability, making it last longer and reducing the need for manual repairs. Mending enchantment is usually made on rare and high-tier items in Minecraft since they are very valuable.It is considered a treasure enchantment since it cannot be obtained from a regular enchanting table. Instead, players have to acquire it through various methods like trading, fishing, etc.To find and acquire the mending enchantment in Minecraft requires a strategic approach, as it is not available through easy modes and conventional ways of enchanting.Here are the following primary methods through which players can obtain mending in Minecraft:Once the player obtains a Mending book, it can be applied to the desired item through using an anvil. Combining mending books with tools, weapons, and armor pieces will add mending. It can only be used once, and it is incompatible with the Infinity enchantment. Which means both of them cannot be applied to the same item.In Minecraft there are many enchantments available, and mending is one of them. Its unique ability to repair items through collecting XP makes it very famous and a must-have enchantment in Minecraft. Finding mending requires effort through trading, fishing, or exploring specific structures, but the reward is very beneficial, which justifies the hard work behind acquiring it.","Mending is a type of enchantment in minecraft that allows players to repair their tools, weapons, and armor using experience points.

Apple plans to add AI Search in Safari browser; Senior VP Eddy Cue points to 3 Google rivals,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/apple-plans-to-add-ai-search-in-safari-browser-senior-vp-eddy-cue-points-to-3-google-rivals/articleshow/120993178.cms,"Apple in discussions with OpenAI, Perplexity and others

Apple is planning to add AI-powered search options in the Safari browser . According to a Bloomberg report, Apple’s senior vice president of services, Eddy Cue said during his testimony with the US Justice Department that the company is “actively looking at” reshaping Safari. During the testimony, he revealed that searches on Safari dipped for the first time last month.“That has never happened in 22 years,” he said, adding this is due to people using AI. Cue said he believes that AI tools like OpenAI , Perplexity AI and Anthropic’s Claude AI, will eventually replace search engines like Google Chrome, further adding that Apple will bring these options to Safari in the future.“We will add them to the list — they probably won’t be the default,” he said.Currently, Google is the default search engine on Apple’s Safari browser for which the company pays around $20 billion a year to keep. Analysts estimate this accounts for about 36% of the search advertising revenue Google earns through Safari.Cue said that Apple is in discussions with AI search providers like OpenAI, Perplexity and Anthropic to add their AI tools as an option to Safari.“Prior to AI, my feeling around this was, none of the others were valid choices,” he said. “I think today there is much greater potential because there are new entrants attacking the problem in a different way.”Apple currently integrates OpenAI’s ChatGPT into its Siri digital assistant and plans to add Google’s AI tool Gemini later this year. Cue said the company also considered other AI options, including Anthropic, Perplexity, China-based DeepSeek, and Grok from Elon Musk’s xAI.He added that the deal with OpenAI gives Apple the flexibility to bring in other AI providers to its operating system, including Apple’s own AI models.Google-parent company Alphabet’s shares dipped about 8% on Wednesday (May 7), wiping out $160 billion from the company’s market capitalisation following Eddy Cue’s testimony.","Apple in discussions with openai, perplexity and others to add their ai tools as an option to safari.

Jensen Huang's warning to US leaders: ‘Get American AI out in front’ or risk losing China AI market,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/jensen-huangs-warning-to-us-leaders-get-american-ai-out-in-front-or-risk-losing-china-ai-market/articleshow/120992439.cms,"Jensen Huang's warning to US leaders

""tremendous loss,""

Nvidia targets $50 billion in China's AI boom – why it can't afford to miss out

Impact of US export restrictions on Nvidia

Broader economic implications for the US

China’s rapid AI advancements and competitive threats

Financial performance and market outlook

The path forward: Balancing growth and national security

“The world is right now hungry, anxious to engage AI,”

“Let us get the American AI out in front of everybody right now.”

Nvidia , the world’s leading producer of graphics processing units (GPUs) and a dominant force in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry, is facing a critical challenge as US-China trade tensions continue to escalate. CEO Jensen Huang recently emphasized the significance of the Chinese AI market , which he estimates could reach $50 billion in the next two to three years.Speaking at ServiceNow’s Knowledge 2025 conference in Las Vegas, Huang described the potential loss of access to this market as ahighlighting the broader economic impact on US jobs, revenue, and technological leadership. This concern comes amid tighter US export restrictions that have significantly affected Nvidia’s business prospects in China, one of its largest international markets.China has long been a vital market for Nvidia, not only as a major consumer of its advanced AI chips but also as a hub for cutting-edge AI research and development. Nvidia’s GPUs, known for their unmatched parallel processing capabilities, are essential for training and deploying sophisticated AI models, making them indispensable for industries ranging from autonomous vehicles to cloud computing.Huang noted in his interview that China’s AI market could grow to $50 billion within the next two to three years, presenting a massive revenue opportunity. Given that Nvidia’s GPUs have become the backbone of the global AI industry, securing a share of this rapidly expanding market is critical for the company’s long-term growth.However, Nvidia’s ability to access this lucrative market has been increasingly constrained by US export controls aimed at limiting China’s technological advancements. Last month, the Trump administration further tightened these restrictions, requiring special licenses for Nvidia to ship its H20 chips to China. These chips, part of the Hopper architecture, were specifically designed to comply with earlier export regulations but are now caught in the latest wave of trade restrictions.As a result, Nvidia announced a staggering $5.5 billion quarterly charge, reflecting the financial blow of losing a critical revenue stream. This move marks one of the most significant financial impacts on the company since it became a trillion-dollar tech giant, raising concerns about the sustainability of its rapid growth.Huang highlighted the broader economic consequences of these export restrictions, emphasizing the potential loss of US jobs and tax revenue. During the interview, he argued that maintaining access to the Chinese market is not just about Nvidia’s bottom line but also about the long-term competitiveness of the US tech sector.“We just have to stay agile,” Huang said, stressing the importance of balancing national security concerns with the need for economic growth and technological leadership. He added that the ongoing restrictions could force Chinese companies to develop domestic alternatives, potentially reducing US influence in the global AI industry over the long term.Huang’s comments come amid growing concerns about China’s rapid progress in AI technology. At a separate tech conference in Washington, D.C., in April, Huang warned that China is “not behind” in AI and described Huawei as “one of the most formidable technology companies in the world.”This assessment aligns with recent reports indicating that Chinese firms like Huawei and DeepSeek have made significant strides in developing their own AI chips, potentially challenging Nvidia’s dominance in this critical sector. Huang’s remarks underscore the competitive pressure Nvidia faces as it navigates a complex geopolitical landscape.Despite these challenges, Nvidia remains a dominant force in the global AI market. The company’s market capitalization has approached $3 trillion, making it one of the most valuable tech companies in the world. However, its stock has experienced significant volatility in recent months, with shares down about 15% so far this year after nearly tripling in 2023.Nvidia is set to report its next quarterly earnings on May 28, with analysts expecting a 65% year-over-year revenue increase to $43.1 billion, according to data from LSEG. This projected growth reflects the ongoing demand for AI hardware, even as the company grapples with geopolitical uncertainties and supply chain challenges.Huang’s recent comments highlight the delicate balance Nvidia must strike as it seeks to maintain its leadership in the AI industry while navigating complex geopolitical challenges. As US policymakers weigh the risks and benefits of restricting high-tech exports to China, companies like Nvidia face tough decisions about how to adapt to an increasingly fragmented global market.Huang said during his Las Vegas appearance.With AI becoming a critical driver of economic growth and technological innovation, the stakes for Nvidia and the broader US tech sector have never been higher.","Jensen huang recently emphasized the significance of the chinese ai market, which he estimates could reach $50 billion in the next two to three years.

Addressing privacy concerns and ethical challenges

The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and digital technologies has brought both unprecedented opportunities and significant challenges, particularly in verifying online identities. In response to this, Sam Altman , the visionary co-founder of OpenAI, has introduced his latest ambitious endeavor, the World Project , in the United States. Previously known as Worldcoin, this initiative aims to revolutionize digital identity verification using biometric data, specifically through eye-scanning technology .The project, co-developed by Tools for Humanity, seeks to create a global, secure, and decentralized identity system that can differentiate humans from AI bots in an increasingly digital world. As the World Project officially launched in six US cities on May 1, 2025, it marked a significant step toward transforming online authentication and digital trust.The World Project is driven by a bold vision: to establish a universally accessible digital identity system that safeguards individual privacy while ensuring secure interactions online. The core technology behind this initiative is the Orb, a sleek, silver sphere designed to scan and encode a user’s unique iris pattern into an encrypted IrisCode. Unlike traditional username and password systems, which are vulnerable to hacking and phishing, the World ID offers a more secure alternative by using biometric data that cannot be easily replicated.Tools for Humanity, the company behind the World Project, was co-founded by Sam Altman and CEO Alex Blania. Their mission is to build a decentralized identity platform that can serve as a foundational layer for the digital economy, reducing fraud and restoring trust in online interactions. The World ID system promises to be a critical tool in combating the rise of deepfakes, AI-generated content, and bot-driven misinformation.The Orb is a key component of the World Project’s identity verification system. It captures a user’s iris pattern, transforming it into a unique IrisCode that is encrypted and stored on a blockchain. This approach offers significant security advantages:In the US, the initial rollout includes 7,500 Orbs deployed across six major cities: Atlanta, Austin, Los Angeles, Miami, Nashville, and San Francisco. The company plans to quadruple its global hardware footprint by the end of 2025, further expanding the availability of World IDs.To encourage early adoption, the World Project offers users 14 WLD cryptocurrency tokens in exchange for participating in the iris-scanning process. These tokens, part of the broader World ecosystem, can be used for online transactions, decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, and digital identity verification.In addition to the Orb, the World Project is set to launch the World Card, a crypto-linked debit card developed in partnership with Visa. This card will allow users to spend their WLD tokens at any location that accepts Visa, bridging the gap between the digital and physical economies. This integration marks a significant step toward making digital currencies more practical and widely accepted.The US launch of the World Project comes with several high-profile partnerships aimed at integrating World ID into mainstream applications. Notably, Match Group, the parent company of Tinder, Hinge, and other dating platforms, is piloting World ID for identity verification on Tinder in Japan. This move is intended to reduce catfishing and online fraud by ensuring that users are verified humans. If successful, this technology could extend to other dating platforms, enhancing user trust and safety.Despite its ambitious goals, the World Project faces significant challenges, particularly around privacy and data security. Critics have raised concerns about the ethical implications of incentivizing biometric data collection with cryptocurrency rewards. Reports of coercion by Orb operators in some regions and the emergence of a black market for iris data have further complicated the project’s public perception.To address these concerns, the World Project has emphasized its commitment to transparency and data protection. The company claims that it does not store actual iris images and that its blockchain-based approach ensures that no single entity can control or misuse the data. Nevertheless, building public trust will be a critical factor in the project’s long-term success.","Openai's sam altman launched the world project in the us on may 1, 2025.

X has received executive orders from the Indian government requiring X to block over 8,000 accounts in India, subject to potential penalties including significant fines and imprisonment of the company’s local employees. The orders include demands to block access in India to accounts belonging to international news organizations and prominent X users.

Poll Do you think blocking accounts is an effective way to enforce local laws? No, it stifles communication Yes, it can deter illegal activity

In most cases, the Indian government has not specified which posts from an account have violated India's local laws. For a significant number of accounts, we did not receive any evidence or justification to block the accounts.

To comply with the orders, we will withhold the specified accounts in India alone. We have begun that process. However, we disagree with the Indian government’s demands. Blocking entire accounts is not only unnecessary, it amounts to censorship of existing and future content, and is contrary to the fundamental right of free speech.

This is not an easy decision, however keeping the platform accessible in India is vital to Indians’ ability to access information.

We believe that making these executive orders public is essential for transparency – lack of disclosure discourages accountability and can contribute to arbitrary decision making. However, due to legal restrictions, we are unable to publish the executive orders at this time.

X is exploring all possible legal avenues available to the company. Unlike users located in India, X is restricted by Indian law in its ability to bring legal challenges against these executive orders. However, we encourage all users who are impacted by these blocking orders to seek appropriate relief from the courts.

Users may contact any of the below legal aid organizations:

National Legal Services Authority (http://nalsa.gov.in)

Karnataka Legal Services Authority (http://kslsa.kar.nic.in)

We have provided the affected users with notice of the actions in accordance with our policies. Affected users may also contact the Indian government at cyberlaw@meity.gov.in.

Elon Musk-owned social media platform Twitter (now known as X) said it has received orders from the Indian government to block more than 8,000 accounts that include those of some “international news organizations” and “prominent X users” for violating local laws. Sharing the post, the official handle of X's Global Government Affairs said that it has complied with orders and has started the process of withholding the specified accounts in the country.The post also stated that the company has provided the affected users with notice of the actions in accordance with its policies.“However, we disagree with the Indian government’s demands.

""From the corporate loan sanctions, you can see there is a lot of activity. The growth can be 15-16%. Lower interest rates will also help the offtake of corporate and retail loans ,"" he said, adding that the bank has lined up a strong retail push, apart from agriculture and MSMEs.While it looks to double its exposure to self-help groups to over Rs 20,000 crore this year, PNB is also focusing on retail loans, tapping into govt's focus and expects its Rs 8,500-crore education loan portfolio to expand significantly. Besides, it will tap into the growing demand for home loans, promising to sanction loans within 48-72 hours for projects that have received RERA approval. Lower rates are expected to be especially useful, given that PNB has lowered rates to 7.95%.A healthy growth in the retail loan segment is expected to help the bank reduce the weight of low-yielding corporate loans. In the last quarter, it shed Rs 30,000-35,000 crore of such loans from its corporate portfolio, and the plan is to reduce it by another Rs 10,000-15,000 crore.Chandra said the bank is generating a healthy flow of term deposits to meet its credit flow requirements, and the recently launched deposit schemes that come with special offers such as cancer or health cover will help it mop up current and savings account balances. Since April 13, nearly 1.8 lakh accounts were opened, raising Rs 300 crore, and the target is to open 10 lakh such accounts in three months to rake in Rs 2,000-3,000 crore in a year.","Punjab national bank will focus on renewable energy, defence, roads, engineering, and transmission.

Chinese EV battery giant CATL aims to raise $4 bn in Hong Kong IPO,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/china/chinese-ev-battery-giant-catl-aims-to-raise-4-bn-in-hong-kong-ipo/articleshow/121092657.cms,"Chinese EV battery giant CATL aims to raise $4 bn in Hong Kong IPO

'Military-linked company'





HONG KONG: Chinese EV battery giant CATL aims to raise $4 billion in its Hong Kong listing scheduled for May 20, said a statement filed to the bourse Monday, making it the largest IPO expected in the city so far this year.A global leader in the sector, CATL produces more than a third of all electric vehicle (EV) batteries sold worldwide, working with major brands including Tesla, Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen.The company is already listed in Shenzhen, and its plan for a secondary listing in Hong Kong was announced in a December filing with the stock exchange.According to a prospectus filed Monday, CATL will offer approximately 117.9 million units priced at up to HK$263 per share ($33.8) for total expected proceeds of HK$31.01 billion.The listing is set to take place next Tuesday (May 20).Cornerstone investors, including Sinopec and Kuwait Investment Authority, agreed to buy shares worth HK$2.62 billion, the prospectus shows.Founded in 2011 in the eastern Chinese city of Ningde, Contemporary Amperex Technology Co., Limited (CATL) was initially propelled to success by rapid growth in the domestic market.But the world's largest EV market has more recently begun to show signs of flagging sales amid a broader slowdown in consumption.The trends have fuelled a fierce price war in China's expansive EV sector, putting smaller firms under huge pressure to compete while remaining financially viable.But CATL continues to post solid performances, with its net profit jumping 32.9 percent in the first quarter.Funds raised from a secondary listing could be used to accelerate CATL's overseas expansion, particularly in Europe.The battery giant is building its second factory on the continent in Hungary after launching its first in Germany in January 2023.In December, CATL announced that it would work with automotive giant Stellantis on a $4.3 billion factory to make EV batteries in Spain, with production slated to begin by the end of 2026.Earlier analysts said CATL's float could be a blockbuster initial public offering that could boost Hong Kong's fortunes as a listing hub.Hong Kong's stock exchange is eager for the return of big-name Chinese listings in hopes of regaining its crown as the world's top IPO venue.The Chinese finance hub saw a steady decline in new offerings since Beijing's regulatory crackdown starting in 2020 led some Chinese mega-companies to put their plans on hold.In a list issued in January by the US Defense Department, CATL was designated as a ""Chinese military company"".The United States House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party highlighted this inclusion in letters to two American banks in April, urging them to withdraw from the IPO deal with the ""Chinese military-linked company"".But the two American banks JPMorgan and Bank of America are still on the deal.Beijing has denounced the list as ""suppression"", while CATL denied engaging ""in any military related activities"".According to Bloomberg, CATL plans to make the deal as a ""Reg S"" offering, which doesn't allow sales to US onshore investors, limiting the company's exposure to legal risks in the United States.",Chinese ev battery giant catl aims to raise $4 bn in hong kong ipo.

Indian Oil Corporation Ltd’s 4QFY25 EBITDA was a 110% beat on est., driven by higher-than-estimated GRM (USD8/bbl) as well as marketing margins (INR5.9/lit). With tax rate coming in below est. , resultant PAT stood 5x above est. at INR72.6b. While the OMC rally may be nearing its end, near-term catalysts remain. 1Q earnings may benefit from lower LPG under-recoveries after recent ₹50/cylinder price hike, softer propane prices, higher Russian crude intake aiding GRMs, and steady marketing earnings.It is well-positioned with major refinery expansions (~17.7mmtpa) scheduled for 4QFY6–1HFY27 & plans to add 3,000–4,000 new retail outlets in FY26 to its 40,000+ network. The recent drop in crude prices below $60/bbl—the lowest since Feb’21—also provides a favourable backdrop for margins.M&M reported a better-than-expected performance in Q4, led by a strong margin beat in the FES segment (at 19.4% vs 17.3% est.).Revenue grew 24.5% YoY, and EBITDA margin expanded 180bp YoY to 14.9%, driven by improved ASPs across both the Auto and FES segments. Management remains confident of outperforming the UV industry in FY26, driven by new launches like Thar Roxx, XUV 3XO, and recent EVs. It plans to boost UV capacity to 69k/85K units in FY26/FY27, with a greenfield project for future requirements beyond FY28. We believe MM is well-placed to outperform across its core business, driven by healthy recovery in rural areas and new product launches across both UV and tractor segments. We estimate MM to post CAGR of 13%/13%/18% in revenue/EBITDA/PAT over FY25–27E.","Motilal oswal financial services ltd, the top stock picks for the week (starting may 12, 2025) are indian oil corporation ltd and m&m.

"In a 1st for quarter, banks net Rs 1 lakh crore profit",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/in-a-1st-for-quarter-banks-net-1l-cr-profit/articleshow/121093237.cms,"Representative image

MUMBAI: The banking sector's Q4 consolidated net profit has crossed Rs 1 lakh crore for the first time. Public sector and private banks together posted a net profit of Rs 1,00,178 crore in Q4FY25, up 9% from Rs 91,829 crore in the year-ago quarter.Bank earnings accounted for over a third of listed companies' profits, which stood at around Rs 2.93 lakh crore. This growth came despite a squeeze in net interest margins, as lending rates fell following RBI's Feb rate cut, while deposit costs stayed high. Lenders, however, offset the impact through treasury gains and recoveries from bad loans.The rate cut and RBI's liquidity infusion brought down bond yields, resulting in mark-to-market gains.As bond yields fall, the value of older bonds with higher coupons rises. Banks booked profits by selling part of their government bond holdings, either to other banks or to RBI, which conducted open market repurchases.Public sector banks benefited more from the decline in bond yields as nearly a fourth of their deposits are invested in government securities. Their Q4FY25 net profit rose 13% to Rs 49,301 crore from Rs 43,615 crore, including IDBI Bank, which, while classified as a private lender, is largely owned by LIC and the govt.Private sector banks posted a relatively modest 5.2% rise in net profit to Rs 50,877 crore from Rs 48,214 crore. These figures exclude IndusInd Bank, which is expected to take a significant earnings hit due to provisions of nearly Rs 2,000 crore on derivative losses. Analysts warn that profits could turn negative if further provisioning is needed for its microfinance book.Among PSU banks, four lenders-SBI (40%), Bank of Baroda (10.8%), Canara Bank (10.3%), Union Bank (10.1%) and PNB (9.4%)-contributed over 80% of the profits. SBI was the only PSU bank to report a decline, with net profit falling 8% to Rs 19,941 crore.In the private sector, profits were even more concentrated. HDFC Bank accounted for 37.9%, ICICI Bank 28.1%, and Axis Bank 14.7% of the total.Analysts say that the banking sector's earning growth directly corresponds to the growth in gross domestic product. While banks do face margin pressure when interest rates dip, it is usually compensated for through increased demand, an improvement in trading profits and lower provisions.","Public sector and private banks together posted a net profit of rs 1,00,178 crore in q4fy25.

The recent announcement of India UK FTA is new in the series of bilateral FTAs negotiated in the recent past – starting with Australia, followed by UAE and EFTA countries (Norway, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Iceland). It demonstrates a very deliberate and sure-footed approach of expanding India’s FTA footprint for gaining market access for goods of Indian origin and opening new avenues of growth and international cooperation. It’s the joint success story of India’s Trade & Foreign Policy Successful negotiation of the FTA with the UK – till most recently being part of the EU, also bodes well for the progress that India will be able to make with EU FTA negotiations which have been waiting for a decisive push after the past thirteen years of negotiations.India EU FTA has been held back on issues like unconditional market access to European luxury car manufacturers at concessional rate of duty, better access to alco-beverage sector and need for data secure status for India.As is evident from the PIB press release issued on May 6, some of the long standing, contentious issues, which have been holding back the India EU negotiations have been successfully addressed in the India UK FTA.Illustratively progressive reduction in duty rates on import of completely built-up cars from the UK over a period of ten years, subject to the upper limit on the number of cars that can be imported in a year.This quota-based access to luxury or fully built up cars under the FTA is a unique solution which balances out the opposite policy pull of granting market access but without adversely impacting the domestic industry. Simultaneous reduction in duty on cars and implementing annual limits to complete built-up cars is a balanced solution.We have seen this position playing out even in case of reduction in basic customs duty rate on import of superbikes about 1600 cc of engine capacity, or in case of EV policy allowing access to a certain number of complete built up EVs subject to an investment commitment.Also, reduction in duty rates on import of whiskey was another long-standing issue which seems to be resolved not only under India UK FTA but also when India unilaterally announced reduction in the duty rate on Bourbon whiskey of US origin.All these developments are a good omen for a positive outcome in India EU FTA. EU is India’s second largest trading partner and FTA with EU would be a powerful foreign policy win for the government.The initial sound bites on the impact of India UK FTA are very encouraging but fine prints of the agreement are yet to be analyzed. Open questions are how many cars are to be allowed to be imported annually; how will the origin of such cars be established; how would the licensing and control be put in place; whether DGFT will be the nodal agency for granting and monitoring of annual quota; whether the quota will be issued on the name of company. There are many such questions which would require an answer.This newfound flexibility and decisiveness demonstrated by the government in finding win-win solutions to long pending issues is a welcome development which would open the doors of fresh economic activity which could continue to drive growth in GDP and better relationships with partner countries. And the timing of the India UK FTA can’t be better when India is also expecting to close the bilateral trade discussions with the US government. Signing of a series of new FTAs underline the success of India’s foreign policy and trade policy working together.",India uk fta is new in the series of bilateral ftas negotiated in the recent past.
