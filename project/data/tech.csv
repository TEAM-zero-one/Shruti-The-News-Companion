What Sam Altman really said: AI with ""novel insights"" by 2026

""By 2026, we will likely see the arrival of systems that can figure out novel insights,""

What does ""novel insight"" really mean

An AI race for survival: Other technology giants are not lagging behind

Google DeepMind just released a paper on AlphaEvolve, a coding AI agent that created innovative solutions to challenging math problems, something even accomplished researchers hadn't tried.

Anthropic founder of Claude AI, established a research grant program in May 2025 to support research projects that employ AI to generate scientific hypotheses and conduct experiments.

FutureHouse, founded by ex-Google CEO Eric Schmidt, states its AI assisted in an actual scientific breakthrough, though details are kept under wraps.

Lila Sciences, a startup by now-former OpenAI researcher Kenneth Stanley, has raised $200 million to create a lab dedicated to teaching AI models to ask more intelligent scientific questions, a basic prerequisite for insight.

Why 'novel insights' from AI might still be useless, experts say

In a fresh thought-provoking article entitled ""The Gentle Singularity,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has again moved in with a daring prediction: by 2026, artificial intelligence systems will be able to make ""novel insights."" The claim may sound ambiguous in itself, yet in the context of the developing objectives of OpenAI and the wider competitive scene of AI research, it weighs. Altman, who is famous for his futurist vision and bold declarations regarding artificial general intelligence (AGI), presents this forecast as part of an extended evolution of human society, one where AI remakes work, energy, innovation, and even scientific breakthroughs.His essay, released June 10, 2025, is more than prediction; it can be used as an unofficial guide for where OpenAI and its competitors are going next. This race towards AI systems coming up with genuine, new ideas instead of merely recombining present information is becoming the next arms race in technology innovation. With major breakthroughs being achieved by Google DeepMind, Anthropic, and upstart companies such as Lila Sciences and FutureHouse, the stakes are high not just for corporate hegemony but for the future of science itself.Altman's essay describes his vision for the ""gentle singularity,"" an era in which AGI does not destroy or dismantle civilization but rather becomes a productive, evolutionary partner to humans. Perhaps one of the most remarkable things he predicts is this:This matter-of-fact-sounding sentence has huge implications. First of all, it indicates that OpenAI is approaching a level of model capability where artificial intelligence can move past summarization, prediction, or pattern matching and start to think creatively. This is the distinction between an AI that simply reports data and one that adds meaningfully to human knowledge.OpenAI President and co-founder Greg Brockman has recently supported this concept when announcing the o3 and o4-mini models in April 2025. ""These were the first models scientists used to create useful new ideas in their field,"" he declared, suggesting that OpenAI is already developing the kind of AI that Altman described in his essay.The ""novel insight"" in AI is the capability of the AI model to generate new, valuable, and hitherto not thought-provoking ideas or hypotheses. This characteristic stretches much beyond the current realm of capabilities of AI chatbots and big language models that are based on spewing out known facts.Altman's prophetic essay is not isolated. Over the past few months, a host of major players have taken strategic actions in line with the premise of ""novel insight"" creation:Even as the hype sets in, top AI minds remain hesitant. Hugging Face Chief Science Officer Thomas Wolf recently contended that existing models can't pose genuinely new questions, a precondition for any scientific breakthrough. Likewise, Kenneth Stanley himself concedes that the issue is ""fundamentally difficult,"" not merely a matter of computational horsepower but modeling what humans find ""interesting"" or ""meaningful."" Others argue that while AI can recombine existing ideas in surprising ways, it lacks the context to understand why a question matters. This limitation keeps it tethered to patterns, not purpose, reducing its role to augmentation rather than true innovation.Creativity is not just computation, but intuition and judgment areas where AI still lags. This means that even if models can generate new hypotheses, it remains unclear how useful, testable, or correct these insights will be. In science, novelty alone isn't enough; it must be actionable and verifiable. Until AI bridges that gap, its 'insights' may remain intellectually impressive but practically inert.","Openai ceo sam altman predicts that by 2026, artificial intelligence systems will be able to make ""novel insights"" race towards ai systems coming up with genuine, new ideas is becoming the next arms race in technology innovation.

Taiwan Blacklists Chinese technology company that is designated as 'National Security Threat' by the US,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/taiwan-blacklists-chinese-technology-company-that-us-has-designated-as-national-security-threat/articleshow/121853311.cms,"When America designated Huawei as 'National Security Threat'

Taiwan has blacklisted China's Huawei Technologies Co. and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp. According to a report in Bloomberg, Taiwan’s International Trade Administration has included Huawei, SMIC and several of their subsidiaries in an update of its so-called strategic high-tech commodities entity list, according to the latest version that was made available on its website on Saturday, June 14. This is said to deal a serious blow to the two companies spearheading China’s efforts to develop cutting-edge AI chip technologies. The change, which was not publicly announced, requires Taiwanese companies to obtain government approval before exporting to listed entities.Both the companies are also banned by the United States of America (USA). In June 2020 the America's Federal Communications Commission (FCC) designated two Chinese companies -- Huawei Technologies Company (Huawei) and ZTE Corporation (ZTE), as well as their parents, affiliates, and subsidiaries -- as covered companies for purposes of the agency’s November 2019 ban on the use of universal service support to purchase equipment or services from companies posing a national security threat. America has also placed SMIC and some of its subsidiaries on the US entity list, which has significantly limited the companies' ability to acquire foreign technology.Citing Taiwan’s regulations, the report noted that the new restrictions could significantly limit Huawei and SMIC’s access to Taiwan’s plant construction technologies, materials, and equipment critical for producing AI semiconductors, such as those manufactured by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSMC) for companies like Nvidia. The updated list also includes Huawei’s units in Japan, Russia, and Germany.In 2023, Bloomberg News reported that several Taiwanese firms were assisting Huawei in developing a covert network of chip plants in southern China. This latest move by Taipei may disrupt those efforts, further constraining the Chinese companies’ semiconductor ambitions.The report highlighted that Taiwan had previously imposed blanket bans on exporting chipmaking equipment, such as lithography machines, to China but had not targeted specific Chinese tech firms on its entity list until now. TSMC, a key supplier for Apple and Nvidia, halted supplies to Huawei in 2020 due to U.S. export controls.Huawei and SMIC made headlines in 2023 by unveiling a 7-nanometer chip made in China, surprising U.S. policymakers. Despite global restrictions, the companies remain China’s best hope for bridging the AI chip gap left by limited access to Nvidia’s advanced semiconductors.The restrictions come amid escalating tensions, with Taiwan President Lai Ching-te earlier this year labeling China a “foreign hostile force” and introducing measures to counter infiltration, Bloomberg reported. China, which claims Taiwan as its territory and has threatened unification by force, has not yet responded to the new measures.","Taiwan has blacklisted china's huawei technologies co. and semiconductor manufacturing international corp.

Steve Jobs was brilliant but don’t copy this 'one habit' of him; warns Pixar's Pete Docter,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/steve-jobs-was-brilliant-but-dont-copy-this-one-habit-of-him-warns-pixars-pete-docter/articleshow/121851338.cms,"Steve Jobs was brilliant but don’t copy this 'one habit' of him; warns Pixar's Pete Docter

Why Steve Jobs told Pixar, “This Is Not My Business” - and meant it



Decoding genius: Steve Jobs' ability to distill complexity

Steve Jobs called at 3 AM - Pete Docter says that’s ‘one habit’ you shouldn’t copy



Behind the scenes: Pixar's quiet rise to the top

Leadership lessons for today's visionaries

When Steve Jobs bought Pixar from George Lucas in 1986 for $10 million, few could have imagined the impact this would have - both on animation, but ultimately on the future of creative entrepreneurship. Pixar was then a struggling graphics division with limited numbers and grand aspirations. Jobs’ decision was widely considered risky, especially since the company had yet to prove itself as a viable business in the entertainment space. But what unfolded over the next two decades transformed not only the fate of Pixar, but also Jobs’ legacy beyond Apple Fast forward to 2025, and Pixar is one of the world's most legendary animation houses, with a catalog of Oscar winners and a reputation for storytelling greatness. A lot of that, Chief Creative Officer Pete Docter says, had to do with Jobs' none-too-hands-on approach to creative choices but rather with his skill at stepping back. Speaking at the Fast Company Most Innovative Companies Summit, Docter drew from Jobs' distinctive style of leadership, offering never-before-heard perspectives that highlight how restraint, emotional intelligence, and prioritisation guided Pixar's path.Though he was the executive producer and economic lifeline of Pixar, Steve Jobs never attempted to influence the storytelling direction of the studio. Pete Docter, the company's third animator who is now the brains behind movies such as Up and Inside Out, noted that Jobs kept out of his way. ""Steve was really good at saying, 'This is not my business,'"" Docter recalled.This amount of creative trust is not to be found, particularly from a person who's been stereotyped as a micromanager in his early days at Apple. Yet Jobs at Pixar seemed to know that good storytelling took room. He funded the humans, the technology, and the buildings but he never attempted to ""direct the director."" Rather, he listened. He provided counsel when required. He entered not as a general, but as a partner.This methodology enabled Pixar's artists to experiment freely. It created the foundation for the studio's unprecedented success, beginning with Toy Story in 1995, the first computer-animated full-length feature film, and followed up with Finding Nemo, Ratatouille, Up, Inside Out, and Soul.Jobs wasn't only hands-off, he was laser-sharp when it counted. Jobs, Docter said, had a talent for entering into a complicated conversation and, in a matter of minutes, being able to identify the root of the issue. ""He could sit for about five minutes and review what the conversation was actually about,"" Docter said. ""That's not something anyone's born with. It was the result of years of practice.This ability, cutting through noise to locate the signal is what made Jobs such a good strategist, even beyond his comfort zone. Whether it was a meeting regarding server capacity, distribution logistics, or creative tone, Jobs was able to immediately grasp the crux of the problem and challenge his team to crack it.This ability wasn’t just intellectual, it was emotional. Jobs was able to read the currents in a room, detect underlying tensions, and gently move individuals toward understanding. In a time when numerous leaders are concerned with establishing dominance, Jobs' strength resided in his ability to see what truly counted and to pose the proper questions rather than provide all the solutions.But even visionaries are not perfect and Docter wasn't afraid to call them out. One of Jobs' most infamous tendencies was his lack of respect for boundaries. “He would call — especially the producers — at any time, day or night, 3 in the morning, you’re on vacation, doesn’t matter,” Docter revealed. “He wants to talk to you about it, you’re on.”This intensity, while sometimes idealized, also produced burnout and stress. Jobs' all-consuming urgency was galvanizing but draining. Docter conceded that he's tried not to inherit that specific habit, although he occasionally sends late-night emails himself too. “That’s what my wife is trying to get me to stop doing,” he joked.This story is a cautionary tale: even the greatest leaders need to discover where to set limits. Passion is great but boundaries allow for long-term success.While Pixar's meteoric ascendancy is invariably linked with technical ingenuity and storytelling brilliance, its organizational culture also played a pivotal role. Jobs permitted the studio to forge its own identity even when Disney acquired Pixar for $7.4 billion in 2006, rendering him the largest Disney shareholder at the time.Former Disney Chief Executive Bob Iger once said he expected Jobs to be tough. But instead, he found him to be open-minded and reflective. “Who wouldn’t want Steve Jobs to have influence over how a company is run?” Iger told Vanity Fair in an interview.Jobs' commitment to explaining things until they made sense, not mandating decisions by hierarchy, served to maintain Pixar's creative DNA even within the gigantic edifice of Disney. He did not care to win arguments. He craved alignment and that made him an unusual executive in Silicon Valley and Hollywood.In the modern world of high-pressure startups, midnight Slack messages, and always-on culture, Docter’s reflections offer a timely reminder: the most effective leaders are those who listen more than they talk. Jobs' legacy at Pixar wasn’t about control, it was about clarity.His genius wasn’t just in innovation, but in emotional strategy. He could read rooms, empower people, and know when to step back. Yet, his occasional lack of boundaries reminds current leaders that brilliance without empathy can cost relationships and morale.Pete Docter takes Pixar's helm with a more measured hand these days, blending Jobs' wisdom with his own sense of how creative individuals work best. As Pixar keeps pushing the boundaries of great storytelling, its core continues to be based on the culture Jobs helped foster - not by dictating it, but by believing in it.","Steve jobs was brilliant but don’t copy this 'one habit' of him; warns pixar's pete docter. Jobs was able to read the currents in a room, detect underlying tensions, and gently move individuals toward understanding.

In a significant overhaul of Indian railways' ticketing policy, the Ministry of Railways made it clear that from July 1, 2025, only Aadhaar-verified users will be entitled to reserve tickets under the Tatkal system through the IRCTC portal or mobile application. It is a key step towards stricter digital identity authentication to prevent misuse, bring in more transparency, and ensure the facility of emergency ticketing reaches legitimate passengers.In a sequel to this order, the ministry has also directed an extra OTP-based Aadhaar authentication layer from July 15, 2025, in order to further rationalise the process. The Indian Railways' move, as conveyed to all zonal railway divisions on June 10, 2025, is in light of increasing festival season demand and growing complaints of manipulation of bookings by agents. Here is the entire explanation of the new regulations, implementation schedule, agent restrictions, and booking practical tips all passengers must be aware of.From July 1, Tatkal tickets could only be booked by passengers who have done Aadhaar authentication on IRCTC's website and mobile app.From July 15, 2025, even authenticated users will have to undergo a one-time password (OTP) authentication process associated with their Aadhaar number during every Tatkal booking.With a view to minimizing bulk bookings and ensuring level playing ground for the public:These restrictions will be applied on all zones and directions have been issued to both CRIS (Centre for Railway Information Systems) and IRCTC to enforce these steps by modifying back-end systems and user interfaces.The Railway Ministry has made it clear that the aim is to:The new policy essentially transforms the manner in which emergency train tickets will be secured in India. While Aadhaar verification maximizes transparency and equity, it might also present challenges for those who have not linked their ID with IRCTC or those who are not technologically savvy.

What Anthropic CEO said on AI

Anthropic on Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang's statement

Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang expressed sharp disagreement with Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei ’s predictions about AI-driven job automation during a press briefing at VivaTech in Paris. Huang specifically challenged Amodei’s recent claim that AI could eliminate up to 50% of entry-level white-collar jobs within five years, dismissing the notion as overly alarmist.“I pretty much disagree with almost everything [Amodei] says,” Huang stated, critiquing three key points he attributed to Amodei: that AI is so dangerous only a select few should develop it, that it’s too costly for widespread development, and that its power will lead to massive job losses. “If you want things to be done safely and responsibly, you do it in the open … Don’t do it in a dark room and tell me it’s safe,” Huang added, advocating for transparent and collaborative AI development.Amodei, in a recent Axios interview, had warned that AI could disrupt half of entry-level office roles and urged policymakers to prepare for economic impacts. Huang countered that while AI will transform jobs, it will also create new opportunities, citing increased productivity as a driver for hiring. “Some jobs will be obsolete, but many jobs are going to be created,” he said.In response, an Anthropic spokesperson clarified to Fortune that Amodei has never claimed only Anthropic should build AI. “Dario has advocated for a national transparency standard for AI developers … so the public and policymakers are aware of the models’ capabilities and risks,” the statement read. The spokesperson reaffirmed Amodei’s concerns about AI’s economic impact and his commitment to addressing them.Anthropic, founded in 2021 by Amodei and other ex-OpenAI researchers, prioritizes safety in AI development, a focus rooted in the founders’ reported concerns over OpenAI’s direction.

You are the reason I look at my phone and smile

In your arms is where I find my peace

My favorite place in the world is next to you

You make my heart skip a beat

I didn’t choose you my heart did

Forever is not long enough with you

Every love story is beautiful but ours is my favorite

With you every moment is magical

You are the poem I never knew how to write

You had me at hello

I still fall for you every single day

Your smile is literally the cutest thing I’ve ever seen

I just want to make you happy because you make me happy

You are my today and all of my tomorrows

Loving you is the best decision I ever made

The best feeling is when you look at me and smile

I saw that you were perfect and so I loved you

Then I saw that you were not perfect and I loved you even more

Your love is all I need to feel complete

You’re the reason behind my smile

You + Me = Forever

I never want to stop making memories with you

Emotional WhatsApp captions



I wish I could turn back time and make everything right

The saddest thing is feeling alone in a crowd

I’m drowning in memories and there’s no way out

Every heart has a pain only the way of expressing it is different

The hardest part is pretending to be happy

Some days I just want to disappear

It’s hard to find happiness when you feel like nothing

The silence after an argument is the loudest sound

It hurts when you realize you aren’t as important to someone as you thought

Saying goodbye to the one you love is like saying goodbye to your own happiness

Sometimes you have to pretend everything is fine when it’s not

I’m not okay but I’ll pretend to be

Behind every strong person is a story that left them broken

Loving you was my favorite mistake

It’s hard to forget someone who was your entire life

I miss the old us

You left without a goodbye and now I’m left with the pieces

I wish I could stop loving you but my heart refuses to listen

Sometimes the people who are thousands of miles away from you can make you feel better than the ones right beside you

I thought I mattered but I was wrong

I’m tired of fighting for a love that’s already gone

The scars you can’t see are the hardest to heal

Tears speak when the heart can't

Smiling outside, breaking inside

Sometimes silence is the loudest cry

I’m tired of pretending I’m fine

Lost in a world that doesn’t see me

It hurts, but I’ll deal with it

The worst pain is being forgotten

I miss the old me

We were perfect… until we weren’t

Crying isn’t a weakness, it’s a release

The hardest part is acting like it’s okay

Some scars never show, but they’re the deepest

Loved too much, lost too hard

Trust once broken is hard to rebuild

Happiness left and didn’t say goodbye

I’m okay… just tired of everything

When memories hurt more than they heal

Faking smiles is an exhausting job

Some wounds time doesn't heal

I'm not mad, just disappointed

Hope hurts more than letting go

People change, promises break

Missing you is a daily struggle

I wish feelings had an off switch

Loneliness feels louder at night

We said forever, but forever ended early

No more expectations, no more pain

Too broken to be fixed

Love left, emptiness stayed

Heart full of words never said

Life WhatsApp captions



Life isn’t perfect but it has perfect moments

Just because you’re breathing doesn’t mean you’re living

Life goes on with or without you

Collect moments not things

Life is a one time offer use it well

Don’t count the days make the days count

Simplicity is the keynote of true life

Life is short smile while you still have teeth

Your vibe attracts your tribe

Difficult roads often lead to beautiful destinations

Life begins at the end of your comfort zone

Stay close to people who feel like sunshine

In the end we only regret the chances we didn’t take

Be yourself life’s too short to be anyone else

Life’s beauty lies in small moments

Life is tough but so are you

Fall in love with taking care of yourself

Live the story you want to tell

Don’t survive thrive

Life doesn’t have to be perfect to be beautiful

Let your life be your message

Live less out of habit more out of intent

You only live once but if you do it right once is enough

Life is a journey enjoy the ride

Don’t just exist live

Life is made of moments not milestones

Be the energy you want to attract

Make peace with your past so it doesn’t spoil your present

The best view comes after the hardest climb

Life rewards the brave

Life is what happens when you're busy making other plans

Live life to the fullest

To live is the rarest thing in the world Most people exist that is all

Life is short and its up to you to make it sweet

In the end its not the years in your life that count Its the life in your years

The purpose of life is to believe to hope and to strive

Life is about making an impact not making an income

Life is straightforward but we insist on complicating it

Life is a journey that must be traveled no matter how bad the roads and accommodations

Life is like riding a bicycle To keep your balance you must keep moving

Life is 10 percent what happens to us and 90 percent how we react to it

Life isn't about finding yourself. It's about creating yourself

Life is too important to be taken seriously

Life is short smile while you still have teeth

Life is a onetime offer use it well

Life is a beautiful struggle

Life is short and it is up to you to make it sweet

Life is a daring adventure or nothing at all

Life is made of ever so many partings welded together

Life is trying things to see if they work

Intel to begin laying off factory workers in July; here's what the company said,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/tech-news/intel-to-begin-laying-off-factory-workers-in-july-heres-what-the-company-said/articleshow/121854413.cms,"Representative Image

What Intel said about laying off factory workers

Samsung Galaxy Book 5 Pro Review: Built for Real Work

Intel is set to begin laying off factory workers at its Silicon Forest campus in Oregon starting mid-July. The initial round of layoffs is expected to be completed by the end of the month. However, the chip-making company has indicated that further reductions may be implemented if deemed necessary. According to a report by Oregon Live, Intel informed its employees of this decision this week. An internal message sent to staff at Intel's production facilities outlined a restructuring within the Intel Foundry manufacturing group. This reorganisation aims to shift the group's focus more towards engineering and technical roles, implying a reduction in middle management positions.While specific figures for the number of affected employees have not been provided yet, the company's message suggests that the decision is official. Intel noted that these measures are a necessary step to enhance its financial position.In a statement sent to Tom’s Hardware, Intel wrote: “As we announced earlier this year, we are taking steps to become a leaner, faster and more efficient company. Removing organisational complexity and empowering our engineers will enable us to better serve the needs of our customers and strengthen our execution. We are making these decisions based on careful consideration of what is needed to position our business for the future, and we will treat people with care and respect as we complete this important work.”In December 2024, Intel’s employee headcount stood at 108,900, about 15,000 fewer than under CEO Pat Gelsinger’s cuts last year, the report notes. The company’s Oregon sites were no exception, which cut roughly 3,000 jobs but retained about 20,000 employees.Intel has not specified how many roles will be trimmed at Intel Foundry. However, staff in other divisions told Oregon Live that they anticipate similar cuts, with each unit free to implement layoffs independently as long as they meet their cost-reduction goals.Intel’s Oregon site hosts the company’s D1X and D1D fabs, which, despite heavy automation, depend on engineers, technicians, operators, analysts, and support staff. Critical roles like process engineers and high-skill technicians for EUV lithography are vital and may not be eliminated, the report adds.","Intel is set to begin laying off factory workers at its silicon forest campus in oregon starting mid-july.

Mark Cuban faces users backlash, asked to ...

Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban has publicly criticized Bluesky , the decentralized social media platform he once championed, for becoming “ruder and more hateful,” according to a report by the New York Post. Cuban, known for his tech ventures and former ownership of the NBA’s Dallas Mavericks, warned that the platform’s lack of diverse perspectives is driving users back to Elon Musk ’s X, formerly Twitter.Cuban, who joined Bluesky in late 2024 with an optimistic post -— “Hello Less Hateful World” -- now says the platform has devolved into a hostile echo chamber. “The lack of diversity of thought here is really hurting usage,” he wrote in a series of posts this week, as quoted by the Post. He noted that the platform’s predominantly left-leaning user base often meets dissenting or nuanced opinions with outrage, stifling meaningful discussion. “Engagement went from great convos on many topics, to agree with me or you are a nazi fascist,” Cuban added.The Post reports that Cuban, who supported Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election but did not donate to her campaign, shared a Washington Post opinion piece by Megan McArdle, which argued that Bluesky’s left-leaning user base fosters a political silo. Cuban endorsed the piece, urging users to use the platform’s moderation tools to block rather than attack those they disagree with. “The moderation and block tools on here are so advanced, if you see someone you don’t want to see on here, just block them. Don’t attack them,” he wrote.However, Cuban’s critiques sparked backlash from some Bluesky users , the Post noted. Responses included profane attacks, with one user writing, “Go wipe your crocodile tears with a wad of hundreds you tw-t,” and another stating, “F–kin leave then, p—y.” A third user, whose post Cuban reposted, called him a “despicable bastard” and told him to “just Go Away.”The report highlighted Bluesky’s rapid growth, noting that its user base tripled from 10 million to over 30 million between November 2024 and May 2025, according to Pew Research Center. This surge followed Elon Musk’s endorsement of Donald Trump’s reelection campaign, which prompted many liberal-leaning users to leave X for Bluesky. Yet, Cuban’s recent comments suggest the platform’s ideological slant may now be pushing users back to Twitter.Cuban, whose net worth is approximately $8.35 billion per the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, lamented that even minor disagreements on Bluesky often escalate into hostility. “Even if you agree with 95% of what a person is saying on a topic, if there is one point that you might call out as being more of a grey area, they will call you a fascist etc.,” he wrote, per the Post.",Mark cuban slams bluesky for becoming hostile echo chamber.

Poll Do you think AI coding assistants can fully replace human developers in startups? No, human expertise is essential Yes, they can replace developers

GitHub CEO Thomas Dohmke warned startup founders at VivaTech in Paris that while AI coding assistants can help launch companies, scaling them requires human developers and technical expertise . Speaking at Station F startup campus , Dohmke said bootstrapped startups built predominantly with AI coding tools ""doesn't have much value"" to investors and would struggle to justify funding rounds without complex systems built by skilled developers.The Microsoft-owned platform's CEO explained that non-technical founders increasingly use "" vibe coding ,"" natural language prompts that generate code, to build products with small teams and minimal funding. However, this approach creates a crowded market where investors question why they should choose one AI-built startup over another. ""The investors would ask, 'Why would I invest in you instead of the 10 other people?'"" Dohmke said, emphasizing that startups need deeper understanding of their systems to attract serious investment.Dohmke observed a dramatic shift in AI adoption over the past two years, from companies needing convincing to widespread ""FOMO"" in the market. While AI tools have democratized startup creation, he stressed that successful scaling requires developers who can build sophisticated systems. ""A non-technical founder will find it difficult to build a startup at scale without developers because they can't build a complex system to justify the next round,"" he explained.The GitHub CEO, whose platform serves over 150 million users worldwide, acknowledged the excitement around AI-driven engineering but maintained that coding skills remain essential. He previously stated that ""every kid, every child, should learn coding"" because knowing when to rely on personal coding abilities versus AI assistance is crucial.

Gold price prediction today: MCX Gold August 2025 contract has opened with a spectacular gap up at ₹100,300, marking a massive surge of over 1,800 points from previous levels. This dramatic move is likely triggered by overnight geopolitical tensions on Israel attacks on Iran Nuclear sites. Dollar weakness at 98$, has created a new bullish paradigm for the precious metal. While the gap up presents immediate profit opportunities, seasoned traders are positioning for strategic buy-on-dips entries.The ₹99,000 level, coinciding with the 21-day EMA, represents the most logical support zone for dip buying in this new bullish environment. This level offers multiple confluence factors:1. EMA 21 Support: The 21-period moving average at ₹99,000 provides dynamic support2. Psychological Level: Round number support with strong psychological significance3. Gap Fill Protection: Sufficient distance from gap opening to avoid immediate fill4. Volume Profile: High volume acceptance above ₹99,000 during previous sessions5.
