Belarusian World No.1 Aryna Sabalenka defeated Ukraine’s Elina Svitolina 6-2, 6-3 in the Australian Open semi-final on Thursday to set up a title clash with Elena Rybakina.There was no handshake after the match, in line with protocol involving Ukrainian players and opponents from Russia or Belarus. Before the match at Rod Laver Arena, an announcement informed fans there would be no handshake and asked them to respect the decision. Sabalenka and Svitolina also stayed apart during the pre-match formalities and photographs.Sabalenka moved into a record fourth straight Australian Open final and is chasing her third title in Melbourne. She has not dropped a set at the ongoing Australian Open and will be a firm favourite in the final.Sabalenka and fifth seed Rybakina have now played each other 14 times, with Sabalenka winning eight matches. One of those wins came in the 2023 Australian Open final, where Sabalenka won in three sets.After the match, Sabalenka spoke about the win and praised her opponent.""I’m super happy with the win, she’s a really tough opponent, she was playing really incredible tennis throughout the whole week,"" Sabalenka said.There was a delay early in the match when Sabalenka was given a hindrance call for grunting during the fourth game. The decision led to a video review and boos from the crowd. Sabalenka lost the point but regained control and broke serve early in the second set to close out the match.Svitolina said events in Ukraine put the result into perspective.“People are really living horrible and terrifying lives in Ukraine, so I should not be allowed to really be sad because I’m a very, very lucky person,” the 31-year-old said.In the other semi-final, Rybakina beat sixth seed Jessica Pegula of the United States 6-3, 7-6 (9/7). The match lasted one hour and 40 minutes. Rybakina did not drop a set in the tournament and had earlier defeated second seed Iga Swiatek in the quarter-finals.","Belarusian world no.1 aryna sabalenka defeated ukraine’s elina svitolina 6-2, 6-3 in the australian open semi-final on thursday.

Bangladesh crash out of U19 World Cup; BCB flags 'unfair schedule' by ICC,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/cricket/news/bangladesh-crash-out-of-u19-world-cup-bcb-flags-unfair-schedule-by-icc/articleshow/127779209.cms,"File photo

Bangladesh’s campaign at the Under-19 ongoing World Cup has ended amid criticism from the country’s cricket board over match scheduling and travel arrangements. The Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) has accused the International Cricket Council (ICC) of unfair scheduling, saying repeated travel affected the team during the tournament.The issue comes at a time when the BCB has already been at odds with the ICC following its decision not to send the senior national team to India for the T20 World Cup, after which Bangladesh were replaced by Scotland. Now, BCB game development coordinator Habibul Bashar has raised concerns about the U19 team’s travel plan during the World Cup.""More than the approach, I think our calculations were lacking [against England and India]. But this [travel schedule] is something I want to highlight, even if people think I'm making excuses,"" Habibul told Bangladesh news outlet The Daily Star.He added, ""To avoid the boys getting too tired before the India match, the BCB actually paid for an internal flight out of its own pocket because the bus journey was too long and direct flights were scarce.""As per The Daily Star report, Bangladesh head coach Naveed Nawaz and several players expressed frustration over the schedule.The team had to travel from Harare to Bulawayo, a journey of nearly nine hours by bus during the monsoon season, ahead of their opening group match.Due to the importance of matches against India and New Zealand, the BCB arranged and paid for internal flights. However, the travel demands continued, with the team returning to Harare by bus for their match against the USA on January 23, before travelling again for the Super Six game against England in Bulawayo on January 26.“The schedule was very unfair to us. During the initial schedule, we were supposed to play two of our warm-up matches in Masvingo and travel to Bulawayo, which is a four-hour drive, for our opening two group-stage matches. Later, they [ICC] suddenly changed the schedule, and it meant we had to play two of our warm-up games at different venues, travelling back and forth,” Bashar said.He added, “We notified them [of the travel burden] before the tournament started. We asked them to move our practice games to avoid the back-and-forth travel, but they didn't listen. Once the tournament starts, you can't really change these things.”",Bangladesh cricket board (bcb) has accused the international cricket council (icc) of unfair scheduling.

NBA court safety talks between the league and the Cavaliers move forward



Luka Doncic injury reignites NBA court safety questions



Is Luka Doncic alright?



Luka Doncic’s visit to Cleveland took an unexpected turn Wednesday night. The game shifted the attention from basketball to player safety inside Rocket Arena. A frightening fall near the sideline left the Los Angeles Lakers star dealing with left ankle soreness. The incident has reportedly forced the NBA to confront a long-discussed structural concern tied to the Cavaliers’ court design.Within hours, league officials and the Cavaliers moved toward formal discussions, turning a near-miss involving one of the game’s biggest stars into a league-wide topic. Doncic walked out of the court and headed to the locker room, but returned later, assuring that he was alright. Still, many questioned the court, including Lakers head coach JJ Redick.The NBA and Cleveland Cavaliers are scheduled to discuss potential changes to Rocket Arena’s raised court following Luka Doncic’s fall, according to The Athletic. A league spokesperson confirmed the renewed dialogue, stating, “While improvements have been made to the arena floor over the years to address this issue, the NBA and the Cavaliers are revisiting the situation given the incident last night.”Cleveland remains the only NBA team with a court elevated roughly 10 inches above the rubber mat covering the hockey rink below.Floor seats sit on that rubber surface, creating a visible gap along the sideline. Doncic stepped backward into that opening while landing from a shot attempt.The Lakers became the second visiting team to file a formal complaint. The Miami Heat raised similar concerns in November 2023 after guard Dru Smith suffered a season-ending knee injury in the same area. The National Basketball Players Association has resumed discussions with the league, describing the setup as a player safety concern.Cavaliers officials maintain the court meets league standards. A team spokesperson said, “The basketball court layout and design at Rocket Arena is fully compliant with NBA rules and has been in place for [20-plus] years, with ongoing collaboration and regular evaluation between our organization, the league and independent flooring experts to support player safety and performance.”Coaches across the league echoed familiar concerns after Wednesday’s scare. Lakers coach JJ Redick did not hold back, saying, “It is absolutely a safety hazard. And I don't know why it's still like that. I don't. You know, you can lodge formal complaints. A lot of times you don't see any change when you lodge a formal complaint.”The issue stands out because most NBA arenas either place courts closer to the underlying surface or position courtside seats directly on the playing floor. Cleveland’s configuration leaves room for missteps, even if incidents remain rare.Doncic returned to the game after heading to the locker room and finished with 29 points, easing immediate fears. Afterward, he reflected on the moment, saying, “It wasn’t a great feeling, and, looking back at the video, I think I got a little bit lucky.”He remains questionable for Friday’s game in Washington due to ankle soreness. His availability will be monitored closely.",Lakers star luka doncic fell near the sideline during wednesday's game in cleveland.

Stefon Diggs highlights Terrell Williams’ return inspires Patriots ahead of Super Bowl

The New England Patriots are heading back to the Super Bowl, and this season has been about more than wins and stats. Behind the victories, the locker room has rallied around a story of resilience. Terrell Williams, the team’s defensive coordinator, battled prostate cancer earlier this season. His return to the sidelines for Super Bowl LX has inspired every player on the roster.The Patriots’ season was remarkable. After back-to-back 4-13 seasons, QB Drake Maye threw for 4,394 yards and 31 touchdowns, and the team went 9-0 on the road, a first in NFL history. But it was New England’s defense, shaped by Williams’ schemes, that carried them in the playoffs, including a 10-7 AFC Championship win over the Denver Broncos.Patriots WR Stefon Diggs spoke at Gillette Stadium about the impact of Williams’ comeback. He said, “This team has been through a lot. A lot of guys have had family issues, things happen, and health issues. Another road warrior. We have got a lot of love and respect for Coach T and his strength.""Williams, 51, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in September 2025. During his treatment, linebackers coach Zak Kuhr took over play-calling duties, but Williams remained involved in game planning and team meetings.His return for the Super Bowl adds both stability and inspiration to a defense that allowed just 26 points over three playoff games.Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel shared that defensive coordinator Terrell Williams will travel with the team to Santa Clara for the Super Bowl. He’s doing good,” HC said. “He’s excited about travelling with us. I appreciate you asking. Doing well, so we’re excited about having him.”The Patriots face the Seattle Seahawks in Super Bowl LX on February 7, 2026, in San Francisco. While the matchup promises fireworks, Williams’ return is the emotional core of the team. For New England, his presence is a reminder that resilience, unity, and determination define a season just as much as touchdowns and sacks.","New england patriots head coach mike vrabel shared that defensive coordinator terrell williams will travel with the team to santa clara.

Why Kyle Tucker Would Have Fit Toronto Blue Jays’ Long-Term Plan

Toronto Blue Jays (Image Source - Getty Images)

What Each Side Would Have Gained

The Risks That Would Have Come With It

If Kyle Tucker had reached the open market instead of signing with the Los Angeles Dodgers in January 2026, the Toronto Blue Jays would likely have emerged as one of the most aggressive teams in pursuit.Tucker is one of the rare players who checks every box. He brings power without selling out his approach, plays strong defense in the outfield, and is still firmly in his prime. Players like that almost never become available, which is why his hypothetical free agency would have reshaped conversations across the league. Toronto, facing growing pressure after several playoff appearances that failed to produce a deep run, would have been well positioned to act.The Blue Jays have hovered on the edge of true contention for years. They’ve had talent, depth, and pitching, but the lineup has often lacked a single, game-altering presence who changes how opponents plan an entire series. Tucker fits that role cleanly. He’s not just another bat in the order; he’s the type of hitter who forces pitchers to work differently and reshapes how defenses align.Timing would have mattered as much as talent. With the Houston Astros managing payroll constraints and Tucker nearing the most expensive years of his career, the idea of him becoming available had already loosened the market.For Toronto, this would not have been about adding depth or chasing marginal gains. It would have been a direct attempt to raise the team’s ceiling and move from contender to legitimate title threat.Any discussion around Kyle Tucker begins with contract reality. Industry expectations suggest his next deal could comfortably exceed $400 million, a figure that would place him among baseball’s highest-paid players. For Houston, moving him before that point would have meant gaining young, controllable talent while avoiding a massive long-term obligation.Toronto, meanwhile, would have seen a rare opening. The organization has both the prospect depth and the competitive urgency to justify a major swing. While any deal would have required real sacrifice, either top prospects or players ready for everyday roles, the payoff would have been immediate. This would have been the type of move that defines an era rather than supplements it.From Toronto Blue Jays’ point of view, adding Kyle Tucker would have solved multiple problems at once. He offers consistent middle-of-the-order production, with a track record of strong averages, power, and run creation. That kind of reliability has been uneven in recent Blue Jays lineups, especially when games tighten late in the season.There’s also the matter of presence. Tucker carries star weight. His arrival would have sent a clear message to both the clubhouse and the fanbase that the front office was willing to push beyond comfort to chase a championship.For Tucker, Toronto would have represented a chance to step into a major market with a competitive roster already in place. The environment would have supported both performance and profile, while positioning him for the type of long-term contract his production suggests is coming.The cost would not have been light. Toronto would have needed to part with valuable future assets, potentially thinning out depth that matters over a long season. There’s also the reality of Tucker’s recent injury history, including time missed in 2024, which adds uncertainty to any long-term commitment.For Houston, moving on from a cornerstone player would have meant an immediate hit to star power and lineup balance. The success of such a move would hinge entirely on how quickly and effectively the return pieces developed.Tucker himself would have faced the pressure that comes with a new league, a demanding market, and heightened expectations. Toronto is not a quiet place to struggle, especially for a player brought in to change outcomes.Had Tucker not already committed to the Dodgers, Toronto would have been one of the clearest teams ready to move first and spend big. The fit made sense in terms of timing, roster construction, and competitive goals. While the risks would have been real on every side, so would the upside.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Mets exploring blockbuster move for $116.5 million Arizona Diamondbacks star following Jeff McNeil exit Deals like this don’t just alter a single roster. They change how a team is viewed for years. For the Blue Jays, a player like Kyle Tucker could have been the difference between staying close and finally breaking through.","Kyle tucker is one of the rare players who checks every box.

Joe Brady credits Sean McDermott for shaping his coaching journey

LIVE: Head Coach Joe Brady Introductory Press Conference | January 29, 2026

Josh Allen remains central to Bills’ future

Joe Brady has officially begun his journey as the new head coach of the Buffalo Bills, and his first public comments made one thing very clear that respect for the past remains central to his vision for the future. During his introductory press conference, he took time to praise former head coach Sean McDermott and also acknowledged the pressure that comes with taking over a Super Bowl hungry franchise.McDermott was fired after nine seasons in charge, a decision that surprised many given the consistency the Bills showed under his leadership. Brady, who worked closely with McDermott for four years, made it clear that he does not view the transition as a break from the past, but rather as a continuation.Speaking to reporters, Brady called McDermott a major influence on his career and leadership style. He revealed that McDermott gave him “the opportunity of a lifetime” when he joined the Bills in 2022, allowing him to work closely with quarterback Josh Allen and grow within the organization.He highlighted the lessons he learned from McDermott, including resilience, discipline, and setting high standards inside the building.He stressed that the success Buffalo enjoyed over the past nine years “matters deeply” and deserves recognition.Rather than distancing himself from the previous regime, Brady said he plans to build on the foundation McDermott established. According to him, the culture of accountability and competitiveness already exists his job is to elevate it further.While he was reflecting on the past, he did not shy away from addressing the pressure that comes with his new role. He openly admitted that he is stepping into a much stronger situation than McDermott inherited when he first took over the Bills.With an established quarterback in Josh Allen and a roster built to contend, expectations are naturally higher. He said he understands that reality and is not intimidated by it. Instead, he described the challenge as something he is ready to embrace fully.“I didn’t take this job to shy away from expectations,” Brady said, adding that he understands what is required to take the team to the next level.Brady’s relationship with Josh Allen will be central to his success as head coach. Having coached Allen closely in recent seasons, Brady enters the role with trust already established as a key advantage for a first-time head coach.Even as Allen continues to recover from a foot injury, Brady’s comments suggested confidence in both the quarterback’s leadership and the team’s long-term direction. The goal, Brady emphasized, is to create sustained success rather than quick fixes.As the Bills turned the page, Brady’s tone struck a balance between gratitude and ambition. By honoring Sean McDermott’s legacy while embracing the pressure ahead, the new head coach signaled a steady and respectful transition one that Bills fans hope will finally lead to a Super Bowl breakthrough.","Joe brady has officially begun his role as the new head coach of the buffalo bills.

Drake Maye injury update ahead of Super Bowl LX

New England Patriots quarterback Drake Maye appeared on the injury report at a delicate moment, listed as limited as preparations begin for Super Bowl LX. With the season nearing its final chapter, any uncertainty surrounding the Patriots’ most important player quickly draws attention.The designation surfaced days after New England’s narrow AFC Championship victory, adding an extra layer of intrigue to a matchup already heavy with stakes.Maye is managing a right shoulder issue following the Patriots’ 10-7 win over the Denver Broncos in the AFC Championship game. Although the team did not hold a formal practice on Wednesday, Maye was still labeled limited, an indication of how his workload would have been handled if preparations were underway.The shoulder injury is believed to have occurred late in the third quarter when Maye was tackled by Broncos safety Talanoa Hufanga at the end of a 13-yard run. He landed hard on his throwing shoulder but stayed in the game, ultimately scoring New England’s lone touchdown in snowy conditions that neutralized both offenses.While the injury report raised concerns externally, Maye has offered reassurance. In an interview with WEEI in Boston, the Patriots quarterback explained that the soreness is not tied to a single play.“I’m feeling good. I got in some extra rest. I don’t think it’s from the game,” Maye said. “I think it’s just the buildup of throwing, including training camp, 30 weeks straight of throwing, and four days a week. It can add up. But I got some extra rest, and I’m feeling good and ready to go for the Super Bowl.”Maye echoed similar confidence when speaking to reporters after the AFC Championship game, stressing that physical wear is unavoidable this late in the season. Patriots head coach Mike Vrabel supported that view, noting that no player on the roster is fully healthy at this stage, reinforcing the idea that Maye’s listing is more about caution than availability.Seattle enters Super Bowl LX with its own quarterback situation to monitor. Sam Darnold has been limited by an oblique injury but showed no decline in production during the NFC Championship, throwing for 346 yards and three touchdowns in a win over the Los Angeles Rams.The Patriots and Seahawks last met in the Super Bowl in 2015. A decade later, Drake Maye and Sam Darnold are set to lead their teams on the same stage, with health and durability quietly shaping the build-up to kickoff.","Drake maye listed as limited with shoulder concern ahead of super bowl lx.

Zlatan Ibrahimović: The Lion’s share

Helena Seger: The business brain

In the world of football, Zlatan Ibrahimović is a legend. Whether it's his larger-than-life personality, where he refers to himself as a ""Lion"" and a ""God,"" or his craftsmanship in the field, he walks the walk. But behind the legendary Swede is not just a legacy in the football field but a financial empire built on a unique partnership with his longtime partner and the woman he credits with ""taming"" him, Helena Seger. As of present, the couple's combined net worth is estimated to be around $320 to $350 million.In the world of sports, many wives and girlfriends are known primarily for their association with the athletes. But Helena Seger was a self-made millionaire long before Ibrahimović became a global icon. Their wealth isn't just ""football money"" but a blend of elite sports earnings and savvy venture capital.Zlatan Ibrahimović, after a remarkable 24-year run, hung up his boots in 2023. Even so, he's still counted among the most financially successful athletes of all time. His considerable wealth stems from both his playing days and savvy investments. Over the course of his two-decade career, playing for teams such as AC Milan, PSG, Manchester United , and LA Galaxy, he's raked in hundreds of millions from salaries and bonuses.Beyond football, he holds a substantial share in the Swedish club Hammarby IF and has put significant money into eSports and gaming ventures, including Isbit Games. Today, he's an operating partner at RedBird Capital Partners and a senior advisor to AC Milan, securing a consistent income stream after his retirement. He also has long-standing deals with Nike, Volvo, and Vitamin Well that continue to yield dividends. At the time of writing, his net worth is estimated at around $190 million.Helena Seger, Ibrahimović's longtime partner, is often described as the architect of the ""Brand Zlatan."" Though they are not married, the couple shares two sons together. A former model and actress, Seger transitioned into high-level business roles for major Swedish brands and has held prominent marketing and management roles at global brands like H&M and Swedish Match. Her current net worth is around $130–$160 million.She also manages their family's extensive real estate holdings, which include luxury properties in Stockholm, Milan, Paris, and a private island in Lake Mälaren, Sweden. She once famously stated, ""I had my own career and wealth when I met him... I didn't need the footballer to feed me."" She has also revealed why they are not married even though they have been together for so long, saying she doesn't want to lose her sense of independence because of marriage.Zlatan Ibrahimović may be the face of the brand, but the balance sheet suggests it is very much a joint venture. What sets the Ibrahimović-Seger duo apart is their financial longevity. Unlike many athletes who struggle after the final whistle, Ibrahimović's transition into private equity and Seger’s background in corporate marketing have turned their household into a diversified investment firm.

Which teams should sell before the NHL deadline? Three clear candidates revealed,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/which-teams-should-sell-before-the-nhl-deadline-three-clear-candidates-revealed/articleshow/127781797.cms,"Andrei Kuzmenko (Image Source: Getty)

What selling mode mean at the NHL Trade Deadline

What is the state of the selling mode at the deadline?

With the NHL Trade Deadline just around the corner and the playoff scenario starting to take shape, there are a handful of teams too far behind to have a chance to compete at all in this season in terms of winning a Stanley Cup.Trading of old assets with future value prospects, draft picks, or cap flexibility is usually the best action to take in the case of franchises at that spot. In the recent analysis, there are three teams that have found themselves in that category squarely and must seriously think of going into seller mode before the deadline.The Los Angeles Kings have had a hard time getting their bearings in the Western Conference and are on the outside looking in as the race narrows. Although their status remains alive mathematically, the fact that they have failed to make consecutive successes and have been known to falter at the most critical points indicates that they can hardly achieve a postseason berth without a major turnaround.Offensive worth and experience from players like Andrei Kuzmenko and Corey Perry have proven valuable and enviable late in the season.The New Jersey Devils, who were viewed as potential rivals in the Eastern Conference, have had a dismal season due to injuries and lapses in concentration.Absence of part of the key players, including Jack Hughes, during the season, the lapses in the defence, and the non-enthusiastic goaltending have not allowed them to gain momentum.In a club with high expectations, such regression might be a bitter pill, but it will also create an opportunity to retool.Winnipeg Jets entered the season with the hope of carrying the same team into the previous season, but the lack of scoring and the richness of the team have placed the team at the bottom of the Western Conference. His stars, including Connor Hellebuyck, are still performing highly, but the player does not have enough players to back him with to enable him to compile wins. Such a player like Jonathan Toews, who had retired and returned to his hometown, has an emotional and competitive price.It is never easy to transition into the seller mode for a franchise or fan base. It involves coming to terms with the fact that the competition season might be over and focusing more on the future rather than the present marginal benefitsThe following chapter in an organization is usually characterized by deadline deals. In the case of these three teams, proactive selling may be the initial move to restructuring and success in the future.","The nhl trade deadline is just around the corner.

Myles Garrett reacts silently to Browns’ coaching decisions



The Cleveland Browns’ offseason is off to a rocky start, with a head coaching search that hasn’t gone as planned. After several top candidates removed themselves from consideration, the franchise eventually hired Todd Monken, former Baltimore Ravens offensive coordinator, over Jim Schwartz and Nate Scheelhaase. This decision has already triggered significant reactions within the organization.Jim Schwartz, a top candidate to return as defensive coordinator, told the Browns he won’t be back for the 2026 season. The news has shaken the team, especially the defensive players who performed well under his system. Myles Garrett, who set a sack record in 2025 under Schwartz’s defense, shared a telling Instagram story following the announcement, signaling that the coaching drama could be affecting player morale.Ari Meirov of The 33rd Team shared Garrett’s post on X, which was just a photo with no caption. Even without words, it’s clear Garrett is frustrated, if not upset, about the coaching upheaval. As the Browns attempt to stabilize their leadership with Monken, the star defensive end’s reaction underscores the potential challenges ahead. Garrett is signed with the Browns for $40 million a year through 2030. Still, any tension between him and the team’s management could affect the locker room and on-field performance.Schwartz’s departure wasn’t a complete surprise, but it still leaves Cleveland in a tricky spot. He was seen as the top choice to keep the defense steady, and his knowledge of the roster could have made Monken’s transition smoother. Now, the Browns must rebuild that stability while managing how players react. Veterans like Garrett could help guide the team, but early signs point to some frustration.The Browns’ decision shows a clear plan, but it comes with risks. Monken now has to install his offensive system while overseeing a defense in flux and keeping the locker room calm. As the Browns look to compete in 2026, keeping their star players together during all these changes will be key, making this offseason one of the most closely watched in recent team history.","Cleveland browns hired todd monken as their new head coach.

Mattias Samuelsson's breakout season powers Sabres' resurgence

Leadership and maturity fuel sustained team success

The Buffalo Sabres have gone from one of the hottest teams in the NHL over the last two months to 39 points out of 46 possible in their last 23 games, with a record of 30-17-5. Mattias Samuelsson leads the Sabres on this strong run with his emergence, providing an anchor both defensively and offensively as they attempt to end their 14-year playoff drought.So far in this season, Mattias Samuelsson has had a career-defining season by recording 31 total points over 50 games (8 goals and 23 assists) with an NHL-best +27 rating for defenders. His number of points this year is significantly higher than his 43 total points through 212 games, as he’s become an unexpected offensive contributor to his already established, strong defensive game. In addition to his impressive point totals, Samuelsson has appeared in 48 consecutive games. He is on pace to set a personal best in hits with approximately 131 from his current total hits this year.His consistent play has been very beneficial to Buffalo’s fifth-ranked penalty kill, as they started the season slowly but have remained competitive. Furthermore, he has stepped up to perform in the absence of other injured defensemen and has become one of the most important players on the team through his contributions in every circumstance, and is viewed as one of the top candidates for the most improved player award this season.Samuelsson emphasized the importance of remaining aggressive and not getting complacent in the highly competitive Eastern Conference, where a couple of losses can drastically change everything. The young Sabres are growing up this year – they already have 13 comeback wins, which is a huge improvement over last year's abysmal performance; plus, they don't panic when they fall behind early in games.This new mindset represents a significant change from years past, when the group would often fall into long slumps after falling behind early in games. With 30 games remaining on their schedule and currently holding down 3rd place in the Atlantic Division, Buffalo has a real chance of making it to the playoffs and competing well once they do, as long as their leaders (like Samuelsson) continue playing well.",The buffalo sabres have gone from one of the hottest teams in the nhl over the last two months to 39 points out of 46 possible in their last 23 games.

Milwaukee Bucks’ form without their best player

What this means for fantasy and betting

against the Washington Wizards. He is out with a right calf strain and was ruled out before game day. This is not a game-time call. He is officially listed as out and will not be available for Milwaukee’s road game in Washington.The league’s injury report marks Giannis Antetokounmpo as “Out - Right Calf; Strain” for the game at Capital One Arena. There is no questionable tag next to his name. He is not close to returning for this game.Gary Harris and Kevin Porter Jr. are also sidelined, leaving the team short on regular rotation players.Giannis hurt his right calf in a recent game. Since then, he has missed several matchups and has also been ruled out of the upcoming All-Star Game. He said after the injury that he expected to be out around four to six weeks. That means this is not a short break. It is a longer recovery from a soft-tissue injury. Because of that timeline, a return before the trade deadline looks unlikely.The Milwaukee Bucks come into this game with an 18-27 record. They have lost six of their last seven games. Without Giannis, the offense creates fewer easy points at the rim and in transition.No one else on the roster can replace what he does in those areas.Washington is 11-34 and dealing with injuries of its own, including one to Trae Young. Even so, Milwaukee is missing its main scorer, best interior defender, and most reliable playmaker.Giannis Antetokounmpo cannot be used in fantasy lineups tonight. His absence lowers Milwaukee’s expected scoring.

Former NBA champion Lamar Odom enters rehab in wake of DUI arrest

2x NBA champion Lamar Odom had been previously arrested for substance abuse

Former NBA star and Los Angeles Clippers player, Lamar Odom , was arrested earlier on Saturday, January 17, for violating traffic rules. Not only did he exceed the speed limit, but he was also caught red-handed for improper lane changing. Following his arrest, he entered into a 30-day rehabilitation program in Los Angeles for Marijuana addiction.Lamar Odom has a history of substance abuse, including an overdose, causing a near-death experience in 2015. A rehabilitation would be a better option for the former NBA star to maintain his mental well-being and state of awareness. Let us have a detailed look at what actually happened that made him enter a rehab unit.According to Lamar Odom’s manager, Gina Rodriguez, the NBA veteran has decided to go through rehab, which could help him get away from hard drugs in the near future. He was arrested back on January 17 for speeding and improper changing of lanes. He was driving at more than 41 miles per hour. Moreover, after further investigation, the police informed that his car “reeked of weed” after they pulled him over.Later, Odom himself admitted to smoking earlier that day. His manager, Rodriguez, said, “After a recent incident, he took a step back to reflect and address triggers he’s been dealing with”.She also said how Odom wanted to “reset and focus on his health” and how it was his “personal decision”. “Lamar is grateful for the support and is committed to moving forward in a healthy, positive way”, Rodriguez added.Back in 2013, Lamar Odom, a former NBA star and veteran, was arrested for DUI in California. As a part of his punishment, he was even asked to pay a $1800 penalty for driving below the speed limit and showing obvious signs of intoxication. Odom also received three years of probation, during which he had to attend a three-month alcohol education program.However, in 2015, lines were crossed when Lamar Odom was hospitalized for his near-death overdose of hard drugs, including alcohol, in a Las Vegas brothel. In 2019, he wrote, “My heart stopped twice, ""I had twelve seizures and six strokes. My lungs collapsed and my kidneys ruptured. I was on life support. Everyone I’d ever loved was looking at me through bleary eyes”. For a person with a background of avid substance use, a rehabilitation center seems to be the best fit.","Lamar odom was arrested on january 17 for speeding and improper changing of lanes.

Jayden Daniels and his mother, Regina Jackson, spark outrage with a heartwarming clip



Regina Jackson has been a strong support to Jayden Daniels



Jayden Daniels, the 25 year old popular quarterback of the Washington Commanders, went through a series of injuries this year but he had his mother, Regina Jackson, by his side as she supported him through tough days.Over the last few years, Jayden Daniels has shown the world how he loves to pamper his mother, Regina Jackson, but this has raised eyebrows among fans. Now, a resurfaced clip of the two has sparked outrage and divided fans.A few hours ago, a heartwarming clip of Jayden Daniels celebrating his mother on Mother’s Day 2024, by taking her shopping at Neiman Marcus, sparked panic among fans.The clip might have been a collaboration that the Washington Commanders’ star player had with the brand. While the clip is itself heartwarming and shows a close bond between the two, fans are divided about it.A fan by the username @ShevyBoiMusic wrote, “That lady needs a husband, She thinks her son is her husband”, while another fan by the username @ogshavers posted, “This sh*t getting creepy.”A third fan by the username @kitfistokesherb wrote, “It’s cool that he loves his mom a lot but stop loving her in our face so much, dude.”However, neither Jayden Daniels nor his mother, Regina Jackson, has commented on the criticisms yet as they continue to remain silent.This isnt the first time that the popular mother son duo have been criticised for the close bond they share.Back in May 2025, Regina Jackson opened up her bond with Jayden Daniels on The Pivot podcast.Jayden Daniels’ mother said, “The thing is, he doesn’t know what he doesn’t know and he knows football and he does it very well… but he doesn’t know the business world,” she said. “He doesn’t know the predators or the vultures that could be out there.”Regina Jackson added, “So he feels very comfortable in knowing that not only am I educated and qualified to do it, I’m also his mom.”","Jayden daniels' heartwarming moment with his mother regina jackson spark outrage about their bond.

Roman Reigns continues to define WWE dominance

Brock Lesnar and Cody Rhodes headline the money matchups

The WWE Royal Rumble 2026 is already poised to be one of the most exciting editions of the over-the-top rope classic in years. As WrestleMania 42 approaches, the men's Royal Rumble match should see a strong mix of current stars and legends from this generation. Many of the biggest names in WWE are on the cusp of battling one another for the right to headline WrestleMania, and fans around the globe have their eyes firmly trained on this year.This year goes beyond quelling championship aspirations, though, as the Rumble is designed to showcase WWE's biggest global draws and highest earners. Wrestlers like Roman Reigns, Brock Lesnar, and Cody Rhodes not only draw eyeballs into the ring, but they also represent the lowest-paid wrestlers in the company. It lends credibility to the event and also reiterates the bottom-line influence of WWE’s elite talent.As we move toward the Royal Rumble 2026, one of the biggest names in professional wrestling remains Roman Reigns. He, billed as the face of WWE for the better part of the last 10 years, still garners huge amounts of fan interest and television viewership. Any return to the Royal Rumble automatically makes that match a bigger deal, because every time a former Undisputed Champion sets foot in the ring, the title picture gets turned upside down.Financially, Roman Reigns stands among WWE’s elite. His estimated net worth is believed to be around $18 million, earned through long-term WWE contracts, merchandise sales, premium live event bonuses, and media appearances. Reigns’ ability to maintain star power while working a selective schedule has only increased his value to the company. If he advances deep into the Rumble match, it could signal another headline WrestleMania run.The Beast Incarnate himself remains the most well-built and bankable WWE talent in the company's long history. Lesnar is still a special attraction whenever he shows up, known for his explosive in-ring style and crossover fame from MMA. This is estimated to be in the range of $20 to $25 million, putting him among the richest WWE superstars ever. Even sporadic appearances create big news, which is why he's a major player in the Royal Rumble landscape.Fans can see that Cody Rhodes is all that WWE believes their contemporary victory. Rhodes restored his status as an A-level star and now occupies main-event territory as the top babyface. Estimates put his net worth at over $8 million, due to stable merchandising and high-end event revenues, along with WWE management's long-term faith in his booking. Again, he has a shot at the title after his Royal Rumble showing and is back in line for WrestleMania success.",The wwe royal rumble 2026 is poised to be one of the most exciting editions of the over-the-top rope classic in years.

What the Rolex agreement means for LIV Golf’s future

LIV Golf has secured a surprising partnership with luxury watch brand Rolex. The deal links one of the PGA Tour’s biggest sponsors with LIV Golf, but with clear limits. Rolex will not appear as a full on-course sponsor at LIV Golf events. Instead, the agreement focuses only on premium hospitality access. The move signals growing acceptance of LIV Golf while also showing that major brands remain cautious. According to reports shared by golf industry insiders, Rolex will not place its iconic clocks on LIV Golf courses.This is a major shift from its long-standing role on the PGA Tour, where Rolex branding is highly visible. The agreement allows Rolex customers to attend LIV Golf events through exclusive hospitality experiences. It does not include broadcast branding, on-course signage, or title sponsorship rights. This structure protects Rolex’s global image while still testing a relationship with LIV Golf. For LIV Golf, even a limited association with a $12 billion brand is seen as a major step forward. The league has recently retained top players and continues to push for Official World Golf Ranking status.The Rolex deal shows that LIV Golf is attracting interest from elite sponsors, even if cautiously.By focusing on hospitality rather than branding, Rolex avoids public alignment with the league’s ongoing disputes with traditional golf bodies. At the same time, LIV Golf gains validation by partnering with a luxury brand trusted across professional sports. Industry analysts note that this type of deal could open the door to similar partnerships. Other sponsors may follow with low-risk agreements before committing fully. For LIV Golf, this approach builds credibility without forcing brands into controversial exposure. It also strengthens LIV Golf’s appeal to high-end fans who value premium experiences.LIV Golf's contract with Rolex solidifies the assumption that LIV is on solid ground. This contract backs many LIV players like Rahm and DeChambeau to remain committed to LIV Golf for the long term. Other players, like Koepka, went back to how they played before LIV Golf. As this loyalty has been essential in keeping LIV Golf moving forward at such a crucial time, we know that if LIV Golf earns an Official World Golf Ranking, the commercial value of LIV Golf will skyrocket, and this may lead Rolex and others to increase their future sponsorship involvement. For now, Rolex and LIV Golf have a selective relationship regarding this partnership that is a good sign for LIV Golf's future. The Rolex limited partnership, combined with some of the professional golf world's previous reluctance to partner with LIV Golf, demonstrates how much progress LIV Golf is making in the professional game of golf. There is a lot of cautious optimism about how the major brands perceive LIV Golf in their respective sponsorship strategies.","Liv golf has secured a surprising partnership with luxury watch brand rolex.

Broncos QB Bo Nix fires back at Sean Payton for crossing a line on injury update,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/broncos-qb-bo-nix-fires-back-at-sean-payton-for-crossing-a-line-on-injury-update/articleshow/127777021.cms,"Image via IMAGN

What Sean Payton said about the injury

Bo Nix pushes back publicly

Denver Broncos quarterback Bo Nix has broken his silence after head coach Sean Payton made public comments about his ankle injury, turning a routine medical update into an uncomfortable public exchange.The disagreement comes days after the Broncos’ season ended in a narrow 10-7 loss to the New England Patriots in the AFC Championship Game. Nix missed the game after fracturing his ankle late in the Divisional Round win over the Buffalo Bills, an injury that required surgery and sidelined him at the worst possible moment.While addressing the media after the season-ending loss, Payton suggested that Nix’s ankle injury was not entirely unexpected. The Broncos coach said doctors found a condition that made the ankle “predisposed” to injury, adding that it was “not a matter of if, but when.”Payton also referenced Nix’s past ankle issues from his high school and college days, framing the injury as something that was likely to happen sooner or later. Though the comments appeared to be made in a matter-of-fact tone, they quickly drew attention around the league.Nix did not agree with that assessment and made his feelings clear when he met reporters later in the week.The 25-year-old quarterback directly contradicted Payton’s remarks, insisting there was no pre-existing condition.“Nothing was predisposed. Nothing was there originally,” Nix said. “It was just an unfortunate landing.”More importantly, Nix questioned why details of his medical and surgical history were discussed publicly at all. He said he did not believe that information should have been shared, especially when it was not fully accurate.“I don’t think he really should share how many surgeries I’ve had in the past,” Nix added, noting that his coach did not have the full details.The situation has drawn extra scrutiny because of the timing.
