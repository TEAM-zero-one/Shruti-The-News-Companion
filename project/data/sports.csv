Team Canada’s GM Don Sweeney confirms long-term role for Connor Bedard

Connor Bedard was left off Team Canada ’s roster for the 4 Nations Face-Off mainly due to his performance in his second NHL season.

However, he emphasized that Bedard remains a key part of Canada’s future, including possible participation in the 2026 Winter Olympics.“The experiences he’s going to go through (are important),"" Sweeney said before the tournament. ""The world championships he went through last year. Going through the second time around the league now, so to speak — in your second year, there’s some challenges associated with that. He’s working through that in a situation where he gets all the attention possible from the best players that he’s playing against each and every night.”""I think he’s living and breathing it right now, and it’s only going to help him to continue to build his resume, and we’re excited about that,”Sweeney added.Head Coach Jon Cooper echoed this, saying Bedard is part of the next generation of top Canadian players.

Taylor Swift won't perform at the Super Bowl until Travis Kelce retires

Taylor Swift is considering performing a halftime show for the NFL after her boyfriend Travis Kelce retires, according to a report by the Daily Mail.

And as long as Travis is in the league, the Chiefs have a chance to be in the game, so she is going to wait to do it till he is officially done.”Travis Kelce's NFL future remains uncertain after the Chiefs' Super Bowl LIX loss to the Philadelphia Eagles. Rumors about his retirement arose, and he said he would take time to decide on his New Heights podcast with his brother Jason Kelce.“I’m gonna take some time to figure it out,” Kelce said. “And I think I owe it to my teammates that if I do come back that it’s gonna be a wholehearted decision and I’m not half-assing it, and I’m fully here for them. I think I can play, it’s just whether or not I’m motivated or it’s the best decision for me as a man, as a human, as a person to take on all that responsibility.”Also Read: Travis Kelce is rumored to propose to Taylor Swift during their next upcoming romantic vacation Travis Kelce, a key player for the Kansas City offense, has seen a career-low 823 yards and three touchdowns this season.

have seemingly bounced back as they have secured a stunning win against theon Thursday night. At 40 years old, on the second night of a back-to-back, the four-time NBA champion, LeBron James delivered a jaw-dropping 40-point performance to lead the Los Angeles Lakers to a 121-112 win over the Portland Trail Blazers. His efforts left Lakers head coachboth stunned and inspired, as he showered James with praise following the game. LeBron James has recently dealt with lingering injuries and only confirmed fit to play hours before tipoff but showed no signs of slowing down. He shot an efficient 14-for-24 from the field, including 4-of-8 from beyond the arc, and added eight rebounds and four assists.Head coach JJ Redick , who has always been a vocal admirer of James’ work ethic and longevity, couldn’t hold back his admiration for the legend. Speaking to reporters in a post-game presser, he shared his honest thoughts on the King’s astonishing performance.“He really just defies anything that's normal, and not just the physical feats and the plays—it’s the mentality,” Redick said. “He is—I believe I saw the other day he's a billionaire—and he's playing on the second night of a back-to-back at 40 after 22 years with every record and every accolade.”Redick continued his witty remark, “And the kids will say that I'm glazing him. He's one of the greatest competitors. [Assistant coach] Nate [McMillan] and I were talking before the game—he's amazing to coach. He brings it every single day, he sets the standard for how you're supposed to approach this craft. That’s to me the most incredible thing—the mindset to do it, get up the next day, do it, over and over again.”James’ ability to maintain this level of excellence post-40 has been undeniably top of the word, according to fan analysts. For two decades, he has maintained his stature as a standout star and forged his legacy with a stunning resume to his name.Additionally, James has just added another milestone in his career. By playing his 1,542nd game, he passed Vince Carter to claim third place on the NBA’s all-time games played list. Now, only Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1,560) and Robert Parish (1,611) stand ahead of him. The 1 billion-rich athlete (per Forbes) is currently averaging 24.7 points per game, 7.7 rebounds, and 8.9 assists. James also holds the youngest and oldest NBA star to score 40 points in a game.Also Read: Los Angeles Lakers legend LeBron James creates another milestone surpassing Vince Carter A huge part of the Lakers’ success against Portland also came from Austin Reaves in the recent game against the Trail Blazers.

Anthony Edwards’ confident exchange with Barack Obama during Team USA event made headlines



Minnesota Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards has made a name for himself as one of the most promising young players in the NBA. The way the rising standout star has been playing his game led many to draw comparisons between Edwards and the legendary Michael Jordan . However, the 23-year-old guard has made it clear that he is not interested in being measured against the greatest player of all time.During All-Star Weekend, Anthony Edwards was asked about adding any of Michael Jordan ’s signature moves into his own game. Ant-Man did not hesitate to refute the comparison. “No moves, man. Shout out to MJ, he the GOAT. I just wish y’all would stop comparing me to him,” he said. Of course, Edwards appreciates the respect that comes with the comparison, but he seems to feel that it adds unnecessary pressure.Edwards has consistently shown that he wants to be recognized for his own unique style of play rather than living in the shadow of NBA legends.This isn’t the first time Edwards has downplayed his place in the sport. Despite being widely regarded as one of the NBA’s next big superstars, he doesn’t see himself as the future face of the league. When recently asked if he envisions himself as the league’s next top player, especially with legends like LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Stephen Curry nearing the end of their careers, his response was refreshingly candid, “No, not really.” Instead, Edwards pointed to San Antonio Spurs rookie sensation Victor Wembanyama, saying, “That’s what they got Wemby for.”He elaborated further in an interview with TNT, “I’m capable of being that guy. But I don’t want to be that guy, I’ll put it like that. I want to be the guy that just show up and hoop and just kill dudes and go home.” Despite being one of the top stars in the league, Edwards has been humble in his approach about the games he played over the years.Edwards' confidence isn’t just limited to his performances on the court. Recently, he made headlines for his bold exchange with former U.S. President Barack Obama during Netflix’s Court of Gold docuseries, which provided a behind-the-scenes look at Team USA’s preparations for the Paris Olympics.In one interesting moment, Obama jokingly asked Philadelphia 76ers star Joel Embiid about Edwards, saying, “What do you think about this young guy? He can hoop a little bit, huh?” Embiid, with a smile, responded, “Just a little bit.” But Edwards, never one to back down, immediately responded with his usual candid manner, “Nah, y’all better stand down. I’m the truth.”Also Read: Jimmy Butler addresses beef with Miami Heat after blockbuster trade to Golden State Warriors: “It didn’t end the way everybody hoped” The 23-year-old Minnesota Timberwolves star player has been one of the best in the league with astonishing stats already added to his name.

Team India undergoes intense training in Dubai ahead of Champions Trophy | Exclusive Visuals

India begin Champions Trophy prep | Rishabh Pant struck on knee

India's probable XI vs Bangladesh:

Hot favourites India will begin their Champions Trophy campaign against Bangladesh in Group A on Thursday, and with just four teams in each group of the eight-team competition, every game matters in the quest to finish in the top two to qualify for the semifinals.Besides Bangladesh, India's other competitors in the group are hosts and defending champions Pakistan as well as New Zealand.India, who will play all their matches in Dubai, have the advantage of playing the entire tournament at just one venue and the players won't have to adjust to different pitches, unlike the other seven teams who will play across four venues -- Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi in Pakistan as well as Dubai.But the first match remains tricky. Despite knowing the historical nature of the Dubai track to have something in it for both batters and bowlers, India will have to take a call on whether to go in with three spinners or three pacers from their spin-heavy 15-member squad.India suffered a blow just before the tournament, with ace fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah ruled out because of a back injury. And with Mohammed Shami only recently returning to the team after a year-long injury layoff and Arshdeep Singh short on ODI experience, India coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Rohit Sharma have work to do in order to pick the bowling combination they want to go ahead with.India have as many as five spinners in the squad; namely Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy, and all-rounders Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Washington Sundar. While the pace-bowling unit has Harshit Rana and all-rounder Hardik Pandya besides Shami and Arshdeep.The dew expected late in the evening in Dubai is one factor that may prevent India from picking three spinners as it makes it difficult to grip the dewy ball. But with Axar being used at No. 5 against England and doing well, his inclusion can give India the balance they seek with a left-handed batting option in the mix in top five.However, the batting order looks sorted as the likes of Rohit, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul pick themselves, unless the think-tank wants Rishabh Pant to do the wicketkeeping duties instead of Rahul, who did the job during the three-match ODI series against England just before the Champions Trophy.Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, KL Rahul (wk), Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Shami, Kuldeep Yadav, Arshdeep Singh","India will begin their champions trophy campaign against bangladesh in group a on thursday.
