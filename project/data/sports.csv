Is Rodgers headed for a coaching role in San Francisco?



Aaron Rodgers Caught Deeply Contemplating His Future On Beach | Pat McAfee Show

Why the 49ers and Why now?



Aaron Rodgers’ future in the NFL remains one of the biggest talking points in football. While teams like the Pittsburgh Steelers and New York Giants are rumored to be in the mix, a surprising alternative has emerged—coaching. Reports suggest Rodgers may step away from playing in 2025 and join the San Francisco 49ers ’ staff, potentially setting the stage for a major leadership role in the future.Rodgers has repeatedly dismissed the idea of coaching post-retirement, but circumstances change. As one of the most intelligent quarterbacks in NFL history, he possesses the strategic mind that could make him a successful coach. With insiders predicting that he may not suit up in 2025, some believe he could step into a coaching role with the 49ers, possibly positioning himself as Kyle Shanahan ’s eventual replacement.""While Kyle Shanahan is safe for the 2025 NFL season, there is a real chance that his future in 2026 is not,"" Marissa Myers noted. ""With that in mind, it presents the perfect opportunity for Rodgers to take the next step in his career, and enter the realm of coaching."" (via: Sporting News)Also Read: Steelers set to sign veteran QB in 2025 Free Agency, but it’s not who you think Shanahan has guided San Francisco to multiple deep playoff runs, but his tenure has also been marked by inconsistency. With four playoff misses in eight seasons, concerns about his long-term viability continue to grow. Critics argue that his inability to adapt is holding the 49ers back. Rodgers, a four-time MVP, could bring a fresh perspective and serve as a mentor for young quarterback Brock Purdy, helping the team transition into its next phase.Adding to the intrigue, Rodgers’ California roots make this move even more compelling. A lifelong 49ers fan, he once dreamed of being drafted by them. If he transitions into coaching, leading his hometown team would be a full-circle moment in his storied career.Rodgers remains unpredictable, keeping fans and analysts on edge. But if he decides to swap his helmet for a headset, the 49ers could be his next big move, one that shakes up the NFL landscape and redefines his legacy.","Reports suggest aaron rodgers may step away from playing in 2025 and join the san francisco 49ers ’ staff.

""Denver was adamant about retaining Porter amid NBA trade rumors this season,""

The Los Angeles Lakers are reportedly considering a major roster shakeup as they weigh the possibility of parting ways with Austin Reaves to pursue Denver Nuggets star Michael Porter Jr. The move, which could significantly bolster the Lakers' three-point shooting, comes amid their push to solidify their position in the Western Conference playoff race.Since acquiring Luka Doncic in a blockbuster trade on February 2, the Lakers have shown flashes of brilliance but have struggled recently, losing their last three games. Despite the setbacks, the team remains in contention for the No. 2 seed in the West. However, their three-point shooting has been a glaring weakness this season, with the team shooting just 35.7% from beyond the arc under head coach JJ Redick.This has led to speculation that the Los Angeles Lakers may target Michael Porter Jr., a proven three-point specialist, in the offseason. Porter, who signed a $179 million contract with the Nuggets, has been one of the league's most consistent long-range shooters since entering the NBA. As a rookie, he shot an impressive 42.2% from downtown and has maintained a high level of efficiency, connecting on at least 39.7% of his three-point attempts in four of his last five seasons.This season, the 2023 NBA champion is averaging 18.2 points and 6.9 rebounds per game while shooting 50.6% from the field and 39.9% from three-point range. His ability to move without the ball and deliver a flawless release makes him an ideal fit for a Los Angeles Lakers team in need of reliable perimeter shooting.While Austin Reaves has been a versatile and valuable asset for the Lakers, Porter's elite shooting could provide the team with a significant upgrade. Reaves has been a key contributor, but his skill set may not be enough to address the Lakers' most pressing needs.However, acquiring Porter won't be easy. The Nuggets have consistently expressed their commitment to keeping him, especially after his crucial role in their championship run.making it unlikely they would part with him unless he experiences a decline in performance.Also read: NBA Offseason Rumors: Golden State Warriors eyeing $90 million Los Angeles Clippers star to push Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler's championship aspirations As the playoffs approach, the Los Angeles Lakers are expected to keep a close eye on Porter's situation.

PANAJI: Whenever Diego Godin closes his eyes and thinks of that magical night of May 17, 2014, at the Camp Nou, the former Atletico de Madrid defender remembers every scene almost perfectly.The frenzied start by hosts Barcelona , a lightning strike from Alexis Sanchez to put the home team ahead and the inspirational half-time talk from his team’s manager, Diego Simeone.It was the concluding clash of La Liga , and having lost the chance to wrap up the Spanish league title earlier, Atletico needed at least a point at the Camp Nou with Barca also chasing the title. Both Diego Costa and Arda Turan were taken off injured in the first 45 minutes. Then, as ends were changed, Godin powered a header from Koke’s corner to put Atletico level and eventually end the duopoly in Spanish football .It was their first league title in 18 years and the first time in ten years anyone outside Barcelona and Real Madrid had had a taste of it.“It wasn’t easy for us to win that championship at the Camp Nou,” Godin, now retired, said during a global media call arranged by La Liga on Saturday. “There were so many emotions, so much joy. If I have to handpick my best memory from my time at Atletico, the key moment was clearly that goal.”Since that 2014 triumph, Atletico have won La Liga just once, with Barcelona and Madrid taking turns to become champions. Now they have another chance as Barcelona visit the Wanda Metropolitano on Sunday. The Catalans are currently just one point ahead of the two Madrid clubs, with a game in hand.Defeat at Getafe last week put a massive dent in Atletico’s own title bid.“I wouldn’t say it’s a decisive clash but it’s an important one in the title race. If Atletico win, it will help the team a lot and lift their morale after their elimination from the Champions League (against rivals Real Madrid on penalties). Another defeat will be very hard to take,"" said Godin.“The (Champions League) defeat was very painful. It hurts more because Atletico were really enthusiastic and excited about going through (to the next stage). When you are eliminated from a competition where you’re so excited, you feel very empty (after a defeat).”Under Simeone, the former Uruguay captain and the country’s most capped footballer turned himself into a leader and the force around whom the team revolved. For nine years, he made close to 400 appearances, winning La Liga, two Europa Leagues, one Copa del Rey, one Spanish Super Cup and three UEFA Super Cups.Atletico also made it to the final of the Champions League twice, only to lose both times to bitter rivals Real Madrid.“When I joined, Atletico were a long way from Barcelona and Real Madrid but now it’s a team that can compete on equal terms. We’ve won leagues against them. We’ve got to the finals of Champions League, of Copa del Rey, the Super Cup.“So, you can imagine how the club has grown, and how the club continues to grow. It’s got better quality players, young players. The very equal competitiveness in sporting terms with Real and Barca is important. We cannot compete with them in terms of their finances, but in terms of sport, we can give them a fight,” said Godin.","Diego godin won the la liga title with atletico de madrid in may 2014.

NEW DELHI: Star Indian batter Virat Kohli dropped a major hint about his cricketing future on Saturday, admitting that he ""might not have another Australia tour in him."" Kohli made the candid revelation while speaking at the Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) Innovation Lab after arriving in Bengaluru ahead of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2025.Reflecting on his recent struggles on Australian soil, Kohli stated, ""I might not have another Australia tour in me, so I am at peace with whatever happened in the past."" The statement has sparked speculation among fans about whether the cricketing icon is considering stepping away from Test cricket in the near future.Despite the speculation, Kohli clarified that he is not mulling retirement at the moment, emphasising that he still loves playing the game. ""Don't get nervous. I'm not making any announcements. As of now, everything is fine. I still love playing the game,"" he reassured his fans. The prolific batter added that he no longer aspires to achieve milestones, instead focusing on playing for the ""pure joy"" of the sport.""It pretty much comes down to just the pure joy, enjoyment, competitive streak, and love for the game.

Figure out where you are placed in your life, and the answer is not that easy,"" he explained.The 36-year-old acknowledged that advancing age has made it tougher to maintain peak performance. ""Now, it takes much more effort as people who have played the game for a long period of time understand. You can't do so many things in your mid to late 30s that you can in your mid-20s. I'm at a bit of a different place in my life as well,"" Kohli admitted.Despite recent struggles, including a lackluster performance on the most recent Australia tour, Kohli has come to terms with his ups and downs. ""You have to make peace with whatever's happened in your life. Like in 2014 [against England], I still had the chance to go in 2018 and do what I did. It might not have been the case this time,"" he said.Kohli also touched on his mental approach to failure, emphasising the importance of blocking out external pressure. ""Once you start thinking of the disappointment from the outside, then you start burdening yourself way more. That’s something I've surely experienced in Australia as well,"" he noted.Beyond his own future, Kohli expressed his optimism about Indian cricket and the evolving landscape of women's sports, particularly the Women’s Premier League ( WPL ). He also looked forward to cricket being part of the 2028 Olympics, expressing hope for India to secure a medal.The RCB icon, who remains the highest run-scorer in IPL history with 8,004 runs in 252 matches, is set to join the RCB camp shortly as the team prepares for the new season under new captain Rajat Patidar.","Virat kohli admits he ""might not have another australia tour in him"" the 36-year-old batsman is currently in bengaluru ahead of the ipl.

Will Rohit Sharma win 2027 World Cup? Astrologer Lobo predicts after getting Champions Trophy bang on!

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Aakash Chopra believes that the 2025 Indian Premier League (IPL) could be a turning point for Rishabh Pant as he eyes a comeback to India's T20I squad . Pant, who has been out of the national T20 setup, now has a golden opportunity to prove his mettle while playing for the Lucknow Super Giants (LSG).Speaking on his YouTube channel, Chopra emphasised that Pant’s performances in the upcoming season could make or break his chances of returning to India’s T20I side. ""Rishabh Pant has a big opportunity. Why am I saying that? He is not part of the T20 team. He is not even part of their scheme of things. People are surprised as to why such a strong player is unable to get set in T20s. So, this is your season, sir. Come and score so many runs so that everyone is shaken,"" Chopra said.Pant, who has been an explosive and fearless batter for India in Tests and ODIs, has struggled to cement his spot in T20Is, where Sanju Samson has established himself as the first-choice wicketkeeper-batter. Chopra believes that Pant must carefully choose his batting position to maximise his impact.""Where he would bat would be a question. There are a lot of discussions that he would open as keepers are batting there. You don't have to compete with Sanju. You have to make your own place properly. I would say there is no need to bat above No. 3 or No. 4. If you get a great start, come at No. 3, or else keep all three left-handers at four, five and six, and hit everyone,"" Chopra advised.Chopra further noted that the current Indian T20I team might undergo significant changes before next year’s T20 World Cup , hinting at the dynamic nature of the squad. ""There are two things. Firstly, take the team forward. Then you get recognised more as a captain. Secondly, if you score runs, you return to India reckoning. I am still not convinced that the T20 team playing currently will play next year as well. The T20 selections are going to be very dynamic,"" Chopra remarked.As captain of LSG, Pant also carries the responsibility of leading a new franchise, which adds to his challenge of making a statement with both the bat and his leadership. Chopra concluded, ""So this IPL will play a huge role in terms of who is moving forward and able to make his place again. So I see a huge opportunity for Rishabh Pant as a captain with a new franchise and as a batter.""With the T20 World Cup on the horizon and intense competition for spots, all eyes will be on Rishabh Pant to see if he can rise to the occasion and make a strong case for his return to India’s T20I squad.","Former india cricketer aakash chopra believes that the 2025 indian premier league (ipl) could be a turning point for rishabh pant as he eyes a comeback to india's t20i squad.

Champions Return: Rohit, Hardik, Shreyas, Gambhir return after India's title triumph

NEW DELHI: Jasprit Bumrah and Sanjana Ganesan celebrated their fourth wedding anniversary on Friday, March 15, 2025, with a heartfelt exchange of love. Marking the special day, Sanjana shared a touching message featuring song lyrics that encapsulated her deep bond with the Indian pace spearhead .Sanjana marked her fourth wedding anniversary with Jasprit Bumrah by sharing heartfelt lyrics from the song ""Tu Hai Toh"" on Instagram.""Tu hai toh dil dhadakta hai/Tu na toh ghar ghar nahi lagta/Tu hai to darr nahi lagta/Happy 4,"" wrote Bumrah's wife.The couple, who tied the knot in an intimate ceremony in Goa in 2021, welcomed their son, Angad, on September 4, 2023.While the celebration was all about love and togetherness, Bumrah’s absence from the field has been a topic of discussion.The Mumbai Indians pacer has been recovering from a lower back injury sustained during the fifth Test against Australia in January. The injury sidelined him from bowling in the second innings of the Sydney Test, which India lost by six wickets.As a result, Bumrah also missed India’s victorious Champions Trophy campaign, where the Men in Blue lifted the title without their premier fast bowler.His absence was a major blow, but the team management opted to give him ample time to recover, with an eye on the upcoming Test series against England in June.""His recuperation is going well. But at this stage, it’s better to give him more time to return to peak fitness,"" a source told PTI.The BCCI medical team has not provided a definitive timeline for his return, but he has been gradually increasing his workload in the nets. Chief selector Ajit Agarkar had earlier advised five weeks of ""off-loading"" to manage stress on his back, considering his history of similar injuries.With IPL 2025 around the corner, Mumbai Indians will be hoping for Bumrah’s return, especially after their disappointing tenth-place finish last season. However, his availability for the initial games remains uncertain.","Jasprit bumrah and sanjana ganesan celebrated their fourth wedding anniversary on march 15, 2025.

Dwyane Wade Reveals Cancer Diagnosis Led to Kidney Surgery | E! News

The toughest challenge yet—Physically and Emotionally



Dwyane Wade- A legacy that extends beyond Basketball

Basketball icon Dwyane Wade has never shied away from tough battles, but his latest opponent was one he never saw coming. The three-time NBA champion, known for his explosive plays and leadership on the court, recently revealed a personal health scare that left fans stunned. At just 41 years old, Wade was diagnosed with cancer, leading to a life-altering surgery that removed nearly half of his kidney.Since retiring from the NBA in 2019, Dwyane Wade has built a thriving post-basketball career, becoming a co-owner of the Utah Jazz and the WNBA’s Chicago Sky while also making strides in television and podcasting. But despite his busy schedule, the former Miami Heat superstar knew something was off when he started experiencing unusual symptoms like abdominal discomfort and weak urine flow.Initially, Wade didn’t think much of it. However, given his father’s recent health struggles, he decided to get a full-body scan, a choice that would ultimately save his life. During a candid episode of his podcast, The Why with Dwyane Wade, he shared the moment doctors discovered a tumor in his right kidney, an outcome he never expected.“I didn’t go in for my kidneys, but because I did the full-body scan, they saw something,” Wade explained. The shocking revelation led to a crucial decision in December 2023, when surgery became the only option to determine whether the tumor was malignant. (via: Daily Express U.S.)For an athlete who built a career on resilience, Wade’s battle with cancer was a test of an entirely different kind. The surgery took a significant toll, not just physically, but emotionally.“I think it was the first time my family, my dad, my kids, they saw me weak,” Wade shared. “That moment was probably the weakest I’ve ever felt in my life. One thing you never want to do as a man? You never want your family to see you weak. ”As a father of five and husband to actress Gabrielle Union , Wade’s health scare was a stark reminder of how unpredictable life can be. It also underscored the importance of regular health screenings, a message he hopes to pass on to others.Also Read: JJ Redick takes the blame after Dalton Knecht’s scary fall complicates Lakers' vs. Nuggets Wade’s impact on the game is undeniable—three NBA titles, a Finals MVP, and 13 All-Star appearances but his story extends far beyond basketball. His willingness to speak openly about his health battle adds another layer to his legacy, inspiring fans to prioritize their well-being, break the stigma around personal struggles, and embrace resilience in the face of adversity.As he continues his post-NBA journey, Wade remains a symbol of strength, perseverance, and advocacy. Whether mentoring young athletes, championing important causes, or sharing his personal challenges, he proves that even legends face battles.

NEW DELHI: With eight days to the start of IPL 2025 , the lineup for captains in the tournament was completed when Delhi Capitals announced star all-rounder and the men’s team’s longest-serving player Axar Patel as captain.Axar, 31, who had initially joined the Capitals in 2019, has played 82 matches across six seasons for the franchise where he took 62 wickets and scored 967 runs.Axar is a veteran of 150 IPL matches in which he scored 1653 runs and picked 123 wickets, including a hat-trick in 2016 when he took four wickets in five balls for Punjab.Pant, who had been DC's long-term captain, moved to Lucknow Super Giants after the Delhi franchise opted against retaining him. LSG acquired his services for Rs 27 crore during the auction and have gone on to appoint him as captain.Before Axar, Kolkata Knight Riders had named veteran Ajinkya Rahane as captain in what came as a surprise move considering the defending champions had splashed big on Venkatesh Iyer.One of the biggest appointments going into the IPL 2025 season is that of Rajat Patidar to try and lead Royal Challengers Bengaluru to their first IPL title. Patidar was one of the two contenders for the leadership role with ex-skipper Virat Kohli the other option. The franchise, however, went for the long-term vision by appointing the 31-year-old.Patidar, known for his solid batting, now shoulders the responsibility of leading RCB in their pursuit of IPL title. His appointment continues the rich legacy of leadership at the franchise, following in the footsteps of legends such as Rahul Dravid, Kevin Pietersen, Anil Kumble, Daniel Vettori, Virat Kohli, and Faf du Plessis.(TBA - To be announced)",Ipl 2025 captains announced with eight days to go for start of tournament.

On the WPL and growth of the women’s game:

BENGALURU: Virat Kohli on Saturday made it clear that retirement is not on the immediate agenda but the star batter admitted he may not be around when India tour Australia next in four years’ time. In a tongue-in-cheek response to the possibility of coming out of retirement for the 2028 Olympics, the 36-year-old former India skipper, speaking at the RCB Innovation Lab’s Leadership Summit here on Saturday, quipped, “I just might sneak in for one game, if we are playing the gold-medal match!”Excerpts...I’m not playing for achievement. It pretty much comes down to just the pure joy, enjoyment and love for the game. And as long as that is intact, I’ll continue to play the game. I have to be honest about that with myself, because the competitive streak doesn’t allow you to find the answer. I had a very interesting conversation about this with Rahul Dravid when he was coach. He said you always have to stay in touch with yourself, figure out where you are placed in your life. And the answer is not that easy, because you might be going through a lean phase, and you (may) feel like this is it, but it might not be. When it is time, he said my competitive streak would not allow me to accept it. Maybe one more. You just have to pray and hope for clarity when it comes.The only thing that we as a team have tried to do is create an environment of fun and involvement. When you go to a practice session, you’re looking forward to being at the training ground with your friends. It doesn’t feel like a drag, it doesn’t feel like I have to get off the bus and go for another session. It’s like, when are we going to get together with the boys again? Because we have so much talent today. And I think it came out beautifully. The guys adapted well to what was in front of them. We ended up winning because we adapted to the conditions much better than the others.I’m happy about the inclusion. The amount of cricket has increased, so have the number of teams. Leagues are being played all over the world. The IPL has played a massive role in that as well. It’s a great opportunity for our guys. To be Olympic champions would be a magnificent feeling.I can’t pinpoint one lowest point. If you ask me the intensity of how disappointed I’ve been, for me the most recent Australia tour would be the one that’s most fresh, or for a long period of time the tour of England in 2014 was the thing that bothered me the most. But I can’t look at it that way. I might not have an Australia tour again in me in four years’ time. I don’t have the chance to correct it. So, you have to make peace with whatever’s happened in your life. How do I cope? It’s just about the acceptance.There was a time when I realized that I need to change the way I'm preparing as an athlete. Motivation was something that came from within. No one had to force me to do it. India had a couple of very difficult overseas tours. And I figured out that the reason that we were falling short is because the other team was physically way fitter than us. And they were able to hold their plans and skills in pressure situations for way longer periods than we could. And that’s what Test cricket is all about, who’s able to stay in the battle for longer periods of time.After I became captain, we started to bring in this kind of culture into the team as well. It eventually became a fabric that went into the culture of the Indian cricket.The perception (about women’s cricket) has changed massively. I think what the Indian women's cricket team has done over the last few years is that they are the ones who were the catalyst to kind of put the attention onto themselves. I literally saw it happening in a time span of 6-7 years. The way they started playing, you could see that belief and then people started engaging a lot more. And eventually it got to a place where commercials became better. Money was being infused into the women's game. And then you have the WPL. We have all seen the number of people that come and watch the games. And the standard of the games as well, be it power-hitting or skill levels and everything. This is what happens when you take a sport or even a part of a sport to that level of competition and equality.","Virat kohli says he may not be around when india tour australia next in four years' time.

'Not going anywhere': Rohit Sharma on retirement from ODIs after winning the Champions Trophy

Pakistan cricket has experienced significant turmoil in recent years with frequent changes in leadership, management, coaches, and selectors showing no improvement. These constant changes have negatively impacted many careers, including that of Babar Azam , one of Pakistan's most talented cricketers.Babar's performance has declined significantly, and he has been removed from captaincy positions twice. His recent performance in the Champions Trophy drew criticism from various former cricket players.Former Pakistani spinner Saeed Ajmal has defended Babar Azam against criticism from former cricketers.""Aapke paas ek hi toh star hai. If you degrade him also, then how will your cricket run? These are the big issues. Our former cricketers should keep their mouths shut,"" told Sportstar.""As a cricketer, one must realise that bad patches are part of a player's career. You can't play cricket the same way all your life. Even if you were Sachin Tendulkar, you couldn't score 100 runs in every match.""Following Pakistan's poor performance in the Champions Trophy, the board made immediate changes. Mohammad Rizwan was removed as T20I captain, and both he and Babar Azam were dropped from the team.""Look, the way you've removed them is wrong. It's not like they are the only ones who haven't scored while others have. That's not the case. Ideally, the selectors should sit down with Babar and discuss rest so that he can come back stronger.""""Babar and Rizwan are great players. Their stats are as good as anyone's, but the only difference is that they don't bat aggressively, but they still score runs. Our guys have suddenly realised that in international cricket, everyone plays aggressively.""""Come on, what aggression are we talking about? If they are your proven match-winners, you don't need aggression. Even legends like Virat often pace their innings slowly before attacking, that's his style.""","Babar azam has been removed from captaincy positions twice.
