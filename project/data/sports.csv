Taylor Swift Has “Distanced” Herself From Blake Lively Because Of This Reason, Fans Say



Blake Lively Was Not Spotted With Taylor Swift At Super Bowl 2025



Taylor Swift, the billionaire pop star, has been in the news since she got booed at the Super Bowl last weekend when Travis Kelce’s team, the Kansas City Chiefs lost the trophy to the Philadelphia Eagles. Away from the Super Bowl drama, the pop star has also found herself involved in the legal drama between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni. But now, the reason why Taylor Swift has “distanced” herself from Blake Lively is pretty clear, according to fans.Taylor Swift has remained pretty silent about the whole controversial situation and is yet to make an official announcement about it. It seems like fans have found the reason behind it.A fan took to X and wrote, “The fact that Taylor Swift, huge advocate of the womens movement, didnt support bestie Blake Lively speaks volumes. If anyone would support, know and have proof that Blake was harrassed it would be Taylor Swift. Talks, calls, texts...Yet Taylor didn't support it. Hmmm”Another fan wrote, “If my bestfriend who made me godmother to her children was in a legal battle over sexual harassment & retaliation, I would be standing ten toes down with her. I would not abandon her. The fact that Taylor Swift distanced herself from Blake Lively is damning enough.”While it is not confirmed why Taylor Swift has not been spotted recently with her best friend, Blake Lively, fans are pretty convinced that this is the reason behind it.For the unversed, Blake Lively had accused Justin Baldoni of harassment and Justin filed a counter lawsuit against Blake Lively and her husband Ryan Reynolds accusing them of defamation and trying to take over control of their blockbuster movie, It Ends With Us. Taylor Swift was named by Justin Baldoni in the lawsuit as he felt Blake Lively tried to “use” Taylor Swift’s power and influence to gain control of the movie.Many fans also expected to see Taylor Swift and Blake Lively at the Super Bowl held last weekend but Blake was nowhere to be found at the stadium. This was in complete contrast to the 2024 Super Bowl when Blake Lively was spotted cheering on Travis Kelce as she stood next to Taylor Swift. The two were also spotted hugging each other when the Kansas City Chiefs won the trophy last year.A few days ago, a source revealed to Page Six that “Taylor really wishes Blake hadn’t dragged her into this whole situation.” This might be true considering how Taylor Swift has avoided being spotted with Blake Lively.With the Chiefs losing the Super Bowl, both Travis Kelce and Taylor Swift have been trolled but have remained silent.Also Read: Hailee Steinfeld reacts as Josh Allen gets asked out on a date during their appearance at NFL Honors","Taylor swift has been in the news since she got booed at the super bowl last weekend when travis kelce’s team, the kansas city chiefs lost the trophy to the philadelphia eagles.

Shannon Sharpe advises Travis Kelce about his future

Chiefs give Travis Kelce DEADLINE to decide NFL future | Nightcap

After the Eagles' 40-22 victory against the Chiefs, Philadelphia experienced a tragic event where a man shot two women. Fortunately, both were stable and the suspect was arrested. Meanwhile, the Chiefs faced doubts for the next season due to their poor performance in the Super Bowl, particularly for their future quarterback, Travis Kelce. Kelce, at 35, has had his worst season in yards and touchdowns since his rookie year.Travis Kelce, the longest-tenured player on the Chiefs roster, has been a cornerstone since being drafted 63rd overall in 2013. He has appeared in 175 games and is considered one of the greatest tight ends in NFL history. However, his age is starting to catch up, and this season he appeared slower and lacked his usual explosiveness. With one year left on his contract, the Chiefs must decide if keeping him is worth the financial investment.NFL Hall of Famer Shannon Sharpe advises Kelce to take control of his future and not let the organization dictate his next move, referencing legendary players like Tom Brady, Peyton Manning, and Jerry Rice who changed teams late in their careers.""Tom Brady won six Super Bowls and ended up in Tampa. Peyton Manning had four MVPs, two Super Bowl appearances, one Super Bowl MVP and finished in Denver. Jerry Rice...I don't have to go anymore,"" Sharpe said on his podcast with Ochocinco. ""Understand the business and how it works. Do what is in your best interest.”Shannon Sharpe's comparisons are valid, but Kelce's situation is unique. Unlike Brady and Manning, Kelce's last game was a Super Bowl loss, making it difficult for him to process his last game in a successful career. He wants to return to the most important game, making it difficult for him to process.Kelce, despite declining production, holds the NFL record for most receptions and playoff receiving touchdowns by a receiver. He currently ranks 14th on the all-time receptions list with 1,004 career catches. If he returns for one more season, he has a good chance of joining Marvin Harrison and Larry Fitzgerald as the only players in this elite group to spend their entire careers with one team.Also Read: “An upward trajectory”: Birmingham fans express their opinions on minority owner of Birmingham City club Tom Brady With free agency approaching on March 12, Kelce must now evaluate his options and seek advice from his closest friends, including Taylor Swift. Chiefs head coach Andy Reid believes Kelce has the potential to be a great coach, but it seems more likely that he will pursue entertainment opportunities. With past hosting gigs and an upcoming role in Happy Gilmore 2, Kelce's post-NFL future could be as high-profile as his playing career.","Travis kelce, 35, has had his worst season in yards and touchdowns since his rookie year.

“The Mavericks, though, sit less than $200,000 away from the NBA's first luxury-tax apron … even after Davis waived his trade kicker upon learning that the Lakers were dealing him to Dallas for Doncic.”

According to NBA insider Marc Stein, the Mavericks recently tried to sign formerbefore he joined the Los Angeles Clippers.Stein reported on The Stein Line that Dallas showed interest in Simmons during the buyout market.Stein wrote.Ben Simmons, a three-time All-Star, could have provided the Mavericks with much-needed playmaking and defensive versatility. While he hasn’t been the same dominant force since his Philadelphia 76ers days, his ability to facilitate and guard multiple positions would have been valuable for Dallas.However, financial constraints played a role in the Dallas Mavericks ’ inability to secure Simmons. Stein noted,Despite missing out on Ben Simmons, the Mavericks’ interest signals their intent to remain active in the buyout market. With the trade deadline behind them, Dallas is likely to explore additional options to bolster their roster for a playoff push. The team’s success will depend on who becomes available and how quickly they can integrate new pieces.Simmons’ move to the Clippers also sets up a potential postseason showdown between the two teams. If Dallas can stay healthy and add the right pieces, they could make a deep playoff run and possibly return to the NBA Finals.For now, the Dallas Mavericks’ pursuit of Ben Simmons highlights their determination to build a contender around Anthony Davis and Kyrie Irving .

Both Swift and Kelce are expected to make a statement at the event.“As part of their R&R time, it's thought the couple could finally make an official red carpet appearance together — with the Met Gala earmarked as their first potential event together,” the Mirror reported of Kelce and Swift. “So far Swift and Kelce, who began dating in 2023, have struggled to align their schedules to step out together at an event.”Swift and her boyfriend Kelce have decided to attend the Met Gala, a first for Swift, as she hasn't attended the event with any of her boyfriends since 2016. This follows their 2023 invitation to the Oscars, where they also declined. “… However the Met Gala isn't until May, and with Swift not planning to tour this year it's thought she and Kelce could turn out at the red carpet event together.

The ‘Young and Drunk’ Version Of Tom Brady Which Vince Wilfork Saw At The Derby

For most NFL fans, Tom Brady ’s let-his-hair-down moment and the ensuing drunken trophy toss at the Buccaneers’ Super Bowl parade was a rare glimpse of him letting loose. But his teammates have often talked about how Brady loves partying. Former Patriots DT Vince Wilfork has recently revealed that Brady’s 2021 trophy toss wasn’t the only time the team got a look at Brady’s fun side.In the latest episode of Green Light with Chris Long, Wilfork revealed that he saw an adventurous side of Tom Brady at the 2014 Kentucky Derby . Wilfork said that during his and Brady’s attendance at the Derby, the latter got quite drunk and lost some of his inhibition.“Yes, I did see him drunk, but it was early on in my career. Tom was always private, like Tom only used to hang around certain people and stuff, but I think I’ve seen him drunk because we had gone to Derby. There I got a chance to see the different side of him,” Wilfork recalled.Tom Brady is a big Kentucky Derby fan and visited Churchill Downs where his Pork Pie hat would make headlines the next day. Wilfork also pointed out how Brady was different than most quarterbacks especially when it comes to dealing with people.Also Read: THROWBACK: When the FBI Helped Find $500K Worth Super Bowl Jersey of NFL Legend Tom Brady “Tom never acted like one of those bougie quarterbacks. He is a great team player,” Wilfork broke down. “I would see rookies coming in and they would have a jersey and Tom would sit there and sign. He would tell nobody no, he never cared who you are, he doesn’t care how long you’ve been in the league—he would sit and sign for you.”Wilfork also called the seven-time Super Bowl winner one of the best teammates he’s ever had the chance to play with. Many kudos go to him because you know QBs have a stigmatism to where they are known to be a-holes. But Tom probably is one of the greatest teammates I’ve had.”","Vince wilfork revealed that he saw tom brady drunk at the kentucky derby.

The event has been the first best-on-best tournament in a long time.Alex Ovechkin is not participating in the 4 Nations Face-Off tournament, leaving Russians' status for the upcoming Olympics in doubt. Russia could have formed a dynamic roster with players like Ovechkin, Kucherov, Malkin, Kaprizov, and Panarin, and goalkeepers Shesterkin or Vasilevsky. Evgeni Malkin expressed interest in the 4 Nations Face-Off, which was relayed to Ovechkin, who was asked about his attention to the tournament by Match TV.Alex Ovechkin referenced this in his latest comments about the tournament, indicating that he simply does not care because his countrymen are not there. ""I won't be watching the Four Nations Tournament. What's the point of watching something where the Russian team isn't participating?”Ovechkin, who would likely lead the Russian team in scoring, would not be watching the Four Nations faceoff on TV. Instead, he has taken advantage of his vacation in Miami, where he is currently on vacation. Despite this, he is still taking care of himself, posting about training with one of his former teammates.Alex Ovechkin is close to surpassing Wayne Gretzky with 879 career goals, just 15 behind the NHL's all-time leading goal scorer. Ovechkin's rapid scoring pace this season has helped close the gap. To surpass Gretzky, Ovechkin needs 16 goals in 27 games and a 0.593 goals-per-game pace, with a goal-per-game rate of 0.593.Also Read: Charlie McAvoy threw a textbook hit to Connor McDavid, sending the world's best hockey player down to the ice Hopefully, the next time we get a major best-on-best tournament where Russians and other Europeans can participate, while focusing on the NHL's success thus far, as it has not disappointed them thus far.","Alex ovechkin is not participating in the 4 nations face-off tournament, leaving russians' status for the upcoming olympics in doubt.

Chinese F1 Team Next? FIA President Eyes Expansion After Cadillac Joins the Grid



The landscape of Formula 1 is undergoing a significant transformation, with FIA President Mohammed Ben Sulayem now advocating for the inclusion of a twelfth team, ideally from China. His remarks come shortly after General Motors' Cadillac secured a spot on the 2026 grid as the sport’s eleventh team, marking a pivotal moment in F1’s expansion.The journey to Cadillac’s entry into Formula 1 was anything but smooth. Despite initially passing FIA's stringent evaluation under the Andretti Cadillac name, the bid was rejected by Formula One Management (FOM) on commercial grounds. Many team principals opposed the expansion beyond ten teams, citing concerns over revenue distribution and logistical complications. However, a strategic shift—where General Motors took a more direct role—helped Cadillac finally gain acceptance.This move positioned Cadillac as the second American team in Formula 1, joining Haas. The decision also reinforced Ben Sulayem’s long-term vision of attracting major manufacturers from influential automotive markets, further diversifying the sport.Following Cadillac’s approval, Ben Sulayem has now turned his focus toward securing a Chinese manufacturer for Formula 1. China already boasts its first F1 driver, Zhou Guanyu, and bringing a national manufacturer into the mix would elevate the country’s presence in the sport. Speaking to Le Figaro, the FIA president emphasized his belief that expanding the grid with new teams rather than increasing the number of races would be beneficial.""20 races was enough, and from the outset, I've thought that we need fewer grands prix, but more teams. That's why we brought in General Motors with Cadillac,"" Ben Sulayem stated.While acknowledging skepticism from within the sport, he maintained that expansion strengthens Formula 1’s global appeal. ""A lot of people were against it, but I think it's a good decision for the sport.""When asked about adding a twelfth team, he reaffirmed his desire for a quality entrant rather than simply increasing numbers. ""Should we think in terms of quantity or quality? We need quality stables,"" he said.""It's been my dream for the last two years that the big countries should have a presence in Formula 1.""The United States will be with General Motors. The next step is to welcome a Chinese manufacturer. We already have a driver [in Ferrari reserve and ex-Stake driver, Zhou Guanyu].""With Cadillac confirmed for 2026, the next few years could see increased discussions around expanding the grid further. However, any new team would face regulatory and commercial hurdles similar to those Cadillac encountered. If a Chinese manufacturer does join, it would mark a historic step in Formula 1’s globalization strategy.Also Read: ""Anyone who doubts him is silly"": Lando Norris slams critics of Lewis Hamilton ahead of Ferrari F1 debut For now, all eyes remain on how Cadillac integrates into the sport and whether Ben Sulayem’s vision of a more inclusive, manufacturer-driven F1 grid will come to fruition.","Fia president mohammed ben sulayem calls for a twelfth team, ideally from china.

Liam Lawson Expects a Challenging Red Bull F1 Debut



Liam Lawson on the 2025 F1 Season, Advice For Rookies, & George Russell's Escape Room Skills

Liam Lawson is set to make his highly anticipated full-season debut in Formula 1, stepping into a Red Bull seat alongside Max Verstappen . However, the young Kiwi is under no illusions about the challenges ahead. With only 11 grand prix starts under his belt, all of which came in the latter half of 2023 and 2024, Lawson acknowledges that adapting to the demands of a full F1 calendar will be a daunting task.Liam Lawson was officially named as Sergio Perez’s replacement in December, following a disappointing season for the Mexican driver. Despite Red Bull’s dominant performance last year, the 22-year-old driver is not expecting immediate success, particularly given his lack of experience on several circuits that feature early in the 2025 calendar.The upcoming season will introduce Lawson to a host of unfamiliar tracks, adding an extra layer of difficulty to his transition into one of F1’s most competitive seats. “Going into a year like this, especially the start of the season, I’m going to a lot of tracks I haven’t done before,” he admitted. “I think the start of the year is going to be the hardest as well. Going to a bunch of tracks I haven’t done before starting the season, it’s going to be very, very tough.”While the Red Bull RB21 is expected to be a front-running car, Lawson is not setting unrealistic expectations for himself. His early-season schedule includes challenging circuits like Melbourne, Shanghai, Miami, and Montreal—places he has either never raced on or only experienced in junior categories. Nonetheless, he remains eager to embrace the challenge, stating, “I’m very excited for Melbourne and I’m very excited for the start of the year.”Despite the uphill battle, Lawson is looking forward to proving himself at the highest level. “There’s a lot of cool tracks that I haven’t done that I think I will enjoy, like Melbourne. China looks like a cool track, Canada is somewhere I’ve always wanted to drive.”Also Read: ""Anyone who doubts him is silly"": Lando Norris slams critics of Lewis Hamilton ahead of Ferrari F1 debut With a new team, heightened expectations, and an uncharted season ahead, Lawson is prepared for what could be his toughest yet most rewarding year in Formula 1.",Liam lawson is set to make his full-season debut for red bull in 2025.
