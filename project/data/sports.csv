T20 World Cup | 'Our flight is booked and we are going' - Suryakumar Yadav on Pakistan's boycott

The impasse over the India-Pakistan T20 WC match showed no signs of being resolved, after Pakistan PM Shehbaz Sharif weighed in on the issue, calling their boycott of the February 15 match against India in Colombo an “appropriate decision”. It was a “considered stance” to support Bangladesh, he said.“We have taken a very clear stand on the T20 World Cup that we won’t play the match against India because there should be no politics on the sports field. We have taken a very considered stance, and we should completely stand by Bangladesh, and I think this is a very appropriate decision. We are with Bangladesh,” the PM said.Meanwhile, Bangladesh Youth and Sports Advisor Asif Nazrul acknowledged Sharif’s decision. “Thank you, Pakistan,” Nazrul wrote in a social media post.As the start of this contentious World Cup nears, speaking at a pre-tournament captain’s press conferences from two different locations – Mumbai’s BCCI headquarters and from Colombo — both teams’ captains broke their silence on the issue.“We haven’t refused to play against Pakistan. They have refused. The mindset is pretty clear. We have not said no, it has come from them,” India skipper Suryakumar Yadav said.“The ICC has given a fixture, BCCI and the (Indian) govt has decided with the ICC on playing at a neutral venue. Our flight is booked for Colombo and we are going,” he added.Salman Ali Agha, his Pakistani opposite number, said, “The India game is not in our control. It’s the govt’s and PCB’s decision and we respect that. Whatever they are going to say, we will do that.”“If we have to play them again in the semifinal or final, we will have to go back to them (govt) and act on their advice,” added the Pakistan skipper. The Indian captain acknowledged that the situation is “not easy” for those involved in the issue, including the ICC.“I feel it is not an easy job. It is not my call. I am sure they (the ICC) might be working out something as well but it has come from the other govt or the nation, how can they (the ICC) help as well? Their (Pakistan’s) decision is not in my control. I wish I could take their decisions, but then it is their call,” said Suryakumar.“We have been told that we have to play a game in Colombo on Feb 15th. We played them three times in the Asia Cup, we played some good cricket. We won (all the matches) and we were very happy. Similarly, if we get an opportunity in Colombo, we will definitely play,” he added.Earlier, Inter national Cricket Council (ICC) had expressed serious concerns over the Pakistan govt’s decision.“This position of selective participation is difficult to reconcile with the fundamental premise of a global sporting event where all qualified teams are expected to compete on equal terms per the event schedule,” it had said. “This decision is not in the interest of the global game or the welfare of fans worldwide.”",Pakistan pm shehbaz sharif calls their boycott of the february 15 match against india in colombo an “appropriate decision” bangladesh youth and sports advisor asif nazrul acknowledged sharif’s decision.

CHANDIGARH: Senior AAP leader Anurag Dhanda on Saturday accused the BJP government in Haryana of stopping about 37,000 players' diet allowance in the state for the past 10 months.He further slammed the ruling party for allegedly citing ""absurd"" reasons to refuse pension payments to over 75,000 elderly people in Haryana.Speaking to mediapersons here, AAP's national media in-charge Dhanda said Haryana has always been the land of sports, and most of the players who have raised the country's tricolour high in the Olympics, Commonwealth and Asian Games have come from this soil.""But today, those same players are asking whether the value of their hard work and medals is limited only to garnering applause on election platforms,"" Dhanda said.He attacked Haryana chief minister Nayab Singh Saini and said the players shed their blood and sweat on the field all day, and their parents, who earn their livelihood through hard work, work to help them win medals.Dhanda alleged that the state government had not paid the diet allowance of 37,000 players who practise in sports nurseries in the state for the past 10 months.The purpose of the sports nurseries was to enable grassroots players to get good training and nutrition so they could compete at the national and international levels, he said.He further claimed that the coaches training these players have not received their salaries either for 10 months.""Should the players focus on arranging their meals or preparing for their sport?"" the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) leader questioned.Dhanda alleged that the state government was closing the nurseries for two months every year. ""Does any athlete prepare for international medals by taking a two-month break?"" he asked.On the alleged suspension of pension payments to over 75,000 elderly people, he said, ""If a farmer receives Rs 1.50 or Rs 2 lakh in their account for their crop, they are being told that they have an income of Rs 3 lakh and therefore, they cannot receive pension. This means the Nayab government considers a farmer who sells crops worth Rs 3 lakh to be wealthy,"" he claimed.In some cases, pensions are being stopped by citing the total family income in the Parivar Pehchan Patra (family ID) and in some cases, due to mismatches in name, surname or age, he claimed.At many places, the entire family's income is being considered, even though the elderly person's income has no connection to the family's income, he added.Hundreds of elderly people and women are queuing up at government offices across Haryana, asking why their pensions have been cut, the AAP leader said.","Senior aap leader anurag dhanda accused the bjp government in haryana of stopping about 37,000 players' diet allowance in the state for the past 10 months.

The list of men’s contracts for 2025-26

List of Women players for 2025-26 contracts

MUMBAI: India's premier pacer Jasprit Bumrah, ODI and Test skipper Shubman Gill and veteran allrounder Ravindra Jadeja are the only three players who will be given Grade A central contracts for 2025-26 by the BCCI , while former captains Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma , who play only the ODI format now, have been kept in the 'B' category, TOI has exclusively learnt. Kohli and Rohit are both modern-day legends and were in the A+ category earlier, but have been moved to the B category as they now play only one out of three formats.Overall, 30 Indian players will be given the BCCI central contracts for the 2025-26 season, as per the recommendations of the national selectors. The Board is expected to officially announce the list of contracted players soon.Bumrah, India's premier pacer across formats and team's strike bowler, was in the A+ category, and so was Jadeja. For Gill, being retained in the A category of central contracts is a major source of relief after being dropped from India's T20 squad just ahead of the 2026 T20 World Cup at home. Like Kohli and Rohit, Jadeja has retired from T20Is, but he still features in Tests and ODIs, where he has been in poor form of late.TOI had reported in its Jan 21 edition that BCCI was set to make a major overhaul in its Annual Central Contracts system, with sweeping changes that could significantly reshape the hierarchy of Indian cricket’s elite players, for the 2025-26 season.The Ajit Agarkar-led national selection committee had proposed doing away with the prestigious Grade A+ category, which was introduced back in 2018 altogether, a move that directly impacted senior stalwarts Kohli and Rohit.Who will be given Grade ‘B’ central contracts by the BCCI. The others in this category are: Off-spinning allrounder Washington Sundar, Test opener and ODI 'keeper-batter KL Rahul, senior pacer Mohammed Siraj, white-ball allrounder Hardik Pandya , India's Test vice-captain Rishabh Pant, Chinaman bowler Kuldeep Yadav, India's Test and ODI opener Yashasvi Jaiswal, India's T20 captain Suryakumar Yadav, and ODI middle-order batter Shreyas Iyer.Grade C contracts will be given to 16 players-Axar Patel, Tilak Varma, Rinku Singh, Shivam Dube, Sanju Samson, Arshdeep Singh, Prasidh Krishna, Akash Deep, Dhruv Jurel, Harshit Rana, Varun Chakravarthy, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Abhishek Sharma, Sai Sudarshan, Ravi Bishnoi and Ruturaj Gaikwad.Meanwhile, in the case of the Indian women’s team, the biggest gainer in the case of annual retainership for 2025-26 is India’s 2025 World Cup semifinal hero Jemimah Rodrigues, who has been promoted to the A category, where she joins skipper Harmanpreet Kaur, vice-captain Smriti Mandhana and ace allrounder Deepti Sharma.Rodrigues, who captained Delhi Capitals to the final in the recently-concluded Women’s Premier League, had slammed brilliant 127 not out off 134 balls to fashion a stunning five-wicket win over Australia in the semifinal of the 2025 Women’s ODI World Cup in Oct-Nov last year at the DY Patil Stadium in Navi Mumbai.Before that game, the Mumbai batter had smashed 76 not out off 55 balls against New Zealand to contribute to India’s win in a do-or-die game for them at the same venue.Grade A: Jasprit Bumrah, Shubman Gill and Ravindra Jadeja.Grade B: Washington Sundar, Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, KL Rahul, Mohammed Siraj, Hardik Pandya, Rishabh Pant, Kuldeep Yadav, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Suryakumar Yadav, Shreyas Iyer.Grade C: Axar Patel, Tilak Varma, Rinku Singh, Shivam Dube, Sanju Samson, Arshdeep Singh, Prasidh Krishna, Akash Deep, Dhruv Jurel, Harshit Rana, Varun Chakravarthy, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Abhishek Sharma, Sai Sudarshan, Ravi Bishnoi, Ruturaj Gaikwad.Grade A: Harmanpreet Kaur, Smriti Mandhana, Jemimah Rodrigues, Deepti Sharma.Grade B: Renuka Thakur, Shafali Verma, Richa Ghosh, Sneh Rana.Grade C: Radha Yadav, Amanjot Kaur, Pratika Rawal, Kranti Gaud, Uma Chhetri (wk), Arundhati Reddy, Shree Charini, Yastika Bhatia, Harleen Deol, Kashvi Gautam, G Kamlini (wk), Vaishnavi Sharma, Tejal Hasbnis.","India's premier pacer jasprit bumrah, odi and test skipper shubman gill and veteran allrounder ravindra jadeja are the only three players who will be given grade a central contracts for 2025-26.

How Terrance Gore’s speed helped the Kansas City Royals win big moments

Terrance Gore, the Kansas City Royals player known for game-changing speed, has died at the age of 34. The team confirmed the news on Friday, February 6. His wife, Britney Gore, shared on social media that he died after problems during what was meant to be a routine surgery. Gore leaves behind his wife and their three children. While many players are remembered for home runs or big hits, Gore built his career in a very different way. He made his mark with speed alone. When he reached base, fans stood up because something exciting was about to happen.Even before he recorded his first major league hit, he was helping teams win games in big moments. Terrance Gore spent parts of eight seasons in Major League Baseball. The Kansas City Royals team became his most recognized team when his leg power helped him win tight matches, which ultimately led to the team's victory in the 2015 World Series. Teammates respected him, fans loved him, and wherever he played, his energy stood out. His impact went far beyond the stat sheet.Terrance Gore stood 5 feet 7 inches tall and weighed around 160 pounds, but his speed made him larger than life. He once ran the 40-yard dash in 4.29 seconds.The Royals used him mainly as a pinch runner, especially during their deep playoff runs in 2014 and 2015.Gore began his career by stealing 17 bases without being caught. Pitchers rushed. Catchers panicked. Fans held their breath. During the Royals’ 2015 championship season, his speed helped turn tight games in their favor. He became a fan favorite in Kansas City, even though he had not yet recorded a major league hit.That first hit finally came in 2018 with the Chicago Cubs, a single up the middle off Max Scherzer. Gore later returned to the Royals in 2019 and showed growth as a hitter, batting .275 with 14 hits and stealing 13 bases.He also played for the Los Angeles Dodgers, Atlanta Braves, and New York Mets. In 2021, he appeared in the National League Division Series with Atlanta. When the Braves later won the World Series, Gore made a video call to injured pitcher Charlie Morton so he could feel part of the celebration. That moment showed who Gore was.Born in Macon, Georgia, and raised in Gray, he was drafted by Kansas City in 2011 from Gulf Coast State College. After retiring, he lived in Panama City, Florida, where he trained young athletes and shared his love for speed and baseball.Terrance Gore finished his career without a home run and with just one run batted in. Still, he changed games, lifted teammates, and left a legacy built on effort, joy, and heart.",Terrance gore played in parts of eight seasons in major league baseball.

The network airs an NFL Films “Road to the Super Bowl” special at noon ET, then a five-hour Super Bowl LX pregame show starting at 1 p.m. ET, all leading into Patriots vs. Seahawks at 6:30 p.m. ET on NBC, Peacock, Telemundo, and Universo.For most fans, this is what your setup looks like:If you are watching in the UK, kickoff is set for 11:30 p.m. GMT on Sunday night. Channel 5 carries the game free-to-air, while Sky Sports Main Event and Sky Sports NFL, along with NOW TV and DAZN’s NFL Game Pass, give you subscription options.The Super Bowl 60 halftime show is not on a separate channel.If you want Bad Bunny, you stay exactly where you are.With kickoff at 6:30 p.m. ET, halftime usually lands somewhere between roughly 8 and 8:30 p.m. ET, depending on how long the first half actually takes. That means you should plan for Bad Bunny to hit the stage in that window if you are in the United States.For UK viewers, that roughly translates to 1 to 1:30 a.m. GMT on Monday morning. If you are only staying up for the Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show, you can afford to skip the first half, then jump in a little after 1 a.m. on Channel 5 or Sky.This is the Bad Bunny show as much as it is Patriots vs. Seahawks. The Puerto Rican star is the first solo Latin male artist to headline the halftime stage and is expected to perform an entirely Spanish-language set.He has already done the Super Bowl cameo thing once, when he joined Shakira and Jennifer Lopez back in 2020. This time, the stage is his, even if he refuses to spill details. Asked about surprise guests, he shrugged it off with “You know that’s something that I not gonna tell you” and kept the guest list locked down.The choice has also lit up the political crowd. Donald Trump has already said he will not attend after Bad Bunny and Green Day, who both oppose his politics, were chosen. He called the decision “a terrible choice” and said “I’m anti-them. All it does is sow hatred.” That is the climate around this halftime show before a single snap is played.If you are the type who watches Super Bowl Sunday like an awards show, the music lineup is loaded before Bad Bunny ever walks out.Here is the core list for Levi’s Stadium on Feb. 8:On top of the TV talent, NBC’s game broadcast will feature Mike Tirico on play-by-play, Cris Collinsworth in the booth, Melissa Stark and Kaylee Hartung on the sidelines, and Terry McAulay handling rules analysis.So if your group chat is split between Drake Maye vs. Sam Darnold talk and people who only care about Bad Bunny, Charlie Puth, and Green Day, this game is built for both sides. You get a full music festival wrapped around a Super Bowl rematch, and all of it lives on the same channels and streams you already use.","Super bowl lx kicks off on sunday, feb. 8, at 6:30 p.m. Et on nbc from levi’s stadium in santa clara, california.

Travis Kelce celebrates Super Bowl week with music, style, and a Swift-inspired moment

Super Bowl week is always loud, busy, and full of late nights. Travis Kelce made sure his week followed the same vibe. Even without Taylor Swift by his side, her presence still filled the room. At a party in the Bay Area, the Kansas City Chiefs star was spotted smiling, dancing, and clearly enjoying himself as one of Swift’s most famous songs played from the DJ booth.Kelce had earlier attended the NFL Honors ceremony, where he was nominated for the Walter Payton Man of the Year award. He did not win, but that did not slow him down. A few hours later, he showed up relaxed and upbeat at the “Tight Ends and Friends” party. Phones were out. Music was loud. And Kelce looked like someone who was ready to enjoy the moment.A short video shared by the New Heights podcast X account showed Travis Kelce standing between DJs Andrew Fedyk and Joe De Pace, known together as Loud Luxury.The timing felt intentional. As soon as Kelce settled in near the booth, the DJs played a mashup that blended You Belong With Me by Taylor Swift with We Found Love, produced by Calvin Harris.The crowd reacted instantly, and Kelce leaned into the moment rather than stepping back.Kelce did not stay quiet or reserved. He clapped, moved with the beat, and helped keep the energy up around the stage.At one point, he pulled out his phone and recorded the scene himself, smiling as the music played. It felt less like a publicity moment and more like something he wanted to remember later.When the DJs switched to “The Fate of Ophelia,” Kelce stayed right there, nodding along and soaking in the atmosphere instead of heading back into the crowd.Earlier that evening, Kelce had already made headlines at the NFL Honors ceremony. He arrived wearing a bold suit paired with sunglasses, a look that quickly stood out among the more traditional outfits.That same confidence carried into the party later, where his mood stayed light and relaxed. According to TMZ Sports, Kelce has been out and about in the Bay Area throughout the week.The outlet spoke with him at his own event on Wednesday, where he joked about how much Garage Beer he expects to have at his wedding reception.As of Friday, Swift had not been spotted in the city, but with Super Bowl weekend still unfolding, fans continue to watch closely.","Travis kelce attended the nfl honors ceremony and was nominated for the walter payton man of the year award.

With Super Bowl 2026 days away, pressure is building for players on the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks.

News at the EA SPORTS Madden Bowl on February 6, Saquon Barkley explained how players should handle the moment. “Best advice I would give to those guys playing on Sunday, it’s just another game,” Barkley said.“You’re going to have all the optics around it, probably be nervous for like the first ten seconds. But once the ball snaps, it’s the same game.”Barkley added that players should trust their preparation. “You just go out there and play the game that you know,” he said.His words come from experience after winning the Super Bowl with the Philadelphia Eagles and earning NFL Offensive Player of the Year honors in the 2025 season.After the Eagles’ Super Bowl win over the Kansas City Chiefs, Barkley’s fiancée Anna Congdon spoke about his journey.“This is everything,” she said in a post-game interview. “He works harder than anyone I’ve ever met.And this is the ultimate goal. It’s my dream to see him do this, living his dream.”The couple shares two children, and Barkley has often spoken about how family support keeps him grounded during high-pressure moments.While players prepare for kickoff, fans are also waiting for the halftime show.

Terrance Gore, one of baseball’s fastest and most trusted late-game runners, passed away on February 6, 2026. He was 34 years old. His wife confirmed that he died due to complications from a routine medical procedure. The news shocked the baseball world because Gore was still closely tied to the game and widely respected for doing one job better than almost anyone else, running when it mattered most.Gore never looked like a typical Major League Baseball player on paper. He did not hit much, and he did not play every day. But when games were close and pressure was high, teams wanted him on the field. His speed changed outcomes. That skill helped him win three World Series rings with three different teams, the Kansas City Royals in 2015, the Los Angeles Dodgers in 2020, and the Atlanta Braves in 2021. Very few players can say that.Money was never the headline of Gore’s career, but he still built a solid life through baseball. By 2026, his estimated net worth was about $2.5 million. That number came from his Major League salaries, postseason shares, signing bonuses, and smaller appearance or endorsement deals over eight seasons. His net worth grew slowly but steadily, starting around $1.51 million in 2022 and rising each year as he stayed valuable to winning teams.Terrance Gore played parts of eight MLB seasons with the Kansas City Royals, Chicago Cubs, Los Angeles Dodgers, Atlanta Braves, and New York Mets. Teams did not sign him for home runs. They signed him because one stolen base could change a season.His income mainly came from MLB contracts and postseason bonuses. Players on championship teams receive World Series shares, and Gore earned those three times. Even when he moved between rosters or spent time in the minors, teams kept him close because his skill was needed in October.In the modern baseball era, where numbers guide decisions, Terrance Gore proved that one elite skill still matters. He ran with purpose. He stole bases under pressure. And when the moment came, managers trusted him without hesitation.","Terrance gore was one of baseball's fastest and most trusted late-game runners. He won three world series rings with three different teams, the kansas city royals in 2015, the los angeles dodgers in 2020, and the atlanta braves in 2021. By 2026, his estimated net worth was about $2.5 million.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-128046768,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-2416613,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"

Boston Celtics strengthen roster with strategic Nikola Vucevic trade from Chicago Bulls

Nikola Vucevic brings experience and double-double power to Boston Celtics frontcourt

During this year's NBA trade deadline, the Boston Celtics traded a number of players, but they have also added a significant player in center. Nikola Vucevic, who will miss Wednesday's game against the Houston Rockets, has joined the team. The Bulls traded him to the Celtics, who then traded Anfernee Simons from the Celtics.The Celtics made three small trades before the 3 p.m. game after obtaining big man Nikola Vucevic and a second-round pick from the Chicago Bulls in exchange for guard Anfernee Simons. They have also sent Xavier Tillman to the Charlotte Hornets, Josh Minott to the Brooklyn Nets, and Chris Boucher to the Utah Jazz.After acquiring center Nikola Vucevic from the Chicago Bulls in exchange for guard Anfernee Simons, the Boston Celtics have added some depth to their front line for the postseason run. The Celtics acquired the talented big one day before the trade deadline, giving him a change of scenery after six seasons with the Bulls.Boston's tax burden will drop significantly as a result of the shift, from approximately $39 million to $17 million. The Celtics also have additional financial flexibility as part of the transaction, which they may use to make other deals. However, despite his Tuesday trade from Chicago to Boston, Vucevic isn't nearly ready to make his Celtics debut.Moreover, there was no mention of Vucevic in Boston's injury report that Celtics reporter Noa Dalzell issued on Friday. The omission of his name suggests that he will make his Celtics debut on Friday.The seasoned center will probably replace Neemias Queta in the starting lineup after he becomes comfortable with his new squad. Vucevic will possibly have his next opportunity to play against Miami on Friday. After this deal, Boston was a little shorthanded during Wednesday's game, but the fans could see the Celtics' newest roster in action on Friday against the Heat.Vucevic, a 35-year-old in his 15th season, is one of the most reliable double-double machines when he arrives in Boston. Vucevic has averaged 18.5 points and 10.5 rebounds a game during the past ten campaigns, officially recording double-doubles in eight of them.Vucevic is now joining his fourth franchise after playing for the Bulls, Philadelphia, and Orlando. Similar to his career averages of 17.2 points and 10.4 rebounds per game, he has averaged 16.9 points and 9.0 rebounds this season.With Xavier Tillman Sr., Luka Garza, and Neemias Queta making up Boston's center rotation, Vucevic joined a frontline that was lacking in experience. He has played in 1,020 regular-season games and 16 playoff games, including 10 with the Orlando Magic in 2018-20.Additionally, he has been with Chicago for the past five and a half seasons. He is now moving to Boston, where he will start at center right away. In 48 games this season, Vucevic has averaged 16.9 points, 9.0 rebounds, and 3.8 assists.","Nikola vucevic will miss wednesday's game against the houston rockets.

New Kids on the block opened the pop music door

Gloria Estefan changed the language of the halftime show

Prince set the gold standard in the rain

Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake changed tv forever

Kendrick Lamar and Rihanna redefined modern halftime shows

The Super Bowl halftime show has slowly turned into one of the biggest moments in global entertainment. While football remains the heart of the night, millions now watch just to see what happens during those 13 minutes on stage. As Super Bowl LX approaches with Bad Bunny set to perform, it is worth looking back at the moments that shaped how halftime shows are viewed today. These performances were not just concerts. They changed rules, broke records, and reflected culture in real time.For many years, halftime shows were led by marching bands and safe performances. That pattern broke in 1991 when New Kids on the Block became the first major pop act to headline.The show included a children’s choir and songs aimed at a family audience. It was not widely praised, but it mattered.Donnie Wahlberg later told Playboy, “I don’t know how much pride I take in the actual performance. But I take pride in the fact that we were the first ones to do it.”In 1999, Gloria Estefan made history by becoming the first Spanish-language artist to headline a Super Bowl halftime show.According to ESPN, her Miami performance blended English and Spanish and reflected the city’s culture.Years later, speaking to E! News, Estefan advised Bad Bunny ahead of his halftime moment, saying, “Enjoy every second because it really goes by so fast.”Many critics still point to Prince's 2007 as the greatest halftime show ever. Performing during heavy rain, Prince closed with “Purple Rain,” creating a moment that felt unplanned and unforgettable. The Athletic later wrote that no performer before or after has matched the impact of that night.Not every moment brought praise. In 2004, Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake were involved in a wardrobe malfunction watched by more than 140 million viewers, according to The Guardian. The incident led to stricter broadcast rules and changed how live TV was handled for years.In 2025, Kendrick Lamar delivered the most-watched halftime show ever, with 133.5 million viewers, according to Billboard.Two years earlier, Rihanna stunned fans by performing an entire set while pregnant, suspended above the field. BuzzFeed News praised the show for its calm confidence and control.","The super bowl halftime show has slowly turned into one of the biggest moments in global entertainment.

Coaching transition and future talent influence

The Philadelphia Phillies have chosen former Major League infielder Rubén Tejada as the new position coach of the Florida Complex League (FCL) Phillies, and it marks a new chapter in a long baseball career and a homecoming to the Phillies organization. This is a unique position that will see Tejada build the team with the youngest talent, bridging the gap between amateur talent and professional readiness as the Phillies look to establish organizational depth and readiness to help players succeed in the future.The hiring of Tejada is part of the Phillies' 2026 announcements regarding the player development staff, as Tejada will be added to a broader coaching staff dedicated to mentoring newcomers at the lowest levels of professional baseball. This is the first formal coaching job for Tejada, who will transition from his long playing career to a non-playing leadership position.The career of Ruben Tejada started in the year 2006 when he was signed as an international free agent by the New York Mets, and he rose to prominence through the minor leagues before he finally made his debut in the major leagues in 2010 with the Mets. During those ten years, he was regarded as a trustworthy infielder who could play as a shortstop, second baseman, and third baseman.Tejada had a nine-season MLB career, during which he recorded over 2,300 plate appearances and played for the Mets, St. Louis Cardinals, San Francisco Giants, and Baltimore Orioles. After his major league career, he played professionally in other leagues, such as winter ball and independent leagues, among others.In 2021, Tejada played briefly on a minor league contract again with the Philadelphia Phillies organization.Tejada's hiring as a position coach in the FCL marks his first official coaching engagement since his retirement as a professional player. In this position, he will collaborate with the youngest Phillies players and focus on defensive skills, positional play, and clear-cut habits essential to excel in professional baseball.As the Phillies get ready for the 2026 season, Tejada's return to Philadelphia is a big deal. He is a major leaguer who has played for multiple teams and is also a mentor to the team's future players.","Former major league infielder ruben tejada has been hired as the new position coach of the florida complex league (fcl) phillies.

My Two Cents on this Mock Trade

Thelook ready to push for contention after an uneven 2025 season. Their offseason already includes a major move which was signing Pete Alonso to a five-year, $155 million contract but the club may not be done. Trade talk around the league suggests Baltimore is exploring a deal for Detroit Tigers left-hander Tarik Skubal.Nothing has been finalized as of February 2026, but several mock trades identify the Orioles as a strong fit. If a deal happens, it would impact both divisions and force each team to balance present needs with future plans.One commonly discussed proposal has Baltimore Orioles acquiring Tarik Skubal, 28, who is entering his final year before free agency. Detroit would receive outfielder Dylan Beavers, ranked No. 69 among MLB prospects, along with right-handers Trey Gibson and Luis Leon.Skubal delivered one of the best pitching seasons in baseball in 2025. He finished 13-6 with a 2.21 ERA, 241 strikeouts, a 0.891 WHIP, and 195 innings. His production has placed him among the game’s top starters.The Tigers are at least listening because of a large arbitration gap. Skubal filed for $32 million, while the team countered at $19 million.Moving him now would prevent the risk of losing him after 2026 without a return.Beavers, 24, hit .304/.420/.515 with 18 home runs in Triple-A last season. Gibson, ranked No. 46 among MLB prospects, profiles as a potential starter. Leon adds another young arm who could help the bullpen.Tarik Skubal would lead a rotation that already includes Trevor Rogers, Kyle Bradish, and Shane Baz. Rogers posted a 3.12 ERA with 198 strikeouts in 2025, Bradish recorded a 3.39 ERA with 178 strikeouts, and Baz finished with a 3.87 ERA and 162 strikeouts.Projections suggest the Orioles’ World Series odds could rise from about 10% to 25% with an ace. Alonso, who had 264 home runs, a .272 average, and an .871 OPS in 2025, strengthens a lineup that also features Adley Rutschman (28 home runs, 92 RBIs) and Gunnar Henderson (32 home runs, 103 RBIs).The risk is control. Skubal could leave after one season if the Orioles do not extend him, similar to what happened when Corbin Burnes departed.Trading Skubal would not necessarily signal a rebuild. Detroit remained competitive in 2025, with Skubal also posting a 10-11 record, a 3.11 ERA, and 223 strikeouts.Beavers could fill a corner outfield role, Gibson provides rotation depth, and Leon strengthens the pitching staff. The Tigers would also save roughly $13 million in arbitration, giving them more payroll flexibility as they plan ahead for 2027.• The Orioles add a top starter and could approach a 90-win projection.• The Tigers gain controllable prospects while staying competitive.• Skubal is positioned to command a free-agent contract that may reach $400 million.• Baltimore would reduce its farm depth.• Detroit would be trading a franchise-level pitcher.• The Orioles risk getting only one season from Skubal.Baltimore Orioles would benefit immediately if Skubal performs at his usual level. Detroit’s advantage would likely come later by adding younger players and lowering payroll pressure.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Cincinnati Reds predicted to land $10.2 million New York Yankees star slugger in hopes of improving rotation and title odds The trade remains speculative, but its impact would be significant for both teams and could influence the American League race in 2026.","The baltimore orioles signed first baseman pete alonso to a five-year, $155 million contract.

When the moment demanded excellence, two established stars delivered while a new generation announced its arrival on the sport's biggest stage.Alina Muller and Lara Stalder shifted momentum throughout the Group A thriller against Czechia on Friday. The duo consistently created offensive chances and provided the spark Switzerland needed to erase a two-goal deficit in the final period, even helping their team secure the win.With an early goal from Kristyna Kaltounkova, Team Czechia seized the game in their favor early, but the Swiss didn’t allow the lead to continue for long. Just minutes later, Laura Zimmerman slapped the puck inside the net to level the game.But the Czechs soon turned the game in their favor as goals by Natalie Mlynkova and Tereza Plosova put their team ahead 3-1 with minutes remaining on the clock. While a victory looked unachievable, Switzerland refused to concede.Muller scored a power-play goal 10 minutes into the third period, orchestrating a tic-tac-toe sequence with Stalder and Ivana Wey that cut the deficit to one.Defender Lara Christen then rifled home the tying goal with less than three minutes remaining in regulation to force overtime.The Swiss controlled possession through the three-on-three overtime period before the game went to a shootout.

How a single vote cost Drake Maye the NFL MVP to Matthew Stafford,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/how-a-single-vote-cost-drake-maye-the-nfl-mvp-to-matthew-stafford/articleshow/128007901.cms,"Matthew Stafford (Getty Images)

Stafford’s MVP Win Defined by Heartfelt ""MVD"" Tribute from His Four Daughters

""To my four beautiful daughters... you guys are my 'why',""

The 5-Point Controversy: Was Drake Maye Robbed?

The ""Sam Monson"" Factor:

Value vs. Volume: Stafford had the ""volume"" (46 TDs), but Maye had the ""value,"" leading a rebuilding Patriots team to a 14-3 record with a significantly weaker supporting cast.

Efficiency: Maye led the league in completion percentage (72%) and passer rating (113.5).



The ""Super Bowl"" Irony: Fans were quick to point out that while Stafford was accepting a trophy, Maye was busy preparing to play in Super Bowl LX this Sunday.



Public and Celebrity Reaction: A Split Decision

The Legends: Tom Brady and Steve Young have been vocal in their support of Stafford, calling it a ""lifetime achievement"" win for a veteran who has finally earned his flowers.



The New Guard: Younger fans and analysts argue that the MVP award should go to the ""best player that year,"" not the player with the best story.

The Meme Wars: Today, February 7th, is Stafford's 38th birthday. Memes are already circulating of him ""stealing"" the trophy as a birthday gift from the voters.

On Thursday night at the NFL Honors, the league crowned Matthew Stafford as the MVP. But while the history books will record the 37-year-old Rams quarterback as the 2025 NFL MVP, the night was defined by a razor-thin voting margin and a surprise video that reminded everyone why he’s really playing.Before Stafford took the stage to accept his trophy, the room went quiet for a surprise video. In a clip that has since racked up millions of views, Stafford’s four daughters—Chandler, Sawyer, Hunter, and Tyler surprised their dad with a homemade tribute.They didn't talk about his league-leading 4,707 passing yards or his 46 touchdowns. Instead, they crowned him their ""MVD""—Most Valuable Dad. Stafford was visibly moved to tears, and when he finally took the stage, he was flanked by his daughters and his wife, Kelly.Stafford told the crowd. He then used the massive platform to put retirement rumors to bed, confirming he will return for the 2026 season.Despite the sentimental celebration, a storm was brewing on social media. Stafford won the award by just 5 points (366 to 361), the closest margin in 22 years.The debate centers on a single vote. Analyst Sam Monson revealed he used his first-place vote on Justin Herbert (who wasn't even a top-5 finalist).Because Maye lost by only 5 points, that one ""renegade"" vote effectively decided the race.Patriots fans and ""advanced stats"" enthusiasts are calling it a robbery, citing the following:The reaction has been a perfect reflection of the close vote:Matthew Stafford goes into the 2026 season with a Hall of Fame lock, an MVP trophy, and a title he clearly values more: Most Valuable Dad. But for Drake Maye, the 5-point snub might just be the fuel he needs to go from ""Runner-Up"" to ""Super Bowl Champion"" this Sunday.","Matthew stafford was crowned the 2025 nfl mvp on thursday night.

Poll Do you support Pakistan's decision to boycott the T20 World Cup match against India? Yes No

Dialogue is finally underway between Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) and the International Cricket Council (ICC) after Pakistan government's decision to boycott the T20 World Cup fixture against India in Colombo on February 15. It is learnt that the two parties have already exchanged emails in the last few days.The PCB has invoked Force Majeure citing the government instruction to not take the field versus their arch-rivals in the group stage of the multi-nation tournament. In the statement, the government didn't give any further explanation or justification for doing the same. In response, cricket 's global body has asked the PCB to justify how it tried to get out of the logjam as per the Terms of Participation.""Yes the PCB has invoked the Force Majeure but didn't give any further explanation or details. The ICC in response has asked the Pakistan board to demonstrate what it had done to mitigate FM,"" says a source tracking developments.Additionally, the conditions under which Force Majeure can be invoked were laid out by the ICC in its detailed response and stressed on the need of evidentiary threshold required for non-participation.The ICC has also highlighted the sporting, commercial and governance implications because of non-participation.With 8 days to the marquee clash, the ICC has kept the channels of dialogue open. The need to engage, not confrontation, is going to be ICC's approach while tackling the sensitive matter and all efforts would be directed to explore possible resolutions which doesn't affect the tournament and the game of cricket.The 2026 edition of the T20 World Cup got underway in Colombo and Mumbai today, but suspense around the India Pakistan fixture has continued since the social media post from the government of Pakistan and the subsequent comments by Shehbaz Sharif. While the PCB has yet to make a public statement on the matter, the team maintains that it will follow the government’s advice.“The India game, it’s not in our control. It’s a government decision, and we respect that. Whatever they are going to say, we do that,” Pakistan captain Salman Agha said during the captains’ conference.India captain Suryakumar Yadav, however, had a different take and said India will travel to Colombo as per plan and already have their tickets booked for the fixture.“Mindset is pretty clear,” Suryakumar said at the captains’ media briefing on Thursday in Mumbai. “We did not refuse to play them. The refusal came from them. ICC organised the fixture. BCCI and the Indian government decided to play at a neutral venue in coordination with ICC. Our flight to Colombo is booked. So we are going. We’ll see what happens later.”It now remains to be seen what happens to the fixture, but the two parties are engaged in dialogue and the next few days could provide some much-needed clarity.","Dialogue between pakistan cricket board (pcb) and the international cricket council (icc) the two parties have already exchanged emails in the last few days.

Travis Kelce loses major NFL honor as retirement rumors keep swirling around Chiefs star,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/travis-kelce-loses-major-nfl-honor-as-retirement-rumors-keep-swirling-around-chiefs-star/articleshow/127989106.cms,"Travis Kelce (via Getty Images)

Why this award matters, and what Kelce’s silence could mean for Kansas City

The retirement rumors around Travis Kelce continue to swirl in addition to the excitement about his marriage to Taylor Swift. However, fans will be disappointed with how the tight end failed to win a prestigious award recently. The NFL officially announced one of its biggest yearly awards, where Kelce was selected by his team as its nominee for the Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award, a recognition that carries real weight across the league.But when NFL Honors took center stage on Thursday, February 5, the award went to Washington Commanders linebacker Bobby Wagner instead. For Kelce and millions of his fans, it was a tough moment, especially for those still waiting and uncertain about his decision on whether he will return for another season.The Walter Payton NFL Man of the Year Award is not a typical trophy, as it is one of the league’s most respected honors because it recognizes both football excellence and impact away from the field. The award has been around since 1970 and is given to a player who stands out for leadership, charity work, and community service.According to the NFL, the winner receives “up to a $250,000 donation to the charity of his choice.”The league also supports every team nominee, with all 32 club winners receiving “up to a $40,000 donation to their charity of choice.” That support is a big reason why being nominated alone is considered a meaningful achievement.This year, the honor went to Wagner, a longtime leader and one of the most respected veterans in the sport. His acceptance speech was emotional and personal. Praising his dad, Bobby Sr., Wagner said, “I didn’t realize how hard it was to be a father until I got two kids of my own.” He also gave heartfelt credit to his mother, calling her “my rock,” and adding, “She’s the reason why I’m standing up here.”For Kelce, the timing is what makes this disappointing news hit harder. The Chiefs star has been linked to retirement talk for weeks, and he has not shut it down with a clear statement. On the January 7 episode of the New Heights podcast, Kelce explained his mindset to his brother and co-host, Jason Kelce. He stated that he plans on “just being a regular human for a couple weeks, maybe a month or so,” and then will try to figure out what he is going to do next in terms of his future in football.","Travis kelce was nominated for the walter payton nfl man of the year award.
