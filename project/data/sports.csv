GUWAHATI: Chennai Super Kings ( CSK ) are facing a tricky situation regarding MS Dhoni ’s batting position. Having drawn a lot of criticism for coming in to bat at No. 9 against Royal Challengers Bengaluru last week, Dhoni came in to bat at No.7 on Sunday against Rajasthan Royals.His team needed 54 off 25 balls at that point, but Dhoni couldn’t take this team over the line. When he departed after scoring 16 off 11 balls (1x4, 1x6) — Shimron Hetmyer taking a superb catch at deep mid-wicket — CSK still needed 19 off the last five legal deliveries from Sandeep Sharma. They failed to go the distance and lost by six runs.Asked to explain Dhoni’s flickering appearances with the bat and his changing batting positions, CSK head coach Stephen Fleming said, “It’s a time thing. It’s MS who judges it. His body, his knees aren’t what they used to be. He’s moving okay but there’s still an attrition aspect to it. He can’t bat 10 overs running full stick. So, he will gauge on the day what he can give us.“If the game is in the balance, he’ll go a little bit earlier and he backs other players when opportunities are up. So he’s balancing that. I said it last year, he is too valuable to us for leadership and wicketkeeping. To throw him in at 9, 10 overs... he’s actually never done that. So, from around 13, 14 overs he’s looking to go depending on the situation,” the former New Zealand captain said.Analysing their second straight loss this season after the opening win against Mumbai Indians, Fleming said, “It’s probably the two Powerplays. Our Powerplay with the ball went for best part of 80 runs and we were only able to manage mid-40s or early-40s. That’s the big difference.""We were also sloppy in the field compared to Rajasthan, who were outstanding. The start of a new three-year cycle (following a mega IPL auction) is always a little bit difficult, especially if you’re just short of a little bit of form.”","Ms dhoni came in to bat at no.7 on sunday against rajasthan royals.

Theare gearing up for a postseason push, but front-office decisions loom large in the upcoming free agency. One name that stands out as a potential target is Atlanta Hawks center, who could address the team’s glaring need for interior depth and defense.The Los Angeles Lakers have struggled with consistency at the center position this season. The Lakers’ blockbuster trade for Luka Doncic has propelled them to the No. 4 seed in the Western Conference. However, losing Davis has exposed their lack of interior presence, making them vulnerable against elite big men in the playoffs.

NHL fans rip into Brady Tkachuk after heated exchange with Blue Jackets

Brady Tkachuk , captain of the Ottawa Senators , is known for his aggressive and physical style of play. During a recent game against the Columbus Blue Jackets , his on-ice actions sparked backlash from fans, with some even calling him reckless and questioning his leadership. Some labeled him one of the worst captains, arguing that his aggression hurts the team.During the first period, Ottawa Senators captain Brady Tkachuk delivered a late shove to Columbus Blue Jackets forward Sean Monahan after he had already moved the puck. This aggressive move led Blue Jackets winger Kirill Marchenko to step in and confront Tkachuk in defense of his teammate. As a result, Tkachuk was assessed a roughing penalty.The incident sparked backlash on social media, with many NHL fans criticizing Brady Tkachuk’s actions. One tweeted saying, “Worst captain in sports.” Another one wrote, “Biggest fake tough guy in the league.” ""The fact he is even in this game is kinda crazy after he elbowed the guys head into the ice last game,"" one wrote. ""Crazy choice of caption from an organization full of TML fluffers. Guy gets grabbed by some no name basically wearing a bubble and ends up with the only penalty, brutal call,"" another wrote.""How Brady got a penalty is hilarious, and honestly I’m not surprised by the comments.. sportnet followers are as trashy as their panel,"" a user commented. ""So Brady gets jumped by a chickenshit with a full face shield and HE is the only player penalized? Make that make sense,"" another wrote.Tkachuk has always been a polarizing figure—while Senators fans appreciate his passion and leadership, others see his physicality as excessive. This isn't the first time he's drawn criticism for his rough play, as he often engages in fights and racks up penalty minutes.Despite the backlash, the Senators' management and coaching staff continue to support Tkachuk. General Manager Steve Staios and head coach D.J. Smith have praised his competitive nature, emphasizing that his emotional engagement is a key part of the team's identity. They believe his energy helps elevate the team, even if it occasionally leads to controversy.The Senators secured a 3-2 win over the Blue Jackets with goals from Ridly Greig, Drake Batherson, and Jake Sanderson. Boone Jenner and Kirill Marchenko scored for Columbus. Linus Ullmark made 29 saves for Ottawa, while Daniil Tarasov stopped 24 shots in the loss. Greig opened the scoring, but Jenner quickly equalized. Batherson and Sanderson extended Ottawa’s lead before Marchenko cut it to 3-2 in the third. Despite the late push, Columbus couldn't complete the comeback. Coach Travis Green praised the team's energy and effort, calling it a playoff-like game.Also Read: Miro Heiskanen injury update: Stars head coach reveals that he is making steady progress in recovery as the team prepare for playoffs While some fans criticize his leadership, others argue that his physicality and grit are exactly what the Senators need.

Michael Wilbon calls out ESPN’s priorities

ESPN under fire: Channing Frye, Charles Barkley, and Michael Wilbon criticize network’s shallow coverage of NBA

ESPN has come under fire for its relentless focus on Bronny James, and one of its own, veteran journalist Michael Wilbon , isn’t holding back. Wilbon, the longtime co-host of Pardon the Interruption, recently criticized the network for what he sees as an excessive push to make Bronny a daily topic. Speaking in an interview with Outkick, he revealed that ESPN executives attempted to get him and his co-host Tony Kornheiser to frequently discuss Bronny on their show—something they refused to do.During the interview, Michael Wilbon was candid about the pressure from higher-ups at ESPN to cover Bronny James extensively, even at the expense of more deserving basketball stories. He expressed frustration over the way the network prioritizes narratives that generate buzz over meaningful discussions about the game.""There were shows that talked about Bronny every day,"" Wilbon said. ""You know what shows I'm talking about. I don't care if my bosses get mad. They would try to get Tony and me to talk about it. No, we were not going to do it.""He acknowledged that as a father, he understands why LeBron James is so invested in his son’s career. However, he took issue with ESPN seemingly placing Bronny’s name above legitimate stars in the NBA.""They talked about him more than Shai Gilgeous-Alexander ,"" Wilbon added. ""That's pandering. It's all pandering. Let me be clear: our business is a piece of sh*t a lot of days.""Wilbon explained that Pardon the Interruption only covered Bronny when it was truly newsworthy—such as when he was drafted by the Lakers and when he played alongside his father on opening night. In contrast, he noted that other ESPN shows, particularly First Take, seemed to include Bronny in daily debates, overshadowing actual basketball discussions. Many fans have also voiced frustration, questioning whether ESPN's obsession with Bronny is truly about basketball or just a ratings ploy.Wilbon is not alone in his criticism. Former NBA player and analyst Channing Frye also recently called out ESPN after Stephen A. Smith falsely claimed that LeBron James did not attend Kobe Bryant ’s memorial. Frye took to social media to demand more accountability from the network.""Please don't lie. Please don't make sh*t up. Fact-check yourself,"" Frye posted. ""The beef is not fun when you've run out of things to talk about. Just don't lie to try and win an argument.""Meanwhile, NBA Hall of Famer Charles Barkley has been vocal about what he sees as ESPN’s repetitive and shallow coverage. While speaking on Inside the NBA, Barkley mocked ESPN’s fixation on teams like the Lakers and the Warriors, arguing that it dilutes real basketball conversations.""Them fools at the other network, which we're going to be working at next year, that's all they talk about,"" Barkley said. ""Y'all just want to talk about the Warriors and the Lakers... Y'all are idiots cause y'all talk about the Lakers and the Warriors all the time.""Wilbon’s remarks came at a time when First Take continued its back-and-forth with LeBron James, a feud that has dominated headlines. However, Wilbon emphasized that this issue is bigger than one individual or one show—it’s a reflection of the entire sports media landscape.""This isn't about Stephen A. It's the entire industry,"" Wilbon stated. ""That's what I want to remind LeBron. Our business is just sh*t some days. It just is.""As voices like Wilbon, Barkley, and Frye call for a shift in the way sports are covered, the future of sports journalism remains uncertain. The industry is at a crossroads, where it must decide whether to prioritize thoughtful, in-depth coverage or continue chasing sensational stories for ratings.Also Read: LeBron James opens up about the real reason behind his feud with Stephen A. Smith: “He’s on a Taylor Swift tour run” With the debate intensifying, it remains unclear whether calls for journalistic integrity will reshape the landscape or if viral content will continue to dominate.

NEW DELHI: If left-arm pacer Arshdeep Singh set the stage with the ball, it was Prabhsimran Singh who stole the show with the bat as Punjab Kings dismantled Lucknow Super Giants with a dominant eight-wicket win in their IPL 2025 clash on Tuesday.Prabhsimran played a breathtaking knock of 69 off just 34 balls, smashing the LSG bowlers all over the park.

Arshdeep Singh (3/43) led the charge, dismissing Mitchell Marsh for a golden duck in the first over and later accounting for Abdul Samad (27 off 12) and Ayush Badoni (41 off 33). Lockie Ferguson (1/26), Marco Jansen (1/28), Glenn Maxwell (1/22), and Yuzvendra Chahal (1/36) also chipped in with crucial breakthroughs.LSG’s innings lacked momentum, with Nicholas Pooran (44 off 30) being the only batter to provide resistance. Skipper Rishabh Pant’s struggles continued as he managed just 2 runs before falling to Maxwell. David Miller (19 off 18) and Samad tried to push the scoring rate, but Punjab’s disciplined bowling kept them in check.Digvesh Rathi (2/30) was the lone bright spot in LSG’s bowling attack, but he couldn’t stop Punjab’s aggressive chase.
