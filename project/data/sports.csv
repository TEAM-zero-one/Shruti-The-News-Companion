The Boston Celtics start a busy offseason by moving Jrue Holiday for Anfernee Simons



Pros and cons of Jrue Holiday and Anfernee Simons swap



The Boston Celtics have officially traded veteran guard Jrue Holiday to the Portland Trail Blazers in exchange for Anfernee Simons and two second-round draft picks. The deal, first reported by ESPN’s Shams Charania, marks a major shift for both franchises as they chart new paths heading into the 2025–26 NBA season. Holiday was a key part of Boston’s recent championship run, but with injuries and roster uncertainties, the team appears to be reshaping its future.Shams Charania broke the news on X, writing, “BREAKING: The Boston Celtics have traded Jrue Holiday to the Portland Trail Blazers for Anfernee Simons and two second-round picks, sources tell ESPN.” In a follow-up post, he elaborated: “Portland makes an aggressive move to re-acquire Holiday, who the franchise originally received from Milwaukee in the Damian Lillard trade in 2023 and later moved to Boston for a deal that included two first-round picks to the Blazers. Simons joins Boston on an expiring contract.”This marks the beginning of what could be a very active offseason for Boston. “An extremely active offseason begins for the Celtics with the trade of Jrue Holiday, who played a critical role in Boston's 2024 NBA championship. The Celtics remain engaged in trade talks surrounding multiple key players on the roster, sources said,” Charania added.While Jrue Holiday brought championship pedigree, defensive grit, and veteran leadership to Boston, the team’s early exit in this year’s playoffs.Holiday, 35, is under contract for two more years, earning $32.4 million next season and $34.8 million the following year, with a $37.2 million player option for 2027–28. The Celtics opted to pivot before the aging curve became a problem. On top of that, for the Celtics’ credit, they have secured two second-round picks.Anfernee Simons, meanwhile, offers youth and upside. The 26-year-old spent all seven seasons of his career with Portland and averaged 19.3 points per game last year. He is also coming off a three-year stretch where he averaged 20.7 points, 4.7 assists, shot 37.4% from three-point range, and hit 90.4% of his free throws.Though Simons’ current deal is expiring, the Celtics have flexibility. If he underperforms, they walk away clean. If he flourishes, they’ll be positioned to re-sign or extend a rising star. The trade also allows Boston to shed Holiday’s long-term salary commitment while betting on a player who fits their long-term timeline.For Portland, the move shows a renewed focus on defense and experience. Holiday’s championship background could serve as a stabilizing force in a young Blazers locker room.Also Read: Tyrese Haliburton breaks silence with a heartfelt message after Indiana Pacers’ devastating Game 7 loss to OKC Thunder in NBA Finals While time will reveal who truly won this trade, for now, Boston has made a calculated move that balances immediate upside and future flexibility, and the league is watching closely.","The boston celtics have traded veteran guard jrue holiday to the portland trail blazers in exchange for anfernee simons and two second-round draft picks.

MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander cements his legacy as Oklahoma City declares a day in his name



Downtown Oklahoma City turned into a sea of blue and orange on Tuesday as thousands of fans poured into the streets to celebrate a moment more than a decade in the making — the Thunder’s first-ever NBA championship. With the Larry O’Brien Trophy finally in hand, players and coaches paraded through a roaring crowd, cheered on by a city beaming with pride. At the center of the celebration was none other than Finals MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, whose incredible postseason performance not only etched his name in franchise history but also earned him a citywide tribute that stunned the crowd. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander stood at the heart of it all — shirtless, wrapped in a Canadian flag, and holding the NBA ’s ultimate prize high above his head. The 26-year-old guard had been electric throughout the playoffs, and the fans returned that energy tenfold as they celebrated with him during the Thunder’s championship parade.Across a grueling 23-game postseason run, he was nothing short of spectacular. Gilgeous-Alexander averaged 29.9 points, 6.5 assists, 5.3 rebounds, and shot nearly 88% from the free-throw line. His defining moment came in Game 7 of the NBA Finals against the Indiana Pacers , where he delivered 29 points, 12 assists, and played 40 critical minutes to lead Oklahoma City to a 104–97 win and its first-ever NBA title.But the most unforgettable moment of the parade didn’t come from the court — it came from the stage at Scissortail Park.Amid the confetti and deafening cheers, Oklahoma City mayor David Holt took the microphone and made an announcement that instantly became part of franchise lore: July 30, 2025, will officially be recognized as Shai Gilgeous-Alexander Day. The honor was meant to celebrate not just his clutch playoff run, but also his 2024–25 regular season MVP campaign — a rare double achievement for any NBA star, especially one still rising.Gilgeous-Alexander’s journey to this moment has been anything but linear. Drafted by the Charlotte Hornets in 2018, he was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers on draft night and spent just one season there before being dealt to Oklahoma City in the 2019 blockbuster Paul George trade. Since then, he has grown into more than just a franchise player — he’s become the face of the Thunder’s rebuild and now, its championship breakthrough.Under contract through the 2026–27 season, Gilgeous-Alexander is eligible for a four-year, $293 million supermax extension. Given his production, leadership, and deep connection with the city, it’s hard to imagine Oklahoma City letting their superstar go anywhere else.Also Read: “Hopefully I’m somewhere close” — MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander channels Kobe Bryant’s legacy in his defining 2025 NBA Finals moment The parade may have lasted only one afternoon, but the impact of Shai Gilgeous-Alexander’s historic postseason will echo across Oklahoma City for years to come.

NHL champions bring the Stanley Cup to Lionel Messi’s Inter Miami match at Hard Rock Stadium

Stanley Cup celebration rolls on as Florida Panthers take NHL trophy from championship parade to Lionel Messi’s Club World Cup match in Miami

Monday night at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami delivered a surprise that even Lionel Messi couldn’t overshadow. While fans came to witness Inter Miami’s showdown with Palmeiras in the FIFA Club World Cup, they also got a glimpse of a different kind of champion. The Florida Panthers, fresh off their 2025 Stanley Cup win, brought hockey’s most iconic trophy onto the soccer pitch. It was another wild chapter in the Panthers’ ongoing celebration tour — one that’s taken the Cup from beach bars to pool parties, and now, to the global soccer stage.The crossover moment happened on June 24, when five Panthers players — Aleksander Barkov , Dmitry Kulikov, Evan Rodrigues, Anton Lundell, and Niko Mikkola — arrived at Hard Rock Stadium with the Stanley Cup in tow. Panthers team president Matt Caldwell joined them as the group took part in the group stage match between Inter Miami and Palmeiras.At halftime, the players stepped onto the field to cheers from the crowd, parading the Cup proudly before thousands of fans. They also had the chance to meet with FIFA President Gianni Infantino, Arsène Wenger — FIFA’s Chief of Global Football Development — and 1998 World Cup winner Youri Djorkaeff.Following the match, Barkov swapped jerseys with Inter Miami defender Noah Allen — a moment that captured the spirit of the night: a blend of champions from different worlds, meeting at the intersection of passion and celebration.It wasn’t just a cameo. Whether it was coincidence or karma, Inter Miami, widely seen as underdogs entering the game, pulled off a thrilling 2-2 draw against Palmeiras — a result that secured their place in the Club World Cup Round of 16.The Hard Rock Stadium appearance was just the latest stop on the Stanley Cup’s whirlwind tour through South Florida. Over the past week, it’s been seen at Fort Lauderdale’s iconic Elbo Room, splashing around at Matthew Tkachuk’s poolside bash, lighting up the night at E11EVEN, and of course, front and center at Sunday’s championship parade.Despite the non-stop festivities, the Cup shows no signs of slowing down. With each new appearance, it continues to capture the energy of a team — and a city — riding the high of a back-to-back NHL title.What’s next for the world’s most famous trophy? If the past week is any clue, it’ll be somewhere loud, unexpected, and unforgettable.Also Read: Matthew Tkachuk played through a torn adductor and hernia to win the Stanley Cup—now faces surgery decision","Nhl champions bring stanley cup to lionel messi’s inter miami match at hard rock stadium.

Josh Jacobs and his family lived in motels and cars but he never let it break him



“I normalized a lot of things growing up,”

“Like I never thought, damn, I’m sleeping in a car.”

“That’s what made it real for me,”

“Knowing I could take care of the man who never stopped taking care of me.”

From Super Bowl ads to real-life change, Josh is using his platform to speak for others



Before he was stiff-arming defenders and breaking records, Josh Jacobs was just a kid living out of a car in Tulsa, Oklahoma. No spotlight. No cleats. Just a backseat, a protective dad, and a dream that didn’t seem real yet here he is.The Packers running back opened up again about his upbringing, and it’s the kind of story that hits different when you realize how far he’s come. It’s not just inspiring, it’s gut-wrenching, raw, and real.Josh was in middle school when his family’s living situation collapsed. With his dad and siblings, he bounced between motels and nights parked in a Chevy Suburban, where his father would stay up to protect them.Jacobs said.He didn’t complain. He didn’t crack. He just played football, got better, and stayed ready.When Jacobs was drafted in the first round of the 2019 NFL Draft by the Raiders, his first big move wasn’t flashy jewelry or a luxury car. It was buying his dad a house.That full-circle moment made headlines everywhere. And if you’ve ever seen the footage, his dad breaking down in tears, it’ll stay with you.Jacobs said.Jacobs didn’t just stop at personal wins, he told his story on a Kia Super Bowl ad, highlighting youth homelessness and partnering with programs to raise awareness.Every yard he gained during Super Bowl LIV meant real money donated to kids going through what he once lived.It’s the kind of advocacy that makes you see athletes as more than just players.This isn’t just a rags-to-riches tale, it’s about perseverance, perspective, and the power of staying grounded. Josh Jacobs could’ve folded under pressure. Instead, he turned his past into purpose.And now? He’s not just running toward touchdowns, he’s running for every kid still trying to make it out of that backseat.Also read - “You can’t troll your own brother”: Shedeur Sanders responds to Shilo’s savage roast","Packers running back josh jacobs opened up again about his upbringing.

Kevin Durant gave Emmanuel Acho a taste of his own medicine in a recent X-War

Kevin Durant-Emmanuel Acho X feud is not new

Kevin Durant gave it back in style to former NFL player Emmanuel Acho, who tried to write him off. Acho coined a bizarre way of calculating a player’s legacy. It was done only to take a jab at Durant’s frequent trades, which led him to play for different teams. Acho’s analysis did not sit well with the Phoenix Suns star. He clapped back at Acho, calling him ‘the worst linebacker of all time.’Durant was not wrong this time. Acho’s calculation was nonsensical at many levels. It put Stephen Curry at the top, even above LeBron James, who is considered the NBA GOAT. A fan pointed out the same and said that the logic placed Curry even higher than Michael Jordan.Kevin Durant has always criticized Acho for his unjust comments on legendary NBA players. They had indulged in an X war previously, where Durant lashed back at him for commenting on Jayson Tatum. He, however, didn’t mention his name that time. Acho’s comments have added fuel to the fire amidst Durant’s move to the Houston Rockets, who have acquired him in a blockbuster trade.Kevin Durant ripped apart the former NFL player, Emmanuel Acho, who came up with a bizarre method to establish a player’s legacy. Durant sarcastically called Acho ‘the worst linebacker of all time’ in response to his bizarre logic. He added a pinch of humor by calling his comment a result of ‘The Great Kevin Durant’s legacy formula that was created in the best labs at MIT.’ Here is Durant’s tweet:Previously, Acho demonstrated the player legacy theory.According to him, the number of championships divided by the number of teams played for equaled the player's legacy value - weird, isn’t it? As per his calculation, Stephen Curry had a legacy of 4.0, while Durant’s legacy was measured as 0.4.The X war between the two got heated up with the fans' comments. A fan asked Durant if changing teams should not be considered a negative. However, another fan also found the logic quite ridiculous as it placed Stephen Curry higher than even Michael Jordan. Jordan had also played for different teams during his career.Kevin Durant and Emmanuel Acho have not been at loggerheads for the first time. Acho, through his platform, FS1, has been commenting on NBA players and Durant previously, too.In May 2025, Emmanuel Acho made a bold claim that the Boston Celtics were doing better without Jayson Tatum. The comment was made when Tatum was out of action due to injury. It did not sit well with Durant, who openly criticized Acho and commented on X:“Hot take artist have ruined the sport. Football guys, no disrespect but yall boys need to stay in ya lanes… Dudes who quit football early to pursue media talkin mental toughness, cut it out.”Durant has always been vocal about the fact that only correct people should be doing the NBA games’ and players’ analysis. And, he never liked the fact that a failed NFL player was commenting on basketball legends, as per various media reports.Also Read: Kevin Durant plans to end career with Houston Rockets as extension talks loom ahead of 2025-2026 season Durant is all set to join the Houston Rockets as his fifth team via a blockbuster trade.

Ontario Hockey League’s Oshawa coach Brad Malone says Haoxi Wang’s hockey IQ with or without the puck is very high

Central Scouting’s Nick Smith calls Haoxi Wang an intriguing kid for the NHL clubs

Also Read:

Haoxi Wang, who goes by the name “Simon” in North America, was only four and a half years old when he followed his friend to watch his first ice hockey practice on an ice hockey rink in Beijing. The players looked like superheroes in their uniforms and gear, flying across the ice hockey rink.Wang shared with Adam Kimelman of NHL .com, “He(Wang’s friend) started playing, and he told me this upcoming sport is extremely cool. I went to watch one of his practices, and then I told my mom, I think I’m in love with this sport. I was four and a half at the time.” Thereafter, his love for the sport led him to the 2025 NHL Draft! What happened in between? Let’s find out.When Simon’s mother found out about his love for hockey, she built an ice hockey rink for him; in fact, that’s how her rink-building company started. That is not all - she went on to purchase the Ontario Junior Hockey League team where Haoxi Wang played. Wang played ice hockey defenseman for King Rebellion of the Ontario Junior Hockey League.Wang shared with Kimelman, “When I was 10, she(Willa Wang) saw this upcoming market of hockey and the Winter Olympics in China for 2022 at the time.She gathered a few partners of her and built a new rink in Beijing. And started to own the hockey club and the figure skating club. And that’s when I have all these amazing facilities to train at, when I was a kid, and build a lot of fundamentals and fundamental skills for me when I moved to Canada. ”In Canada, Haoxi Wang played for the Oshawa of the Ontario Hockey League. Brad Malone, coach at Oshawa, could not stop praising Wang. He shared with Kimelman, “You can’t teach size. You can’t teach his natural ability, his skating ability. I think his hockey IQ, both with and without the puck, is very high.He makes a lot of good decisions and a lot of really good reads. He’s a tough defender to beat. He understands the defensive side of the game.” Wang took a while to adjust to OHL, but his coach, Malone, did not see that. “For me, it was right away. You saw so many good intangibles as a hockey player: his skating, his size, his stick detail, his physicality, his confidence with the puck. Just the way he carried himself.”17-year-old Haoxi “Simon” Wang is on the roster of 2025-2026 Boston University of the NCAA Division 1. Wang received a “B” rating on NHL Central Scouting’s Preliminary Players to Watch in October 2025. He is projected to be a second-round or third-round 2025 NHL Draft pick.Nick Smith, NHL Central Scouting, shared with Mike G. Morreale of NHL.com, “We first noticed him last year as this tall, lanky kid who was physical and full of compete. In my first viewing this year, I couldn’t believe how smooth he was. He’s right up there with the best skaters in the draft, and at 6-foot-5, that’s remarkable. You throw in the physicality and compete, and you have a kid who’s very intriguing to the NHL clubs. His puck game is improving, and he’s putting up some decent numbers.”Back in October 2024, OJHL’s King Rebellion head coach Mark Joslin shared with Jim Mason of OJHL Communications, “It’s been crazy. We’ve had at least 15 to 20 NHL scouts at each of our home games this fall. And Simon had already been interviewed by some of those NHL teams.”","Haoxi wang, 17, is projected to be a second-round or third-round 2025 nhl draft pick.

Get ready for a fun game.This game pits the strong Dodgers against the fighting Rockies, with Los Angeles looking to stay atop their division. The Rockies have played well at home, winning half of their last 10 underdog games. Coors Field often sees big scores because of its high altitude, so betting over 12 runs could be smart.Still, experts think it’ll be a close game, with the Dodgers’ better team likely winning narrowly.

Shohei Ohtani's pitching schedule will stay conservative, says Dave Roberts

Dodgers managing Ohtani’s dual role with long-term strategy in mind

The return of Shohei Ohtani to the mound has been a storyline that has been closely followed during the final stages of his recovery and his return to his level in baseball, but Los Angeles Dodgers manager Dave Roberts had reins on intentions. Roberts said full build-up in the rotation this season, and perhaps the entire 2025, may never exist, even as Ohtani continues to pitch briefly this month.After Ohtani pitched one inning in his appearances against the Padres and Nationals, Roberts confirmed the Dodgers were not likely to follow a standard starter schedule for the two-way star. He was adamant that there is no finish line or a pitch count goal. Roberts added: “I think we’re always gonna be cautious. I mean, I have no idea what it even looks like to be built up fully. I don’t think anyone knows what that looks like because it is not some ordinary starting pitcher. To say six (innings) and 90 (pitches), I don’t know if we’ll even get to that point.”With Ohtani coming off a second major elbow surgery and his contributions as a designated hitter expected to be very high-value, the Dodgers are treating every inning Ohtani pitches as a bonus.The team is surviving on arms with a staggering 13 pitchers on the injured list. Instead of pushing Ohtani back into the rotation, though, they are taking a steady, thoughtful approach to maintain his overall well-being.Ohtani's unique value to the team stems from his command both on the mound and in the batter's box, which leaves the end goal of managing him far less straightforward than your average player. Roberts also acknowledged that marrying Roberts' elite hitting with the slow, careful building that continues on the pitching side of things will be crucial. Ohtani's bat is arguably the most important on the team, and with him leading the Angels in several offensive categories, it's dangerous to jeopardize that with an aggressive pitching agenda.Also Read: Shohei Ohtani touches 100 mph in electric 2025 pitching debut for Dodgers Ohtani quickly drew attention with good flashes in his two short outings (he allowed an earned run against San Diego but rebounded with a clean inning and two strikeouts against Washington). However, the hope is that he stays in short relief-type situations or as an opener. Volume is not a goal for the Dodgers, merely efficiency and durability. So, as Roberts pointed out, there is no normal for a non-normal human like Ohtani, and anything he gives you on the mound this year, or even next, is icing on the cake.","Shohei ohtani's pitching schedule will stay conservative, says dave roberts.
