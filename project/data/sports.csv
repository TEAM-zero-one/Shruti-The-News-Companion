Justin Bieber’s love for the Maple Leafs runs deeper than any runway

Hailey Bieber turns heads at Met Gala 2025 without her other half



When it’s Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Playoffs and your team’s on the ice, even the Met Gala has to wait. That’s exactly what happened on Monday night when Justin Bieber, certified Canadian royalty and lifelong Maple Leafs fan opted for a night of hockey over couture. While Hailey Bieber lit up the red carpet solo in New York, her husband was spotted tuned into the Leafs’ playoff game from home, proving once again that for Bieber, hockey comes before high fashion.This isn’t the first time Justin Bieber has worn his fandom on his sleeve (literally). The pop superstar has long been a vocal and visible supporter of the Toronto Maple Leafs , even designing limited-edition jerseys for the team through his fashion label Drew House. So his decision to skip the Met Gala and stay home to watch the Leafs take on the Panthers? Totally on-brand.Bieber didn’t appear at any Met Gala afterparties either, making it clear he was in full playoff mode. The NHL’s opening round is serious business and apparently more important than hobnobbing with Anna Wintour and Zendaya.Hailey made her own headlines at the Met, arriving solo in a minimalist black custom Saint Laurent mini dress blazer. While she looked stunning (as always), fans quickly noticed Justin's absence. It marked the second consecutive year the couple didn't walk the red carpet together, sparking chatter online about their diverging public appearances.But just hours later, Bieber posted his support for Hailey on Instagram, proving there's no drama, just different priorities. For him, that priority was watching the Leafs win Game 1, even as goalie Anthony Stolarz was hospitalized after a brutal hit.Whether intentional or not, Bieber's Met Gala absence turned into a wholesome moment of national pride. Hailey served Met Gala glam, Justin repped his team, and somewhere in between, the internet got a classic Canadian celebrity moment to obsess over.Also read - “He gets away with everything”: Maple Leafs fans furious as Sam Bennett avoids suspension for hit that hospitalized goalie Anthony Stolarz","Justin bieber skipped the met gala to watch the toronto maple leafs play the florida panthers.

What if Evan Mobley misses tonight’s Game 2 against the Indiana Pacers?

Indiana Pacers vs Cleveland Cavaliers Game 1 overview

The’ playoff hopes took a hit after a Game 1 loss to the Indiana Pacers , and their injury woes are mounting. Evan Mobley, a key piece of the Cavs’ defense and offense, is now questionable for Game 2 after rolling his ankle in the series opener.Evan Mobley downplayed the injury postgame but the sight of him limping during the game has raised concerns. The 23-year-old big man is averaging 14.8 points and 7.2 rebounds in the playoffs, making his potential absence a major blow.Alongside Mobley, Darius Garland (toe) and De’Andre Hunter (dislocated thumb) are also questionable, leaving Cleveland severely shorthanded.If Evan Mobley can’t go, the Cavs will rely even more on Donovan Mitchell to carry the offensive load. Sam Merrill, who has started in Garland’s place, may again step into the lineup. Jarrett Allen’s role in the paint becomes even more critical without Mobley’s presence.The Pacers, meanwhile, will look to exploit Cleveland’s weakened roster and push for a 2-0 series lead. Game 2 could hinge on Mobley’s availability—and whether the Cavs can adjust if he’s sidelined.On May 4, 2025, the Indiana Pacers defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 121–112 in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference semifinals. The Pacers dominated the majority of the game after taking an early 11-point lead in the first quarter. Aaron Nesmith's three-pointer halfway through the third quarter, which increased Indiana's advantage to 12 points and set off a Cavaliers comeback attempt, was a crucial moment.Also read: Pascal Siakam injury update (Game 2, May 6, 2025) - Is the Indiana Pacers star cleared for tonight's game against the Cleveland Cavaliers? Tyrese Haliburton, who finished with 22 points, 13 assists, rebounds, three blocks, and a steal, led a decisive 20-10 run in the closing seconds, including a pivotal three-pointer and a block. Andrew Nembhard, who shot five out of six from three-point range, also had a stellar game with 23 points and six assists. The Cavaliers struggled with their three-point shooting, making only 9 of 38 shots from beyond the arc despite Donovan Mitchell's 33 points. The Pacers won on the road thanks to their balanced assault and excellent shooting.","Cleveland cavaliers lost 121-112 to the indiana pacers in game 1 of the eastern conference semifinals.

Can the Cleveland Cavaliers survive without their stars?

Theentered the Eastern Conference Semifinals with high expectations. But their momentum hit a wall in Game 1 against the Indiana Pacers, who stunned the Cavs with a road victory. A key factor in Cleveland’s loss was the absence of All-Star guard, who remains sidelined with a sprained left big toe.With Game 2 looming, Garland’s status is under scrutiny. Here’s the latest on his availability and how the Cavs’ injury report could shape tonight’s matchup.Darius Garland has missed three consecutive games due to a lingering toe sprain. Despite his eagerness to return, the Cavs are cautious about rushing him back.Key updates on Garland’s condition:- Listed as questionable for Game 2.- Experienced significant swelling and pain, per Jared Greenberg’s report.- Participated in light practice Monday but remains day-to-day.Darius Garland’s absence has been glaring. In the two playoff games he played against Miami, he averaged 24 points and 7 assists—production Cleveland sorely missed in their Game 1 loss.Garland isn’t the only concern for the Cleveland Cavaliers. Two other key players are questionable for tonight:1. Evan Mobley (left ankle sprain)- Suffered the injury in Game 1.- Recorded a 20-point double-double before exiting.- Critical as Cleveland’s defensive anchor.2. De’Andre Hunter (dislocated finger)- Injured during the series opener.- His absence would further thin the Cavs’ frontcourt depth.Here’s a quick breakdown of the Cavs’ injury report:The Pacers exposed the Cleveland Cavaliers’ vulnerabilities in Game 1, capitalizing on their lack of backcourt creativity without Garland. If Mobley and Hunter also sit, the Cavs face an uphill battle:- Offensive struggles: Garland’s playmaking relieves pressure on Donovan Mitchell. Without him, the offense becomes predictable.- Defensive gaps: Mobley’s rim protection is irreplaceable. Indiana’s fast-paced attack could exploit his absence.- Depth concerns: Hunter’s versatility helps counter the Pacers’ perimeter shooting. Losing him strains an already thin rotation.Garland’s final status will be determined closer to tip-off. While he’s optimistic about playing, medical staff may err on the side of caution. The same applies to Mobley and Hunter.Also read: Cleveland Cavaliers vs Indiana Pacers final injury report (Game 2, May 6, 2025) - Is Evan Mobley playing tonight against the Indiana Pacers?

The role models girls deserve: How Dwyane Wade’s daughter sparked his Chicago Sky investment



Beyond the sidelines: How Dwyane Wade is helping transform the WNBA



DWade & Angel Talk Dealing With Haters, Sacrificing To Win + A Special Appearance From Gab Union

Dwyane Wade spent 16 years building a Hall of Fame NBA career. But nearly a decade after hanging up his jersey, he's taken on a new role—one as personal as it is professional: part-owner of the Chicago Sky . His 2023 investment in the WNBA franchise wasn’t about headlines or business strategy; it was about family. Specifically, his daughter.In August 2024, Dwyane Wade sat down for an interview on CBS and pulled the curtain back on what led him to the Sky. It came down to this: his daughter, Zaya, deserved the same kind of heroes his son, Zaire, had growing up.“The big part of that is that my son, Zaire, grew up, and he had a dream of being in the NBA. He had a dream of being like his favorite players,” Wade said. “You understand the importance of role models, and so, I want my daughter to have that same feeling.”That idea stuck with him. Zaya , a proud transgender teen and public advocate, didn’t always have athletes to look up to who reflected her identity or the future she dreamed of. Wade wanted to change that, not just for Zaya, but for girls everywhere who needed to see what was possible.Right now, few players represent that kind of possibility like rookie forward Angel Reese . She's brought her signature fire from LSU to the pros and is already turning heads with the Sky. To Wade, she’s one of the bold new faces of the league, confident, authentic, and unshakably herself. Someone like Zaya and millions of girls could point to and say, “That could be me.”Wade’s investment isn’t a passive one. He’s not just sitting courtside and cashing checks, he’s leaning in, learning, and trying to figure out where he can make a real impact. On the ‘Unapologetically Angel’ podcast, he talked about the responsibility that comes with being a part-owner of a WNBA team. And it starts with listening.“I’m a fan of the game, I’m someone who knows the game of basketball,” he said. “But I’m also someone who’s willing to sit and learn and listen.”It’s about understanding what the WNBA needs: more visibility, more resources, more respect, and helping to make that happen. Wade’s goal isn’t to step in and save anything; it’s to show up, do the work, and use his platform to push the women’s game forward.Wade’s work with the Sky lines up with everything he and his family have been championing off the court. In recent years, he’s become a prominent voice for LGBTQ rights , especially through Translatable, the project he launched with Zaya to support queer youth. His activism isn’t performative, it’s deeply personal. And investing in the Sky is part of the same mission: helping build a world where young people, especially girls and LGBTQ kids, feel seen and supported.There’s something powerful about the way all of this connects. Basketball brought Wade fame, wealth, and purpose. Now, he’s using that platform to give others, including his daughter, a chance to dream just as big.Also Read: “We getting a chance to see who can really hoop” — Dwyane Wade backs referees for letting physicality play out Dwyane Wade’s move into WNBA ownership isn’t a career pivot — it’s an evolution. He’s still chasing wins, but now, they’re measured in representation, opportunity, and impact. And this time, he’s playing for something bigger than a championship: he’s playing for his daughter, and for every kid who deserves to believe they belong. The Chicago Sky are part of a bigger vision: one where the next generation of athletes, no matter their gender or identity, can grow up with heroes who look like them. And that future feels a lot closer when someone like Wade is helping to build it.","Dwyane wade is part-owner of the chicago sky.

Breanna Stewart and other WNBA stars shine at the met gala ahead of 2025 season

Breanna Stewart made a powerful fashion statement at the 2025 Met Gala, turning heads and capturing hearts with an outfit that resonated far beyond the red carpet. The New York Liberty star wore a sharply tailored, all white tuxedo ensemble inspired by the cult-classic film The First Wives Club, earning applause from fans and fellow WNBA players, including Indiana Fever guard Sydney ColsonSydney Colson, who’s also part of the LGBTQ+ community, shared a photo of Stewart on X with the caption, ""The lesbian representation we needed in the final scene of First Wives Club.” The post quickly went viral.Stewart’s look featured a low-cut tuxedo jacket, wide-leg trousers, a long overcoat, square-toe boots, and a crisp fedora. It paid homage to a powerful moment in pop culture history while also spotlighting authentic queer representation in sports and fashion. Stewart, who is married to a former WNBA player, Marta Xargay Casademont, continues to use her platform to support and elevate LGBTQ+ voices.Breanna Stewart wasn't the only WNBA player to make waves at the Met Gala. Angel Reese and Sabrina Ionescu also attended, with Reese serving on the host committee. The appearance of multiple WNBA stars at such a high-profile fashion event shows how the league’s influence continues to expand off the court.Meanwhile, Stewart is gearing up for her ninth WNBA season, having re-signed with the Liberty for a one-year deal.

Gujarat Titans aim to recover from the blow dealt by young sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi when they face a struggling Sunrisers Hyderabad in an IPL match tonight (May 2).Suryavanshi stunned GT with his incredible performance, hitting the season’s fastest century in just 35 balls and becoming the youngest IPL centurion at only 14 years and 32 days old.Despite an eight-wicket loss — post a strong 209/4 score — the result hasn't altered GT's position in the league. The Titans remain one of the most consistent teams this season, boasting a balanced squad with strengths in both batting and bowling.Led by Shubman Gill, they sit comfortably with six wins out of nine matches (12 points). Just two more wins from their last five fixtures would secure a spot in the playoffs, reaching the 16-point threshold.GT's in-form top order gives them confidence, especially with standout Sai Sudharsan, who is second in the Orange Cap race with 456 runs and five fifties. Gill (389 runs) and Jos Buttler (406 runs) also rank among the season’s top batters, making a formidable trio despite recent challenges.Earlier this season, GT defeated SRH convincingly in Hyderabad by seven wickets, thanks largely to Mohammed Siraj's impressive 4/17 spell. They’ll be hoping for a similar performance this time.Meanwhile, SRH find themselves in a critical position, needing wins urgently. The runners-up last season have struggled — just three wins in nine matches — and sit ninth on the points table. Another loss could effectively eliminate their playoff hopes.While SRH have seen flashes of brilliance from openers Abhishek Sharma and Travis Head, consistency remains elusive for the team.The pitch at Narendra Modi Stadium favours the batters, which should benefit SRH. In five of the eight matches played at Motera, teams have scored over 200 runs, highlighting the batting-friendly conditions. Bowlers are likely to struggle, particularly in the second innings, as dew is expected to make an impact.Shubman Gill (C), Sai Sudharsan, Jos Buttler (WK), Sherfane Rutherford, Shahrukh Khan, Washington Sundar, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Sai Kishore, Mohammed Siraj, Prasidh KrishnaImpact sub: Karim Janat/Ishant SharmaTravis Head, Abhishek Sharma, Ishan Kishan, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Heinrich Klaasen (WK), Aniket Verma, Kamindu Mendis, Pat Cummins (C), Harshal Patel, Simarjeet Singh, Zeeshan AnsariImpact sub: Mohammed ShamiGujarat Titans squad : Shubman Gill (Captain), Jos Buttler (wk), B Sai Sudharsan, Shahrukh Khan, Sherfane Rutherford, Rahul Tewatia, Rashid Khan, Kagiso Rabada, Ravisrinivasan Sai Kishore, Mohammad Siraj, Prasidh Krishna, Ishant Sharma, Washington Sundar, Glenn Phillips, Anuj Rawat, Mahipal Lomror, Arshad Khan, Jayant Yadav, Nishant Sindhu, Kulwant Khejroliya, Gerald Coetzee, Manav Suthar, Kumar Kushagra, Gurnoor Brar and Karim Janat.Sunrisers Hyderabad squad : Pat Cummins (c), Ishan Kishan (wk), Atharva Taide, Abhinav Manohar, Aniket Verma, Sachin Baby, Smaran Ravichandran, Heinrich Klaasen (wk), Travis Head, Harshal Patel, Kamindu Mendis, Wiaan Mulder, Abhishek Sharma, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Mohammed Shami, Rahul Chahar, Simarjeet Singh, Zeeshan Ansari, Jaydev Unadkat, Eshan Malinga.In Ahmedabad on Friday, temperatures are expected to be quite hot, reaching up to 44°C during the day.

She reiterated this point in her recent interview and said, ""It's still an issue, every single day. There's not ever equal coverage."" The media coverage gap is particularly clear in the WNBA, a league primarily made up of Black women.Despite this, white players like Bueckers and Caitlin Clark often receive more media attention. Bueckers acknowledged this imbalance, ""I feel like I've worked extremely hard, blessed by God. But I do think there's more opportunities for me. I feel like even just marketability, people tend to favor white people, white males, white women.""The underrepresentation of Black women in sports media has wider consequences, affecting the visibility of their achievements and the stories told about their careers. During the ESPY Awards, Bueckers had said, “With the light that I have now as a white woman who leads a Black-led sport, and celebrated here, I want to show a light on Black women.""“They don’t get the media coverage that they deserve. They’ve given so much to the sport, and the community, and society as a whole, and their value is undeniable. …She further added, “Sports media holds the key to storylines. Sports media and sponsors tell us who is valuable, and you have told the world that I matter today. And everyone who voted, thank you. But I think we should use this power together to also celebrate Black women.”","Paige bueckers says black women are undercovered by sports media. The wnba star said that black female athletes are undercover and do not get the visibility white female athletes do.

India's squad for the upcoming tour of England is set to be picked in two weeks' time, the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) secretary Devajit Saikia confirmed the development to TimesofIndia.com.""The team will be picked in two weeks' time,"" says Saikia.As TOI.com had reported earlier, the Indian cricket board has already prepared a pool and logistics for some India A players have already begun. The A squad, which will be featuring in three four-day games before the Test series begins on June 20, is very likely to leave for England on May 25.The players who would be busy with their franchise commitments in the ongoing Indian Premier League (IPL) will be joining the squad later. The Test squad departure is likely in the first week of June as some players are likely to feature in the second four-day game, which precedes the intra-squad fixture scheduled for the second week of June.It is reliably learnt that some senior players want to have a hit in one of the unofficial Tests, not the intra-squad game, before the series opener but that would depend on how far their respective team goes in the ongoing IPL coupled with necessary clearances from the medical team. Since it's a long tour, the Indian cricket board wants to ensure that the players are well rested and recovered after a gruelling season of the IPL.This could well mean that the Test squad players will leave in batches in the first week of June. Even for the tour of Australia, players left in batches. Both Dhruv Jurel and KL Rahul, who were part of the Test squad, were flown in early to play the second unofficial Test vs Australia A, to get much-needed game time.Similar drill could be followed this time around, too, especially for the players who are yet to have a taste of England in their career.",India's squad for the upcoming tour of england is set to be picked in two weeks' time.
