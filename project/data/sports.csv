Poll Is Vaibhav Suryavanshi the future star of Indian cricket? Not sure yet Maybe, let's see Absolutely

NEW DELHI: Rajasthan Royals ' 14-year-old sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi stole the show on Monday with a breathtaking 101 off just 38 balls against Gujarat Titans at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium in Jaipur. In an innings studded with 11 sixes and seven fours, the teenager shattered multiple records and led the Royals to a commanding eight-wicket win with 25 balls to spare.Chasing a daunting target of 210, Suryavanshi and Yashasvi Jaiswal (unbeaten on 70 off 40 balls) put on a whirlwind 166-run opening stand in just 11.5 overs, dismantling a Titans attack boasting Mohammed Siraj, Ishant Sharma, Prasidh Krishna, Rashid Khan, and Sai Kishore.The highlight was Suryavanshi's 35-ball century, making him the youngest player to score a hundred in senior T20 cricket at just 14 years and 32 days. He surpassed Maharashtra's Vijay Zol, who previously held the record at 18 years and 118 days. Suryavanshi also became the fastest Indian to an IPL century, breaking Yusuf Pathan's 37-ball record set in 2010.Suryavanshi's blitz made a mockery of the chase and ensured the Royals' slim playoff hopes remained alive. They climbed to eighth place with six points, while Gujarat Titans slipped to third after suffering their third defeat in nine games.Earlier, Shubman Gill 's 50-ball 84 and Jos Buttler's 26-ball unbeaten 50 had set up what seemed a formidable total for the Titans. However, once Suryavanshi started launching balls into the stands, there was little the Titans could do to stem the onslaught.""His hitting was tremendous,"" said Titans skipper Gill after the match. Jaiswal, the Royals' senior opener, summed it up simply: ""Incredible, one of the best innings I have seen. I just told him to keep going.""While India has seen prodigies fade under the weight of early fame, Suryavanshi's rare talent is a gift that needs careful nurturing. It will be interesting to see what is in store in the next chapter of this extraordinary story.",Rajasthan royals beat gujarat titans by eight wickets in ipl.

NEW DELHI: There has been a lot of chatter among cricket fans regarding Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) owner Sanjiv Goenka 's strict approach. Many believe Goenka demands strong results from his team. The discussions intensified recently after Goenka’s interactions with Rishabh Pant following LSG’s defeats sparked fresh speculation.The conversation around Goenka’s involvement began last year when he was seen having a heated discussion with then-captain KL Rahul after LSG’s heavy loss to SunRisers Hyderabad.

He was making the 11s, making all the changes, and planning. But this year, I don't feel like that. This year, after Zaheer Khan has come, I feel like he is talking to everyone.

Why the Los Angeles Lakers Might Consider Trading LeBron James for Giannis Antetokounmpo

""Rob Pelinka could decide to ignore any loyalty to LeBron and trade the 40-year-old star to the Bucks for Giannis Antetokounmpo, thereby creating a Luka-Giannis pairing that would be more potent than the current Luka-LeBron duo.""

The Mechanics of a Potential Trade

Key Factor



Details



LeBron’s Player Option



LeBron James holds a $52.6M option for 2025-26. If he opts in, he can veto any trade due to his no-trade clause.



New Contract Possibility



If LeBron signs a new deal without a no-trade clause, the Los Angeles Lakers could move him mid-season.



Salary Matching



A third team may be needed to balance salaries, as Giannis Antetokounmpo is owed $121.2M over the next two years.





Why the Bucks Might Entertain This Deal

After pulling off a blockbuster trade for Luka Dončić earlier this year, he might be eyeing another franchise-altering deal—one that could seeshipped to the Milwaukee Bucks in exchange forThe Los Angeles Lakers' current season appears to be ending in disappointment, with a first-round exit looming. While most expect the team to retool around Dončić and James, Rob Pelinka could opt for a more aggressive approach. LeBron’s Age vs. Giannis’ Prime: At 40, LeBron is still elite, but Giannis is 30 and in his peak years.- Long-Term Success: A Dončić-Antetokounmpo duo could dominate the league for years.- Bucks’ Desperation: With Damian Lillard’s Achilles injury, Milwaukee’s championship window may have closed, pushing Giannis Antetokounmpo toward a trade request.As Colin Keane of Sporting News noted in the original report:For this deal to happen, several financial and contractual hurdles must be cleared.While trading Giannis for an aging LeBron seems lopsided, Milwaukee’s situation is complicated.- Giannis’ Trade Demand: If he requests a move, the Bucks lose leverage.- Marketing Boost: LeBron’s star power keeps Milwaukee relevant during a rebuild.- Future Planning: The Bucks may need to reset their roster for the 2030s.Rob Pelinka has a history of making unexpected moves, and this one would be his biggest yet. While trading LeBron James seems unthinkable, pairing Dončić with Giannis Antetokounmpo could secure the Los Angeles Lakers ’ future.

Jacksonville Jaguars’ 2025 draft blunder: Skipping defensive tackle could ruin their season,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/jacksonville-jaguars-2025-draft-blunder-skipping-defensive-tackle-could-ruin-their-season/articleshow/120698654.cms,"Defensive struggles continue to haunt the Jaguars (Imagn Images)

Defensive struggles continue to haunt the Jaguars



Trusting the development of young defensive tackles

The 2025 NFL Draft has come and gone, and teams are now left to reflect on their selections and the holes they still need to fill. For the Jacksonville Jaguars , one glaring question remains: Why didn't they draft a defensive tackle despite their struggles on defense last season? The team’s decision not to address this need is raising eyebrows, especially given their poor performance in critical areas like run defense and pass rushing.The Jaguars' defense has been far from elite, ranking 31st in the NFL by allowing 5.9 yards per play last season. Adding to the concern, they were last in both pass yards allowed and forced turnovers, with a dismal total of only nine takeaways. The interior defensive line has been particularly problematic, struggling to stop the run and pressure the quarterback. This led many to believe that the team would use their draft picks to bolster the defensive tackle position.However, Jacksonville's front office took a different approach. Despite these glaring defensive issues, general manager James Gladstone explained that the team chose not to ""reach for a player"" at defensive tackle. This decision suggests a strong belief in the young players already on the roster and a commitment to developing them further in Year 2.The Jaguars are putting their trust in young defensive tackles Maason Smith and Jordan Jefferson to improve their performances. Smith, in particular, showed promise towards the end of the 2024 season, recording two sacks and three tackles for loss over the final three games. The team hopes this momentum will carry over into the new season, providing the interior rush that has been lacking.Additionally, the move to shift Arik Armstead back inside from defensive end is expected to give the defensive line a boost. Armstead’s versatility and experience could provide the needed push for the Jaguars' defensive front to perform better against both the run and the pass.Also Read: “Have lost faith in Justin Tucker”: Ravens’ decision to draft Tyler Loop hints at the end of Justin Tucker’s future in the team amidst his ongoing scandal This decision may be a gamble, but the Jaguars are confident in the potential of their younger players. By avoiding the defensive tackle position in the draft, they are sending a message that they believe their existing talent can rise to the occasion. Only time will tell if this strategy will pay off, or if it will come back to haunt them as they face more powerful offenses in 2025.","The jaguars' defense has been far from elite, ranking 31st in the nfl by allowing 5.9 yards per play last season.

In WWE’s history, managers have played a crucial role in shaping the careers of some of the biggest superstars. Whether it was by cutting unforgettable promos, masterminding heel turns, or simply offering an imposing ringside presence, the best managers left an unforgettable memory on the industry. Here’s a look at the top five who stood out the most.Few managers understood their characters better than Paul Bearer. With his haunting voice and fantastic persona, Bearer perfectly complemented The Undertaker, Kane, and Mankind. His ability to create fear and suspense added a new dimension to the supernatural storylines of WWE’s New Generation Era. Whether carrying the funerary urn or plotting revenge against his former allies, Bearer’s intelligence and psychological games made him unforgettable.“Classy” Freddie Blassie brought street-smart wisdom to his managerial career after retiring from the ring. Blassie’s association with villains like The Iron Sheik, Kamala, and King Kong Bundy elevated their careers in a period when foreign heel gimmicks dominated. His sharp mind and unapologetic behaviour set the blueprint for what a manager could achieve in the early days of WWE.Bobby Heenan’s nickname, “The Brain,” wasn’t just for show. Heenan expertly manipulated situations to favor his clients, which included legends like Andre the Giant, Rick Rude, and Mr. Perfect. His managerial stable, The Heenan Family, was one of the most formidable forces in WWE. Whether distracting referees or cutting razor-sharp promos, Heenan's contributions to WWE’s golden era remain unmatched.Known for his trademark megaphone and flashy jackets, Jimmy Hart was a relentless force during WWE’s 1980s boom. Hart managed multiple iconic acts like the Hart Foundation, Honky Tonk Man, and Money Inc. His ability to generate heat for heels and occasionally pivot to managing babyfaces like Hulk Hogan showcased his versatile brilliance.Paul Heyman has continuously reinvented himself across eras, managing champions like Brock Lesnar, CM Punk, and Roman Reigns. Heyman’s deep understanding of storytelling and character work has made him a genius strategist. His alliances with Roman Reigns and Seth Rollins have further solidified his reputation as perhaps the smartest man behind the mic in WWE history.While wrestlers often get the spotlight, these managers played just as important a role in WWE’s success stories. They crafted narratives, enhanced performances, and created unforgettable moments that still resonate with fans today. As WWE evolves, the legacy of these iconic managers continues to inspire a new generation of characters looking to make their mark both inside and outside the ring.","The top five managers in wwe history are: paul bearer, bobby heenan, freddie blassie, jimmy hart, and paul heyman.

Damian Lillard's injury casts a shadow over Milwaukee Bucks' playoff hopes

During Game 4 against Indiana Pacers Damian Lillard suffered an ankle injury to his left ankle which forced him to leave the match due to a potential serious medical concern. The Bucks face severe danger in the playoffs with a 3-1 deficit in the series after their loss made them fall to 2-1. The team along with its supporters awaits the results of Lillard's MRI while staying alert about a crucial postseason change.During Game 4 of the 2025 NBA Playoffs Milwaukee Bucks star Damian Lillard sustained an ankle injury to his left foot shortly after the first quarter started versus Indiana Pacers. Lillard experienced unbearable pain by holding his leg as medical staff had to help him off the court before he lost the ability to stand on his left foot. The Bucks team doctors announced Lillard's absence from the game which medical examinations suggested damages to his Achilles tendon. The evaluation of Lillard's injury will be performed through an MRI scan to identify its severity.This is a real tough break for Lillard, who had only just made his comeback after being diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis in his right calf in March. That kept him out for the end of the regular season, but he was finally cleared to play right before the playoffs kicked off. His return in Game 2 was a big deal, showing he could overcome challenges, but now this new injury has everyone worried about his health and the Bucks' shot at the championship.After Lillard left the game, the Bucks had a tough time keeping their energy up. Giannis Antetokounmpo was the standout with 28 points and 15 rebounds, but without Lillard, their offense just didn't have the same fire. The Pacers took full advantage, with Myles Turner putting up 23 points and Tyrese Haliburton adding 17 points, 15 assists, and 8 rebounds. Indiana shot better than 60% from the field and kept a solid lead the whole game, finishing with a 129-103 win.""This is a tough one, honestly. Blood clot, followed by [Achilles]. ... He's just a great freakin' dude, as a teammate and a father. No one deserves it.""

In red-hot form, Gujarat Titans will look to tighten their grip on the top spot and edge closer to a playoff berth when they face Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League on Monday. Perched atop the 10-team table with six wins from eight matches, the Shubman Gill-led Titans require just two more victories to seal qualification.Functioning like a well-oiled machine, Gujarat have lost only twice this season. Sai Sudharsan and Prasidh Krishna have been standout performers, leading the Orange and Purple Cap races, respectively. Gill, Sudharsan, and Jos Buttler have each amassed over 300 runs at strike rates exceeding 150, showcasing consistency and firepower.Despite Kagiso Rabada’s early departure, Gujarat’s bowling has flourished. Prasidh has claimed 16 wickets at a stunning average of 14.12, while Mohammed Siraj and R Sai Kishore have picked up 12 wickets each, providing crucial breakthroughs.In stark contrast, Rajasthan Royals are almost out of the playoffs race following a narrow loss to Royal Challengers Bengaluru. With five consecutive defeats, the Royals are ninth on the table. While Yashasvi Jaiswal, Riyan Parag, and Nitish Rana have shown promise, their bowling failures have left them playing for pride in their remaining games.The Royals have lost both their home matches so far — by nine wickets against RCB and by two runs against LSG. At the Sawai Mansingh Stadium , the square boundaries measure 67m and 63m, with a straight boundary of 73m. The pitch offers an even covering of grass, suggesting good pace and bounce for the fast bowlers. However, with a few bare patches and a hot day ahead, the surface is expected to be dry.

NEW DELHI: Former India cricketer Ajay Jadeja has attributed Chennai Super Kings ' dismal IPL 2025 campaign to their failure at last year’s auction, calling it the starting point of their sharp decline.Also visit: IPL Live Score Speaking during a JioStar Expert interaction, Jadeja, a self-proclaimed fan of both CSK and Mumbai Indians , reflected on the franchise's emotional high in 2024 after their 2023 title win.""The last one was probably more emotional. Sometimes when you win, you stick to the same players, hoping it’ll happen again. But there was a curve that was heading down,"" Jadeja remarked.Pointing directly at the auction strategy, Jadeja said, ""I think that the auction was where you could see that they did not have the firepower most other teams acquired. That was probably the key to start with. Naturally, when things don't go well, you lose.""CSK, known for backing their players through rough patches, have appeared uncharacteristically unsettled this season with frequent changes to their playing XI - a departure from their tried-and-tested formula. Jadeja highlighted this shift, referencing the franchise’s past faith in players like Shane Watson.""Chennai would stick. Watson struggled all the way to the final, but he still played all the games. This year, Conway came for three games, Rachin is now out. So that is something new. Maybe because of the uncertainty at the auction, this is what we are seeing,"" he explained.With CSK languishing at the bottom of the points table, Jadeja’s words strike at the heart of their struggles.","Former india cricketer ajay jadeja has attributed chennai super kings'dismal ipl 2025 campaign to their failure at last year’s auction.
