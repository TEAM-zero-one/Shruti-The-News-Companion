Why the Milwaukee Bucks Consider It

Risks for Both Sides

Could thepull off a massive trade to pair Luka Dončić with? After a disappointing playoff exit, the Lakers are exploring bold moves to rebuild their championship-contending roster. One potential blockbuster deal could bring the two-time MVP to Los Angeles, reshaping the NBA landscape.The Los Angeles Lakers’ early playoff departure at the hands of the Minnesota Timberwolves has forced the front office into a critical offseason. With Luka Dončić’s future uncertain beyond next season and LeBron James nearing retirement, general manager Rob Pelinka faces tough decisions.The team must choose between:- Building depth around Dončić and James.- Swinging for a third superstar to form a historic trio.A proposed trade by Colby Faria of the Sporting News could deliver Giannis Antetokounmpo, giving the Los Angeles Lakers one of the most dominant duos in NBA history.Here’s how the deal could work:- Instant Championship Window: Pairing Dončić and Giannis Antetokounmpo would create an unstoppable pick-and-roll duo.- LeBron’s Last Ride: James may delay retirement for a shot at a fifth title.- Long-Term Star Power: Secures a future cornerstone if Dončić stays.- Draft Capital: Multiple unprotected picks offer flexibility for a rebuild.- Young Talent: Reaves and Knecht provide immediate contributors.- Financial Relief: Moves off Giannis’ supermax for future flexibility.While the trade is enticing, there are potential pitfalls:- For the Lakers: If the gamble fails, Dončić could leave in 2026, leaving the team in a full rebuild.- For the Bucks: Trading a franchise icon risks alienating fans unless the return yields future success.As analyst Colby Faria noted: ""If Giannis Antetokounmpo ended up with the Lakers, it would create one of the most talented duos in NBA history between he and Luka Dončić.""Also read: NBA Trade Rumors: Golden State Warriors could eye $70 million Boston Celtics point guard to boster squad after unfortunate playoff exit The Lakers’ front office must weigh short-term glory against long-term stability.

His poor shot selection in such a crucial game only amplified the backlash.While Pant flopped once again, Mitchell Marsh (65) and Aiden Markram (61) had given SRH a flying start, hammering the LSG bowlers in the powerplay.Despite efforts from Nicholas Pooran (45) to push the total beyond 200, LSG's momentum dipped sharply in the middle overs.With the playoff race heating up, every decision and every dismissal carries weight.

Jayson Tatum's Injury and Financial Constraints Prompt Potential Roster Overhaul

The Boston Celtics are said to be contemplating a trade involving Derrick White , a crucial player in their recent title run. This comes shortly after Jayson Tatum's unfortunate Achilles injury, which has put the team's future in jeopardy. Although White has been a key asset, recognized with an All-Defensive Second Team selection and a four-year, $125.9 million extension signed in July 2024, the Celtics are exploring various strategies to address their financial challenges and remain competitive.The Boston Celtics just got knocked out of the playoffs, and with Tatum hurt, they're taking a hard look at their lineup. They've got a hefty salary cap situation, especially with Tatum's massive contract, which makes things tricky. Word is, Jrue Holiday and Kristaps Porzingis might be up for trade too, but White's age and contract make him a more likely candidate to be moved.Derrick White's time with the Celtics has been filled with major milestones. He was key in their championship win in 2024, making important contributions on both ends of the court. His playoff stats, averaging 16.7 points per game, highlighted how valuable he is to the squad. Still, with the Celtics investing heavily in Tatum, Brown, and others, discussions about extending White's contract have gotten a bit tricky.There's a buzz around trade rumors, especially with the Pistons and Warriors in the mix. The Pistons are eyeing a deal that could involve Jaden Ivey and some draft picks, and the Warriors are keen if the Celtics start making big changes. This indicates the Celtics are open to all possibilities for reworking their lineup.Although there's a lot of talk, some analysts argue that letting go of White might not be the best call for the team. His defensive skills and leadership are crucial to the Celtics' identity. However, the financial situation and the need for salary cap space might lead to some hard decisions.Also Read: Nikola Jokic told Aaron Gordon to sit out, but the forward battled through a hamstring injury in Game 7 defeat The Boston Celtics are at a pivotal point, with Derrick White's future uncertain.

Aaron Rodgers to Steelers a done deal already? The man who wrote veteran QB's story thinks it’s very possible,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/aaron-rodgers-to-steelers-a-done-deal-already-the-man-who-wrote-veteran-qbs-story-thinks-its-very-possible/articleshow/121252339.cms,"Aaron Rodgers’ biographer believes the legendary quarterback could soon join the Pittsburgh Steelers, sparking major buzz and speculation across the NFL. (Credit: Getty Images)

Insider who penned Aaron Rodgers’ life says Pittsburgh could soon land the legendary QB



The Pittsburgh Steelers might be on the cusp of one of the most fascinating quarterback acquisitions in recent NFL memory. As the Aaron Rodgers saga unfolds, fans and insiders alike are bracing for what could be a transformative chapter in both the franchise's future and Rodgers' storied career. According to Out of the Darkness author Ian O’Connor—Rodgers' biographer and longtime friend—there’s a strong belief that a deal is imminent, and it could all culminate before the start of the Steelers’ mandatory minicamp.“I do think there will be a happy ending, at least for him and we will find out for the Steelers and their fan base,” O'Connor shared in a recent appearance on 93.7 The Fan. “If I had $100 to put down, my feeling is he will be in uniform June 10th, for the start of the mandatory minicamp.”O’Connor’s insights carry weight. He interviewed more than 250 individuals for his 2024 biography on Rodgers and maintains close ties with the quarterback. His conviction about the move isn’t rooted in guesswork—it's shaped by Rodgers’ own behind-the-scenes messaging to Pittsburgh. O’Connor mentioned that Rodgers has signaled his intent to play for the Steelers but has been delaying the official move due to unresolved personal matters.“He’s told [the Steelers], ‘Listen, I’m gonna play for you. I just don’t want to go there and then miss part of mandatory minicamp because of my personal issues. I’m pretty sure they’re gonna be solved by the end of May, at least in my satisfaction where I can give you my all,’” O’Connor explained.These personal issues, which Rodgers acknowledged in his only public remarks this offseason, reportedly involve someone close to him. While O’Connor opted not to reveal specifics, he clarified, “The sense I got was, I think I have a pretty good sense of what it is, and I don’t think it’s something that would prevent him from playing football.”From a football standpoint, Rodgers would be a clear upgrade for the Steelers, especially over Mason Rudolph. While Pittsburgh’s offense may not be overflowing with elite talent, Rodgers is the type of quarterback who can elevate the players around him. With weapons like DK Metcalf, Pat Freiermuth, Calvin Austin, and Robert Woods, the veteran’s presence could unlock a new dimension for the Steelers’ attack.O'Connor is optimistic—not just about the fit, but about the outcome. “Do I think the Steelers are going to win the Super Bowl? No, but if you told me 11-6 with at least one playoff victory, the first with that franchise since 2016, I think that's realistic. I think that this could be a success story, and certainly a worthy ending for him.”For Rodgers, a move to Pittsburgh wouldn’t just be about chasing a Super Bowl. It would be about redemption. His brief, injury-marred stint with the Jets was widely viewed as a disappointment. “He knows it was an embarrassment in New York largely, and he’s the face of that embarrassment,” O’Connor said. A strong run in Pittsburgh could rewrite the narrative and offer Rodgers a satisfying final act—one that proves Act II wasn’t his final bow.With OTAs set to begin in just over a week and the 2025 NFL schedule now revealed, timing seems to be aligning perfectly. If the deal materializes, expect a press conference in Pittsburgh soon—ushering in what might be Rodgers' last, and potentially most poetic, NFL chapter.Also Read: Eagles star calls Ivanka Trump “beautiful,” and she responds with a special locker room message","Ian o'connor, aaron rodgers' biographer, says a deal could soon be done.

'Chances are still there': Abishek Porel believes in IPL 2025 playoff miracle

NEW DELHI: The IPL 2025 showdown between Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) lit up with drama as tensions boiled over between spinner Digvesh Rathi and SRH opener Abhishek Sharma during the eighth over of a pulsating run chase.The flashpoint came when Rathi dismissed a blazing Abhishek, who had hammered 59 off just 20 balls in a ferocious assault on the LSG bowlers. Attempting to launch a wide googly over the off-side, Abhishek mistimed the shot and sliced it to sweeper cover, where Shardul Thakur held onto a sharp running catch.What should have been a moment of triumph quickly turned confrontational.Rathi, known for his flamboyant ""book-sign"" celebration, unleashed it once more after the crucial breakthrough. However, the gesture didn’t sit well with Abhishek. Visibly agitated, the southpaw exchanged heated words with Rathi, prompting the umpires and teammates to intervene and cool tempers.In a video that quickly went viral, Abhishek can be seen mouthing to Rathi while walking back to the pavilion: “Teri choti pakad ke marunga” — “I'll grab your braid and beat you up.”At the time of the dismissal, SRH were flying high at 99 runs, seemingly on course to chase down LSG’s formidable 205-run total. Abhishek’s fiery innings, studded with four boundaries and six massive sixes, had given Hyderabad the perfect launchpad.Earlier in the contest, Mitchell Marsh (65) and Aiden Markram (61) laid a solid foundation for LSG with explosive half-centuries. The innings stuttered in the middle overs after skipper Rishabh Pant ’s departure for just 7, but Nicholas Pooran’s late fireworks — a 45-run blitz off 26 balls — propelled LSG past the 200-run mark.While the match had its fair share of fireworks, it was the Abhishek-Rathi spat that grabbed the spotlight. Fans flooded social media with reactions and clips, turning the heated exchange into one of the most talked-about moments of the IPL season.","Lucknow super giants (lsg) and sunrisers hyderabad (srh) clashed in ipl 2025.

A respectful goodbye to Paul Mullin by Wrexham co-owner

Thoughtful send-off by Ryan Reynolds

Paul Mullin's legacy continues

With the club now preparing for its inaugural season in the Championship, co-owner Ryan Reynolds is reported to be considering a farewell for one of the club's leading player, Paul Mullin. Having been so instrumental in Wrexham's back-to-back promotions, Mullin has elevated beyond the goal scorer tag and into a symbol of the team's metamorphosis and a supporter favourite. Rumours of an exit have gained momentum, and Reynolds is now expected to give a gesture that displays the club's and owners' deep respect for him.It seems like the end of an emotional journey for Mullin in Wrexham. Despite having a contract till 2026, changes in the squad and non-considerable appearances have stirred the waters for a potential summer departure.Sources close to the club hold that Wrexham might allow Mullin to move on without demanding anything for a transfer - an act of respect and goodwill rather than business. Few players have shaped the club so dramatically in recent times, particularly after aiding the club out of the National League into League Two and now into the Championship.Ryan Reynolds, known for doing everything from the ground up with players or having a great relationship with them, is said to have planned a tribute to Paul Mullin for his contributions. Of course, the details remain under wraps, but it is clear that Reynolds wants to give Mullins proper recognition for his contribution on and off the pitch.This is not the first time Reynolds has gone out of his way in trying to honour the club's own, and it is an endorsement of how deeply he and co-owner Rob McElhenney have gotten themselves into Wrexham.Arriving at Wrexham in 2021, Paul Mullin soon became the heart of the team's attacking line. His goalscoring records and tireless efforts kept Wrexham's climb upward, whereas his influence was much larger than that. Mullin was known for issues beyond football, including speaking out on social matters like autism awareness since his son is on the spectrum. Mullin became one of the speakers for the community.Also Read: Vegas party over: Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney axe 8 Wrexham players days after lavish promotion bash With the club already set to face a new challenge in the Championship, Mullin's legacies are already secured.

Mariners use Giancarlo Stanton's skills to end drought of not appearing in World Series

Giancarlo Stanton has been a name in the homes of baseball fans for years. But now, while recovering from injuries in 2025, rumors are spreading that the New York Yankees will trade him. A possible new destination? The Seattle Mariners. With prospects rising in New York, Stanton may no longer be required. But for a team like the Mariners, who are looking for a strong playoff push, Stanton's power at the plate would be the game-changer.Giancarlo Stanton has not appeared in a game thus far in 2025 due to both elbows being hurt. Meanwhile, Ben Rice has stepped in and played wonderful baseball. Along with other stars like Aaron Judge and Jason Dominguez, Rice has kept the Yankees on top. With so much youth talent, the Yankees might decide to say goodbye to Stanton.Giancarlo Stanton was the Yankees' top slugger at one time. He joined the Yankees in 2018 and immediately established an MLB record for the most difficult home run ever hit at 121.7 mph. That record still stands today. Being healthy, however, has not been a cakewalk.As Zachary Howell of Clutch Points informs us, it's unlikely Stanton can ever play for a complete season again. But even so, according to Howell, Stanton has some value, especially for a team that wants power in the playoffs.The Seattle Mariners are one of the few MLB teams never to have appeared in the World Series. Adding a large bat-like Stanton's would give their offense the boost that it needs so desperately. Even though Stanton was injured, he's a power hitter when he's not injured. Last year when the Yankees made their playoff run, he was among their best players.Giancarlo Stanton had played for the Miami Marlins. He also won the MVP award. If they trade for him, the Mariners will be acquiring a player with this much experience and playoff strength, something that they greatly lack.Also Read: Who Is Cody Bellinger’s Wife Chase Carter's Ex-Boyfriend Giancarlo Stanton?","Giancarlo stanton has not appeared in a game thus far in 2025 due to both elbows being hurt.

Why the NHL never wanted Wayne Gretzky's son Ty Gretzky— even with the name,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/why-the-nhl-never-wanted-wayne-gretzkys-son-ty-gretzky-even-with-the-name/articleshow/121215015.cms,"Despite the name, NHL teams didn’t take the bait on Ty Gretzky (Image via Instagram)

The pressure of legacy proved more burden than boost

Despite the name, NHL teams didn’t take the bait

When your father is arguably the greatest hockey player of all time, the expectations aren’t just high — they’re suffocating. For Ty Gretzky , the eldest son of NHL icon Wayne Gretzky , the pressure to live up to ""The Great One"" was never just on the ice. It followed him into every locker room, every interview, and every shift he played. But despite his last name carrying the weight of a sports empire, Ty never came close to donning an NHL jersey — and few seem to talk about why.Ty Gretzky laced up his skates with the same passion many young Canadians do. But unlike most, his every move was scrutinized. Coaches, scouts, and fans often judged him not as a young player with potential, but as Wayne Gretzky’s son — a comparison no teenager could realistically live up to. As a result, Ty’s hockey development took place in the long shadow of a living legend, which may have stunted rather than supported his path.It’s easy to assume that Ty would get a shot at the NHL just based on the marketing potential alone. But the league never called — not even for a low-risk camp invite. And that raises a question the hockey world tends to avoid: did NHL executives quietly agree he simply didn’t have the talent, or were they wary of the media circus that would follow?While Ty played briefly in junior leagues, including a stint with the Shattuck-St. Mary’s prep school — a pipeline for future pros — his performances were modest. There were no breakout seasons, no jaw-dropping stats. Scouts remained silent. Teams passed him over year after year.Unlike other sports where legacy can open doors, the NHL prides itself on merit. Nepotism rarely flies in a league where every inch of ice is earned. In that sense, Ty Gretzky may be a rare case: the son of greatness who couldn’t buy his way into the league — even if others in his shoes might have tried.Also Read: Wayne Gretzky's son Ty Gretzky shows favouritism, backs Rick Tocchet's return as Flyers head coach with enthusiastic message In the end, Ty chose his own path, leaving hockey behind to pursue entrepreneurship and media. But the question still lingers: did the NHL ignore Ty because he wasn’t good enough — or because he was too much of a Gretzky?","Despite the name, nhl teams didn’t take the bait on ty gretzky. Despite his last name carrying the weight of a sports empire, ty never came close to donning an nhl jersey. Ty chose his own path, leaving hockey behind to pursue entrepreneurship and media.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121216437,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-98540,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

After weeks of stirring performances and highly charged moments, American Idol has finally crowned its Season 23 winner. On the evening of May 18, the crown was given to Jamal Roberts , a physical education teacher from Meridian, Mississippi. Roberts won the series finale against fellow finalists John Foster and Breanna Nix, who finished second and third, respectively.The news was delivered by veteran host Ryan Seacrest in one of the most emotional moments of the season. However, Jamal's win is about so much more than singing ability. It is a testament to determination, core values, and a quest to make a difference.American Idol 2025 has named its season 23 winner, Jamal Roberts. Familiar for his rich vocals and compelling background, Roberts had audiences spellbound throughout the season. From Meridian, Mississippi, his path not only demonstrated his ability but his commitment to family, community, and having a positive influence. Prior to his American Idol experience, Roberts had already seen the competitive landscape of television performance. He already made it to the Top 3 on BET's Sunday Best, a gospel music show that prepared him with the grit he would need on the larger national stage.""Sunday Best taught me to persevere when the heat is on,"" Roberts revealed in a backstage interview. ""It gave me tough skin, and that was a real prep for Idol.""That preparation served her well over the course of the season, as Roberts consistently delivered emotionally powerful performances that both impressed the judges and won the hearts of the public.Roberts' attachment to his hometown of Meridian, Mississippi was a constant theme during his American Idol experience. When he auditioned for the first time, he openly discussed the issues in his community, such as crime and economic struggle. But instead of focusing on hardship, he decided to be a hope provider.""This is where I grew up,"" he said. ""It can be a whole lot better than it is. So, I'm praying that I can bring a little light to it.""That spotlight, Roberts feels, starts in the house. A devoted father to three daughters—Harmoni, Lyrik, and Gianna—his drive to succeed was as much personal as it was professional. His youngest daughter, Gianna, was born a few days before a live show taping in Los Angeles. While the emotional sacrifice of being apart from his family was significant, their encouragement remained his push. They've been with me through it all,"" he said. ""I drew strength from seeing their faces in the crowd every time I went on stage.""What distinguishes Jamal Roberts is not merely his voice talent—it's the message in the music. As a schoolteacher, father, and community leader, Roberts represents a new breed of artist: one who harnesses their platform for the purpose of inspiring others and sparking useful conversation.During the competition, his narrative struck a chord across the country. He was not only a performer to audiences, but a man who was genuinely passionate about his principles—someone capable of reconciling ambition and humility.""Jamal is the type of artist the world needs today,"" one judge said during the final. ""His voice speaks to the heart, but his story speaks to life.""With Season 23 of American Idol now over, fans are looking to see what the future holds for Roberts. His victory paves the way for recording contracts, national tours, and other music industry opportunities. However, Roberts stays true to himself. ""I want to use this moment to show my students and my daughters that dreams really can come true,"" he said. ""But it takes faith, work, and a whole lot of heart.""National fame is not all that Roberts will gain, however. In addition to his newfound celebrity status, he will also get a cash prize of $125,000, according to the reports. Though the money is a big incentive, it's apparent that to Jamal Roberts, the real reward is the potential to influence and touch lives.","Jamal roberts, a physical education teacher from meridian, mississippi, was crowned season 23 winner on may 18.

'Shubman Gill used his brains a lot more than the other guys'

NEW DELHI: Chennai Super Kings head coach Stephen Fleming finally addressed the elephant in the room, MS Dhoni ’s IPL future, but gave little away.""I don’t know,"" said Fleming during the pre-match press conference at the Arun Jaitley Stadium on Monday, leaving fans and pundits guessing about whether the 43-year-old legendary captain has played his final IPL season.As Chennai Super Kings prepare to face Rajasthan Royals in their final match of the IPL 2025 season, the focus has shifted from results to rebuilding.It’s been a season to forget for the five-time champions, marred by inconsistency and underwhelming performances across departments.However, amid the disappointment, silver linings have emerged: none brighter than 17-year-old Ayush Mhatre.The young opener’s fearless approach and ability to score quickly in the powerplay have given CSK hope for the future.With Mhatre, along with Dewald Brevis, Urvil Patel, and Shaik Rasheed stepping up, CSK are beginning to look ahead, possibly to a post-Dhoni era, one still not officially confirmed yet.The match at the Arun Jaitley Stadium, a neutral venue per the revised schedule, gives these youngsters one more chance to stake their claim.On the other hand, Rajasthan Royals are limping toward the finish line.Despite boasting talent like Yashasvi Jaiswal and promising youngster Vaibhav Suryavanshi, RR's campaign has collapsed under poor decisions, particularly in last year's auction.Letting go of Jos Buttler and banking heavily on unproven Indian talent, combined with the lack of a frontline Indian bowler or a dependable all-rounder, has cost them dearly.With only one win while chasing in nine attempts, Rajasthan’s failure to finish games has become their defining trait this season.Both teams may be out of contention, but for CSK, the focus is firmly on what lies ahead, with or without MS Dhoni.","Chennai super kings prepare to face rajasthan royals in their final match of the ipl 2025 season.

Bombay Sport Exchange Ep 5: Shane Watson on how IPL gave him a lifeline & his tribute to Phil Hughes

NEW DELHI: In a surprising turn of events, the public spat between singer Rahul Vaidya and cricket icon Virat Kohli may finally have reached a peaceful resolution. Vaidya, who made headlines after calling Kohli a “joker” and mocking the cricketer’s social media activity, recently revealed that Kohli has unblocked him on Instagram.Taking to his Instagram stories, Vaidya expressed gratitude toward the former India captain, writing, “Thank you @virat.kohli for unblocking me... you are one of the best batsmen cricket has ever seen and Aap India ka garv ho! Jai Hind. God bless you and your family.”This seemingly marks the end of a digital feud that had spiralled out of control just days earlier.The drama began when Kohli’s account liked a photo of actress and influencer Avneet Kaur, a move that Vaidya sarcastically questioned online. Kohli later issued a clarification, attributing the like to Instagram’s algorithm.Vaidya wasn’t convinced and responded with a mocking video, poking fun at the explanation and warning his followers about algorithm-driven mistakes.Things took a sharp turn when Kohli allegedly blocked Vaidya on Instagram. In response, the singer called Kohli a “joker” and later posted inflammatory remarks about the cricketer’s fans after they began targeting his wife and sister with online abuse.“I’m a fan of Virat’s cricket, but the personal attacks on my family crossed the line,” Vaidya said in one of his follow-up posts, standing by his original comment but denouncing the online hate.Now, with Kohli unblocking him, Vaidya appears ready to move on. His latest message strikes a far more respectful tone, praising Kohli’s achievements and patriotic spirit. Whether this digital détente leads to a real reconciliation remains to be seen, but for now, the war of words seems to be cooling off.",Virat kohli unblocked singer rahul vaidya on instagram.

IPL: Sunil Joshi hails Harpreet Brar’s impact as Punjab Kings down Rajasthan Royals

NEW DELHI: Former champions Gujarat Titans stormed into the IPL 2025 playoffs in style, registering a dominant 10-wicket victory over Delhi Capitals on Sunday. Skipper Shubman Gill and opener Sai Sudharsan starred with the bat in a flawless run chase, as GT hunted down DC’s target of 200 with six balls to spare.Sudharsan blazed his way to a 61-ball unbeaten 108, while Gill remained unbeaten on a composed 93 off 53 deliveries. The two stitched together a record opening stand and ensured Gujarat’s place in the knockouts with two league matches still to play.“Feels great to get the Q (qualification), but still two important games left. Carrying momentum is important. I've talked about being a batter, think as one without worrying about captaincy,” said Gill at the post-match presentation.Reflecting on his captaincy journey, Gill admitted to early struggles in the role but said he has since learned how to handle the pressure.“Found it (captaincy) challenging last year, learnt how to manage it late in the season. Our fielding had been below par, we'd dropped a lot of catches, we reflected on that and worked on it during the break,” he said.Gill also credited his calm approach at the crease to a conscious decision to separate captaincy from batting responsibilities.“When you're in form, someone like Sai who's converting starts, you don't talk much. You just talk about what's required. When in flow, you just need to make sure you don't get carried away,” he explained.The enforced break due to military tensions between India and Pakistan, Gill said, gave him a chance to recover physically.“I'd gotten sick, the break helped me recover.”Assistant coach Parthiv Patel praised the openers’ approach and mutual understanding, which he believes have been crucial to GT’s success this season.“We've batted and played really well throughout, going into the playoffs is a reward for how well we've done. Openers play low-risk cricket, still they have the ability to hit down the ground and find boundaries.""The fours they hit during the game especially. They know their game, they put a lot of work in strengthening their basics which shows. They communicate well, last year they batted brilliantly.""Opening pair is about chemistry and knowing each other's games well which they do.""Parthiv also credited head coach Ashish Nehra ’s leadership for the team’s consistency and strong standing on the points table.“He's been fantastic and is the reason why we're right up there,” he said.Player of the match Sudharsan, now the leading run-scorer of the season alongside Gill (609 and 594 runs respectively), said staying mentally composed was key to chasing down a daunting total.“We took the game deep, were cool enough mentally and got 2-3 big overs after 12, which worked out. Had taken risks in earlier games which hadn't worked out. I've also started to believe myself more to take the game deeper, expand my game.""Not much has changed with my batting, but mentally I'm more free and expressive. Maybe I can get better at striking against spin and improving my batting after the 15th over.""On his partnership with Gill, Sudharsan highlighted the strong rapport they’ve built over time.“There's a lot of understanding. We complement each other especially when the other batter is doing well, running is a vital thing too,” he said.",Gujarat titans qualify for ipl 2025 playoffs with 10-wicket victory over delhi capitals.

'Chances are still there': Abishek Porel believes in IPL 2025 playoff miracle

MUMBAI: When the Indian team is picked for the Bangladesh tour, which includes three ODIs and as many T20Is, in August, KL Rahul 's name is set to be considered for the T20Is as well. It has been almost two-and-a-half-years since Rahul played the last of his 72 T20Is for India.On November 10 in the semifinals of the T20 World Cup against England, Rahul, opening the innings with skipper Rohit Sharma, was dismissed by Chris Woakes for a five-ball five as India suffered a humiliating 10-wicket thrashing to exit the tournament.Having made just 128 runs in six matches at an average of 21.33 and strike rate of 120.75, Rahul had forced the selectors that India needed to look beyond him in the game's shortest format.However, in the last six months, Rahul has given every reason to convince the ""five wise men"" in Indian cricket that it's time to hand him a return ticket in T20Is.On Sunday night at the Arun Jaitley Stadium during a league match of IPL 2025, Rahul was at his majestic best, hitting one imperious shot after another, as he stroked a sublime unbeaten 112 off just 65 balls, which included 14 fours and four sixes, for the Delhi Capitals against Gujarat Titans.With Sai Sudharshan and Shubman Gill firing all guns against a mediocre DC bowling, Rahul's effort, which had helped DC get to 199 for three in 20 overs, got overshadowed.Yet, Rahul has been in sensational form in IPL 2025.During his blazing knock, Rahul became faster than greats like Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma to score 8,000 runs in T20 cricket, achieving the feat in just 224 innings (237 matches).In 11 matches so far in IPL 2025, the 33-year-old 'keeper-batter has scored 493 runs off just 333 balls, with three fifties and a hundred, his strike rate being a healthy 148.04.More importantly, if he keeps batting like this, Rahul is definitely in the fray for a spot in the 2026 T20 World Cup in India and Sri Lanka in February-March next year.When the tournament began, Rahul batted at No. 4 in the team's interest, but moved to the opening slot when the IPL resumed for the franchise on Sunday, as Australian's Jake Fraser-McGurk didn't return for the rest of the tournament.He had entered the IPL after scoring 140 runs in 143 balls at an ""unreal"" average of 140 in five matches, with the team winning the 2025 Champions Trophy in UAE.","Kl rahul has scored 493 runs off just 333 balls, with three fifties and a hundred.

Greenstone Lobo predicts Virat Kohli & Rohit Sharma's ODI future

NEW DELHI: The IPL 2025 match between Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) and Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH) witnessed a fiery moment as tempers flared between spinner Digvesh Rathi and SRH batter Abhishek Sharma in the 8th over of the innings.The dramatic incident occurred when Rathi dismissed a red-hot Abhishek Sharma for a blistering 59 off just 20 balls.Sharma, who had been toying with the bowlers, looked to launch a wide googly over the off-side but ended up slicing it to sweeper cover, where Shardul Thakur took a sharp running catch.What should’ve been a moment of celebration quickly turned tense.Rathi, known for his signature “book-sign” celebration, pulled it out once again after getting the breakthrough.But this time, it didn’t sit well with Sharma. The southpaw appeared visibly agitated and exchanged heated words with the bowler before umpires and teammates quickly stepped in to defuse the situation.Watch:At the time of Sharma's dismissal, SRH were cruising at 99 runs, looking set to chase down LSG’s challenging 205-run target.

However, the middle overs dragged down their momentum, especially after the dismissal of skipper Rishabh Pant for just 7. Nicholas Pooran’s late blitz (45 off 26) pushed them past the 200-run mark.Despite the on-field tension, fans were buzzing over the Sharma-Rathi face-off, with clips of the altercation going viral online.
