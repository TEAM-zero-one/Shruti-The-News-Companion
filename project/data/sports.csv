Poll Do you think PM Modi's comparison of cricket to Operation Sindoor was appropriate? Yes, it was an appropriate analogy No, it was inappropriate

NEW DELHI: A day after the Indian cricket team won the Asia Cup Championship, political row erupted over PM Modi 's congratulatory remarks, with Congress terming the Operation Sindoor mention ""inappropriate"".Soon after the win, PM Modi posted on X last night saying, ""#OperationSindoor on the games field. Outcome is the same - India wins! Congrats to our cricketers.""The post drew flak from Congress, with Pawan Khera writing a direct post to PM Modi saying, ""Prime Minister, firstly, comparing a cricket match to a battlefield is not appropriate."" Further taking a jibe at the PM and indirectly hinting at Trump's repeated ceasefire claims, Khera added, ""Secondly, if you must make such a comparison, you need to learn from the Indian team that when you’re close to victory, good captains don’t call for a ceasefire just because a third umpire says so. ""This was the latest in series of back and forth among politicians. Earlier in the day, other Congress leaders had also taken jabs at the Prime minister. """"Sometimes I doubt if PM Modi has any knowledge of foreign policy and diplomacy. If we played, we should have played with sportsman spirit,"" Atul Londhe Patil told news agency PTI. """"If Operation Sindoor is ongoing, then we shouldn't have played. And if discussions are ongoing to normalise the situation, then sports can be a medium to improve it, but linking everything with Operation Sindoor is not right,"" Patil added.Maharashtra Congress president Harshvardhan Sakpal also reacted to the Prime Minister’s post. He said: “It is clear from his tweet that, be it air, water, or sports, he brings politics into everything to polarise. We take pride in India’s victory, but we haven't won the Asia Cup for the first time. There is a certain dignity of a country which he doesn't maintain, and I regret this.”Shiv Sena (UBT) MP Priyanka Chaturvedi has criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for linking India’s Asia Cup victory over Pakistan with Operation Sindoor, warning that tournament proceeds could be diverted to fund terror activities across the border. Speaking to ANI, Chaturvedi had said that the Asia Cup games between India and Pakistan “should not have happened” in the first place, questioning why India chose to play Pakistan despite its stated “zero tolerance for terror” policy. “In the first place, this match should not have happened. The cricket match that BCCI played for the benefit of PCB... the match that took place for the revenue of the broadcasters. The 140 crore people of the country did not want this match to happen,"" she added.Also read: Congress slams PM Modi's post after India's Asia Cup win; row over playing match On the other hand, BJP had also taken jabs at Congress for not making a statement on India's win.

NEW DELHI: In a strikingly worded message early Monday, Prime Minister Narendra Modi hailed Team India ’s Asia Cup triumph over Pakistan , just minutes after result of finals, invoking “Operation Sindoor” to frame the win as a moment of national pride.“OperationSindoor on the games field.

Antonio Brown claims Jay-Z controls the halftime stage



Bad Bunny frames the performance as a cultural victory

The balance of power and purpose at the NFL’s biggest stage

The NFL ’s announcement that Bad Bunny will headline the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show has sparked excitement across music and sports. But while fans celebrate the Puerto Rican superstar’s historic booking, former NFL wide receiver Antonio Brown is questioning how these selections are actually made—and pointing directly at Jay-Z.Antonio Brown took to X (formerly Twitter) to allege that Jay-Z, through his company Roc Nation, plays the decisive role in choosing halftime acts. He wrote: ""Barack Obama's best friend Jay-Z runs the Super Bowl selection process through his company Roc Nation which has an exclusive contract with the NFL. This is who chooses the halftime show, the most watched musical performance in America.""His claim adds weight to ongoing discussions about how much power Roc Nation holds in shaping one of the biggest entertainment moments in the world. Since 2019, Jay-Z has officially partnered with the NFL as its “live music entertainment strategist,” and Roc Nation has served as co-producer of halftime productions. Industry insiders, including producer Jesse Collins, have even said: “It’s a decision that Jay makes. Since we’ve been onboard with that show, he’s made it every year, and it’s been amazing. He’s always picked right.”Still, some analysts argue the process involves multiple layers of input, including the NFL, host cities, and broadcast partners.While Jay-Z may not have absolute control, his influence is undeniable.Amid the speculation, Bad Bunny himself is focused less on politics and more on representation. In his statement, he explained: “What I'm feeling goes beyond myself. It's for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown. This is for my people, my culture and our history. Ve y dile a tu abuela, que seremos el HALFTIME SHOW DEL SUPER BOWL.”For him, the halftime stage is not just a career milestone but a chance to highlight Latin culture on one of the most-watched platforms in the world.From Brown’s sharp claims about behind-the-scenes control to Bad Bunny’s emotional emphasis on cultural pride, the halftime show conversation reflects more than just music. It is about power, representation, and identity.Also Read: Is Bad Bunny bringing Latin flair to Apple Music 2026 Super Bowl Halftime Show?

Braelon Allen injury adds to Jets’ offensive concerns



What’s next for Braelon Allen and the Jets



The New York Jets were dealt an early setback on Monday Night Football when running back Braelon Allen exited with a knee injury in the second quarter against the Miami Dolphins. The rookie went down after taking a hard hit during a kickoff return and was quickly escorted to the medical tent before limping to the locker room. Moments later, the Jets officially ruled him out for the rest of the game.Allen’s night had started with promise. Before the injury, he carried the ball four times for 26 yards, showing flashes of power and patience. However, the momentum shifted when he lost a costly fumble at the goal line on New York’s opening drive. “As Braelon Allen ran off the field after the fumble, Aaron Glenn grabbed both sides of his helmet to console him and give him words of encouragement,” sideline reporter Katie George noted during the ESPN broadcast.The emotional toll was clear. “Allen then spent a lot of time pacing, sitting and standing alone. He was obviously gutted to lose the ball at the goal line. Now, he’s in some physical pain, as they look at his left knee in the injury tent,” George added.For the Jets, Allen’s absence leaves the backfield thinner than planned. With Breece Hall already carrying the bulk of the offense, Isaiah Davis is now expected to step into a larger role.The team will need both to stay sharp if they hope to keep pace in the AFC East.The concern now extends beyond Week 4. A knee injury severe enough to sideline Allen immediately raises questions about his availability moving forward. In the first three games of the season, the 20-year-old logged 14 carries for 50 yards and a touchdown, carving out a role behind Hall.The Jets will await further testing to determine the severity of the injury. Losing Allen for an extended stretch would not only hurt New York’s depth but also slow the development of a rookie who was beginning to find his rhythm in the league.Also Read: Jake Browning’s fiancée Stephanie Niles turns heads with her unusual Bengals look ahead of Broncos clash",New york jets running back braelon allen suffered a knee injury in the second quarter.

Poll Do you think India should have accepted the trophy from Mohsin Naqvi? Yes, it was just a formality No, a neutral official should present it

A video that surfaced on social media showed Asian Cricket Council (ACC) chief and Pakistan minister Mohsin Naqvi leaving the stadium in protest after India refused to accept the Asia Cup 2025 trophy and winners’ medals from his hands.Naqvi, who is also the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) chief, had waited on the podium for the post-match presentation. However, the Indian team, led by Suryakumar Yadav, refused to receive the trophy or medals, requesting that a neutral official hand them over instead.After discussions failed to resolve the situation, Naqvi walked off the stage. Officials were later seen taking the trophy away from the podium as well. The video brought to light the tense and unexpected moment, which brought the post-match ceremony to a halt.Speaking at the post-match press conference, India captain Suryakumar Yadav expressed disbelief at the incident. “This is one thing which I have never seen since I started playing cricket, started following cricket—a champion team is denied a trophy, that too a hard-earned one,” he said.“I feel we deserved it. And I can't say anything more. If you tell me about trophies, mine are sitting in the dressing room, all 14 guys with me, the support staff—those are the real trophies throughout this journey in the Asia Cup.”The BCCI has decided to lodge a formal protest with the International Cricket Council (ICC) against Naqvi’s actions. Despite the controversy, the Indian players celebrated their historic win on the field, even without the trophy in hand.On the pitch, India clinched clinched the 2025 Asia Cup title with a thrilling five-wicket victory over Pakistan. Riding on Tilak Varma’s unbeaten 69 off 53 balls and a vital 33 from Shivam Dube, India chased down a target of 147 with two balls to spare.Earlier, Pakistan had posted 146 all out in 19.1 overs, despite solid contributions from Sahibzada Farhan (57) and Fakhar Zaman (46). Indian spinners Kuldeep Yadav (4/30), Varun Chakravarthy (2/30), and Axar Patel (2/26) triggered a collapse that saw Pakistan lose their last nine wickets for just 33 runs. Jasprit Bumrah also chipped in with 2/25.This marked India’s third win over Pakistan in this edition of the tournament, following victories in the league and Super Fours stages. While the trophy controversy overshadowed the post-match proceedings, the Indian team’s performance on the field was a clear statement of dominance.","India beat pakistan by five wickets in the 2025 asia cup cricket final.

The alleged love story: How the dating rumors started between Justin Fields and Gianna Carmona

New York Jets quarterback Justin Fields has long been in the spotlight for his career highs and struggles in the NFL. But in recent months, attention has shifted toward his personal life, with rumors linking him to Gianna Carmona, a fashion model, influencer, and former college volleyball player. While neither of them has confirmed their relationship, fans and media outlets continue to speculate about the pair.Gianna Carmona, 21, is carving her own path as a lifestyle and fashion influencer. With 15.3K followers on Instagram (@giannacarmona) and more than 27K fans on TikTok (@giannacarmona_), she frequently shares bold, stylish content that resonates with a younger audience. Raised in Silver Spring, Maryland, Gianna comes from a close-knit family with her parents, Norberto Carmona and Annie Franco, as well as two siblings, Xavier and Sasha.Sports also run deep in her family. Her cousin, Jioranni Rodriguez, once played football at Towson University, and Gianna herself competed as an outside hitter/middle blocker for the Towson Tigers volleyball team. That athletic background may explain why she seems so comfortable in NFL circles.Speculation about Fields and Carmona’s connection first surfaced in March 2023 after the two reportedly vacationed in Turks and Caicos.The rumors picked up when Gianna was spotted at NFL games for both the Chicago Bears and Pittsburgh Steelers — two of the teams Fields has previously played for. While neither has addressed the whispers, fans have not missed the subtle social media overlaps, often tagging Fields in Carmona’s posts.Fields, who signed a two-year, $40 million contract with the Jets in the 2025 offseason, is heading into what many analysts call a “make-or-break” year. Coming off a concussion in Week 3, he is set to return against the Miami Dolphins under the bright lights of Monday Night Football.

Jake Browning faces big test for Bengals against Broncos



Jake Browning has a career-defining chance under the lights of Monday Night Football as the Cincinnati Bengals face the Denver Broncos. While the quarterback is preparing for the pressure of the Mile High atmosphere, his fiancée Stephanie Niles is grabbing attention of her own with a bold Bengals-inspired game-day look. Even though she didn’t travel to Denver, her presence is felt as she continues to be one of the most visible supporters of the Bengals’ new starter.While Jake Browning prepares for the Broncos, Niles has become a story of her own. Raised in Shanghai before moving to Seattle in 2005, she later met Browning at the University of Washington in 2018. A business-minded professional, she earned her degree in informational systems and accounting, worked in New York for an accounting firm, and even co-founded a swimsuit brand called 7th Street Swim.Her fashion-forward approach has made her a standout on Bengals’ game days. From her custom “6” gear to her latest fit she proudly described as “proud of this one,” Niles has embraced her role in the spotlight. Off the field, she has worn many hats, from project management to finance roles, always balancing career ambitions with her personal journey alongside Browning.The couple’s bond has only grown stronger. Browning proposed in Malibu in November 2024, with Niles sharing her joy in a heartfelt post, “HAPPILY EVER AFTER!!!!!!! 💍💍💍💍.”Now, as Browning takes the field in one of his biggest tests yet, Niles’ unwavering support continues to be part of his story.The 29-year-old quarterback was thrust into the spotlight after Joe Burrow went down with a long-term turf toe injury. Browning delivered a win in his first outing but stumbled badly in last week’s loss to the Minnesota Vikings, throwing five interceptions in just two games. Now, against Denver’s aggressive defense, he must prove he can settle in and lead an offense under enormous pressure.Despite his shaky start, Browning has shown resilience before. His college years at Washington made him a star, but his NFL path was anything but easy. After going undrafted, he bounced around with the Minnesota Vikings before finally landing with Cincinnati in 2023. This season marks his biggest chance to silence doubts and show he belongs as a starter.Also Read: Shedeur Sanders’ mom Pilar unleashes bold response after Rex Ryan crushes Browns rookie quarterback on live TV",Cincinnati bengals quarterback jake browning faces denver broncos on monday night football.

Pilar Sanders’ powerful Instagram message goes viral



Shedeur Sanders has many admirers across the NFL , but none stand taller in his corner than his family. So when ESPN analyst and former New York Jets head coach Rex Ryan publicly criticized the Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback, it was only a matter of time before Shedeur’s mother, Pilar Sanders, came forward with a fiery response.Deion Sanders’ son is already one of the league’s most popular young players, with Browns fans eagerly buying his jersey and hoping he eventually replaces veteran Joe Flacco. While head coach Kevin Stefanski seems more inclined to test rookie Dillon Gabriel, much of the fanbase sees Shedeur as the future. That optimism, however, clashed with Ryan’s blunt remarks on ESPN’s Get Up.“This kid talks and he runs his mouth,” Ryan said, mocking Shedeur’s confidence. “Like he said, ‘I can be a starting quarterback’ with his arms crossed like this. Get your ass in the front row and study and do all that. If I know, the whole league knows. Quit being an embarrassment that way. You’ve got the talent to be the quarterback, you should be. You should be embarrassed that you’re not the quarterback now.”Ryan’s words quickly made waves, but Pilar Sanders wasted no time striking back with passion.Pilar took to Instagram to defend her son, sharing a scathing post aimed directly at Ryan. “To young Athletes and Football fans... This is what impotent, cancerous, envious energy looks like,” she wrote. “This type of Evile [sic] goes waaay back – you can cut it with a knife – embedded in blood and bones seeping through all of the rotting worm holes [sic] it has. What and who does he really represent? Its’ family and peers should be embarrassed to know and let this on their platforms. There's no room for this type in sports. Please 🤫... Tsk tsk tsk... Enuff!”She followed with a simple caption: “Sad…”Her words struck a chord, resonating with fans who believe Shedeur deserves patience and support rather than public ridicule. The episode also highlighted how fiercely protective his family remains, especially as he battles to carve out his place in the NFL spotlight.Stay tuned, because as this back-and-forth shows, criticizing Shedeur Sanders might just unleash a storm. And if there’s one lesson here, it’s clear: never underestimate a mother’s defense of her son.Also Read: “Having heart failure”: Giants fan defends herself after viral backlash for taking Patrick Mahomes’ headband from young boy","Pilar sanders fiercely defends son shedeur after rex ryan brutally criticizes browns rookie quarterback on espn.

The Kansas City Chiefs’ road victory against the New York Giants on September 21 at MetLife Stadium made headlines for more than just the game. A post-game moment involving Patrick Mahomes , a young fan, and an adult Giants supporter has spiraled into one of the season’s most talked-about viral controversies.After the game, Patrick Mahomes was spotted greeting fans and appeared to hand his game-worn headband to a 10-year-old Chiefs supporter who was celebrating his birthday. However, in a video that spread rapidly across social media, Nina Miller, a Giants fan wearing team gear, was seen taking the headband before the child could secure it.The clip drew immediate outrage, with fans dubbing her the “Kansas City Karen.” Internet sleuths quickly tracked Miller’s social accounts, uncovering a now-deleted video where she bragged about the keepsake. This fueled the perception that the act was intentional and not a misunderstanding.Amid mounting backlash, Miller posted a TikTok video on September 27, claiming the moment was chaotic. “Everyone is having heart failure over this,” she said, emphasizing that fans from multiple rows had rushed the front.She argued that she “paid for” her seat and didn’t realize the headband was meant for the boy.In a follow-up video the next day, Miller softened her tone, explaining, “At the game, with all the noise and all the excitement, I honestly thought that Pat Mahomes was giving me the headband. I reached for it without thinking.” She admitted later learning it was intended for the young fan’s birthday and added, “I’m sorry that I ruined your moment.

Joe Burrow’s injury update and timeline for return



Impact on Bengals’ season and playoff chances without Joe Burrow



The Cincinnati Bengals are once again staring at uncertainty after quarterback Joe Burrow suffered a severe turf toe injury that required surgery. The timing could not be worse, as the team’s playoff hopes now hang in the balance while their franchise player faces an extended recovery.Joe Burrow went down in Week 2 against the Jacksonville Jaguars and was later diagnosed with a Grade 3 turf toe injury, a condition serious enough to sideline most players for months. NFL Network’s Ian Rapoport reported that Burrow underwent surgery and is expected to miss “at least three months.” That puts his earliest possible return in late December, lining up with Week 16 against the Miami Dolphins.The timeline, however, is far from guaranteed. FOX Sports’ Jay Glazer questioned whether the three-month window is realistic, calling it “very aggressive.” He noted, “They’re saying three months, I don’t see three months being an actual timeline. I think more so [Burrow has] a chance [to return] if they make the playoffs, but only because it’s Joe Burrow. Somebody else, I’d say no. But he has that Mamba Mentality, maybe yes. It’s such a difficult injury to return from.”That reality means the Bengals must prepare for the likelihood that Burrow may not return during the regular season.Even in a best-case scenario, his availability depends heavily on whether Cincinnati remains in the postseason hunt.The loss of Burrow immediately reshaped expectations for the Bengals, who entered 2025 with legitimate Super Bowl aspirations. Without their star quarterback, Cincinnati has turned to Jake Browning. While Browning has shown flashes of potential, his early performances have been inconsistent, raising doubts about the Bengals’ ability to stay competitive in the tough AFC North.The division itself leaves little room for error. With the Ravens and Browns already stacking wins, every setback without Burrow makes the climb toward a Wild Card spot more difficult. The Bengals’ offensive rhythm has struggled without their leader, particularly in the passing game, which was built around Burrow’s precision and composure.The bigger question now is whether the team would risk bringing Burrow back late in the season if he isn’t fully ready. Turf toe can have lingering effects, and rushing a return could jeopardize his long-term health. The Bengals’ medical staff will need to weigh playoff chances against preserving the future of their franchise quarterback.For now, Joe Burrow’s regular season is in jeopardy. A late December comeback is possible, but only if recovery progresses perfectly and the Bengals remain in contention. Otherwise, fans may have to wait until 2026 to see him fully healthy under center again.Also Read: Braelon Allen injury update: What happened to New York Jets RB that made him leave Monday Night Football","Cincinnati bengals quarterback joe burrow suffered a severe turf toe injury in week 2.

“Woefully ignorant”: Travis Kelce and Andy Reid’s sideline behavior shocks fans after weeks of tension,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/woefully-ignorant-travis-kelce-and-andy-reids-sideline-behavior-shocks-fans-after-weeks-of-tension/articleshow/124223116.cms,"Andy Reid & Travis Kelce (Getty Images)

A complete turnaround from MetLife tensions

Is Travis Kelce being preserved for a playoff push?

The Kansas City Chiefs may have handled the Baltimore Ravens with ease in Week 4, but it was the sideline atmosphere between Travis Kelce and Andy Reid that truly stood out. Just a week after their heated exchange against the New York Giants, the two appeared lighthearted and united, giving fans plenty to talk about.During the Chiefs’ 37-20 win at Arrowhead Stadium, cameras caught Kelce and Reid sharing laughs and even an embrace—a sharp contrast to the tense shouting match that played out on September 22 at MetLife. For many fans, this moment confirmed what insiders have long suggested: their fiery sideline disputes are rooted in competitiveness, not division.One fan on X summed it up perfectly, writing, “Anyone who thinks those 2 don’t love each other are woefully ignorant.” Another joked about the duo’s chemistry, suggesting Kelce was teasing his coach mid-game: “He’s saying to Andy, ‘What can we give them to rant about this week?’”The show of unity couldn’t have come at a better time. With Patrick Mahomes spreading the ball to four different receivers for touchdowns, Kansas City looked like the dominant team that stormed to a Super Bowl win just two seasons ago.Despite his steady presence in the offense, Kelce’s red-zone numbers have raised eyebrows. At 36, the tight end has only one touchdown this season—a 37-yard score against the Chargers. Some analysts believe Reid and Mahomes may be intentionally scaling back his scoring role to preserve him for a deep postseason run, much like they did in 2023 when Rashee Rice emerged late but Kelce dominated in the playoffs.His 15 catches for 182 yards prove he’s still a reliable target, averaging 12.1 yards per reception—remarkably consistent for a veteran in his mid-30s. With Xavier Worthy just returning from injury and Rice sidelined, Kelce continues to carry a heavy load in sustaining drives.Also Read: “Having heart failure”: Giants fan defends herself after viral backlash for taking Patrick Mahomes’ headband from young boy Fans now wonder if this season could be his “last hurrah,” with a carefully managed workload designed to unleash him when it matters most—January and February football.","The kansas city chiefs beat the baltimore ravens 37-20 on sunday.

Jets’ game plan built around Justin Fields’ strengths tonight

The New York Jets are gearing up to face the Miami Dolphins tonight in Week 4, and all eyes are on quarterback Justin Fields. Known for his dual-threat ability and fearless arm, Fields is the centerpiece of New York’s offense. Tonight isn’t just another game—it’s about a young leader returning from injury and carrying the hopes of a Jets team eager to make a statement in the AFC East.Yes, Justin Fields is confirmed active and expected to start under center. Cleared by the Jets’ medical staff, Fields will take his normal workload with no limitations.

There are no lingering issues, and the Jets are confident their star QB can handle the pressure and lead the offense against a tough Miami defense.In Week 1 against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Fields looked sharp, completing 72.7% of his passes for 218 yards with one touchdown and no interceptions, posting a 119.1 passer rating. His dual-threat ability also made an impact on the ground, helping sustain drives and keep defenses guessing.Week 2 against the Buffalo Bills was more difficult.

His dual-threat skillset makes him dangerous both in the air and on the ground.Coach Glenn is expected to build the game plan around Fields’ ability to read defenses quickly and extend plays with his legs. He will serve as the primary weapon on early downs while also using mobility to keep Miami’s defense guessing. His poise under pressure and smart decision-making will be critical in giving New York a chance to compete in this pivotal AFC East matchup.With Fields back under center, tonight’s game promises to highlight his leadership, dual-threat impact, and ability to manage the offense.
