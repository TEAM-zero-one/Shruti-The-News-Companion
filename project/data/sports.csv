Meet the Indian world champion who memorised 80 numbers in 13.5 seconds,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/meet-the-indian-world-champion-who-memorised-80-numbers-in-13-5-seconds/articleshow/118432579.cms,"How do you prepare for the Memory League World Championship?

What does your memory palace look like?

How much can these rooms hold?

Can you describe one of the challenges in Memory League World Championship?

Do you realise how amazing this is?

What's next?

In early Feb, Vishvaa Rajakumar , a 20-year-old Indian college student, won the Memory League World Championship , an online competition pitting people against one another with challenges like memorising the order of 80 random numbers faster than most people can tie a shoelace.Renowned neuroscientist Eleanor Maguire, who died in Jan, studied mental athletes like Rajakumar and found that many of them used the ancient Roman ""method of loci,"" a memorisation trick also known as the "" memory palace .""The technique takes several forms, but it generally involves visualising a large house and assigning memories to rooms. Mentally walking through the house fires up the hippocampus, the seahorse-shaped engine of memory deep in the brain that consumed Maguire's career.NYT asked Rajakumar about his strategies of memorisation. His answers:Hydration is very important because it helps your brain. When you memorise things, you usually sub-vocalise, and it helps to have a clear throat. Let's say you're reading a book. You're not reading it out loud, but you are vocalising within yourself. If you don't drink a lot of water, your speed will be a bit low. If you drink a lot of water, it will be more and more clear and you can read it faster.Let's say my first location is my room where I sleep. My second location is the kitchen. And the third location is my hall. The fourth location is my veranda. Another location is my bathroom. Let's say I am memorising a list of words. Let's say 10 words. What I do is, I take a pair of words, make a story out of them and place them in a location. And I take the next two words. I make a story out of them. I place them in the second location. The memory palace will help you to remember the sequence.A lot. Let's say I'm memorising 100 words. I'm making a story out of every two words. There will be a set of 50 stories. But I can't remember which one came first or which one came second. That would be a problem, right? So if I use the memory palace, I can remember which came first and which came second. So likewise, I can remember all of the 50 stories.They give you 80 random numbers that they display on a screen. You have to memorise all of those numbers as fast as possible, then click a button and a recall sheet appears. I wrote down all of the 80 digits - and I got them all right. My fastest time to memorise 80 random digits in World Championship was 13.5 seconds, so almost six digits per second.Yes, I do. I was crying.After completion of college, like in two to three months, I'll probably try to be a memory trainer and create a memory institution in India to teach other people these techniques. My goal is to make it big. NYT","Vishvaa rajakumar, 20, won the memory league world championship.

Anthony Edwards’ confident exchange with Barack Obama during Team USA event made headlines



Minnesota Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards has made a name for himself as one of the most promising young players in the NBA. The way the rising standout star has been playing his game led many to draw comparisons between Edwards and the legendary Michael Jordan . However, the 23-year-old guard has made it clear that he is not interested in being measured against the greatest player of all time.During All-Star Weekend, Anthony Edwards was asked about adding any of Michael Jordan ’s signature moves into his own game. Ant-Man did not hesitate to refute the comparison. “No moves, man. Shout out to MJ, he the GOAT. I just wish y’all would stop comparing me to him,” he said. Of course, Edwards appreciates the respect that comes with the comparison, but he seems to feel that it adds unnecessary pressure.Edwards has consistently shown that he wants to be recognized for his own unique style of play rather than living in the shadow of NBA legends.This isn’t the first time Edwards has downplayed his place in the sport. Despite being widely regarded as one of the NBA’s next big superstars, he doesn’t see himself as the future face of the league. When recently asked if he envisions himself as the league’s next top player, especially with legends like LeBron James, Kevin Durant, and Stephen Curry nearing the end of their careers, his response was refreshingly candid, “No, not really.” Instead, Edwards pointed to San Antonio Spurs rookie sensation Victor Wembanyama, saying, “That’s what they got Wemby for.”He elaborated further in an interview with TNT, “I’m capable of being that guy. But I don’t want to be that guy, I’ll put it like that. I want to be the guy that just show up and hoop and just kill dudes and go home.”Edwards' confidence isn’t just limited to his performances on the court. Recently, he made headlines for his bold exchange with former U.S. President Barack Obama during Netflix’s Court of Gold docuseries, which provided a behind-the-scenes look at Team USA’s preparations for the Paris Olympics.In one interesting moment, Obama jokingly asked Philadelphia 76ers star Joel Embiid about Edwards, saying, “What do you think about this young guy? He can hoop a little bit, huh?” Embiid, with a smile, responded, “Just a little bit.” But Edwards, never one to back down, immediately responded with his usual candid manner, “Nah, y’all better stand down. I’m the truth.”Also Read: Jimmy Butler addresses beef with Miami Heat after blockbuster trade to Golden State Warriors: “It didn’t end the way everybody hoped” The 23-year-old Minnesota Timberwolves star player has been one of the best in the league with astonishing stats already added to his name.

Isabela Ferrer REVEALS Taylor Swift Helped Her Get ‘It Ends with Us’ Role (Exclusive)

Fans Have Reacted Pretty Strongly As Many Slam Blake Lively For The Whole Drama



Taylor Swift, the billionaire pop star, has been in the news ever since she got booed at the Super Bowl 2025 while her boyfriend, Travis Kelce led Kansas City Chiefs lost the trophy to the Philadelphia Eagles. Away from the Super Bowl drama, Taylor Swift has also gotten herself involved in the legal drama between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, even though she has not been sued. But now it seems like there is some fresh drama regarding it.Famous social media influencer Melanie King recently uploaded a video on X with some fresh evidence that Taylor Swift was indeed “involved” in the making of Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni’s hit movie It Ends With Us. The video has Justin Baldoni talking to an interviewer about the casting for Isabella Ferrer who played the role of young Blake in the blockbuster movie.As Justin Baldoni discusses about finding the perfect person for the role, the interviewer says, “You told me Taylor Swift helped her get the role? Like signed off on audition?”To this, Justin Baldoni says, “I was casting and I had actually brought in and showed her casting tape to Blake and Taylor. They were both like “Yes her!” and that’s a true story”. The interviewer then asked Justin Baldoni how he had convinced Taylor Swift to lend her song for their movie and Justin Baldoni says, “I had nothing to do with it. I mean this is all Blake”.Justin Baldoni continued, “Like I said, Blake was involved in all aspects of this production and she is also a marketing genius”.Melanie King’s caption for the video reads as, “Taylor Swift caught in a HUGE lie. She said she had no part in the casting of this actress for It Ends With Us. Ma’am Justin Baldoni has the receipts. Bless his heart. He was trying to be positive while they were destroying his entire life behind the scenes.”The social media influencer, Melanie King, also went on to add that even though Taylor Swift did not officially cast Isabella Ferrer in the movie, it was her choice that was taken into consider by the production company.Fans have reacted strongly to this. A fan commented, “I don't know that Taylor is lying. She may have just been having conversations with her friend, who then used that to get her way. I'm not saying it didn't happen, but I lean towards Blake twisting things to use the power of Taylor's name”.Another fan wrote, “I suspect Blake has been overstating how involved Taylor actually is.”Taylor Swift has not issued a statement about the whole drama between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni and has remained silent.

The outspoken and charismatic father of basketball stars, recently had his right foot amputated following a serious medical issue. The news, first reported by TMZ Sports on Wednesday, has yet to be publicly addressed by LaVar or his sons. However, despite the health issue, sources confirm that the 57-year-old remains in great spirits. LaVar Ball has long been a popular figure in the sports world who made his name known for his larger-than-life personality and relentless promotion of his sons. He co-founded the Big Baller Brand, which gained attention for launching signature shoes for the Ball brothers and making headlines with its ambitious $3 billion price tag for a deal with major sneaker companies. However, his recent health battle has brought a different kind of attention to the Ball family.According to TMZ Sports, LaVar underwent the amputation procedure on Wednesday afternoon. Though details surrounding the medical issue remain undisclosed, reports indicate that the father of basketball stars and musician Lonzo, LiAngelo, and LaMelo Ball , is handling the situation quite well. A recently surfaced photo of LaVar smiling post-surgery showed his positive attitude as he fought back despite the life-altering event.So far, none of the Ball brothers have publicly addressed their father’s surgery. LaMelo Ball is currently playing for the Charlotte Hornets, while Lonzo Ball , who plays for the Chicago Bulls, has been dealing with his own injury struggles. LiAngelo Ball, though never making an NBA roster, has been pursuing a career in music.Given LaVar’s history of fiercely supporting his sons, fans have no doubt that his family is rallying around him during this time. While he has kept a lower profile in recent years, LaVar remains a strong presence in their lives.Before becoming a household name in the basketball world, LaVar Ball had his own journey as an athlete. He played college basketball at Cal State-Los Angeles and had brief stints with the New York Jets and Carolina Panthers during his attempt at a professional football career.Though he has drawn criticism for his bold proclamations— such as claiming he could beat Michael Jordan one-on-one— LaVar has also been praised for his dedication to his sons’ success. He created the Big Baller Brand, which sought to disrupt the sneaker industry by giving young athletes an alternative to mainstream endorsement deals.Also Read: NBA Drama Unfolds: LiAngelo Ball's Ex-Girlfriend Nikki Mudarris Exchanges Jabs With His New Baby Mama After Cheating Allegation: ""You can keep him"" Fans are waiting for comments from the Ball family detailing LaVar’s health crisis and what led to the amputation of his right foot. However, details surrounding the incident are yet to be revealed. Regardless, it appears that he is now out of any danger and dealing with his recovery.LaMelo Ball took the court against the Los Angeles Lakers just hours after news about his father made headlines.

Kansas City Chiefs cannot match the Chicago Bears’ offer, and Trey Smith is set to hit the open market

The Athletic’s

“The Chiefs are not expected to place the franchise tag or the transition tag on Smith, according to a league source.”

Trey Smith and Darnell Wright played together at Tennessee, and the Bears could reunite them in 2025

Bleacher Report

“If Smith does end up in the Windy City, he’ll be reunited with stalwart right tackle Darnell Wright. Smith played next to Wright for two years at Tennessee, and the two could jump-start a flailing Bears offensive line together in 2025.”

If the Chicago Bears sign Trey Smith, the offensive guard market will shift dramatically

“Smith is a powerful mover in the run game, as his run block win rate of 75.1% ranked sixth among guards. Plus, he has the foot speed to mirror interior defenders and the strength at 6-6 and 321 pounds to anchor against bull rushes. Bears general manager Ryan Poles could make a splash move to rebuild the front for Ben Johnson’s new offense.”

If they want their No. 1 overall pick to succeed, fixing this line isn’t optional—it’s survival.Enter Kansas City Chiefs guard Trey Smith . At 25, he’s already one of the best guards in the league. He’s played over 1,200 snaps every season since being drafted in 2021. He doesn’t miss games. He doesn’t miss assignments. He doesn’t get bullied.The Bears reportedly plan to offer Smith a five-year, $105 million deal. That would make him one of the highest-paid guards in history. It’s a massive commitment, but if they don’t do it, someone else will.Kansas City wants to keep Trey Smith. But wanting and affording are two very different things.

They played side by side at Tennessee for two years. That chemistry matters.Rebuilding an offensive line isn’t just about talent—it’s about trust.

They’re building a foundation.The Bears’ reported $105 million offer would be the new gold standard for guards. Right now, Atlanta Falcons’ Chris Lindstrom holds the record with a $102.5 million contract. Philadelphia Eagles’ Landon Dickerson sits at $84 million, with $21 million per year.

Is LeBron James playing tonight? Los Angeles Lakers injury report for tonight’s game against the Charlotte Hornets

Los Angeles Lakers injury report (Image via NBA)

’ status for the’ upcoming game against the Charlotte Hornets remains uncertain as he is listed as questionable due to a foot injury. The Lakers, holding a 32-20 record, are set to face the struggling Hornets (13-39) at Crypto.com Arena on Wednesday, February 19, at 10:00 PM ET. James’ potential absence could significantly impact the Lakers’ performance, as he continues to be a cornerstone of the team’s success. LeBron James , averaging 24.4 points, 7.4 rebounds, and 8.6 assists over the last 20 games, is not only the Los Angeles Lakers’ leading scorer but also their top rebounder and playmaker. His ability to dominate both ends of the floor has been crucial for Los Angeles, which ranks 14th in the league with 113.3 points per game. Without him, the team’s offensive rhythm and defensive presence could take a hit, especially against a Hornets squad that, despite their poor record, has shown resilience in certain areas.The Lakers’ injury report also includes Maxi Kleber, who is out with a foot injury. Kleber’s absence further depletes the team’s depth, putting additional pressure on role players like Austin Reaves and Rui Hachimura to step up. Reaves, averaging 20.2 points and 6.9 assists in the last 20 games, has been a reliable secondary option, but the Lakers’ chances of securing a win would undoubtedly be higher with LeBron James on the court.On the Hornets’ side, LaMelo Ball is listed as probable with an ankle injury, providing a glimmer of hope for Charlotte. Ball, averaging 27.3 points per game, is the Hornets’ leading scorer and a key facilitator. His presence could pose challenges for the Los Angeles Lakers’ defense, particularly if LeBron James is sidelined. However, the Hornets are dealing with their own injury woes, including season-ending absences for Grant Williams, Brandon Miller, and Tre Mann.The game will be broadcast on SportsNet LA and FDSSE, with live streaming available on Fubo. Fans can also engage with the action through FanDuel Fantasy, adding an extra layer of excitement to the matchup.Also read: Why are the Los Angeles Lakers and Charlotte Hornets playing today?

Reflecting on 'What Could Have Been'

In a candid reflection, Carson Wentz has expressed a heartfelt desire to have been the one leading the Philadelphia Eagles to their historic 2018 Super Bowl victory . In a recent interview, Wentz admitted, ""I would love to trade places with Nick Foles and win that Super Bowl back in the day.""During the 2017 NFL season, Carson Wentz was on an MVP trajectory, steering the Eagles to an impressive 11-2 record. However, a devastating ACL injury in Week 14 abruptly ended his season. This setback paved the way for backup quarterback Nick Foles to step in. Foles not only filled the void but led the team through the playoffs, culminating in a stunning 41-33 victory over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LII.Wentz's absence during this pinnacle moment was emotionally challenging. Reports from 2022 suggest that he ""voiced his displeasure with the Eagles' success"" to fellow injured teammates during the Super Bowl run. This sentiment led to a confrontation, highlighting the internal struggle Wentz faced watching his team achieve glory without him.Despite the emotional turmoil, Carson Wentz has consistently maintained respect and camaraderie towards Foles. Their relationship, though tested by circumstances, remained professional. Foles, after leading the Eagles to their first Super Bowl win, handled his return to a backup role with grace, emphasizing the team's success over individual accolades.The 2018 season saw Carson Wentz's return to the field, but lingering injuries and the shadow of the previous season's success created a complex environment. Foles once again stepped in towards the season's end, leading the Eagles to the playoffs, though they fell short of another Super Bowl appearance.Carson Wentz's recent admission sheds light on the personal and professional challenges athletes face when sidelined during critical moments. His longing to have been the one to secure the championship for Philadelphia underscores the weight of expectations and the unpredictability of sports careers.As Carson Wentz continues his journey in the NFL, his reflections serve as a testament to resilience and the complex emotions inherent in professional sports.Also read - Jason Kelce Hints That Taylor Swift Is Changing Travis Kelce—""He Was Like Peter Pan"" Before","Carson wentz has expressed a heartfelt desire to have been the one leading the philadelphia eagles to their historic 2018 super bowl victory.

Team India undergoes intense training in Dubai ahead of Champions Trophy | Exclusive Visuals

India begin Champions Trophy prep | Rishabh Pant struck on knee

India's probable XI vs Bangladesh:

Hot favourites India will begin their Champions Trophy campaign against Bangladesh in Group A on Thursday, and with just four teams in each group of the eight-team competition, every game matters in the quest to finish in the top two to qualify for the semifinals.Besides Bangladesh, India's other competitors in the group are hosts and defending champions Pakistan as well as New Zealand.India, who will play all their matches in Dubai, have the advantage of playing the entire tournament at just one venue and the players won't have to adjust to different pitches, unlike the other seven teams who will play across four venues -- Lahore, Karachi and Rawalpindi in Pakistan as well as Dubai.But the first match remains tricky. Despite knowing the historical nature of the Dubai track to have something in it for both batters and bowlers, India will have to take a call on whether to go in with three spinners or three pacers from their spin-heavy 15-member squad.India suffered a blow just before the tournament, with ace fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah ruled out because of a back injury. And with Mohammed Shami only recently returning to the team after a year-long injury layoff and Arshdeep Singh short on ODI experience, India coach Gautam Gambhir and captain Rohit Sharma have work to do in order to pick the bowling combination they want to go ahead with.India have as many as five spinners in the squad; namely Kuldeep Yadav, Varun Chakravarthy, and all-rounders Ravindra Jadeja, Axar Patel and Washington Sundar. While the pace-bowling unit has Harshit Rana and all-rounder Hardik Pandya besides Shami and Arshdeep.The dew expected late in the evening in Dubai is one factor that may prevent India from picking three spinners as it makes it difficult to grip the dewy ball. But with Axar being used at No. 5 against England and doing well, his inclusion can give India the balance they seek with a left-handed batting option in the mix in top five.However, the batting order looks sorted as the likes of Rohit, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer and KL Rahul pick themselves, unless the think-tank wants Rishabh Pant to do the wicketkeeping duties instead of Rahul, who did the job during the three-match ODI series against England just before the Champions Trophy.Rohit Sharma (c), Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, Shreyas Iyer, Hardik Pandya, Axar Patel, KL Rahul (wk), Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Shami, Kuldeep Yadav, Arshdeep Singh","India will begin their champions trophy campaign against bangladesh in group a on thursday.

Bobby Portis Banned 25 Games Amid Milwaukee Bucks' Playoff Push



Impact on the Milwaukee Bucks



Despite the setback, Portis remains focused.



The Milwaukee Bucks just got hit with a major setback. Forward Bobby Portis has been suspended 25 games without pay after testing positive for Tramadol, a banned substance under the NBA/NBPA Anti-Drug Program. The announcement came Thursday, leaving the Bucks scrambling as they push for a strong playoff position. Portis, known for his high-energy play and physical presence, has been a key piece of Milwaukee’s rotation. His absence will force the team to adjust quickly, with just a handful of regular-season games left before the postseason. Bobby Portis expressed deep regret over the situation, taking full responsibility for his actions.""I feel horrible and take full responsibility,"" he said. ""I sincerely apologize to the Bucks organization, my teammates, coaches, family, and fans. I give everything I have on the court and will miss playing during this time.""His agent, Mark Bartelstein, defended him, claiming the violation resulted from an unfortunate mix-up.""Bobby unintentionally took Tramadol, thinking it was Toradol,"" Bartelstein explained. ""Toradol is an approved pain medication he has used before. The Tramadol pill came from an assistant with a valid prescription, who mistakenly told Bobby it was Toradol. This was an honest mistake.""Despite the explanation, the NBA enforced its strict anti-drug policy. Bucks GM Jon Horst acknowledged the difficult situation but stood by Portis.“This is tough for Bobby and the team,” Horst said. “He and the Bucks respect the NBA/NBPA Anti-Drug Program and will accept the decision. But we fully support Bobby—he’s an integral part of this team and our community.”The Milwaukee Bucks just got hit with a major setback.

He’s been one of the best bench players in the league, finishing top three in Sixth Man of the Year voting the past two seasons. Without him, Milwaukee will have to dig deep to stay competitive.The Bucks still have an open roster spot, so they could bring in a temporary replacement. But Portis’ toughness and energy aren’t easy to replace.“I will work hard and be ready for our playoff run.

That they’re still in a strong position when he does.","Bobby portis has been suspended 25 games without pay after testing positive for tramadol.
