IPL 2025 Final | Rishi Sunak Interview: 'I am a big Virat Kohli fan... RCB is my team'

Teams:





NEW DELHI: Much was expected from Royal Challengers Bengaluru stalwart Virat Kohli in the IPL 2025 final against Punjab Kings at the Narendra Modi Stadium on Tuesday. Fans hoped to see a trademark Kohli masterclass under pressure, but the RCB batter couldn’t quite hit top gear in the summit clash.Kohli adopted a rather cautious approach, scoring 43 runs off 35 deliveries before falling to Azmatullah Omarzai. The Afghanistan pacer pulled off a stunning caught-and-bowled effort to dismiss the RCB icon.It was a short delivery, rising steeply off the pitch. Kohli went for the pull but only managed a top edge. With no fielder at mid-wicket, Omarzai sprinted after the ball, collided slightly with the non-striker but managed to recover, accelerate, and dive full stretch to complete a brilliant two-handed catch.Kohli, visibly disappointed, walked back with his head down, knowing he had missed an opportunity to anchor a bigger knock on the big stage.Kohli was trolled after getting out.Earlier, Punjab Kings skipper Shreyas Iyer won the toss and elected to field. Both sides went into the final unchanged from their previous matches. With RCB and PBKS both eyeing their maiden IPL title, the 18th edition of the league is guaranteed a brand-new champion.Royal Challengers Bengaluru: Philip Salt, Virat Kohli, Mayank Agarawal, Rajat Patidar(c), Liam Livingstone, Jitesh Sharma(w), Romario Shepherd, Krunal Pandya, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Yash Dayal, Josh HazlewoodPunjab Kings: Priyansh Arya, Josh Inglis(w), Shreyas Iyer(c), Nehal Wadhera, Shashank Singh, Marcus Stoinis, Azmatullah Omarzai, Kyle Jamieson, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Arshdeep Singh, Yuzvendra Chahal.",Royal challengers bengaluru face punjab kings in ipl 2025 final.

Is Travis Kelce done with football? Hollywood move sparks rumors of secret retirement plan,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/is-travis-kelce-done-with-football-hollywood-move-sparks-rumors-of-secret-retirement-plan/articleshow/121608617.cms,"Travis Kelce is strategically positioning himself for a post-NFL career in Hollywood (Getty Images)

From Super Bowl Sundays to silver screen stardom: Travis Kelce prepares for life after football

Podcasting power moves and a strategic agency shift signal serious career planning

Despite rising fame, Travis Kelce insists he’s not done with football — yet





Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce appears to be seriously paving the way for a post-football career, and it’s not just through endorsements or podcasting — he’s heading straight for Hollywood. With retirement discussions intensifying, Kelce is aligning his off-field presence with opportunities that suggest he’s gearing up for a full pivot into entertainment.Travis Kelce’s first major acting role will come in the highly anticipated Happy Gilmore 2, starring Adam Sandler. Sandler himself had high praise for the tight end: “We have a nice something for Travis... What a big handsome guy. Funny and cool as hell. He’s a stud, and he’s so funny.” This isn’t Kelce’s first brush with TV — he previously appeared in FX’s horror series Grotesquerie and the 2020 sci-fi comedy Moonbase 8. But this upcoming film marks his cinematic debut, and one that could launch him into a new stratosphere of stardom.Kelce and his brother Jason recently inked a massive $100 million deal with Amazon for their New Heights podcast, which has become a cultural phenomenon.The podcast not only expanded their fanbase but also cemented the Kelce brothers as media personalities beyond football. Behind the scenes, Kelce’s management team, A&A Management, was acquired by entertainment powerhouse 3 Arts Entertainment — a move that aligns with long-term plans to transition smoothly into film and TV.The Eanes brothers, who represent Kelce, have drawn comparisons between him and Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, noting Kelce’s rare mix of charisma, athleticism, and on-screen potential. It’s a bold comparison, but not an unreasonable one. The NFL star’s personality, already beloved by fans, seems tailor-made for the screen.Though Kelce remains under contract with the Chiefs through 2027, he has openly acknowledged that the end of his NFL career is approaching. After the team fell short of a Super Bowl three-peat, many speculated that Kelce might hang up his cleats. However, he confirmed that he would return for at least one more season.Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes quickly shut down any talk of Kelce coasting to retirement: “The way he’s talking about football… he doesn’t seem like a guy on his last ride.” Kelce’s path forward seems clear — dominate on the field for one last run, then take on Hollywood full force.Also Read: “Travis Kelce was becoming a dad”: Fans divided over controversial image of Taylor Swift debating if she is really in the middle of a secret pregnancy with Travis Kelce","Travis kelce's first major acting role will come in the highly anticipated happy gilmore 2, starring adam sandler.

What sparked the recent tension between LeBron and Windhorst?

The latest escalation in their feud





andhave a complicated history, and their recent public exchanges have brought their strained relationship into the spotlight. The Lakers star has taken shots at the ESPN reporter, calling him ""weird"" and dismissing his claims about their past connection. Here’s what’s behind their feud and why it’s heating up now. LeBron James and Brian Windhorst go way back—all the way to LeBron’s high school days in Akron, Ohio. Windhorst covered local sports for the *Akron Beacon Journal*, where he first reported on the future NBA superstar. Both attended St. Vincent-St. Mary’s High School and grew up on the west side of Akron. Their connection even extended to Windhorst’s mother, who taught sex education to both of them.For years, Brian Windhorst was one of the few reporters with close access to LeBron James. He was reportedly the only journalist allowed to speak with LeBron when his then-girlfriend was about to give birth to their son, Bronny. But as James’ fame grew, their relationship shifted, with the natural divide between athlete and reporter becoming more pronounced.The feud became public when LeBron James appeared on The Pat McAfee Show and took aim at Windhorst. He mocked the reporter’s claims of being close to him and criticized his analysis of James’ Nike deal, which Windhorst suggested was influenced by Michael Jordan “I see Brian Windhorst on one of these shows not too long ago. The guy who says he’s like my (expletive) best friend,” James said. “These guys… it’s weird.”Windhorst responded by clarifying their relationship, stating, “LeBron doesn’t owe me anything, I owe him a lot. Just know, I met LeBron 25 years ago. And my understanding of LeBron and where people stand in his life has been crystal clear.” (H/t Sporting News)The conflict took another turn when James’ podcast, *Mind the Game*, used a clip of Windhorst from *First Take* in a promotional video. The clip appeared to show Windhorst dismissing the idea of a basketball show focused on X’s and O’s, though the context wasn’t entirely clear. James reposted the edited clip, adding fuel to the fire.Also read: Golden State Warriors star Stephen Curry surprises son Canon Curry with Mr. Beast video call in heartwarming moment With both men entrenched in their positions, the back-and-forth shows no signs of stopping.

Why was Tampa Bay Rays' shortstop Taylor Walls ejected amid play for tapping on his helmet?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/why-was-tampa-bay-rays-shortstop-taylor-walls-ejected-amid-play-for-tapping-on-his-helmet/articleshow/121565962.cms,"(Image via Getty: Taylor Walls)

Home plate umpire Nic Lentz asked Taylor Walls to stop playing because he tapped on his helmet amid play



Taylor Walls says tapping on his helmet was totally unintentional and he was not consciously aware of that

Also Read:





What does tapping on the helmet mean? That one question is creating a ruckus all over the globe right now. Tampa Bay Rays’ shortstop Taylor Walls tapped on his helmet after a play. The home plate umpire, Nic Lentz, took it as an automated ball-strike challenge system. In simple terms? Players can tap their helmets to challenge a call. But Walls did not mean that. He shared with MLB.com, “It looks like I tapped my helmet. But it was totally unintentional, something I was not consciously aware of at all.”On Sunday afternoon, in the ninth inning of Tampa Bay Rays vs Houston Astros, when Rays’ shortstop Taylor Walls was in-bat against Astros closer Josh Hader, he took a first-pitch slider. According to the official website of MLB, the first-pitch slider appeared to be just below the strike zone. But the home plate umpire, Nic Lentz, called it a strike.After that, Walls communicated with Lentz twice and said that the pitch was too low to be called a strike. He adjusted his helmet, moved two steps ahead, then looked at Nic Lentz and tapped on his helmet thrice.Nic Lentz walks up to Taylor Walls and says, “You are not going to do that.You are not going to tap your helmet.”Walls said, “I watched the video, and I could see where he may have that thought. But I think, like, the context clues around it - I’m looking at him, and my body language is saying, like, ‘Dude, I didn’t hear what you’re saying.’I didn’t say anything to him leading up to this. If I’m gonna tap my helmet, I’m not gonna do it while I’m looking at you, asking you a question, trying to understand what you’re telling me. I just remember going to get into the box, kind of adjusting my helmet, and then hearing him mouthing something.I was like, I think I said, ‘Huh, what did you say? I can’t hear you.’ And at that point - I have no recollection of it, but after seeing the video, it looks like I tapped my helmet. But it was totally unintentional, something I was not consciously aware of at all.”The 28-year-old second baseman lost his cool when Nic Lentz asked him to leave amid play. He removes his helmet, throws it to the ground, tries to threaten, comes at him, points fingers, tries to jump on him(to punch him maybe?), comes back, and screams at him angrily - but luckily, he was handled by the rest of the MLB crew on the ground.Fans reacted to FOX Sports: MLB's X post: Taylor Walls was ejected from the game after tapping his helmet. One fan wrote, ""To be fair, he didn’t get ejected for tapping his helmet, it was for what came out of his mouth. These headlines are never honest about what actually happened.""Another fan commented, ""If I recall correctly, nearly half of all batters, who get up to bat. Tap their helmet down to make sure it’s secure. If it became some other gesture. That’s just weak."" A third fan said, ""Referees are ruining sports.""A fan justified both Taylor Walls and umpire Nic Lentz actions, ""Seems that both overreacted. Umpire overreacted by ejecting Walls for simply challenging the call. Walls overreacted by his aggression towards the umpire. Two wrongs don’t make a right."" While another fan bluntly wrote, ""ump kinda had to toss him. gotta make an example outta him and show there’s basically a zero tolerance for a “tapping” taunt""Amidst everybody concentrating on how Taylor Walls' play was stopped, an X user brought their focus on Walls' play, ""Buddy is hitting .188 , settle down.""","Tampa bay rays’ shortstop taylor walls tapped on his helmet after a play.

Zaya Wade and Dwyane Wade turn a birthday into a moment of support





Zaya and Dwyane Wade speak from the heart about their bond





On the surface, it looked like a glamorous 18th birthday bash, bright lights, bold fashion, and a buzzing Hollywood venue. But behind the sparkle, Zaya Wade’s big night held a powerful secret. With just a $20 entry ticket, guests weren’t only stepping into a party, they were stepping into a movement. Just days before Pride Month, Zaya, alongside her father Dwyane Wade, revealed something far bigger than a celebration. This wasn’t just a birthday. It was a mission disguised in glitter and grace.The event was called The Venus Ascension Ball. It happened just two days before Pride Month started. The location was NeueHouse in Hollywood, California. Zaya planned the night with a clear goal. Tickets cost $20, and every dollar went to Translatable, a platform she created in 2023 with her dad, Dwyane Wade.Translatable is a digital space that supports LGBTQ+ youth. It offers tools, education, and personal stories. It helps young people feel seen and gives families guidance to support them.Many people came to the ball. Dwyane Wade was there. So was his wife, actress Gabrielle Union , and their daughter, Kaavia Wade.The family showed love and support the whole night.Big brands also helped out. MAC Cosmetics gave $100,000 to the Trans Wellness Center in Zaya’s honor. Other sponsors included H&M, the Utah Jazz, and Folx Health.The Trans Wellness Center, run by Marian Marroquin, was the nonprofit partner. It helps trans people in Los Angeles with health care, housing, and education.The party wasn’t just about raising money. It was a true ball. Guests dressed up. There were runway contests with $15,000 in cash prizes. Zaya wore a strapless beaded gown, then changed into a short lace dress. Her cake showed The Birth of Venus, a painting about beauty and new life.Zaya later said, “It was indescribable. Imagine an explosion of love and light wrapped up into one magical night.”Zaya’s family has supported her from the start. She came out as transgender in 2020, at just 12 years old. At the time, the Wades were living in Florida. But due to new laws against LGBTQ+ rights, they moved to California. Dwyane Wade said, “The community wasn’t here for Zaya, so the community wasn’t here for us.”In May 2024, Dwyane Wade shared a podcast where Zaya joined him as a guest. They talked about their close bond. Dwyane said people don’t see how much they work together.He also shared that they received the Elevate Prize Catalyst Award. This award supports their mission to helpLGBTQ+ youth. Dwyane explained that Translatable gives these young people a safe online place to connect. It also helps families learn how to support them.Zaya’s birthday looked like a party. But it was really about hope, love, and a strong mission.Also Read: Why does the NBA trophy bear Larry O’Brien’s Name?

Part of my pick then was Matthew Tkachuk, who was hurt.”The NHL legend added, “He was such a big part of the success of the Panthers, and I wasn't sure he was coming back.”Apart from this, Wayne Gretzky has mostly maintained a low profile in the last few months while Paulina Gretzky has been pretty active on social media as she enjoys her life with friends and family.Also Read: “We are going to the finals baby”: Connor McDavid's wife Lauren Kyle reacts to Oilers' Game 5 win as she posts a wholesome life update","Paulina gretzky has been married to pro golfer dustin johnson for a couple of years.

Corey Perry shuts down retirement rumors as Stanley Cup Final looms

Veteran forward wants more as he eyes free agency after playoff run





Corey Perry, one of the NHL’s most seasoned veterans, isn’t hanging up his skates just yet. As the Edmonton Oilers gear up for the Stanley Cup Final, the 40-year-old winger has silenced retirement rumors with a bold announcement. Despite nearing free agency, Perry confirmed he plans to return for a 21st season, proving he still has plenty left to give.As the Edmonton Oilers gear up for their first Stanley Cup Final appearance since 1990, veteran forward Corey Perry is already thinking ahead to what’s next—and no, it’s not retirement.Now 40 years old and in his 20th NHL season, Perry continues to defy expectations. He’s proven this postseason that he still brings tremendous value to a contending team. Despite being one of the league's oldest active players, Perry confirmed to reporters that he has “no intention of retiring just yet,” according to Chris Johnston of The Athletic. That clears up any retirement speculation—and adds intrigue to his pending free agency.Perry’s one-year deal with Edmonton will expire at the end of the 2024–25 season, setting him up to enter the unrestricted free agent market once again.While it’s unclear if the Oilers will offer a new deal, there’s no question Perry has shown he still has gas left in the tank.During the regular season, Perry skated in 81 games, notching 30 points—including 11 goals—while logging nearly 12 minutes of ice time per game. But it’s his playoff production that’s turned heads: seven goals and 10 points in 16 postseason contests, serving as a clutch performer in the team’s deep run.Though he’s no longer the nearly point-per-game player he once was during his peak with the Anaheim Ducks, Perry’s leadership and timely scoring are the kind of assets every playoff contender craves.Perry isn’t rushing his next move just yet. He remains focused on helping Edmonton capture its first Stanley Cup since 1990—a milestone that would give him his second career title, the first coming with Anaheim in 2007.Also Read: Why did Connor Bedard reject Team Canada’s World Championship invite — and what’s really behind his surprising decision? Regardless of where he lands next, Perry’s mindset is clear: he’s not done.

Poll Do you think Vanessa Bryant handled the pregnancy rumors well? Yes, very cleverly No, she should have addressed them directly





After days of unrelenting speculation, Vanessa Bryant took to Instagram Stories on Sunday, June 1, to put the rumors to rest. Her response wasn’t a press statement or a legal warning, it was a wild meme with a big middle finger to the internet trolls. The meme featured music icon Rihanna floating in water with a snorkel mask on her head, holding a drink, and flipping her middle finger.“Me protecting my peace, not pregnant & having fun all summer,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the caption on her response to the online trolls who spread her pregnancy rumors about five years after her husband, Kobe Bryant’s, untimely and devastating demise.It was clear, clever, and vintage Vanessa who shut down noise without saying a word about the origin of the gossip. No press release needed when you’ve got Rihanna energy with a direct middle finger gesture.The rumors had emerged out of nowhere, with some users pointing to photos allegedly showing a ""baby bump,"" though no timestamps or context were attached to those images. Vanessa hasn't been publicly linked to anyone romantically, and there’s been zero confirmation from her side—until now.Also Read: Is Vanessa Bryant pregnant with her 5th child? The Internet speculates about her relationship with rumoured BF In another Instagram Story later that evening, Vanessa shared a motivational quote that hinted at how she views the entire situation and what matters to her personally.“The only way to impress me, is by being a good person,” the quote read. “I don’t care what you have, what you wear, where you live, or what you drive. I just have deep respect for people with pure hearts and good intentions.”Adding one final touch to her trilogy of clapbacks, she posted another Rihanna meme, this one stating, “I’m not mean, I’m just not the one.”Vanessa, who shares four daughters with Kobe— Natalia, Bianka, Capri, and the late Gianna— has remained devoted to family and philanthropy. Most recently, she shared footage of a joyful family ski trip over the holidays, showing the tight-knit bond she maintains with her children.Vanessa and Kobe Bryant tied the knot in April 2001. Tragically, in January 2020, Kobe and their 13-year-old daughter Gianna lost their lives in a helicopter crash that also killed seven others. They were headed to Kobe’s Mamba Sports Academy for a youth basketball game when the accident occurred. Kobe was 41 at the time. The loss shook the sports world and left a lasting impact on fans, friends, and loved ones across the globe.Since their passing, she’s kept their memory alive through meaningful business ventures and charitable work. Kobe launched the Mamba Sports Foundation in 2016, aiming to support young athletes. After his death, Vanessa renamed it the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation in honor of both Kobe and Gianna. Today, the foundation helps underserved boys and girls in sports, pushing forward the mission they believed in. It's her way of carrying on their legacy with purpose and heart.Vanessa Bryant’s response was indeed witty and empowering as she hinted that she deserves privacy and reminded the world that while she may be a public figure, her peace and dignity aren’t up for debate, especially not over unfounded gossip.","Vanessa bryant addressed her pregnancy rumors in a wild instagram story.

The Indiana Pacers face a major threat heading into Game 1 of the NBA Finals against the Oklahoma City Thunder

2001 Lakers (-2000): With Shaq and Kobe in their prime, L.A. rolled through the playoffs 15-1, dominating the Sixers and claiming the title with ease.



2018 Warriors (-1075): Kevin Durant and company dismantled the Cavaliers in a clean 4-0 sweep.

1996 Bulls (-950): Michael Jordan’s record-setting 72-win team beat the Sonics in six games, cementing their dynasty.



2000 Lakers (-800): Shaq averaged a staggering 38 points per game as they defeated—ironically—the Indiana Pacers in six games.



2004 Lakers (-700): Despite a superteam lineup, they were shocked by the Pistons in a stunning 4-1 upset.

1986 Celtics (-700): Bird, McHale, and Parish outmatched the Rockets for a dominant win.







As the Indiana Pacers prepare for their first NBA Finals appearance in nearly a quarter-century, one unexpected challenge has emerged before even stepping onto the hardwood: the favorite and the odds. Additionally, Tyrese Haliburton and his squad, fresh off a playoff run full of upsets, find themselves battling delays caused by severe thunderstorms and tornado warnings that disrupted their travel to Game 1. In a series already stacked against them, Mother Nature has joined the opposition.Led by MVP Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the Oklahoma City Thunder finished the season with a 68-14 record, one of the best in league history, and entered the NBA Finals as colossal -700 favorites, according to Yahoo Sports.The numbers place them among the most heavily favored teams in Finals history. To put things in perspective, consider these iconic comparisons—That last outlier, the 2004 Lakers, serves as a cautionary tale. Favorites don’t always finish the job, and this underdog Pacers team, led by Haliburton, is built to break narratives as they have so far in the playoffs.But the odds aren’t the only thunderous hurdle looming over the Pacers.According to Fieldhouse Files reporter Scott Agness, severe weather caused a major delay in Indiana’s flight to Oklahoma City.“According to flight data, the plane landed at Will Rogers International Airport at 7:58 p.m. ET — five hours after takeoff, about twice as long as the expected flight time,” Agness reported.While the Pacers are expected to hold practices before each Finals game, the extended travel time and turbulent arrival are far from ideal.

NEW DELHI After 18 long years of near misses and heartbreaks, Virat Kohli finally led Royal Challengers Bengaluru to their first-ever Indian Premier League title, sealing a tense six-run victory over Punjab Kings in a pulsating final at the Narendra Modi Stadium on Tuesday night.As the last ball was bowled and victory was confirmed, Kohli’s emotions overflowed. Tears streamed down his face as he hugged his wife, Anushka Sharma , and placed a kiss on her forehead to mark his happiness.Speaking to broadcasters, Kohli also credited Anushka for the role she played in his IPL-winning moment that came after 18 years.""Watching us just miss out. What your life partner does for you to be able to play — the sacrifices, the commitment, and just backing you through thick and thin — is something you can’t explain in words,"" Kohli said.""Only when you play professionally do you understand the many things that go on behind the scenes and what they go through as well. What Anushka has gone through emotionally — watching me being down and out, coming to games, being so connected with Bangalore (she’s a Bangalore girl as well), and being connected to RCB — this is very, very special for her, and she’s going to be so, so proud. Thank you,"" he added.Kohli remains a firm advocate for Test cricket, once again expressing his opinion about youngsters playing the longest format after Royal Challengers Bengaluru ended their 18-year-long drought to win the IPL title.Kohli announced his retirement during the 2025 IPL season and will not be part of the side facing England for five Test matches over the next two months. His last appearance in the format came against Australia in the Border Gavaskar Trophy 2024/25.Kohli believes there is nothing more important than playing Test cricket and said that only after performing in the longest format will the world truly respect a player for his game.“You know, this moment is right up there with the best moments I've had in my career. But it still marks five levels under Test cricket. That's how much I value Test cricket. And that's how much I love Test cricket.""So I would just urge the youngsters coming through, to treat that format with respect. Because if you perform in Test cricket, you walk around anywhere in the world, people look you in the eye and shake your hand and say, 'Well done, you played the game really well'. So if you want to earn respect in world cricket all over, take up Test cricket, and give your heart and soul to it. And when you walk out with wonders on the other side, then you gain respect to the cricket world with legends like yourself melting our hearts on the field and off the field,"" Kohli said on Tuesday.Kohli bid adieu to his Test career with 9,230 runs in 123 matches at an impressive average of 46.85, including 30 centuries and 31 half-centuries. He wrapped up his Test career as the fourth-most successful Test captain overall with 40 wins, behind Graeme Smith (53 wins), Ricky Ponting (48 wins), and Steve Waugh (41 wins). He also holds the record for the most Test hundreds by an Indian captain, with 20 tons — far ahead of Sunil Gavaskar’s 11 centuries.",Royal challengers bengaluru won their first-ever indian premier league title on tuesday.

IPL 2025 Final, RCB vs Punjab Kings: The wait will finally end in Ahmedabad

Check some reactions here:





NEW DELHI: The pressure ahead of the IPL 2025 final between Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Punjab Kings was palpable — not just on the players, but also on fans, broadcasters, and everyone involved. And it seems even former India cricketer Ravi Shastri wasn’t immune to the nerves.Arriving as the presenter for the toss at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Tuesday, the ex-Team India coach and veteran commentator made a major blunder during the live broadcast.After Punjab Kings skipper Shreyas Iyer won the toss and elected to bowl first, Shastri conducted the post-toss interviews with both captains. But once Shreyas and RCB captain Rajat Patidar walked away, Shastri made a glaring error on air — he announced that Iyer had chosen to bat, even acting it out with a classic front-foot defensive stroke gesture.The goof-up didn’t go unnoticed. Within minutes, fans lit up social media, triggering a meme fest poking fun at Shastri’s comical mix-up on live television.Punjab Kings captain Shreyas Iyer won the toss and elected to bowl first against Royal Challengers Bengaluru.With both teams hoping to win their maiden title in the league, the team managements decided to go in with the tried and trusted and remain unchanged for the final.RCB have decided to go ahead without Tim David, who had missed their last two matches with an injury.On the biggest occasion for the franchise, PBKS skipper Shreyas Iyer said his players are in a good mindset and will play it like a final.""I want to give positive signs to my mind and body. I feel it's an amazing day, here at the moment. Crowd here is electrifying, just want to cherish it. Boys in a brilliant mindset,"" he said at the toss.Asked what they discussed in the pre-match meeting, Iyer said, ""All we talked about in the meeting was about how keeping calm gives the best results. That's been the message throughout. We hope to embrace the occasion. I'm absolutely fine. We're gonna play it like a final. Have envisioned lifting the trophy.""RCB skipper Rajat Patidar said they would have also liked to bowl first on this wicket.""We also wanted to bowl. Surface looks hard. Will try to put on a good total. Till now we've played well, it's just another game for us. We'll give it our best.""It's a big stage but it's just another away game for us. Everyone's played well till now, will try to do the same now. Same team. Looks a good pitch, flat, mix of red and black soil. Should be good to bat,"" said Patidar.The match will be played on pitch number six which is a 25% black soil and 75% red soil surface.

Dallas Stars’ coach, Pete DeBoer, has made players uncomfortable with his controversial decision in Game 5 against the Edmonton Oilers







The Dallas Stars faced a devastating loss against the Edmonton Oilers in the 2025 Stanley Cup Playoffs Western Conference Final and lost their entry to the Stanley Cup Finals. But now, it seems like the Dallas Stars’ head coach, Pete DeBoer, has run into trouble after he made a controversial move of pulling out the team’s goaltender, Jake Oettinger.Recently, NHL insider and The Fourth Period’s David Pagnotta made a post on what has been happening behind the scenes.David Pagnotta’s recent post on X reads as, “Noise out of Dallas re: Pete DeBoer. Per multiple sources, players are not pleased with how he handled several situations during the WCF, along with post Gm5 & exit media remarks. Told players voiced concerns during internal exit interviews. DeBoer has 1yr left on his contract” and fans agree with this take.A fan commented, “Should be fired just based on pulling Oettinger so dam early in a do or die match”, while another fan wrote, “Knew I wasn’t the only one that wasn’t a fan of DeBoer. How he treated Otter was unacceptable.”A third fan posted, “This was my first thought after the missteps from DeBoer. Players are not going to like the way he went about this, and I think it’ll be difficult for them to move past that”, while another user wrote, “don't mess with my goalie also applies to the head coach.”A fifth fan noted, “DeBoer was already on the hot seat before the Oettinger comments - that was just a desperation play. Still hard to grasp what he was thinking, though. If he stays, the room resents him. If he’s fired, future teams & players will remember how he threw his goalie under the bus.”For the unversed, a few days ago, in Game 5 against the Edmonton Oilers, Jake Oettinger was pulled out of the game just minutes into the first round.Jake Oettinger even spoke about it after the game and said, “I wasn’t expecting that to happen. It was surprising. But the reality is, if I make one or two of those saves, I’d still (be playing) in the game.”An official confirmation about Pete DeBoer’s situation with the team is awaited.Also Read: “It’ll most likely be my last one”: Florida Panthers’ Brad Marchand opens up ahead of Stanley Cup Final against the Edmonton Oilers","Dallas stars’ coach, pete deboer, has made players uncomfortable with his controversial decision in game 5 against the edmonton oilers.

Controversy around the Imane Khelif’s gold medal at Paris Olympic



IOC calls findings misinformation



Response of World Boxing

Fairness and safety concerns from athletes and federations



Ongoing debate on gender and sport eligibility





A leaked medical report from the 2023 World Championships has revealed that Olympic boxing champion Imane Khelif is biologically male, according to chromosome analysis. The report, made public just days after World Boxing ordered Khelif to undergo sex testing for eligibility in future female competitions, shows she has a male XY karyotype. This revelation challenges the International Olympic Committee’s (IOC) earlier dismissal of such tests and has intensified debate over fairness and safety in women’s boxing. The findings come amid ongoing controversy surrounding Khelif’s participation in women’s events, sparking calls for stricter verification procedures in sport.The report, published on the 3 Wire Sports website, states that Khelif’s chromosome analysis is “abnormal” and confirms a male karyotype. It was conducted by Dr Lal PathLabs in New Delhi, a lab accredited by the American College of Pathologists and certified by the International Organisation for Standardisation. This directly challenges the IOC’s spokesperson Mark Adams, who had described such test results as “ad hoc” and “not legitimate” during a press conference at the Paris Olympics.The controversy surrounding Imane Khelif’s Olympic gold medal run began as early as her first bout in Paris, where she faced Italy’s Angela Carini.Carini, an experienced and respected boxer, was visibly shaken during the match. Overwhelmed by Khelif’s strength and intensity, she appeared distressed and left the ring in tears after the fight, later telling media she had feared for her safety. The unease only deepened in the final bout, where Khelif defeated Taiwan’s Lin Yu-ting in a dominant display that many felt was physically one-sided. The power difference between the fighters drew sharp criticism, with commentators and athletes calling it “uncomfortable to watch” and likening it to watching a man beat a woman in the ring. The moment became one of the most controversial of the Paris Games, fuelling an international debate over fairness and inclusion in women’s sport.IOC president Thomas Bach dismissed the report as part of a Russian-led misinformation campaign, citing ethical and financial issues within the International Boxing Association (IBA), which conducted the tests. Despite these claims, the legitimacy of the Indian lab’s certification has increased pressure on the IOC to clarify its position and respond to questions about Khelif’s eligibility.Following the leak, World Boxing has declared that Khelif must pass mandatory chromosome testing before competing in any future female events. The 26-year-old Olympic champion, who was allowed to compete in Paris due to her female passport status, has so far not provided evidence to confirm female chromosomes. World Boxing now requires all athletes over 18 in its competitions to undergo PCR genetic testing to verify their sex, a measure introduced in response to this controversy.The case has raised serious safety and fairness concerns within the boxing community. Opponents like Italy’s Angela Carini and Mexico’s Brianda Tamara have spoken out about the physical challenges they faced competing against Khelif. Latin American federations have been particularly vocal, urging that women’s competitions be restricted to athletes assigned female at birth, in order to protect fairness and athlete safety.The Khelif controversy highlights the complex and sensitive issues surrounding transgender and intersex athletes in competitive sport. It underscores the need for clear, consistent policies that balance inclusivity with fairness and safety. As governing bodies reassess their rules, the case remains a key example of the challenges faced in maintaining the integrity of women’s sports.The ongoing debate around Imane Khelif’s case brings to light just how complex and emotionally charged the conversation about gender and eligibility in sport has become. At the heart of it are real athletes — women who train for years and step into the ring expecting fairness. Many feel blindsided and unheard when competing against opponents whose physical attributes raise legitimate concerns about safety and equality. This isn’t about exclusion, but about protecting hard-won opportunities for women in sport. Khelif’s story reminds us that governing bodies must act transparently, thoughtfully, and with empathy for all athletes involved.",Imane khelif ’s medical report contradicts ioc’s official position.
