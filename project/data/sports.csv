India‚Äôs U-19 team wrapped up their one-day tour in England on a disappointing note, falling to a dominant seven-wicket defeat in the fifth and final Youth ODI on Monday.Despite the loss, all eyes remained on 14-year-old sensation Vaibhav Suryavanshi, who scored a fighting 33, keeping fans intrigued after his record-breaking hundred earlier in the series.Having already sealed the five-match series 3-1 with a commanding 55-run win in the fourth ODI, India rested key players and shuffled the lineup. But their batting faltered after electing to bat first in Worcester.Skipper Ayush Mhatre (1) and Vihaan Malhotra (1) fell cheaply within the first three overs, leaving India tottering at 9 for 2.Suryavanshi then stepped up with a composed 33 off 42 balls, striking three fours and two sixes.He stitched together a vital 51-run stand with Rahul Kumar (21) that helped stabilise the innings briefly. However, Suryavanshi perished trying to accelerate, caught by Alex Green off Sebastian Morgan.Middle-order batters struggled to convert starts, with Harvnash Pangalia (24), Kanishk Chauhan (24), and Deepesh Devendran (0) falling in quick succession.RS Ambrish was the lone standout, scoring a resilient 66 off 81 balls, anchoring the innings with six boundaries.India eventually posted 210 for 9 in their 50 overs, a total that proved inadequate on a batting-friendly surface.In reply, England made light work of the chase. Ben Mayes led the charge with an unbeaten 82, supported by BJ Dawkins‚Äôs explosive 66 and skipper Thomas Rew‚Äôs unbeaten 49 off just 37 balls.England reached the target in just 31.1 overs, winning with 113 balls to spare.Naman Pushpak took 2 wickets for India, but the visitors were thoroughly outplayed as England ended the series on a high note.","India's u-19 team lost to england in the fifth and final youth odi in worcester.

The Dallas Cowboys are known for big plays and strong defense, but something changed last season. As the 2025 NFL season gets closer, fans are still asking what went wrong. One big name from the league has shared a surprising take, and it points to a deeper issue than just lost games or injured players.In a recent interview, former NFL head coach Jon Gruden shared his thoughts on the Dallas Cowboys defense. He said that without Dan Quinn, the team lost its identity. Quinn, who coached the defense until early 2024, helped create a strong and disciplined group. Since his departure, Gruden believes that structure is gone.Gruden made it clear:He also pointed out the absence of veteran DeMarcus Lawrence and the injury of linebacker DeMarvion Overshown. With both players missing, leadership and energy are lacking. The Cowboys finished the 2024 season ranked 28th in overall defense, a shocking drop for a team that once dominated.Now, Micah Parsons remains the team‚Äôs top defensive star. But as Gruden noted, one player can‚Äôt carry the entire unit. Parsons is talented, but leadership needs to come from more than one voice.After Mike McCarthy was fired as head coach, the Cowboys hired Brian Schottenheimer to take over.Matt Eberflus stepped in as the new defensive coordinator.

Brad Marchand‚Äôs decision affects Toronto‚Äôs trade urgency



The NHL offseason has shaken up the Toronto Maple Leafs. Following the trade of star forward Mitch Marner to the Vegas Golden Knights, the pressure has mounted on Auston Matthews and the front office to make up for the void. Although the Maple Leafs failed in their reported attempt to acquire veteran Brad Marchand during free agency, their focus remains locked on the Florida Panthers roster.Toronto‚Äôs interest is practical. The team seeks a playoff-proven forward to reinforce their top-six rotation. Rodrigues, known for his two-way reliability and postseason experience, would offer exactly that. And for a team still reeling from the loss of Marner‚Äôs speed, vision, and chemistry with Matthews, his addition could help steady the ship heading into the new season.While the Maple Leafs are active suitors, they are far from the only ones. The Chicago Blackhawks, Detroit Red Wings, and Minnesota Wild are also reportedly in the mix for Rodrigues‚Äô services. Unlike Toronto, those three clubs play in the Western Conference, a factor that may sway Florida‚Äôs preference when choosing a trade partner.Evan Rodrigues‚Äô trade could follow the same pattern. While his value is recognized across the league, his departure would serve a dual purpose: relieving the cap and avoiding strengthening a direct Eastern Conference rival.For Toronto, this presents a critical challenge. Convincing Florida to part with Rodrigues; without overpaying; may be their toughest task yet.Brad Marchand choosing to stay in Florida, rather than test free agency, may have added urgency to Toronto‚Äôs pursuit of Rodrigues. The Maple Leafs were reportedly interested in bringing in Marchand‚Äôs experience and leadership, but that window closed quickly. Marchand remains part of Florida‚Äôs championship core, a decision that reinforces Toronto‚Äôs need to look deeper into the Panthers‚Äô roster for realistic options.As the NHL offseason continues, the Maple Leafs‚Äô path forward hinges on whether they can outmaneuver rival teams and land a player who might not replace Mitch Marner, but can at least help stabilize a shaken core. Florida, on the other hand, must decide whether the cost of aiding a potential rival is worth the financial relief.Also Read: Former NHL enforcer Nick Tarnasky destroys drunk man in wild viral golf course brawl","Evan rodrigues is a two-way forward who plays for the florida panthers.

Eric Mangini questions whether Travis Hunter can play WR and CB in the NFL



Teams can tire Travis Hunter out, Tua's No. 91 ranking in Top 100 is ""too high"" | FIRST THINGS FIRST

Travis Hunter's dream of being the first full-time two-way player in the NFL in decades has been called into question by some of the sport's veteran statesmen, including former New York Jets and Cleveland Browns coach Eric Mangini. The Jacksonville Jaguars drafted a rookie wide receiver and cornerback mesmerized by his two-way play at the University of Colorado. But Eric Mangini thinks the grind of the pro game could be too much even for a talent as unusual as Travis Hunter's.Travis Hunter made headlines last year playing with the Colorado Buffaloes and their head coach, Deion Sanders. He took an eye-popping 118 snaps a game, playing leading roles on offense and defense and making a serious bid for the Heisman Trophy. The Jacksonville Jaguars are now counting on his unusual skill set to remake their roster and play him at both wide receiver and cornerback. That move might not be as smooth, though.""He's shown that he's built different, but there's a significant difference between college football and the NFL,"" said Eric Mangini.""You're adding the five games plus whatever you're playing in the preseason. The quality of players you're playing against is good every week.""On the Breakfast Ball podcast, Mangini outlined why that might not work:‚ÄúI don‚Äôt think that plan is necessarily going to work,‚Äù said Mangini. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs one of those things where, okay, if Travis Hunter is covering their best receiver, you‚Äôre going to tell your best receiver, ‚ÄòHey, go run a go route all day. You‚Äôre a decoy. We‚Äôre not going to throw you the ball.‚Äô You‚Äôre not going to know where he‚Äôs going to be defensively.‚ÄùIn the meantime, the Jacksonville Jaguars are slowly acclimating Travis Hunter to the pro pace. In OTAs, he lined up nearly exclusively as a wide receiver, with few reps at corner. That could be part of a building-once-you-get-there plan‚Äîor an indicator of how the Jaguars plan to utilize him in the near term.Also read: Travis Kelce‚Äôs performance questioned as Eric Mangini cites his relationship with Taylor Swift Travis Hunter‚Äôs NFL journey will be closely watched, not just for his undeniable athleticism, but also for the way he challenges traditional roles in professional football.",Eric mangini questions whether travis hunter can play wr and cb in the nfl.

Why did Calvin Ridley miss playing football most of his senior year?

Calvin Ridley is set to enter his second season as the lead wide receiver for the Tennessee Titans. Despite an inconsistent first season, he did manage to prove his mettle and became the ninth player in NFL history to have a 1,000-yard season with three different NFL teams.Calvin Ridley‚Äôs journey to NFL stardom wasn‚Äôt without some early roadblocks. One of his most unexpected came during his senior year of high school, when a technicality left him sidelined for much of the football season.Calvin Ridley was born on December 20, 1994 and was older than most of his classmates in school. By the time his senior season at Monarch High School in Coconut Creek, Florida, rolled around, he was already 20 years old.Unfortunately, Florida High School Athletic Association (FHSAA) rules strictly prohibit anyone over the age of 19 years and 8 months from participating in high school athletics. And Ridley was declared ineligible for most of his final year of high school football.It was no doubt a crushing blow to the young athlete. In high school football, missing an entire senior season meant Ridley had limited scope for college recruiters to evaluate, and far fewer chances to prove himself in front of scouts.But it goes without saying that Ridley‚Äôs talent was impossible to ignore.Even with limited playing time, he had already made a strong impression, especially with his speed and sharp route running. Ridley eventually committed to the University of Alabama, where he quickly became a star and helped them win a national championship and earning All-SEC honors.","Calvin ridley is set to enter his second season as the lead wide receiver for the tennessee titans.

Divided fan reactions: was O‚ÄôReilly the safer long-term bet?

Desperation or strategy? The high-stakes gamble to end the drought

The Edmonton Oilers are done waiting. After two gut-wrenching Stanley Cup Final losses, the franchise has made it clear they‚Äôre pushing all their chips in for a win-now run‚Äîstarting with the controversial acquisition of college star Isaac Howard. The trade, which sent top prospect Sam O‚ÄôReilly to the Tampa Bay Lightning, has ignited a passionate divide among fans and analysts alike.Howard, the 2025 Hobey Baker Award winner, lit up the NCAA last season with 52 points in 37 games for Michigan State. Yet for the 21-year-old forward, individual accolades weren‚Äôt the priority. ‚ÄúI want to win a national championship. I didn‚Äôt play to win a Hobey,‚Äù he told NHL.com. That drive may have been exactly what the Oilers needed to see.NHL insider Frank Seravalli reported that Edmonton believes Howard is ready to make their opening night lineup, calling the move ‚Äúfascinating.‚ÄùAnd that‚Äôs where things get complicated.While Howard‚Äôs credentials are impressive, so were O‚ÄôReilly‚Äôs. The 19-year-old center, drafted 32nd overall by Edmonton in 2024, racked up 71 points in the OHL with the London Knights. Some fans questioned the logic of trading a right-shooting center over a smaller winger. ‚ÄúO‚ÄôReilly could have been our Lundell,‚Äù one Oilers supporter argued, referencing Florida Panthers standout Anton Lundell. ‚ÄúHoward?
