Shubman Gill ruled out of South Africa ODIs; three captaincy candidates emerge

Poll How do you feel about KL Rahul being appointed as the captain for the upcoming ODI series against South Africa? Excited Indifferent Concerned Disappointed

India’s ODI squad:

India have announced their squad for the three ODIs against South Africa, and as expected, KL Rahul will lead the side in the series starting November 30.In a notable development, Axar Patel has not been included, while Ravindra Jadeja returns to the ODI mix after being dropped for the series against Australia. The other surprising omission from the squad is Varun Chakravarthy, who was India’s trump card in the Champions Trophy.Ashad first reported on November 22 , regular captain Shubman Gill wasn’t available due to a neck injury, Hardik Pandya is yet to regain match fitness, and Jasprit Bumrah has been rested for the series. Tilak Varma’s addition to the middle order is a sign of things to come, as the team management is keen to inject more left-handers into the middle order.India have had a very right-hand–dominated ODI batting order, and in the build-up to the 2027 ODI World Cup, different combinations will be tried. Tilak and Rishabh Pant could get their chances in the upcoming fixtures, as Shreyas Iyer’s injury allows the think tank to explore all options before the vice-captain regains match fitness.The biggest talking point, however, remains Jadeja over Axar Patel. Not too long ago, the men’s senior selection committee led by Ajit Agarkar had ignored Jadeja for the ODI series in Australia.Agarkar had explained why there was no need for an extra left-arm spinner and clearly indicated that Axar was ahead of Jadeja in the format.“He is very much in the plans. But there will be some competition for places. Of course, he was there in the Champions Trophy squad because we took those extra spinners with the conditions there. At the moment, we could only carry one and get some balance in the team with Washi and Kuldeep there as well. And I don’t think we are going to need more than that in Australia,” Agarkar had said.Axar picked up three wickets in as many games and made contributions of 31 and 44 in the two opportunities with the bat but didn’t make the 15-member squad for the three games against South Africa.Veteran speedster Mohammed Shami continues to be ignored, even after proving his match fitness in the domestic circuit, as selectors have stuck with the likes of Harshit Rana, Prasidh Krishna and Arshdeep Singh. Mohammed Siraj also seems to have been rested for the series.Rohit Sharma, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Virat Kohli, Tilak Varma, KL Rahul (C) (wk), Rishabh Pant (wk), Washington Sundar, Ravindra Jadeja, Kuldeep Yadav, Nitish Kumar Reddy, Harshit Rana, Ruturaj Gaikwad, Prasidh Krishna, Arshdeep Singh, Dhruv Jurel","India have announced their squad for the three odis against south africa.

IAF Officer Namansh Syal Flown Back to India After Tejas Jet Crash in Dubai Air Show

'It was uncomfortable for me'





Captain Taylor Hiester, a pilot of the US F-16 team who was at the Dubai Air Show where a Tejas fighter jet crashed, killing Wing Commander Namansh Syal, expressed his disbelief and shock that the show was not cancelled even after the tragic event. Hiester said their team was preparing their show when the accident took place. The event was not called off despite the tragedy but the US team and a few other decided to cancel their performance out of respect to the pilot and his colleagues and family.As he headed to the US, he shared his emotions which were a mix of shock and discomfort as he also slammed the organisers for going on with the show.""After two years of doing this job, that was a first for our team and it came just before our final performance of the season. Together and individually, we all quietly watched the aftermath unfold from a distance thinking about the Indian maintenance crew standing on the ramp next to an empty parking spot, aircraft ladder laid on the ground, the pilot's belongings still in his rental car,"" Hiester wrote.Hiester recounted that after the fire was put out, the organisers notified the participants that the display would continue. Their team left but he returned to the site an hour or two later hoping that he would find an empty space.But to his disappointment, the announcer was still enthusiastic and people were watching the show.Hiester said the moment was uncomfortable for him as he imagined his team walking out of the show without him and other participants preparing for their performance. ""I was shaken awake by this truth -- despite whatever guise, whatever 'rockstar treatment', fancy dinners and sponsor chlets, my team who became my family is all I ever had in the first place.""Questioning the concept of 'the show must go on', Hiester said it is true that the show must go on but everyone should remember that the show will go one when they are gone too.",Us f-16 pilot taylor hiester expressed shock that the dubai air show continued even after tejas crash.

More NFL coverage

Kansas City fans are bracing for a pivotal showdown as Patrick Mahomes and the Chiefs return to Arrowhead Stadium to face the Indianapolis Colts. After back-to-back road losses to the Bills and Broncos, Mahomes knows the margin for error has vanished. The team (5‑5) needs a win to keep its AFC playoff hopes alive, and all eyes are on the three-time Super Bowl MVP to bounce back. Beyond the pressure of the field, Mahomes also found moments of personal joy, giving fans a glimpse into life outside football.Off the field, Mahomes spent Friday evening with his wife, Brittany, enjoying a rare night out before the high-stakes matchup. Brittany shared several updates on Instagram, spotlighting her red leather outfit for dinner at 1587 Prime, the Kansas City steakhouse Mahomes opened with Travis Kelce earlier this year. The posts allowed followers to see a different side of the quarterback, one grounded in family, love, and life beyond the playbook.In one post, Brittany drew attention to a small detail in her outfit, writing, “1587 & a cute bow,” with her back turned to the camera. She later shared a black-and-white photo giving her 2.1 million followers a clear look at the front of her ensemble. 1587 Prime has become a hotspot for Chiefs players and NFL personalities alike, with Travis Kelce and his fiancee, Taylor Swift, among the frequent guests.The restaurant honors both Mahomes’ No. 15 and Kelce’s No. 87, and even offers signature cocktails inspired by their partners.Patrick Mahomes didn’t appear in Brittany’s Friday night posts, but she gave him a nod earlier in the day for his thoughtful gesture. A bouquet of “just because flowers” from her high school sweetheart appeared on her Instagram story with the caption, “@patrickmahomes you are the best ever.” Moments like these show a couple enjoying each other’s company and staying grounded, even amid the demands of the NFL season.Last week, Patrick and Brittany Mahomes took part in a light-hearted promotion with CommunityAmerica Credit Union where they painted portraits of each other. Patrick warned that he wasn’t much of an artist, and Brittany’s reaction proved it. She laughed when she saw the portrait he made of her, joking about how he drew her teeth and pointing out the big eyelashes he added. Patrick, meanwhile, complimented Brittany’s drawing of him, saying it actually looked like him.As the Chiefs prepare to take on the Colts, the Mahomes pair brings off-field positivity into a high-pressure weekend. Brittany’s style, their shared moments, and Patrick’s focus on bouncing back all contribute to the narrative heading into a crucial home game. Fans will be watching to see if that energy translates to a strong performance on the field and another stylish appearance from Brittany during gameday.","Patrick mahomes and his wife, brittany, enjoyed a rare night out on friday.

How “Tweaker” Became a Cultural Phenomenon

GELO - Tweaker (Official Video)

Tweaker's Chart Domination and Viral Impact on Fans

How LiAngelo Ball Went From Basketball to Music Trailblazer

LiAngelo Ball’s transformation from overlooked basketball prospect to music industry headliner has officially reached a historic milestone. His debut single “Tweaker,” released under the stage name Gelo, has achieved platinum status - an achievement that puts him in the same conversation as heavyweight artists like Drake . For an athlete-turned-musician, this level of success is both unprecedented and culturally significant, signaling a genuine crossover moment that few have ever achieved.In addition to redefining LiAngelo's public persona, this achievement represents the pinnacle of a swift ascent that started in early 2025. LiAngelo, a musician who was frequently overshadowed by his brothers Lonzo and LaMelo Ball, has carved out a whole new path, demonstrating that his musical drive and artistic intuition were much more than a curiosity.Released in January 2025, “Tweaker” exploded online almost instantly. Its nostalgic, bouncy beat - powered by piano, organ keys, and lush synth pads - captured the spirit of early-2000s hip-hop. Paired with Gelo’s melodic, sing-song delivery and a catchy “whoa” hook reminiscent of Big Tymers-era anthems, the track resonated widely. Produced by Kunica and Glockie Cheez, the song painted a picture of luxury, swagger, and newfound fame, creating an irresistible vibe that appealed to both younger listeners and fans of classic hip-hop aesthetics.The song's momentum grew even more when it gained popularity in sports culture. When NBA and NFL teams like the Detroit Lions, Chicago Bulls, and Cleveland Cavaliers started using ""Tweaker"" as a happy anthem in locker rooms and warm-up routines, it quickly gained popularity outside of the usual music circles.The success of “Tweaker” eventually led to a massive $13 million record deal with Def Jam and Universal Music Group. The contract included an extraordinary $8 million guaranteed signing bonus—more than what many current NBA players earn annually. This landmark deal solidified Gelo’s credibility and marketability within the hip-hop and R&B world.A well-known remix with Lil Wayne gave the song even more momentum and the endorsement of one of the biggest names in rap.“Tweaker” made history by reaching No. 1 on the US Rhythmic Billboard chart - an exceptional feat for a debut single from a former basketball player. The song sparked viral dance trends across social platforms and earned praise from artists like T-Pain, Lil Yachty, and Joe Budden. Its appeal spanned music, sports, and online culture, cementing LiAngelo Ball as 2025’s breakout music star.Before rising to prominence in the music industry, LiAngelo Ball spent years navigating the NBA G-League and international basketball leagues. Eventually, he gave up the sport entirely, a decision that was validated by his outstanding achievements. His debut album League of My Own, which was released in July 2025, showcased his growth as a musician and cemented his place in the industry.Also read: Angel Reese responds with 4-word message after her name is dragged into viral NBA courtside altercation LiAngelo Ball's platinum achievement for ""Tweaker"" is a significant cultural event rather than only a personal victory.

The highly anticipated wedding of Indian cricket star Smriti Mandhana and music composer-filmmaker Palash Muchhal, originally scheduled for this Sunday in Sangli, has been postponed indefinitely.Mandhana’s manager, Tuhin Mishra, confirmed that the decision came after her father, Shriniwas Mandhana, fell unwell.“This morning, while having breakfast, Smriti’s father suddenly felt unwell.

Will Aaron Rodgers play against Bears?



The Pittsburgh Steelers enter Week 12 carrying both momentum and uncertainty. Aaron Rodgers has been officially listed as questionable on Mike Tomlin’s final injury report before the game between the Pittsburgh Steelers and the Chicago Bears. His left wrist fracture has kept fans guessing all week, and the tension has only grown as kickoff inches closer. Last weekend, he planned to return against the Cincinnati Bengals, but team doctors stepped in and stopped him. That moment changed everything for the Steelers’ immediate future.Mason Rudolph stepped in and turned an uneasy situation into a statement win. His sharp command powered a 34-12 victory at Acrisure Stadium, giving Pittsburgh confidence. Still, the central question now is whether Rodgers will be ready to return to Soldier Field or if the Super Bowl champion quarterback will wait one more week.Aaron Rodgers is listed as questionable, which means Sunday’s decision sits in the hands of doctors and Mike Tomlin. A report from Tom Pelissero revealed that Rodgers has pushed to play, but medical staff warned that one bad hit could cause a displaced fracture and keep him out for the rest of the season. Tomlin kept his stance steady, saying, “We’ll see where the weekend leads us.”The quarterback did not practice on Wednesday but returned in a limited capacity on Thursday and Friday.He wore a brace at practice to support the small fracture in his non throwing wrist. The wrap allowed him to catch shotgun snaps and hold the ball in one hand. His availability depends on how well that brace protects the injury and whether he can function with it during live action.If Rodgers cannot suit up, Mason Rudolph will take the field again. Rudolph completed 12 of 16 passes for 127 yards and a touchdown in last week’s win, earning a 118.5 passer rating. Meanwhile, the Steelers expect Cam Heyward and Darius Slay back from injury, which strengthens their defensive outlook in Chicago.The Bears are preparing for their eighth win in nine games and hoping to shake off years of frustration against Rodgers. His career record against Chicago stands at 25-5, and he has not played at Soldier Field since 2022. With Rodgers saying he is “pretty sure” this will be his final season, Sunday could mark his last trip to one of his most memorable stages if he is cleared in time.Also Read: Bill Belichick caught in family firestorm after Jen Belichick’s heated rant targeting girlfriend Jordon Hudson post-UNC game","Aaron rodgers is listed as questionable for sunday's game against the chicago bears.

Palash Muchhal Proposes Cricketer Smriti Mandhana At DY Patil Stadium!

Vice-captain Smriti Mandhana , one of India’s most celebrated and consistent women cricketers, is all set to marry music composer Palash Muchhal on November 23. The engagement itself was nothing short of cinematic: Palash proposed to Smriti at Mumbai’s DY Patil Stadium, the very venue where India clinched the Women’s World Cup earlier this month. Fans are now curious not just about their love story but also about the combined wealth of this power couple.Smriti’s earnings on the cricket field are substantial. She holds a Grade A contract with the BCCI , which comes with an annual retainer of Rs 50 lakh. On top of that, she receives match fees for every international appearance: Rs 15 lakh per Test, Rs 6 lakh per ODI, and Rs 3 lakh per T20I. Coupled with her growing list of endorsements and Women’s Premier League income, her net worth is estimated at around Rs 34 crore.The Women’s Premier League has been a major boost for Smriti’s finances. During the inaugural WPL auction, Royal Challengers Bengaluru acquired her for Rs 3.4 crore per season, making her one of the highest-paid female cricketers globally. Leading RCB to a WPL title further enhanced her brand value, reportedly increasing it by nearly 30%.Smriti’s brand endorsements add significantly to her wealth. Over the years, she has collaborated with major brands including Hyundai, Hero Motocorp, Red Bull, Garnier, Nike, Mastercard, Havells, Wrangler, Gulf Oil, Herbalife, Bata Power, and UNICEF India.Each campaign reportedly earns her between Rs 50 lakh and Rs 75 lakh, depending on its scale, contributing to her estimated net worth of Rs 32-34 crore.Palash Muchhal, meanwhile, has carved a successful path in music and filmmaking. Born in Indore in 1995 into a musical family, with sister Palak Muchhal already a known playback singer, Palash honed his talent early in Hindustani classical music and performed in charity concerts during his childhood.He has composed songs for films, television, and independent singles, with hits like “Party Toh Banti Hai” (Bhoothnath Returns), “Tu Hi Hai Aashiqui” (Dishkiyaoon), and “Musafir.” Beyond composing, he has directed over 40 music videos for major labels like T-Series and Zee Music, and has even acted in the film Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey. His net worth is estimated between Rs 20 crore and Rs 41 crore, coming from royalties, film projects, live shows, and music composition.Together, Smriti and Palash form one of cricket and entertainment’s wealthiest couples, with a combined net worth estimated between Rs 50 crore and Rs 75 crore. The duo has been dating since 2019 but maintained a low profile for years, only hinting at their relationship publicly in October 2025 when Palash teased that Smriti would soon become the “daughter-in-law of Indore.”","Palash muchhal proposed to smriti mandhana at mumbai’s dy patil stadium.

It’s no secret that the San Francisco 49ers released fullback Kyle Juszczyk this March to refocus their energy on a younger crop and to manage the salary cap, even though the team later re-signed him to a new, cheaper contract.Juszczyk recently opened up about the emotional moment during the “Kittle Things” podcast with San Francisco teammate and tight end George Kittle and his wife, Claire. Kyle and Kristin Juszczyk also opened up about their love story on the same podcast, and fans couldn’t help but gush about their fairy tale.Kyle Juszczyk’s wife, Kristin, is a popular sportswear designer and is now an officially licensed NFL partner, which gives her the right to use the league’s logos on her designs. Over the years, the two have shared countless viral moments, from their quirky pregame and postgame handshake to Kyle spotting Kristin in the crowd after scoring.But how did their story begin? The couple recently talked about their memorable first meeting during a joint appearance on George and Claire Kittle’s podcast.“I had just transferred to Towson University. We’re going to bring Uncle John into this. Everyone has an Uncle John, I feel like,” Kristin said.“My cousin was going to a nearby college. [Uncle John] got tickets to go see the [Baltimore] Ravens. I had never been to an NFL game before. My cousin didn’t want to go, so he texted me like, ‘Do you want to come to the game?’ And I was like, ‘Yeah, of course, why not? I’ve never been.’ They were playing the [Carolina] Panthers. You guys were whooping ass. So we got nosebleed seats, but they were whooping ass, so everyone left. It was like a 30-point difference.”Kristin also shared a rather uncanny moment where she spoke about marrying Kyle one day, on the day she saw him. Needless to say, she manifested her dreams into reality!“So Uncle John was like, ‘Let’s go behind the bench. Let’s go down there!’ So we go behind the bench and long story short, I saw Kyle on the field and thought he was very handsome. And I had a pamphlet because it was my first ever NFL game, so I was taking everything they were giving to me. I was looking through the pamphlet and I was like, ‘Oh my God, he’s only 23! He went to Harvard? OK, check.’ And then I went to Aunt Lisa — as a joke — like, ‘I’m going to marry that guy one day. ’ I swear to God.”Kyle and Kristin tied the knot in 2019, but quite a lot happened before they made their relationship official. Their love story unravelled on social media! In fact Kristin broke it down to the T.“A few weeks later, I told my friends about it and they were like, ‘Just request him on Facebook,’ because this was before Instagram was big. And then Kyle started liking my pictures from like five years ago.”Kyle admitted he was selective with his likes, only tapping on photos that featured Kristin alone. If the picture included friends or family, he scrolled right past it. He wanted her to know she had his full attention.Even so, the determined NFL star never went beyond quietly liking her posts.“He never messaged me! He was just being a creeper and liking my pictures,” Kristin shared. “A week goes by and I got a little liquid courage and I said, ‘Hey, what are the chances I’ll bump into you downtown?’ “Kyle recalled that his team the Ravens had a game that week, so he replied to Kristin saying the timing wasn’t ideal. Still, he told her he’d love to go out to dinner another time.They eventually met at a restaurant, and Kristin admitted she was “so nervous,” since she was only 20 then. But the jitters didn’t last long; the two connected right away, and the conversation flowed easily.“We literally closed down the restaurant,” Kyle said. “We were there for like three and a half hours. Neither of us were willing to get up and go pee, even though we both had to go so bad. So after three and a half hours, we were like, “OK, they’re closing the restaurant, we should probably go pee before we leave.’ ""","Kyle and kristin juszczyk talk about their love story.

Shubman Gill ruled out of South Africa ODIs; three captaincy candidates emerge

Poll Was Muthusamy's maiden Test century a turning point for South Africa in this match? Definitely, India are out of this game now Somewhat, but the match is still open Not really, India can still come back

Senuran Muthusamy picked the biggest stage available to him to deliver the defining innings of his career. The South African all-rounder raised his maiden Test century on Day 2 of the Guwahati Test, a calm, stubborn and eventually punishing knock that pushed India onto the back foot and gave the visitors control of the match.By lunch, South Africa had moved to 428 for 7 in 137 overs, with Muthusamy unbeaten on 107 off 203 balls. His innings included ten fours and two sixes, and came after an 88-run seventh-wicket stand with Kyle Verreynne, who was later stumped for 45 off 122. Marco Jansen joined him next and continued the same tempo, adding to a morning that steadily chipped away at India’s already stretched attack.The resistance deepened India’s frustration, which was evident in stand-in captain Rishabh Pant’s stump-mic remarks. At one point, he told his bowlers, ""Yaar 30 seconds ka timer hai,"" adding, ""Ghar pe khel rahe ho kya? Ek ball daal jaldi.""For Muthusamy, 31, the innings marked a major personal breakthrough. Born in Durban on 22 February 1994 to parents of Indian origin, he grew up with strong links to his Tamil heritage, with extended family still based in Nagapattinam, Tamil Nadu.His cricketing path began at Clifton School in Durban, where he also pursued academics.He also completed a degree in media and marketing, although cricket was to be his path.He then eventually made a name for himself with the Dolphins, and became a regular for the CSA 4-Day series first-class side in 2016/17, where he initially made his mark as a batter. He then put more focus on bowling and later completed the shift that turned him into a genuine all-rounder. That growth earned him a place in South Africa’s 2019 Test squad, where he dismissed Virat Kohli for his first scalp on debut in Visakhapatnam.In Guwahati, Muthusamy showed the full extent of that evolution. Patient early on and selective through the morning, he was in firm in control by the time he reached three figures. His knock, built on discipline rather than risk, ensured South Africa dictated terms through the session and kept India searching for answers as the Test moved deeper into Day 2.His ton also meant that he is the third South African batter to score a Test century from number 7 or lower against India. Quinton de Kock (111 in Visakhapatnam, 2019) and Lance Klusener (102* in Cape Town, 1997) were the other two to achieve this feat.Shortly after the final session of the day resumed, his magic run ended, with Mohammed Siraj dismissing him in his first ball after lunch, as Muthusamy holed one out to Jaiswal at fine-leg.","Senuran muthusamy scored his maiden test century on day 2 of the guwahati test.

The Georgia football program’s string of driving-related incidents continues



The Georgia football program is once again under the microscope after another driving-related arrest involving one of its players, extending a troubling pattern that has now surpassed 20 incidents in less than two years. Georgia offensive lineman Nyier Daniels was arrested Sunday morning and remains incarcerated at the time of this writing. The timing was striking, given that Daniels had just appeared in his third game of the season during Georgia’s 35 to 3 win over Charlotte on Saturday, logging 10 snaps for the Bulldogs. The redshirt freshman, once a highly regarded recruit, now finds his future in complete uncertainty.Online jail records indicate Daniels is facing three felony and 10 misdemeanor charges following his arrest by Commerce Police at 10 a.m. Sunday. Among the listed charges were two felony second degree cruelty to children charges and a felony fleeing or attempting to elude a police officer. The misdemeanor charges include stop and yield sign violations, reckless driving, and improper passing. The University of Georgia acknowledged the arrest publicly, stating, “We are aware of the charges and are currently in the process of gathering additional information.This is a pending legal matter and we will not have further comment at this time,” team spokesman Steven Drummond told the outlet.Daniels was ranked as a promising talent out of Bergen Catholic in New Jersey, and the expectations around him grew after early season participation that included 12 snaps in the opener against Marshall and nine more against Austin Peay. But DawgsHQ has reported that Daniels is no longer with the team, and the separation appears consistent with recent disciplinary moves from head coach Kirby Smart.Earlier this year, Smart indefinitely suspended receiver Nitro Tuggle and offensive lineman Marquis Easley after separate driving-related arrests. The gravity of these incidents carries heavy weight at Georgia, especially in light of the 2023 fatal crash that killed offensive lineman Devin Willock and recruiting staffer Chandler LeCroy after it was alleged LeCroy was racing defensive tackle Jalen Carter.The most recent arrest threatens to reignite national scrutiny at a critical moment. Georgia is preparing for a postseason run, and staying clear of off-field disruptions will be vital for continuity and focus. With the Bulldogs preparing to take on Georgia Tech in their ""Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate"" rivalry game at Mercedes-Benz Stadium, attention now shifts to how the program enforces accountability and ensures player conduct aligns with the standards expected in Athens.Also Read: Taylor Swift celebrates wild Chiefs overtime win after Travis Kelce’s wiped-out touchdown fuels dramatic Week 12 chaos","Georgia offensive lineman nyier daniels was arrested sunday morning and remains incarcerated at the time of this writing.

Vidit Gujrathi Exclusive: FIDE World Cup heartbreak, Goa controversy, bond with Anish Giri

NAGPUR: Fortune favours the brave and patience pays dividends. That was the twin morals of the story of Wei Yi earning his maiden Candidates berth, which the Chinese No. 1 secured on Sunday in Goa by reaching the Chess World Cup final. The tiebreak drama unfolded in the first set of 15-minute rapid games, within just under 2 hours of play, where the top two ranked grandmasters, youngest semifinalist Sindarov Javokhir and the oldest Wei Yi, registered contrasting victories to set up a title clash from Monday.While 19-year-old Sindarov defeated childhood friend Yakubboev Nodirbek in an all-Uzbekistan semifinal by snatching an early lead, the battle between Russia No. 2 Andrey Esipenko and world rapid No. 4 Wei was a contest of blunders, won by the “lucky” Chinese GM.In the all-Uzbek semifinal, Sindarov took the lead by winning the first game with black in 47 moves. In the double-rook endgame, Sindarov made his pawn do all the business as he utilised his clock well to carve out a classy win. When Yakubboev took over 4 minutes to make his 13th move, Sindarov had the time under his control.Despite not making any notable moves, Sindarov sealed the fate of his friend, who was left with no option but to resign with just 13 seconds left on the clock as against 2 minutes for his younger compatriot.In the following game, Sindarov played a fighting 54-move draw, making the most of his extra pawn to become the youngest GM in the Candidates tournament by reaching the final.The second board battle between the experienced Chinese and Russian GMs was a topsy-turvy contest in both games. While Wei had an opportunity to clinch the opening game with his black pieces, he missed the winning sequence and split the points with Esipenko on the 36th turn by repeating the moves.The following game saw all the drama where the Russian, on the verge of victory, hanged his rook to hand a heartbreak resignation while the Chinese star continued to make his moves as if saying to himself, “It’s never over until it’s over.”The 46-minute, 57-move game saw incredible final drama. First, Esipenko missed a win, and Wei played a couple of game-saving moves with just 1 second remaining on the clock. Still, things were under the control of Esipenko, who, with 2 extra pawns, was on the verge of qualifying for the World Cup final before he made the big rook-hanging blunder.On the 56th move, when Wei brought his knight back, Esipenko had a brain-fade moment as he forgot that his rook was under attack. Instead of placing his rook to safety, Esipenko made a blunder by advancing his passive (c6) pawn. Wei took just a second to capture Esipenko’s rook, and the Russian resigned while the Chinese qualified for both the World Cup final and the Candidates tournament.Wei said, “I was so lucky in this tournament. In the second game, Esipenko was winning, and I was fighting for a draw. Since this is a long tournament, he was tired, and he blundered. Earning the Candidates berth is one of the biggest goals of my career.”Despite the rook-hanging drama, Esipenko will get another chance to qualify for the Candidates in the knockout World Cup when he meets Yakubboev in the more anticipated third-place playoffs from Monday.",Chinese no. 1 wei yi qualifies for the chess world cup final in goa.
