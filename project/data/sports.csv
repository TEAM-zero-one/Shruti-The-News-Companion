Delhi’s worsening air quality cast a shadow over Lionel Messi ’s farewell appearance in India, as a section of the crowd at the Arun Jaitley Stadium voiced its anger at the political leadership even while welcoming the global football icon.As Chief Minister Rekha Gupta stepped onto the stage on Monday to receive Messi during the final leg of the GOAT India Tour, chants of “AQI, AQI” rang out from parts of the stands. The reaction came amid hazardous pollution levels in the national capital, with the Air Quality Index touching 498 in the morning before easing slightly to 427 by evening, remaining in the ‘severe’ category for the third consecutive day. Visibility across the city dropped sharply, with a thick haze obscuring the skyline.The chants contrasted sharply with the celebratory atmosphere inside the stadium, where nearly 25,000 fans had gathered to catch a glimpse of Messi. The Delhi leg marked the conclusion of a tour that had begun chaotically in Kolkata but ended on a more organised note in the capital. Spectators packed the stands, many wearing Argentina’s blue and white jersey with the iconic No. 10, while celebrities and dignitaries watched from inside the ground.Messi, speaking briefly in Spanish, thanked the crowd for the affection shown throughout his India visit. He described the experience as intense but unforgettable, saying the love he received exceeded expectations and promising that he would return to India someday, possibly to play a match.After arriving at the stadium, Messi walked around the field smiling, watched the 7x7 celebrity match conclude, and waved repeatedly to the crowd. Alongside Inter Miami teammates Luis Suarez and Rodrigo De Paul, he kicked footballs into the stands during a lap of honour and later felicitated the Minerva Academy football team. The reception was notably freer than in Kolkata, where heavy security and political entourages had limited fan interaction.The tightly scripted 30-minute programme revolved largely around Messi. He was joined on stage by Rekha Gupta, ICC chairman Jay Shah , DDCA president Rohan Jaitley and former India football captain Bhaichung Bhutia towards the end of the event.While Messi mania dominated the evening, the chants inside the stadium underlined a growing public frustration over Delhi’s air crisis, turning a celebratory sporting moment into a pointed reminder of the capital’s ongoing environmental emergency.",Delhi chief minister rekha gupta welcomed lionel messi to the arun jaitley stadium on monday.

Could Blake Lively make a surprise appearance with Travis Kelce in Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour documentary? Fan speculation heats up,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/could-blake-lively-make-a-surprise-appearance-with-travis-kelce-in-taylor-swifts-eras-tour-documentary-fan-speculation-heats-up/articleshow/125992717.cms,"Fans eagerly await potential unseen footage of Blake Lively in Taylor Swift's Eras Tour documentary. Their enduring, private friendship holds deep emotional weight for viewers, who see a possible cameo as a personal affirmation of loyalty and continuity amidst Swift's monumental tour. The documentary's blend of performance and personal storytelling fuels this anticipation.

Why Blake Lively’s possible cameo carries emotional weight for fans

For years, Taylor Swift and Blake Lively have represented one of pop culture’s most enduring celebrity friendships, blending music, film, family, and quiet loyalty away from the spotlight. As Swift’s Eras Tour documentary continues to roll out on Disney+, fans are once again analyzing every frame for personal moments that reveal life behind the stadium lights.With additional episodes set to arrive later this month, online speculation has intensified around whether Lively might appear in unseen footage. The curiosity isn’t just about a cameo, it reflects a deeper fascination with how Swift’s inner circle fits into one of the most ambitious tours in modern music history. For longtime fans, even a brief glimpse could feel meaningful.The Eras Tour documentary is not just a concert film, it functions as a time capsule of Swift’s creative process, personal resilience, and trusted relationships during a career-defining moment. While the project already features collaborators, dancers, and close friends, Lively’s absence so far has stood out to fans who have followed the duo’s friendship for over a decade.Their bond has often unfolded quietly, through shared milestones rather than constant public appearances. That low-profile dynamic has only fueled curiosity, especially since Lively has remained largely out of the public eye in recent months amid a widely discussed legal dispute connected to a past film project.As a result, some fans see a potential documentary appearance as symbolic, not promotional, but personal.What also adds intrigue is timing. The remaining episodes are expected to spotlight more candid moments from Swift’s tour life, including downtime, private celebrations, and emotional checkpoints behind the scenes. If Lively does appear, it would likely be organic rather than staged, reinforcing the authenticity Swift has emphasized throughout the project.Beyond speculation, the conversation highlights something larger: the Eras Tour documentary has blurred the line between performance and personal storytelling. Fans aren’t only watching for vocals and choreography, they’re searching for quiet confirmations of loyalty, healing, and continuity amid massive success.Whether Lively ultimately appears or not, the attention underscores how invested audiences remain in Swift’s personal narrative. A brief moment, a background shot, or even an off-camera mention would be enough to spark discussion. For now, viewers are watching closely, convinced that if the friendship does surface, it will do so naturally, just like it always has.Also Read: Taylor Swift’s Eras Tour has a hidden Joe Alwyn connection amid her engagement to Travis Kelce","Fans eagerly await potential unseen footage of blake lively in taylor swift's eras tour documentary.

Dwyane Wade reflects on LeBron James in Year 23





Dwyane Wade and LeBron James memories from the Heat era





The bond between Dwyane Wade and LeBron James has always been special. As James steps into Year 23, Wade no longer speaks as a former teammate alone. He speaks as a fan who understands what the league is slowly preparing to lose. Recently, Wade commented on James’ 23rd NBA season comes contemplating who shared championships, pressure, and history with James at the highest level.Wade’s words arrive at a time when every appearance by LeBron feels meaningful. The milestones keep coming, yet the uncertainty lingers. For Wade, that reality has shifted how he watches the game now. There is admiration, reflection, and a sense of time closing in on an era few believed possible.Speaking candidly, Dwyane Wade did not hide the emotion tied to watching James still perform at an elite level. His appreciation felt personal and honest.“I’m like you guys, I’m a fan. I know it’s like, ‘he’s old, he should retire’. But at the same time, I’m gonna miss him… He’s just taking these moments in, we don’t know when the last one is coming.”Wade’s praise for James is not a one time thing. Previously, in episode of Wy Network by Dwyane Wade, the Heat legend shared his candid thoughts.“I have the greatest body of work of anybody that’s ever put a Miami Heat jersey on,” Wade said.“If you wanna be honest, LeBron James is the greatest player to ever put a Miami Heat jersey on… I’m the greatest player in the history of the Miami Heat for the body of work I had wearing that jersey, but I’m not the greatest player to ever put on a Miami Heat jersey.”Dwyane Wade retired from the NBA in 2019 after 16 seasons, mostly with the Miami Heat. He admitted his burst was fading and the joy was gone, even as a Hall of Famer. Since retiring, Wade thrives as a businessman, media voice, and NBA owner, while proudly supporting his daughter Zaya.Wade recently revisited another iconic chapter with humor while recalling the famous Big Three introduction. His memory of that moment revealed both restraint and foresight.“Let’s run that tape who was it again. It’s one voice and look at the one in the middle laughing like young boy over here was talking… he was feeling the moment… look I look put my head down, look I put my head down, ‘I’m like hey man look now I’mma supportive teammate.'”“I’m my rubbing my knee I’m like ‘Oh I don’t know if I got that much… He trippin’, look I ain’t said a word… That was that supposed to have been a moment that was just for our fans and it should not have been the world should not have seen.”“That’s something that you say internal, you know what I mean? We going to win every year but really you know how hard it is to win one year. I don’t care what kind of talent you have so that’s why I was sitting there like oh my man don’t know yet.”“But he did go to the Finals 10 years in a row though. He damn sure didn’t like about how many opportunities. He almost did it, he ain’t lie… Listen, we went 4, he went 10.”In September this year, the 2025 Basketball Hall of Fame weekend carried special meaning for LeBron James and Dwyane Wade. While Wade was inducted in 2023 and James awaits retirement, both attended to honor the 2008 Team USA “Redeem Team.” The group’s induction marked a defining chapter in USA Basketball history. James and Wade shared a light moment before the ceremony, reflecting their long bond. The duo helped lead Team USA to Olympic gold in Beijing after the 2004 setback. That victory sparked a dominant run, with five straight Olympic gold medals since 2008.LeBron James is not stopping despite recent injury setbacks. The King got back on his feet and made a strong comeback. So far, he has not shared any update on his retirement.Also Read: ""The Kings are here"": LeBron James & Jay-Z's courtside moment sends NBA fans into meltdown","Dwyane wade retired from the nba in 2019 after 16 seasons, mostly with the miami heat.

IPL mini auction: Lot of interest for Cam Green | Wait ends for Prithvi Shaw, Sarfaraz Khan?

Mallika Sagar will be a familiar and significant presence when the IPL 2026 auction unfolds on Tuesday, December 16. For many fans, her presence in the room has become part of the modern IPL auction experience. Yet behind that composed exterior lies a journey that is both unusual and groundbreaking.Born in Mumbai in 1975, Sagar has built a rare career that bridges two traditionally exclusive worlds — fine art and elite sports auctions. Raised in a business-minded household, her fascination with auctioneering began unexpectedly, sparked by a book that featured a woman auctioneer as its protagonist. That early inspiration eventually set her on a path few in India had walked before.Sagar’s academic journey took her from Mumbai to Connecticut, before she graduated with a degree in Art History from Bryn Mawr College in Philadelphia. In 2001, she began her professional career at Sotheby’s London, developing deep expertise in Indian and South Asian art. Her rise was swift and historic. At the age of 26, she became Christie’s first Indian woman auctioneer in New York, specialising in modern and contemporary Indian art — a landmark achievement that established her credibility on the global auction circuit.After gaining years of international experience, Sagar returned to Mumbai and worked closely with renowned institutions such as Pundole’s Art Gallery. Her success in the art world laid the groundwork for a seamless transition into sports auctions, where her clarity, precision and authority quickly stood out.The turning point came in 2021 when she was appointed the first female auctioneer in the Pro Kabaddi League , breaking another long-standing barrier in a male-dominated space. Two years later, she was entrusted with conducting the inaugural Women’s Premier League auction, further cementing her growing influence in Indian sport.She subsequently conducted the IPL 2024 mini-auction and the high-profile IPL 2025 mega auction held in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.In 2025, Sagar added yet another milestone by leading the WPL 2026 auction, reinforcing her status as one of the most trusted and accomplished auctioneers in the sport.","Mallika sagar will be a familiar and significant presence when the ipl 2026 auction unfolds on tuesday, december 16.

IPL mini auction: Lot of interest for Cam Green | Wait ends for Prithvi Shaw, Sarfaraz Khan?

As the IPL 2026 mini auction gets underway on Tuesday, 16 December, attention is not just on the bidding battles but on a key rule that has quietly reshaped how overseas players are paid. While franchises may still drive prices higher inside the auction room, foreign cricketers will not take home the full amount once bidding crosses a fixed threshold.Under regulations enforced by the IPL governing council, overseas players can earn a maximum of INR 18 crore from the mini auction, regardless of how high franchises push the bidding. Even if a player attracts offers beyond that figure, his final salary will remain capped.The rule comes into focus as teams get ready to spend heavily. Kolkata Knight Riders enter the auction with the largest purse of INR 64.3 crore, while Chennai Super Kings have INR 43.6 crore. Despite the financial muscle on display, the new cap ensures that international stars will not receive inflated pay packets.The ceiling was introduced by the BCCI ahead of the IPL 2025 mega auction and has now been applied to mini auctions as well. It matches the highest retention slab from the previous mega auction, effectively keeping overseas salaries at a consistent maximum level.The move is aimed at enforcing financial discipline and preventing runaway inflation, a recurring trend in mini auctions driven by supply and demand gaps.In recent seasons, mini auctions have produced eye catching figures for overseas fast bowlers and all-rounders, often despite limited availability because of international schedules. Such deals triggered concerns around fairness, long term budgeting and the sustainability of franchise spending.Under the current framework, if an overseas player is bid up to INR 20 crore, he will still receive only INR 18 crore. The remaining INR 2 crore is transferred to the BCCI’s player welfare fund. Crucially, the franchise must still pay the full bid amount from its purse.The restriction applies only to overseas players. Indian cricketers remain exempt and will receive the full value of their winning bids, even if the amount exceeds INR 18 crore.","Ipl 2026 mini auction gets underway on tuesday, 16 december.

How do Connor McDavid and Kris Knoblauch view Edmonton Oilers’ Goaltending trade?

Edmonton Oilers Trade Skinner + Kulak For Jarry + Poulin Thoughts | Quinn Hughes To Wild

On Saturday, the Edmonton Oilers' locker room was filled with a combination of feelings and expectations as the team prepared for a huge roster change before their game against the Toronto Maple Leafs. The exchange that sent goalie Stuart Skinner and defenseman Brett Kulak to the Pittsburgh Penguins was a drastic change for a team that had trusted both players during their long playoff runs. The names of Connor McDavid , Kris Knoblauch, Tristan Jarry, and Spencer Stastney were soon among the top talks of Edmonton, looking ahead to the future. The trade marked an emotional shift ahead of Edmonton's next chapter.The move was meant to tackle the goalkeeping issues, but the human aspect of the decision could not be overlooked. Skinner had been with the Oilers for parts of six seasons and had helped the team reach the Stanley Cup Finals twice in a row. Kulak was also a dependable player on the defense. After the morning skate, McDavid talked about how hard the moment was, and he made it clear that the loss of the familiar faces weighed on the team, even as they were getting ready for a new chapter.Connor McDavid called the trade a tough decision that the team had to make, and at the same time pointed to the positive side of the situation by saying how much the group would miss Skinner and Kulak.Head Coach Kris Knoblauch was equally supportive, stating that both players had been very dependable over the years, contributing not only on but also off the ice. Another ex-Oilers defenseman, Troy Stecher, who now plays for Toronto, offered his insight into the situation, too. He referred to the trade as part of the business and wished his ex-colleagues nothing but the best in their new home, Pittsburgh.The focus was then directed towards the newly recruited players. Knoblauch showed trust in Tristan Jarry and mentioned his experience and the good results he had in the past, despite a hard previous season. Jarry, who got the call against Toronto, shared that the last day and a half had been full of emotions but added that getting to play with superstars like McDavid and Leon Draisaitl was a thrill. At the same time, the rapid development of Spencer Stastney, who has been skating and moving the puck well, caught the coaching staff's attention, which believed that such a skill would bring the team more balance.The Oilers are taking change with a careful and optimistic attitude. The loss of reliable teammates is painful, but Edmonton is convinced that this kind of change will help the team to be better and thus to navigate through the season.Also Read: NHL Injury Update: Evgeni Malkin sidelined as Pittsburgh Penguins face playoff pressure","Edmonton oilers traded goalie stuart skinner and defenseman brett kulak to the pittsburgh penguins.

Hockey’s first openly gay pro Brock McGillis explains why HBO’s Heated Rivalry hype could actually make NHL players less likely to come out,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/hockeys-first-openly-gay-pro-brock-mcgillis-explains-why-hbos-heated-rivalry-hype-could-actually-make-nhl-players-less-likely-to-come-out/articleshow/125993047.cms,"Heated Rivalry won’t create safer coming-out moments in the NHL, says Brock McGillis (Getty Images and HBO max)

Brock McGillis challenges Heated Rivalry impact on hockey coming out narrative



The debate around visibility in professional hockey has resurfaced, but this time it is driven by fiction colliding with lived reality. As LGBTQ+ stories gain space on major platforms, questions linger about whether representation alone can shift a deeply rooted sports culture. For some, progress feels close. For others, the gap between screen and locker room remains wide.Brock McGillis knows that gap better than most. As the first openly gay professional hockey player, he has spent years navigating conversations that often miss the harder truths. While HBO’s Heated Rivalry has drawn praise and attention, McGillis is clear that popularity does not always equal impact, especially inside a sport he says still struggles with normalized homophobia.McGillis pushed back strongly against claims that the series could encourage NHL players to come out. Speaking to PinkNews, he said he “wholeheartedly” disagrees with former NHL player Sean Avery’s belief that the show opens doors. “It’s probably more likely to have an adverse effect on a player coming out,” McGillis, 42, told the website. “And I hate to be negative because I really enjoy the show. But I also don’t believe that many hockey bros are going to watch it.And I don’t think, if they are watching it, they’re talking about it positively.”The series follows two fictional star players locked in a secret relationship for years. While the storyline has resonated with many viewers, McGillis argues that it risks oversimplifying what real players face. He points to his own experience after coming out in 2016, long after his semi-professional career ended. Despite extensive media coverage, he says the ripple effect never came. “Nobody’s like, ‘Oh, yeah. This came out and now I’m ready [to come out],’ ” McGillis told PinkNews. “It’s not happening.”For McGillis, the core issue is not a lack of stories but the culture surrounding the sport. He describes homophobia as something that “starts at a very young age and progresses,” reinforced daily through language and behavior. Watching Heated Rivalry even stirred personal memories. “Episode one gave me a panic attack,” he said, recalling years spent hiding a relationship. “I dated a guy for three years, not a soul in my life knowing. We had an alias for [me in his phone] in case [his friends] ever saw.”Still, McGillis does not dismiss the show entirely. He believes it could help people around players understand them better. “It might help the people around [players] understand a little more if they’re dating somebody; hopefully,” he said. And despite his criticism, he maintains faith in teammates themselves. “If a player did come out, hockey players would be the most likely to rally around their teammate more than any of the other big sports. ”For now, McGillis remains focused on advocacy, urging the sport to confront its realities head-on rather than leaning on fiction to do the work.Also Read: Sidney Crosby sounds alarm after Penguins blow multi-goal lead again, this time against Utah Mammoth","Brock mcgillis, the first openly gay professional hockey player, says hbo's heated rivalry won't create safer coming-out moments in the nhl.
