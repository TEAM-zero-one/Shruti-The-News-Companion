He has played two ODIs and 35 T20Is for Pakistan. The Shaheens tour was seen as a chance for him to return to form and fit into Pakistan's aggressive T20 playing style.Ali was touring with Pakistan's Shaheens squad, their 'A' team, in England when the arrest happened in Beckenham. He played all five games of the tour, including matches before and after the alleged incident. He was set to join the team in Australia for a T20 series but has been replaced by Mohammad Faiq.The police have said: ""After receiving a report on Monday 4 August 2025 of a rape, we have arrested a 24-year-old man.

Fortnite has recently announced its highly awaited collaboration with the Power Rangers. In this crossover, we will see The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers take action against the Kraken-borne bugs in Chapter 6 Season 4 in Fortnite.From the Mighty Morphin Megazord to themed weapons like the Swarmstrike Launcher and the OG “Go Go Power Rangers” theme song, this collaboration will have everything it it. However, the highlight of this collab has to be the Power Rangers costume, which fans can get early even before its actual release.Just like players were able to notch up the Fantastic Four skins early before their release by participating in the Fantastic Four Cup in Fortnite, now there is another couple of tournaments which can grant two Power Ranger skins early - Red Ranger Cup and Pink Ranger Cup.Both the cups are going to take place on August 6, 2025. These are going to be solo tournaments, where players will take part in standard Battle Royale matches. Players need to check out the in-game Compete tab to know the exact timings of these tournaments as they will vary depending upon different locations and timezones.The Red and Pink Rangers Cup will be available for only three hours. In this short span, players can enter a maximum of 10 matches per cup.If you are thinking about maximizing your chances by taking part in both the cups, then keep in mind that they will become live simultaneously and will expire at the same time. So, it is advised to the fans to only focus on one cup at a time.As the name suggests, these two cups will grant the Red Ranger and Pink Ranger outfits respectively. But how to get them? In order to obtain these skins for absolutely free, players need to be on the top spots for different regions in these tournaments. Players can score points to be in the leaderboards by winning matches and eliminating opponent players. Here is the region wise breakdown and top spots to secure the skins:Another interesting fact about these cups are that, these aren't region locked. So, if you are facing difficulties to be in the leaderboard in your native regions, then you will always have the option to change your server to any location for a favorable condition.However, those who fail to be in the top spots in these two cups, don’t need to be disappointed at all. If any player manages to score 8 points in either of the tournaments, then he will be rewarded with the Jason’s Mark Spray (Red Ranger Cup) or the Kimberly Was Here Spray (Pink Ranger Cup) or both.Usually players get their rewards from such tournaments immediately after these end. But the Red Ranger and Pink Ranger outfits will be available to the tournament winners at the start of Chapter 6 Season 4.Apart from the two tournaments, the Season 4 Battle Pass has also featured two different power ranger skins as well - the Green Ranger and the White Ranger.","Red and pink power ranger cups will grant players power ranger skins.

WWE's Friday Night SmackDown's August 8th edition was another episode set around the fallout from SummerSlam 2025. Live from the Bell Centre in Montreal, Quebec, this SmackDown edition is only a week after the big 2-night event in New Jersey - SummerSlam 2025. Fans expected an appearance from John Cena , and he didn't disappoint. He opened the show to loud cheers from the audience, who loved having the real and face Cena back among them.John Cena obviously was going to address what happened at the end of that night at SummerSlam, and the return of none other than Brock Lesnar back to the ring after more than a year of absence. Cena talks about the crowd and how loud and warm it was. He said he feared leaving it all behind after 2 decades in this business, and that people would forget about him once he leaves. He also fears Lesnar, but he is not going to let that hold him down.The Cenation leader says that if Brock Lesnar wanted some, he could come and get some. Just then, Logan Paul makes his entrance to loud boos from the audience as usual. He mocks Cena for turning face again, and says since Cena was giving out matches, he wants one. He proposes a face-off at Clash in Paris when Drew McIntyre attacks Cena from behind.Things were getting a little tough for Cena with these two after him, but just then, none other than Cody Rhodes makes his appearance, and the crowd goes wild.He and Cena make quick work of Paul and McIntyre, and Cena accepts Paul's challenge for Clash in Paris, but before that Rhodes and he will fight Paul and McIntyre in a tag team match tonight. The fans are eating.The first fight of the night is a tag team match between The Motor City Machine Guns vs. Talla Tonga and JC Mateo of Solo Sikoa's faction, MFT. The latter makes quick work of the MCMG and comes out on top after a chokeslam from Talla Tonga on Chris Sabin.Of course, after the match, Solo Sikoa comes to the stage. After hyping the MFT, he says that it's a shame that he is all geared up and ready to fight, but there is no one to fight him. Just then, WWE ’s SmackDown GM Nick Aldis makes an appearance and says since Sikoa is so ready to fight, he has someone he can fight. None other than Sami Zayn comes in, and we have our next match ready to go.The match starts after Sami Zayn is done basking in the cheers of the Montreal crowd. Solo Sikoa tries to back Zayn into a corner, but the latter is not having that. When it seems like Zayn is getting the upper hand, Tala Tonga runs interference, Zayn beckons him when Sikoa comes from behind. But Zayn anticipated that and goes for a folding press, taking the win.Backstage Charlotte Flair tells her tag team partner, Alexa Bliss , that since it's the latter's birthday tomorrow, she got her a gift. But she will give it to her on the stage with grandeur. The Allies of Convenience then make their entrance to loud cheering from the Montreal crowd. Flair shows Bliss her gifts - a cake (for both of them) and a tag team partner for Lilly - Charlie, both wearing a WE'RE NOT FRIENDS T-shirt like Little Miss Bliss.And just when everyone thought we were getting a hug from the two non-friends, Chelsea Green and her Secret Hervice make their entrance. Green begins to talk smack to the Tag Team Champions, and Flair says since it's Bliss' birthday, she is ready to give her another present - a show to a fight with Chelsea Green. The Secret Hervice and their leader tried to dodge and flee, but Nick Aldis comes in once more and gives Bliss his own little gift - a brand new referee whose first match is going to be overseeing the one between Flair and Green. And we have our next fight ready to go.Both women inside the ring - Charlotte Flair and Chelsea Green - are powerful and talented. And they bring it to the ring. Flair goes for her opponent with everything she's got, but Green is not one to be quiet about it. Flair goes for a German suplex, Green counters with a superplex. Green gains momentum for a while, and asks Piper Niven and Alba Fyre to bring in the cake that Flair had gotten for Alexa Bliss' birthday.Unfortunately, for Chelsea Green, the plan backfired. While Bliss takes out the Secret Hervice, Flair goes for a killswitch into the cake. And finally, a Figure Eight proves too much for Green who has no other choice but to accept defeat.The segment ends with Flair and Bliss eating the very cake that Flair used to smash Chelsea Green's face into.We also get a little backstage segment of John Cena and R-Truth getting to catch-up backstage. Truth says if Cena is back, then he is back, and it adds to a fun moment before the tag team stage is set for the night.The last match of the night is between Cody Rhodes & John Cena vs. Drew McIntyre & Logan Paul. Rhodes and Paul start it off with McIntyre and Cena on the sidelines. The American Nightmare bashes into his opponent, and soon after, he gives the tag to the Scottish Psychopath. Then it's one after the other as McIntyre and Paul go in and out of the ring, but Rhodes is stuck without being able to tag in his partner.The crowd is chanting ""We want Cena,"" but it is while before Rhodes can finally tag John Cena in. Shoulder block after shoulder block, Cena goes to pin The Maverick after an Attitude Adjustment, but McIntyre interrupts before the three count. Rhodes comes in to block a Claymore from McIntyre and the referee calls it.Cena and Paul continue fighting backstage, while Rhodes and McIntyre are still in it. The latter blasts Rhodes with his own championship belt and then pushes him through the table after a Claymore. The night ends with McIntyre talking smack into Cody's ears as he lies there unable to move.Also Read: “I’m happy to have him back”: Paul Heyman defends Brock Lesnar’s return to WWE","Wwe's friday night smackdown's august 8th edition was another episode set around the fallout from summerslam 2025.

Martina Navratilova on Chris Evert’s upbringing and public image

The comment added a new angle to the long rivalry between the two stars and surprised many fans who remembered Evert as the perfect all-American player.In her 1985 book “Being Myself,” Martina wrote about how fans and the press treated female players. She wrote that American crowds liked quiet, neat players and often did not like women who spoke up or showed anger.Martina Navratilova said a player like Chris Evert was accepted because she did not “make waves,” while outspoken women were often criticized.

She grew up in a devout Catholic home, went to St. Thomas Aquinas High School, and learned tennis from her father, who coached her.she said.Martina Navratilova suggested that Evert’s family rules made her cautious in public because she wanted to make her parents proud.

She said that under communism women were encouraged to work and be athletes, so she did not face the same home limits that Evert had.Martina Navratilova also admitted she sometimes wanted the same warm praise Evert received from fans.

The future of Connor McDavid in the National Hockey League (NHL) has never looked more uncertain or more thrilling. As the face of the Edmonton Oilers, McDavid has been expected to re-sign and carry the team into another championship run. But now, insiders say a single factor could tip the scales in favor of a bombshell move to the Toronto Maple Leafs, led by none other than fellow superstar Auston Matthews.Despite ongoing discussions with the Oilers, McDavid has yet to finalize an extension deal, sparking whispers across the NHL. The delay follows Edmonton’s recent Stanley Cup Finals defeat to the Florida Panthers, which may have raised questions about the team’s long-term competitiveness and direction. While McDavid remains under contract, the league is already buzzing with the possibility of him testing free agency in 2026.At the heart of McDavid’s decision lies more than just money. Sources suggest lifestyle, team trajectory, and his legacy in the game may all be weighing heavily on his mind. The Edmonton Oilers are prepared to throw down a historic offer that could surpass anything the NHL has seen, but whether that’s enough remains to be seen.If McDavid decides to stay, the Oilers will maintain one of the most dangerous cores in hockey. But if he opts to join Matthews in Toronto, the NHL landscape will shift dramatically, potentially setting up a new era of Eastern Conference dominance.For now, the hockey world waits.

Phoenix Suns’ Perspective

Los Angeles Lakers’ Offseason Strategy

Why This Move Makes Sense Now

Thehave already made notable moves this offseason, but reports suggest they could still pursue further roster upgrades to bolster their chances in the competitive Western Conference. According to Dean Simon of Sporting News, adding another reliable two-way wing might be the next step, and Phoenix Suns forward Royce O’Neale could be the ideal target.For the Los Angeles Lakers to land O’Neale, the most realistic package would likely involve rookie forward Dalton Knecht and an expiring contract, such as Maxi Kleber’s $11 million deal. While Knecht was initially seen as a promising fit when the Lakers drafted him 17th overall in 2024, the relationship between him and the front office may have soured after an attempted trade during the past season.Royce O’Neale, 32, offers proven playoff experience, defensive versatility, and consistent three-point shooting - a combination that could perfectly complement both LeBron James and Luka Dončić . In the 2024-25 season with the Suns, he delivered career-best numbers in several categories.His ability to hit shots at a high volume from deep while guarding multiple positions makes him a valuable asset for any team aiming for a deep playoff run.The Phoenix Suns could view Knecht as a young scoring forward who fits their ongoing youth movement following the trade of Kevin Durant to the Houston Rockets earlier this summer. Knecht’s upside and offensive potential might appeal to a franchise looking to develop younger talent for the future.This offseason, the Los Angeles Lakers have already added Marcus Smart, the 2022 Defensive Player of the Year, and 2018 No. 1 overall pick Deandre Ayton on team-friendly contracts. While these moves strengthen both ends of the court, Dean Simon notes that “more work is left to be done if the Lakers want to compete with the Western Conference’s top-tier talent.”• Playoff-ready addition: Royce O’Neale brings eight years of NBA experience, including significant postseason minutes.• Perfect floor spacer: His 40.6% accuracy from three on nearly six attempts per game could open up the floor for James and Dončić.• Defensive boost: Capable of guarding wings and smaller forwards effectively.• Low-risk trade: Lakers part with an unproven rookie and an expiring contract for a veteran who fits their immediate championship window.Also read: Why the Los Angeles Lakers Could Move $51 Million Star Following Legendary Luka Doncic Contract Extension, Per NBA Analyst If Rob Pelinka opts to make the deal, the Los Angeles Lakers could significantly enhance their depth and versatility - two qualities that could prove decisive in a loaded Western Conference.","The los angeles lakers have already added marcus smart and deandre ayton.

Shedeur Sanders shines in NFL preseason debut with Browns, scores first touchdown



Shedeur Sanders: A debut with promise and room to grow



Shedeur Sanders wasted no time making his mark in the NFL . In his preseason debut on Friday night against the Carolina Panthers, the Cleveland Browns rookie quarterback delivered both poise and playmaking flair. Within the first quarter, Sanders not only moved the chains with his legs but also threw the first official touchdown pass of his professional career- a moment that sparked excitement among fans and drew an emotional reaction from his father, Deion Sanders.Shedeur Sanders’s big moment came late in the first quarter. After Browns linebacker Nathaniel Watson recovered a fumble deep in Panthers territory, Cleveland found themselves just 10 yards from the end zone. Two plays later, Sanders zipped a perfectly placed seven-yard strike to Kaden Davis, threading the football between two defenders for six points. The rookie had already flashed his versatility earlier, scrambling 10 yards on a third-and-9 to secure his first NFL first down.Interestingly, Sanders wasn’t even expected to start this game. Entering camp, he was listed last on the team’s initial depth chart, competing against Kenny Pickett, Joe Flacco, and Dillon Gabriel.But with Pickett and Gabriel sidelined by injuries, Sanders got the nod—and he seized the moment. His first touchdown came on his fourth drive, capitalizing after a muffed punt set up another red-zone chance.For Deion Sanders, this was a proud parent moment. Watching from afar rather than the sidelines, the Pro Football Hall of Famer celebrated online, posting, “Yes Lawd! Yes!” before the night was over. Before kickoff, Deion had expressed confidence in his son’s readiness, saying, “He’s gonna be a problem out there tonight.”The debut wasn’t flawless—Sanders missed an open target and felt the full brunt of NFL pass rush pressure for the first time—but it was undeniably encouraging. He showcased mobility, arm talent, and composure under the lights, converting key third downs both by running and throwing.With the Browns’ quarterback competition still wide open, Sanders’ performance on Friday has given coaches more to consider. If he continues to build on this momentum, the rookie could climb the depth chart faster than expected—and perhaps turn what began as a temporary opportunity into something far more permanent.Also Read: Tom Brady heaps praise on Patrick Mahomes’ career so far: ""Love watching him play”","Cleveland browns rookie quarterback shedeur sanders made his nfl debut on friday night.

The Sports Gossip Show hosts say Hudson announced herself as “the president of your universe” and that she liked being compared to Tree Paine, Taylor Swift ’s long-time publicist. The hosts thought Hudson might come on the show, but the talks fell apart after angry calls and long, confusing conversations.Charlotte Wilder and Madeline Hill said the first call came after their episode about the Miss Maine pageant. Wilder said Hudson told her she liked being called Bill Belichick’s PR person and agreed when the hosts compared her to Tree Paine.Tree Paine has been Taylor Swift’s publicist since 2014 and helped guide Swift through big scandals and media moments. The hosts said Hudson sounded confident at times and confused at others, and that she often spoke in circles.Wilder and Hill said the conversations stretched over several hours and days. They said Hudson used legal terms and sometimes “word salad,” which made clear answers hard to find.Also Read: Mike McDaniel forced to break up Miami Dolphins sideline fight during heated preseason practice with Chicago Bears When the hosts told Hudson the podcast had joined The Athletic earlier that week, Hudson grew upset and told them The Athletic had beenandaccording to Wilder.The final call ended with Hudson yelling and crying.

How realistic is it for Connor McDavid to catch Wayne Gretzky’s untouchable points record?

The more attainable milestone: Oilers’ all-time points leader

Wayne Gretzky’s career point total — 2,857 — has long been considered hockey’s most unbreakable record. Across 1,487 NHL regular-season games, “The Great One” scored 894 goals and recorded 1,963 assists, dominating an era when goal-scoring exploded. The 1980s saw Gretzky surpass the 200-point mark four times, with league scoring averages often exceeding 7.5 goals per game. In today’s NHL, where the average sits closer to 6.0, matching that level of production presents a far steeper challenge.Connor McDavid has been rewriting the modern offensive playbook. Through 712 games, the Edmonton Oilers captain has tallied 361 goals and 721 assists for 1,082 points — an astounding pace in the current low-scoring climate. At just 28 years old, McDavid has already topped 120 points in three of the last four seasons, showing no signs of slowing down.While McDavid’s production is elite, the numbers reveal the monumental scale of the task. Over his career, McDavid averages about 125 points per season. Gretzky’s pace? Around 158 per year — even after factoring in his final seasons during the so-called “dead puck era.”To pass Gretzky’s 2,857 points, McDavid would need another 1,775 points.At his current pace, that’s more than 14 additional seasons, or roughly 1,165 games, with no significant decline. This would require him to remain productive into his early 40s, in an Ovechkin-like career marathon. Realistically, the physical demands and inevitable drop in production make this almost impossible.While Gretzky’s all-time NHL mark may remain out of reach, McDavid is well within striking distance of another historic achievement — becoming Edmonton’s all-time franchise points leader. Gretzky’s Oilers record stands at 1,669 points, meaning McDavid needs just 587 more. At his current pace, he could surpass that within five seasons.Of course, one key factor remains — his contract. McDavid’s current deal expires on July 1, 2026, and securing an extension will be crucial if he hopes to cement that title in an Oilers uniform.Also Read: “Pretty dumb”: Fans revolt as NHL turns its ‘heritage’ Stadium Series into a Florida marketing stunt Breaking Gretzky’s NHL record might be a dream too far, but McDavid’s legacy as one of the game’s greatest scorers is already secure — and his chase for franchise history is very much alive.","Wayne gretzky’s career point total of 2,857 has long been considered hockey's most unbreakable record.

Poll Do you think Gautam Gambhir's reaction to the pitch curator was justified? Yes, he was right to defend his team No, he should have handled it better

NEW DELHI: Former Australian batter Matthew Hayden has offered his verdict on India head coach Gautam Gambhir ’s fiery altercation with Oval pitch curator Lee Fortis ahead of the series-deciding fifth Test against England during Anderson-Tendulkar Trophy.The flashpoint occurred during India’s training session, when Gambhir was heard telling Fortis, “You don’t tell any of us what we need to do. You have no right to tell us, you’re just a groundsman, nothing more,” while pointing a finger at the chief curator. Batting coach Sitanshu Kotak quickly stepped in, pulling Fortis aside to cool tempers.Speaking on All Over Bar The Cricket after India’s 2-2 series draw, Hayden said the incident reflected a common dynamic in England.“This is a typical case in England. It is a bit of a flex — here we are, final Test match, this is my venue, and they are going to try and make it difficult on Gautam Gambhir. But I think he's got every right to tone it down. He could have used better language. But the reality is, his team is trying to train ahead of the most important Test match,” Hayden remarked.Former Australian all-rounder Greg Blewett backed Hayden’s assessment, recalling his own frustrations with pitch restrictions.“I agree. Even now, even as a commentator, you get near the pitch and everyone is saying you can't get anywhere near it and you're like I haven't got spikes on. It is quite ridiculous. I get the frustration. But I agree that the language that he used wasn't great. If he reflects, he could have probably handled it a little better,” Blewett said.Despite the controversy, India shifted focus back to cricket, pulling off a thrilling 6-run victory at the Oval to level the series — leaving the verbal clash as just another subplot in an epic series in England.","Former australian batter matthew hayden has offered his verdict on india head coach gautam gambhir ’s fiery altercation with oval pitch curator lee fortis.
