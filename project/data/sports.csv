While he didn’t name names, the context was unmistakable, especially given recent headlines surrounding Bündchen's ongoing relationship with her jiu-jitsu trainer, who is now widely rumored to be her partner and the father figure in her children’s lives.“Willful blindness” is not just a phrase—it’s a powerful acknowledgment of emotional compromise. Tom Brady’s reflection reveals the cost of chasing perfection on the field while personal issues simmer in the background. The quarterback, once seemingly invincible both in his career and family life, now speaks like someone reckoning with the pain of being left behind. For fans, it’s a rare and raw admission: the GOAT is still just a man.The emotional fallout of watching Bündchen move on publicly is undoubtedly difficult for someone so accustomed to control and success.

Bam Adebayo: The Ideal Frontcourt Upgrade

How Adebayo Fits with the Golden State Warriors

Thenarrowly escaped a Play-In disaster against the Memphis Grizzlies , securing the No. 7 seed in the Western Conference. But even with their postseason spot locked in, changes may be necessary this offseason—starting with moving on from Buddy Hield and pursuing Miami Heat star, as predicted by Caleb Hightower of Sporting News Buddy Hield’s early-season promise as a Klay Thompson replacement has faded. His three-point shooting, once reliable, has plummeted to concerning lows:- December: 30.5% from three- January: 31.5% from three- Play-In performance: 1-of-4 from deep against MemphisWhile Hield finished the regular season at 37.0% from beyond the arc, his inconsistency makes him a liability. As Caleb Hightower noted,If the Golden State Warriors exit the playoffs early, targeting Bam Adebayo in a trade could reshape their roster. The three-time All-Star has evolved into a complete two-way force:- 2024-25 Stats: 18.1 PPG, 9.6 RPG, 4.3 APG- Shooting Splits: 48.5% FG, 35.7% 3P- Versatility: Scores inside, handles the ball, and stretches the floorAdebayo’s growth from a defensive specialist to an offensive weapon addresses Golden State’s need for a dynamic big man.1. Scoring Boost: Provides interior scoring and mid-range efficiency.2. Playmaking: Adds a facilitator from the high post.3. Defensive Anchor: Complements Draymond Green’s versatility.The Trade ScenarioA Hield-Adebayo swap wouldn’t improve the Warriors’ outside shooting, but it would give them a proven All-Star to pair with Stephen Curry and Draymond Green.

This time, he’s earned his first career NBA 3-point percentage title, becoming just the second player in Hornets history, alongside Glen Rice, to achieve the honor.His brother and the Golden State Warriors veteran, Stephen Curry also shared a congratulatory message. “Congratulations on leading the NBA this season in three-point percentage. Obviously, doing right by the Curry name.”Former NBA star and Seth's father Dell Curry was not keeping his thoughts on his son's achievements to himself. ""Seth Curry, aka SDot. Well, what can I say other than I'm proud of you. Your're my son my golfing buddy, but most importently, my friend. So, congratulations Number 30,"" he said.“Obviously, it’s not something I think about coming into the year or even throughout the year,” Seth said. “I’ve been in the top five a lot of times in my career, but I’ve never finished the year No. 1. It’s a testament to consistent work ethic and being ready. It’s a great accomplishment, something me and my dad have now, and Steph does not have. Yeah, it means a little bit something,” he continued.This season, Seth hit a career-high 45.6% from beyond the arc, knocking down 83 of his 182 attempts.“I think I check my numbers maybe two or three times a year. I’m just going out there, playing the right way, trying to lead this group on and off the floor. If I’m open, be aggressive, make plays, knock down shots. If I’m not, swing it to the open guy. For me, it’s just going out there, playing simple basketball, making my open shots, creating for my teammates and creating space when I can, make it easier on them. Just try to give confidence to the group.”Reflecting on his journey through a challenging season, Seth shared how constant communication with the coaching staff kept him mentally locked in. “The constant communication with coach was good,” he said, explaining how he stayed prepared despite fluctuating minutes. “My adaptability and being able to come in with a rhythm… that’s important,” Curry noted. “Come in, make shots right away – that’s important,” he added.Also Read: “Basketball Gods smiled down” – Magic Johnson sends clear message about NBA playoff matchups for fans Hornets Head Coach Charles Lee also reacted to Seth’s latest milestone. “Very excited for Seth,” Lee said adding, “It’s cool for our organization, but even cooler for him. To achieve that after all the work he’s put in throughout his whole career, I’m very happy for him. I’m grateful for everything he’s given to our team as that veteran leader, but also kudos to our whole organization for investing in player development.”","Curry led the nba with a career-best 45.6% from deep, becoming the second hornets player to do so.

Bombay Sport Exchange Episode 3: Kane Williamson exclusive on NextGen cricketers to watch out for

NEW DELHI: Anaya Bangar , daughter of former India cricketer and coach Sanjay Bangar , has spoken out about the toxic masculinity that continues to plague the cricketing world. In a candid interview, Anaya revealed disturbing experiences she has faced within the cricketing circle, including receiving nude photos from cricketers, verbal abuse, and being propositioned by a former player.Anaya, who publicly came out last year and shared her journey of transformation through hormone replacement therapy and gender-affirming surgery , was formerly known as Aryan. She followed in her father’s footsteps, playing age-group cricket in India. However, she said the journey after transitioning came with many challenges.“There has been support and there have been some harassment as well,” Anaya said during an interview with Lallantop, reflecting on her journey.When asked how fellow cricketers responded after her gender-affirming surgery, Anaya said: “There have been a few cricketers who randomly sent me nude pictures of them.”She also shared more distressing experiences:“The person used to give gaalis in front of everybody. The same person then used to come and sit beside me and ask for my photos. There was another instance, when I was in India, I told a puraane (veteran) cricketer about my situation. He told me let’s go in the car, I want to sleep with you.”Having played alongside prominent Indian cricketers like Musheer Khan, Sarfaraz Khan, and Yashasvi Jaiswal during her early years, Anaya said she was forced to keep her identity hidden because of her father’s public profile.“I had to maintain secrecy about myself because dad is a well known figure. Cricket world is filled with insecurity and toxic masculinity,” she added.Anaya has represented Islam Gymkhana in Mumbai’s club circuit and also played for Hinckley Cricket Club in Leicestershire, UK.However, her cricketing ambitions faced a major setback in November 2023, when the International Cricket Council (ICC) introduced a new policy barring transgender women from participating in international women’s cricket.“Inclusivity is incredibly important to us as a sport, but our priority was to protect the integrity of the international women’s game and the safety of players,” then-ICC CEO Geoff Allardice had said.Anaya responded to the policy with a detailed post on Instagram, expressing her disappointment with the decision.She currently resides in the United Kingdom.",Anaya bangar is the daughter of former india cricketer and coach sanjay bangar.

Seth Rollins wins the triple threat match at WrestleMania 41



Finally, the moment everyone had been waiting for arrived—the main event of the night: a colossal Triple Threat match featuring Seth Rollins Roman Reigns , and CM Punk .All three superstars made electrifying entrances, but it was CM Punk’s that truly stole the spotlight. Walking in alongside Paul Heyman, Punk's entrance marked the first time in years that Roman Reigns entered a match alone—without his ""Wiseman"" by his side.As the bell rang, Punk immediately rolled out of the ring, mocking Reigns by chatting with Heyman about both Roman and Seth. This made Roman furious, while Seth couldn’t help but laugh at the situation. Without wasting a second, Reigns lashed out and struck Rollins.Roman began asserting dominance, unleashing a number of strikes on both Punk and Rollins. But Rollins quickly recovered, launching a suicide dive onto Reigns at ringside and throwing him into the steel steps.The action spilled into the crowd, with Punk and Rollins brawling fiercely. Both superstars took full advantage of the No Disqualification stipulation, battling with steel chairs and trash cans. Punk even slammed Rollins onto a trash can, sending the audience into a frenzy.Just when it seemed like chaos couldn’t get any crazier, Roman Reigns leaped into the crowd, taking down both Rollins and Punk before clearing off the announce table to continue his assault.Back inside the ring, Reigns continued to dominate until Punk reversed a Superman Punch attempt. The momentum shifted in Punk’s favor as he began landing heavy shots on both opponents, even hitting simultaneous DDTs on Reigns and Rollins. Reigns charged in for a Spear, but Punk reversed it into a GTS—only for Reigns to counter, and the two exchanged a brutal series of strikes.Punk then locked Reigns in the Anaconda Vise, but Rollins broke it up with a top-rope splash. Rollins followed up with back-to-back Buckle Bombs on both Punk and Reigns.As the match reached its climax, Rollins lifted Punk for a Pedigree, but Reigns speared Punk mid-move. Reigns then tried to spear Rollins, but Rollins countered mid-air into a Pedigree of his own!Just when Punk was about to deliver a GTS to Rollins, Reigns hit Rollins with a spear—only for Punk to immediately hit Reigns with the GTS. Shockingly, Roman kicked out at two.In a surprising twist, Rollins attempted to convince Reigns to work together and take out Punk. He even suggested performing the classic Shield triple powerbomb, but Reigns turned on Rollins and powerbombed Punk through the announce table himself.And then, everything changed.In one of the most shocking moments in WWE history, Paul Heyman did the unthinkable. He slid a steel chair into the ring, seemingly helping Punk. But just as Punk prepared to strike Reigns, Heyman delivered a low blow to Punk!Heyman then handed the chair to Reigns, appearing to realign himself with the Tribal Chief. But in another jaw-dropping twist, just as Reigns went to attack Rollins, Heyman low-blowed Reigns too!Capitalizing on the moment, Rollins grabbed the steel chair, blasted Reigns with it, and followed up with a devastating Curb Stomp. Rollins pinned Reigns and walked away with the victory in one of the most unpredictable, chaotic, and unforgettable main events in sports entertainment history.","Seth rollins defeated cm punk and roman reigns in a triple threat match at wrestlemania 41.

Jos Buttler Exclusive Interview: I owe Jayawardene for letting me open in T20

Gujarat Titans captain Shubman Gill has been fined Rs 12 lakh for maintaining a slow over-rate during their IPL 2025 match against Delhi Capitals at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on Saturday, marking the team's first over-rate offense of the season.The penalty was imposed under Article 2.22 of the IPL's Code of Conduct, which deals with minimum over-rate offenses. Gill, who was run out for seven runs in the match, joins other captains who have faced similar fines this season.DC's Axar Patel, MI's Hardik Pandya, RR's Riyan Parag and Sanju Samson, and LSG's Rishabh Pant have all previously been fined for over-rate offenses in IPL 2025.Despite the penalty, Gujarat Titans emerged victorious in the match, successfully chasing down 204 runs with four balls remaining in challenging Ahmedabad heat conditions.Jos Buttler played a crucial role in the victory, scoring an unbeaten 97 off 54 balls. He formed significant partnerships of 60 runs with B. Sai Sudharsan and 119 runs with Sherfane Rutherford.The chase marked a historic moment for GT as it was their first successful pursuit of a 200-plus total in their IPL history. It was also the first time any team had chased such a target against Delhi Capitals.GT's bowling attack contributed significantly, with Prasidh Krishna taking 4-41. Mohammed Siraj, Arshad Khan, Ishant Sharma, and R. Sai Kishore each claimed one wicket.The victory has propelled Gujarat Titans, the IPL 2022 champions, to the top of the 2025 season points table with 10 points from seven games. Delhi Capitals currently hold the second position, separated only by net run rate.GT will next face defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders at Eden Gardens on Monday evening, which notably is Gill's former IPL team.","Gujarat titans captain shubman gill has been fined rs 12 lakh for maintaining a slow over-rate during their ipl 2025 match against delhi capitals.

Ukrainian tennis player Tsurenko sues WTA and its chairman for causing ''emotional distress'',https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/europe/ukrainian-tennis-player-tsurenko-sues-wta-and-its-chairman-for-causing-emotional-distress/articleshow/120398859.cms,"Ukrainian tennis player Tsurenko sues WTA and its chairman for causing ''emotional distress''

NEW YORK: Ukrainian tennis player Lesia Tsurenko has filed an amended lawsuit that accuses the WTA Tour and its chairman, Steve Simon , of a breach of contract, negligence and the ""negligent infliction of emotional distress"" because of the way it has handled Russian and Belarusian players amid the war in Ukraine. Tsurenko, who was once among the world's top 25, claims in the lawsuit that WTA executives - including Simon, who was its CEO at the time - failed to follow through on assurances made in a meeting with Ukrainian players that the organization would ban Russian or Belarussian players who publicly supported the war with Ukraine.The amended lawsuit, filed Tuesday in federal court for the Southern District of New York, cited examples such as Russian player Veronika Kudermetova wearing a patch at the French Open for sponsor Taneft, a subsidiary of a company that was sanctioned by the European Union for helping to supply the Russian army.""Despite this promise,"" the lawsuit from Tsurenko claims, ""neither Defendant Steve Simon nor Defendant WTA banned Russian and Belarus players who publicly supported the war.""The WTA said in a statement to The Associated Press on Wednesday that it has been ""steadfast and clear in its condemnation of Russia's war on Ukraine and the actions of the Russian government against the Ukrainian people.""""Consistent with our position,"" the statement said, ""the WTA has taken numerous steps to assist our Ukrainian player members, who have faced great challenges as professional athletes. The WTA has been equally clear that it was founded on principles of equality and non-discrimination and its rules provide that competitions are open to all women players who qualify based on their merit, and without discrimination. Consistent with those principles, and in common with other tennis organizations, the WTA has taken the position that individual athletes should not be penalized for the actions of their governments.""Shortly after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the WTA Tour, ATP Tour and International Tennis Federation issued a joint statement in which it said Russian and Belarusian athletes would be allowed to compete as long as they did not compete under their nation's flags. That policy remains in place with Russian and Belarusian athletes competing at last year's Paris Olympics as ""Individual Neutral Athletes;"" Russian players Mirra Andreeva and Diana Shnaider won silver in women's doubles.Tsurenko's lawsuit states that she was forced to withdraw from an event at Indian Wells because of a panic attack from having to potentially play against Russians and Belarusians, and that she had ""developed excessive stress, loss of concentration affecting her performance at tennis games, mortification and injury to her feelings.""Lindsay Brandon, the WTA director of safeguarding, informed Tsurenko in 2023 that Simon would be investigated for violating its code of conduct. But that October, the organization informed her that Simon had not violated its code nor any provision of the employee handbook. Tsurenko tried to appeal but was unsuccessful.""Even in my worst nightmares, I couldn't imagine that the professional tour, which I considered my home, would become a terrifying and alien place, where the (former) CEO of the organization consciously committed an act of moral abuse against me, leading to a panic attack and my inability to do my job,"" Tsurenko wrote Tuesday on social media.The initial complaint filed in November requests a trial by jury.Proskaeur Rose, the law firm representing the WTA, filed a motion last month to dismiss the case on the grounds that Tsurenko's claims were ""legally defective."" The WTA has until April 30 to decide whether it will continue with its motion to dismiss.""While the WTA has the greatest sympathy for the significant challenges that Ms. Tsurenko and our other Ukrainian athletes have faced,"" its statement said Wednesday, ""we are disappointed that she has decided to engage in litigation to seek to hold the WTA responsible for her distress. At all times, the WTA and its management acted appropriately and in accordance with our rules, and we are confident that we will prevail in this litigation.""","Ukrainian tennis player lesia tsurenko sues wta and its chairman for causing ''emotional distress'' wta says in a statement that it has been ""steadfast and clear in its condemnation of russia's war on ukraine"" the wta has until april 30 to decide whether it will continue with its motion to dismiss.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-120398899,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-787342,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

NEW DELHI: Saturday's IPL 2025 double-header served up two nail-biters, with Jos Buttler and Avesh Khan playing lead roles in contrasting fashion to guide Gujarat Titans and Lucknow Super Giants to memorable wins over Delhi Capitals and Rajasthan Royals, respectively.In Ahmedabad, Buttler weathered cramps and unleashed a blistering unbeaten 97 off 54 balls to steer Gujarat Titans to a seven-wicket victory over Delhi Capitals.Chasing 204, GT overcame early hiccups with Shubman Gill and B Sai Sudharsan departing early, but Buttler anchored the chase alongside Sherfane Rutherford (43), the pair adding a match-turning 119-run stand for the third wicket.Buttler’s knock was a masterclass in timing and power; he famously took apart Mitchell Starc for five consecutive boundaries in the 15th over, blending classical strokeplay with brute efficiency.Despite missing out on a hundred, Buttler ensured the chase ended with four balls to spare as Rahul Tewatia finished things in style.Earlier, Prasidh Krishna’s 4/41 helped restrict DC to 203/8 despite fighting knocks from Axar Patel (39) and Ashutosh Sharma (37 off 19).In Jaipur, Avesh Khan delivered under extreme pressure, defending nine runs in the final over as Lucknow Super Giants eked out a two-run win against Rajasthan Royals.RR, chasing 181, were coasting at 156/2 in 17 overs with a blazing Yashasvi Jaiswal (74) and 14-year-old debutant Vaibhav Suryavanshi (34) setting the tone.But Avesh’s deadly 18th over, removing Jaiswal and Riyan Parag, turned the game on its head.With nine needed off the final six, Avesh dismissed Shimron Hetmyer and conceded just six runs, finishing with 3/37 and sealing a heist win for LSG.Earlier, Aiden Markram (66) and Ayush Badoni (50) helped LSG post a competitive 180/5, with Abdul Samad’s 10-ball 30 lifting them past 175.The wins saw Gujarat Titans climb to the top of the table, while Lucknow Super Giants revived their campaign with a gritty, last-over triumph that will be talked about for days.",Gujarat titans beat delhi capitals by seven wickets in ipl 2025.

Rangers fire Head Coach, but front office missteps fuel deeper crisis



In a move that’s more scapegoat than solution, the New York Rangers fired head coach Peter Laviolette on Saturday and with it, tried to wash their hands of one of the most embarrassing collapses in recent franchise history. After a record-setting 2022-23 season, the Rangers didn’t just miss the playoffs in 2024, they imploded. And rather than admit the problem runs deeper than the bench, GM Chris Drury seems content pinning it all on the coaching staff.Let’s call it what it is: the Rangers' issues didn’t start or end with Peter Laviolette. Yes, the team underperformed. Yes, their power play was abysmal. But to act like the man behind the bench is the root of the problem is a convenient narrative that protects the real culprits, the ones in suits, not skates.Drury’s roster decisions were puzzling all season long. Trading captain Jacob Trouba mid-season raised eyebrows. Shipping off Kaapo Kakko and Filip Chytil while shuffling in new faces like J.T. Miller and Carson Soucy only added to the instability. And let’s not forget the March deadline moves that felt more like desperation than direction. The chemistry never clicked because the pieces kept changing and that’s not on Laviolette.Worse yet, the Rangers are now part of a not-so-proud club, one of only four teams in NHL history to win the Presidents’ Trophy and miss the playoffs the very next season. That’s not just a stumble. That’s a structural failure.Still, Drury insists his job is safe and that “it starts with me.” But if it truly started with him, he wouldn’t be dodging questions about ownership’s confidence. He wouldn’t be pushing the narrative that a new coach, whether it’s a recycled NHL name or an unproven college upstart, is the magic fix.Also Read: Penguins duo Sidney Crosby and Evgeni Malkin set rivalry aside, celebrate Alex Ovechkin’s historic goal record with Rolex gift And where does this leave the locker room? A rotating door of coaches, a confused roster, and now a fanbase expected to trust that the next hire will right the ship. The truth is, the Rangers' problems won’t be solved with a new face behind the bench. Until the front office owns up to its missteps, New York is chasing shadows.The Rangers didn’t just fire Laviolette. They lit the fuse on a bigger crisis.","New york rangers fire head coach peter laviolette after collapse. Gm chris drury seems content pinning it all on the coaching staff.
