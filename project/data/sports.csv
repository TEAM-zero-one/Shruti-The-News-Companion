Seventeen years later, India returned to the summit in 2024, with Rohit Sharma leading the side to a memorable title win.

Pakistan batter Babar Azam drew fresh online criticism during his team’s Group A match against Namibia national cricket team at the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup 2026 in Colombo after he did not get a chance to bat.The experienced batter, long seen as one of Pakistan’s leading run-scorers, has struggled for form in the competition. On X and other platforms, fans have questioned why he has not made an impact, even when opportunities might have arisen earlier in the tournament.The 31-year-old had originally been picked as a fail-safe option. He was expected to anchor the innings at number four and steady the side if wickets fell, an area where Pakistan have faced problems in the past.However, against the Netherlands and India, he did not play that role effectively when Pakistan's batting collapsed. In the must-win game against Namibia, Pakistan made a strong start, and team management — including coach Mike Hesson and captain Salman Ali Agha — chose to send more aggressive batters ahead of him.Pakistan lost their second wicket, that of skipper Agha, in the 13th over. Instead of sending Babar at number four, Khawaja Nafay was promoted.Even after Nafay managed only 5 off 5 balls, Babar was still not sent in. Shadab Khan joined Sahibzada Farhan in the middle instead.Online reaction was swift, with users posting memes, questions and criticism about his lack of runs and Pakistan’s batting approach.""Babar Azam ko team puri krny ke liay khilaya gaya hai?"" asked one viewer.Another user edited a well-known “depression mein hain” video using Babar’s voice after his demotion.A third user wrote on X, ""I think babar azam is promoted as finisher.""In the match, Pakistan rode on Sahibzada Farhan's scintillating, maiden hundred and their spinners' excellent display to beat Namibia by a handsome margin of 102 runs and enter the Super Eights of the T20 World Cup on Wednesday.","Pakistan batter babar azam drew fresh online criticism during his team’s group a match against namibia national cricket team.

Chris Hemsworth names Georges St-Pierre and Alexander Volkanovski as favorite UFC stars while joking about his dream MMA fight

Chris Hemsworth is known around the world for playing Thor, but away from movies, the Australian actor has another passion, mixed martial arts. In a recent conversation with Academy Award winner Halle Berry during a Complex video segment, Hemsworth openly talked about how long he has trained and how much he respects MMA. He said he has spent years sparring and learning, even though he understands how difficult real fighting can be.The actor surprised fans when he admitted that he would love to step into a real MMA fight someday. While speaking honestly, he also joked about how things might go for him inside the cage. The discussion quickly turned into a fun chat about favourite UFC fighters, showing how deeply both actors follow the sport and respect the athletes who compete at the highest level.During the conversation, Chris Hemsworth was asked who his ideal MMA opponent would be. Instead of giving a serious answer, he joked and said it would be someone who retired long ago so he could run around until they got tired.Still, he made it clear that he genuinely respects the sport and has trained for years.He explained, “I’ve trained a lot and sparred a lot of years but within the realm of not killing each other. Love to just one day go ‘right, what have I done here?,’ I’d probably end up flat on my back, starry eyes.”Hemsworth also shared the fighters he admires most.He mentioned former UFC champion Georges St-Pierre, praising his intelligence and gentleman-like personality. He also named Alexander Volkanovski, calling the Australian champion a friend and someone he respects deeply in the sport.Halle Berry, who starred in the MMA-themed film Bruised, also joined the discussion by naming Anderson Silva, Sean O’Malley, and Valentina Shevchenko as her favourites.Her film earned praise from UFC president Dana White and featured Shevchenko in a role, which helped connect Hollywood and MMA even more. Hemsworth has shown his interest in combat sports before.He attended UFC 243, where Israel Adesanya defeated Robert Whittaker in the main event. Around the same period, while promoting Thor: Ragnarok, Hemsworth humorously claimed that the fight between Thor and Hulk was bigger than the famous Conor McGregor vs. Floyd Mayweather Jr. boxing event, showing his playful side toward combat sports hype.","Chris hemsworth is known around the world for playing thor, but away from movies, the australian actor has another passion, mixed martial arts.

Kyrie Irving shares emotional message as Mavericks star confirms season-ending recovery decision

Mavericks struggle without Kyrie Irving as Dallas shifts focus toward rebuilding phase

As he continues to recuperate from knee surgery in March, Kyrie Irving, a standout for the Dallas Mavericks, will miss the rest of the season, his agent informed ESPN's Shams Charania. Irving hasn't played this season since undergoing surgery in March to repair a ruptured left ACL. Anticipated to return for the 2026–2027 season is the nine-time All-Star.Considering that the Mavs are in full tank mode, it is hardly a major surprise. However, the 33-year-old will not play this season as he continues to recover from the ACL tear he sustained in March, according to a press release from the organization.Officially, Kyrie Irving will miss the season. Shetellia Riley Irving, his agent, informed Charania:""This is about Kyrie being 1,000% when he comes back and giving himself the best chance to chase a championship next season,""Irving said in that release:“This decision wasn’t easy, but it’s the right one.. I am grateful for the Mavericks organization, my teammates and our fans for their continued support throughout the process. I am looking forward to coming back stronger next season. The belief and drive I have inside only grows…”He continued:“And I wanted to send a huge shoutout to ALL of my brothers and sisters out there who’ve torn their ACL or gotten injured doing what they love to do every day. THANK YOU for the inspiration. No fear!”For the rest of the season, Irving will continue his recuperation under the guidance of the Mavericks' performance and medical staff.Irving and the team reached a three-year, $119 million contract in June 2025 while he continues to recuperate. For the rest of this season, he will continue in rehab under the care of the Mavs' performance and medical staff.However, he has already missed the last 20 games of the previous campaign due to a knee injury. Since the 15-year veteran joined the team in the 2022–2023 season, the Mavericks are 75–53 when Irving is in the lineup. On the other hand, they are only 42-75 when Irving is not present.The Mavericks have a 19-35 record going into the post-All-Star break stretch of their schedule, which puts them fourth in the Southwest Division. Dallas announced its plan to rebuild earlier this month with the trade of Anthony Davis, who was sold to the Washington Wizards in a nine-player blockbuster.","Kyrie irving will miss the rest of the season, his agent informed espn's shams charania.

Doug Moe’s financial standing and career earnings

Doug Moe’s career and statistical milestones

The basketball world is mourning the loss of legendary player and coach Doug Moe. After a long battle with cancer, Moe passed away on February 17, 2026, at the age of 87 in San Antonio.From a 117-135 record with Spurs over 4 seasons(1976-1980) to a decade-long tenure with Nuggets (1980–1990), Moe was known for his high speed passing game offense, and “do whatever the hell you want"" mindset over rigid set plays. He led the Nuggets to nine consecutive playoff appearances (1981-1990) and set a franchise record of 432 regular-season wins, and also earned the 1988 NBA Coach of the Year award and the prestigious Chuck Daly Lifetime Achievement Award in 2018.While Moe’s private net worth was never made official, his financial empire was mainly built on decades of coaching contracts and as a premier ABA star. An iconic moment of his coaching career that encapsulated Moe’s personality is the September 1990 press conference when he appeared in a Hawaiian shirt after being fired by the Nuggets. Moe and his wife, Jane, celebrated in front of the media as the Nuggets were still obligated to pay out the remaining years of his contract.Moe was signed on a 4-year extension that would have kept him in Denver through the 1992-93 season.Moe’s financial legacy is also tied to his early years in the ABA, where he was one of the league’s premier stars. His ""432"" banner still hangs in the rafters of Ball Arena, cementing his place as the Nuggets’ winningest coach (former).Moe’s journey began as a fierce competitor in the American Basketball Association (ABA). From 1967 to 1972, he played 5 seasons and scored 6,161 career points, with an average of 16.3 points, 6.8 rebounds, and 3.2 assists per game. He shot at an efficiency of 42.8% from the floor and 80.0% from the FT line. He earned three ABA All-Star honors and helped carry the Oakland Oaks to a championship in 1969.The 1961 point-shaving scandal put a target on Moe’s back, and despite being exonerated, he was banned from playing in the NBA. But as a coach, Moe spent fifteen seasons in the NBA and recorded 628-529. During his golden years with Denver, the team led the league in scoring six times, with five being in consecutive seasons.","Moe was known for his high speed passing game offense, and “do whatever the hell you want"" mindset over rigid set plays.

Mikaela Shiffrin and Aleksander Aamodt Kilde show strong support after emotional Olympic gold

Mikaela Shiffrin finally got the moment she had been chasing for years. The American skier won gold in the women’s slalom at the Milan Cortina Winter Olympics on February 18, ending a long Olympic medal drought. Her victory was dominant, emotional, and historic. Soon after the race, congratulations poured in including a short but meaningful message from her Norwegian fiancé, Aleksander Aamodt Kilde, who wrote on Instagram, “She did it again.”The win was important because Shiffrin came into these Games with pressure and doubts after leaving Beijing 2022 without a medal. Earlier events in Milan were also disappointing, including an 11th-place giant slalom finish and a near miss in the team event. But in slalom, her strongest discipline, she delivered. Shiffrin finished with a combined time of 1:39.10, winning by 1.50 seconds over Switzerland’s Camille Rast, while Sweden’s Anna Swenn Larsson took bronze. The margin was one of the biggest seen in Olympic alpine skiing in decades.Mikaela Shiffrin’s gold also showed how much support she has around her. Kilde is missing the Olympics due to injuries following a serious crash and long recovery, but he publicly celebrated her success with pride.Team USA skier Breezy Johnson wrote, “So proud of this lady!!! 2x slalom champ!!!!” while Lindsey Vonn also shared congratulations online. For Shiffrin, this was more than just a medal.This became her third Olympic gold and fourth Olympic medal overall, making her the first American alpine skier to win three Olympic golds.She also became the first U.S. skier to win Olympic slalom twice, joining Swiss legend Vreni Schneider in that rare achievement. After crossing the finish line, Shiffrin dropped down with emotion before raising her fists to the crowd.She later said, “Today I showed up for the skiing. I wanted to have two runs with really strong slalom skiing… to also get to have a medal is unbelievable.”The moment felt bigger because she has openly talked about tough years, including injuries and mental struggles after past crashes.Through all of it, she and Kilde have supported each other. Their shared journey made this Olympic gold feel personal not just for the result, but for everything it took to get there.","Mikaela shiffrin won gold in the women’s slalom at the milan cortina winter olympics.

His team's performance in Tuesday night's 82-59 loss to Michigan State did not satisfy him.Cronin was questioned about the chanting at Xavier Booker, a former Spartan player who transferred to UCLA, by the Michigan State student section. So, a question he got during his postgame news conference may have made him even more irate.Tuesday night, UCLA lost to No. 15 Michigan State by more than 20 points for the second time in a row. During the game, Bruins coach Mick Cronin seemed to remove one of his own players.UCLA center Steven Jamerson II, a former Michigan State student, was punished for a flagrant after fouling Carson Cooper from behind on a dunk attempt with 4:26 remaining in the Bruins' 82-59 defeat, with the team down 77-50.Michigan State supporters yelled the name of former five-star prospect Xavier Booker, a center for the Boston Bruins, during the game. After the game, Cronin got into a heated argument with a reporter who inquired about the Booker chants, saying:""I could give a rat's ass about the other team's student section. I would like to give you a kudos for the worst question I've ever been asked.. You really think I care about the other team's student section?”Cronin then accused the reporter of ""raising your voice at me."" Cronin said:""Yeah, you are.. Everybody is standing here listening to you.Everybody. This is on camera. They can hear you. I answered the question. I can give a rat's ass about the other team's student section.""When UCLA lost against the Michigan State Spartans 82-59, the coach's fury erupted in a way that Bruins supporters hardly ever saw. With just over four minutes left, UCLA center Steven Jamerson II fouled Carson Cooper hard during a dunk attempt, causing the team to fall behind 77-50. Authorities determined a flagrant. Cronin got farther.Cronin then explained after the game:""You know, true toughness is how you compete and how you go to work every day. Steve's a good kid. He made a bad decision… But if you want to be a tough guy, you need to do it during the game, for a blockout, for a rebound…”He said:""So, I was thoroughly disappointed; the guy was defenseless in the air. I know Steve was trying to block the shot, but the game's a 25-point game. You don't do that.""Coach Tom Izzo of the Spartans, whose team improved to 21-5, 11-4 in the Big Ten, had never seen such a strange situation before. Izzo made a joke:""I guess he upgraded that to a flagrant 2, huh?.. That's the first time I saw a coach do it, but that sounds like Mick. So, he'll get that straightened out.""Since then, the incident has gone viral, igniting a discussion on topics like player discipline, pure coaching ethics, and how to handle the growing frustrations within the Bruins team as they strive to earn a spot in the NCAA tournament.He opened himself when questioned about the chants after the game. He referred to it as the worst question he had ever received. He questioned the tone. He gave a forceful shove back. To put things in perspective, UCLA had just suffered a 30-point loss to No. 1 Michigan over the weekend.The Bruins are now 17-9 overall and 9-6 in Big Ten play after suffering yet another setback by more than 20 points, this time to a highly regarded Michigan State squad. Westwood hasn't had consecutive blowouts like this in many generations.","Ucla lost 82-59 to no. 15 michigan state on tuesday night.

Sidney Crosby exits after heavy collision, medical concerns mount

Team Canada adapts, but questions loom ahead of semifinal

Team Canada’s quest for Olympic gold at the Milano Cortina Winter Games took a bizarre and scary turn when captain Sidney Crosby had to exit a nail-biting quarter-final clash with Czechia early due to injury. The experienced forward left early in the second period following a heavy hit, sending alarm bells through the Canadian bench and fans watching in a high-pressure contest.Crosby's absence loomed large over the rest of the game with hopes of medals on the line. While Canada did eventually fight back to win in overtime, attention soon turned from the final score to the status of the team's leader and emotional pillar as the tourney reached its critical stretch.Crosby fell into the boards after getting caught between two Czech defenders while going through the neutral zone with the puck during a physical sequence. He stayed on the ice a few moments, then skated slowly to the bench and off down the tunnel under his own power. Later, team officials said he would not return due to a lower-body injury and would be re-evaluated.When he left, Canada was chasing in a game for the first time all tournament, an unusual spot for a team that is all about speed, depth, and experience at this level.Crosby had already made significant defensive and offensive contributions, playing heavy minutes and centering Canada’s top line. The unexpected absence forced head coach Jon Cooper to rearrange lines in a pinch, squeezing younger forwards into heavier minutes and responsibility roles.While that was a punch to the gut, Canada recovered, equalizing late in the game and clinching the win in overtime. Players spoke afterward about rallying around one another and feeding off the loss of their captain to spur each other on, but the reverberations of the celebrations were tempered by disbelief. Finding a replacement for Crosby, a captain who excels in the faceoff circle and has a knack for staying calm under pressure, isn’t going to happen easily, particularly with the competition heating up.With a semifinal on the horizon for Canada, the team must now wait for medical reports from trainers to help set strategy and expectations. Crosby was always going to be a big part of Canada’s gold-medal push, but his injury at least injects a bit of vulnerability, regardless of whether he returns to the lineup. With margins tightening and foes stiffening, the next few days may decide if Canada's Olympic fate rests on recovery, reinvention, or both.","Sidney crosby left early in the second period after a heavy hit.

As per reports, Connor McDavid tallied two assists, tying the Olympic record with NHL players at 11 points, while, unfortunately, Crosby went into the locker room after sustaining an injury.The player was injured five minutes into the second period after his right leg bent in an awkward direction after taking a hit from Czech defenceman Radko Gudas during the match. Earlier, Crosby set the record for points by a Canadian NHLer at the Olympics in Sunday’s 10-2 victory over France.According to TSN, Canada won Olympic gold with its NHL stars in 2002, 2010, and 2014 before the league skipped the 2018 event. It is to be noted that the Czechs’ only victory over Canada at an Olympics came during a semifinal shootout at the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan, as reported by TSN. It will now be interesting to see if Canada can book a spot at the final of the Olympic Games this year.","Mitch marner’s heroic contribution has led team canada to secure a spot at the olympic semifinal.

Gardner’s new Heat deal includes conditional guarantees as undrafted wing earns bigger NBA opportunity

Heat rookie Myron Gardner impresses with strong play and G League numbers as Miami plans bigger role

As Myron Gardner transitions out of his Two-Way contract, he and the Miami Heat have reached an agreement on a three-year conventional NBA contract. The Heat promoted Swingman to fill the void on their 15-man roster. Myron Gardner from his two-way contract, the organization said in a news release today.Agent Jake Cohen informs NBA source Chris Haynes that Gardner and the Heat have negotiated a three-year contract. Gardner has made 26 appearances with the Heat this season, averaging 9.8 minutes with 4.2 points, 3.0 rebounds, and 1.0 assists.Anthony Chiang of The Miami Herald claims that the contract won't be guaranteed beyond this season. The second- and third-year guarantees, according to Chiang, are ""conditional,"" meaning Gardner must stay under contract until specific dates in order to get his full compensation for those seasons.Chris Haynes wrote:“Miami Heat and swingman Myron Gardner have reached an agreement on a three-year deal, his agent Jake Cohen of Iconic Sports Management tells me. The undrafted rookie earns a standard deal after playing stellar on a two-way contract…”Gardner, a 2023 undrafted graduate of Arkansas-Little Rock, played for the G League's Osceola Magic for two seasons until agreeing to a two-year deal with Miami in July.After seeing little involvement during the first two months of the season, the wing has since been thrown into a starting role and has seen more activity since the beginning of January.Gardner had four starts in his final seven games up to the All-Star break, averaging 17.7 minutes per night with 7.0 points and 6.0 rebounds and shooting.474/.444/.714 from the field.Gardner, who had a two-way contract before, has so far made a big impression on the Heat.

Despite having a complete 15-man roster, the Heat still have space below the luxury tax line, according to Ira Winderman of The South Florida Sun Sentinel.If they so choose, they can sign another free agent in the upcoming weeks.

Toronto Maple Leafs recall defenseman William Villeneuve during the Winter Olympics 2026

William Villeneuve | Practice | January 30, 2026

The Toronto Maple Leafs have recently recalled a promising defenseman, William Villeneuve, from the AHL's Toronto Marlies, providing him a key opportunity to be a part of the club in the NHL, amid the Winter Olympics break. As reported by the club, Villeneuve was called up by the Maple Leafs on Wednesday.This opportunity came for Villeneuve as the Toronto Maple Leafs have taken on players taking part in the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan. As per reports, amidst this Olympic break, the NHL squad has returned to practice this week. It is to be noted that Villeneuve is a fourth-round pick in the 2020 NHL Draft.As per reports, he has spent four professional seasons with the Marlies, amassing 12 goals and 96 assists in 203 AHL games. Last season, he broke out with 40 points (4 goals, 36 assists) in 55 games, leading the team's defense in scoring and posting a +17 rating.To strengthen the team’s defense line, the Toronto Maple Leafs have recently announced that they’ve recalled defenseman William Villeneuve from the AHL's Toronto Marlies during the ongoing Olympic Games. The decision was made to add an extra defenseman at the practices for the time being while they await Oliver Ekman-Larsson‘s return, who is currently representing Sweden at the Olympics.Though Villeneuve has prior experience in the AHL, the 23-year-old player doesn't have any NHL experience yet. As per reports, Villeneuve played 55 games last season for the Marlies and recorded 36 assists. In addition to this, he has also recorded four goals and 40 points in 55 games during the 2024-25 campaign, before registering two assists in two playoff games.In this season, he has scored around 18 points through 40 games, and also has recorded 3 goals and 15 assists with the Marlies, despite the team's struggles. It is to be noted that the 23-year-old is also ranked as Toronto's second-best defensive prospect, as claimed by Terry Koshan of the Toronto Sun. But, his puck-moving skills address a need on the Leafs' blue line beyond Ekman-Larsson and Morgan Rielly.Reports suggest that for now, William Villeneuve will be only allowed to take part in the Leafs practices while the roster is short-staffed, marking his first promotion this year. As Toronto is facing challenges and a potential trade deadline shuffle, signs show that Villeneuve could make an NHL debut soon, boosting his path to the big club.","The toronto maple leafs have recalled william villeneuve from the ahl's toronto marlies.
