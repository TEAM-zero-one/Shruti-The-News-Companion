NEW DELHI: Temba Bavuma not only led South Africa to a historic ICC triumph after 27 years, but he also became the subject of countless memes as fans flooded social media with humorous and heartfelt tributes.The Proteas skipper guided his team to their maiden ICC World Test Championship (WTC) title, clinching a five-wicket win over Australia at Lord’s.Since the victory, memes celebrating South Africa’s long-awaited ICC triumph have taken over the internet. Here are some of the best.But beyond the jokes and memes celebrating Bavuma’s calm demeanour and emotional post-match interview, the moment marked a defining chapter in South African cricket.At the presentation, Bavuma was quick to credit his teammates for the landmark victory.He heaped praise on Kagiso Rabada , who claimed nine wickets in the match, including a crucial five-for in the first innings.Despite returning from a one-month ban for recreational drug use, Rabada delivered when it mattered most, surpassing Allan Donald to become South Africa’s fourth-highest Test wicket-taker.Bavuma also hailed Aiden Markram , whose majestic 136 anchored the Proteas’ record-breaking chase.“People have questioned Aiden’s place, but he showed character. KG will surely be in the Hall of Fame one day,” Bavuma said, reflecting the deep camaraderie in the side.Rabada, visibly emotional, described the victory as a culmination of years of frustration and near-misses for South African cricket. “We’ve seen the heartbreak over the years. This is for our past players and our people back home. Hopefully this is just the beginning,” he said.The match itself was a rollercoaster.After bowling out Australia for 212 on day one, the Proteas collapsed to 138, handing the Aussies a 74-run lead.But a fiery second-innings bowling effort and Markram’s sublime knock sealed the chase of 282.Kyle Verreynne’s winning shot sent the crowd into raptures, while Bavuma memes lit up the internet, turning the captain into both a hero and a viral sensation.","Temba bavuma led south africa to a historic icc triumph after 27 years.

How Wiggins Fits With LeBron and Doncic





Theare weighing their options this offseason, and according to a popular NBA analyst, one potential move involves swapping a key forward for a proven NBA champion.The Los Angeles Lakers have two clear paths in free agency: pursuing a dominant center or trading for an experienced wing player to bolster their championship aspirations. According to recent reports, the franchise may lean toward the latter by targeting Miami Heat star Andrew Wiggins.Lake Show Life’s Svyatoslav Rovenchuk suggests the Lakers could package forward Rui Hachimura in a deal to acquire Wiggins from the Miami Heat.""The fit of Rui Hachimura alongside (Luka) Doncic and (LeBron) James has quickly come under scrutiny after a premature first-round exit to the Minnesota Timberwolves,"" Rovenchuk wrote. ""This has led many to believe the Lakers are better off trading the starting forward."" (H/t: Sporting News)Andrew Wiggins could provide the Los Angeles Lakers with much-needed perimeter scoring and defensive versatility. Here’s why this trade could work:- Salary Match: Hachimura ($17 million) plus another expiring contract could match Wiggins’ $28.2 million salary for 2025-26.- Proven Playoff Performer: Wiggins was instrumental in Golden State’s 2022 title run, averaging 17.2 points and 4.5 rebounds per game.- Immediate Upgrade: While Hachimura is solid, Wiggins offers better two-way impact and championship experience.Once considered an underachieving talent in Minnesota, Wiggins revitalized his career with the Golden State Warriors . His improved motor and efficiency made him a key piece in Golden State’s success.However, after a slow start in 2024-25, the Warriors traded him to Miami in the Jimmy Butler deal.Wiggins’ skill set complements the Lakers’ star duo:- Reliable three-point shooting for better floor spacing.- Strong perimeter defense to ease the load on LeBron James.- Playoff-tested mentality, crucial for deep postseason runs.With the Heat struggling, Wiggins may welcome a move to a contender like the Lakers.While Hachimura has been a steady presence, Wiggins represents a clear upgrade for a Los Angeles Lakers team in win-now mode. If Los Angeles can structure the right deal, adding the former Warriors champion could be the move that pushes them back into title contention.","The los angeles lakers have two clear paths in free agency: pursuing a dominant center or trading for an experienced wing player.

Tyrese Haliburton fires back at critics, Stephen A. Smith takes it personally in fiery rant



Hilarious fan reactions to ‘ Dumb and Dumber ’ trolling of Stephen A. Smith and Kendrick Perkins at Game 4







Sometimes, the loudest message in a Finals game doesn’t come from a superstar or a coach—it comes from the stands. During Game 4 of the 2025 NBA Finals at Gainbridge Fieldhouse, while most fans rocked gold Pacers shirts, two individuals turned heads with bold fashion choices straight out of a comedy classic. Dressed in Dumb and Dumber-style tuxedos—one bright orange, one electric blue—they topped it off with oversized face cutouts of ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith and Kendrick Perkins. It was a hilarious, pointed response to recent media criticism of Pacers guard Tyrese Haliburton—and fans online immediately took notice.The media heat on Tyrese Haliburton started after Game 2, when he was criticized for his passiveness in a 107–123 Pacers loss. On “First Take”, ESPN’s Stephen A. Smith didn’t hold back. “Win the damn chip, bro… That ain’t on me. That’s on you,” he said, implying Haliburton wasn’t delivering when it mattered. Smith continued, “Just in case he was talking about me—my brother, I'm not going away… this train don’t stop.”Then came Game 3. Haliburton bounced back with 22 points, 11 assists, and 9 rebounds in a 116–107 Pacers win. After the game, he was asked about the media noise. He didn’t name names but made his feelings clear: “Most of the time, the talking heads on the major platforms, I couldn’t care less honestly. Like, what do they really know about basketball?” Kendrick Perkins , speaking on NBA Today, gave Haliburton credit for stepping up.“He finally arrived to the NBA Finals—to us box score watchers,” Perkins said. He even acknowledged, “He outplayed SGA.”And then came Game 4, when two fans used fashion to flip the script. Their orange and blue tuxes carried double meaning: orange symbolizing Smith’s New York Knicks loyalty, and blue a nod to the Oklahoma City Thunder—Perkins’ former team. It was comedy, commentary, and petty brilliance all rolled into one.Fans took to X with no shortage of reactions to the trolling masterclass.One fan said: “Absolutely incredible troll job by Pacers fans dressed as Stephen A. Smith and Kendrick Perkins. Dumb and Dumber tuxedos and all.”This tweet captured the moment perfectly and praised the fans for the elite-level trolling and creative execution.A second user chimed in with: “Two guys in the front row at the Pacers game dressed like Dumb and Dumber with Stephen A Smith and Kendrick Perkins faces on their suits.”This user highlighted the boldness of the fans’ courtside position, emphasizing how visible and intentional the troll job was.Another user joked: “Are these two guys front row at the Pacers game calling Stephen A Smith and Kendrick Perkins Dumb and Dumber?”This tweet added playful speculation, bluntly asking if the fans were deliberately labeling the ESPN duo as the classic comedy characters.One more said:“Best thing I’ve seen tonight…. Dumb and Dumber at the Pacer game tonight!”This comment called the bit the highlight of the evening—more memorable than even the on-court action for some viewers.And finally, another user said:“Pretty sure these fans are in Dumb and Dumber costumes…with face cutouts of Stephen A Smith and Kendrick Perkins.”This tweet added to the confirmation and appreciation of the stunt, acknowledging the detail in the fans’ outfits and execution.Also Read: Tyrese Haliburton shares heartwarming moment with Obi Toppin’s daughter before crucial Indiana Pacers vs. Oklahoma City Thunder NBA Finals Game 4 From Tyrese Haliburton shrugging off criticism to two fans turning sports talk into visual satire, Game 4 of the NBA Finals was about more than basketball. It became a statement on media narratives, on confidence, and on the creative passion of Indiana’s fan base. With subtle symbolism in every stitch of those tuxedos, the message was clear: Indiana hears the noise, and they know exactly how to laugh back.

Jasson Dominguez’s error hurts Yankees in close game

Fans doubt Dominguez is ready for the majors

Young star faces high expectations





Jasson Dominguez, a young Yankees star made a huge error that angered fans during a game against the Boston Red Sox. He froze on the bases, costing his team a chance to score. ""I mean what the f**k are you DOING. Dominguez should be benched tomorrow for this alone I’m sorry. Completely inexcusable and unacceptable,"" one fan posted angrily on social media.During the seventh inning of the Yankees’ 4-3 loss to the Red Sox on June 14, 2025, Jasson Dominguez made a costly mistake. He was on second base when Trent Grisham swung at a pitch. Dominguez thought Grisham struck out and stopped running, but Grisham hadn’t.This confusion meant Dominguez didn’t advance, missing a chance to put runners on second and third with Aaron Judge up next. The inning ended without a score, frustrating fans. Dominguez said after the game, “I have nothing to say. No excuses. I made a mistake.” Fans were quick to react online, with one saying, “Send him back to the minors or trade him.”Another posted, “Jasson Dominguez may rank among the game’s all time overhyped prospects.” The mistake added to doubts about Dominguez’s focus, as the Yankees fight for a playoff spot.Dominguez’s error wasn’t the only thing upsetting fans during the Red Sox series.His defense has been shaky, and he’s struggled at the plate at times. One fan wrote, “Speaking of being asleep, how does Jasson get picked off second base. WTF.” Manager Aaron Boone defended other players, like Anthony Volpe, who also made a baserunning mistake, but fans weren’t happy. They even criticized Boone, with one saying, “Yesterday completely unnecessary and now this again. ”Even with Dominguez's very good minor-league resumé like .314 hitting and 11 home runs in 2024, he has been an inconsistent big-league player. The fans are divided: some want him sent to the minors for refinement while others see him still as a potential star.Also Read: Jasson Dominguez's net worth in 2025 - Exploring career earnings, salary details, and everything else His youth and inexperience-weighing in just at 22 major-league games-are said to be working against him in waning moments when he needs to grow more. But the spotlight is on Dominguez; pressure is mounting for him to prove his worth.Jasson Dominguez, called “The Martian” for his amazing talent signed with the Yankees for $5.1 million in 2019 when he was just 16. Fans expected him to be a superstar like Mike Trout after he hit a home run in his first MLB at-bat in 2023. But injuries like Tommy John surgery and an oblique strain have slowed him down.In 2025, he hit three home runs in one game against the Athletics showing his power but mistakes like the one against the Red Sox have hurt his reputation. Boone believes Dominguez will learn from these errors, but fans want results now.With the Yankees aiming for the playoffs every game matters and Dominguez’s performance is under close watch. Can he overcome these challenges and become the star fans hoped for? His next games will be key to answering that question.","Yankees fans lose patience with jasson dominguez after embarrassing mistake against red sox.

South African legend AB de Villiers has opened up about his tumultuous time with the now-defunct Delhi Daredevils (now Delhi Capitals), calling his early IPL years a bittersweet chapter clouded by internal chaos. Despite boasting an array of cricketing legends, Delhi never made it past the semi-finals during de Villiers' stint from 2008 to 2010.“There were a lot of poisonous characters in that team,” de Villiers revealed in an interview with Cricket.com. “I'd hate to give you names - burning people, you know - but the Delhi Daredevils were in shambles.”De Villiers made the playoffs with Delhi in 2008 and 2009 and was one of the team's standout performers, scoring 465 runs in the 2009 season held in South Africa. However, his role diminished in 2010, and to his surprise, he found himself in the auction pool ahead of 2011.“I thought I was going to be the man,” he recalled. “Then, all of a sudden, I wasn't playing again… I was told I would be retained, and then the next minute, I saw myself in the auction. I didn't even know what had happened. So many weird things went on.”Despite the bitter fallout, de Villiers fondly remembers sharing the dressing room with icons like Glenn McGrath and Daniel Vettori “Some of the highlights of my life and career came during that stint,” he said.De Villiers went on to become one of the most beloved and successful players in IPL history with Royal Challengers Bengaluru, amassing over 5000 runs. “The day I walked into RCB, I felt like they wanted me,” he said. “You're going to become a great player with us - you're part of the family.”",Ab de villiers has opened up about his time with the delhi daredevils.

Poll Should Shubman Gill prioritize a strong bowling attack over batting depth? Yes, bowling is crucial No, batting depth is more important It depends on the conditions I’m not sure

Yashasvi Jaiswal's Coach on England Prep, Opening Partner, & Playing Under Gill





As India gear up to face England in the first Test of the five-match series starting June 20 at Headingley, former cricketer Aakash Chopra has cautioned against compromising bowling potency for batting depth.Speaking on his YouTube channel, Chopra urged the team management, led by new Test captain Shubman Gill , to avoid repeating selection mistakes made in the Border-Gavaskar Trophy.“We got a learning from the Border-Gavaskar Trophy that if you get a little obsessed about the batting and play batters who can bowl and choose bowlers who can bat, then you are just going down the wrong path,” Chopra said, underlining the need for a more incisive bowling attack.India's 18-member squad includes five specialist pacers, two seam-bowling all-rounders, one frontline spinner, and two spin-bowling all-rounders. Chopra believes a minimum of three specialist fast bowlers should feature in the XI.“So I am thinking you should have a minimum of three proper fast bowlers. The fourth fast bowler could be Shardul Thakur for sure, if you wish, and then you can have Nitish Kumar Reddy as the fifth bowler and Ravindra Jadeja as the sixth bowler.So you have plenty of bowling options, but the batting is not compromised,” he explained.Alternatively, Chopra proposed including Karun Nair as a specialist batter at No. 6, moving Jadeja to No. 7 and opting for a four-pronged pace attack — excluding Shardul.Chopra also stressed that the first Test will reveal Gill’s leadership philosophy. “It will be worth watching how this era proceeds in Shubman Gill's captaincy… The Headingley match will decide what our thought process will be,” he said, noting the temptation to play an extra batter due to India's slightly inexperienced batting lineup.",India face england in the first test of the five-match series starting june 20 at headingley.

Inter Miami and Al Ahly played to a goalless draw in the opening match of FIFA's new 32-team tournament, with Lionel Messi narrowly missing a stoppage-time winner in front of 60,927 fans at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens on Saturday.Messi's curling shot from 20 yards out in the final minutes was tipped onto the crossbar by Al Ahly goalkeeper Mohamed El Shenawy, denying Miami the victory.The Egyptian side had their own opportunity to take the lead when Trezeguet's first-half penalty was saved by Miami's Argentine goalkeeper Oscar Ustari.El Shenawy made another crucial save in the dying seconds, preventing a header from Maxi Falcon as Miami pressed for a win in the Group A encounter.The tournament opener proved successful for FIFA, with strong attendance at the 64,000-capacity venue and efficient security measures in place.Over 10,000 Al Ahly supporters created an energetic atmosphere, arriving early to support their team, which has won the African Champions League 12 times and the Egyptian league 45 times.The match saw plenty of action despite the lack of goals, with Al Ahly dominating the first half before Miami improved after the break.Al Ahly threatened early when Emam Ashour was denied by Ustari after being set up by Trezeguet.Palestine international Wessam Abou Ali had a goal disallowed for offside and later saw his powerful shot tipped over by Ustari.The penalty came after Telasco Segovia fouled Zizo, but Trezeguet's weak spot-kick was saved, and he couldn't convert the rebound.Miami showed more attacking intent in the second half, with Messi's 64th-minute free-kick grazing the post before hitting the side-netting.""The truth is we leave with the feeling that we could have won it in the second half. Going forward we have to do what we did in the second half, not have any fear, shed whatever baggage we had because when we play like that, we can play even with any team,"" said Miami's Argentina coach Javier Mascherano.""It's a game of mistakes. We had a decent amount of chances in the first half to put the game in a different space,"" said Al Ahly's Spanish coach Jose Riveiro, who took charge of the team specifically for this tournament.""It was like we were playing in Cairo and that was a surprise for me in my first official match with Al Ahly. To be here in the States and have it like you were playing at home is something that can probably only happen in this club,"" Riveiro added.Miami's upcoming matches include facing Porto in Atlanta on Thursday before returning home to play Brazil's Palmeiras on Monday.The stadium operations showed significant improvement from last year's Copa America final between Argentina and Colombia, which had experienced chaotic scenes with fans breaking into the ground due to entry delays.The tournament opening proceeded smoothly without any impact from the controversial immigration crackdown by US President Donald Trump's administration on the heavily Hispanic South Florida community.","Inter miami and al ahly played to a goalless draw in the opening match of fifa's new 32-team tournament.

'The Sun is on us': Temba Bavuma soaks it in





South Africa captain Temba Bavuma has called out Pat Cummins-led Australia for using the ""chokers"" tag in their second innings of the World Test Championship (WTC) final at Lord's.“While we were batting, we could hear the Aussies using that dreaded word: choke,” Bavuma told reporters after the match.“We came in with a lot of belief and a lot of doubters. We got ourselves into the final, and there were doubters as to the route we took. This win squashes that. Here’s an opportunity for us as a nation, divided as we are, to unite.”Bavuma said he hoped winning the mace for best Test nation would lift the profile of Test cricket in South Africa, where no Test matches are scheduled for the upcoming 2025–26 home season.""We want to play more Test cricket,"" he said. ""We want to play against the bigger nations. So I think this will go a long way in making us a lot more attractive — and also the so-called smaller nations.""Bavuma, the first Black African specialist batsman to play Test cricket for the Proteas, said his side had been inspired by South Africa's Springboks, who have won four Rugby World Cups — including the two most recent tournaments.""This is special for this group, special for myself, for the country,"" Bavuma told reporters.""I have watched the rugby guys, and the biggest thing I admire about them is the way, with their success, they have embraced what being South African actually means.""As South Africans, we are unique in a lot of ways. Our present and future are shaped by our past, and the way they (the Springboks) have gone about things has really captured the hearts of everyone. It's something we've spoken about — to try and do something special.""The captain said his players wanted to achieve the consistent success of earlier South African Test teams, in particular the sides that held the Test mace for three years between 2013 and 2015, as a result of topping the rankings before the introduction of a Test final.""We've said as a team we would like to judge ourselves after three or four years as a group,"" said Bavuma.

Lobo Predicted It, Again: South Africa’s Historic WTC Win vs Australia





NEW DELHI: South Africa defeated reigning champions Australia by five wickets in the World Test Championship final at Lord's on Saturday, successfully chasing down a target of 282 before lunch on the fourth day. Aiden Markram 's superb 136 and captain Temba Bavuma's 66 led South Africa to victory, while Australia's captain Pat Cummins acknowledged his team fell short despite being favoured to win against a South African side with fewer star players.Australia initially held a 74-run lead after the first innings, but couldn't maintain their advantage as South African fast bowler Kagiso Rabada delivered an impressive performance with match figures of 9-110.""Things can change pretty quickly. Unfortunately, it was a bridge too far,"" said Cummins at the post-match presentation ceremony.Steve Smith's first-innings score of 66 stood as the only half-century or better by an Australian specialist batsman in the match. Smith's participation in the upcoming first Test against the West Indies in Barbados on June 25 is now uncertain due to a dislocated finger sustained while dropping a slip catch.""We've got a couple of weeks before the first Test in the Windies, so we'll sit down and have a bit of a think,"" said Cummins.""To make these finals, it's normally off the back of being really strong at home, but you've got to win some away series too,"" he later added at a post-match press conference. ""So, in some ways, it's good we get to dust ourselves off and turn around in a couple of weeks and start looking ahead to the next one. That's one of the good things about the World Test Championship, every Test series and every Test match feels like you're playing for something significant. ""South Africa's successful run chase marked the second-highest at Lord's in Test history, behind only the West Indies' 344-1 against England in 1984.""They (South Africa) were fantastic in that fourth innings. There wasn't a lot in the wicket but they didn't give us a chance,"" said Cummins.The match concluded the third edition of the World Test Championship, following New Zealand's victory in 2021 and Australia's triumph in 2023, with India finishing as runners-up in both instances.The championship's format has faced criticism due to countries having the freedom to determine their Test match participation during the two-year qualifying cycle. South Africa played just 12 Tests in the recent cycle, without facing England or Australia, while Australia reached the final after winning 13 out of 19 matches.""They showed why they're in this final and are deserved champions,"" Cummins said of South Africa.Regarding the format, Cummins jokingly remarked, ""I preferred it at the Oval last time,"" before adding more seriously, ""It's something you build towards for two years, it's a huge achievement to make the final, and then a one-game shootout, I think it's a fantastic spectacle.""Australia may need to reassess their batting lineup as they begin a new World Test Championship cycle, particularly considering Marnus Labuschagne's struggles, who averaged only 25.63 in Tests during the 2024/25 season and scored just 17 and 22 at Lord's after being promoted to opener.",South africa defeated reigning champions australia by five wickets in the world test championship final at lord's on saturday.

Joe Burrow, one of the most popular and talented players in the league, has finally opened up about Trey Hendrickson’s situation with the Cincinnati Bengals. While Joe Burrow is known for always supporting his teammates, it seems like his take on Trey Hendrickson’s situation with the Cincinnati Bengals has raised some eyebrows among fans.Recently, Joe Burrow was spotted at the Cincinnati Bengals’ first day of minicamp but Trey Hendrickson remained missing from it.After the minicamp, Joe Burrow was asked about Trey Hendrickson’s situation and the star player said, ""Last year we had two (distractions) This year we have one. That's definitely less. You'd love to have none but, you know, that's life in the NFL. We're all supporting Trey, and would love for him to be back.""But Joe Burrow’s words have not gone down well with his fans. A fan wrote, “Mr. Excuses back at it again”, while another fan commented, “wow burrow can’t count to 2? or he just forget about that 1st round bust already?”A third fan wrote, “Kinda disappointed in Joe.. put the same emphasis on the front office to sign Trey as you did Tee and Jamarr. I expected more.. But that’s just me and this is business”.However, some fans have also supported Joe Burrow.A fan wrote, “I love Joe because he’s always trying to get his guys paid. This is the answer that gives Trey a bit more leverage.”Another fan wrote, “#Bengals front office, is putting Joe Burrow in such a tough spot, every year, for absolutely no reason… Trey deserves to be paid, he was there with the team, when others weren’t. He is a leader on that defense, as they continue to dismantle the D. Pay him 🙏🏽”While Trey Hendrickson’s contract dispute is yet to be solved, Joe Burrow’s personal life has also been in the news.A few weeks ago, at Coachella 2025, Joe Burrow was spotted getting out of a van that also had model Olivia Ponton sitting inside. While there were rumours of the two dating back in December 2024, their appearance at Coachella sparked such rumours again.However, both Joe Burrow and Olivia Ponton have remained tight lipped about their dating lives.Also Read: ""I come off as mean"": Travis Hunter's wife Leanna Lenee opens up about how NFL WAGs treated her amid brutal trolling",Joe burrow opens up on trey hendrickson’s situation in the cincinnati bengals.

He was eventually retired out to allow others a hit in the middle — a tactical call that didn’t diminish the impact of his knock.Sarfaraz’s latest hundred adds to his growing reputation in English conditions. He had earlier scored 92 against England Lions in an unofficial Test match, showcasing his talent ahead of India’s five-match Test series against England starting June 20.Earlier in the innings, India A lost Ruturaj Gaikwad for a two-ball duck to Mohammed Siraj , caught behind by Rishabh Pant. But Abhimanyu Easwaran (39) and Sai Sudharsan (38) — both part of the upcoming Test squad — provided some stability.Among the Indian bowlers, Siraj (2/86) and Prasidh Krishna (2/41) made notable contributions, while Nitish Kumar Reddy picked up one wicket. However, India's premier fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah failed to make an impact, conceding 36 runs in his seven overs without taking a wicket. Arshdeep Singh (0/52 in 12 overs) also went wicketless.India’s batting on Day 1 was anchored by half-centuries from captain Shubman Gill and KL Rahul , who looked fluent in the middle as the team builds towards the England Test challenge.","Sarfaraz khan scored a blazing century for india a against the main indian test squad on day 2 of the ongoing intra-squad warm-up game.

Temba Bavuma on picking Ngidi over Paterson for WTC Final: 'Tough decision'





South African fast bowler Kagiso Rabada has etched his name alongside West Indies legend Gordon Greenidge as the only two players in the 141-year history of Lord’s to appear on the iconic honours boards in both the home and away dressing rooms. Rabada ’s latest feat came during the World Test Championship (WTC) final against Australia at the historic ground. The 30-year-old delivered a masterclass, claiming 5 for 51 in the first innings and following it up with another four wickets in the second, helping South Africa stay competitive against a strong Australian side.In Test cricket, players who score a century or take a five-wicket haul at Lord’s earn the privilege of having their name inscribed in gold lettering on the famous honours boards - an accolade revered by cricketers worldwide.Before Rabada, this rare distinction belonged solely to Gordon Greenidge. The legendary opener’s scores of 214 not out and 103 for the West Indies against England in 1984 and 1988 are immortalised on the away honours board. Lesser known, however, is Greenidge’s appearance on the home board — a result of his 122 while playing for the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) against the Rest of the World in 1987.Rabada, too, was already on the away board for his five-wicket haul (5 for 52) against England in 2022.But this time, a unique twist added to the story. As South Africa were assigned the home dressing room for the WTC final, Rabada’s first-innings five-for earned him a place on the home board as well — making him only the second player in Lord’s history to achieve this honour.A piece of sticky batting tape with Rabada’s name written on it has been temporarily attached to the board for his figures of 5-51, as tradition dictates during the match. The gold lettering will follow soon, reported the BBC.Rabada’s achievement is even more poignant given his recent redemption arc, bouncing back strongly after serving a doping ban for using a recreational drug — an incident Australian captain Pat Cummins confirmed his side would not exploit as a sledging tactic. “That’s not our style. I doubt that will come up,” Cummins said before the final.Cricket greats have not held back in their praise. Former Australia skipper Ricky Ponting likened Rabada’s prowess at Lord’s to that of Glenn McGrath, who famously exploited the unique slope at the ground to devastating effect. “Glenn McGrath was exactly the same at Lord’s. He loved bowling there and mastered the slope from both ends — something not talked about as much as it should be,” Ponting told the ICC. “These big games are about big-name players standing up, and Rabada did exactly that. ”Reflecting on his name appearing in both dressing rooms, Rabada called the achievement “cool”, underlining the personal significance of joining such a niche club in cricket’s spiritual home.",Kagiso rabada is only the second player in lord's history to have his name inscribed on both the home and away honours boards. The 30-year-old claimed a total of 9 wickets during the world test championship (wtc) final against australia at the historic ground. West indies legend gordon greenidge is the only other player to have both honours.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121829108,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-79092,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

J.J. Spaun clinched his first major golf title at the US Open in Oakmont on Sunday, June 16, 2025, with a dramatic 65-foot birdie putt on the final hole. He overcame a challenging start, including five bogeys in the first six holes, to defeat Scotland's Robert MacIntyre by two strokes with a two-over 72.Spaun's victory was highlighted by four birdies in the last seven holes, including a tap-in birdie at the par-four 17th hole where he drove the green. He joined golf legends Jack Nicklaus, Ben Hogan, Tom Watson, and Jon Rahm in finishing with consecutive birdies to win the US Open.""Just to finish it off like that is just a dream. You watch other people do it... you see crazy moments. To have my own moment like that at this championship, I'll never forget this moment for the rest of my life,"" Spaun said.""It's definitely like a storybook, fairytale ending, kind of underdog fighting back, not giving up, never quitting. With the rain and everything and then the putt, you couldn't write a better story. I'm just so fortunate to be on the receiving end of that,"" he added.Prior to this victory, Spaun's only PGA Tour win was the 2022 Texas Open. He had been runner-up at both the Cognizant Classic and Players Championship this year, losing to second-ranked Rory McIlroy in a playoff at the latter event.""I just felt like you keep putting yourself in these positions, like eventually you're going to tick one off,"" Spaun reflected.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? A 96-minute weather delay proved crucial for Spaun after his difficult start. ""I just needed to reset everything, kind of like start the whole routine over. I felt like I had a really good chance to win the US Open at the start of the day. It just unravelled very fast. But that break was actually the key for me winning this tournament,"" he explained.The victory was particularly meaningful given Spaun's personal challenges. He was misdiagnosed with one type of diabetes in 2018, receiving ineffective treatment until 2021 when he was correctly diagnosed with a different type.The morning of his victory had started chaotically. ""My daughter had a stomach bug and was vomiting all night long. Kind of a rough start to the morning. I'm not blaming that on my start, but it kind of fit the mold of what was going on, the chaos,"" Spaun shared.""I was just in shock, disbelief that it went in and it was over. I couldn't even believe what I witnessed when that went in,"" Spaun said about his winning putt.Norway's Viktor Hovland, ranked 14th, finished third at 282 and witnessed Spaun's remarkable comeback. ""That was unbelievable. After his start, it just looked like he was out of it immediately. Everyone came back to the pack. And then the one on 18, it's just absolutely filthy there,"" Hovland commented.""As bad as things were going, I just still tried to just commit to every shot,"" Spaun said. ""I tried to just continue to dig deep. I've been doing it my whole life.""","J.j. spaun clinched his first major golf title at the us open in oakmont on sunday, june 16, 2025, with a dramatic 65-foot birdie putt on the final hole.
