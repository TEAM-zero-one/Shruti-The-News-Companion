The night before the Night of Champions sees a star-studded Kingdom arena in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. From WWE Women’s Champion Tiffany Stratton, to the woman she will face tonight, Nia Jax, to WWE Tag Team Champions Montez Ford and Angelo Dawkins and Women’s U.S. Champion Zelina Vega, Giulia, Jade Cargill, and Asuka, Riyadh is a myriad of wrestling superstars.The June 27th edition of WWE SmackDown is a preview to the big night, where the King and Queen of the Ring for 2025 will be decided. But not to fret, the night in itself has some pretty high profile matches to go through, and John Cena is also set to be featured alongside CM Punk, Cody Rhodes, Randy Orton, and LA KnightCody Rhodes makes his entrance after being introduced by ring announcer Mark Nash to the crowd cheering for him. He was about to speak when he got interrupted by entrance music. Randy Orton walked to the ring, and the crowd continued to sing his theme song even after it stopped playing. The segment then got cut short for international viewers because of a feed issue with Netflix. The streaming company posted a graphic apologizing for the interruption, and then a “we’ll be right back” graphic appeared.The Bloodline members or whatever is left of it, are still fighting against each other.And this time it was a match between JC Mateo and Jimmy Uso with an appearance from Solo Sikoa. Mateo looked to be the dominant one from the beginning, even though Jimmy Uso tried his best to overcome his opponent. At the end, Uso went up top and then jumped over and rolled, but Mateo was ready for him and defeated Uso by pinfall in about 6 minutes into the match.In an after match segment, Solo Sikoa, who tried to distract Jimmy Uso during the match, helped him up and asked him if he was ready to come back. In return, he got slapped by his cousin while fans booed. Jacob Fatu made an entrance to the crowd cheering for him, and dropped a Samoan Drop on Mateo after running into the ring, and then a double jump moonsault. Uso then pushed Fatu out of the way and superkicked Sikoa out of the ring, bringing an end to the segment.In a backstage segment, #DIY and other tag teams are seen talking about The Wyatt Sicks when SmackDown General Manager Nick Aldis comes in. Listening to their chatter, Aldis calls in Andrade and asks him to find a partner to face a now furious #DIYBoth Giulia and Zelina Vega looked to be equally matched as the fight started. When Giulia hit a double underhook superplex, Vega retaliated with a Code Red. The match seemed like it could be in anyone's favor, before Giulia kneed her opponent in the face before hitting Vega with a Northern Lights Bomb, defeating her in roughly 7:30 minutes to win the Women’s U.S. Championship by pinfall.In another backstage segment, Charlotte Flair and Alexa Bliss are seen exchanging a few words before the latter walks off. Could this be the beginning of an unlikely partnership?Then Aksuka and Jade Cargill make their way into the ring before tomorrow night, where they will face off against each other for the Queen of the Ring title. They exchange a few words before Money in the Bank winner Naomi cuts them off with her entrance. There is a strong chance she will cash in her MITB win during the Night of Champions event the next night.In yet another backstage segment, Aleister Black walks in on Raw General Manager Adam Pearce and SmackDown General Manager Nick Aldis discussing the WWE Women’s Tag Team Championship. But it all turns into chaos when R-Truth bursts in demanding to get a face-off against John Cena. Aldis tells him that John Cena is in Riyadh to fight CM Punk, but R-Truth says he is here for Cena before walks off. All this while, Black is there watching everything happen. At the end he walks off. Is another storyline brewing backstage?Andrade bringing in Rey Fenix was a surprise for many, and the crowd are seen cheering for what is to come. The two tag teams go up against each other one after the other. At one time Fenix is seen running to the top rope and kicking Tommaso Ciampa in the face, while in the next moment fans can see #DIY hitting Andrade with the Shatter Machine for a near fall. At the end Andrade and Rey Fenix defeated “DIY” Johnny Gargano and Tommaso Ciampa by pinfall in about 15 minutes into the match.After the earlier backstage segment, R-Truth gets in the ring to a deafening crowd response. He is in his vibe, and calls out John Cena. But suddenly, Aleister Black comes from behind and hits him with Black Mass and a cryptic message, before walking off. The audience is left bewildered.The Street Profits sees Angelo Dawkins and Montez Ford going against The Wyatt Sicks members, Joe Gacy and Dexter Lumis. To make things interesting, Erik Rowan, Nikki Cross, and Uncle Howdy also make their appearance, as things go awry minutes into the match. Los Garza, The Motor City Machine Guns, and Fraxiom are all seen coming to ringside, and even the recent losers #DIY are there. A brawl breaks out, leading to the match being thrown out.The Last Woman Standing Match seesNia Jax going against the current title holder, Tiffany Stratton. Before the bell can even ring, Nia Jax throws Tiffany Stratton into the ring post. Jax's physically imposing nature comes in handy against a lithe opponent like Stratton, but the latter manages to keep herself in the match over and over. Suddenly, Naomi runs into the ring with her Money in the Bank briefcase. But while she is talking to the referee, Stratton hits her before sending Jax on top of her. In the end, Stratton picked up the MITB briefcase and knocked Jax off before taking the win for herself with a pinfall after 17 minutes in the ring.The final segment of the night saw WWE Champion John Cena making his entrance with his title belt held high. He said, ""This is what a winner looks like,” and called CM Punk a loser. CM Punk then made his entry wearing a Chicago Cubs jersey, a chain with a padlock on it, a Chicago Bulls hat on backwards, and jorts, mocking Cena's usual attire.Punk also put on big rings resembling Cena, before saying, “Yo, check it, this is basic Punkanomics. Don’t adjust your television set, your eyes are just right. This clown plagiarized my pipe bomb, so now I’m stealing WordLife.” John Cena looked completely shocked at the tune of events as Punk continued rapping and rhyming. The Best in the World then dropped the mic and did the infamous “you can’t see me” hand gesture in Cena’s face, bringing an end to the show.PS.

Jets still hoping to make their case for long-term loyalty

As NHL free agency approaches, Winnipeg Jets winger Nikolaj Ehlers is quickly becoming one of the most sought-after names on the market. After 10 seasons in Manitoba, the Danish forward has reportedly told the Jets he intends to test free agency on July 1—news that has sparked interest from multiple franchises across the league.NHL trade rumors are swirling as Winnipeg Jets forward Nikolaj Ehlers prepares to hit free agency, drawing serious interest from contenders like the Hurricanes, Kings, and Sharks ahead of July 1.“Hearing Nikolaj Ehlers has informed the Jets he will go to free agency on July 1. Door not closed on Manitoba, but will test the market,” tweeted NHL insider Elliotte Friedman on Thursday.While the Winnipeg Jets are still hoping to retain the skilled winger, it’s clear other teams are preparing aggressive pitches. Among them, the Carolina Hurricanes—valued at $1.25 billion by Forbes—are reportedly “very serious” about signing Ehlers, according to Friedman, who spoke during Oilers Now with Bob Stauffer.“I think there are definitely some things in motion,” Friedman said. “I’ve heard Carolina is very serious about Ehlers, but I also think he could end up just about anywhere. That’s what’s going to make this a really interesting situation — there are a lot of teams poking around, and they all seem to have slightly different priorities.”Beyond Carolina, both the Los Angeles Kings and San Jose Sharks have emerged as potential suitors. The Kings are exploring multiple roster moves, while the Sharks, facing pressure to reach the salary cap floor, could view Ehlers as a strategic addition despite their ongoing rebuild.“Some teams are looking at shorter-term fits,” Friedman noted. “Then you’ve got teams like San Jose who need to hit the cap floor. So, Ehlers could have multiple types of suitors. ... I’ve also heard L.A. has a few irons in the fire.”Despite Ehlers' intention to explore options, Winnipeg GM Kevin Cheveldayoff hasn’t given up hope. He emphasized the team’s long-standing relationship with Ehlers, who was drafted by the Jets and has been a consistent top-six forward.“Nikolaj has been a player that has grown up in our organization,” Cheveldayoff said. “Drafted, developed him, we'll put our best foot forward with him to try to make our case to be a unique Jet-for-life-type player.”Also Read: NHL CBA overhaul: Auston Matthews sparks dress code rebellion as league expands to 84-game season With 63 points in 69 games last season, Ehlers’ mix of speed, offensive production, and two-way play makes him one of the most versatile forwards available this summer—guaranteeing a competitive bidding war once the free agent window opens.","Winnipeg jets winger nikolaj ehlers is set to test free agency on july 1.

NEW DELHI: Teen prodigy Vaibhav Suryavanshi made a dazzling first impression on English soil with a stunning 19-ball 48 in the first Youth ODI between India U19 and England U19 at the County Ground in Hove on Friday.The 14-year-old opener announced himself with a fearless display of strokeplay, smashing five sixes and three fours to set the tone for India's successful run chase.Chasing 175, Suryavanshi partnered with captain Ayush Mhatre to give India U19 a lightning start, adding 71 runs in just 7.3 overs. His blistering innings ended two short of a deserving half-century when he was caught by Tazeem Chaudry Ali off Ralphie Albert in the eighth over. Mhatre followed soon after, dismissed for 21 off 30 balls.The total, however, was not threatening for the team as India U19 registered a commanding six-wicket victory with 156 balls to spare. Wicketkeeper-batter Abhigyan Kundu, 45 not out off 34 balls, hit the winning six in the 24th over.Earlier in the day, England U19 chose to bat first but were bowled out for 174 in 42.2 overs. Rocky Flintoff, son of former England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff , top-scored for the hosts with a composed 56 off 90 balls, laced with three sixes and as many boundaries.India's bowlers dominated proceedings, with Kanishk Chouhan leading the charge with figures of 3 for 20 in his full quota of 10 overs. Mohamed Enaan (2/37), RS Ambrish (2/24), and Henil Patel (2/41) chipped in with two wickets apiece to dismantle the England batting order.Speaking ahead of the tour, Suryavanshi had told iplt20.com, “I will get a good experience of playing in England.

Kyrie Irving fires up after Paige Bueckers hits buzzer-beater three for Wings against Clark-less Fever,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/kyrie-irving-fires-up-after-paige-bueckers-hits-buzzer-beater-three-for-wings-against-clark-less-fever/articleshow/122123166.cms,"(Image Source - Getty Images)

Paige Bueckers hit a wild logo three at the buzzer and the crowd lost it

Paige Bueckers lit up the first half with a logo-range dagger that had fans on their feet and Kyrie Irving jumping out of his seat. It wasn’t just a buzzer-beater, it was a statement. As the Fever struggled without Caitlin Clark, Bueckers grabbed her moment, bringing energy, belief, and a little NBA magic to the floor. Her 12th point of the half might just be her most unforgettable.The vibe was electric at the American Airlines Center on June 27, 2025. During a close contest, Dallas Wings rookie Paige Bueckers pulled off a daring logo shot to finish the first half—her 12th point of the half—doing it in true Caitlin Clark style, even with Clark out due to a groin injury. The crowd erupted, and as the referee's whistles still echoed, Bueckers sprinted to the sideline. Right there, Kyrie Irving—Bueckers’s self-proclaimed favorite NBA star—jumped up and gave her a quick dap, sealing the moment and merging WNBA talent with NBA stardom.At the end of the half, Indiana was still in the lead by 13, but the momentum had noticeably changed. The Fever, who were missing their superstar Caitlin Clark averaging 18.2 points, 8.9 assists, and 5.6 rebounds, but going through a rough patch with a 1-for-23 shooting slump from three-point range on the road, were feeling the pressure.Bueckers’s signature shot not only reduced the lead but also energized the Wings and their star-studded audience.Bueckers has always talked about her dream of having a big-game moment with Irving—ever since she got to Dallas on Media Day, where she referred to him as her favorite player ""forever"". Now that dream has become a reality, proving her journey from an ACL comeback in college to thriving as a WNBA rookie in the same city as the nine-time NBA All-Star.Their shared background goes further: both dealt with ACL injuries (Irving’s in March 2025, Bueckers’s in 2022) and bounced back stronger, creating a natural connection. When Irving was courtside on Thursday, the combination of chants, whistles, and Bueckers’s shot resulted in one of the standout rookie moments of the young WNBA season.Even with her amazing performances, Bueckers’s team started this season at the bottom of the standings with a record of 4–12. Still, her personal stats—17.7 points, 5.8 assists, and 4.6 rebounds per game—are similar to Clark’s impressive numbers. She’s gaining national recognition, not only for her skills on the court but also for advocating for her fellow players—publicly supporting Caitlin Clark and challenging the “inhumane” pressure put on young talents.Also Read: LeBron James celebrates his electric boat team’s strong finish in Italy but the real test is still ahead As the Wings strive to narrow the distance, Bueckers keeps evolving amidst both attention and challenges.

Steelers embrace Aaron Rodgers , but NFL legends push back on his greatness

Skip Bayless and Terry Bradshaw pile on Aaron Rodgers’ reputation



Aaron Rodgers is heading into his final NFL season, now wearing a Pittsburgh Steelers jersey, but the four-time MVP’s swan song is already facing scrutiny. At 41, the future Hall of Famer has made it clear this will be his last ride, but instead of a universal send-off, his legacy is under fire—especially from legends and analysts who aren’t sold on his leadership credentials.The Steelers have rolled out the red carpet for Aaron Rodgers. Head coach Mike Tomlin praised the veteran quarterback, saying, “I mean, read his resume. We're excited about him being here.” Tight end Pat Freiermuth also drew comparisons between Rodgers and Pittsburgh icon Ben Roethlisberger, adding, “I think he's similar to Ben in a way, where you know he sees the game in a certain way.”However, not all football voices are as supportive. Hall of Famer Cris Carter took a public shot at Rodgers on the Fully Loaded podcast, questioning his football intelligence and influence in team meetings compared to other greats. “People don't feel that same way about Aaron Rodgers because his knowledge of the game is not the same as these guys,” Carter said, referring to Peyton Manning and Tom Brady. “He sounds like a spoiled child. ”Carter argued that Rodgers lacks the elite mental grasp of the game that defined Brady’s and Manning’s success.He claimed Rodgers didn’t command the same respect in the Jets’ locker room, saying, “They would have been like, ‘Guess what we're getting ready to do? What that guy right there said.’ Manning conducted meetings in Denver. Brady did the same in Tampa Bay.”Rodgers’ image as a ""diva"" resurfaced once again when Skip Bayless blasted the Steelers for signing him. Even more brutally, Steelers legend Terry Bradshaw said Rodgers was a bad fit for the franchise and took a swipe at his off-field persona: “That guy needs to stay in California, go somewhere and chew on bark and whisper to the gods out there.”Despite the noise, Rodgers remains focused. “I mean, I played 20 freaking years, you know? It’s been a long run and I’ve enjoyed it,” he told The Pat McAfee Show. “What better place to finish than in one of the cornerstone franchises of the NFL?”Also Read: Patrick Mahomes reignites Kansas City’s Super Bowl fire as Chiefs chase NFL immortality in 2025 As Rodgers looks to cement his legacy with one last Super Bowl run, the criticism he faces may either break the myth—or prove once and for all that greatness just wears differently on him.",Aaron rodgers' final nfl season with the steelers is generating mixed reactions.

Trey Hendrickson still waiting as Bengals’ contract offer fails to match market value

Bengals Star Trey Hendrickson SOUNDS OFF on Contract Status, Future in Cincinnati

Bengals defense needs Trey Hendrickson now more than ever



Trey Hendrickson has officially turned down a $28 million-per-year offer from the Cincinnati Bengals, intensifying his contract holdout and casting serious doubt over his future with the team. Despite leading the NFL in sacks last season, the star EDGE rusher remains unsigned long-term, fueling speculation that one of Cincinnati’s most dominant defenders could be on his way out in 2025.Trey Hendrickson isn’t just another pass rusher, he’s the most productive EDGE defender in the NFL over the last two seasons. After posting a league-leading 17 sacks in 2024 and a staggering total of 35 since 2023, Hendrickson has become the anchor of a Bengals defense that desperately needs his presence.Yet, despite his performance, the Bengals have reportedly offered just $28 million annually—a figure well below market value for a player of Hendrickson’s caliber. While the deal would place him eighth among NFL EDGE defenders in annual salary, it still falls short of what most believe he’s worth in today’s rising salary cap environment.According to NFL Network’s Tom Pelissero, Hendrickson isn’t demanding to surpass Myles Garrett’s record-setting $40 million AAV.Instead, he’s seeking multi-year security that reflects his elite status and long-term impact in Cincinnati.“He would like to get a multi-year deal that gives him security and keeps him in Cincinnati,” Pelissero stated on The Rich Eisen Show. “Bengals just have not stepped up with significant enough of an offer for him to take it.”The Bengals’ hesitation to lock in Trey Hendrickson is raising concerns—especially after their defense struggled during the 2024 season. With Joe Burrow returning healthy, Cincinnati is back in win-now mode. Losing their top defensive player could seriously hurt those chances.Also Read: Michael Penix Jr. takes over as Falcons’ starting QB; $27.5M Kirk Cousins moved to backup role To make matters worse, stars like T.J. Watt are also due for new deals, and market prices are rising. If the Bengals wait too long, they risk overpaying later or losing Hendrickson entirely. And if that happens, the Bengals may find out just how hard it is to replace a true game-changer off the edge.","Trey hendrickson has officially turned down a $28 million-per-year offer from the cincinnati bengals.

Falcons emerge as must-watch team in 2025 amid bold QB decision and trade rumors



“The Falcons are gambling that sophomore first-round pick Michael Penix Jr. can do more with a stacked group of offensive weapons than Kirk Cousins could in 2024.”

The Atlanta Falcons have named Michael Penix Jr. as their starting quarterback for the 2025 NFL season, moving veteran Kirk Cousins to a backup role. Cousins, who is set to earn $27.5 million, now faces trade speculation. With Penix taking over, the Falcons are entering a new era and one of the NFL’s biggest storylines is unfolding in Atlanta.The Atlanta Falcons are making headlines after officially naming Michael Penix Jr. as their starting quarterback for the 2025 NFL season. In a surprising move, veteran Kirk Cousins, who signed a $180 million deal just last year, has been moved to a backup role.Penix, the No. 8 overall pick in the 2024 NFL Draft, showed flashes of potential in three starts last season. Despite a 1-2 record, his big-play ability and aggressive downfield throws gave Atlanta fans a glimpse of what the future might hold. Now, that future is here.The decision signals a major shift for the franchise. Cousins was brought in to stabilize the offense and help the Falcons return to playoff relevance. But after an underwhelming season and mounting pressure from fans and media alike, the coaching staff is going all-in on youth and upside.Bleacher Report’s Brad Gagnon ranked the Falcons among the top teams to watch in 2025, pointing to their high-risk quarterback change as a key storyline.With the NFC South wide open, the timing couldn’t be more crucial. Atlanta has also upgraded its defense by drafting top prospects Jalon Walker and James Pearce Jr., adding fuel to a playoff push.Penix brings potential, but questions remain about his consistency, accuracy, and ability to handle pressure. Meanwhile, Cousins' future is uncertain, with trade rumors already circulating.Also Read: NFL Trade Rumors: Steelers eye $275M QB Trevor Lawrence as Aaron Rodgers’ successor ahead of 2026 offseason NFL insider Brent Sobleski even suggested that a potential deal involving Cousins and the New Orleans Saints could still happen especially with Penix now firmly in control.","The atlanta falcons have named michael penix jr. as their starting quarterback for the 2025 nfl season.

Miami passed on Jonathan Taylor , and the regret hasn’t faded

The Miami Dolphins had three first-round picks in the 2020 NFL Draft. While Tua Tagovailoa and Austin Jackson remain starters, the pick that continues to draw criticism is Noah Igbinoghene. Miami passed on running back Jonathan Taylor, who has since become one of the league’s top rushers. That decision still sparks fan frustration and media backlash.With the No. 30 overall pick in the 2020 NFL Draft, the Miami Dolphins selected cornerback Noah Igbinoghene. At the time, the move raised questions, especially since running back Jonathan Taylor was still available.In three seasons with Miami, Igbinoghene started just five games before being traded to the Dallas Cowboys. Meanwhile, Taylor was selected at No. 41 overall by the Indianapolis Colts. Since then, he’s rushed for over 6,000 yards, ranking second in the NFL behind only Derrick Henry during that span.Taylor has already earned Pro Bowl honors and was named First-Team All-Pro in 2021. His impact has been consistent, and he’s become one of the league’s most reliable running backs. Igbinoghene, on the other hand, never made a lasting impact in Miami’s secondary.Bleacher Report’s Matt Holder recently called Igbinoghene the worst Dolphins draft pick of the last five years, not just because of his limited production, but because of who the team passed up. Putting Taylor into head coach Mike McDaniel’s offensive system could have changed everything.In 2023, the Dolphins had two running backs rush for over 800 yards. Adding Jonathan Taylor to that mix alongside Tua Tagovailoa, Tyreek Hill, and Jaylen Waddle might have made Miami’s offense one of the most dangerous in the league.Fans continue to look back at that 2020 draft with frustration. While Tagovailoa and Jackson have held up, the Igbinoghene pick is a clear miss.

Wayne Gretzky's early days in the WHA and that contract, which changed everything

Wayne Gretzky 🏒: The NHL Legend Who Was Never Actually Drafted! 🚀 #shorts #waynegretzky #nhl #hockey

Memories: Wayne Gretzky tallies his final NHL point

It might be an astonishing fact to learn that the greatest player in hockey history, Wayne Gretzky, was never drafted into the NHL . Current stars like Connor McDavid and Sidney Crosby had the honor of going first overall, but Wayne entered the league in an unusual backdoor way. This was not a case of some bizarre scouting miss; it was a perfect storm comprising age restriction, rival league, and one extraordinary contract in the making of hockey legends.Wayne Gretzky's path to the NHL began outside the NHL. At barely 17 years of age, he joined the World Hockey Association (WHA), a rival to the NHL, which allowed younger players to turn professional. He signed in 1978 with the Indianapolis Racers, but his stay there was short. After just eight games, the financially shaky team sold his contract to the Edmonton Oilers, another WHA franchise.Even so, Gretzky wasn’t an ordinary player. He had entered into a personal services contract, not a standard player contract. This meant that he was bound directly to the Oilers owner, Peter Pocklington, circumventing normal player rules. When the WHA merged with the NHL in 1979, the league found itself at a crossroads: would Gretzky be entered into the draft, or would he be allowed to play under his existing contract?In its endless whim against the league recession, the Colorado Rockies would supposedly snatch up my pick if I were drafted and moved.Hence, Gretzky insisted that he would remain in Edmonton. Following protracted deliberations, the NHL finally agreed to a compromise: the Oilers could keep Gretzky, but their draft order would be moved to the bottom for 1979. Thus, in 1979, they held the 21st overall pick and opted for Kevin Lowe, yet another future Hall of Famer.The introduction of Gretzky into the NHL marked the beginning of the epic dynasty in Edmonton. Over nine seasons, Gretzky led the Oilers to four Stanley Cups and set scoring records that no one has dared to touch till today, 2,857 career points, including 894 goals and 1,963 assists. While Alex Ovechkin did put an end to the goal record in 2025, no one has matched his total supremacy since.Also Read: From Canada’s hero to Donald Trump’s ally? Wayne Gretzky’s silence still feels like a betrayal to his home country Wayne Gretzky’s undrafted road to NHL greatness is a rare story told on the stage of timing, talent, and smart maneuvering. While today's prospects follow rigid draft rules, Gretzky proved that greatness does not always need permission to begin. His legacy remains one of the most remarkable and unrepeatable in all of sports history.","Wayne gretzky was never drafted into the nhl.

Toronto Maple Leafs hold on to John Tavares with a leadership contract renovation

The deepest thoughts of John Tavares for his tenure with the Toronto Maple Leafs were put down as the signing of a four-year contract extension that betrayed his heart for the franchise. Emerging from free agency, Tavares made the choice to stay with his alma mater, for whom he had led for many years. The attempt of the Leafs to create a nucleus of veteran leadership and consequently stay at the top of the Eastern Conference comes at a very critical moment for the player and team. Tavares's decision to make such a decision spoke of something that transcended money with Toronto.Making a wise decision in the trade market, the Maple Leafs decided to lock up veteran John Tavares with a new four-year deal that now has him with the franchise through 2028–29. The $18 million extension reduces his annual cap hit to $4.38 million because of a deferred component to his salary, which will not be allowed anymore once the new league rules take effect from the 2026–27 season onward. For the first two years, Tavares enjoys full no-movement rights before it reverts to a five-team limited trade clause.Even in his mid-30s, Tavares is still performing at an elite level. He managed to set 74 points last season, with 38 goals in 75 regular-season games.He also managed to score five goals through 13 playoff games before Florida dashed Toronto’s hopes in the second round. He could have taken a shorter, perhaps more lucrative contract elsewhere, but Tavares remained loyal to Toronto. He would rather look at stability and continuing than starting fresh elsewhere.Ever since his debut in the NHL in 2009, with the New York Islanders selecting him first overall, Tavares has evolved into one of the most reliable offensive players in the league. His career stats depict his longevity and consistency: 1,114 points in 1,184 games. The memorable first season in Toronto saw him score 47 goals, while his best 2014-15 season with the Islanders cemented his status as an elite scorer.Tavares' resume also features international glory. A native of Mississauga, Ontario, he has represented Canada in numerous major tournaments. Most prominently, he won gold at the 2014 Winter Olympics and was an integral part of the 2016 World Cup of Hockey-winning team. With these triumphs behind him, the added leadership presence from the Maple Leafs' locker room will undoubtedly be a great value as they continue to chase the championship.Also Read: John Tavares' uncertain future with Maple Leafs as free agency looms and changes mount John Tavares' decision to stay with the Toronto Maple Leafs further underlines his position as a cornerstone of the franchise. As the team continues to strive for playoff success, Tavares' leadership and scoring depth remain critical.

With Aaron Rodgers likely headed into retirement after the 2025 NFL season, the Pittsburgh Steelers are reportedly keeping tabs on a potential blockbuster replacement—$275 million quarterback Trevor Lawrence.

The eight-year deal of Trent Frederic solidifies the Oilers' trust in their long-term depth strategy

The Oilers, by almost entering into an eight-year contract extension with forward Trent Frederic, are making a sizable commitment. Brought in during the trade deadline through a complicated three-way deal, Frederic's value to the Oilers stretches far outside of regular-season statistics. He came into the team injured and had some regular-season time prior to the playoffs, and since his presence had become steady in their postseason run, this move declared Edmonton's long-term commitment to those role players who bring grit, depth, and consistency to the team as opposed to relying solely on star power.The Edmonton Oilers rushed to finalize an eight-year extension for Trent Frederic for an average annual value of just under $4 million. While not a big scorer with the puck, he is positioned more as a road-weary physical forward, which fits Edmonton's vision of creating a well-balanced team for the postseason.Frederic came over to Edmonton from Boston at the 2024-25 trade deadline in a complicated three-team trade where the New Jersey Devils retained 50% of his salary. The Oilers sent out a 2025 second-rounder, a 2026 fourth-rounder, defenseman Max Wanner, and forward Shane LaChance (who went to New Jersey).It was a savvy move to add some depth to the roster without crippling themselves on the salary side.Frederic got injured in the ankle when he arrived, playing just one regular-season game. However, he returned in the playoffs in time to play in all 22 postseason games. His stats-one goal, three assists-were not very flashy, but he brought a gritty presence and defensive responsibility that sometimes cannot be measured on the scoreboard.Now 26 years old, Frederic is in his prime. Locking him in for long-term development shows the Oilers' faith in his refinement. A short-term deal costing just below $4 million for a reliable, hard-nosed winger who has playoff experience is a very calculated risk for not only team depth but also chemistry and consistency.In today's NHL, guys like Frederic, who are cheap and consistent, can be the difference-makers in deep playoff runs. Edmonton feels he is one of those guys.Also Read: Lauren Kyle helped with developing the special connection between Leon Draisaitl and Connor McDavid on the ice The newest contract extension for Trent Frederic is more than simply a signing-it symbolizes the Oilers' outlook on a larger scale.

Injuries, playoff struggles, and criticism marked his year, leading to the Oilers moving him for a 2025 fourth-round pick. For Kane, it’s a fresh start in his hometown and a chance to focus on hockey, family, and redemption.The Edmonton Oilers’ 2024-25 Stanley Cup run was overshadowed by Evander Kane’s inconsistent presence and performance. Injuries and surgeries kept the 33-year-old winger off the ice for much of the regular season, and his playoff return sparked criticism after several costly penalties during the Finals. Sportsnet’s Mark Spector even labeled him “a liability” in Edmonton’s series loss to the Florida Panthers.Shortly after the Oilers’ second straight defeat in the Stanley Cup Final, the team traded Kane to the Vancouver Canucks in exchange for a fourth-round pick in the 2025 NHL Draft. While the trade might look like a salary dump for Edmonton, Kane says the real motivation behind the move came from a personal place—his children.“Anybody who has kids understands that they automatically jump up to be the No. 1 priority in your life,” Kane told Sportsnet.“I have four of them… they’re all very young, and they’re all very excited to cheer dad on.” His move to Vancouver not only brings him closer to his family but also marks a return to his hometown roots.Born in Vancouver, Kane grew up watching the Canucks and previously played junior hockey for the Vancouver Giants, winning the Memorial Cup in 2007. Now, after suiting up for five different NHL teams and recording 617 points (326 goals, 291 assists) across 930 regular-season games, he returns to the city where it all began.“The fan base here is fantastic. They’re passionate, they love their hockey… I know what hockey means in this city,” Kane said. “I’m really privileged and honored to be part of that.” With the Canucks, he hopes to silence his critics and reset his narrative as both a player and a father.Also Read: Inside Matthew Schaefer’s journey: How top NHL prospect endured unimaginable loss of his mother and more As for Kane, the opportunity to start over in a familiar city, supported by his family, could be just what he needs to find his form again.","Evander kane has been traded to the vancouver canucks after a disappointing 2024-25 season with the edmonton oilers.
