Who is Kathy Leutner and what does she do for a living?

A relationship rooted in privacy and shared passions

Sidney Crosby may be one of the NHL‚Äôs most celebrated players, but when it comes to his personal life, the Pittsburgh Penguins captain has always preferred to keep things private. For more than 15 years, Crosby has shared his life with Kathy Leutner, a model who has built her own impressive career away from the rink. Their relationship, while mostly out of the public eye, has captured the curiosity of fans who rarely get a glimpse into Crosby‚Äôs off-ice world.Kathy Leutner began her modeling career in 2005, but it was her 2011 appearance in Sports Illustrated that gave her the major breakthrough. Since then, she has worked with several fashion and lifestyle brands, including Abercrombie & Fitch, Hollister, Faviana, and Famous. Originally from Chantilly, Virginia, Leutner now resides in Halifax, Nova Scotia, alongside Crosby.What makes her stand out is her decision to live away from the spotlight. Unlike many partners of professional athletes, Leutner avoids social media, which has only added to the intrigue around their relationship.Still, she is often spotted supporting Crosby at games, a consistent presence throughout his career.The couple first met in 2008 through a mutual friend, when Sidney Crosby was just 21 years old and quickly rising as one of hockey‚Äôs brightest stars.

Did a rough outing against Puka Nacua prompt Xavien Howard to suddenly retire from the NFL?



Colts face new defensive challenges without Howard



Xavien Howard, the four-time Pro Bowler, has stunned the NFL by retiring mid-season after just four games with the Indianapolis Colts. The 32-year-old cornerback, who joined the Colts in August after sitting out the 2024 season, announced his decision following a challenging performance against the Los Angeles Rams, where star receiver Puka Nacua dominated. Howard was officially placed on the Colts‚Äô reserve/retired list on Wednesday.In an emotional Instagram post, Howard explained his choice to step away from the game. ‚ÄúWhen I was away from the game in 2024, I fell in love with taking my kids to school, doing activities with them and watching them grow up,‚Äù he wrote. ‚ÄúUp to that point I had always put my family after football. I‚Äôm no longer willing to do so. So today I am retiring from the National Football League. My purpose has been fulfilled in this sport, but my kids are more important to me than football. I‚Äôve had a hell of a career, and even though it‚Äôs ending in a unique way, I‚Äôm cool with that because for once I am putting my family first and I‚Äôm proud about that decision.‚ÄùHoward‚Äôs retirement underscores a growing trend of players prioritizing family over the game. After nine NFL seasons, including eight with the Miami Dolphins, Howard leaves behind a decorated career highlighted by four Pro Bowls, a first-team All-Pro selection in 2020, and two seasons leading the league in interceptions.Howard‚Äôs final games with the Colts included four starts, 11 tackles, and one fumble recovery. However, he struggled in coverage, particularly against Nacua, allowing 112 yards and a touchdown on seven completions from 10 targets. Pro Football Focus ranked him 156th out of 164 corners this season, and his 36.1 PFF grade was among the lowest in the league.Indianapolis, now 3‚Äì1, will face the Raiders at Lucas Oil Stadium this Sunday without Howard in the secondary. Despite the abrupt exit, Howard leaves a legacy as one of the NFL‚Äôs top cornerbacks of his era, reminding fans that even elite athletes sometimes choose life off the field over career records.Also Read: ""That's insane"": Tom Brady praises IShowSpeed‚Äôs unexpected sports skills, jokes streamer could trash-talk his way into NFL","Xavien howard retires from the nfl after just four games with the indianapolis colts.

Possible Trade Snapshot

Warriors Receive Heat Receive Andrew Wiggins



Jonathan Kuminga





Themay have securedon a fresh two-year, $48.5 million deal this offseason, but that doesn‚Äôt guarantee the young forward‚Äôs long-term future in San Francisco. In fact, multiple reports suggest the 6-foot-7 forward could be moved to the Miami Heat before the 2025-26 NBA trade deadline.Bleacher Report‚Äôs Andy Bailey has outlined a potential midseason trade scenario where Jonathan Kuminga heads to Miami in exchange for former Warrior Andrew Wiggins.‚ÄúWould the Warriors be interested in an Andrew Wiggins reunion,‚Äù Bailey wrote. ‚ÄúThey parted ways with one of the most important players from their 2022 title run to land Jimmy Butler, but the situation with Miami has evolved to the point that it should be interested in stockpiling younger talent.‚Äù (H/t Sporting News)Bailey further explained that Miami‚Äôs current build around Tyler Herro and Bam Adebayo lacks the ceiling of a true contender without Butler. Focusing on younger players like Jaime Jaquez Jr., Nikola Joviƒá, Kel‚Äôel Ware, Kasparas Jakuƒçionis, and potentially Kuminga would be a step toward long-term stability.For the Golden State Warriors , reuniting with Wiggins offers familiarity and flexibility. His ability to play within Golden State‚Äôs read-and-react system gives him an immediate advantage.Key potential roles for Wiggins if the trade goes through:‚Ä¢ Sixth man behind the starting core, similar to DeMar DeRozan‚Äôs role suggestion‚Ä¢ Option to play as a jumbo 2-guard alongside Stephen Curry, Jimmy Butler, Draymond Green, and Al Horford‚Ä¢ Reliable 3-and-D presence to space the floor and defend multiple positionsWiggins‚Äô consistency from beyond the arc and defensive versatility could prove more valuable for Golden State than investing further in Kuminga‚Äôs development.This isn‚Äôt the first time Jonathan Kuminga and the Heat have been connected. As far back as December 2024, reports tied him to Miami when Golden State‚Äôs season began to unravel. Speculation grew that a swap involving Jimmy Butler and Kuminga would reshape both franchises.However, on February 5, the Golden State Warriors instead packaged Andrew Wiggins in a blockbuster deal to land Butler. That decision shifted the narrative but also left unresolved tension between Kuminga and the organization.If Golden State revisits trade talks midseason, sending Kuminga to Miami in exchange for Wiggins could check multiple boxes:‚Ä¢ Short-term: Keep the roster competitive with veterans who fit seamlessly‚Ä¢ Long-term: Avoid committing major money to Kuminga while stabilizing the rotationKuminga‚Äôs future with the Golden State Warriors appears uncertain despite his lucrative new contract. With the team prioritizing stability around Stephen Curry and Jimmy Butler, reuniting with Wiggins may offer Golden State the balance it needs for another playoff push.

Connor McDavid‚Äôs goal: The best team around him with a genuine chance to win

Level of concern with McDavid potentially leaving?

Connor McDavid‚Äôs dilemma is to win now or cap later

Connor McDavid‚Äôs future with the Edmonton Oilers has once again taken center stage in NHL contract discussions. After Minnesota Wild forward Kirill Kaprizov secured an eight-year, $136 million extension this week, the attention immediately shifted to what Edmonton‚Äôs superstar captain might demand when his next deal comes up. The Oilers are already weighed down by big-money contracts that could limit how far they can go for McDavid.While McDavid is expected to set the market whenever he signs, Edmonton‚Äôs financial structure complicates the picture. The Oilers are currently locked into expensive long-term commitments. Leon Draisaitl‚Äôs $14 million salary, Evan Bouchard‚Äôs double-digit deal, and Darnell Nurse‚Äôs $9.25 million contract already consume a large portion of the cap. On top of that, goaltender Stuart Skinner is due for a significant raise in the near future.NHL insider Frank Seravalli highlighted this challenge, stating, ""They can't, I don't think the Edmonton Oilers can afford to go more. In fact, I don't think on their cap that they can really even afford to go 17 million, um, because of all the other deals that they've got."" That kind of financial squeeze makes it difficult for the Oilers to entertain numbers north of $17 million annually ‚Äî a figure that insiders believe McDavid could command.Even with the NHL‚Äôs salary cap set to climb in the coming seasons, Edmonton‚Äôs roster construction leaves little margin to maneuver.Oilers GM Stan Bowman addressed Connor McDavid‚Äôs contract situation on Wednesday, admitting there is still no clarity on whether the superstar captain will have a new deal before the regular season begins. Bowman revealed via TSN that ongoing talks with McDavid‚Äôs agent Judd Moldaver remain frequent but offered no firm timeline, stressing, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt like to make predictions, we‚Äôll see where it goes.‚ÄùBeyond the financial puzzle, McDavid‚Äôs decision may come down to competitiveness. The Oilers have enjoyed success over the past two years, but McDavid understands that aging players, a thin prospect pipeline, and limited draft picks can quickly derail momentum.For McDavid, the question is not simply ‚Äúhow much‚Äù but ‚Äúhow far can this team go?‚Äù He has made it clear throughout his career that chasing a Stanley Cup defines his priorities. That means Edmonton must strike a balance ‚Äî paying its franchise player while still building the depth required to compete against the league‚Äôs best.Kaprizov‚Äôs blockbuster contract raised expectations league-wide, but McDavid‚Äôs case is different. He may ultimately accept less than his maximum value if it ensures the Oilers remain contenders. At the same time, Edmonton must find creative ways to manage the salary cap or risk losing the most dominant player in the game.McDavid‚Äôs decision will shape not just the Oilers‚Äô future, but also the landscape of the NHL. His contract situation is now one of the defining storylines of the league.Also Read: Leon Draisaitl‚Äôs wife Celeste Desjardins just can‚Äôt stop reliving her dream wedding; Labels it ‚ÄúHappiest day of our lives‚Äù","Connor mcdavid's contract future with the edmonton oilers is under intense scrutiny following kirill kaprizov's massive deal.

Stacey Dales shares her personal WNBA experience



Collier‚Äôs critique highlights player frustrations



Stacey Dales, senior NFL Network reporter and former WNBA All-Star, has publicly voiced her frustration with WNBA leadership following Lynx star Napheesa Collier‚Äôs candid critique of commissioner Cathy Engelbert. Dales revealed a personal experience of feeling overlooked by the league, shedding light on long-standing concerns among former players. Her reflections come at a moment when scrutiny over Engelbert‚Äôs leadership is intensifying.Dales, who was the third overall pick in the 2002 WNBA Draft by the Washington Mystics, recalled her efforts to support the league after retirement in 2008. ‚ÄúI hosted a prominent WNBA event a couple of years ago. ‚ÄòWelcome to the league, Toronto,‚Äô‚Äù Dales wrote on X. ‚ÄúThe Toronto team intro ‚Äî it was exceptional. The TO people were amazing. I did it for free. I never once heard from Cathy or the WNBA or league in general. Nothing. Not a single bump on their social media. Frankly, it seemed like she didn‚Äôt know I played for the league at all. I walked away wondering if she even knew me. I have never heard from the league since I left the game.‚ÄùShe contrasted her WNBA experience with her time in the NFL, noting, ‚ÄúThe NFL treats me so kindly. Not like this.‚Äù After retiring from professional basketball, Dales transitioned into broadcasting, joining NFL Network in 2009, where she hosts shows including NFL Now and NFL Total Access. Her career also includes seven years as a reporter and analyst for ESPN and ABC, covering multiple sports at the highest level.Dales‚Äô comments came shortly after Napheesa Collier criticized Engelbert at her exit press conference, calling her leadership ‚Äúnegligent.‚Äù Collier revealed that conversations she had with Engelbert about league officiating in February were dismissed, with Engelbert reportedly responding, ‚ÄúWell only the losers complain about the refs.‚Äù Collier‚Äôs statement concluded with a sharp observation: ‚ÄúWe have the best players in the world. We have the best fans in the world. But right now, we have the worst leadership in the world.‚ÄùDales praised Collier‚Äôs remarks, calling them ‚Äúincredibly profound, powerful, and detailed statement from one of the league‚Äôs premier athletes and class all the way.‚Äù Her own story reinforces a broader pattern of former players feeling disconnected from the WNBA, raising questions about how the league engages with its talent and honors their contributions.Also Read: What led former Dolphins star Xavien Howard to retire after only four games with the Colts?",Nfl reporter and ex-wnba star stacey dales calls out commissioner cathy engelbert.

Justin Fields demands full accountability and discipline from players and coaches to turn close losses into wins

Explosive run game could be the key spark the Jets need to break through against tough opponents

Coach Aaron Glenn highlights Fields‚Äô unique athleticism and game-changing ability as Jets seek consistency

Justin Fields leads with energy and motivation to keep Jets‚Äô locker room positive amid early-season struggles

The New York Jets enter Week 5 still hunting for their first victory of the season, and quarterback Justin Fields insists the turnaround must begin on offense. With three of their four losses coming by a single score, Fields believes sharper execution, fewer penalties, and better ball security could be the difference between being ‚Äúclose‚Äù and finally breaking through. As the Jets prepare to host the Dallas Cowboys at MetLife Stadium, urgency is rising but so is belief that a breakthrough is near.Fields acknowledged that the Jets have not been outplayed so much as out-executed in critical moments. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve lost three games by one score,‚Äù he reflected, noting that minimizing turnovers and penalties would instantly flip narrow defeats into wins. For him, accountability extends beyond the locker room and onto the coaching staff as well. ‚ÄúTo secure those dubs, everybody has to be on the same page ‚Äî not only the players but the coaches and everyone around the building,‚Äù he said.Against recent opponents, the Jets showed flashes of a productive rushing attack that set the tone early. Fields highlighted the first drive last week where explosive runs carved through the defense, creating balance and rhythm. ‚ÄúThe run game makes my job easier,‚Äù he admitted, pointing to how sustained ground production opens lanes for both his arm and his legs.His dual-threat ability was on display with a highlight-reel 43-yard touchdown run that, according to head coach Aaron Glenn, might have covered nearly 90 yards of scrambling in total.Glenn did not hold back in applauding his quarterback‚Äôs resilience and athleticism. ‚ÄúHe never ceases to amaze me when he‚Äôs running with the ball,‚Äù the coach said. ‚ÄúBecause he‚Äôs such a big, strong man, able to elude and make people miss in space.‚Äù For Glenn, those are the kinds of plays the Jets have to build upon, knowing that Fields‚Äô improvisation can turn a stagnant drive into a game-changing moment. The challenge, however, remains sustaining that energy for four full quarters without costly lapses.As one of the team captains, Fields has leaned into his leadership role, rallying teammates through tough stretches. After Monday‚Äôs loss, he addressed the locker room to remind players that their confidence must not waver. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs my job as quarterback and as one of the leaders to make sure everybody feels that energy,‚Äù he said. Fields emphasized that morale remains high despite setbacks, with the group determined to ‚Äúget back to work this week and go out there on Sunday and play ball. ‚ÄùWith the Cowboys looming, the Jets know opportunities cannot be squandered. Cleaning up mental errors, sticking to the run game, and maximizing Fields‚Äô dynamic skillset are central to their game plan. For a team that has been on the verge of victories but unable to close, Week 5 provides both a test and a chance at redemption. If Fields‚Äô message of accountability resonates, MetLife Stadium could witness the Jets‚Äô long-awaited first win of the season.Also read: Who is Jason Taylor‚Äôs wife?

In an interview centered on his Hertz ad campaign for their online car-buying service, he touched on Travis Kelce 's engagement to Taylor Swift , which was announced just before the NFL season started.During the interview, Brady gave some comforting tips to Kelce about juggling his football career and personal life. ""It‚Äôs all part of growing up,"" Brady told TODAY.com.Brady also complimented Kelce's skills on the field, pointing out, ‚ÄúI really think Travis is a great player. I‚Äôve gotten a chance to cover him a lot.‚Äù He added that Kelce ‚Äúis going to go into the Hall of Fame as one of the great tight ends‚Äù He talked about how much he enjoys being an analyst for Kelce's games.Concluding his thoughts, Brady remarked, ‚ÄúSeems like things are going great,‚Äù talking about Kelce's success in his career and his romance with Swift. This optimistic view implies that Brady believes Kelce is effectively managing his rising fame and personal achievements while excelling in football, just like Brady did throughout his career.Travis Kelce has been a crucial part of the Chiefs' winning streak, helping them clinch the Vince Lombardi Trophy three times over five years.Being a tight end, he has become a prominent player in the league, which is remarkable by his accomplishing impressive levels of performance despite the significant attention his off-field activities receive.The loss for the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl 59 was a major setback which prevented them from pulling off an amazing three-peat. Still, such comments from Brady do not appear to take away from Kelce's legacy or chances for success down the line.Right now, Brady is the main NFL analyst for Fox Sports and also a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders, keeping him closely tied to the game. Plus, he's part of a Hertz campaign that highlights their online car-buying services.Tom Brady is going to take part in the Fanatics Flag Football Classic on March 21, 2026, at Kingdom Arena in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Responding to rumors that this might mean he's coming back to play, Tom Brady explained, ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not like I ever played flag football before, so I‚Äôm not technically unretiring to play. It‚Äôs kind of like a new initiative.‚Äù He pointed out the event's appeal, stating, ‚ÄúBut what I‚Äôve always loved about football is throwing the ball and connecting with my teammates and this would just be a really fun day to be a part of, and I think it‚Äôs going to be just a terrific event. ‚ÄùTravis Kelce is rocking it with the Kansas City Chiefs while navigating life in the limelight with Taylor Swift, proving he can take on every obstacle on and off the field with unmatched power.Also Read: Travis Kelce calls his birthday ‚Äúan annoying day‚Äù as the Kansas City Chiefs star about to turn 36","Tom brady recently talked about how he manages his personal and professional life during the football season.

Emari Demercado moves up after Trey Benson injury



Emari Demercado and Michael Carter prepare for bigger challenge

‚ÄúWe trust Emari and Michael to step in and compete,‚Äù

Emari Demercado is set for a much bigger role with the Arizona Cardinals starting Sunday, October 6, 2025, against the Tennessee Titans. The team announced that rookie running back Trey Benson will be placed on injured reserve with a knee injury, which means he will miss at least four games. With James Conner already out for the season due to a foot injury, the Cardinals will now lean heavily on Emari Demercado and Michael Carter to carry the load.Emari Demercado, 25, looked sharp in last week‚Äôs 23-20 loss to the Seattle Seahawks on Thursday night. In that game, he rushed twice for eight yards and caught both of his targets for 13 yards, including a touchdown reception.His quick play and ability to adjust to short passes gave the Cardinals confidence to use him more often. Trey Benson‚Äôs knee injury, suffered during the Week 4 game, changes the rotation.With Benson sidelined, Demercado and Michael Carter will share most of the snaps in the backfield. Carter, who weighs 201 pounds, has speed and receiving ability, but Demercado, at 215 pounds, is expected to handle more inside carries. Bam Knight, signed earlier this season, will move into the No. 3 running back role.Also Read: Cowboys Vs. Packers On Sunday Night Football: Micah Parsons‚Äô Dallas Return Fuels High-Stakes Week 4 Clash Head coach Jonathan Gannon spoke to reporters after practice on Friday in Tempe, Arizona.Gannon said. He praised Demercado‚Äôs energy and pointed out how quickly he has adjusted to the Cardinals‚Äô system.Michael Carter, 25, joined the Cardinals last year after spending time with the New York Jets. He will be used more in passing plays, while Demercado could see an increase in short-yardage and red-zone work. This mix makes both players important for fantasy football managers, especially in point-per-reception formats.With James Conner on season-ending injured reserve since September, and now Trey Benson out, the Cardinals may look to add another running back in the coming weeks. For now, the spotlight turns to Emari Demercado, who will get his first real chance to lead the Cardinals‚Äô backfield this Sunday in Nashville against the Titans.","Emari demercado is set for a much bigger role with the arizona cardinals starting sunday, october 6, 2025, against the tennessee titans.

Erik Johnson‚Äôs legacy and lasting impact on hockey

Erik Johnson Equalizes For the Avalanche With Blue Line Snipe

The NHL may have had its own surprises during each season, yet sometimes the offseason brings the most emotional moments. Now, the fans, analysts, and even some former players are thinking about Erik Johnson: a name that used to be synonymous with steady defense, leadership, and championship mettle. The Avalanche faithful know just how much Johnson has been a central figure in their identity. In a way, his retirement marks the end of an era and the celebration of a life defined by resilience and loyalty.Wednesday afternoon saw the official announcement via social media from the Colorado Avalanche that Erik Johnson had decided to retire from professional hockey. The 17-year veteran spent 14 years in Colorado, playing in 1,023 games and recording 348 points derived from 95 goals and 253 assists. The trusted blue-liner also logged 1,717 blocked shots and 1,695 hits, leaving a physical imprint on the game.In a way, the 2021‚Äì22 season marked the climax of his career, winning the Stanley Cup for the Avalanche. Johnson probably felt 18 years in the NHL was enough, and, with immense gratitude in his farewell message, he announced his retirement. A word of thanks to the Avalanche, his former teams, his teammates, coaches, and fans, but most of all to his family that has stood by him through it all.He stated that hockey was his life, and now he looked toward the future with lots of excitement but also with a heart full of fond memories given by the sport to him.The Blues drafted Johnson in 2006 first overall, making him one of only two American-born defensemen ever to receive that honor. Apart from his draft-day history, Johnson became one of only six defensemen chosen first overall to actually skate in 1,000 NHL games. Other than with the Blues, Sabres, and Flyers, Colorado remained his true hockey home.There were alleged PTO opportunities, but Johnson was adamant about doing it on his terms, walking away with dignity. Unbeaten for his consistency and leadership, he stands eighth in games played on the Avalanche's all-time leaderboard. To fans, he was more than just a player; he was a defining element of the franchise for two decades.With the retirement of Erik Johnson, a chapter of grit, loyalty, sacrifice, and championship memories closes. While life will go on in the NHL, his presence in Colorado and all across the league will stand as an inspiration to young defensemen who are vying to live the same dream.Also Read: New Jersey Devils lock down defenseman Luke Hughes with 7-year $63 million deal","Colorado avalanche defenseman erik johnson announced his retirement on wednesday.

Auston Matthews gets slammed by former NHL player Sean Avery



Auston Matthews‚Äô performance on the ice was highly criticised in the last season



The Toronto Maple Leafs‚Äô captain and one of the most popular players in the league, Auston Matthews, had a rough season last time as he was dealing with his injuries. The Leafs‚Äô captain ended up appearing in only 67 games last season and the team recorded a pretty poor performance on the ice.

He was back here early in the summer. It is amazing; when he shows up, it seems like everyone else is here now, too. He was here probably a month before we got going, and with the preparation he puts toward his craft and the way he practices, he sets the standard.‚ÄùAuston Matthews spent the whole of last season trying to recover from his injuries and could only participate in 67 games total. This had sparked concern among fans as many criticised his focus and performance on the ice.While Auston Matthews looks pretty fit in the new season, the recent losses in the preseason has sparked some concern and panic among the Leafs' fans.Also Read: ""He's in a position of power"": Chris Pronger and Luke Gazdic react to Connor McDavid‚Äôs uncertain future with the Edmonton Oilers","Former nhl player sean avery slammed auston matthews on the spittin‚Äô chicklets podcast.

Giants locker room drama: Russell Wilson looks ‚Äòdisgusted‚Äô during Dart‚Äôs postgame hype speech



Not all fans are convinced that this is the ‚Äúlook of hatred‚Äù



Giants fans, the drama is real. A video from Sunday‚Äôs locker room has gone viral, showing Russell Wilson giving rookie QB Jaxson Dart a look that can only be described as ‚Äúdisgusted.‚Äù Dart, fresh off leading the Giants to a 21‚Äì18 upset over the previously undefeated Chargers, was delivering a pumped-up postgame speech when Wilson‚Äôs unimpressed glare stole the show.

Wilson, who started the season as the Giants‚Äô quarterback, was benched after an 0‚Äì3 start, paving the way for Dart to take over the offense.Sunday‚Äôs win marked Dart‚Äôs first major statement as the team‚Äôs starter, and his locker room speech was full of energy, motivation, and hype for the team.Meanwhile, Wilson was caught looking, well, less than thrilled. Whether it was frustration, disbelief, or just a classic ‚Äúbenchwarmer mood,‚Äù his expression instantly became a meme-worthy moment for fans.As soon as the video hit social media, fans went wild. The clip sparked heated debates about team dynamics, the QB room vibe, and whether Wilson‚Äôs reaction hinted at tension behind the scenes or if he was simply a stoic competitor.Before fans spiral into full conspiracy mode, it‚Äôs important to note that Wilson has publicly expressed support for Dart and emphasized his commitment to the Giants. Still, a picture or in this case, a side-eye video can speak louder than words. The moment has added a new layer of intrigue to the Giants‚Äô quarterback saga, keeping fans glued to social media as they analyze every subtle expression and gesture from the locker room.Locker room dynamics aside, the Giants now have an energized rookie leading the offense while a veteran quarterback watches from the sidelines. Wilson‚Äôs viral glare reminds everyone that competition breeds tension, but it also pushes the team to improve. Whether his expression was innocent, iconic, or somewhere in between, one thing is clear, fans will be watching, laughing, and debating every step of the way, especially as Dart continues to prove he belongs under center.Also read - Malik Nabers‚Äô knee injury looks worse than it is‚Äîhere‚Äôs why Giants fans can chill","Russell wilson gave rookie qb jaxson dart a look that can only be described as ‚Äúdisgusted.‚Äù dart was delivering a pumped-up postgame speech when wilson‚Äôs unimpressed glare stole the show.

Former Pakistan cricket captain Shahid Afridi has urged Mohsin Naqvi to step down from one of his two positions - either as Pakistan Cricket Board chairman or as Minister of Interior.Afridi believes Pakistan cricket requires full attention, which Naqvi cannot provide while managing both roles simultaneously.Naqvi's tenure as PCB chairman since 2024 has been marked by challenges. Under his leadership, Pakistan has struggled in home Test matches, the 2025 Champions Trophy, and now in the Asia Cup.Despite improved performance under new coach Mike Hesson, the team's showing in the 2025 Asia Cup was mixed, with victories overshadowed by three losses against India.""My request or advice to Naqvi Saheb is that these are two very important posts, and they are big jobs that need time. PCB is totally different from the Interior Ministry, so it must be kept separate,"" Afridi told Telecom Asia Sport.""It would be a big decision and should be taken as soon as possible. Pakistan cricket needs special attention and time‚Ä¶ Naqvi cannot rely totally on advisers. These advisers are taking him nowhere and he himself says that he doesn't know much about cricket. He needs to appoint good and competent advisers who know about the game.""Naqvi's responsibilities have expanded further with his appointment as chairman of the Asian Cricket Council (ACC). His leadership during the 2025 Asia Cup was marked by controversy, particularly regarding his interactions with India.The tournament's conclusion was notable for an incident during the trophy presentation. When India emerged victorious, they expressed reluctance to receive the trophy from Naqvi, citing his previous anti-India positions.In response, Naqvi left the stadium with the winners' trophy.These events have added to the growing pressure on Naqvi, who continues to balance his multiple roles in Pakistani cricket administration and government. His effectiveness in managing these diverse responsibilities has become a subject of discussion in cricket circles.","Shahid afridi has urged mohsin naqvi to step down from one of his two positions - either as pakistan cricket board chairman or as minister of interior.
