Connor McDavid’s next deal could be historic, but it comes with conditions



Loyalty now, but exit still on the table



FAQs:



1. Why were Connor McDavid's contract talks delayed?

2. Is Connor McDavid committed to staying in Edmonton long-term?

3. What makes Connor McDavid’s next contract so significant?

After weeks of mounting speculation, Connor McDavid is reportedly ready to open contract discussions with the Edmonton Oilers. This long-anticipated move comes after a brief silence that sparked rumors of a possible exit. However, recent developments suggest the franchise’s cornerstone is still committed - for now. The reigning best player in the NHL may stay loyal to Edmonton, but the fine print of his next deal could shape the future of both McDavid and the team.Connor McDavid isn’t just negotiating any contract- he’s expected to ink a deal that would make him the highest-paid player in NHL history. NHL insider Frank Seravalli weighed in, noting, “I don’t think $20 million is unreasonable given what he provides and how significant of an impact he has as the best player in the world. If I were looking at the Connor McDavid situation, as best I can handicap it at this point in time, my guess is somewhere between $16 and $17.5 million in AAV. Those are just ballparks. That’s the best that I can glean at this moment in time.” Seravalli estimates the ballpark figure to be between $16 million and $17.5 million in average annual value (AAV).Yet, despite the optimism surrounding a massive contract, it’s not just about the money.McDavid is likely weighing more than just figures—he’s considering legacy. The Oilers have repeatedly fallen short of lifting the Stanley Cup, including a bitter playoff exit to the Florida Panthers last season. If that trend continues, the superstar’s patience might wear thin.While rumors about McDavid potentially heading to the Toronto Maple Leafs made waves recently, those talks have cooled. He remains expected to sign an extension with Edmonton. However, Seravalli provided a warning rooted in McDavid’s immense leverage: “If he decides after four years or three years or whatever that the Edmonton Oilers aren’t getting it done...the best player in the world just raises his hand and says: ‘I want out. ’”This isn’t just hypothetical. McDavid has been eligible to extend his contract since July 1, but personal matters reportedly delayed the process. Now, discussions are finally set to commence—but for how long will Edmonton be enough? The specter of a late-career switch, especially to his hometown Maple Leafs, still looms.The Oilers need more than just a signature. They need to prove to McDavid that Edmonton is where champions are made. Because if the promise of the Stanley Cup continues to fade, even the most loyal star might look elsewhere for glory. However, no matter to what extent trade rumors appear, it is Connor McDavid, who will decide his future. Will he become the highest paid player in league? Fans and critics will be watching very closely.Contract discussions were delayed due to personal matters, but they are now expected to begin soon.He is expected to sign an extension, but could leave if the Oilers fail to deliver results in the coming years.His upcoming deal is projected to make him the highest-paid player in NHL history, reflecting his elite impact on the game.Also Read: Without Mitch Marner, can Auston Matthews still carry the Maple Leafs to a Stanley Cup?","Connor mcdavid is reportedly ready to open contract discussions with the edmonton oilers.

Are the Edmonton Oilers interested in signing Carter Hart?

Why are Carter Hart and the Hockey Canada Five not allowed to play in the NHL?

Have the Edmonton Oilers given second chances to players before?

Carter Hart may not be getting a chance with the Edmonton Oilers. NHL insider Frank Seravalli said on July 28, 2025, that the team is not interested in signing the goalie. Hart and four other players were part of the Hockey Canada Five case. Although they were found not guilty in court, the NHL has said the five players cannot play for now. Seravalli called Hart a “non‑starter” for the Oilers and said the league will review the case before making a final decision.Justice Maria Sarroccia ruled last week in Ontario’s King’s Court that Carter Hart and four teammates were not guilty in the Hockey Canada Five case. The players had faced sexual assault charges from a 2018 incident in London, Ontario. The judge said the complainant, known as E.M., gave consent and that parts of her story were not credible.Despite the verdict, the NHL told teams the players remain ineligible to sign until the commissioner’s office finishes its review. Frank Seravalli discussed this on TSN in Toronto on July 28. On the same day, Bob Stauffer, who hosts the Oilers Now show in Edmonton, asked fans and guests if the Oilers should sign any of the cleared players.Stauffer has raised this question several times since the ruling.On July 29, Stauffer invited former NHL agent and GM Brian Lawton to the show. Lawton said,He added that the players may find it easier to sign with a U.S. team where hockey is less in the public eye.Also Read: Edmonton Oilers Face Uncertainty As Connor McDavid Eyes Short-Term NHL Contract Extension At Potential Record Salary The Oilers have a history of second chances. Last summer, Edmonton hired Stan Bowman as GM even though he had served a three‑year NHL suspension for mishandling a sexual assault case in Chicago in 2010. The team also signed players like Craig MacTavish, Zack Kassian, Evander Kane and Corey Perry when they faced serious problems. Many of those players rebuilt their careers and image in Edmonton.Now, with Carter Hart and the other four players, fans are wondering if the Oilers are changing their approach. NHL sources say the team has no current plans to sign any of them.Now, with Carter Hart and the others cleared in court but still banned by the NHL, fans wonder if Edmonton will stick to its history of second chances or shift course entirely.Despite past patterns of forgiveness, the Oilers appear cautious now. Public opinion, league pressure, and reputation risks may force a pause, suggesting this case marks a turning point for Edmonton.No, NHL insider Frank Seravalli said the Oilers have no plans to sign Carter Hart right now.The NHL has kept them ineligible until the commissioner’s office finishes its review of the 2018 case.Yes, the Oilers have signed players like Stan Bowman, Evander Kane, and Corey Perry after past issues.","Edmonton oilers bold stand on carter hart sparks nationwide outrage among nhl fans.

Micah Parsons pushes for massive deal amid growing trade talk



Cowboys’ history shows negotiations could drag

The Dallas Cowboys and star linebacker Micah Parsons are locked in a contract battle that has grabbed the attention of NFL fans. Parsons, the heart of the Cowboys’ defense, is growing frustrated with team owner Jerry Jones as negotiations drag on. His recent social media post has only fueled speculation that he could soon push for a trade if his demands aren’t met.Parsons is entering the final stretch of his five-year rookie contract and is expecting a massive raise. He reportedly wants to become one of the highest-paid non-quarterbacks in the NFL, aiming for a deal similar to Pittsburgh Steelers’ star T.J. Watt. According to The Athletic’s Dianna Russini, the linebacker is prepared to either request a trade or cut ties with the team if the Cowboys refuse to meet his price.The tension became public when Parsons posted a GIF captioned “one last time” on Thursday night, sparking trade rumors across social media. He has openly said he wants to remain in Dallas but also made it clear that the decision is in the front office’s hands. “I want to be here. I’ve always said I want to be here,” Parsons explained last week. “But at the end of the day, they sign the checks like always. Let’s see if they want me to be here.Cowboys fans have seen this play out before. Jerry and Stephen Jones are known for tough negotiations and often wait until the last moment to finalize deals with their star players. They used the same strategy with quarterback Dak Prescott, ultimately signing him to a huge extension after months of uncertainty.The Cowboys could be cautious about giving Parsons a long-term deal because of injury concerns, which have burned them in the past. But unless a team offers a blockbuster trade package, Dallas is unlikely to let its defensive anchor go. Parsons is too valuable to their Super Bowl hopes, and history suggests the Cowboys will eventually get a deal done.Also Read: Micah Parsons’ intensifying contract dispute puts Dallas Cowboys in crucial decision-making moment For now, all eyes remain on Micah Parsons.

Punk is the favorite to take home gold, having earned this spot by winning a gauntlet match earlier this month.

“She’s the brains”: Aaron Rodgers opens up on how his sister-in-law helped seal his $13.65M Pittsburgh Steelers deal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/shes-the-brains-aaron-rodgers-opens-up-on-how-his-sister-in-law-helped-seal-his-13-65m-pittsburgh-steelers-deal/articleshow/123046949.cms,"Aaron Rodgers reveals the truth behind his one-year deal with the Pittsburgh Steelers (Image via Imagn Images)

Aaron Rodgers says his sister-in-law was the unexpected power player

Rodgers says he doesn't need the money — he's playing for something bigger in Pittsburgh

“I like our chances”: Aaron Rodgers believes the Steelers are built to compete for a championship

Aaron Rodgers didn’t just take a pay cut this offseason—he let someone unexpected call the shots. The future Hall of Famer surprised fans by crediting his 20-year-old sister-in-law, Mia, for helping shape his one-year deal with the Pittsburgh Steelers. Instead of chasing a massive payday, Rodgers chose purpose over price—and now he’s setting his sights on one more Super Bowl run. And yes, Mia might deserve some of the credit if it happens.Rodgers signed a one-year, $13.65 million contract with Pittsburgh—well below market value for a quarterback of his stature. But during media availability, he joked that he wasn’t really the one making the final call. “I was taking orders from my (new) sister-in-law, Mia,” he said, smiling. “She’s 20 and she’s the brains of the family; you just have to ask her.”The remark quickly caught attention, not just for its humor, but for what it revealed about Rodgers' current headspace—calmer, more grounded, and surrounded by a family circle that clearly weighs in. He added, “No — but that is partially serious for sure,” hinting that Mia’s influence wasn’t entirely a punchline.While other quarterbacks may have chased bigger numbers, Rodgers went in with a different pitch: he wasn’t in it for the money.“Every team that I talked to, I said, ‘Listen, if I play, I’m not going to take a ton of money. I’ve made a ton of money. I don’t need the money,’” he said.It’s a veteran move from someone who’s already secured his legacy but wants one last chapter to matter—on his terms. That mindset made Pittsburgh the right landing spot: a historic franchise, passionate fanbase, and a team ready for a leader, not just a quarterback.Rodgers didn’t just show up in Pittsburgh to ride out his final season—he believes this team has real title potential. “A lot of guys are battle-strong and have been through some tough stuff,” he said, referencing the roster’s resilience.He also praised head coach Mike Tomlin’s leadership: “And with the leadership we’ve got — and with Mike T. — I like our chances.” That vote of confidence from a seasoned vet signals he’s not settling; he’s aiming high, and he believes this locker room can get there.Whether Mia actually helped draw up the terms or simply offered emotional support, Rodgers’ shoutout made waves for its authenticity.

Poll What do you think is Mohammed Siraj's greatest attribute as a bowler? Skill and technique Heart and determination Fitness and stamina Tactical awareness

TimesofIndia.com in London: "" Mohammed Siraj has one muscle that's bigger than anyone else... his heart.""These were the words of Varun Aaron during commentary but these were the sentiments of everyone watching from the stands at The Oval or home. Another lion-hearted spell, another outing of honest effort and Mohammed Siraj showed why he continues to be a rare breed.It wasn't a spell where you would stand up and applaud a delivery for sheer skill or work of art. It wasn't a spell where the seam position after release would become muse for the photographers. And, it clearly wasn't a spell where the mischief from the pitch came to his support. It was, however, another spell from the maverick playing his fifth consecutive Test, which had intent written all over it.When he hits the rhythm, like he did during that eight-over burst post Lunch, he turns into a different beast and the ball behaves differently than it had done all day, even from the same spot. That extra effort, even in the fifth Test of the series where he has already sent down over 150 overs, is not just a reflection of his skill but a testament of his character, which he wears on his sleeve.Those three wickets in the second session ran through the opposition middle-order and allowed India to fight their way back into the game after a very ordinary start with the new ball.But the moment the ball lost its shine, the 31-year-old looked in far more control and kept pinging the right areas, and the effort took care of the rest.Ollie Pope, Joe Root, Jacob Bethell didn't survive the frentic period of play. While the first two were undone by sharp inward movement and those extra yards after pitching, Bethell had no clue about the inswinging yorker which trapped him right in front. That yorker was fired in his seventh straight over of the spell but he had his tail up and the spring in the stride continued for one more over before captain Shubman Gill got him off the attack.It was another unreal effort by the bowler who has given it his all in different conditions and situations throughout the series. He has been the workhorse for the Indian team in their second consecutive five-Test series and served another reminder of why he needs to be celebrated, and appreciated even more. Siraj is one player who shouldn't be judged on just wickets, strike-rate and other numerical readings.He puts his heart and soul every time he steps onto the field for the team, and there clearly are no half-measures. He had thanked the almighty for blessing him with good fitness but more than the blessings, it's his will, drive and energy which keeps him going. And kept him going on an overcast afternoon at The Oval. In a series where bowlers from both teams have been rotated, managed and preserved, Siraj has remained an exception who has run in hard every single time.The right-armer is a proper team man, captain's dream and opposition's nightmare as he doesn't give an inch as far as effort is concerned. There are off days, erratic spells, lack of rhythm but no dearth of intent. While others keep their biomechanics in check for these marathon outings, Siraj doesn't need to complicate. For him, it's all about putting his heart behind the ball every time he stands on top of the bowling mark. He has already done it on 932 occasions in the series, and looks ready to go all in one last time in the second essay.","Mohammed siraj took three wickets in eight overs on day two of 5th test. Ollie pope, joe root, jacob bethell didn't survive the frentic period of play.

Poll What did you think about the on-field exchange between Prasidh Krishna and Joe Root? It was just banter It was unprofessional It shows competitive spirit

India pacer Prasidh Krishna downplayed his on-field exchange with Joe Root, calling it “just good banter” after a fiery second day in the fifth and final Test at The Oval on Friday, where India clawed their way back into the contest thanks to an inspired bowling performance.Krishna, who returned to the playing XI, starred with figures of 4 for 62 as India bowled England out for 247, restricting their lead to just 23 runs after the hosts were cruising at 129/1. Mohammed Siraj also chipped in with 4 for 86, helping India take back control of a match they must win to level the series 2-2.Among the key moments was a heated exchange between Krishna and Root, who uncharacteristically had to be separated by the umpires. ""It was a small thing, a competitive edge. Good banter… we are good friends off the field,"" Krishna clarified at the end of play.Krishna also addressed questions about the absence of Jasprit Bumrah and his own role in the side. “Jasprit Bumrah playing or not playing… we know what our roles are,” he said. “I have been picked here because I can do the job. Me not playing games can make me go to the drawing board. Here to do the job for the team.It’s a process, not a performance for me.”England had earlier made a flying start, with Zak Crawley (64) and Ben Duckett (43) adding 92 in just 13 overs. But the momentum shifted quickly after Akash Deep dismissed Duckett.Root was eventually trapped lbw by Siraj for 29, while Krishna’s spell accounted for Crawley, Jamie Smith, and Overton in quick succession. Brook’s enterprising 53 ended when Siraj bowled him to wrap up the innings. Woakes, nursing a shoulder injury, did not bat.India ended the day at 75/2 in their second innings, leading by 52, with Yashasvi Jaiswal unbeaten on 51.","India bowled england out for 247, restricting their lead to just 23 runs.

Easton Cowan targets NHL debut as Maple Leafs enter new era after Mitch Marner trade

“He’s going to push to make the team...

I’m betting he’s going to make it.”

Maple Leafs’ crowded forward lineup creates uphill battle for Easton Cowan’s NHL roster spot

After parting ways with star winger Mitch Marner in a blockbuster sign-and-trade with the Vegas Golden Knights, the Toronto Maple Leafs find themselves in a period of transition. While they've added depth through trades, one name creating buzz is 2023 first-round pick Easton Cowan. The 19-year-old forward is determined to turn heads at training camp and stake his claim on the Leafs’ opening night roster.With Marner’s departure freeing up cap space and creating a void in Toronto’s top six, the Maple Leafs have retooled by acquiring Matias Maccelli, Nicolas Roy, and Dakota Joshua. But Cowan, the 28th overall pick in the 2023 NHL Draft could be the most intriguing addition to the offensive mix. Known for his speed, two-way play, and high-pressure performance, Cowan is expected to seriously challenge for a roster spot this fall.Cowan starred with the OHL’s London Knights, scoring 83 goals and 218 points in 168 games over three seasons. His playoff numbers were even more impressive: 94 points in 55 games, including key performances in two OHL championships and a Memorial Cup victory this past season. His coach, Dale Hunter, recently endorsed his NHL readiness on The FAN Morning Show, stating:Despite his standout junior résumé and growing confidence, Cowan faces an uphill battle. Toronto already has 14 forwards on one-way NHL deals for 2025–26, not including restricted free agent Nicholas Robertson, whose future with the team remains uncertain amid trade speculation.If Robertson stays, Cowan’s route to the NHL becomes narrower, but there could still be opportunities. He may need to outplay veterans like Calle Järnkrok or Michael Pezzetta to earn a bottom-six role, with the possibility of moving up the lineup as the season progresses. Cowan has publicly stated that he thrives under pressure and welcomes the challenge of high-stakes environments like Toronto.Easton Cowan’s NHL readiness is becoming hard to ignore. With a strong development camp and training camp ahead, he has the tools, confidence, and timing to make a serious push. As the Maple Leafs shift into a post-Marner era, Cowan’s rise could become one of the most compelling storylines of the season.Also Read: Connor McDavid contract update: Edmonton Oilers GM Stan Bowman ‘encouraged’ by early NHL extension talks with superstar forward","Easton cowan is a 2023 first-round pick of the toronto maple leafs.

A.J. Brown says Micah Parsons “wanna be an Eagle”and it might not be just talk



Million Dollaz Worth of Game

“Micah wanna be an Eagle. He loves Philly.”

Micah Parsons calls out Cowboys in emotional goodbye post, says he “no longer wants to be here”



“Unfortunately I no longer want to be here.”

Dez Bryant backs Parsons for standing his ground: “Much bigger than football”



“I respect that you are standing on business... What you are doing is much bigger than the game of football.”

Is Micah Parsons really headed to Philly? It’s not just a fantasy anymore



What started as a tense offseason for the Dallas Cowboys just took a spicy, NFC East-shaking turn and the Eagles might be the ones laughing. After Micah Parsons’ emotional statement blasting Cowboys management, Eagles star wideout A.J. Brown previous comment is making rounds on the internet.Now with Cowboys legend Dez Bryant backing Parsons and Parsons himself looking fed up with Dallas, fans are wondering, is this how the NFC’s biggest rivalry gets even more personal?On one of the episodes of thepodcast, A.J. Brown didn’t hold back. He said exactly what Philly fans wanted to hear:And here’s the thing, it actually makes a lot of sense. Parsons is a Pennsylvania native. He grew up in Harrisburg. He went to Penn State. His roots run deep in the Keystone State. With his Cowboys situation imploding, Philly might not just be a random name-drop, it might be a real possibility.And let’s not forget, Micah Parsons and A.J. Brown are both represented by powerhouse agents and are well aware of how public perception shapes career leverage. Brown saying that out loud? That’s not an accident.That’s a message.Micah Parsons posted a long, heartfelt note to Cowboys fans. In it, he made it clear: he’s tired of the front office drama, failed negotiations, and feeling like he’s risking everything for a team that won’t commit.He revealed that his agent reached out to the Cowboys multiple times to start contract talks and they were met with silence. No texts. No emails. No effort. Instead, Parsons says the team let media narratives spin while he stayed quiet, hoping something would get done.But now? He’s done being quiet.Cowboys legend Dez Bryant wasted no time chiming in. He reposted Micah’s statement and gave him full support:Translation: Dez knows how ugly things can get with the Cowboys front office. He’s been there. He sees Parsons not just as a player taking control, but as a new-generation athlete refusing to play the same games past stars did. The respect is real.Micah Parsons in midnight green would send shockwaves through the league. He’s one of the most explosive defenders in the NFL, and pairing him with that Eagles front seven would be terrifying for the rest of the NFC.While there’s no official trade talk (yet). Whether it’s posturing or a genuine shift, one thing is clear: the Cowboys-Eagles beef just got a whole lot more personal.Also read - Antonio Brown trolls Shannon Sharpe saying he now has less money than his OnlyFans accuser",A.j.

There is still no end in sight to the Jonathan Kuminga drama. However, he is now receiving some intriguing offers from the Golden State Warriors and the Sacramento Kings. Devin Carter, Dario Saric, and second-round choices were the initial reported offer from the Sacramento Kings, but it was not going to be enough. According to reports, Sacramento Kings now want the player for Malik Monk and a first-round pick.The initial offers for a Jonathan Kuminga sign-and-trade have not impressed the Golden State Warriors . However, the most fascinating offer so far has reportedly been made. The Sacramento Kings, on the other hand, are looking to add some young players to their squad.Now, he is the target of their attention. By giving the NBA player a big role and the opportunity to thrive in ways the Golden State Warriors haven't been able to, they think they can maximize his potential.Hence, the Sacramento Kings have made a fresh offer for Jonathan Kuminga's trade, according to Sam Amick of The Athletic. He recently said:“The Kings have offered Malik Monk and a lottery-protected 2030 first-round pick to the Warriors for Jonathan Kuminga. Unlike the Suns’ four-year, $90 million proposal, Sacramento is only offering Kuminga a three-year contract.”He continued:“As for the Kings, which last spoke with the Warriors earlier this week, team sources say they’ve offered a three-year, $63 million deal for Kuminga in a proposal that would send veteran guard Malik Monk and their 2030 first-round pick (lottery protected) to the Warriors…”He then concluded:“If that pick didn’t convey, then the Warriors would get the least favorable of the Kings or San Antonio’s first-round pick in 2031. Those protections have been the primary sticking point, team sources said, as the Warriors have insisted that the first-rounder be unprotected. Thus, the stalemate…”This is a substantial offer. When the Sacramento Kings first tried to trade for Jonathan Kuminga, they offered a far lesser package.

Fans praise Scheffler’s values as Brady gets dragged for preaching success at all costs

FAQs:

Q1: What advice did Tom Brady give to Scottie Scheffler?

Q2: What did Scottie Scheffler originally say?

Q3: How did fans react to the debate?

Tom Brady may be the undisputed GOAT on the football field, but when it comes to giving life advice? Let’s just say the Internet isn’t handing him a trophy. The seven-time Super Bowl champ recently offered some unsolicited wisdom to golf star Scottie Scheffler and it seriously backfired. In a now-viral moment, conservative sports commentator Jason Whitlock absolutely torched Brady’s remarks, calling them “elite idiocy” and suggesting Brady’s the last guy who should be preaching about family values.This all started with Scheffler humbly saying that if golf ever interfered with being a good husband or dad, he’d walk away from the game. Enter Brady, who interpreted that as a little too soft and tried to coach him into chasing greatness instead. Big mistake. Because fans and analysts alike weren’t buying what Brady was selling.On his “Change the Game” newsletter, Brady decided to drop a take about Scheffler’s viral family-first remarks. The quarterback praised the golfer’s humility but pushed back on the idea of quitting for family, saying:He followed it up with a line about how pursuing greatness is also how you provide for your family. But this Brady-branded wisdom didn’t exactly land the way he hoped, especially given his very public divorce from Gisele Bündchen, which was allegedly sparked by him un-retiring from football.Jason Whitlock did not hold back. On his YouTube, the outspoken host unleashed a savage takedown of Brady’s statement.On hispodcast, Jason Whitlock ripped into Brady’s advice to Scottie Scheffler, calling it out as hypocritical and lacking in self-awareness. He argued that Scheffler’s faith-first approach makes him a better role model than Brady, who once prioritized greatness over family.Social media quickly picked sides and Scheffler became the fan favorite. Many praised the golfer’s humility, saying it was refreshing to see a top athlete openly prioritize marriage and fatherhood over fame and legacy.Meanwhile, Brady got dragged. Critics said he should’ve just sat this one out, especially considering how his “greatness above all” mindset may have cost him a marriage. Some even said he’s still out of touch with where culture is heading where emotional intelligence, values, and faith are increasingly part of the conversation around masculinity.Tom Brady may have meant well, but his attempt to mentor Scottie Scheffler turned into a viral misstep. Fans aren’t canceling the GOAT, but they’re making it clear: today’s athletes are rewriting what greatness really looks like and it doesn’t always come with a ring.Brady told Scheffler that chasing greatness often comes with personal sacrifice and suggested not to abandon career success in favor of family balance.Scheffler said in an interview that if golf ever interfered with his ability to be a good husband or father, he would walk away from the sport without hesitation.Fans overwhelmingly supported Scheffler and criticized Brady for being out of touch. Many praised Scheffler for prioritizing faith and family.Also read - Shannon Sharpe officially out at ESPN just weeks after $50M sexual assault lawsuit settlement","Tom brady gave unsolicited advice to golf star scottie scheffler.
