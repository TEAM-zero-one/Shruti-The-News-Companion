Madison Beer may draw most of the spotlight as Justin Herbert 's girlfriend, and it makes sense. Her rising music career, her fashion profile and her massive fanbase always place her at the center of attention. Yet the scene at the Chargers' recent Sunday Night Football win over the Pittsburgh Steelers shifted the focus in a surprising way. The singer arrived with her mom, Tracie, and that moment created its own buzz. It was Tracie’s first football game, and her presence added a warm and unexpected layer to the night.The timing for their outing could not have been better. Beer is celebrating the excitement around her new single ""Bittersweet"" and gearing up for the release of her album ""Locket"" in January 2026. Herbert, meanwhile, continues his strong run as a 27-year-old Pro Bowler with a five-year, $262.5 million extension, including $218.7 million guaranteed. While the star quarterback carries pressure on the field, the support system around him and Madison seems steady.Beer has been a dedicated presence at Chargers games and their team Halloween events. Her matchy sailor costume with Herbert became one of the cute highlights of the season.But this time, her mom unintentionally stole the scene with a charming Instagram Reels selfie. Viewers quickly noticed how much she looks like Madison. Tracie already has 126k followers and describes herself with the line, ""Proud Mom of @madisonbeer & @ryderbeer. .. Inventor of the @halterhanger... Dog lover, who loves fashion, skincare & makeup! 💝""She wore a full Chargers outfit and later panned the camera toward Madison, who did a playful shimmy next to her. Their close bond shows up often. When Madison announced her album, her mom posted, ""😍😍amazing 😍😍 so proud of you 😍😍."" Tracie also attended the Victoria’s Secret Fashion Show, where Madison owned the pink carpet with her all-black look and performance. Tracie even shared her own outfit from the night.Her quiet support continues behind the scenes too. At the Blue Jacket Los Angeles fashion show, she avoided talking about Madison's relationship, making a lips-zipped gesture. But she did tell TMZ that Madison ""is happy."" That happiness seemed clear during their cheerful night at SoFi Stadium, months after dating rumors began when Herbert appeared at one of her music video shoots in Los Angeles.","Madison beer's mom, tracie, was at the chargers' sunday night football win.

NEW DELHI: As counting begins, all eyes are on Kargahar Assembly constituency in Rohtas district, where the Congress is defending a slender victory margin amid a four-way contest this time.Sitting MLA Santosh Kumar Mishra (INC) is seeking to retain the seat he won in 2020, facing a renewed challenge from JD(U)’s Bashisth Singh and Jan Suraaj’s Ritesh Ranjan Pandey, the Bhojpuri singer-actor making his political debut. It also sees a friendly fight between MGB partners INC and CPI, with left candidate Mahendra Prasad Gupta also in the fray.The entry of Pandey has turned the contest into one of the most closely watched battles in southwest Bihar, bringing a mix of traditional party loyalties and celebrity appeal.In 2020, Santosh Kumar Mishra of the Indian National Congress secured victory with 59,763 votes (30.76 per cent) defeating Bashisth Singh of the Janata Dal (United) who secured 55,680 votes (28.66 per cent) - a margin of 4,083 votes. Historically, the JD(U) had held the seat since its creation post-2008 delimitation: Ram Dhani Singh (JD(U)) won in 2010 and Bashisth Singh (JD(U)) in 2015 before the Congress breakthrough in 2020.With roughly 20.4 per cent of the electorate from Scheduled Castes and around 6.4 per cent Muslim voters, the constituency remains entirely rural, and caste equations are considered critical. Political analysts are watching Kargahar closely this year because of the slim winning margin in 2020 and an emerging triangular contest in 2025. The result will indicate whether Congress can consolidate its hold or if JD(U) and its allies can reclaim the seat.The vote share of other major candidates in 2020 included Uday Pratap Singh (BSP) with 47,321 votes (24.35 per cent) and others trailing behind. As counting starts this morning, Kargahar’s outcome will be among the early indicators of how party-waves and local dynamics are shaping up ahead of broader results across Bihar.","Sitting mla santosh kumar mishra (inc) is seeking to retain the seat he won in 2020.

Tkachuk Brothers to bring NHL players’ stories to forefront with ‘Wingmen’ podcast



The Pat McAfee Show Live | Wednesday November 12th 2025

More coverage on NHL:

Hockey fans are about to experience a fresh, personality-driven podcast as Matthew and Brady Tkachuk officially announce Wingmen. Set to release weekly in partnership with Wave Sports & Entertainment, the show promises candid conversations, off-ice stories, and a behind-the-scenes look at life as two of the NHL’s most entertaining players. The format brings a new layer of accessibility to the sport, similar to how Travis and Jason Kelce’s New Heights energized football media.Both Tkachuk brothers have built reputations as standout personalities on and off the ice. Matthew, Florida Panthers left winger and two-time Stanley Cup winner, combines elite skill with a competitive edge that makes him impossible to ignore. Brady, Ottawa Senators’ captain, contributes leadership, humor, and a bold perspective, creating a dynamic partnership ideal for a podcast setting.Hockey has long lacked a platform for players to express themselves outside of the rink. Wingmen enters this space, joining the growing player-led podcast trend and offering fans direct access to the personalities behind the helmets. The Tkachuk brothers officially introduced the show on Wednesday, with the first episode set to drop on Thursday.“So, for us it’s super exciting,” Matthew said on The Pat McAfee Show.“We FaceTime pretty much daily, weekly, or whatever. Now we’re getting paid to do it once a week, are you kidding me? So it’s pretty exciting and I’m just super excited to grow the game.” After Matthew lifted the Stanley Cup with the Panthers and the season concluded, the podcast idea resurfaced and gained momentum over the summer. “It just kind of happened really quickly,” Matthew added. “And finally is actually happening.”The Kelce brothers’ New Heights illustrated how sports podcasts could transcend the game itself, and Wingmen is positioned to do the same for the NHL by providing a mix of humor, insight, and authentic storytelling. Guest potential for the podcast is significant, ranging from NHL stars like Connor McDavid and Sidney Crosby to personalities such as Paul Bissonnette, or even their father, Keith Tkachuk. The show could bridge the gap between casual hockey observers and diehard fans, making the sport more approachable while providing a platform for honest, entertaining dialogue.With its blend of authenticity, humor, and insider access, Wingmen is poised to become a standout player-led podcast in the NHL. The Tkachuk brothers’ new venture represents an exciting evolution in hockey media, combining personality, storytelling, and a fresh perspective that has been missing from the sport for years.","Matthew and brady tkachuk officially announce ‘wingmen’ podcast.

I’m sure they will… We have nothing to compete about. I’m looking forward to meeting him as I would anybody who’s accomplished in life what they have like he has.”Shaq further demonstrated his respect and understanding when Shaunie released her memoir, UNDEFEATED: Changing the Rules and Winning on My Own Terms. Addressing a statement about their past, he posted, “I understand. I wouldn’t have been in love with me either. Wishing you all the best. All love, Shaq.”Fans praised the NBA icon for supporting his ex-wife and mother of his children, highlighting that co-parenting can thrive on respect and maturity, even after high-profile relationships end.

Bahraini woman reaches Captain status

Who is Captain Fatima Nabeel Al Qaood?

Why does the A380 matter?

Bahraini women in aviation

Inspiration for the next generation





For the Kingdom of Bahrain, the year marks a soaring new chapter in its history books. Captain Fatima Nabeel Al Qaood has landed an unprecedented achievement, becoming the nation's first female Captain to command the majestic Airbus A380. Taking the controls of the world's largest passenger aircraft, Captain Al Qaood has not only validated her own mastery of complex flight technology but has also symbolically lifted her entire country onto a global stage, demonstrating Bahrain's commitment to nurturing pioneering female leadership in one of the most demanding professions on Earth.The skies have a new commander, and she hails from the Kingdom of Bahrain. Captain Fatima Nabeel Al Qaood has officially achieved the ultimate dream of commercial pilots: the prestigious rank of Captain. What makes this an extraordinary milestone is the aircraft she commands—the colossal Airbus A380. Captain Al Qaood is the first woman from Bahrain to reach this elite status while piloting the world’s largest commercial passenger jet.This achievement follows a rigorous and demanding journey.Reaching Captain status requires accumulating thousands of flight hours, passing complex technical examinations, and demonstrating flawless command ability—skills proven by Captain Al Qaood on one of the most sophisticated machines ever built.Captain Fatima Nabeel Al Qaood's historic ascent to the command seat of the Airbus A380 is a defining moment for Bahrain and the Arab world, marking a major triumph for women in professional aviation. As a proud Bahraini national, her achievement is uniquely significant because she is the first woman from the Kingdom to achieve the rank of Captain while piloting the colossal A380, the world's largest commercial aircraft. While other pioneering women, such as Captain Yasmeen Fraidoon, previously broke the barrier by becoming Bahrain's first female Captains on smaller fleet aircraft, Captain Al Qaood has taken that legacy to the ultimate level of complexity and scale.Her success is the culmination of years of rigorous, demanding technical training and thousands of hours flying in the sky, positioning her not merely as a remarkably skilled pilot, but as a global inspiring symbol of the ambitious, highly-trained female workforce that is steadily shattering traditional barriers throughout the modern Gulf region.To truly grasp the scale of Captain Al Qaood’s achievement, one must understand the significance of the Airbus A380, often nicknamed the ""Superjumbo."" It represents the pinnacle of commercial aviation engineering, and commanding it is a globally recognized feat of skill.The A380 is a double-decker giant that demands exceptional expertise:Unmatched Scale: It is the largest passenger plane in operation, weighing nearly 600 tonnes at takeoff and carrying over 500 passengers.Technical Mastery: Its complex systems require a Captain who possesses not only piloting skills but also superior crew resource management and emergency procedure expertise.The Elite Few: The number of pilots, particularly women, qualified to command this massive aircraft is incredibly small, placing Captain Al Qaood in an elite global cohort of aviators.Her position is a powerful testament to her technical precision and ability to lead a crew responsible for hundreds of lives.Captain Fatima Nabeel Al Qaood’s achievement is the latest in a line of groundbreaking firsts for Bahraini women in the air, showing a consistent national commitment to female empowerment in the aviation sector.First Captains: Captain Al Qaood follows in the footsteps of pioneers like Captain Yasmeen Fraidoon, who became Gulf Air's first female Bahraini Captain on the national carrier's fleet (Airbus A320s/A330s). Captain Al Qaood's achievement extends this legacy to the A380.Military Milestones: In 2018, Sheikha Aisha bint Rashid Al Khalifa made history as the Kingdom's first female fighter pilot, flying a BAE Hawk.Engineering Excellence: Pioneering women like Hend Al Awadhi were the first female aircraft engineers, ensuring the safety of the fleet from the ground up.Captain Al Qaood’s command of the A380 is a symbol that the glass ceiling for women in the Gulf is not just cracked—it’s been completely shattered at the cruising altitude of 43,000 feet.Captain Al Qaood’s success is a direct, visible call to action for young women across the Middle East. Her journey is proof that dedication, passion, and rigorous training open doors to the most challenging and rewarding careers, regardless of background.By taking the ultimate seat on the ultimate jet, she has provided a powerful narrative: the complex technical fields of science and aviation are fully accessible. Her legacy, flying the world’s largest commercial aircraft, serves as a beacon of possibility, ensuring that the future of aviation is increasingly diverse and female-led.",Captain fatima nabeel al qaood is the first woman from bahrain to reach this elite status while piloting the world’s largest commercial passenger jet.

Micheal Ray Richardson, the NBA legend suffered an unfortunate death which has left his fans mourning and shocked. While Micheal Ray Richardson had a short career in the NBA, fans are still in awe of his skills.Back in 1986, Micheal Ray Richardson was banned from the NBA for life after he ended up testing positive for cocaine for the third time in three seasons. While the NBA legend did get a chance to rejoin the league in 1988, he never returned.A year ago, he co-authored a memoir about his life called, ""Banned: How I squandered an All-Star NBA Career Before Finding a Redemption”, where he opened up about his addiction to drugs.In his memoir, Micheal Ray Richardson had opened up about meeting a man named Muhammad who had gotten him addicted to drugs.As per his memoir, Micheal Ray Richardson wrote, “Even though I got into some rough spots, I'm not a bad guy. You get blinders when you're an addict. You're there, looking through your eyes... but at the same time, you're not all there. Because of that, when I would get high, I wouldn't want to go out in public.”The 70 year old NBA legend also reiterated that he never sold drugs or drove his car while he was “smoking” it.A year back, Micheal Ray Richardson also spoke to The Guardian about drugs being used in the league today.He said, “Even now…it’s not like it was back in the 80s when I was [playing]. Because now there’s the fentanyl. Now what they’re doing is mixing all the drugs with fentanyl and it only takes a little – because fentanyl will kill you.”The NBA legend added, “One thing about alcohol and drugs…they do not discriminate.”After leaving the NBA in 1986 and refusing to return, Micheal Ray Richardson played in the Continental Basketball Association but finished his career in Europe.Later in his life, the NBA legend won five championships as a coach in the Continental Basketball Association and NBL Canada.According to The Associated Press, Micheal Ray Richardson died in his home in Lawton, Oklahoma in the presence of his wife, Kimberly.","Micheal ray richardson was banned from the nba for life in 1986 after testing positive for cocaine for the third time in three seasons.

Shaquille O’Neal and Adam Sandler’s shared love of basketball deepened the bond



Shaquille O’Neal has lived a life filled with championships, endorsements, and unforgettable NBA moments, but his leap into comedy films came from a place few expected. During the height of his career, the pressures of being a franchise cornerstone weighed on him. Games were high-stakes, his workload was massive, and the public scrutiny grew louder every season. To stay centered, O’Neal developed a simple ritual: he turned to comedies. Adam Sandler ’s films, in particular, became his escape. Those nights spent laughing not only eased stress but unknowingly laid the groundwork for one of the most unexpected NBA-to-Hollywood pipelines.O’Neal’s personality always extended beyond the court, but comedy gave him something different.It allowed him to detach from missed free throws, media noise, and playoff pressure. What started as a private coping mechanism evolved into a connection that would later lead him to movie sets, surrounded by the Happy Madison crew. His acting roles did not happen by accident. They were the byproduct of a long-running inside joke between him and one of Hollywood’s biggest comedians.Shaquille O’Neal opened up about the origins of the partnership on his Big Podcast, explaining how movies were part of his recovery routine during his NBA years.“Music and movies kept me out of the, ‘You missed 30 free throws etc. etc,’ I would spend 20 hours worrying about that, but I needed time to recharge. So I got to laugh. Only way to recharge is laugh or hear something I like,” he said. For him, humor wasn’t just entertainment. It was maintenance.That connection grew whenever Sandler sat courtside. O’Neal often found himself shouting playful requests after big plays. According to him, their banter eventually became a running challenge.“Adam Sandler, he’s still hot, but he was hot at the time. I’d always say, ‘Hey man, you got to put me in a movie.’ And he was smart. ‘Win me a championship big fella.’ He’d always say that. So then after the first championship, ‘Hey man put me in a movie.’ ‘Win another championship big fella.’ He would always say that.”Sandler kept the promise. After O’Neal retired, he received a call through a mutual friend that changed everything. “So then after I retired, my guy Danny called me and said, ‘Hey man. Adam Sandler said he would always tell you he would put you in his movies. He’s got four movies for you.’ So he put me in movies back-to-back,” O’Neal said. The result was a string of appearances in Jack & Jill, Grown Ups 2, Blended, and Hubie Halloween, all under Sandler’s Happy Madison banner.Sandler’s ties to basketball are well-known. From Uncut Gems to Hustle, the comedian has built much of his creative world around the sport. That connection made O’Neal an ideal addition to his projects. Years earlier, O’Neal told PopCulture.com about the original challenge: “Crazy thing about the Adam Sandler movies - he used to sit there with Jack Nicholson. I used to always, especially after I scored a bucket and the crowd goes crazy, I'd be like, 'Adam, give me a movie!' He would say, 'Win a championship first. ’”When Sandler eventually called, he reminded O’Neal of the deal. “He called me up one day and said, ‘Shaq, you got four championships, I owe you four movies.’”O’Neal may never anchor a dramatic Oscar contender, but he doesn’t need to. He has done his part well and lived his long-time dream.Also Read: Throwback: Did Shaquille O’Neal really get invited to ex-wife Shaunie Henderson’s second wedding?","Shaquille o’neal and adam sandler’s shared love of basketball deepened the bond between the two men.

Shubman Gill Press Conference: Team India captain opens up about India’s bowling plan for SA Test

KOLKATA: It is not often that a champion team starts off in a game as underdogs. When World Test champions South Africa take on India in the first Test of the two-match series at the Eden Gardens here from Friday, they will surely not be the favourites. That’s a tag reserved for India when they are playing at home, even if on a wicket that might provide more help to seamers than anywhere else in the country.“It’s a typical Indian wicket,” India skipper Shubman Gill said on Thursday, after checking the all-important rectangle for the millionth time over three days. “Today, it looked a bit different from how it was yesterday,” he added.Now, that’s interesting. These variations might just make the team combination pendulum oscillate between spin and pace. “It tends to swing in the morning and evening in Kolkata,” Gill said. Statistics say pacers picked 75 per cent of wickets in the last four Tests. So, Kuldeep or Akash Deep?But then, in India, spin dominates eventually. Maybe, play safe and go for Axar Patel and thus have an extra batter. After all, South Africa too have some dangerous weapons in their bowling armoury.“We’ll wait for another look tomorrow morning before deciding our playing XI,” Gill concluded.South Africa skipper Temba Bavuma would also wait for Friday before declaring his team. “Here in Kolkata, it swings a bit more than other parts of India, but then this is the subcontinent and you have to make sure that you have your resources from the spin point of view,” he said. “So, we’ll wait one more day.” India’s dilemma is quite understandable, given the debacle against New Zealand. Dishing out turners went against them as even a not-so-established spinner like Ajaz Patel ended up looking menacing. Sometimes, the demon you bank on can turn back and devour you. If Gill, Gautam Gambhir (head coach) and Sitanshu Kotak (batting coach) were repeatedly going back to check the pitch, holding discussions with the curators, they were perhaps trying to figure out if indeed there were any hidden demons.“No demons out there,” South Africa coach Shukri Conrad declared after inspecting the pitch. “Just a normal Eden Gardens wicket.” His bowlers did get some swing towards the fag end of an afternoon practice session. That would be around 4 pm, when the light starts fading. Reverse swing would be a major factor too, as Gill admitted. The team managements will have to keep all permutations in mind before settling down on their playing XI.Thursday’s net session was a lot about batting. Rishabh Pant had a lengthy session, both against pace and spin. So did Gill and KL Rahul. The skipper took Kuldeep and Axar, along with two local spinners for another net. Gambhir soon joined, speaking to Kuldeep and Axar separately. It might well be a toss-up between these two if the combination pendulum veers towards spin.South Africa too have their batting in place, the dependable Bavuma, fluent Ryan Rickleton, elegant Tony de Zorzi and gritty Aiden Markram all spent some quality time in the nets on Thursday. This batting lineup is way stronger than that of the West Indies, India’s last Test opponents, whom they dominated over two Tests. The only worry for Gill’s team in that series was that they allowed the second Test to go to Day 5. “It was a slow wicket (in Delhi) and our spinners were not getting the zip,” Gill said. In hindsight, he admitted enforcing the follow-on was unfair on the tired bowlers and might have stretched the game. Eden would be a lot faster, with zip for spinners and swing for pacers.Test matches always have battles within the war: Jasprit Bumrah vs Bavuma; Kagiso Rabada vs Gill; Mohammed Siraj vs Rickleton or maybe Keshav Maharaj vs Rahul. A lot of interesting battles could be played out there over the next five days, making it a lively contest.","South africa take on india in the first test of the two-match series at the eden gardens here from friday. “it’s a typical indian wicket,” india skipper shubman gill said on thursday, after checking the all-important rectangle over three days.

NEW DELHI: Kuldeep Yadav has requested the Indian cricket board ( BCCI ) to grant him leave for his wedding later this month. TOI understands he is waiting for approval from the board. He was forced to cancel his wedding function earlier in the year when the IPL finished later than the scheduled date due to cross-border tension between India and Pakistan.BCCI sources told TOI that Kuldeep has sought leave in the last week of Nov. There has been a debate over Kuldeep’s place in the playing XI with leftarm spinner Axar Patel fighting for the third spinner’s role in the two-Test series against South Africa starting in Kolkata on Friday.The second Test will be played in Guwahati from Nov 22. The first ODI against South Africa is in Ranchi on Nov 30.“Kuldeep’s wedding is planned for the last week of Nov. The team management will assess when they will need his services before granting him the exact number of leaves,” a BCCI source said.It will be interesting to see if Kuldeep finds a place in the XI if the pitches offer prodigious turn early in the match. He was dropped for the entire home Test season last year when India played on rank turners. He also didn’t get a Test in England this year. The team management had released him from the ODI squad in Australia to prepare for the South Africa Tests by playing for India ‘A’ against South Africa ‘A’ in Bengaluru last week. He managed just one wicket in that match. His inferior batting capabilities have come in the way of his selection as well.",Kuldeep yadav has requested the indian cricket board ( bcci ) to grant him leave for his wedding later this month.

Shubman Gill Press Conference: Team India captain opens up about India’s bowling plan for SA Test

KOLKATA: When you become a world champion, you are most likely to celebrate in the manner that Indian women’s captain Harmanpreet Kaur did after beating South Africa women to win the World Cup: With a couple of bhangra steps, slapping a handshake and then accepting the trophy. Not like Temba Bavuma . The South Africa captain remained ice cool in the centre of frenzied celebrations after they became the Test world champions, beating Australia at Lord’s in what was surely one of the biggest upsets of the decade. The enormity of the occasion took time to sink in.A few months down the line, that winning feeling has sunk in and most of South Africa’s cricketers have already moved on. “Yeah, I think it has sunk in. I think whenever we go into series, there’s a lot more of an expectation from us as a team to, I guess, uphold the whole champion status,” Bavuma said on Thursday. “It doesn’t really change anything from our point of view, but I think from a confidence point, it’s just a case of us kind of walking proudly.“We’re known as the champions, the current champions at this point. We have a lovely opportunity now coming up against India in their own conditions. Not many bigger challenges than that. So it is an opportunity for us to kind of stamp ourselves with that label.”The champions label doesn’t come cheap and Bavuma knows that their performance will be keenly followed from now on. Already, the drawn series against Pakistan has generated a lot of interest, particularly how their spinners performed.Back home, however, the celebrations continue even as Bavuma’s team is focusing on their job in the ongoing WTC cycle.“Back home, I do feel like there’s been a major shift in mindset towards cricket. There’s been a lot more appreciation. The love that’s been shown towards the team, also to individuals within the team... I think for myself personally, probably a lot more appreciation for my presence within the team. So I guess that’s something that’s been good.”Chokers to champions has been the South African story, although Bavuma doesn’t quite agree with that narrative. “I really don’t think that it was (chokers’ tag) something for this group of guys. Some of these guys weren’t even born when World Cups happened and where we didn’t get over the line. So it really is not for this team to kind of walk around with. I think for some of us, some older guys have been at ICC events and have come up short. You know, it probably brought a little bit of relief, but also stronger belief that if you keep going, if you keep pushing, things are about to happen. So, yeah, I think confidence is probably the biggest word back home. For us as a team, it’s about being confident that we can continue being the No.1 team.”",Temba bavuma says south africa's world cup win has'sunk in' south africa face india in their first test at the ageas bowl.
