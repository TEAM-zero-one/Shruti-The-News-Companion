Clare initially turned down Tommy Fleetwood before love story started

Clare Fleetwood ’s support during heartbreaking near-misses

Tommy Fleetwood is one of the top-paid golfers in the world as of August 2025. On the PGA Tour itself, he has won more than $31 million in prize money. This statistic makes him one of the biggest-money winners in the history of the DP World Tour, with a career earnings total of around $35 million.Other sources of income have also bolstered Fleetwood, but still has yet to nab a win on the PGA Tour. In addition, he has taken home sponsorship deals with Nike, TaylorMade, and TAG Heuer, benefitting from a significant amount of millions as a result of golf's former Player Impact Program.Fleetwood met his wife, Clare, in 2015, which further blended his personal and professional lives. Clare was then a sports management executive when she became Tommy's client. Their work was the beginning of what would soon become a deeper relationship, despite their 23-year age difference, and after the controversies from the media.Clare explained how she initially turned down Tommy when he first asked her out because the age gap made her feel cautious. But after further thought, she succumbed, and the couple entered a relationship that shocked the golf world.The pair had concerns about whether mixing business with romance would work, but agreed to give it six months to see how it went.So when they did, they were surprised to find that the two arrangements reinforced each other, professionally and personally. Clare, who maintains a cool and calm approach, has regularly been acknowledged as a reason Tommy stays composed and relaxed in stressful situations on the course.Apart from materialistic dividends, there have been some massive emotional ups and downs in Fleetwood’s professional career. Clare has remained his rock through his lowest lows, which include several painful near misses on the PGA Tour.None was more heartbreaking than the one he endured at the Travelers Championship as Tommy once again finished in second place, this time the victim of a late charge by Keegan Bradley to come up one stroke short of the winner. Enticing words like these have shaped his career narrative to date, so near, but not close enough to cement that first PGA Tour title.Going into the last 18 holes of the Tour Championship, Fleetwood was quoted as a fan's favourite, and Clare was back to have his back as always. Friends of the couple say Clare has been a great support to Tommy in dealing with the pressure, and his two losses have only made him more determined and focused towards the future.Also Read: Who is golfer Tommy Fleetwood’s wife Clare?

Blake Lively, Ryan Reynolds, and the godchildren who inspired Taylor Swift’s songs

Pop icon Taylor Swift may dominate the music charts and headlines for her relationship with Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce , but there’s another side to her that doesn’t often make the spotlight: her role as a godmother. Beyond the stadium appearances and sold-out tours, Swift plays a personal role in the lives of several celebrity children, showcasing the depth of her friendships and her influence beyond music.Taylor Swift’s first widely known godchild is Leo Thames King, son of actress Jaime King. Born in 2015, Leo quickly became a part of Swift’s inner circle, with the singer even penning emotional words inspired by the moment.When she first met him, Swift posted a touching photo with the caption, “Meeting my boy.” Jaime King, once a core member of Swift’s famous “squad,” has often spoken highly of her friend, calling her a “beautiful human being.” For King, naming Swift as godmother was “a really sacred thing,” signaling not just a celebrity connection but a genuine trust in the singer’s character.The most notable godparent role Swift holds is with the children of Hollywood power couple Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds.She is godmother to James, Inez, Betty, and Olin — a fact Swift humorously acknowledged while promoting Deadpool & Wolverine, writing, “Shout out to Wade Wilson, aka my godkids’ sperm donor.” Ryan Reynolds later clarified, “Swift is the godparent to my daughters.”Interestingly, the names James, Inez, and Betty are immortalized in Swift’s Folklore album, making her godmother role not just private but also creatively celebrated.Also Read: “She doesn’t include Blake”: Taylor Swift leans on Travis Kelce’s support and no longer values Blake Lively’s advice With five godchildren, Swift’s personal influence in Hollywood runs as deep as her professional success. And as her relationship with Travis Kelce continues to capture public imagination, her nurturing, family-centered side only reinforces why she remains one of the most admired figures in entertainment — both on and off the stage.Months after wrapping up her high-grossing Era Tour, Taylor Swift announced her twelfth album, The Life of a Showgirl. Instead of announcing the album at an award show like she did with Midnights and The Tortured Poets Department, Swift decided to announce it on her boyfriend, Travis Kelce, and his brother Jason Kelce’s New Heights podcast on August 12, 2025.The Life of a Showgirl looks like it’s going to have nine lives and then some, when it comes to variant editions with different album cover images and vinyl color schemes.","Taylor swift's first widely known godchild is leo thames king, son of actress jaime king.

The final drive with Walter Gretzky that meant more than the farewell ovation

Lessons from Walter Gretzky that shaped a hockey icon

Wayne Gretzky’s last NHL appearance on April 18, 1999, at Madison Square Garden is remembered as a celebration of the “Great One’s” extraordinary career. Yet, for Gretzky, the moment wasn’t only about the sold-out crowd, the ovations, or the history—it was about a quiet car ride with his father, Walter Gretzky.On the 25th anniversary of his retirement, Wayne Gretzky reflected on why he asked Walter to drive him to Madison Square Garden that night. “For my final game, I decided that since my dad drove me to the first game I ever went to, it would be great to drive my dad to my last game,” he told NHL.com.That ride, however, was far from ordinary. Gretzky admitted, “The ride was good, but it was kind of awful in the same sense because every three minutes, he kept hitting my leg and telling me that I could play one more year. I said, ‘No, dad, I’m done.’”While the NHL and fans worldwide treated the day as a fitting farewell to the greatest player in hockey history, Gretzky cherished that personal moment most. To him, it was the perfect full-circle memory, blending his first steps in hockey with the end of his iconic journey.Walter Gretzky was more than just a supportive parent—he was the guiding force behind Wayne’s rise. When officials tried to block young Wayne from moving to Toronto in 1974, Walter stood firm, saying, “No, they can't tell me where to send my own boy… If he will be happy elsewhere, we decide between the family.”Also Read: What is the Wayne Gretzky Rule and how it changed the modern NHL forever Walter’s philosophy of family first left a lifelong mark on Wayne, who carried those values into his career and personal life.

Kansas City Chiefs’ 53-man roster: Robert Tonyan, Gardner Minshew among notables

Trades, waivers, and surprise cuts: Eagles, Bears, Cowboys make key moves

NFL teams are racing against the clock to finalize their 53-man rosters ahead of Tuesday’s 4 p.m. ET deadline. With the preseason officially wrapped, teams like the Kansas City Chiefs, Philadelphia Eagles, and Chicago Bears have already started making major moves, trades, waivers, and tough releases, as they trim down from 90 players.Rosters must be reduced to 53 by Aug. 26, with practice squads to follow by Wednesday. Players with fewer than four accrued seasons will be subject to the waiver wire, while veterans are released outright and hit free agency. Teams can also use tools like injured reserve, reserve/PUP, and NFI lists to meet cut requirements without outright dropping players.Here’s what you need to know about key cuts, trades, and projected rosters from the NFL’s biggest names before the transaction window closes.Kansas City is expected to field one of the most stable rosters in the league, but even so, familiar names could be on the outside looking in. The Chiefs will likely carry two quarterbacks: Patrick Mahomes and Gardner Minshew, with Chris Oladokun set for the practice squad.Running back Isiah Pacheco is healthy and back in RB1 shape, while rookie Brashard Smith earned first-team snaps in the preseason finale and could leapfrog into a secure role.Veterans like Elijah Mitchell may not survive the cut.Among wide receivers, Rashee Rice, Hollywood Brown, and rookie Xavier Worthy headline a crowded group. JuJu Smith-Schuster and Tyquan Thornton are projected to stick, while Jalen Royals and Nikko Remigio are battling injuries and special teams roles.Tight end Robert Tonyan led the team in preseason receiving yards (90), making a strong case for a roster spot behind Travis Kelce and Noah Gray. Jared Wiley may hit injured reserve, depending on his knee recovery.On defense, Chris Jones anchors the interior line, with veteran Derrick Nnadi rejoining the team after a short stint with the Jets. Felix Anudike-Uzomah, a first-round pick in 2023, is out for the year with a hamstring injury, opening space for Malik Herring or a potential waiver addition.Linebacker Cooper McDonald, a rookie tryout, has pushed into contention after impressing in camp. In the secondary, the absence of Joshua Williams from key reps suggests he could be cut, while Chris Roland-Wallace and Nazeeh Johnson look secure.The Philadelphia Eagles made headlines on Sunday by completing three trades, starting with acquiring quarterback Sam Howell from the Minnesota Vikings. As per ESPN’s Adam Schefter, the Eagles also sent Darian Kinnard to Green Bay and brought back offensive tackle Fred Johnson from Jacksonville.In Cleveland, Shedeur Sanders remains buried on the depth chart and has seen four offensive linemen from his unit waived, including Javion Cohen and Sebastian Gutierrez, as per the Browns' official website.Shilo Sanders was waived by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers following an ejection for punching Bills tight end Zach Davidson in a preseason matchup. The altercation likely sealed his fate, despite flashes of promise earlier in camp.The Chicago Bears are also deep into cut territory. Offensive lineman Kiran Amegadjie, a former third-round pick, appears to have been leapfrogged on the depth chart by rookie Theo Benedet. Running backs Brittain Brown and Ian Wheeler were productive in the preseason but are expected to miss the 53 due to depth and special teams priorities.Wide receiver Maurice Alexander showed solid preseason numbers but may be edged out by undrafted rookie Jahdae Walker. Veteran Devin Duvernay is expected to secure a roster spot as a return specialist.In New England, pass-rusher Anfernee Jennings is viewed as a likely trade candidate. As per ESPN’s Bill Barnwell, “Jennings is a stout run defender on the edge… I like him as a fit in Detroit.” The Patriots have already cut 15 players, including Micah Bernard, Monty Rice, Jaheim Bell, and Sidy Sow.The Jacksonville Jaguars, currently fifth in waiver priority, traded Fred Johnson to Philadelphia and now hold 12 picks in the 2026 NFL Draft. Rookie Wyatt Milum and swing tackle Cole Van Lanen remain injury questions heading into final cuts.","Nfl teams are racing against the clock to finalize their 53-man rosters ahead of tuesday’s 4 p.m. Et deadline.

NFL fans show support for Ben DiNucci after his hilarious airport beer post about 7 cuts

Ben DiNucci’s rollercoaster NFL career

Life in the NFL isn’t always Super Bowls and champagne. For some players, it’s fighting for a roster spot year after year. That’s been the case for quarterback Ben DiNucci, who has now been released by NFL teams seven different times. Instead of sulking, DiNucci turned the moment into a viral one, raising a glass of beer at an airport and posting about it. The internet, surprisingly, loved every second of it.After his latest release by the Atlanta Falcons, Ben DiNucci didn’t post a long statement or a sad goodbye. Instead, he kept it short and humorous, calling it an “airport beer” kind of day. That simple line, paired with a photo of him with a drink, exploded online. For fans, it was refreshing to see an athlete handle such a tough setback with humor instead of heartbreak.Once the post hit X (formerly Twitter), fans rallied around Ben DiNucci with the perfect mix of jokes and genuine support. Some praised his resilience, saying being cut seven times is still proof of a long NFL career. Others joked about how relatable an “airport beer” feels when life knocks you down. One fan even flipped it into motivation, saying,Ben DiNucci’s story has always been about persistence. Drafted by the Dallas Cowboys in 2020, he went from backup to starting quarterback in just his first season, even posting a 1–0 record in his lone start.Since then, he’s bounced around the league with stops at the Denver Broncos, Buffalo Bills, New Orleans Saints, and most recently, the Atlanta Falcons.Across his career, Ben DiNucci has started 3 games and thrown for 219 yards. While he’s never been a franchise quarterback, he’s built a reputation as a reliable backup with veteran leadership. And now, after his seventh cut, his viral “airport beer” post shows exactly why fans keep rooting for him—because he’s handling the chaos with honesty, humor, and grit.Seven cuts later, Ben DiNucci isn’t giving up. Whether he gets that elusive eighth chance in the NFL or not, his viral beer post reminded fans of why they still pull for him. In a league where careers end overnight, Ben DiNucci has turned survival into its own victory. And judging by the internet’s reaction, he’s still very much a fan favorite.Also read - Ed Kelce spills why Kansas City Chiefs star Travis Kelce is so happy","Ben dinucci has been released by seven different nfl teams.

Anthony Edwards China tour marks a new chapter in his off court success story

Minnesota Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards isn't one to hold back on making bold claims, and his recent statement during a promotional tour in China has basketball fans talking. The 24-year-old guard went on social media to confidently say that he would dunk on Chinese basketball icon Yao Ming, the 7-foot-6 Hall of Famer who ruled the NBA with the Houston Rockets from 2002 to 2011.The statement was posted directly by Edwards on Instagram Threads, where he shared a picture of his meeting with Yao and captioned it, ""I wud dunk on Yao shout out to one of da greats."".This isn't the first time Edwards has shown off his bold confidence in his dunking skills. In a past Instagram reel, when someone asked him if he ever felt guilty about dunking on his opponents, Edwards confidently responded, ""H*** no,"" before adding, ""I wish I could dunk on every f***ing body. I wanna dunk on everybody, I swear to God.""This unfiltered sentiment was expressed in a laid-back video clip, showcasing his attitude that goes beyond just regular trash talk—it's a real urge to take on and dominate anyone who stands in his way.In a similar vein, during Netflix's documentary series 'Starting 5,' Edwards opened up about his mixed emotions regarding dunking, stating, ""I don’t like to dunk at all, to be honest. Because it hurts,"" but he quickly clarified his exception: ""I like to dunk on people.""These quotes, delivered in interviews and social media, paint a picture of a player who thrives on the thrill of humiliating defenders, even if it comes with physical discomfort.Beyond all the talk about dunks, this tour has been a major milestone in Edwards' expanding career beyond basketball. After being selected first overall by the Timberwolves in 2020, Edwards has evolved from a promising rookie into a three-time All-Star and an essential leader, guiding Minnesota to consecutive appearances in the Western Conference Finals. His rapid ascent has also earned him a signature shoe deal with Adidas , which is a huge opportunity for young athletes.The AE 1, his very first model, became a huge hit, and on the second day of the China tour, Edwards unveiled the AE 2 in the ""With Love"" colorway. This sneaker features sleek synthetic overlays, breathable patterned mesh, and a design that combines streetwear aesthetics with high-performance functionality.During the launch event, Eric Wise, who is the global general manager of Adidas Basketball, gave high praise to Edwards, saying, ""We know what his ceiling is. It’s pretty high, if there is one… He’s skyrocketing. He feels like a part of us.Also Read: “I’ve never looked at Klay Thompson as a role player” — Patrick Beverley explains why Paul George fits the Golden State Warriors better It doesn’t feel like a different athlete from a different brand.""

Injury Report to Watch for Tonight’s New York Liberty vs Connecticut Sun Game (August 25, 2025)

Theare heavy favorites heading into their Monday night matchup against theat Barclays Center, with sportsbooks listing them as 12 to 15-point favorites. The Liberty’s moneyline sits at -1350, while the Sun are big underdogs at +880. The total is set around 166 points. Projections lean toward a Liberty victory, with simulations giving them close to a 79 - 90% chance of winning and an expected score near 90-76.You can consider the following for tonight’s New York Liberty vs Connecticut Sun game:• Breanna Stewart Under 14.5 Points (injury concerns and defensive attention could keep her below this mark, -102 odds)• Marina Mabrey Over 2.5 Threes (a key perimeter option for the Sun, +140 value)• Jonquel Jones Over 16 Points & 10 Rebounds (interior mismatch in Liberty’s favor)New York (22-15) remains a top-five team in the WNBA despite dropping their last two games. Led by Sabrina Ionescu, Breanna Stewart, and Jonquel Jones, they’re averaging 85.8 points per game on 45.3% shooting and giving up just 81.6. Playing at home in Brooklyn only strengthens their edge.Connecticut sits at 9-27, but they’ve shown life with a three-game winning streak. Tina Charles has been a steady presence at 16.3 points and 6.0 rebounds per game, while Bria Hartley’s 23-point outburst in the last matchup provided offensive punch.Still, the Sun average just 75.7 points per game and surrender 85.3, making them vulnerable against elite opponents. Hence, in tonight’s New York Liberty vs Connecticut Sun, the latter are considered long shots.The Liberty have dominated recent matchups, winning eight of the last ten, including an 87-78 victory at Mohegan Sun Arena earlier this month. Returning home, they’ll look to continue their control over Connecticut.The Liberty’s depth could be tested with Sabrina Ionescu , Natasha Cloud, and Breanna Stewart all questionable. Nyara Sabally is out. For Connecticut, Rayah Marshall won’t play (personal reasons), and Leila Lacan is doubtful with an eye injury. These absences may open up betting opportunities in the player prop market.The New York Liberty vs Connecticut Sun matchup heavily tilts toward the Liberty, who should win comfortably if their stars are available. The Sun may keep it competitive with recent momentum, but New York’s talent, depth, and home-court advantage make them the safe bet. Bettors should look to Liberty covering the spread and key props involving Stewart, Jones, and Mabrey for value.","New york liberty (22-15) remains a top-five team in the wnba despite dropping their last two games.
