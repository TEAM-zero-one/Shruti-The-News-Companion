Just weeks after finishing a difficult first college football season at the University of North Carolina, the 73-year-old coaching legend has landed a new role with ESPN. The network confirmed that Bill Belichick will appear on the ACC Network’s broadcast of the College Football Playoff national championship game, set to be played in South Florida at Hard Rock Stadium.The game will feature the Indiana Hoosiers against the University of Miami Hurricanes and is scheduled for a 7:30 p.m. kickoff.

He appeared on “Monday Night Football’s ManningCast” with Peyton Manning and Eli Manning and also made regular appearances on The Pat McAfee Show.Now, Bill Belichick is mixing both worlds. He is still leading North Carolina’s rebuild, but he is also stepping back into the media spotlight.ESPN’s announcement said the move brings “one of football’s greatest minds” back to the broadcast booth.Bill Belichick is the only head coach in NFL history to win six Super Bowls with one team. He also won two more Super Bowls as a defensive coordinator with the New York Giants.While returning to television, Bill Belichick has stayed busy on the recruiting trail. One of his biggest recent moves was bringing in quarterback Billy Edwards Jr. to Chapel Hill.ESPN’s Pete Thamel reported that Edwards chose North Carolina after being granted a medical redshirt, giving him one more year of college eligibility.Billy Edwards Jr., a Virginia native, transferred to Wisconsin in August 2025 after playing at Maryland.He later suffered a knee injury and missed the rest of the season. Now, he will compete with Gio Lopez for the Tar Heels’ starting job.He will also work under Belichick and new offensive coordinator Bobby Petrino, another longtime NFL coach.The addition matters for a North Carolina team that struggled badly. The Tar Heels beat only two Power Four teams, Syracuse and Stanford, during the 2025 season.Off the field, Bill Belichick has also faced attention around his personal life, including heavy media focus on his relationship with Jordon Hudson.Despite the noise, sources around the program say Belichick has stayed locked in on recruiting and player development.North Carolina will next hold its spring game on April 12 at Kenan Stadium, where fans will get their first look at the new roster.","Bill belichick will appear on the acc network’s broadcast of the college football playoff national championship game.

Minnesota Wild controls early stages of play to withstand Maple Leafs' push



Marcus Foligno Notches First Career Hat Trick vs. Maple Leafs

Marcus Foligno gave a historic performance on Monday night, with his first career hat trick to lead the Minnesota Wild in beating the Toronto Maple Leafs 6-3 on the road. He completed his hat trick with an empty-net goal in the third period, breaking the home-winning streak of the Toronto Maple Leafs.The Minnesota Wild had the game in hand, going up by four before fending off their best effort in the third period. Their balanced attack, strong power play, and disciplined defensive systems overwhelmed the Maple Leafs, who opened a five-game homestand hoping to shake off an iffy road trip.The Minnesota Wild made little wait to set the tempo, burying a power play goal midway through the first period. Vladimir Tarasenko scored from a cross-crease pass to put Toronto on its heels and opened a multi-goal hole that Minnesota made no effort to fill, scoring again from the crease through Ryan Hartman to give it an early 2-0 edge.The Toronto Maple Leafs finally capitalized towards the end of the first period as John Tavares completed a power-play opportunity from the slot, reducing the gap by half and momentarily steadying the momentum. This surge was, however, short-lived for Toronto as Minnesota soon regained momentum in the early portion of the second frame. Foligno redirected a point shot, restoring the two-goal margin, paying homage to the Wild for their efforts in parking the presence in front of the crease and crowding the middle ice.The pace quickly escalated as Tarasenko dished past the defense and wristed the puck past Joseph Woll, giving the Blues a 4-1 lead. The Wild continued to apply pressure to the Toronto defense, and Foligno scored once more with the main advantage late in the second period, tipping the puck past the defense from the point to give the Wild a commanding lead going into the third period.Foligno sealed any hopes of a comeback attempt with an empty-net goal, finishing his hat trick in his 915th game in the NHL. This is a career milestone for the player, having only achieved 12 instances of scoring two goals in a game before this.","Marcus foligno scored his first career hat trick to lead the minnesota wild in beating the toronto maple leafs 6-3 on the road.

Three road trips that could shape the Toronto Blue Jays’ 2026 campaign,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/three-road-trips-that-could-shape-the-toronto-blue-jays-2026-campaign/articleshow/126836334.cms,"Vladimir Guerrero Jr. (Image Source: Getty)

High expectations and a season on the line

Chicago White Sox (April 2–5)

New York Yankees (May 18–21)

Seattle Mariners (July 3–5)

Why these road trips matter for Blue Jays

The Toronto Blue Jays have a lot of expectations regarding the 2026 season of the MLB, as they were beaten by only slight margins in the World Series last year. As the roster was reinforced by newcomers and the team was once again on the quest to win the championship, a number of road trips can be viewed as possible turning points. The depth, the strength, and the consistency of a team are usually put to the test when they are away, and these three series may prove to be conclusive in the season of Toronto.The first major road test by Toronto is against the Chicago white Sox, early. Although Chicago cannot be regarded as a powerhouse, the early-season games can precondition the months. An impressive performance in this series would enable the Blue Jays to gain confidence and momentum during the transition between Spring Training and the regular season grind. It also offers a competitive environment where the new players get a chance to bond outside of the home.There is no other rivalry in baseball that can be compared to the level of Blue Jays vs Yankees, and this Bronx series might have significant consequences on the American League East ranking. New York is among the most challenging divisional rivals of Toronto, and it is never easy to win on the ground in Yankee Stadium.This series will probably put Toronto to the test with the pitching strength, the lineup composition, and the psychological strength.It is a West Coast road trip to Seattle, which comes at a critical junction of the season. The Mariners have a good home track record and a competitive team, and this is not the place any other team wants to work. In the case of Toronto, this series may spell the difference between the club continuing momentum into the second half, or it may get tired and be weighed down by travel.As a group, these three road trips offer a combination of early-season foundation building, pressure-induced rivalry, and endurance-induced pressure in the middle of the first half. The Blue Jays' performance in Chicago, New York, and Seattle may play a major role in their path in the 2026 season.Being able to be consistent on the road has always been a characteristic of the championship teams, and the fact that Toronto overcame such obstacles might actually be what determines whether they will go back to the World Series with business to finish or another season of close calls.","The toronto blue jays have a lot of expectations regarding the 2026 season of the mlb.

Nathan Aspinall opens up about being sun-soaked ahead of Saudi Darts Masters quarter-final



Nathan Aspinall has admitted that he pushed himself a little too hard off the oche while preparing for the Saudi Darts Masters. The English darts star has been competing in the Middle East and arrived in Riyadh after a strong showing at the Bahrain Darts Masters. There, Aspinall reached the semi-finals before losing 7-4 to Gian van Veen. Despite the loss, his form has remained sharp.The 34-year-old returned to action in Saudi Arabia on Tuesday night and produced an impressive performance. Aspinall defeated Lourence Ilagan 6-1 in the first round, recording an average of 100.93. While his darts were on fire, the conditions off the stage were just as intense, with hot weather playing its part in his preparation.After his dominant win over Ilagan, Nathan Aspinall joked that the weather had been just as challenging as his opponent. He explained that temperatures were around 25 degrees and that he had not played competitively since Bahrain. After arriving in Saudi Arabia on Sunday, he spent time relaxing by the pool instead of practicing.Aspinall said the sunny conditions were enjoyable but admitted he stayed out too long.He shared that his skin showed clear signs of spending too much time in the sun. According to him, this was his first visit to Saudi Arabia, and he fully embraced the warm weather, perhaps a bit too much.The Stockport-based player went on to admit that this is something he often does. He explained that whenever he goes on holiday, he tends to overdo it on the very first day. He said he ended up feeling extremely hot and sunburnt, even joking that he had given himself mild sunstroke. Despite that, he added that he planned to be back by the pool again the following day.On the sporting side, Aspinall now turns his attention to the quarter-finals. He will face Man Lok Leung, who caused a surprise by beating Danny Noppert 6-3. It will be a tough test, but Aspinall’s recent form suggests he is ready.There is also plenty at stake. The winner of the quarter-final match is guaranteed at least $10,000 for reaching the semi-finals. The player who loses will still earn $5,000 for making the last eight. The overall winner of the Saudi Darts Masters will take home a top prize of $30,000, adding extra motivation for Aspinall as he continues his run in Riyadh.",Nathan aspinall is in saudi arabia for the saudi darts masters.

NEW DELHI: A video claiming that the Indore crowd shouted “ Gautam Gambhir haaye haaye” after the third ODI against New Zealand has gone viral on social media, but the claim is misleading. The clip shows Virat Kohli reacting during the post-match presentation at the Holkar Stadium, and many users linked his reaction to alleged chants against head coach Gautam Gambhir.After India lost the match and the series 2-1, the video was widely shared on X and Instagram.Some fans said the chants showed anger towards the team management after recent home series losses, while others read different meanings into Kohli’s body language.However, a fact check suggests the crowd did not target Gambhir in Indore.Journalists and media personnel present at the stadium have said they did not hear any such chants during the ceremony. While the video visuals are real and were shot in Indore, the audio does not appear to be genuine.The sound in the clip seems to be taken from an older incident in Guwahati, where similar chants were heard during a Test match last year.The same audio pattern matches that earlier event, indicating the video was edited.This is important because misleading videos can create unnecessary controversy, especially when the team is already under pressure.Based on available information, the viral clip should not be seen as proof that the Indore crowd shouted slogans against Gautam Gambhir.With the 2-1 result, the Black Caps won an ODI series in India for the first time in 37 years, following their 3-0 Test series whitewash against India last year.India, however, have little time to dwell on the setback. The focus shifts to the shortest format, with a five-match T20I series against New Zealand starting Wednesday as part of the final build-up to the T20 World Cup. With less than three weeks remaining, the series serves as a vital dress rehearsal.The spotlight will be on captain Suryakumar Yadav.

Shubman Gill on missed chances, fielding lapses & World Cup preparation after ODI series loss

NEW DELHI: Virat Kohli ’s bat once again became the loudest response after India lost the three-match ODI series against New Zealand 1-2, with the former captain’s elder brother Vikas Kohli taking a pointed swipe at critics questioning the great’s choices late in his career.India went down by 41 runs in the series decider in Indore, but Kohli stood tall amid the collapse, producing a sublime 124 while chasing a daunting 338. Across the three matches, the 37-year-old amassed 240 runs at an average of 80, with scores of 93, 23 and 124, underlining his enduring dominance in the format.The knock came days after former India batter and commentator Sanjay Manjrekar questioned Kohli’s decision to retire from Test cricket and continue in what he described as the “easy” format of ODIs. The remark, made during the fifth Ashes Test in Sydney where Joe Root and Steve Smith struck centuries, drew widespread criticism from fans.Vikas Kohli joined the chorus on Sunday, soon after Virat registered his 54th ODI hundred and 85th international ton. In a post on Threads that has since gone viral, he aimed a sharp barb at Manjrekar. “I wonder if Mr Expert of cricket has some suggestions for the easiest form of cricket.You need to be there to do that. Anyways, as I said, Easier said than done,” he wrote.The numbers back the sentiment. In Kohli’s last six ODIs, he has scored three centuries and two half-centuries. He also struck a hundred and a fifty for Delhi in the Vijay Hazare Trophy, silencing doubts about his motivation after stepping away from Tests.Kohli will next feature in India colours in July 2026 during the England ODI tour. Before that, he will turn his focus to IPL 2026, aiming to help Royal Challengers Bengaluru defend their title.","India lost the three-match odi series against new zealand 1-2.

Most hundreds vs NZ (ODIs)

NEW DELHI: Run-machine Virat Kohli once again proved why he remains the heartbeat of India’s ODI batting, producing a majestic century against New Zealand in the third and final match of the series on Sunday. In a chase that looked to be slipping away early, Kohli stood tall, registering his record-extending 54th ODI hundred - 85th overall in international cricket, and keeping India’s hopes alive deep into the innings.This knock also carried historic significance. Kohli, who finished the match with 12,662 runs batting at number three in ODIs, has now gone past Australian great Ricky Ponting ’s tally of 12,655 to become the highest run-scorer in the format at that crucial position.7 - Virat Kohli (36 inns)*6 - Ricky Ponting (50 inns)6 - Virender Sehwag (23 inns)5 - Sachin Tendulkar (41 inns)5 - Sanath Jayasuriya (45 inns)Kohli also climbed to the top of another elite list. He now has the most ODI hundreds against New Zealand, with seven centuries in just 36 innings. Only Ricky Ponting and Virender Sehwag come close, with six each, while legends Sachin Tendulkar and Sanath Jayasuriya finished with five apiece.The century came at a critical moment. India were reeling at 71 for four after New Zealand posted a daunting 337 for eight. On a wicket that demanded composure, Kohli opted for control and persistence. He brought up his hundred with a single off Zak Foulkes on the final ball of the 40th over, having struck eight fours and two sixes in a 91-ball innings.It marked a landmark across formats and conditions. This was Kohli’s 85th international century, his 54th in ODIs, his 41st on Indian soil, and his seventh against New Zealand. He now has seven or more ODI hundreds against five different opponents, with 10 against Sri Lanka, nine against West Indies, eight against Australia, and seven each against South Africa and New Zealand.After missing out on a hundred in the series opener at Vadodara, where he fell for 93, Kohli made sure there was no repeat. He held one end firmly and built partnerships that dragged India back into the contest.The revival began with Nitish Kumar Reddy, who scored 53. Their 88-run stand for the fifth wicket restored belief before Kohli accelerated further alongside Harshit Rana. The pair added 99 runs in just 69 balls, with Rana contributing a fluent 52 off 43 deliveries.As long as Kohli remained at the crease, the sense persisted that another miracle was still possible. He eventually fell for a valiant 124 off 108 balls, a moment that effectively ended India’s chase. Until then, though, he had ensured belief never faded.The result may not have gone India’s way, but Kohli’s innings stood out as a reminder of his enduring greatness and his unmatched ability to make the impossible feel within reach.","Virat kohli scores 54th odi hundred and 85th in international cricket.

Saina Nehwal - The Queen of Indian Badminton | House of Glory | Episode 4

NEW DELHI: India's star shuttler Saina Nehwal has confirmed her retirement from competitive badminton as she revealed on Monday that a chronic knee condition had left her unable to cope with the physical demands of the elite sport.The 2012 London Olympic bronze medallist last appeared in a competition at the Singapore Open in 2023, though she chose not to formally announce her decision at the time.Explaining her decision, Saina said on a podcast, “I had stopped playing two years back. I actually felt that I entered the sport on my own terms and left on my own terms, so there was no need to announce it.”She added, “If you are not capable of playing anymore, that’s it. It’s fine.”The former world No. 1 said her decision was driven by severe knee degeneration that made sustained training impossible.Detailing the medical reality, she explained, ""Your cartiledge has totally degenerated, you have arthritis, that's what my parents needed to know that, my coaches needed to know that, and I just told them, 'Now probably I can't do it anymore, it is difficult'.""""Slowly people will also realise that Saina is not playing,"" she added.“I didn’t think it was such a big matter to announce my retirement. I just felt my time was up because I couldn’t push much, that my knee is not able to push like before.""Highlighting the contrast with her peak years, Saina noted, ""You train eight to nine hours to be the best in the world, now my knee was giving up in one or two hours. It was swelling and it became very tough to push after that. So I thought it’s enough. I can’t push it anymore.”Her career was significantly affected by a knee injury sustained at the Rio 2016 Olympics.While she mounted a strong comeback with a World Championships bronze in 2017 and Commonwealth Games gold in 2018, recurring issues persisted.In 2024, she revealed she has arthritis and worn cartilage in her knees.",India's star shuttler saina nehwal has confirmed her retirement from competitive badminton.

Raja was on the ground with the two captains, hosting the toss as part of the broadcast team. As he often does, the 63-year-old turned towards the stands and asked the fans to “make some noise”.But instead of loud cheers, there was almost complete silence in the stadium. Only a few faint claps and shouts were heard on television. For a brief moment, Raja looked surprised by the lack of response. He quickly collected himself and continued with the toss and the captain interviews.The short clip was soon shared widely on social media platforms like Instagram and X.Many users found the moment awkward and joked about it, as some labelled it as “cringe-worthy”. The video spread fast and became a popular topic among cricket fans around the world.Watch:Some fans defended him and said the situation may not have been his fault.They pointed out that stadium microphones often fail to capture crowd noise properly.Others said the toss usually happens when many fans are still entering the ground, so the stands are not always full or loud.

Poll Is it time for India to explore new talents in ODIs over seniors? Yes, fresh blood is needed. No, experience matters. A mix of both would be ideal. It depends on performance.

INDORE: India’s maiden ODI home series defeat to New Zealand here at the Holkar Stadium saw Virat Kohli, who smashed 124 off 108 balls in the last match, come out with flying colours. However, two other ageing modern-day greats are firmly under the scanner. Ravindra Jadeja and Rohit Sharma had a poor series, which doesn’t help with younger options snapping at their heels.The 37-year-old Jadeja went wicketless. In fact, in his last five ODIs, the Saurashtra allrounder has only managed to take one wicket. Jadeja’s leftarm spin, which once both stopped the run flow and provided crucial breakthroughs, seems to have lost its bite. Remember, T20I vice-captain Axar Patel , a like-for-like replacement, is waiting in the wings.Sreevats Goswami, who shared the dressing room with Jadeja in the 2008 U-19 World Cup that India won under Virat Kohli’s leadership, even posted on social media that the third ODI against New Zealand may well have been Jadeja’s last in the 50-over format. “We should celebrate him before he silently exits, because India play their next ODI only in June against England in England,” Goswami posted.Apart from his bowling, Jadeja has failed to make any significant contribution with the bat as well.Jadeja and fellow spinner Kuldeep Yadav’s inability to grab wickets in the middleovers was one of the key reasons for India being vanquished 2-1 by the Black Caps.Meanwhile, the debate around whether Rohit would play in the 2027 ODI World Cup was supposed to have ended after he put together a series of good scores against Australia (away) and then South Africa (home). That run included a match-winning century (121*) against Australia in Sydney, apart from three fifties. One even got to see a slimmed-down version of Rohit, indicating that he had worked a lot on his fitness.The 38-year-old’s decision to continue in ODIs has meant that left-hander Yashavi Jaiswal, who scored his maiden ODI century in the third ODI against South Africa in Vizag last Dec, has had to cool his heels in the dugout.Rohit will turn 39 on April 30 and is he motivated enough to keep playing only one format in international cricket?However, captain Shubman Gill defended his opening partner, saying, “Rohit is in terrific form, right through from the Australia to the South Africa series. You won’t always be able to convert the starts that you get.”","Ravindra jadeja and rohit sharma had a poor series, which doesn't help with younger options snapping at their heels.

Poll How do you feel about the removal of the Grade A+ category affecting players like Kohli and Rohit? It's unfair to senior players. It's a reasonable adjustment. I have mixed feelings about it. I support the change.

NEW DELHI: The Board of Control for Cricket in India ( BCCI ) is set to make a major overhaul in its Annual Central Contracts system, with sweeping changes that could significantly reshape the hierarchy of Indian cricket’s elite players. As per an ANI report citing sources within the BCCI, the selection committee has proposed doing away with the prestigious Grade A+ category altogether, a move that would directly impact senior stalwarts Virat Kohli and Rohit Sharma.The proposal, put forward by the Ajit Agarkar-led selection committee, recommends restructuring the contracts into just three categories — A, B and C — instead of the current four-tier system. As per sources familiar with the discussions, the A+ category, which currently carries an annual retainer of Rs 7 crore, is likely to be scrapped if the model receives approval from the BCCI’s apex council.“If the new structure is cleared, players will be grouped based on current format involvement rather than stature or legacy,” a BCCI official was quoted by ANI on condition of anonymity. Under the proposed framework, Kohli and Rohit — who are now active only in ODIs — are expected to be placed in Grade B, which currently carries a retainer of Rs 3 crore.The apex council is expected to deliberate on the proposal in its next meeting, where clarity will also emerge on whether the monetary slabs will be revised along with the structural changes. “Nothing is final yet, but there is a clear intent to align contracts with workload, formats played and future planning,” another senior BCCI source added.The existing 2024-25 central contracts list, announced in April 2025, featured Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ravindra Jadeja and Jasprit Bumrah in Grade A+. Grade A included Mohammed Siraj, KL Rahul, Shubman Gill, Hardik Pandya , Mohammed Shami and Rishabh Pant, while Grade B housed players such as Suryakumar Yadav, Axar Patel, Kuldeep Yadav, Yashasvi Jaiswal and Shreyas Iyer. A large pool of emerging players were placed in Grade C.Central contracts are annual retainers paid in addition to match fees and serve as both financial security and an indicator of a player’s standing in the national setup.","The board of control for cricket in india ( bcci ) is set to make a major overhaul in its annual central contracts system.

India’s designated No. 3 in T20Is, Tilak Varma, is set to reach the BCCI’s Centre of Excellence (CoE) on Tuesday, TimesofIndia.com has learnt.Tilak has been ruled out of the first three T20Is against New Zealand, starting Wednesday, after undergoing surgery in Rajkot for an abdominal issue a couple of weeks ago during the Vijay Hazare Trophy.TimesofIndia.com also understands that India’s Asia Cup hero is not feeling any pain and is heading to the CoE for a fitness test and further assessment to get Return to Play.“If everything goes well, he will be fit before the fourth T20I on January 28 in Visakhapatnam. He has resumed physical training and, in a day or two, will start batting and other skill-based activities,” a source tracking developments told TimesofIndia.com.After playing the T20I series against South Africa in December, Tilak led Hyderabad in two 50-over matches at the Vijay Hazare Trophy. He scored 109 against Chandigarh on January 3 and followed it up with 34 against Bengal on January 6.
