During a drinks break in the 40th over of India's chase, KL Rahul spoke with Virat Kohli , appearing to encourage him to stay at the crease until the end. With India requiring 65 runs from 60 balls against Australia on Tuesday, KL Rahul took on the role of aggressor in this Champions Trophy semi-final in Dubai.Rahul quickly scored a four and a six in his next five deliveries to ease the pressure on Kohli. He then rotated the strike to Kohli when India needed 40 runs from 45 balls, with Kohli 16 runs away from his 52nd ODI century.Kohli, despite being in control throughout the chase, attempted an unnecessary slog sweep against Adam Zampa and was caught at long-on. This uncharacteristic dismissal visibly frustrated KL Rahul at the non-striker's end.""Main maar raha that naa (I was going after the bowling),"" Rahul told Kohli as he walked past him.In the dressing room, coach Gautam Gambhir was also left visibly upset and mumbled something to the support staff and players seated alongside him.After the match, KL Rahul revealed his conversation with Kohli. ""When I walked in and when I played 10-12 balls I told him that you're the batter that needs to go on and be there till the end. And let me try and hit or let me try and take one chance an over. Because like you said we only needed 6 runs and over. But 6 runs and over on that wicket seemed like 8-8.5. So, you had to take one chance and over, one boundary or one six,"" Rahul told Star Sports.""So, I told him that I will do that and why don't you just rotate the strike and be there because you're the set batter and it might be harder. If you get out another set batter comes it becomes a lot more harder. But yeah, he felt like it was in his range to hit and yeah he didn't time it well.""Rahul maintained his composure and finished unbeaten with 42 runs from 34 balls, securing the victory with a six in the 49th over's first ball. This win advanced India to their fifth Champions Trophy final. Hardik Pandya contributed with a quick 28 runs from 24 balls before his dismissal.Despite the one mistimed shot, Kohli's performance was exceptional. He formed a crucial 91-run partnership for the third wicket with Shreyas Iyer, who scored 45 runs, after the early dismissals of Rohit Sharma (28) and Shubman Gill (9).Although Australia were missing key players, India hadn't defeated them in ICC tournament knockouts since the 2011 World Cup quarterfinal.Kohli effectively handled leg-spinner Adam Zampa, who had previously troubled him. He utilised pull shots and drives between sweeper cover and mid-wicket for consistent scoring.After losing both Iyer and Axar Patel (27) in quick succession, Kohli reached his fifty in 53 balls. Glenn Maxwell dropped a catch when Kohli was on 51 off Cooper Connolly's bowling.Kohli's innings ended when India needed 40 runs to win, as he hit the ball to Ben Dwarshuis at long-on off Zampa's bowling.","Virat kohli was 16 runs away from his 52nd odi century.

Contract and consistency concerns surround Jeremy Swayman

Boston Bruins goaltender Jeremy Swayman has been facing criticism after a recent 1-0 loss to the Minnesota Wild, despite making 21 saves. Some fans have questioned his performance, pointing to his large contract and missed training camp as possible reasons for inconsistency. However, many Bruins supporters argue that blaming Swayman alone is unfair, as the team's struggles go beyond just goaltending, including defensive mistakes and a lack of offensive production.The Boston Bruins lost 1-0 to the Wild, with Frederick Gaudreau deflecting in the only goal. Jeremy Swayman made 21 saves, but Filip Gustavsson’s 28-save shutout sealed Boston’s defeat.The Bruins' fanbase is divided over Jeremy Swayman. Some critics believe he hasn’t lived up to his big contract, blaming his offseason choices and missed training camp for an inconsistent season. A Reddit user writes, “While I agree that some of the criticism of Swayman is just low-level knuckledraggin – you also have to acknowledge that he is NOT playing up to level, especially 8×8.25 mil level.”A fan argues Swayman’s $8.25M salary is too high, citing his missed camp and media appearances as selfish. They claim he’s too inconsistent for a full workload.Saying, which a fan notes, “The off-season antics. Parading himself on local podcasts and talking through his agent—like he was coming off a Stanley Cup win or multiple for that matter. Putting his ‘worth/value’ ahead of the team and missing camp—while leaders before him took pay cuts.”Many fans push back against blaming Swayman, arguing that Boston’s real problem is poor team performance. With weak defense and a struggling offense, swapping goalies wouldn’t fix everything. One fan calls out the criticism as “low IQ,” pointing out that hockey is a team sport and pinning it all on Swayman is unfair. While he may not be at his best, he can’t carry the team alone.“It is ASTOUNDING how much we are blaming Swayman for this season, like I know he hasn’t been the greatest but do you see the defense we have? And the offense is even worse! This subreddit is just an echo chamber of low IQ takes. This team is overall just terrible, and pinning the blame on one player of a TEAM SPORT is laughable.”Also Read: “He is a patriot, he loves Canada”: Ontario Premier Doug Ford defends Wayne Gretzky amid ongoing backlash over his connection with Donald Trump The debate over Swayman’s performance continues, but the bigger issue seems to be Boston’s overall struggles.

Sidney Crosby determined to lift Pittsburgh Penguins through struggles

Sidney Crosby shut down trade rumors , reaffirming his commitment to the Pittsburgh Penguins . Speculation grew after Colorado traded Mikko Rantanen, linking Crosby to the Avalanche, but he dismissed it, stating he can't control rumors and won’t address them repeatedly. For now, his focus remains on the Penguins.The Penguins have struggled this season, currently sitting near the bottom of the Eastern Conference and at risk of missing the playoffs for the third consecutive year. Despite this,Sidney Crosby remains focused on doing everything he can to help the team, stating that his priority is to perform at his best, be a good teammate, and help Pittsburgh through this difficult period.Aarif Deen, the go-to guy for all things #Avs over at @colhockeynow, hopped on X on March 4 lead some trade scoop. He shared,“Crosby was asked if he’s aware of how many people in Denver would love to see him and MacK play together after 4 Nations.” And Sidney, Cool as ever, shutting down the frenzy with a simple, “I’m sure there’s a lot of hypotheticals out there,” before finishing his press conference.Just when it seemed like the Crosby trade rumors were fading, the Penguins' PR team delivered a bombshell: “You’ll see them together again at the Olympics!” That one-liner instantly reignited excitement about a potential Sidney Crosby–Nathan MacKinnon reunion—not in Colorado, but on the international stage.Sidney Crosby and Nathan MacKinnon , both from Nova Scotia, share a deep bond as elite centers. While often rivals, they’ve trained together for years, pushing each other to excel. MacKinnon admires Crosby’s relentless drive, and their long-awaited team-up at the 4 Nations Face-Off was a dream come true for hockey fans.A sudden Crosby trade? Unlikely. NHL insider Darren Dreger says if Crosby ever leaves, it won’t be rushed—it’ll be on his terms, with a proper farewell. For now, he’s staying put.Sidney Crosby dismissed trade rumors after Carolina acquired Mikko Rantanen, stating he won’t entertain speculation.

Evander Kane Gets Brutally Trolled By Fans Amid Speculations Of Edmonton Oilers’ Trading Him



Evander Kane, the star player of the Edmonton Oilers , has been going through a pretty tough time both in his career and in his personal life. He is still recovering from his injury and the last time Evander Kane was seen on ice was in the 2023-24 season when he played 77 games for the Edmonton Oilers. As per Chris Johnston and Pierre LeBrun, Evander Kane’s team has been looking to trade him. But fans have a lot of different opinions on this issue.Recently, Sportsnet’s Elliotte Friedman reported that the star player has submitted a list of teams that he would accept a trade from. However, fans feel differently about the entire situation.A fan took to X and wrote, “Evander Kane is not a star. Someone with a career high of 57 points (mind you that was literally 13 years ago) is not a star lmao let’s be real here”, while another fan wrote, “Evander Kane is not making life easy for the Edmonton Oilers. No wonder they want him gone. Toxic personality.”A third fan wrote, “The Edmonton Oilers not upgrading on their TERRIBLE goaltending just so Evander Kane can play a few regular season games would be an awful decision, he hasnt been the same player since all of his injuries, had major surgeries & doesn't have great chemistry with McDavid & Draisaitl”.Another user wrote, “please trade evander kane holy f**k”. However, Evander Kane’s fans have continued to defend him against the haters.A fan wrote, “Oilers fans are sh*tting on Evander Kane but the dude is out in the community doing good for the city and the people here…”, while another fan wrote, “Unpopular opinion, but Evander Kane is not an a*shole or selfish for wanting to play hockey instead of sitting on the shelf. That's completely within his right to do, and he should want to play hockey”.Currently, Evander Kane has not responded to all the criticism he has received. With the trade deadline being on Friday, all eyes are on the Edmonton Oilers.

Myles Garrett wants out. After eight seasons with the Cleveland Browns, the four-time All-Pro and 2023 Defensive Player of the Year has formally requested a trade. Not for money. Not for personal reasons. He wants a real shot at a Super Bowl.The problem? Cleveland isn’t interested. They don’t want to lose their best player, and they’re making that clear.

They’re standing their ground. They won’t trade him. They’ll make him play out his contract. That’s the stance. For now.The front office knows what this means. The moment Garrett makes this a problem—if he skips camp, refuses to play, or does anything that forces their hand—this situation flips. The trade market explodes. Offers roll in.

Pius Suter is unlikely to sign a new deal with the Canucks

An NHL insider has provided an update on negotiations between Pius Suter and the Vancouver Canucks , stating that Suter, a reliable bottom-six option for Rick Tocchet since signing a two-year contract in August 2023, may be coming to a close. Elliotte Friedman, an insider for Sportsnet, discussed the potential actions of each National Hockey League team before the trade deadline on Monday's ""32 Thoughts"" podcast.Vancouver Canucks forward Pius Suter, who will become a free agent, seems unlikely to sign a new deal with the club. Consequently, he has been one of the leading candidates to be traded ahead of the trade deadline. With his versatility and two-way game, a number of teams have shown interest in trading for him.The Canucks are presently in talks with the Dallas Stars for Suter, reports The Hockey News's Adam Kierszenblat. Negotiations between the teams have apparently been going on well, and it is possible a deal may soon be sealed. Any formal news, however, is likely to follow the conclusion of the Stars' game against the New Jersey Devils on Tuesday.Suter, who inked a deal with the Canucks in 2023, has been an asset depth forward, making contributions both offensively and defensively. It would give the Canucks some assets to push for the playoffs while giving the Stars some depth with a solid center. As negotiations are ongoing, everyone will be keeping an eye on if the two clubs could make it happen in the next few days.""Sources have indicated that the #Canucks and #TexasHockey are working on a deal for Pius Suter.

LeBron James' unbreakable legacy: 5 NBA milestones that could stand forever,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/lebron-james-unbreakable-legacy-5-nba-milestones-that-could-stand-forever/articleshow/118735993.cms,"Image via Getty Images

LeBron James’ legendary 21-year career has redefined basketball greatness. From becoming the NBA’s all-time scoring leader to averaging a triple-double in the Finals, his feats are a testament to dominance in every era. With modern players facing shorter careers and stricter rest rules, these milestones may stand forever. Here are five LeBron records that could defy time.1. Most Combined Points (Regular Season + Playoffs)LeBron has scored over 50,000 points in his NBA career when combining regular-season games (38,387 points as of 2023) and playoffs (8,023 points). He’s the only player to cross 45,000+ combined points. To break it, a player would need 20+ elite seasons without major injuries a nearly impossible task.2. Most Consecutive Games Scoring 10+ PointsLeBron scored at least 10 points in 1,068 straight games (from 2007 to 2021). This streak lasted 15 years and proves his unmatched consistency. No active player is even close—the next-best streak is 562 games by Kevin Durant.3. Youngest to Hit Major Scoring MilestonesLeBron was the youngest ever to reach 1,000, 10,000, 20,000, and 30,000 career points. For example, he hit 30,000 points at age 33—three years younger than Kobe Bryant. Today’s NBA rules prevent players from jumping straight from high school to the pros, making this record even safer.4. All-Time Regular Season Scoring LeaderIn 2023, LeBron broke Kareem Abdul-Jabbar’s 39-year-old record to become the NBA’s all-time leading scorer (currently over 40,000 points). The next active player, Kevin Durant, trails by over 12,000 points. Catching LeBron would require averaging 25 points a game for 12+ seasons—a huge ask for anyone.5. Only NBA Finals Triple-Double AverageIn the 2017 Finals, LeBron averaged 33.6 points, 12 rebounds, and 10 assists per game—the only player to ever average a triple-double in the championship series. Even stars like Nikola Jokić or Luka Dončić, who excel in triple-doubles, haven’t matched this in the high-pressure Finals.Also read: LeBron James scales the historic peak of 50,000 points in NBA LeBron James’s records are more than numbers—they are narratives of excellence, endurance, and evolution. With each game, he redefines what is possible on the basketball court, setting a standard that may well stand unchallenged for generations to come.","Lebron james has scored over 50,000 points in his nba career when combining regular-season games (38,387 points as of 2023) and playoffs.

The Day Fans Thought Rey Mysterio Died: Inside the Shocking Mix-Up

Hold onto your masks, wrestling fans, because the Mysterio family tree just got a little more… complicated. Like a plot twist from a Christopher Nolan flick, the lineage of lucha libre royalty is swirling with history, legacy, and enough drama to fill a season of Succession. We’re talking about Rey Misterio Sr. , the OG high-flyer, who sadly passed away on December 20, 2024, leaving behind a legacy that’s more tangled than a headphone cord in your pocket. But fear not, because we're here to unravel the mystery of the Mysterio/Misterio's.Think of Rey Misterio Sr. as the wrestling equivalent of a Jedi Master, laying the groundwork for a dynasty. He was throwing dropkicks and defying gravity long before Rey Mysterio Jr. was hitting the 619. Remember Starrcade 1990? That was Misterio Sr., showcasing his skills on a global stage, a true pioneer of the sport. He was like the wrestling equivalent of a vintage record, a classic that paved the way for the hits to come. Now, let's talk about Rey Mysterio Jr., the man who made Lucha Libre a household name. He's basically the wrestling equivalent of a superhero origin story, taking the foundation laid by his uncle and launching it into the stratosphere. He brought us the 619, the West Coast Pop, and a level of athleticism that would make Spider-Man jealous. He took the torch and ran with it, transforming it into a blazing inferno.But the Mysterio saga doesn’t end there. Enter Dominik Mysterio , Rey Jr.’s son, who's currently channeling his inner Darth Vader with The Judgment Day. He’s gone from a fresh-faced rookie to a heel that would make even Loki proud. It’s a classic story of generational conflict, like a wrestling version of The Lion King, but with more leather and less singing. He’s taking the family legacy and giving it a dark, rebellious twist, showing us that the Mysterio bloodline is as unpredictable as a Netflix algorithm. Let’s not forget, that Misterio Sr. didn't just pop out of thin air. He was a boxer turned luchador, a gritty competitor who transitioned from throwing punches to throwing opponents. He was still in the ring in April 2023, teaming up with Aero Star and Mr. Iguana to take down Hereje, Hijo de Pirata Morgan, and Nightmare Azteca, proving that age is just a number. He was a true warrior, a legend who inspired generations.ALSO READ: What's in the Card for AJ Styles?

Josh Allen’s Eventful Offseason: MVP Glory, Engagement Bliss, and a Bachelor Party with the Boys



Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen may not have led his team to the Super Bowl, but his 2024 season was nothing short of spectacular. Capping off a career-best performance, Allen secured the prestigious AP Most Valuable Player (MVP) award, proving once again why he is one of the league’s most electrifying quarterbacks. Beyond his impressive stats—3,731 passing yards, 28 touchdowns, and an additional 513 rushing yards with 12 scores—the 28-year-old also found personal success, as he proposed to Hollywood star Hailee Steinfeld during the Bills’ bye week.While the couple has kept their wedding plans private, Josh Allen recently took some time off to enjoy his bachelor party in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. According to WPBF sports anchor Yianni Kourakis, Allen and his close circle of friends, including his brother Jason Allen, headed to the Sunshine State to kick off the celebrations. Given Allen’s love for golf, it was no surprise that the event was centered around the sport, particularly at the TGL event on March 4.The star-studded bachelor trip included some notable NFL names, such as Minnesota Vikings quarterback Sam Darnold, Pittsburgh Steelers quarterback Kyle Allen, Jacksonville Jaguars wide receiver Christian Kirk, and Buffalo Bills tight end Dalton Kincaid. Interestingly, Allen had previously mentioned Darnold, Kirk, and Kyle Allen as his “dream golf foursome” in a CBS Sports interview last summer, making this gathering all the more special.The group attended the TGL match featuring Tiger Woods ' Jupiter Links Golf Club taking on Atlanta Drive GC, and they weren’t shy about getting into the spirit of the game. While the new golf league promises a unique and intense atmosphere, Allen and his friends embraced the fun, even getting a bit rowdy with their energetic reactions.During ESPN’s coverage of the event, Allen was interviewed about his offseason plans. When asked what he had in store, he responded with a perfectly timed and thoughtful answer:“Honestly, doing … listen, doing whatever my fiancée wants to do right now. I’m a smart man, I get it. She was in Buffalo this last past season. Whatever I can do to help out I’m going to do.”That’s exactly the kind of response one would expect from an MVP—both on and off the field. While he enjoyed his time with the guys, he made it clear that Steinfeld remains his top priority.The actress, who has been turning heads with her stunning looks recently, was busy making waves at the Oscars while Allen attended the golf event. Despite their time apart, the couple has been inseparable, sharing a passionate moment at the NFL Honors 2025 show with a public display of affection.While Allen is making the most of his offseason with golf outings and time with friends, he remains devoted to supporting Steinfeld in her endeavors. Just last month, he joined her in Italy for Milan Fashion Week and attended her ""Angel Margarita"" launch party. As for his own passions, Allen has already committed to competing in the American Century Celebrity Golf Championship in July.Also Read: Eagles GM Howie Roseman compares winning Super Bowls to sex in bold NSFW remark From leading the Bills on the field to balancing love and leisure off it, Josh Allen is proving that he can quarterback both his career and personal life with equal success.","Buffalo bills quarterback josh allen recently celebrated his bachelor party in palm beach gardens, florida.

The Vancouver Canucks faced another setback on Saturday night, falling 6-3 to the Seattle Kraken in a game filled with momentum swings. Despite taking the lead twice, defensive lapses and a late surge from Seattle proved too much to overcome. With this loss marking their fourth in five games, the Canucks are struggling to find consistency as their slump deepens.Elias Pettersson ’s scoring struggles are a growing concern for the Canucks. With just one goal and six assists in 20 games, his offensive dip is evident. His $11.6 million-per-year contract, which includes a no-movement clause starting in July, raises questions about his future.His offensive output has declined, he's shooting less, his one-timers rank 181st in the league, and fewer than half hit the target. Compared to 2022-23, he’s generating fewer scoring chances.After Tuesday’s practice, Pettersson admitted he hasn’t met expectations but is focused on moving forward.""I think about it a lot. I'll just be honest, I haven't been the way I want to be this year. I haven't played to the expectations I have on myself, or the franchise has on me, but that's in the past. I wish we had more wins, I wish I had played a lot better, but can't dwell on that anymore,"" Pettersson mentioned.He also addressed his ""annoying"" media comment from Feb. 25, admitting frustration got the best of him.""I was really, really mad at that moment. I said something I didn't mean. Said media is annoying, which is some days can but it's the last thing that's making me play bad or not myself this year. I just wanted to make that clear,"" Pettersson added.With the playoffs approaching, the Canucks need Pettersson to regain his scoring touch fast.The Vancouver Canucks’ struggles continued with a 6-3 loss to the Seattle Kraken on Saturday, their fourth defeat in five games.

Auston Matthews’ “Poor” Performance Sparks Speculation Among Fans Regarding His “Decline”





Stay tuned for the IND vs AUS Live Score and follow real-time match updates. Get the latest Cricket Live Score and stay ahead with every ball.



Auston Matthews, one of the most talented players in the NHL and the captain of the Toronto Maple Leafs, has been in the centre of controversy as fans believe he has not been able to perform well in this season. Recently, hosts of Sportsnet’s Leafs Talk, JD Bunkis and Sam McKee, discussed about Auston Matthews’ performance, and fans have certain opinions about it.In the recent episode of Sportsnet’s Leafs Talk, JD Bunkis says, “The big thing for me in this game…a big takeaway..there is just something about Matthews’ body language that’s not there for me this year”. His co-host, Sam McKee, seems to agree with this and says, “Yeah we talk about this a lot…I’m out of theories”.JD Bunkis then does acknowledge how Auston Matthews is injured and that might play a big role in his “poor performance” this season but he also questions the reason for Auston Matthews to be playing if “he is that injured”.JD Bunkis says, “...the aura is not the same” and it seems like fans agree with this opinion.A fan wrote, “Body language is horrible. Showed up Nylander twice when he didn’t feed him on the PP. He’s barely bending his knees while skating and he’s just stick checking instead of taking the body. If this is what we’re gonna get come April, see you on the golf course May 8th.”Another fan wrote, “Look at all the different guesses in this thread as to what’s wrong with him. Could it be that we are seeing the decline of Matthews and it’s happening faster than we imagined? I really hope it’s just an off year but my guess is it’s not. He’s definitely a shell of himself.”A third fan wrote, “The only difference from this year to last year is him wearing the C. Is his attention being pulled in too many directions that he has no time to think about the game? Is he checked out because he scored 69 goals last year but fans still shit on him for the playoff outcome?”Recently, the Toronto Maple Leafs suffered a devastating loss against the San Jose Sharks and are now gearing up for a match against the Vegas Golden Knights. Auston Matthews has not addressed all the speculations around him and has maintained silence. Even at the 4 Nations Face Off, Matthews' team could not win so fans are a bit disappointed in him.Also Read: Auston Matthews' words for J.T.

Marc-Edouard Vlasic’s legacy of toughness

Also Read:

Blocked shots don’t always make the highlight reels, but they win games and Marc-Edouard Vlasic just cemented his place in history by doing exactly that. The veteran defenseman set a new NHL record for career blocked shots during the San Jose Sharks ’ dominant 6-2 win over the Buffalo Sabres on Tuesday night. At 37 years old, Vlasic has proven once again why he remains a crucial force on the ice.The Sharks have a tradition of awarding a thick black vest to their player of the game after a victory, and on this night, there was no doubt who deserved it.Early in the first period, Vlasic stepped in front of Zach Benson’s wrist shot just 2:16 into the game, officially surpassing Mark Giordano ’s record. He finished the night with two blocks, pushing his career total to 2,166. Given his relentless defensive style, the extra padding from the vest seemed like a fitting reward.“He knows how to play the position, puts his body in the lanes, blocked big shots his whole career. You guys have seen it,” Sharks coach Ryan Warsofsky said. “I know how proud each of his teammates are. They gave him a standing ovation in the locker room. It was quite a scene and well-deserved.” (via: AP News)The 41-year-old Giordano, who previously held the record, remains unsigned after spending the past three seasons with Toronto.Vlasic has been a defensive cornerstone for the Sharks since his rookie season in 2006-07, the year after the NHL began tracking blocked shots. Over his 19-year career, he has played 1,308 games, consistently ranking among the league’s most reliable shot-blockers.“Just incredible, an incredible achievement,” said goalie Alexandar Georgiev, who stopped 20 shots in the victory. “It feels like he hasn’t played in a while, but he got back into the lineup and just making all the right plays at the right time. You can see that he’s a special player. Very nice player.”Vlasic’s durability is just as impressive as his defensive instincts. The Montreal native ranks eighth among active players in career games played and has topped the 100-block mark in a season 12 times. Despite missing the first 40 games this season with an upper-body injury, he has already recorded 22 blocks in 12 games since his return.“When it’s your turn to block, you block it,” Vlasic stated. “I’ll step in front of any puck I need to to make sure it doesn’t get to the goalie.”And with that mindset, he has etched his name in NHL history .","Marc-edouard vlasic set a new nhl record for career blocked shots during the san jose sharks ’ dominant 6-2 win over the buffalo sabres on tuesday night.

When and where to Darius Garland play tonight against the Miami Heat (March 5, 2025)?

The Cleveland Cavaliers have received a major boost ahead of their Wednesday, March 5, clash against the Miami Heat, as star guard Darius Garland has been cleared to play. Garland, who has been a vital part of the Cavaliers’ success this season, is set to take the court at Rocket Mortgage FieldHouse after being listed as day-to-day due to a lingering injury. Darius Garland ’s return comes at a crucial time for the Cleveland Cavaliers, who are looking to maintain their dominance in the Eastern Conference. Averaging 17.8 points and 5.6 assists over the last 20 games, Garland’s playmaking and three-point shooting (2.6 made threes per game) are essential to Cleveland’s league-leading offense, which scores 123.3 points per game. His presence will be particularly valuable against a Heat team that ranks seventh in the NBA in defensive efficiency, allowing just 110.5 points per contest.The Cleveland Cavaliers have managed to stay afloat despite injury concerns, thanks to standout performances from Donovan Mitchell, who leads the team with 24.3 points per game, and Jarrett Allen, who averages a double-double with 12.6 points and 11.1 rebounds. However, Garland’s ability to control the tempo and create opportunities for his teammates elevates Cleveland’s game, especially in high-stakes matchups like this one.On the other side, the Miami Heat are dealing with significant injury issues, with six players listed on their report, including key contributors like Jaime Jaquez Jr. and Nikola Jovic. Tyler Herro and Bam Adebayo will need to carry the load for Miami, but the Cavaliers’ depth and home-court advantage make them the favorites heading into the game.With Darius Garland fit to play, the Cleveland Cavaliers are in a strong position to extend their impressive 51-10 record. The game tips off at 7 p.m. ET and will be broadcast on ESPN, FDSOH, and FDSSUN. Fans can also stream the game live on Fubo, though regional restrictions may apply.Also read: Will Donovan Mitchell play tonight against the Miami Heat?
