NEW DELHI: Former Bihar minister and Lalu Prasad Yadav 's estranged son Tej Pratap Yadav on Sunday refuted social media posts which claimed that he has been “blessed with a daughter”, Anushka Yadav.During a press conference, Tej Pratap dubbed RJD MP Sanjay Yadav, MLC Sunil Singh, former MLAs Shakti Singh Yadav and Mukesh Raushan, and Rameez — a close friend of Tejashwi Yadav — as “Jaichands” (a metaphor for traitors, referring to a 10th-century Rajput chieftain who had colluded with Afghan invader Muhammad Ghori) and accused them of hatching a conspiracy against him.Notably, Sanjay Yadav is a sitting RJD MP and Sunil Singh is an MLC, while Shakti Singh Yadav and Mukesh Raushan are former MLAs, and Rameez is a close friend of Tejashwi Yadav, the younger sibling of Tej Pratap, who was recently elevated to the post of the party's national working president.Also read | 'Reject this’: Tej Pratap Yadav rubbishes child rumours, says no link with woman named in past Facebook post “I am distraught at rumours on social media that a woman with whom I had been falsely linked several months ago, which resulted in my expulsion from the party, has given birth to my child,” Tej Pratap said.“There has been some suspense about who the Jaichands I have been speaking about are. Here are the names — Mukesh Raushan, Sanjay Yadav, Shakti Singh Yadav, Rameez and Sunil Singh,” he added.He also vowed to take legal action against the “Jaichands”, including a Rajya Sabha MP and a member of the legislative council.“I reject this (blessed with a child) claim. This is a conspiracy hatched by Mukesh Raushan and all these ‘jaichands’ in collusion to defame me.It should be investigated who Akash Bhati is, who has a relationship with that girl. This should be investigated, not what kind of relationship she has with him. What kind of relationship does that girl have with him?” Tej Pratap said.“Akash Bhati will tell you. Mukesh Raushan, Shakti Singh and Sunil Singh are all ‘jaichands’; this is all their game, to conspire against us. Now, let them explain what the relationship is between Anushka Yadav and Akash Bhati; they will tell you. I am completely depressed. We will submit our application, we will go to court,” he added.Last year, Tej Pratap was ousted from the party and his family after he shared a photo with a woman on Facebook and claimed he had been in a relationship with her for 12 years.However, Tej Pratap later claimed that his Facebook account had been “hacked” and said the post was part of an attempt to “defame and harass” him and his family.Tej Pratap later founded his own party — Janshakti Janata Dal — which drew a blank in the Bihar assembly elections","Janshakti janta dal chief tej pratap yadav rubbishes child rumours.

Did the NFL predict a Seahawks-Patriots Super Bowl LX matchup in September?

Why the September NFL graphic fueled conspiracy theories

Sam Darnold and Drake Maye at the center of the online storm

On the eve of Super Bowl LX, in which the Seattle Seahawks will take on the New England Patriots, an outlandish fan theory has gone viral on social media as the NFL prepares to kick off. A league-issued image promoting their schedule from earlier this season, back in September, resurfaced recently, with several fans claiming it foreshadowed the exact matchup many months in advance. A standard piece of marketing material turned out to be the trigger for a full-blown online debate.The image in question was of one player from each of the 32 NFL teams lined up in front of Levi's Stadium, the site of the next Super Bowl. Then, it was just seen as a salute to the opening week. And now, following the Seahawks and Patriots gaining entry into the title game, fans are going back to the image and saying that it must have contained allusions to the future.This renewed interest centers on where certain players were positioned in the promotional image. Advocates of the theory note that Seahawks quarterback Sam Darnold and Patriots quarterback Drake Maye appear to be positioned just right of center in the image compared to several others.Some fans think that detail is just way too perfect in its coincidence of timing, especially since both teams ultimately made it to the league's final game of the season.On X, Instagram, and TikTok, posts analyzing the graphic, circling figures, drawing lines, and claiming that the league was subtly revealing the final outcome have gone viral. This has been followed by jokes on social media that the NFL is rigged, a longstanding internet meme that the results of pro football games are predetermined.However, officials have shot down the speculation. NFL representatives said in a statement that the picture is intended simply to promote an exciting new season and not to favor any team over another. They assert that there was no effort to forecast or sway playoff outcomes. To them, the theory is just creative license on top of a basic marketing post.It is not the first time that football fans have sought the secret meaning hidden within a league graphic. We've seen similar theories in the past, particularly about the colors of the Super Bowl logos. Whenever an improbable pairing takes place, internet sleuths find 'proof' that it was secretly planned long ago.The NFL does not make preseason predictions; analysts, computer models, and betting markets do. Before the season began, Seattle and New England weren't exactly chalked in making the championship game. The playoff runs of both teams surprised many so-called experts, helping to further fuel the conspiracy theory.","A league-issued image promoting their schedule from earlier this season, back in september, resurfaced recently, with several fans claiming it foreshadowed the exact matchup many months in advance.

Bad Bunny: Headlining the Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show

How to watch the halftime show at Super Bowl 2026

The football is only half the story at Super Bowl 2026. The matchup between the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks has turned the Bay Area into a rolling red carpet.All week, artists, actors, billionaire owners and reality stars have been bouncing between Pier 48, Union Square, Daly City and Levi’s Stadium, setting up one of the most crowded celebrity Super Bowls in years.The headline act is halftime star Bad Bunny. Fresh off a historic Album of the Year win, he told reporters he wants to bring ""a lot of my culture"" to the Apple Music Super Bowl LX Halftime Show, while keeping the setlist under wraps.Cardi B is everywhere this week. She is headlining Michael Rubin’s Fanatics party and is rumored, per multiple reports, to be a candidate to join Bad Bunny for “I Like It” on the halftime stage. Her boyfriend, Patriots wide receiver Stefon Diggs, has already gone viral after stepping off the plane in San Francisco with a black Birkin bag, faux fur jacket and matching boots.Around the Bay, the A-list has been busy. The San Francisco Chronicle and other outlets have already spotted:On the 'expected' side, celebrity lists from Newsweek, TIME and others have circled Ben Affleck, Jeff Bezos, Kim Kardashian, Barack Obama and Jon Hamm as likely faces in suites at Levi’s.Affleck is back in Super Bowl ad rotations. Bezos remains glued to any game tied to franchise movement. Kardashian family members are tied to Fanatics promos and charity bets. Hamm has already hosted NFL Honors and fronted a Ritz campaign this week.Add in Russell Wilson and Ciara in North Beach, reality stars like Maura Higgins and U.K. influencers at sponsor events, plus NFL legends from Michael Irvin to Deion Sanders around fan fests, and the guest list looks closer to an awards show than a football game.The NFL has confirmed a tight, staged music lineup for Super Bowl LX. Reports from CBS News, league releases, and Apple Music have locked in:Bad Bunny will become the first native Spanish speaker to headline the Super Bowl halftime show. He is not cashing a monster performance check, though. As reported previously with past headliners, halftime acts are paid only a small union rate while the NFL and Apple Music cover the massive production bill. The real payoff is the global audience and the spike in streams, sales and ticket demand that usually follows.The choice has drawn backlash in some political circles, especially after Bad Bunny said “ICE out” at the Grammys. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell has repeatedly backed the pick, calling him ""one of the leading and most popular entertainers in the world"" and stressing that the league wants artists who can use the stage to bring people together.Super Bowl LX kicks off Sunday, Feb. 8, at 6:30 p.m. ET on NBC, with streaming available on Peacock. Pregame coverage rolls straight into Green Day’s opening performance and the national anthem.Bad Bunny’s halftime show will hit the stage between the second and third quarters, with Apple Music and the NFL pushing full behind-the-scenes and replay content across social platforms after the live performance.Seattle did it again. For the second time in franchise history, the Seahawks are Super Bowl champions after a 29-13 win over the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LX.Seattle’s “Dark Side” defense set the tone all night, hammering Patriots QB Drake Maye with six sacks and forcing three turnovers. Derick Hall sparked the takeaway party with a third-quarter strip sack, then Uchenna Nwosu and Julian Love sealed it with fourth-quarter interceptions.Kenneth Walker III earned Super Bowl MVP and carried the offense with 135 rushing yards on 5.0 a pop. Sam Darnold stayed clean, finishing 19-of-38 for 202 yards and a touchdown without a turnover. New England’s lone push came on a 35-yard Mack Hollins TD that made it 19-7, but the Patriots never got closer after the next pair of picks.","The nfl has confirmed a tight, staged music lineup for super bowl lx.

Thecontinue to operate with urgency in 2026, and. has become one of the most discussed names in trade conversations. The Utah Jazz only acquired the two-way big man on February 3 in a major deal with Memphis, but league chatter suggests Golden State explored serious talks before shifting focus elsewhere. Even after the deadline, the idea of a future Warriors-Jazz deal has not fully disappeared.Jackson is under contract with Utah through the 2028-29 season after signing a four-year extension worth about $205 million in 2025. His cap hit for 2025-26 sits near $35 million. Utah gave up three future first-round picks along with several rotation players to acquire him, so the team is not expected to move him unless the return is substantial. For now, he is part of a frontcourt built around Lauri Markkanen and Walker Kessler.If Golden State Warriors revisits the idea, the offer would likely center on young players and draft picks.• Jaren Jackson Jr. (F/C, 26, $35M cap hit)• John Konchar (G, 29, $6.2M, 3-and-D wing)• Jonathan Kuminga (PF, 23, projected $20M-25M, UFA after 2026)• Moses Moody (SG/SF, 23, two-way wing on $11.5M)• Brandin Podziemski (SG, 22, $3.7M, starting guard)• 2026 first-round pick (top-14 protected)• 2029 first-round pick (unprotected)The structure reflects the type of package typically required for an established two-way big in his prime.Golden State’s timeline is clear. Stephen Curry, now 37, still produces at a high level, and Draymond Green remains central to the defense. What the roster lacks is a reliable interior defender who can also space the floor.Jaren Jackson offers both.He averages about 2.2 blocks for his career and is recording roughly 1.7 blocks and 1.5 steals this season. He shoots around 34-35% from three and makes about two per game, which fits Golden State’s spacing. At 26, he also provides a bridge between the current core and the next phase of the roster.A lineup featuring Curry, Podziemski, Jimmy Butler, Green, and Jackson would add length and defensive range without sacrificing shooting.Utah Jazz invested heavily to get Jackson, so any deal would need to strengthen the roster long term.Kuminga brings scoring potential and athleticism at 23. Moody and Podziemski are young perimeter players on manageable contracts who fit a team focused on shooting and defense. Two first-round picks would help recover some of the draft capital already spent.Moving Jackson would also remove about $35 million from the payroll, giving the front office more flexibility if it decides to reshape the roster around Markkanen and Kessler.• Immediate improvement in rim protection• A frontcourt player who can shoot• A move that supports another title push• Loss of three young rotation players• Large salary commitment• Possible overlap with Kristaps Porziņģis and Quinten Post• Adds multiple young players with upside• Restores draft flexibility• Creates financial room• Gives up a rare two-way big• Risks negative reaction after his strong start, including a 22-point debut• Injury history remains a concernIf the deal is judged strictly on assets, Utah could benefit by turning one star into three young players and two first-round picks while improving financial flexibility. Jackson’s injury history adds another layer to that calculation.Also read: NBA trade rumors: Los Angeles Lakers potentially eyeing $80 million Houston Rockets star to for iconic trio with LeBron James and Luka Doncic For Golden State, the trade would be a direct bet on the present. If Jackson stays healthy and fits the system, the team strengthens its position in the title race. If the move does not work, the cost would be felt in both depth and future roster building.","Jaren jackson jr. is under contract with utah through the 2028-29 season after signing a four-year extension worth about $205 million in 2025.

Super Bowl stakes rise as Stefon Diggs links Patriots victory to potential engagement with Cardi B



Super Bowl LX engagement buzz surrounding Cardi B and Stefon Diggs has added a personal edge to football’s biggest night. The question is simple and timely. Will a championship win also unlock a life changing decision for the New England Patriots wide receiver and the global rap star he has been dating for over a year?That curiosity gained traction on Monday when Stefon Diggs faced reporters ahead of Super Bowl LX. What began as routine media availability quickly shifted into relationship territory, blending pop culture with playoff pressure. Diggs did not dodge the moment. Instead, he leaned into it with a grin and just enough honesty to keep fans guessing.The speculation started when a reporter asked Diggs if Cardi B would be “getting her ring” should the Patriots lift the Lombardi Trophy. Diggs paused, smiled, and replied, “It’s on the agenda, maybe, right? Right?” He then grounded the moment with competitive focus, adding, “I gotta get mine first.” The message was clear. Football comes first, but the conversation is not off limits.The relationship itself has unfolded under constant public attention. Cardi B and Diggs were first seen together in February 2025, according to TMZ. By May, their appearance courtside at a New York Knicks game fueled dating chatter. In June, Cardi confirmed the romance with a yacht photo on Instagram, later deleted but never forgotten by fans.Rumors swirled again in summer when Diggs vanished from her feed. Those whispers ended in September during a CBS Mornings interview, where Cardi confirmed they were still together and shared bigger news. “I’m excited, I’m happy. I feel like I’m in a good space,” she said. “I feel very strong, I feel very powerful that I’m doing all this work — but I’m doing all this work while I’m creating a baby.”She later expanded on their shared mindset. “I feel like we’re really great and one of the best at what we do, and me and him think the same way — like, ‘Yeah, we’re one of the greatest, but what’s next?’ We have to do it again, all the time. We’re never comfortable, we just wanna keep doing it.”Their child arrived in November, marking a fresh chapter. “Starting over is never easy but it’s been so worth it!” Cardi B wrote on Instagram. “I brought new music and a new album to the world! A new baby into my world.”For Diggs, Super Bowl LX already represents a career milestone after stops in Minnesota, Buffalo, and Houston before joining New England in 2025. Whether it also becomes a personal turning point remains unanswered. Sunday night may deliver more than one ring, or it may simply set the stage for what comes next.","Super bowl stakes rise as stefon diggs links patriots victory to potential engagement with cardi b.

Is the Avengers: Doomsday trailer going to be featured at Super Bowl LX? Here’s what we know,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/is-the-avengers-doomsday-trailer-going-to-be-featured-at-super-bowl-lx-heres-what-we-know/articleshow/128075815.cms,"Marvel Studios will reportedly skip Super Bowl 2026, ending a 16-year tradition of debuting MCU trailers during the big game. That means fans should not expect new footage from Avengers: Doomsday or other 2026 projects. Rising ad costs and recent teaser releases may have influenced the decision, marking a notable shift in Marvel’s long-standing Super Bowl marketing strategy.

Why Marvel is sitting out Super Bowl LX

Marvel Studios has quietly stepped away from one of its most reliable marketing stages. After dominating Super Bowl ad breaks for over a decade, the studio will reportedly skip Super Bowl LX in 2026. That decision means fans hoping for a first big-screen tease of Avengers: Doomsday during the NFL’s biggest night may be left staring at their screens in disappointment.For 16 years, Marvel turned the Super Bowl into a launchpad for its cinematic universe. From early Iron Man spots to massive ensemble reveals, the franchise made the big game part of its promotional DNA. Now, with several high-profile projects lined up for 2026, the absence feels louder than ever.According to industry reports, Marvel Studios won't show any new movies or Disney+ series during the broadcast in 2026. That includes highly anticipated titles like Avengers: Doomsday, Spider-Man: Brand New Day, and streaming hits that are coming back. The break shows that the studio is changing its strategy, since it used to see the Super Bowl as very important.One major factor may be cost. A 30-second Super Bowl commercial now reportedly sits near the $10 million mark, a sharp jump from previous years.For a film like Avengers: Doomsday, which is scheduled for release on May 01, 2026, the studio may feel its recent marketing push already built enough early momentum. December and January delivered multiple teasers, giving fans plenty to dissect..The bigger surprise is Spider-Man: Brand New Day. A previous Spider-Man installment debuted footage during its Super Bowl release year, so many expected history to repeat itself. Instead, Marvel appears to be saving its cards for a later reveal.Interestingly, Marvel will not be alone in its absence. DC Studios is also expected to skip the game broadcast, choosing alternative platforms for promotion.Super Bowl LX will still feature major blockbuster trailers. But for the first time in years, the Marvel logo may not flash across millions of screens on football’s biggest night. For longtime fans, that break in tradition may feel like the real headline.","Marvel studios won't show any new movies or disney+ series during the broadcast in 2026.

Why did Patriots star Mack Hollins arrive at Super Bowl LX in shackles and a prison uniform?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/why-did-patriots-star-mack-hollins-arrive-at-super-bowl-lx-in-shackles-and-a-prison-uniform/articleshow/128090973.cms,"Patriots wide receiver Mack Hollins stunned fans by arriving at Super Bowl LX in a prison-style uniform, shackled at the wrists and ankles, and barefoot. Known for rejecting shoes and embracing unconventional habits, Hollins says “everyone should be barefoot” and believes it strengthens the body. His bold entrance once again spotlighted his unique philosophy and unapologetic individuality.

Mack Hollins divides fans with shackled Super Bowl LX arrival at Levi’s Stadium

Mack Hollins never arrives quietly, and Super Bowl LX was no exception. As cameras lined the entrance at Levi’s Stadium, the New England Patriots wide receiver stepped out wearing maroon prison-style scrubs with “Warriors” printed across the back. His wrists and ankles were shackled. He wore a face covering. And, true to form, he was completely barefoot.The striking entrance instantly set social media buzzing. Hollins has built a reputation for bold fashion choices and an even bolder outlook on life. Yet this Super Bowl appearance felt especially theatrical. While teammates opted for tailored suits and designer sneakers, Hollins leaned fully into symbolism, performance, and personal philosophy.Hollins did not slip on shoes once he reached the field. He stayed barefoot during pregame warmups, later changing into a jersey linked to coach Mike Vrabel’s high school roots. For longtime followers, the shoeless look was not surprising. Hollins has long championed going without footwear, even in freezing temperatures.In a 2023 interview, he explained his stance clearly. He believes ""everyone should be barefoot.""Addressing hygiene concerns, he added, ""It's so funny that people look at me like that because shoes are definitely dirtier than feet.""His reasoning goes deeper than comfort. Speaking to Sports Illustrated, Hollins outlined what he sees as physical advantages. ""Strength of the foot, strength of the knee, strength of the ankle,"" he said. ""Free electrons from the body, so you feel more grounded. You're cleaner. You move faster. You strengthen the whole body, so your knee doesn't have to take so much pressure, and your ankle is more developed.""He even compared footwear to equipment. ""Shoes are a tool,"" he said. ""You wouldn't walk around with a hammer just because you might nail something every once in a while. Why walk around in shoes just because you might step on something every once in a while?""For Hollins, individuality matters. ""Going with no shoes, having wild hair, eating with my hands instead of utensils, that type of stuff, that’s not bothering anybody. That’s who I am,"" he once said. And on football’s biggest night, he made sure everyone saw exactly who that is.","Patriots wide receiver mack hollins stunned fans by arriving at super bowl lx in a prison-style uniform, shackled at the wrists and ankles, and barefoot.

Live Attendance at Super Bowl 2025

Super Bowl 2025’s biggest moments

Expected Attendance for Super Bowl 2026

The Super Bowl is the biggest event in American sport, and is also one of the most attended live events of the year. Many people watch the game on TV or online, but only a few lucky fans get to see it in person at the stadium. Comparing the attendance figures between Super Bowl 2025 and 2026 shows how stadium size, location and league planning influence the number of fans who witness the NFL’s championship game first-hand.Super Bowl LIX took place on February 9th 2025, at the iconic Caesars Superdome in New Orleans. For big events, estimates say it can hold between 73,000 and 76,000 people.According to official counts, Super Bowl 2025 attracted an attendance figure of 65,719 fans inside the Superdome on game day. This number reflected the confirmed number of people present, including fans, staff and VIP ticket holders, rather than the total maximum seating capacity. There was an average of 127.7 million viewers across all media for the Super Bowl 2025, which was also a record.A year later, Super Bowl LX is being hosted at Levi's Stadium which is the home of the San Francisco 49ers. This stadium has a base seating capacity of 68,500 , which can be expanded for major events like the Super Bowl to around 71,000 or more.While exact attendance numbers for Super Bowl 2026 have not yet been officially released, analysts and reports suggest that attendance figures will be close to or slightly under 65,000-70,000 fans inside Levi’s Stadium.Some reports, estimates mention roughly 75,000 people making their way into the venue area and surrounding fan events, though the ticketed crowd inside the stadium proper is expected to be somewhat lower.On paper, Super Bowl LX’s host venue has a slightly smaller capacity than the Caesars Superdome, which historically accommodates larger maximum crowds. In practical terms, the live attendance for Super Bowl 2025 at around 65,700 appears to be comparable to projected figures for Super Bowl 2026, which will likely range in the same ballpark, depending on final staging and NFL decisions about seat kills and event production.Whether it is in New Orleans or Santa Clara, being part of a Super Bowl crowd remains a rare and thrilling experience for tens of thousands of fans lucky enough to secure tickets even as hundreds of millions more watch from afar.","Super bowl lix took place on february 9th 2025, at the iconic caesars superdome in new orleans.

New Kids on the block opened the pop music door

Gloria Estefan changed the language of the halftime show

Prince set the gold standard in the rain

Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake changed tv forever

Kendrick Lamar and Rihanna redefined modern halftime shows

The Super Bowl halftime show has slowly turned into one of the biggest moments in global entertainment. While football remains the heart of the night, millions now watch just to see what happens during those 13 minutes on stage. As Super Bowl LX approaches with Bad Bunny set to perform, it is worth looking back at the moments that shaped how halftime shows are viewed today. These performances were not just concerts. They changed rules, broke records, and reflected culture in real time.For many years, halftime shows were led by marching bands and safe performances. That pattern broke in 1991 when New Kids on the Block became the first major pop act to headline.The show included a children’s choir and songs aimed at a family audience. It was not widely praised, but it mattered.Donnie Wahlberg later told Playboy, “I don’t know how much pride I take in the actual performance. But I take pride in the fact that we were the first ones to do it.”In 1999, Gloria Estefan made history by becoming the first Spanish-language artist to headline a Super Bowl halftime show.According to ESPN, her Miami performance blended English and Spanish and reflected the city’s culture.Years later, speaking to E! News, Estefan advised Bad Bunny ahead of his halftime moment, saying, “Enjoy every second because it really goes by so fast.”Many critics still point to Prince's 2007 as the greatest halftime show ever. Performing during heavy rain, Prince closed with “Purple Rain,” creating a moment that felt unplanned and unforgettable. The Athletic later wrote that no performer before or after has matched the impact of that night.Not every moment brought praise. In 2004, Janet Jackson and Justin Timberlake were involved in a wardrobe malfunction watched by more than 140 million viewers, according to The Guardian. The incident led to stricter broadcast rules and changed how live TV was handled for years.In 2025, Kendrick Lamar delivered the most-watched halftime show ever, with 133.5 million viewers, according to Billboard.Two years earlier, Rihanna stunned fans by performing an entire set while pregnant, suspended above the field. BuzzFeed News praised the show for its calm confidence and control.","The super bowl halftime show has slowly turned into one of the biggest moments in global entertainment.

My Two Cents on this Mock Trade

Thelook ready to push for contention after an uneven 2025 season. Their offseason already includes a major move which was signing Pete Alonso to a five-year, $155 million contract but the club may not be done. Trade talk around the league suggests Baltimore is exploring a deal for Detroit Tigers left-hander Tarik Skubal.Nothing has been finalized as of February 2026, but several mock trades identify the Orioles as a strong fit. If a deal happens, it would impact both divisions and force each team to balance present needs with future plans.One commonly discussed proposal has Baltimore Orioles acquiring Tarik Skubal, 28, who is entering his final year before free agency. Detroit would receive outfielder Dylan Beavers, ranked No. 69 among MLB prospects, along with right-handers Trey Gibson and Luis Leon.Skubal delivered one of the best pitching seasons in baseball in 2025. He finished 13-6 with a 2.21 ERA, 241 strikeouts, a 0.891 WHIP, and 195 innings. His production has placed him among the game’s top starters.The Tigers are at least listening because of a large arbitration gap. Skubal filed for $32 million, while the team countered at $19 million.Moving him now would prevent the risk of losing him after 2026 without a return.Beavers, 24, hit .304/.420/.515 with 18 home runs in Triple-A last season. Gibson, ranked No. 46 among MLB prospects, profiles as a potential starter. Leon adds another young arm who could help the bullpen.Tarik Skubal would lead a rotation that already includes Trevor Rogers, Kyle Bradish, and Shane Baz. Rogers posted a 3.12 ERA with 198 strikeouts in 2025, Bradish recorded a 3.39 ERA with 178 strikeouts, and Baz finished with a 3.87 ERA and 162 strikeouts.Projections suggest the Orioles’ World Series odds could rise from about 10% to 25% with an ace. Alonso, who had 264 home runs, a .272 average, and an .871 OPS in 2025, strengthens a lineup that also features Adley Rutschman (28 home runs, 92 RBIs) and Gunnar Henderson (32 home runs, 103 RBIs).The risk is control. Skubal could leave after one season if the Orioles do not extend him, similar to what happened when Corbin Burnes departed.Trading Skubal would not necessarily signal a rebuild. Detroit remained competitive in 2025, with Skubal also posting a 10-11 record, a 3.11 ERA, and 223 strikeouts.Beavers could fill a corner outfield role, Gibson provides rotation depth, and Leon strengthens the pitching staff. The Tigers would also save roughly $13 million in arbitration, giving them more payroll flexibility as they plan ahead for 2027.• The Orioles add a top starter and could approach a 90-win projection.• The Tigers gain controllable prospects while staying competitive.• Skubal is positioned to command a free-agent contract that may reach $400 million.• Baltimore would reduce its farm depth.• Detroit would be trading a franchise-level pitcher.• The Orioles risk getting only one season from Skubal.Baltimore Orioles would benefit immediately if Skubal performs at his usual level. Detroit’s advantage would likely come later by adding younger players and lowering payroll pressure.Also read: MLB trade rumors: Cincinnati Reds predicted to land $10.2 million New York Yankees star slugger in hopes of improving rotation and title odds The trade remains speculative, but its impact would be significant for both teams and could influence the American League race in 2026.","The baltimore orioles signed first baseman pete alonso to a five-year, $155 million contract.

Jayson Tatum takes key rehab step with controlled scrimmages as Boston Celtics await return decision

Boston Celtics maintain cautious stance on Jayson Tatum’s return amid strong recovery progress

With a 34-18 record and the second seed in the Eastern Conference, the Boston Celtics have been having a fantastic season without their franchise player, Jayson Tatum. On the Tatum front, they may be receiving a significant update, though. Achilles, Tatum, is now able to participate in controlled 5-on-5 scrimmages with the coaching staff.It is obvious that the Celtics will not bring him back until Tatum is completely sure of his Achilles, and if that means he has to wait until 2026–2027, then the team will accept that. ESPN's Shams Charania reports that Jayson Tatum has met yet another milestone in his Achilles rehabilitation.Although this is by no means a major update, fantasy managers will accept what they can for now. There is still no set return date for Tatum, and there have been mixed rumors about whether he will try to make a comeback this season.On the network's pregame broadcast on Sunday, Charania stated that the Celtics star ""has started controlled 5-on-5 scrimmaging with coaches."" Compared to the one-on-one training that reporters have been witnessing in recent weeks, that is a step forward.Shams Charania of ESPN claims that Tatum has begun participating in regulated basketball workouts, such as five-on-five scrimmages.:“Sources tell me Jayson Tatum has started controlled five-on-five scrimmaging with coaches. He has aggressively attacked his rehab at every turn…there’s more phases in his rehab, he has to practice with his team of course, and then again there's also the normal nerves of coming back from an injury of this magnitude, a torn achilles, in May..”He continued:“To a really good team that has aspirations to advance in the playoffs. Jayson Tatum has made clear to the people around him that he wants to come back as close to Jayson Tatum as possible, not a shell of himself, not a lesser percentage of himself....""He further added:""And the other side of all that is the Celtics’ medical staff will have to clear him 100% before he can return, and he himself will have to feel 100% confidence and trust in that leg before he makes a potential return this season..”With his co-star Jaylen Brown, who is having an MVP-caliber season, leading the charge, his teammates have come together in his absence. This does not, however, imply that Tatum should miss this season. Ultimately, Tatum has the final say over whether or not he comes back. However, he ought to come back to Banner 19 to give his squad their best chance if he is comfortable being himself.Tatum has admitted that reintegrating into a Boston club that has performed well without him could present ""challenges."" According to a later story, he was ""reevaluating"" whether to play this season or wait until 2026-2027.The Celtics want the same, Stevens said.“The best (time) for Jayson Tatum to come back is when he’s 110% healthy, he’s fully cleared by everybody that matters in that decision, and he’s got great peace of mind and he’s ready to do it,” Stevens said in his post-trade deadline news conference. “That’s it. That’s the objective, and that’s what we’re going to stick with.”When asked whether the Celtics have an internal return date for Tatum,Stevens replied: “When we feel 100%, it’ll be a group getting together and talking…”He said:“I think our medical people are really good.. I think his doctors are really good. So we’re going to listen to them. He’s listening to them. I think (trainer) Nick (Sang) and (Taum) have had an amazing work ethic throughout this whole recovery. When it’s right, then we’ll all sit down and talk about it…""He further added:""There’s still no force from us. There’s no pressure from us. But there’s also not going to be any of us saying, ‘Well, why doesn’t he just take another week?’ When he’s ready, he’s ready.”Tatum played 36.4 minutes per game in 72 games last season, averaging 26.8 points, 8.7 rebounds, six assists, and 1.1 steals. Because he could score, grab rebounds, create plays, and anchor down on defense by earning a steal almost every game, he was the engine of their offense.","Jayson tatum has met yet another milestone in his achilles rehabilitation.

George Kittle shares injury recovery details as Seahawks and Patriots chase Super Bowl history

George Kittle has no reason to cheer on Super Bowl Sunday. The San Francisco 49ers tight end is not playing, his team is out, and the two teams in the game are rivals he does not care for at all. Kittle is in San Francisco this week with his wife, Claire, for a local event. While there, he was asked about the Super Bowl being played at Levi’s Stadium. The matchup features the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots and George Kittle did not hide how he felt.“She makes me watch every Super Bowl even if I’m not in it,” George Kittle said. “I might be playing video games. I don’t know. I hope both teams lose.” That short line said everything.The comment comes after a tough end to Kittle’s season. He suffered a season-ending Achilles injury during San Francisco’s 23–19 wild-card win over the Philadelphia Eagles on January 11. The 49ers later lost to the Seahawks in the divisional round, ending their playoff run. With no team to support and still recovering, Kittle is watching the biggest game of the year from the sidelines, both on the field and emotionally.The Seahawks are trying to win their second Super Bowl title. The Patriots are chasing their first championship since the Tom Brady and Bill Belichick era ended. For George Kittle, none of that matters right now. What does matter for now is his health.During Super Bowl week, Kittle was seen using crutches. On Friday, he shared a clear update on how his recovery is going while speaking on The Pat McAfee Show.“When I’m at my house, the nice thing is my trainers are coming to me right now,” George Kittle said. “That part is really convenient. I do a lot of holds and ankle work. I have a three-inch heel lift in my boot, so I can stand and just hang out. But we are not walking yet.” He explained what comes next.“I’ll be in a shoe next week and go back and forth between a shoe and a boot,” Kittle said. “I’ll be on crutches for another two to three or four weeks. Then I’ll be moving again.”Before the injury, Kittle played 11 games this season. He finished with 57 catches, 628 receiving yards, and seven touchdowns. Despite missing time, he remained a key part of the 49ers’ offense until the injury stopped everything. For now, George Kittle is focused on healing. The Super Bowl can play on without him.",George kittle says he has no interest in super bowl lx as patriots face seahawks in epic nfl final.

Winning one Super Bowl is hard. Winning several across many seasons is even harder. Since the Super Bowl began in 1967, thousands of NFL players have suited up, but only a small group managed to win again and again. These players were part of dynasties, stayed healthy, and delivered when pressure was highest. At the very top of the list is Tom Brady, who changed what success looks like in the NFL. Behind him are defenders, kickers, and tight ends who quietly built historic careers. Today, a few active stars are also climbing this list, showing how rare long-term winning really is in professional football.Tom Brady is alone at the top with seven Super Bowl rings. He won six championships with the New England Patriots and one with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.Tom Brady’s Super Bowl wins came in Super Bowls XXXVI, XXXVIII, XXXIX, XLIX, LI, LIII, and LV. His long run of success between 2001 and 2021 set records that may never be matched.Charles Haley won five Super Bowl rings before Brady arrived. He earned titles with the San Francisco 49ers and Dallas Cowboys between 1988 and 1995.Charles Haley was known for his pass rushing and intensity on defense, playing a key role on multiple championship teams.Several players finished their careers with four Super Bowl titles. Marv Fleming won early Super Bowls with the Green Bay Packers and Miami Dolphins.Ted Hendricks won four rings while playing for three teams and became known for his size and toughness.Matt Millen earned four championships with the Raiders and 49ers.

Jordon Hudson shocking shirt and why it targeted Robert Kraft



Jordon Hudson's shocking shirt became the talk of Chapel Hill on Saturday night, and the timing could not have been louder. On the eve of Super Bowl LX, Hudson drew instant attention during North Carolina’s dramatic basketball win over Duke, not for the scoreline but for a fashion choice that landed squarely in NFL territory and reopened old New England wounds.The moment mattered because it blended sports, power, and provocation in one public setting. Hudson, the 24-year-old girlfriend of Bill Belichick, appeared courtside as the Tar Heels edged their rivals, but her outfit carried a message that extended far beyond college hoops. It pointed directly at Patriots owner Robert Kraft, just hours before his franchise prepared for the biggest game of the year.The shirt Hudson wore referenced Kraft’s February 2019 arrest on two counts of soliciting prostitution at the Orchids of Asia Day Spa in Jupiter, Florida. It was not subtle. She wore an actual Orchids of Asia Day Spa T-shirt, a detail that spread quickly online once fans identified it after the game.The choice felt calculated, especially given the history involved. Belichick coached the Patriots for 24 seasons, delivered six Super Bowl titles, and exited the organization at the start of 2024. Now at North Carolina, his first season ended with a 4-8 record, but results were often overshadowed by headlines tied to Hudson’s presence.From sideline pep talks to lingering near press conferences, her actions repeatedly became talking points around the program.Those moments never fully faded. Even in the offseason, Hudson managed to pull focus again, including an appearance at the College Football Playoff National Championship Game that fueled fresh debate. Saturday night only added to that pattern, with the shirt landing one last jab before New England faced Seattle in Super Bowl LX.The irony was hard to miss. If the Patriots lift the Lombardi Trophy on Sunday, it would mark their first championship without Belichick on the sideline. Hudson’s message, intentional or not, suggested there may be little love lost between the old power structure and the new chapter.Belichick, at least, avoided becoming the story this time. He stayed alert throughout the game, a small win after earlier viral moments at UNC. Whether he and Hudson tune in to watch his former team remains unclear. Her track record suggests neutrality is not her style.","Jordon hudson's shirt referenced robert kraft's arrest on prostitution charges.

Value vs. Volume: Stafford had the ""volume"" (46 TDs), but Maye had the ""value,"" leading a rebuilding Patriots team to a 14-3 record with a significantly weaker supporting cast.

Efficiency: Maye led the league in completion percentage (72%) and passer rating (113.5).



The ""Super Bowl"" Irony: Fans were quick to point out that while Stafford was accepting a trophy, Maye was busy preparing to play in Super Bowl LX this Sunday.



Public and Celebrity Reaction: A Split Decision

The Legends: Tom Brady and Steve Young have been vocal in their support of Stafford, calling it a ""lifetime achievement"" win for a veteran who has finally earned his flowers.



The New Guard: Younger fans and analysts argue that the MVP award should go to the ""best player that year,"" not the player with the best story.

The Meme Wars: Today, February 7th, is Stafford's 38th birthday. Memes are already circulating of him ""stealing"" the trophy as a birthday gift from the voters.

On Thursday night at the NFL Honors, the league crowned Matthew Stafford as the MVP. But while the history books will record the 37-year-old Rams quarterback as the 2025 NFL MVP, the night was defined by a razor-thin voting margin and a surprise video that reminded everyone why he’s really playing.Before Stafford took the stage to accept his trophy, the room went quiet for a surprise video. In a clip that has since racked up millions of views, Stafford’s four daughters—Chandler, Sawyer, Hunter, and Tyler surprised their dad with a homemade tribute.They didn't talk about his league-leading 4,707 passing yards or his 46 touchdowns.

He then used the massive platform to put retirement rumors to bed, confirming he will return for the 2026 season.Despite the sentimental celebration, a storm was brewing on social media. Stafford won the award by just 5 points (366 to 361), the closest margin in 22 years.The debate centers on a single vote. Analyst Sam Monson revealed he used his first-place vote on Justin Herbert (who wasn't even a top-5 finalist).Because Maye lost by only 5 points, that one ""renegade"" vote effectively decided the race.Patriots fans and ""advanced stats"" enthusiasts are calling it a robbery, citing the following:The reaction has been a perfect reflection of the close vote:Matthew Stafford goes into the 2026 season with a Hall of Fame lock, an MVP trophy, and a title he clearly values more: Most Valuable Dad.
