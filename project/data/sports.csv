Gisele Bündchen defends Tom Brady, dismisses media speculation over football’s role in the split

A quiet love story and learning to live without apology

In March 2024, Gisele Bündchen gave fans an emotionally raw glimpse into her post-divorce life during a heartfelt sitdown with Robin Roberts, reflecting on the end of her 13-year marriage to NFL icon Tom Brady. As part of the IMPACT x Nightline special Climbing the Mountain, the supermodel's tearful moment caught headlines—but beyond the emotion was a message of resilience, healing, and self-discovery.Gisele Bündchen, now 44, opened up about what she once described as “the death of my dream.” When Roberts gently revisited the quote, asking how she was coping more than a year after the split was finalized, Gisele struggled to answer before turning away and softly requesting, “Can I have a little moment?”That vulnerable pause wasn’t scripted—it was the real-time unfolding of a woman still navigating the aftershocks of letting go of a once-idealized life. And it struck a chord with fans who had watched her grace red carpets and Super Bowl stands by Brady’s side for over a decade.Following their October 2022 divorce, media speculation had pointed fingers at Tom Brady’s return to football as a key factor. But Gisele Bündchen strongly rejected that narrative in a Vanity Fair interview: “It’s the craziest thing I’ve ever heard.”Bündchen continued, “Listen, I have always cheered for him, and I would continue forever.”Despite the pain of separation, her sentiments toward Brady remained grounded in mutual respect. “If there’s one person I want to be the happiest in the world, it’s him, believe me,” she said. “I want him to achieve and to conquer. I want all his dreams to come true.”The interview at that time also hinted at Gisele Bündchen’s future—with herself and possibly with someone new. When asked if she was ready to love again, she replied with serene confidence: “Where my heart is now is where I am right now. I’m living my truth, and I’m not apologizing for it.”Behind the scenes, Bündchen had reportedly grown close to Joaquim Valente, her children’s jiu-jitsu instructor, though the relationship started as a friendship. “They’re taking it slow,” a source said at the time, noting how Valente had been a steady source of comfort during her transition.Also Read: “She is secure and happy”: Gisele Bündchen thrived after dumping Tom Brady—was the NFL legend the real problem?

Solo Sikoa defeats Jimmy Uso by pinfall.

The United States Championship belt is up for grabs once more as Jimmy Uso comes for the title, this time with Solo Sikoa defending. Sikoa won the United States Championship title from Jacob Fatu after defeating him at the WWE Night of Champions. Now the two brothers are facing each other after an already heated match on SmackDown on July 11, when a minute distraction caused Sikoa to lose the match against Jimmy during their tag team bout. After losing against Jimmy Uso and LA Knight, Sikoa was even more inclined to lay it down on his brother, and the match was exciting to say the least. The power struggle in the Bloodline, if it can even be called that anymore continues, but it's the fans who are the real winners.Solo Sikoa makes his entry alongside MFT while Jimmy Uso was waiting for him at the ring. After yesterday's fight on SmackDown, everyone is looking forward to the big match. This is Jimmy's first-ever singles match for a championship in WWE , and Solo's first-ever defense of a title. Things started out hot, with both of the wrestlers coming in hot. Jimmy almost won after jumping on Solo from the top rope, but his opponent managed to kick him off right on time.Jimmy Uso had the upper hand for most of the match, and though Sikoa tried to change the tide a couple of times, Uso was able to bring things back on track. Unfortunately, the MFT, or specifically Talla Tonga, became the reason for his defeat. Just when it seemed like Solo was going to lose, he managed to change the whole scenario. Jimmy did a corkscrew off the top onto the entire group, but Talla Tonga came in with a distraction. While Big Jim was trying to pile on the other, Solo uses this reprieve to roll Jimmy up, and Talla Tonga helped him by using his legs to keep Solo in place to take the win.Things don't end there, as Jacob Fatu makes an entrance while the MFT are taking it out on Uso. Solo had him down with a Samoan Spike, but Fatu came in to shake things up. While it's not the Bloodline, a shift is incoming, and fans are waiting to see how things turn out.Also Read: Is Roman Reigns set for a surprise return?

As the Stamford-based promotion is back again with another major event this week, with Saturday Night’s Main Event (SNME) at the State Farm Arena in Atlanta, Georgia, it has recently witnessed an intense feud between Gunther and Goldberg, where Gunther won and defended the World Heavyweight Championship title.Interestingly, the segment was WWE Hall of Famer Goldberg’s last bout, as the legend hung up his boots in Atlanta, Georgia, tonight. However, fortune did not favor the veteran wrestler as he had to face a crushing defeat at the hands of his arch-rival, Gunther. Let’s take a look at the highlights of the match now.Goldberg’s retirement bout began with thunderous applause from the fans during his entry in the ring for one last time. Goldberg's chants filled the arena in Atlanta, Georgia, by his beloved fans who gathered to watch the WWE legend one last time in the ring.The match began with the WWE Hall of Famer pushing off Gunther, who tried to lock in chops. The Ring General attacked him with two thudding chest chops, but Goldberg felt nothing as he took down the Champion with a brutal clothesline. Following this, Goldberg went for a spear, but the Champion ducked tactfully, causing him to go crashing through the barricade.Gunther next targeted Goldberg’s left knee, which everyone knew as his weak point for the seasoned wrestler. Even though he faced a tough start, Goldberg managed to break free and executed a powerful back body drop, shifting the momentum in his favor.However, out of nowhere, disaster struck when Goldberg accidentally speared the referee, bringing the match to a sudden halt. Actually. Goldberg went for the spear, but Gunther managed to duck again, and this time it's referee, Charles Robinson, fell into the deadly spear.Seizing this opportunity, Gunther capitalized again, removing the knee brace and flaunting it in front of the fans. The Ring General attacked Goldberg with the brace, and he did not stop him, hurting him physically, but added a personal twist when he taunted his son, Gage, who was watching from the ringside.Gunther, showing off his brace, climbed back into the ring, but he was taken down hard by a huge spear from Goldberg, who was eyeing the finishing move with the Jack Hammer. Just then, another referee rushed into the ring as the legend went for the pin, but Gunther managed to kick out just in time.In the final attempt, The Ring General locked in the sleeper on Goldberg, who tried very hard to fight back, but could not break himself out of the hold. The legend goes to sleep as he is unable to break the hold.

LeBron James intrigued by the Los Angeles Lakers ' futuristic vision as trade season whispers grow louder



In the midst of swirling trade speculation and mounting questions about his future in Los Angeles, LeBron James ' longtime agent, Rich Paul , has finally addressed the rumors head-on. As the Lakers pivot toward a future built around Luka Doncic and new acquisitions like Deandre Ayton, James is reportedly taking a step back to evaluate where he fits into the franchise’s evolving blueprint. With just one season remaining on his contract, the four-time NBA champion finds himself at a career crossroads, and the tension between legacy and change is more real than ever.As the Los Angeles Lakers reshape their roster with an eye toward the next decade, LeBron James is facing the most uncertain offseason of his legacy-enriched career. While the addition of Luka Doncic has sparked hope for a bright future in Los Angeles, it’s also led to speculation that the franchise may be preparing for life after LeBron.In a revealing report by ESPN’s Shams Charania, James is said to believe the Lakers ""are more in a futuristic mindset,” adding that “some hard conversations will need to happen.” Though James recently picked up his $52.6 million player option for the 2025-26 season, the decision appears more about flexibility than finality.Speaking to Charania, Rich Paul commented on where James and his team stand amid the speculation.""We understand the difficulty in winning now while preparing for the future,"" Paul said. ""We do want to evaluate what's best for LeBron at this stage in his life and career. He wants to make every season he has left count, and the Lakers understand that, are supportive and want what's best for him.""Despite averaging 24.4 points, 7.8 rebounds, and 8.2 assists last season, James and the Lakers were bounced in the first round of the playoffs for the second straight year. As front office executives Rob Pelinka and JJ Redick reshape the roster around Doncic, James has remained notably quiet.The silence has only amplified speculation. According to ESPN’s Brian Windhorst, one Eastern Conference executive is ""convinced James wanted out of LA,” with teams like the Golden State Warriors actively exploring trade packages. A potential blockbuster deal could even include both LeBron and Bronny James heading to the Bay Area in exchange for young assets like Jonathan Kuminga and Moses Moody.Meanwhile, former teammate Udonis Haslem added fuel to the fire on ESPN’s NBA Today, joking about James joining Stephen Curry. “If chef cooking up something, I’m showing up for dinner. For sure. That’s for damn sure. If chef cooking, I’m showing.""Also Read: LeBron James' Final Act? Lakers Set the Stage for a Legendary Hollywood Farewell in 2026Whether James ultimately stays or joins forces with Curry for one last title push, James is all up for retaining his legacy and retiring like a king in his potentially final season.

But as Rich Paul bluntly said on ESPN, James “values a realistic chance of winning it all.”And if the Lakers can’t offer that, the King may be ready to move on.","Lebron james is reportedly taking a step back to evaluate where he fits into the los angeles lakers' evolving blueprint.

Jerome Bettis questions Steelers' identity shift away from run-first football

Jerome Bettis on the Dan Patrick Show Full Interview | 07/10/25

Clash of philosophies between Aaron Rodgers and Arthur Smith looms large



The Pittsburgh Steelers may have made headlines this offseason by landing Aaron Rodgers and DK Metcalf, but not everyone’s convinced the glitzy moves align with the team’s traditional DNA. In fact, Hall of Famer Jerome Bettis is ringing the alarm bells—and Aaron Rodgers might be silently agreeing.Aaron Rodgers signed with Pittsburgh for what could be his final NFL season, bringing a Hall of Fame résumé and a clear philosophy: he thrives in a controlled, efficient, pass-first offense. But that clashes with what offensive coordinator Arthur Smith has planned—a ground-heavy, tight end–centric scheme that echoes old-school football more than Rodgers’ up-tempo style.Jerome Bettis, appearing on The Dan Patrick Show, didn’t hold back. When Patrick asked about the departure of running back Najee Harris and whether Rodgers changes the team’s approach, Bettis was clear: “They’re going to run the football. They drafted [a] young kid from Iowa who’s really, really good running back.”Bettis emphasized that even with Aaron Rodgers and Metcalf on board, abandoning the run game would be a fundamental mistake. “If you ask Aaron Rodgers to throw the ball 40 times, that’s a mistake,” Bettis warned.His logic? At 41, Rodgers shouldn’t be scrambling or absorbing unnecessary hits. The offense should play through the run to maximize play-action and control tempo.The tension deepens when you examine Arthur Smith’s history. Known for heavy run schemes, multiple tight end sets, and complex pre-snap motion, Smith’s system is almost the antithesis of what Rodgers prefers. The quarterback’s track record thrives in motion-light, single-tight-end, pass-heavy playbooks—a setup far from what Pittsburgh appears to be building.Even Bettis acknowledged this delicate balance: “He’s moving. He’s getting the ball out. He’s, you know, quick in the huddle, out of the huddle, running.” That doesn’t mesh easily with Smith’s grind-it-out game plans.Beyond the philosophical divide, practical concerns remain. Pittsburgh’s backfield, featuring rookie Kaleb Johnson and Jaylen Warren, is unproven. Meanwhile, the offensive line—an Achilles’ heel for Rodgers in New York—must protect its aging quarterback or risk an early collapse.Also Read: What we learned about Joe Burrow’s mindset, swagger and quirky side from Netflix’s 'Quarterback’ The Steelers’ attempt to fuse new-school talent with old-school identity could either produce fireworks—or a full-blown identity crisis.

After a week of intense back-and-forth confrontations, Seth Rollins and LA Knight finally settled their score in a must-see encounter at the event.Randy Orton picked up a win over Drew McIntyre in a one on one match, thanks to Jelly Roll. As the match reached its final moments, McIntyre got distracted by Jelly Roll at ringside, giving Orton the perfect opening to hit an RKO and secure the victory.After the match Logan Paul stormed the ring and floored Orton with a right hand, unleashing a series of punches. Jelly Roll quickly entered the ring, pulled Paul off Orton, and retaliated with a massive right hand of his own. However, McIntyre blindsided Jelly Roll with a brutal Claymore Kick and warned him that stepping into the ring made him a target. Adam Pearce, Nick Aldis, and several WWE officials rushed down to check on Jelly Roll and escort McIntyre to the back.Solo Sikoa retained the United States Championship in a wild encounter against Jimmy Uso, with crucial help from Talla Tonga. Late in the match, Jimmy nailed an Uso Splash from the top rope, nearly getting the three-count, but Sikoa kicked out just in time.Sikoa followed up with a Spinning Solo, but Jimmy avoided a Samoan Spike and fired back with a pair of superkicks. Jimmy then launched himself off the ropes to take out Talla, Loa, and Mateo at ringside. As the referee began the ten-count, both competitors made it back to the ring. Jimmy landed a stiff kick to Talla, but Sikoa capitalized, rolling Jimmy up for the pin while Talla held him down from the outside, sealing the controversial win.The action kicked off with LA Knight launching a series of strikes in an attempt to take down Rollins. However, “The Architect” quickly countered and fired back with heavy offense of his own.

He followed up with his signature flying elbow drop from the top turnbuckle, but Rollins again kicked out, refusing to stay down.Rollins retaliated with a Buckle Bomb and aimed to finish the match with a Curb Stomp, but Knight dodged just in time. Rollins then connected with a Thrust Kick and launched a springboard senton, keeping the pressure on. Knight fought back with a series of right hands, then stunned Rollins with a neckbreaker and a follow-up DDT.Later in the match, Rollins attempted a springboard Moonsault but appeared to injure his knee mid-air. He took a moment to speak with Paul Heyman and the referee as medical staff checked on him.

Toward the end, Gunther targeted Goldberg’s braced knee with a vicious kick, then tore off the brace and taunted Goldberg’s son, Gage, by holding it up mockingly. An enraged Gage struck Gunther, but security quickly restrained him. Seizing the moment, Goldberg hit Gunther with a Spear followed by a Jackhammer. As the referee rushed in and Goldberg went for the pin, Gunther narrowly kicked out.

Cam Ward and Xavier Restrepo reignite college chemistry in Tennessee



CAM WARD turns up the HEAT in Miami "" No Days Off ""

The Tennessee Titans are wasting no time reshaping their roster after a disappointing 2024 season. With a major quarterback addition in Cam Ward and a sneaky-underrated move to sign his college teammate Xavier Restrepo as an undrafted free agent, the Titans are banking on chemistry, talent, and a fresh start to spark their offense in 2025.When the Titans selected Cam Ward with the No. 1 overall pick in the 2025 NFL Draft, they signaled a bold new era for the franchise. But what flew under the radar was the team’s decision to bring in Xavier Restrepo — Ward’s go-to wide receiver at Miami — shortly after the draft. Despite going undrafted, Restrepo has a real chance to break into Tennessee’s wide receiver rotation, which currently lacks depth and established talent.Restrepo and Ward were electric together in 2024 at Miami, helping each other produce career-best numbers. Ward's pinpoint accuracy and improvisational skills thrived with Restrepo’s route-running and reliability in the slot. Their connection not only lit up ACC defenses but also helped Ward climb to the top of the draft board. Now, they’ll look to translate that success to the NFL stage.Restrepo’s journey is already off to a lively start.In a now-viral moment at Titans practice, Ward jokingly snapped at his former college teammate after Restrepo repeatedly bounced a football on the ground. “Quit throwing my ball on the ground before I beat your a**,” Ward said, captured in a July 11 YouTube vlog. The clip was all in good fun but underscored their familiarity — something that could fast-track their adjustment in the NFL.At Miami, Restrepo was known for his toughness, leadership, and consistency. His 2024 college campaign — where he flourished alongside Ward — proved he can deliver under pressure. While he may have been overlooked during the draft, the Titans are giving him the perfect environment to thrive: a familiar quarterback, a thin receiver room, and an offense in need of playmakers.Also Read: Jonnu Smith and Jalen Ramsey receive new Jersey numbers after Steelers-Dolphins NFL Trade If their college chemistry clicks in Tennessee, the Titans might have pulled off one of the smartest under-the-radar moves of the offseason — one that could help turn the page on a dismal 2024 and shape a brighter 2025.","The tennessee titans signed wide receiver xavier restrepo as an undrafted free agent.

Iga Swiatek and Amanda Anisimova will face each other in the 2025 Wimbledon women's final on Saturday, ensuring an eighth consecutive first-time winner at the prestigious tournament. Both players have reached their first-ever Wimbledon final through unexpected paths, with no player managing to defend the title since Serena Williams claimed her seventh crown in 2016.Pre-tournament favourite Aryna Sabalenka, who had reached the previous three Grand Slam finals, was eliminated in a tense semi-final match by American 13th seed Anisimova.Poland's Swiatek, seeded eighth at Wimbledon, has shown improved form recently, climbing to fourth in the rankings after reaching the Bad Homburg grass-court tournament final.The 24-year-old Swiatek has quietly progressed through the tournament, losing just one set en route to the final while other top seeds faltered. She demonstrated her newfound grass-court prowess by defeating Olympic champion Belinda Bencic 6-2, 6-0 in the semi-finals.""Honestly, I never even dreamed that it's going to be possible for me to play in the final,"" Swiatek said. ""So I'm just super-excited and proud of myself and, I don't know, tennis keeps surprising me. I've been enjoying just this new feeling of being a bit more comfortable on grass.""Swiatek has an impressive record in Grand Slam finals, winning all five of her previous appearances, with four victories at Roland Garros and one at the 2022 US Open.Anisimova, 23, secured her final spot with a surprising 6-4, 4-6, 6-4 victory over Sabalenka. Her journey to the final is particularly remarkable following an eight-month mental health break in 2023 that saw her ranking drop outside the top 400.""If you told me I would be in the final of Wimbledon, I would not believe you. It's indescribable to be honest,"" Anisimova said.""I think it goes to show that it is possible. I think that's a really special message that I think I've been able to show because when I took my break, a lot of people told me that you would never make it to the top again if you take so much time away from the game.""The American, whose parents emigrated from Russia in the 1990s, has shown strong form this year, winning the Qatar Open and reaching the Queen's Club final. Her Wimbledon performance will guarantee her first-ever top 10 ranking when updated on Monday.While the finalists have never met on the professional circuit, they played once as juniors, with Swiatek emerging victorious.""I did lose that match against her, unfortunately,"" Anisimova recalled. ""I remember a lot of coaches were saying that she's going to be a big deal one day. Obviously they were right. I'm sure it will be an amazing match. Getting to compete against an unbelievable player again is going to be super special.""Semi-final: def. Belinda Bencic (Switzerland) 6-2, 6-0Quarter-final: def.

Kevin Durant has stepped onto a fresh court in Houston, and his ambitions are more than just adding to his ring collection. Fresh from a huge seven-team trade, Durant revealed something interesting on the Mind the Game podcast with LeBron James and Steve Nash—he's not done yet.

The trade involved 13 players and a bunch of draft picks, some stretching all the way to 2032, among Phoenix, Atlanta, Brooklyn, Golden State, Minnesota, the Lakers, and Houston.

Despite the potential to earn significantly more elsewhere, the team secured these players, with long-term, team-friendly contracts, influencing their championship success. Matthew Tkachuk expressed strong approval for these crucial roster moves.The Florida Panthers pulled off a magic trick with their team, keeping key players like Sam Bennett, Aaron Ekblad, and Brad Marchand even with a tight budget. How'd they do it? Their secret weapon, which convinced these guys to take a bit less money than they could've gotten elsewhere, was their winning spirit and two Stanley Cup championships.Aaron Ekblad, a top defenseman, signed an eight-year deal for $6.1 million a year. That's a steal when he could've easily charged over $10 million! And Sam Bennett followed suit, taking an $8 million AAV over eight years, turning down potential $10 million offers. Since both wanted to keep winning, they both chose to stay. Even Brad Marchand is sticking around for another six years at $5.33 million a year.Matthew Tkachuk, one of the Panthers' stars, even with the money crunch, was absolutely thrilled about these moves.When asked if he was upset about Marchand joining, he practically flared: ""I loved it. I knew that was a guy, with Seth Jones, who could put us over the hump. Now they’re here for the next five years — Marchy, six. Two culture guys and glue guys we’re lucky to have.""He even found it funny, inserting, ""No. I find it funny that hockey players want to stay in South Florida to play hockey — and will stay for less money. That’s amazing. It’s the greatest place to play in the NHL. Hopefully we’re not stopping at two.""It really indicates how much these players believe in the Panthers' winning formula and love playing in South Florida. Tkachuk himself is locked in for eight years at $76 million, and racking up points and helping them grab those two championships, he's been a huge part of their recent success.Also Read: “Just frustrating”: Ryan Reaves slams toxic Leafs fans, says they drove Mitch Marner out of Toronto after years of loyalty Being traded from the Calgary Flames, he's been with the Panthers for three seasons since in 2022.
