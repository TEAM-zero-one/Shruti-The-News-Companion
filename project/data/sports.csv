Ajinkya Rahane reflects on KKR’s inconsistent IPL 2025, backs under-fire Venkatesh Iyer

Shubman Gill story: From a remote village near the border to India’s Test captain

NEW DELHI: Punjab Kings (PBKS) might just be on the brink of history. With a team that has often flattered to deceive in past editions, the 2025 season has witnessed a turnaround under the leadership of Shreyas Iyer . As of now, PBKS sit comfortably at the top of the Indian Premier League (IPL) points table with 19 points, having won nine matches, lost four, and shared points in one due to a no-result. Their latest statement win, a seven-wicket triumph over Mumbai Indians (MI), have booked them a place in Qualifier 1.Much of the credit for Punjab's consistency this season goes to Iyer, who has not just brought stability to the middle order but has also instilled a sense of direction within the camp. Former India international and JioStar expert Robin Uthappa , speaking on JioHotstar, lauded Iyer's journey and leadership style.""Shreyas has always been an exceptional captain,"" Uthappa remarked.""You always sensed that he felt underappreciated at KKR (Kolkata Knight Riders) despite adding value there. He moved to a franchise where not much had been achieved historically -- and then went on to win it for them. That says a lot about his leadership and belief,"" he added.Iyer's move to Punjab Kings came at a time when his place in the national side was uncertain, and questions were being raised about his long-term future in the IPL but the 2025 season has been nothing short of a personal and professional renaissance for the 30-year-old.Whether it was rotating bowlers smartly, backing youngsters like Arshdeep Singh and Prabhsimran Singh, or taking the game deep with the bat, Iyer has ticked every box.While Punjab Kings are still two wins away from lifting their first-ever IPL trophy, the air around the franchise feels different this year, more assured, more composed and with Shreyas Iyer at the helm, belief is no longer just a buzzword, it's the foundation of what could be a historic campaign.His teammate Shashank Singh highlighted the significant impact Iyer has had on the team culture and environment since taking over the reigns.""Shreyas is a dear friend. I've known him for the past 10-15 years,"" Shashank said after their match against MI at the post-match press conference.""To be very honest, playing under him, with him being the captain, is one of the best things that has happened to me,"" he added.Shashank underlined Iyer's inclusive leadership style, pointing out how the captain's approach extends far beyond the playing eleven.""The way he gives freedom to everyone, not just me, but all 25 members of the squad, including the support staff, content team, media team, logistics, it's truly commendable,"" he noted.",Shreyas iyer has led punjab kings to the top of the indian premier league (ipl) points table. The 30-year-old captained punjab to a seven-wicket win over mumbai indians. Robin uthappa and shashank singh have praised iyer's leadership style.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-121436362,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-66818,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Poll Who was the standout player in the IPL 2025 clash between Lucknow Super Giants and Royal Challengers Bengaluru? Rishabh Pant Mitchell Marsh

More Than a Team: The Rise of CSK & the Whistle Podu Army

Shubman Gill story: From a remote village near the border to India’s Test captain

NEW DELHI: Rishabh Pant rediscovered his touch in sensational fashion, smashing a scintillating unbeaten century, while Mitchell Marsh continued his purple patch to power Lucknow Super Giants to a commanding 227 for 3 against Royal Challengers Bengaluru in their IPL 2025 clash on Tuesday.Pant’s explosive 118* off 61 balls (11x4, 8x6) — his first IPL hundred in seven years — was the cornerstone of LSG’s innings, as he and Marsh (67 off 37) stitched together a game-changing 152-run stand for the second wicket. On a batting-friendly pitch, RCB’s erratic bowling only made matters worse for the visitors.Heading into the match, Pant had been under scrutiny for his patchy form — striking at just 107 this season. As LSG’s captain and wicketkeeper, his prolonged struggles had significantly dented the team's campaign.But on this night, the script flipped.Pant found his timing and rhythm with calculated aggression, striking at nearly 200. Once he abandoned the urge to over-hit, the timing naturally returned — and so did the runs.Interestingly, his standout performance came in the absence of franchise owner Sanjiv Goenka, who wasn't at the stadium to witness the carnage. But Goenka was quick to respond on social media, hailing the innings with a succinct post: “‘Pant’astic!”The southpaw’s assault began early.In the fourth over, he took Yash Dayal apart for 18 runs, including a six and back-to-back fours. That burst of intent set the tone, and his confidence rubbed off on Marsh.The Australian all-rounder started cautiously — just 19 off his first 16 deliveries — but then shifted gears with a pulled six off Romario Shepherd. From there, the man known as ‘Bison’ was unstoppable. He brought up his half-century in 31 balls with a six off Suyash Sharma, taking his season tally past 600 runs — his best-ever IPL showing.Pant too notched up his second fifty of the season in 29 balls, dispatching Suyash for two consecutive boundaries.Marsh eventually perished for 67, edging Bhuvneshwar Kumar to wicketkeeper Jitesh Sharma — RCB’s stand-in captain for the night as Rajat Patidar remained listed as an Impact Substitute.But Pant remained unflinching.He surged to his century in 54 balls, reaching the milestone with an audacious lofted four over extra cover — a vintage Pant stroke. The celebration was equally electrifying: a beaming smile followed by a trademark backflip.It was a knock that blended flair with maturity. While Pant largely stuck to classical strokes throughout his innings, the century-clinching shot was a reminder of his flamboyant best.He later added a quick 49-run partnership with Nicholas Pooran to cap off LSG’s innings on a high.Though fans may lament the timing of Pant’s return to form, with the league stage nearly complete, the knock brings hope — for LSG’s playoff ambitions and for Pant’s continued resurgence.","Lucknow super giants beat royal challengers bengaluru in ipl 2025 clash.

"Tom Brady ditches NFL life for Italian women, big money, and Raiders control after Gisele Bündchen split",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/tom-brady-ditches-nfl-life-for-italian-women-big-money-and-raiders-control-after-gisele-bndchen-split/articleshow/121414249.cms,"Tom Brady is thriving post-divorce, showcasing his influence beyond the NFL (Imagn Images)

Tom Brady thrives post-Gisele Bündchen divorce with Italian flair

Even in retirement, Tom Brady refuses to stay off the scoreboard—on or off the field. Two years after his high-profile divorce from Gisele Bündchen, the NFL legend is rewriting his own playbook, turning heads from Venice, Italy to Las Vegas, Nevada.Recently spotted throwing footballs in the narrow streets of Venice, surrounded by a group of admiring Italian women, NFL legend Tom Brady looked every bit the icon he’s always been. The seven-time Super Bowl champion seemed relaxed and energized—no pads, no stadium, just the streets of Italy and a perfect spiral. The moment felt like a metaphor for his post-NFL life: unconventional, enviable, and still centered around football.While his former partner Gisele Bündchen is forging her own path, Tom Brady’s journey since their 2023 split has been all about reinvention. Beyond becoming the most decorated quarterback in league history, he’s now a powerful media figure and NFL investor.Brady's record-breaking $375 million contract with Fox Sports made waves, solidifying him as the highest-paid sports analyst ever. His debut as a broadcaster was on the grandest stage possible—the Super Bowl—surpassing household names like Greg Olsen and Tony Romo.But Brady’s influence isn’t limited to television. As a minority owner of the Las Vegas Raiders, he’s reportedly taken an active role in shaping the team’s future. The franchise’s recent decisions—including hiring veteran coach Pete Carroll and drafting standout running back Ashton Jeanty—have Brady’s fingerprints all over them. “Tom Brady has already hit a home run with Ashton Jeanty before he takes an NFL snap,” one source noted, hinting at the quarterback's eye for talent and leadership.Also Read: Gisele Bündchen’s $400M empire: How the supermodel rebuilt her life after divorce with Tom Brady and welcomed baby no. 3 Away from the gridiron, Brady’s life has taken on a new rhythm. A single man in his 40s with no more family obligations tied to an NFL calendar, he appears to be enjoying the personal freedom he once sacrificed for football glory. Whether strolling through Venice or navigating the boardrooms of Fox and the Raiders, Brady has entered a new phase of life—one filled with power, wealth, and, perhaps for the first time, leisure.The GOAT may be off the field, but his impact on the game—and pop culture—remains as potent as ever.","Tom brady is thriving post-divorce, showcasing his influence beyond the nfl.

Steve Kerr talks about the NBA schedule

Golden State Warriors coach Steve Kerr has indicated that Stephen Curry’s hamstring injury in Game 1 of the NBA's Western Conference semifinals was a result of the tight NBA playoffs schedule, which doesn’t allow players enough time to recover from fatigue. This was Curry’s first hamstring injury in his 16-year-long basketball career and ultimately cost the Warriors the championship. He could have returned to the court to play against the Minnesota Timberwolves, but the team was eliminated too early, before even reaching Game 6.Steve Kerr told Yahoo! Sports’ Tom Haberstroh in the latter’s feature, “I think all the complaints of the wear and tear, and the scheduling, are all valid. But they all fall on deaf ears because of the dollar sign. I don’t think the league’s constituents are willing to give up any money, that’s the problem. But we all know this is not healthy or sustainable if you want guys to survive out there and not have injuries.”The feature includes a conversation Kerr had with Golden State Warriors’ director of sports medicine and performance, Rick Celebrini, about the cause of Curry’s injury.It mentions that when Kerr asked Celebrini, “Do you think Steph pulling his hamstring has anything to do with playing 48 hours after logging 46 minutes of Game 7 in Houston?” Celebrini replied, “One hundred percent. If he had an extra day or two … we can’t prove this, but I have no doubt based on our understanding of the scientific literature that the hamstring injury was the result of inadequate recovery and fatigue. ”During the playoffs, both Draymond Green and Jimmy Butler had expressed confidence in the team’s ability to succeed even without Curry, but the results made it clear that his absence came at a high cost. Amid rising expectations for his return, Curry told @andscape, “Even if I wanted to be Superman, I couldn’t.”Also Read: “They only had to win one”: Fans react after Golden State Warriors’ Playoff exit as Stephen Curry says everything was aligned for Game 6 Stephen Curry ultimately got all the rest he needed to recover from the injury.

Charles Barkley dismissed Anthony Edwards’ face of the NBA (unofficial) accolade



Face of the NBA? Of course, Minnesota Timberwolves standout Anthony Edwards ’ name pops up, but his recent Game 4 performance against the Oklahoma City Thunder raised some serious questions. Doubters, fans, and analysts quickly dismissed the long-standing claim that Edwards was the face of the NBA. NBA legend Charles Barkley was brutal in his criticism as he straightaway suggested two big names who deserved the unofficial accolade.Charles Barkley didn’t hold anything back Tuesday night when he took aim at ESPN for what he sees as the premature crowning of Minnesota Timberwolves star Anthony Edwards as the next face of the NBA. Speaking live from Indiana ahead of the Eastern Conference Finals matchup between the Pacers and Knicks, the Hall of Famer issued a stern reality check.“Hey, ESPN, I love you guys. Don’t try to make Anthony Edwards the face of the NBA,” Barkley said on NBA on TNT. “The face of the NBA is Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, [Nikola Jokic] and Giannis. You can't give it to people, they have to take it, and [SGA] is taking it.""That statement came just hours after Edwards had one of the most underwhelming games of his playoff run, scoring only 16 points in the Timberwolves’ heartbreaking 128-126 loss to the Oklahoma City Thunder.His 5-for-13 shooting night, including 1-of-7 from deep, stood in stark contrast to the performance delivered by Gilgeous-Alexander, the newly crowned 2025 MVP.In that same Game 4, SGA proved why Barkley holds him in such high regard. The Thunder guard poured in 40 points, grabbed nine boards, dished out ten assists, and snagged a steal, leading OKC to a 3-1 series lead. While not flawless from the field (13-of-30 shooting), his presence was undeniable and decisive.Despite Edwards’ rising profile, he’s a three-time All-Star, a two-time All-NBA Second Team member, and has led Minnesota to back-to-back Western Conference Finals. His recent struggles, however, raise questions about whether he's ready to lead the league both on and off the court.Back in February, when asked if he saw himself becoming the face of the league in the post-LeBron James era, Edwards responded with humility, saying, “Nah, not really. That’s what they got Wemby for.” His answer surprised many and seemed to contradict the ESPN-driven narrative that he’s next in line.Also Read: Anthony Edwards is rewriting NBA playoff history with insane Game 4 numbers Of course, Barkley’s message wasn’t anti-Edwards; it was a reminder of what it takes to truly earn that status. The players he named, Nikola Jokic, Giannis Antetokounmpo, and Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, have all taken their moment, backed it with MVPs, and proved it on the biggest stages.","Charles barkley slams espn for calling anthony edwards the face of the nba.

Draymond Green responded to a heckler but it has sparked divided reactions from his fans



Draymond Green, one of the most popular and talented players of the Golden State Warriors might have lost to the Minnesota Timberwolves a few days back but the star player has constantly proved his worth on the court. Draymond Green was recently spotted at the Madison Square Garden alongside Shaquille O'Neal, Charles Barkley, Kenny Smith, and Ernie Johnson to cover the Eastern Conference Finals between the New York Knicks and the Indiana Pacers but he soon got into a verbal feud with a fan and it has sparked divided reactions.Recently, a video of Draymond Green interacting with a fan outside Madison Square Garden has gone viral. The video shows Draymond Green being surrounded by fans when a fan started screaming, “Cancun! Cancun! How was Cancun?”The video showed Draymond Green being shocked when he heard this but he quickly gave it back to the fan as he screamed, “Can you afford to go?” but now, this has divided fans.Many believed Draymond Green was trying to show off his wealth. A fan commented, “When an athlete has to flex their money, that’s when they already lost the argument”, while another fan wrote, “If he can afford Knick playoff tickets pretty sure he can afford to go.”A third fan wrote, “If dude can afford to go to a Knicks playoff game then Cancun is easy work.”Another user posted, “Costs like $1000 bucks to get into the garden after service fees, im quite sure buddy spent his cancun money watching the knicks go down 2-0, draymond”However, other fans support the way Draymond Green responded to the hecker.A fan commented, “Draymond coming in hot with that savage clapback.

Carl Davis’ athletic limitations are evident at 33 years old

Carl Davis is showing veteran consistency inside, says Washington Commanders head coach Dan Quinn

Washington Commanders were ranked 13th in total defense in the 2024 NFL season. This screamed for an urgent roster update. And they just announced that update! “Who?”- a fan asked on their X account. The Commanders have signed 33-year-old defensive tackle Carl Davis. Another fan pointed out, “Not mad about it, just wish it didn’t require dropping Jonathan Allen.”According to Scott Jennings from SB Nation Hogs Haven, a Washington Commanders community, Carl Davis wasn’t a priority signing or a starter, but he provided depth later in the season as the team dealt with Jonathan Allen’s injury. Davis was signed to the practice squad three days after Allen’s pec injury and was active for three games during the regular season and during the NFC Championship game when Daron Payne was inactive.33-year-old Carl Davis has been to several NFL teams since his 2015 NFL Draft. First, it was the Baltimore Ravens that drafted him. In his third year of his four-year rookie contract, Davis was waived off by the Ravens in 2018. He entered the Cleveland Browns to finish the last year.For a while, he played for the Indianapolis Colts before shifting to the Jacksonville Jaguars in 2019. Then, in 2020, he played for the New England Patriots for two years from 2020 to 2022.In 2023, Davis became a practice squad member for the Seattle Seahawks. The same year, the Dallas Cowboys signed him for a one-year deal worth $ 1.4 million. But in August 2024, the Cowboys released him.Then, the Washington Commanders entered Carl Davis’ life in October 2024, but he became a practice squad member there. In the 2024 NFL season, Davis played for the Commanders in three games, where he recorded 3 tackles. Davis has accumulated 71 tackles, 2.5 sacks, 3 passes defended, and 1 fumble recovery in 78 career NFL games.According to Dean Jones, Site Expert and Qualified Journalist at Riggo’s Rag, the Washington Commanders brought back a familiar face in the form of Carl Davis. He joined the club last season, playing three games and logging 23 percent of the team’s defensive snaps when active.The former third-round pick out of Iowa is a decent asset against the run. His athletic limitations are evident at 33 years old, but Washington saw enough in the player to warrant another look as preparations gather pace.On May 27, Commanders head coach Dan Quinn shared with David Harrison, Staff Writer at Sports Illustrated,“He’s really showing that veteran consistency inside. He can play square. He’s got size. Getting him into the mix and going, it was right to put that competition up for it. And so, he’s delivered on those ones. We’ve been pleased (with) what we’ve seen so far.”","33-year-old carl davis has been to several nfl teams since his 2015 nfl draft.

Russell Wilson’s reaction to Ciara’s bold AMAs dress proves he’s her biggest fan



Ciara has never been one to shy away from the spotlight, but her recent appearance at the American Music Awards in Las Vegas proved once again that she knows how to own a red carpet moment—with or without her husband, Russell Wilson, by her side. The 39-year-old singer stunned in a glittering, crystal-embellished dress that had fans and followers buzzing on social media. And while she may have walked the red carpet solo, her NFL star husband didn’t hesitate to let the world know how he felt.Taking to Instagram, Ciara shared a video of her jaw-dropping entrance, captioning it, “Every time I come around ya city… bling bling :) 💎.” The clip, set to Shirley Bassey's timeless “Diamonds Are Forever,” featured her strutting confidently in a figure-hugging, partially see-through gown adorned with dangling crystals and metallic accents. Completing the look with platform heels, stacks of chain necklaces, and flawless blonde waves, Ciara radiated star power from every angle.Russell Wilson, clearly captivated, responded with a heartfelt comment: “No one better. Love you Mrs. Wilson. 👑 @ciara ❤️.” His admiration for his wife’s bold fashion choices isn’t new—it’s part of the couple’s ongoing love story that fans adore. From joking about baby number five when Ciara wore a fierce “lioness” look to Carnival, to his playful complaints about her spicy dance moves, Wilson’s affection has become a beloved fixture in their public appearances.Their bond has always been celebrated, and even when they appear together—like at the recent Knicks vs. Pacers game where they matched in denim—it’s Ciara who often steals the show. Her fashion sense consistently balances edgy with elegance, and her AMAs look was no exception.While Ciara didn’t perform during the awards show, she took the stage to present, later changing into a bold, furry blue ensemble that further highlighted her playful approach to style. As one fan wrote online, “She is everything Russ thinks and says she is!!!” Another added, “This is how you show skin and look classy!”Beyond just looking good, Ciara continues to embody the spirit of a confident, stylish woman unafraid to take risks. Whether she’s in Cannes turning heads or commanding attention in Las Vegas, her fashion choices are as iconic as her music. And with Wilson cheering her on—sometimes a little too enthusiastically—Ciara’s spotlight doesn’t seem to be dimming anytime soon.Also Read: “WHERE TF IS TAYLOR SWIFT?”: Taylor Swift accused of misleading fans after skipping AMAs and staying silent on ‘Reputation (Taylor’s Version)’","Ciara stunned in a crystal-embellished dress at the american music awards.

OMG! Taylor Swift & BF Travis Kelce hit the red carpet at the 2025 American Music Awards

While Taylor Swift is getting heat and fan dismay after a total snub at the 2025 American Music Awards, her boyfriend, Travis Kelce , is quietly enjoying time off the grid — and it's not being overlooked. The Kansas City Chiefs' tight end found himself at the center of a viral phenomenon when fans started asking, Where is Travis Kelce today?The American Music Awards 2025 generated controversy on social media when Taylor Swift—in six categories—went home winless. But while Swift avoided the limelight, the internet zeroed in on another central character in her life: Travis Kelce.With Swift missing the event and her romance with Kelce regularly in the foreground of fan discussions, the question “Where is Travis Kelce today?” started trending on platforms such as X and TikTok. The answer? Florida.Kelce was seen last weekend on a low-key outing with his dad, Ed Kelce, in Boca Raton. The pair spent the day at the Restoration Hardware store and were snapped exiting the building. Wearing loose-fitting summer gear — brightly patterned shorts, a white T-shirt, and a red cap — Kelce seemed to be getting a rare break from his intense training regimen.In contrast, Ed Kelce did not overdo it with black shorts, a dark T-shirt, and a brown sun hat. The look provided a short but intimate look at the tight end's off-field, out-of-office life without football or media distractions.Earlier that weekend, Kelce and Taylor Swift also dined together at a posh restaurant in West Palm Beach, where the couple reportedly spent about $400 on their dinner. Swifties were quick to notice that Donna Kelce—Travis's mom—had liked a post featuring photos of the couple's night out, quietly indicating her approval.Back in the NFL, Kansas City Chiefs head coach Andy Reid disclosed in an interview with The Athletic last month that Kelce has been ""training like crazy"" to gear up for what might be his last NFL season. Although the tight end hasn't said anything about the award show or Swift's snub, his not attending major public events only heightened fan intrigue.Also read: Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce fuels break up rumors as she looks miserable during their date night While Travis Kelce has remained mum as Taylor Swift goes through an unusually disappointing night at the awards, his low-profile appearance in Florida says everything about the way the couple is going about letting attention pass them by.
