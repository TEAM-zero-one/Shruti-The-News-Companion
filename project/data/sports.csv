NEW DELHI: Pakistan set up another politically charged clash with arch-rivals India after securing a 41-run win over the United Arab Emirates in Dubai on Wednesday. The result confirmed both teams’ progression from Group A into the Super Four stage of the Asia Cup.With the win, Pakistan finished the group stage with 4 points from 3 games, slotting in alongside India, who top the standings with 4 points from 2 games and are yet to play Oman on Friday. Hosts UAE (2 points from 3 matches) and Oman (0 from 2) bowed out of the tournament.While Group A is settled, Group B remains wide open.Sri Lanka currently lead the standings with 4 points from 2 games and a strong net run rate (+1.546). Bangladesh sit second with 4 points from 3 games but a negative NRR (-0.270), leaving their fate in the hands of other results.Afghanistan, meanwhile, hold 2 points from 2 games with an impressive NRR (+2.150) and will face Sri Lanka in a decisive clash on Thursday. Only Hong Kong, winless in three outings, have been eliminated. The final Group B fixture will determine which two teams join India and Pakistan in the Super Four.On the field, Pakistan endured a shaky start against UAE before Fakhar Zaman’s 50 (36 balls) and Salman Agha’s 20 steadied the innings. Shaheen Shah Afridi’s late cameo of 29* lifted Pakistan to 146/9. UAE pacer Junaid Siddique impressed with 4-18, while Simranjeet Singh claimed 3-26.In reply, UAE managed just 105 in 17.4 overs. Abrar Ahmed (2-13), Shaheen (2-16) and Haris Rauf (2-19) dismantled the hosts’ batting, with only Rahul Chopra offering resistance with 35.The fixture began an hour late due to Pakistan’s ongoing dispute with match referee Andy Pycroft after the controversial handshake row with India.

Brock Purdy injury dilemma looms large as 49ers prepare for Cardinals showdown,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/brock-purdy-injury-dilemma-looms-large-as-49ers-prepare-for-cardinals-showdown/articleshow/123974306.cms,"Brock Prudy (Getty Images)

Brock Purdy’s progress offers hope but raises questions about timing

Mac Jones and team depth show resilience in Brock Purdy’s absence

The San Francisco 49ers are off to a perfect 2-0 start in the 2025 NFL season, but their early momentum has been clouded by injury concerns to some of their biggest stars. Quarterback Brock Purdy and tight end George Kittle headline a growing list of key players dealing with setbacks, leaving head coach Kyle Shanahan to strike a delicate balance between caution and competitiveness.Brock Purdy, who has been central to the 49ers’ resurgence since 2022, sat out last week’s win against the New Orleans Saints with a turf toe and shoulder issue. “He returned to practice on a limited basis,” Shanahan confirmed, signaling optimism that Purdy could be available for Sunday’s divisional clash with the Arizona Cardinals.The 49ers know Purdy’s value stretches far beyond stats. Since taking over as starter, he has brought stability to an offense that had previously shuffled between Trey Lance and Jimmy Garoppolo. His leadership has guided San Francisco to a 24-13 record, an NFC top seed, and earned him a long-term contract extension. With his proven ability to rally the team, the temptation to fast-track his return is high.The offseason addition of Mac Jones proved timely in Week 2, as he stepped in under center and helped the 49ers maintain their undefeated record. While Jones delivered a steady performance, the team’s offensive ceiling is clearly higher with Purdy on the field.San Francisco is also awaiting the return of Kittle and wideout Brandon Aiyuk, both vital to maintaining offensive rhythm. If Purdy can start against Arizona, his presence—alongside the return of other playmakers—could set the tone for a strong playoff push.Also Read: ""Not A Big Deal"": Ben Johnson shrugs off Tom Brady conflict of interest talk ahead of Bears-Raiders Week 4 clash For Shanahan, the key lies in not rushing Purdy back too soon.

My Opinion On This Mock Trade: A High-Risk, High-Reward Trade Deadline Prospect

Thefind themselves in a precarious position at third base in 2025. Projected starter Mark Vientos has struggled with injuries and inconsistency, while Brett Baty has yet to live up to expectations. This has left the Mets urgently seeking a game-changing bat.Enter- a proven All-Star with postseason pedigree and consistent offensive production. With reports linking the New York Mets to a possible blockbuster pursuit of Bregman, analysts believe such a move could reshape their lineup and playoff outlook.Alex Bregman, who signed a three-year, $120 million contract with Boston in early 2025, has opt-out clauses that could make him available before the offseason if extension talks stall. The New York Mets are now positioned as a leading candidate to acquire him, with trade rumors heating up as the deadline nears.A prominent trade proposal involves the New York Mets sending outfielder Starling Marte and top pitching prospect Nolan McLean (ranked No. 4 in their system) to Boston in exchange for Alex Bregman.• Starling Marte: Provides veteran leadership, a strong bat, and championship experience. His defensive versatility adds further value for the Red Sox.• Nolan McLean: A highly regarded pitching prospect with strong upside, offering Boston a long-term developmental piece.From Boston’s perspective, this package balances short-term competitiveness with future growth while offloading Bregman’s sizable contract. For the Mets, it represents an immediate solution at third base.Before suffering a quad injury earlier this season, Bregman was hitting .299 with an .839 OPS and 11 home runs, proving he remains in peak form. That kind of production is exactly what the New York Mets’ corner infield has been missing.• Mets: Gain a premier third baseman with proven postseason chops, immediately strengthening their playoff push while addressing a glaring hole in the lineup. This also helps mitigate uncertainty around Pete Alonso’s long-term future.• Red Sox: Offload a contract worth $80 million over the next two years (with opt-outs) while adding a veteran outfielder and a top prospect, giving them financial flexibility and depth.• Starling Marte: Lands in Boston with a chance to rejuvenate his career and help push the Red Sox toward contention.• Nolan McLean: Receives a clearer path to MLB action in an organization with room for pitching growth.• Alex Bregman: Joins a contender in the Mets, positioning himself for another deep postseason run while escaping Boston’s contract uncertainties.This table highlights the delicate balance: while both teams benefit in different ways, each must also accept notable risks.This comparison underscores Alex Bregman’s clear offensive superiority while also revealing the cost for New York in terms of prospects and salary commitment.If executed, this trade has the potential to be a win-win. The Mets stand to benefit most by addressing their biggest roster weakness with an elite talent, potentially boosting their World Series odds. The Red Sox gain flexibility, roster balance, and prospects, softening the blow of losing a superstar.Much depends on Alex Bregman’s health following his quad injury. If he returns to form, the New York Mets emerge as big winners. If not, they risk absorbing a massive financial commitment without payoff. Boston’s success hinges on Marte’s ability to contribute and McLean’s development.In the high-stakes world of MLB midseason trades, the New York Mets’ pursuit of Alex Bregman is one of the most intriguing storylines. Supported by Bregman’s track record and New York’s urgent positional needs, the move could transform their postseason outlook.Also read: Rumor Mill: Philadelphia Phillies Weigh $20 Million Contract Decision on Harrison Bader After Breakout Run For Boston, the trade offers a chance to reset financially and retool with new talent.

Travis Kelce faced another brutal loss as Taylor Swift deals with her security concerns



Taylor Swift has always been very concerned about her safety and has mostly missed away games of Travis Kelce’s Kansas City Chiefs due to security concerns. With yesterday’s match being the Chiefs’ first home game of the season, fans were expecting to catch a glimpse of Taylor Swift. But many were left disappointed but fans feel it is because of what might have happened to Charlie Kirk and the other gun violence incidents that happened over the last few days.According to FOX Sports, Taylor Swift did arrive at the Arrowhead Stadium to cheer on Travis Kelce but the billionaire pop star used a large movable wall to sneak into the stadium.Now, fans are very concerned about her safety. A fan by the username @wompingwillowx wrote, “anyone unable to tell this is for her safety is either really dense or mentally immature. she isn’t hiding behind a bullet proof barrier for an easter egg. like bffr. everything that happened last week, people are insane. she wanted to go watch her fiancé in peace and safety.”Another fan by the username @roadnoz wrote, “After what happened this week with all the shootings I’m sure their taking extreme measures for her safety.”A third fan by the username @yeswhaleswiftie posted, “Also not a single camera, at least from what I’ve been watching, has even TRIED to sneak a peak of her in that suite.Shows that this has been discussed by a lot of people and it’s probably for her safety.”·Another fan by the username @humcupcake wrote, “I hate to even bring this up, but do we think this could be about enhanced security due to everything that has been happening?”A fifth fan by the username @LilySunday noted, “It is to do with security. People have no idea the threats this woman receives. Dare say her security team have required this.”However, neither Taylor Swift nor Travis Kelce have addressed the billionaire pop star’s security concerns as they continue to lead their lives privately.Yesterday was not a good day for Travis Kelce, as his team ended up facing another brutal loss on the field against the Philadelphia Eagles; this being the second consecutive loss for the team after their first loss against the Los Angeles Chargers.With the season just beginning, it would be interesting to watch how the power couple tackle their security concerns, while also planning their high profile wedding. As per reports, there are speculations of the wedding happening next summer, but there has been no confirmation from the couple yet.

Dalton Kincaid’s journey from Nevada to the NFL spotlight



The Canadian heritage behind the helmet decal

Dalton Kincaid has quickly emerged as one of the Buffalo Bills’ most reliable weapons in the passing game. The tight end, known for his athleticism and catching ability, carries more than just his NFL aspirations on his helmet—he also displays the Canadian flag alongside the American stars and stripes, sparking curiosity about his connection to Canada.Born on October 18, 1999, in Las Vegas, Dalton Nevada, Kincaid didn’t start playing football until his senior year of high school, after friends convinced him to join the team. Prioritizing basketball until then, he quickly proved himself on the gridiron, racking up 745 yards and eight touchdowns in a single season.His early success earned him a spot at the University of San Diego, where he totaled 1,209 yards and 19 touchdowns in just two seasons before transferring to Utah. In the Pac-12, Kincaid continued to dominate, showcasing the skills that would make him a first-round pick in the 2023 NFL Draft after the Bills traded up to secure him.While Kincaid was born and raised in the U.S., he qualifies for dual citizenship through his mother, Vicki, who hails from Sarnia, Ontario. The city sits on Lake Huron near the Michigan border, just an hour from Detroit, giving Kincaid a unique North American connection.Whether or not he visits Canada frequently, the Canadian flag represents a meaningful part of his identity. For fans crossing the border to watch Bills games in Buffalo, it’s a nod to their shared heritage.Also Read: Josh Allen’s insane stats against Miami Dolphins prove why he remains Buffalo’s ultimate weapon in rivalry clashes In 31 games (21 starts) for Buffalo, Kincaid has tallied 125 receptions for roughly 1,200 yards and five touchdowns.

Mike McDaniel under fire after Dolphins’ winless start



Dolphins’ ownership continues to back Mike McDaniel



The Miami Dolphins are staring at a troubling 0-2 start, and the pressure is mounting ahead of their primetime clash with the Buffalo Bills. With one of the league’s weakest showings in both scoring and defense so far, the team finds itself under intense scrutiny. At the heart of the discussion is head coach Mike McDaniel, who is now in his fourth year leading the Dolphins but still searching for postseason success.McDaniel’s tenure has been a mix of promise and frustration. His first three seasons delivered two playoff berths, but not a single postseason win. The Dolphins have consistently trailed the Bills in the AFC East, and this year’s rocky start has only fueled doubts about how long he will remain in charge.A crushing Week 1 defeat to the Indianapolis Colts raised alarm bells, and another setback against the Patriots left Miami desperate for answers. Entering Week 3, they are heavy underdogs against a Bills team considered among the league’s Super Bowl contenders.Still, analysts caution that Thursday’s result may not immediately decide McDaniel’s future. ESPN’s Peter Schrager noted, “If you get blown out tonight, it’s not good and there will be people calling for McDaniel’s head.If you lose to the Jets in Week 4 and start the season off 0-4 and losing on national TV two weeks in a row... that’s when we really start talking about this.”For now, owner Stephen Ross appears to be standing firmly behind his coach. NFL insider Ian Rapoport reported, “[Stephen Ross] does not want to fire Mike McDaniel, he doesn’t. He wants this to work – he likes him, he believes in him, he has invested in him, including a contract extension last year.”That loyalty comes with conditions. If players stop responding to McDaniel or fans begin to turn away, the pressure could quickly escalate. Yet, according to NFL Network’s Cameron Wolfe, the locker room has not lost faith: “No one expressed panic and no one said they’ve quit on their head coach.”Miami showed signs of improvement in Week 2, battling the Patriots closely before mental mistakes cost them the game. With upcoming matchups against the Jets and Panthers, opportunities exist to turn the tide. For now, McDaniel’s job appears safe, but continued losses could push this story in a very different direction.Also Read: Who is Tua Tagovailoa’s wife Annah Gore?

Easton Cowan ’s development sets stage for Maple Leafs training camp spotlight



The challenge ahead: Can Easton Cowan secure his place with the Maple Leafs?



When the Toronto Maple Leafs hit the ice for training camp this week, one name is bound to dominate conversations—Easton Cowan. The 20-year-old forward has been turning heads ever since his breakout season with the London Knights, where he piled up accolades, lifted the Memorial Cup, and proved himself as one of the brightest young stars in Canadian hockey. Now, the question isn’t about his potential—it’s about timing.Cowan enters camp with the kind of momentum most prospects can only dream of. Last season, he didn’t just score—he led, showcasing maturity and work ethic that stood out even in pressure-filled playoff moments. That’s exactly the kind of pedigree the Maple Leafs need as they reshape their forward group following Mitch Marner’s departure. Cowan’s blend of offensive creativity, vision, and willingness to battle in tough areas makes him a natural candidate to compete for a roster spot.The offseason was no vacation for Cowan. He spent the summer adding muscle and refining his defensive game, arriving in Toronto at 5-foot-11 and nearly 190 pounds. That commitment to improving away from the puck has only heightened his stock. As Cowan himself has said, being relentless on the forecheck and dependable defensively is the fastest way to unlock his offensive upside at the NHL level.Earning a job in Toronto won’t come easy. The Maple Leafs are deeper at forward than they’ve been in years, and every shift in camp will be a proving ground.Cowan must show he can handle the speed, physicality, and consistency demanded of an NHL regular. Still, his adaptability and fearless style could separate him from other prospects fighting for the same opportunity.Even if he starts the season with the Marlies, Cowan is poised to be one of the first call-ups when the Leafs need reinforcements. His story has quickly shifted from promising junior to legitimate NHL hopeful, and training camp is the stage where he can make that leap.For Maple Leafs fans, Easton Cowan isn’t just another prospect, he’s a glimpse of the future , and that future might arrive sooner than expected.Also Read: Connor McDavid’s wife Lauren Kyle hosted star-studded charity Poker night backing kids for Oilers Youth Foundation","Toronto maple leafs prospect easton cowan has been turning heads ever since his breakout season with the london knights.

Poll With Seville's victory, how do you see Jamaica's future in sprinting? Bright and promising Uncertain without Bolt Other countries will dominate It will remain competitive

Jamaica’s Oblique Seville finally fulfilled his promise on Sunday, winning the men’s 100 metres title at the World Athletics Championships in Tokyo, timing 9.77 seconds. The 24-year-old edged out renowned sprinters, including American Noah Lyles, the defending world and Olympic champion, and Jamaican teammate Kishane Thompson, to claim the gold.For Seville, the victory was the culmination of years of near misses. He had finished fourth at the 2022 and 2023 World Championships and made the semi-finals of the Covid-delayed Tokyo Olympics. Despite posting two Diamond League wins over Lyles this season, global glory had eluded him. “All the guys I competed with are very strong, so I have to maximise what I can do,” Seville reflected. He added that injuries had hampered his fitness in previous seasons, limiting his potential.Seville’s journey began in rural Jamaica, near Ness Castle, where poor roads did not prevent him from exploring sports. At Calabar High School, he played cricket and football and enjoyed swimming, but track and field ultimately became his focus. A huge influence on his career has been sprint legend Usain Bolt , whom Seville describes as “my motivator”. Bolt’s guidance has been invaluable, offering advice both on life and sprinting.Now coached by Glen Mills, Bolt’s former mentor, Seville said he felt privileged to be under Mills’ tutelage. “We all watched Usain Bolt as kids! I wanted coach Mills to be my coach… He’s a very intelligent man,” Seville said. Bolt still occasionally visits training sessions, offering insight and encouragement, particularly after the death of Seville’s father. “Since my father passed away, Usain’s my motivator,” he added.Seville also highlighted the bright future of Jamaican sprinting. Before his win, he had predicted a resurgence led by himself, Ackeem Blake, and Kishane Thompson. With Sunday’s triumph, Jamaica claimed its first men’s 100m world title in ten years, the last being Bolt in 2015. “We have a great level… All of the US athletes are over 25, so in the future we are going to be on top again,” Seville said.","Jamaica's oblique seville won the men's 100 metres title at the world athletics championships in tokyo.

The Chicago Blackhawks are opening up a training camp on Thursday, following a busy week of rookie camp and the Tom Kurvers Prospect Showcase. The excitement now shifts to the young players on the roster, ready to join practice with the older players.As per reports, young standouts will join established veterans in preparation for the 2025-26 NHL season. It will include Connor Bedard, Frank Nazar, and Alex Vlasic. But, beyond these marquee names, training camp will offer an opportunity to the veterans, such as Ryan Donato, Andre Burakovsky, Teuvo Teravainen, Nick Lardis, and more. Let’s take a closer look at the lineup of the veterans and rookies who are going to join the team this season.One of the veterans that fans should expect to watch out for this season in the Chicago Blackhawks is Ryan Donato, who inked a contract extension this summer before hitting free agency, and is all set to join his first career 30-goal season. According to reports, it is said that he thrived in Chicago last year, and management is banking on his consistency as a key offensive contributor.While repeating 30 goals may be something very big for him, however, the team is expecting Ryan Donato to play a pivotal role in the Blackhawks’ attack.Moreover, his conditioning and form during camp will be closely watched so that he can work on his loopholes and prepare to build on a breakout campaign this season.Another player who is joining Donato is Andre Burakovsky, a two-time Stanley Cup champion . It is to be noted that Burakovsky has set foot in Chicago after a long hiatus, battling injuries and inconsistencies in Seattle. The training camps will provide the first glimpse at how he’s adapting to his new surroundings and what he can offer as a stabilizing presence following his long gap from gap.Teuvo Teravainen is again returning to Chicago with valuable experience and skill. He has consistently been one of the team’s most reliable performers last season. Now entering camp, he’s aiming to secure his place as a top-six spot while also making a case for Olympic selection with Team Finland. This season, it is expected that Teravainen will showcase his ability to complement Chicago’s fast, youthful core and prove he remains a difference-maker at the NHL level.Nick Lardis is one of the rookies whom the team is really counting on. After an impressive season in the OHL where he scored a jaw-dropping 71 goals, Lardis has emerged as one of the most promising young talents in the organization. His strong showing at rookie camp has raised the bar, and this season, he will need to prove his expertise in games against NHL-level competition. Although he will start in the AHL, a standout performance in camp could just land him a spot on the opening-night roster.Joining him, Marek Vanacker will also appear as a rookie following a major injury that sidelined him a year ago. Vanacker closed last season with a stint in the AHL and is expected to spend more time there in 2025-26. At this training session, his performance will indicate how close he is to breaking through. If he impresses, fans may not have to wait long to see his NHL debut.","The chicago blackhawks are opening up a training camp on thursday, following a busy week of rookie camp and the tom kurvers prospect showcase.

Tense faces! Pakistan cricket team arrive at ICC Academy | Will they boycott Asia Cup?

Poll Should Saim Ayub be dropped from the starting XI due to his batting form? Yes, he needs to be replaced No, he should be given more chances

NEW DELHI: Pakistan set up another high-stakes clash with arch-rivals India in the Asia Cup after a 41-run win over the United Arab Emirates in Dubai on Wednesday. But amid the victory and the off-field dramas, all eyes were on young opener Saim Ayub, whose poor run with the bat continued.The 23-year-old left-hander registered his third straight duck of the tournament — following scores of 0 against Oman and India — when he was dismissed cheaply again against the UAE. While Pakistan’s bowlers and Fakhar Zaman ’s 50 off 36 balls bailed the team out, questions are mounting over Saim’s place in the XI.Former Pakistan captain Rashid Latif, however, urged patience and defended the youngster, highlighting that Saim has been contributing with the ball. “Kabhi kabaar aisa hota hai, banda oont pad baitha hai aur kutta kaat jata hai, uske saath yahi ho raha hai [Sometimes it happened, the guy is sitting on camel and dog bites him anyhow],” Latif remarked, using a colourful metaphor to describe the batter’s lean patch.“Woh kaha par catch hokar out ho gaya... kabhi yu maara toh out ho gaya, kabhi aise mara toh out ho gaya. Bura time aata hai sabka. Yeh bowling se apne team me khel raha hai.Bade match me kissi me fodega. ya toh phoot jaega ya phod dega [He is getting out playing different shots. Bad phases come for everyone. He is in the team for his bowling currently. But he will explode in big games],” he added, predicting that Saim will either fail spectacularly or come good in a big game.Saim’s right-arm spin has already fetched six wickets in three games — 2/8 vs Oman, 3/35 vs India, and 1/18 vs UAE — a key reason behind his retention despite batting failures.With Pakistan and India both securing qualification from Group A, fans will not have to wait long to see if Latif’s prophecy comes true, as the arch-rivals clash again in Dubai on Sunday.",Pakistan beat united arab emirates by 41 runs in asia cup.

Jason Kelce’s evolving fashion sense wins playful praise from Kylie Kelce



Kylie Kelce is opening up about her husband’s evolving style and the hair choices that sparked both admiration and frustration over the years. On the latest episode of her podcast, Not Gonna Lie with Kylie Kelce, the 33-year-old shared which looks she adored on Jason Kelce, 37, and the one haircut she could barely stand.Answering a fan question, Kylie revealed that Jason’s look has stayed true to himself since the early days of their relationship. “He had long hair when we first started dating. He had the man bun,” she recalled, adding that he eventually cut it because “he couldn't comfortably put his head back on the sofa.” For Kylie, that style worked. “I'll tell you what. He looked very good with a man bun,” she said.The mother of four admitted that Jason also pulled off a clean fade, saying, “he looked damn good with a fade.” Photos online, she added, prove that he looked “great with a man.”But not every haircut earned her approval. “I will say the one, which we were already married, the one haircut he knows that I came very close to shaving his head in his sleep. Full transparency was the mullet,” Kylie confessed. While she joked that Jason might have done it just to annoy her, she begrudgingly admitted, “he kinda made it look good.”Beyond hairstyles, Kylie pointed out how Jason’s fashion has shifted. “It’s gotten a little funky,” she said with a laugh, highlighting his bold Bluey-themed two-piece outfit from an Amazon Port panel in June. “To be able to make that a thirst trap? You kidding?”Jason himself explained his choice at the event: “It’s Father’s Day, so I figured I’d embrace my inner child.My girls would appreciate this outfit, for sure.”Together, Jason and Kylie are raising four children—Wyatt, 5, Elliotte, 4, Bennett, 2, and baby Finn, just 4 months. For Kylie, watching her husband’s style evolve has been equal parts entertaining and endearing, even if the mullet still haunts her memory.Also Read: Jimmy Kimmel’s explosive feud with Aaron Rodgers over Epstein resurfaced before ABC axed his late-night talk show",Kylie kelce says jason kelce’s worst haircut drove her close to secretly shaving his head at night.
