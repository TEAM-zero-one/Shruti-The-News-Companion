Brittany Mahomes chooses Travis Kelce over Patrick Mahomes in Chiefs night out

Brittany Mahomes enjoyed a concert night out with Travis Kelce and friends, while her husband Patrick Mahomes and Kelce's partner Taylor Swift were not present in all shared photos. This outing showcased the strong comradery among the Chiefs' extended circle beyond football.Although the Kansas City Chiefs push through their preseason minicamp, key players like quarterback Patrick Mahomes and tight end Travis Kelce are in rigorous coaching.

She initially shared a video capturing a sweet, relaxed moment with her husband. However, what truly caught the attention was a picture featuring Brittany surrounded by friends, with Travis Kelce among them. Noticeably absent from this particular photo were Patrick Mahomes and Kelce's acclaimed partner, Taylor Swift.This casual gathering came to existence shortly after Kelce and Swift's high-profile appearance at the Stanley Cup Final, making Swift's absence from this concert all the more remarkable to fans.Brittany, embracing the chance for a different kind of social engagement, seemed to appreciate the time spent with Kelce and their mutual friends. It appeared to be a favourable time for them to relax, far from the usual pressures of their football and ‘parenting duties. ’As for Patrick and Brittany Mahomes, family remains a central pillar, especially with ‘three young children at home.’ They handle the complexities of the demanding NFL schedule alongside their significant ‘parenting’ responsibilities. Still, they understand the value of withdrawing personal time to refresh and reconnect.Their night out discreetly highlights the close-knit bonds that extend beyond the football field within the Chiefs organization. These relationships, embracing teammates and their families, form a quiet but vital component of the team's culture as they aim for ""another championship run.""Kelce, in particular, maintains a consistent presence within the Mahomes family circle, underscoring the depth of their friendship. While Taylor Swift's absence was noted by fans, this specific evening truly underscored the deep “camaraderie that exists within the Chiefs circle,” demonstrating how these connections reach ""beyond the field and into everyday life.""Also Read: While Taylor Swift is away, Travis Kelce and Brittany Mahomes share unexpected off-duty bonding moment Moments like these, whether celebrating victories, offering support during stringent seasons, or simply enjoying ""time at a concert,"" serve to emphasize the powerful relationships flourishing within the Chiefs' inner network.",Brittany mahomes enjoyed a concert night out with travis kelce and friends.

NBA world reacts to Indiana Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton’s heartbreaking injury



It was the worst of times for the Indiana Pacers. Tyrese Haliburton has sustained a devastating leg injury during the NBA Finals Game 7 decider. After his injury, several NBA stars and legends reacted to the heartbreaking blow the Indiana Pacers had to face. While it was inevitable, as he has been battling the leg injury since Game 5, Haliburton wanted to give a fast fight for the championship, but his injury left the team in a crushing position, giving the OKC Thunder the edge to a stunning lead in the fourth quarter. Sadly, the Pacers lost Haliburton just before the halftime lead, and the momentum of the game changed afterwards.Game 7 of the NBA Finals between the Indiana Pacers and the Oklahoma City Thunder took a devastating turn early, shaking the very core of Indiana’s title hopes. Just under five minutes into the first quarter, Pacers star Tyrese Haliburton went down with a right lower leg injury and was helped off the court in visible pain. The injury not only silenced the arena but also sent shockwaves through the NBA community as Haliburton’s playoff run came to a sudden and emotional end. Several NBA stars reacted to the incident.New York Knicks star Josh Hart also took to X to respond to the heartbreak of the Pacers, “Ty 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽,” he write on the platform.Hart’s teammate Karl-Anthony Towns also sends his prayer, “You never want to see that, prayers up 🙏🏽.”NBA legend Vince Carter wrote, “Damn man smh 🙏🏽🙏🏽🙏🏽.”NBA analyst Stephen A. Smith wrote, “Awwwws Damn! @TyHaliburton22 is down. @TyHaliburton22 is down. Awww damn! None of us want to see this. We don’t want a title decided this way. Especially the way he was playing!!!! Awwwww Damn!!!!!”As Indiana's offensive engine and vocal leader, Tyrese Haliburton's absence was immediately felt on the floor. The Pacers, who had leaned on his playmaking and leadership throughout their Finals push, were left scrambling to adjust on the fly.The team later confirmed the diagnosis on social media, stating Haliburton had suffered a “right lower leg injury.” Given the timing and the stakes, the loss could not have come at a worse moment for Indiana.With Haliburton sidelined, all eyes turned to the Eastern Conference Finals MVP Pascal Siakam.Also Read: LeBron James drops one-word NSFW reaction to Tyrese Haliburton’s lower leg injury as Indiana Pacers fight to stay alive in NBA Finals Game 7","Indiana pacers star tyrese haliburton went down with a lower leg injury in the first quarter of game 7 of the nba finals.

Micah Parsons eyeing record-breaking Cowboys contract while family members stir heat on Jerry Jones,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/micah-parsons-eyeing-record-breaking-cowboys-contract-while-family-members-stir-heat-on-jerry-jones/articleshow/122007593.cms,"Jerry Jones' old habits under fire as Micah Parsons' brother speaks out amid contract standoff (Getty Images)

Cowboys star Micah Parsons nearing massive $200M deal as his brother fuels off-field firestorm



As the Dallas Cowboys gear up for training camp next month, all eyes are on Micah Parsons. The franchise’s defensive cornerstone has already committed to attending, but what’s unclear is how involved he’ll actually be. With his contract situation looming large, the team faces a potentially season-defining decision. And the stakes? They’re historic.Parsons, arguably the most explosive edge rusher in the NFL today, is staring down a deal that could make him the highest-paid non-quarterback in league history. Cowboys insider Mike Fisher didn’t mince words, stating, “It’s inevitable and it’s almost inarguable. Micah is going to sign the richest-ever non-QB contract in NFL history.” According to Fisher, the expected figure exceeds $200 million over five years — a contract that would place Parsons in a financial tier of his own.But every day Dallas delays, the price tag ticks upward. The original $40 million annual projection is now old news. With players like Myles Garrett and Maxx Crosby already setting new baselines and T.J. Watt’s potential extension on the horizon, the market is shifting rapidly.Industry whispers already place Parsons’ ask between $45–50 million per year — a figure that could balloon further if Dallas doesn't act swiftly.Despite skipping OTAs, Parsons returned for mandatory minicamp. Yet he was quick to remind the Cowboys front office that stalling could cost them. And his brother, Terrence Parsons Jr., added fuel to the fire with a subtle yet stinging retweet. It read: “The craziest thing about the cowboys building a CHAMPIONSHIP roster… they really will be like 2-3 pieces away and be like nah we cool … let’s wait til next year and see what we can find 😭. ” Terrence’s one-word response? “This.”That frustration isn’t unique. It echoes across Cowboys Nation, a fanbase tired of waiting for a front office to take the leap. Dallas, after all, hasn’t won a Super Bowl since 1995 — when Friends was the hottest show on TV and Tupac was still alive. The ghosts of Troy Aikman, Emmitt Smith, and Michael Irvin haunt every roster move today. Even Aikman recently admitted, “They’re going to contend and be stronger than they’ve probably gotten credit for up to this point. ”Still, the roster feels frozen in a state of “almost.” Despite Dak Prescott closing in on franchise passing records and Parsons posting an eye-popping 52.5 sacks in just 63 games, the team keeps falling short — like a perfectly built Madden squad stuck in eternal conference championship limbo.Now, the Cowboys find themselves in familiar territory. The franchise has been here before — drawing out high-stakes negotiations with Dak, with CeeDee Lamb — waiting, betting on leverage, and ultimately paying more after tensions rise. The whispers suggest Jerry Jones could be holding off not because of indecision, but to reap roughly $332,000 a month in interest by stalling the payout. But while the numbers may impress on a spreadsheet, they’re alienating a generational talent.Parsons, on a $24 million fifth-year option, could opt for a “hold-in” — showing up to camp but not participating fully. It would be a strategic move, a signal that the clock has run out on patience.Terrence’s tweet isn’t just brotherly support. It captures the spirit of every fan who’s had enough of “next year.” When you’ve got a player like Parsons — a transcendent force capable of transforming the defense and elevating the entire franchise — hesitation becomes a liability.The question isn’t whether the Cowboys can pay him. It’s whether they’re ready to finally act like a team chasing a championship — not just their past glory. The clock is ticking, and Oxnard awaits.Also Read: ""Still got cheated on by his wife"": Shirtless at 47, Tom Brady flexes shredded physique and fans bring Gisele Bundchen reference","Micah parsons could be the highest-paid non-quarterback in nfl history.

Poll How do you feel about the overall performance of the Indian team in the first two days? Dominant and impressive Good, but needs improvement Disappointing performance

NEW DELHI: Day 2 of the India vs England 1st Test at Headingley brought high drama, stellar performances, and a flood of hilarious memes, as Jasprit Bumrah led India’s bowling charge with sheer menace.Despite India posting a formidable 471, it was England’s gritty response, and Bumrah’s brilliance, that stole the spotlight and the internet’s imagination.Ollie Pope anchored England’s innings with a fighting century, finishing unbeaten on 100.But his knock wasn’t without fortune. Surviving a fiery opening burst from Bumrah, Pope narrowly avoided lbw, was dropped twice, and edged several deliveries into no-man’s land.The crowd may have held their breath, but social media had its own way of reacting, with memes poking fun at dropped catches, missed chances, and Bumrah’s almost-too-good-to-be-true spells.Bumrah was a one-man demolition crew, accounting for all three English wickets, removing Crawley in the first over, then dismantling Duckett’s stumps, and later nicking off Joe Root Yet, perhaps the most dramatic moment came when he had Harry Brook caught in the final over, only for the delivery to be called a no-ball.Social media lit up instantly with reactions, likening Bumrah’s overstepping to tragic love stories and unfinished revenge plots.As Headingley saw fluctuating fortunes under moody skies, online, it was clear: Jasprit Bumrah not only lit up the field but also broke the internet.Day 3 promises more action, but Day 2 undoubtedly belonged to Bumrah and the memes.","India bowled out england for 471 on day 2 of the 1st test at headingley.

NFL wives allegedly snubbed Camille Kostek over marriage status



Camille Kostek had to bend NFL rules for love—her secret first date with Rob Gronkowski



Camille Kostek, widely known for gracing the pages of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit, has peeled back the curtain on what life was really like as the girlfriend of NFL star Rob Gronkowski. In a heartfelt conversation on Kristin Cavallari’s Honestly Cavallari: The Headline Tour, Kostek didn’t shy away from discussing the judgment she faced behind the glitz and glam of being with a professional athlete.The 33-year-old model revealed she felt dismissed by other NFL wives simply because she wasn’t married. “I felt like I was seen as a lesser-than girlfriend because I didn’t have a ring on my finger,” she admitted during the live show in Boston. Her honesty resonated even more as she added, “But you want to know what’s so interesting about that? The woman that’s coming to mind [who] judged me the most, she’s divorced.”Camille and Gronk’s relationship dates back to 2015, though their first encounter happened in 2013, when she was a Patriots cheerleader and he was already a rising tight end with the team. From that moment, their connection grew stronger, but not without facing a few storms.“Rob and I met when I was 21 years old, and we’ve been in each other’s lives for 10 years,” she shared.Camille Kostek’s first date with Rob Gronkowski wasn’t just memorable—it was borderline covert. While speaking at Super Bowl 2025 in New Orleans, the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit star shared a behind-the-scenes look at how their relationship started under strict boundaries set by the NFL.Back in 2013, when Gronkowski was in his third year with the New England Patriots, and Kostek had just joined the team’s cheerleading squad, romance was off-limits. But the connection between them couldn't be ignored. “Our first date was very undercover because I was a cheerleader for the New England Patriots and you’re not allowed to date the players but I was a bad girl,” Kostek said. “We went to the movies at Patriot Place in the lux level and we went with our hoodies up. ”Their relationship, which began after a charity event, had to be hidden from the start. Despite the early secrecy, the couple eventually went public in 2015 and have since become one of the most beloved pairs in sports entertainment.Today, what started as a rule-breaking romance has blossomed into a strong, enduring bond—proving that sometimes, the best love stories start with a little rebellion.Also Read: Leaked emails shed light on Jordon Hudson’s role in Bill Belichick’s controversial CBS appearance","Camille kostek opens up on rule-breaking romance with gronk.

The injury sent shockwaves through the Pacers' bench. Virtually the entire Indiana squad, including players, coaches, and trainers, gathered around him on the court.The loss of their floor general mid-game added a layer of emotional intensity to the Pacers’ already uphill battle. “It’s a heartbreak, man,” Pacers center Myles Turner told Salters during an in-game interview. “It’s unfortunate... but we’ve got his back.”Also Read: James Harden stuns fans by dressing as WWE legend Hulk Hogan at Fanatics Fest showdown Despite the earlier calf strain that had been bothering him since Game 5, Haliburton had made it clear he wasn’t going to miss Game 7. “If I can walk, I want to play,” he said—an attitude that now defines both his season and his heart.

Poll Was Rishabh Pant's dismissal a turning point in the match? Yes, definitely Possibly Not really No, it didn't matter

Yashasvi Jaiswal credits Shubman Gill after maiden Test ton in England: 'I love it'

NEW DELHI: Team India's vice-captain Rishabh Pant lit up Day 2 of the Headingley Test not just with his bat, but also with his words.In a now-viral video, Pant was caught on the stump mic saying, “Suja diya yaar maar maar ke, ek hi jagah maare ja raha hai” — roughly translating to, “He’s made me swollen, man, just by hitting the same spot again and again!”The comment, directed at partner Ravindra Jadeja , came right after an aggressive phase of his innings.Watch:Ironically, Pant was dismissed on the very next ball, pinned lbw by Josh Tongue after shouldering arms to a delivery that nipped back sharply.Despite the dismissal, Pant’s 134 (off 178 balls) was a masterclass in controlled aggression, featuring fearless strokeplay and tactical brilliance.Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar later praised Pant’s unusual “falling paddle sweep”, calling it “intentional and extremely clever”.According to the legendary batter, the shot allowed Pant to scoop the ball with precision over leg slip, especially effective against Bashir.Tendulkar also pointed out the strategic mid-over conversations in Hindi between Shubman Gill and Pant, suggesting they were designed to disrupt the young spinner’s rhythm.Gill and Pant’s 209-run stand was the cornerstone of India’s imposing 471-run total, following Yashasvi Jaiswal’s fluent 101. Gill’s composed 147 and Pant’s flamboyant ton put England’s attack under severe pressure -- until both fell within quick succession, triggering a collapse.While India lost their last seven wickets for just 41 runs, Jasprit Bumrah ensured they stayed in command with a three-wicket burst, including the vital scalp of Joe Root. But Ollie Pope ’s gritty unbeaten 100 kept England in the game at 209/3.","India's vice-captain rishabh pant lit up day 2 of the headingley test.

NEW DELHI: Pakistan men’s hockey team made headlines after a gripping victory over France in the FIH Nations Cup semifinal, but it was captain Ammad Butt’s Instagram post that truly ignited the internet.Following their 3-2 shootout win in Kuala Lumpur, Butt shared a controversial story reading “Rafael down again” -- a remark many saw as a dig at India, alluding to recent military tensions involving French-made Rafale jets.Though the post was swiftly deleted, screenshots had already gone viral, stirring a wave of debate.Many online users, especially from India and Pakistan, interpreted the comment as blending sports triumph with political and military history, further amplifying tensions between the two nations.On the field, the match was a thriller. France led 2-1 by the third quarter, but Pakistan mounted a spirited comeback.Waheed Ashraf equalised and then scored again, only for France to level in the dying seconds. The shootout saw Pakistan's goalkeeper Muneeb ur Rehman shine, saving three attempts, while Afraz, Hanan Shahid, and Waheed scored to secure the win.The green shirts now head to the final against New Zealand, aiming for their first major title in years.But Butt’s provocative post shifted some focus away from their gritty performance to a heated social media discourse.Meanwhile, India’s men’s team continues to falter in the FIH Pro League.They suffered a 3-6 loss to Belgium, marking their seventh consecutive defeat.Despite flashes of promise -- goals from Dilpreet Singh, Mandeep Singh, and Amit Rohidas -- India's defensive lapses cost them dearly.Their World Cup qualification hopes now hang by a thread after a disappointing European campaign.With Pakistan climbing and India struggling, the emotional undertone in South Asian hockey has rarely felt more intense, both on and off the field.","Ammad butt mocks india after beating france in the fih nations cup semifinal.

Poll Do you think flamboyant celebrations like Pant's should be encouraged in cricket? Yes, they bring excitement. No, they distract from the game.

Yashasvi Jaiswal credits Shubman Gill after maiden Test ton in England: 'I love it'

NEW DELHI: Rishabh Pant has never been one to stick to the script, and he proved that once again at Headingley with a celebration as electrifying as his innings.After notching up his seventh Test century in classic Pant style, charging down the track and launching Shoaib Bashir over deep midwicket for a towering six, the India vice-captain stunned fans and teammates alike with a surprise somersault celebration.The move, equal parts flamboyant and athletic, quickly set social media ablaze and became the highlight of Day 2 of the first Test between India and England.While Pant’s acrobatics wowed viewers, they also drew amused and admiring reactions from former cricketers and teammates.In a video shared by BCCI, Dinesh Karthik quipped, ""Neither could I do the somersault like him, nor can I bat like him. When I was very young, my parents made me try gymnastics, and I was an utter failure. So let's just leave it there because he's doing it so much nicer when he celebrates it.""Former head coach Ravi Shastri also praised Pant's unexpected flair: “At a very young age, he did a lot of gymnastics. He does it really well. I think it was unique. No one expected him to do that. Nothing wrong with it — though if I tried it, I’d probably end up in a swimming pool!” Cheteshwar Pujara , typically reserved, summed it up simply: “Rishabh being Rishabh.He does something unique.”Pant’s celebration mirrored one he had pulled off during the IPL earlier this year, but seeing it on the Test stage added a new level of surprise. His innings — a blistering 134 off 178 balls with 12 fours and six sixes — came at a crucial time, forging a vital partnership with Shubman Gill (147) to push India beyond the 400-run mark.As fans marvelled at the shot-making, it was the flip that stole the spotlight — a moment that perfectly encapsulated Pant’s spirit: fearless, fun, and fiercely unforgettable.","Rishabh pant scored 134 off 178 balls with 12 fours and six sixes.

India lose momentum on Day 2 | England Fight Back at Headingley

NEW DELHI: Shubman Gill burst into an animated celebration after Mohammed Siraj dismissed Joe Root during a crucial phase of the match. The Indian Test captain charged toward Siraj, pointing at him in a way that clearly signaled their well-executed plan had worked perfectly. But the joy was short-lived. Root immediately reviewed the decision, and the DRS showed a faint edge was missing — the on-field call was overturned, and the former England skipper survived.Watching Gill’s exuberance, former India batter Sanjay Manjrekar couldn’t help but draw comparisons. He said Gill’s reaction reminded him of someone familiar — someone who used to bat at No. 4. Without naming him, the hint was obvious: Virat Kohli “Who is this — Shubman Gill or someone else?” Manjrekar said on air.“When he bats, he seems so calm, composed — a completely different personality. Captain Gill, we are seeing this version for the first time. His celebration… it reminded me of someone, but I’m struggling to place it. MS Dhoni never celebrated like that from mid-on, and it’s definitely not Rohit Sharma ’s style. Could be a No. 4 batter... My third guess would be Ajit Wadekar,” he added, sparking laughter in the commentary box, with Varun Aaron and Navjot Singh Sidhu joining in.Gill’s day wasn’t just about fiery reactions. It was also a record-setting one.The 24-year-old became only the fifth Indian to score a century on Test captaincy debut, joining the elite company of Sunil Gavaskar, Virat Kohli, Vijay Hazare, and Dilip Vengsarkar. His composed 100 came off 140 balls, laced with 14 boundaries, anchoring India to a strong position.This match also marked the start of the 2025–27 World Test Championship cycle for both teams, and Gill made the occasion count. He also crossed the 2,000-run milestone in Test cricket, achieving the landmark in his 60th innings — the same match in which Virat Kohli also reached 2,000 runs during his captaincy debut.Gill now becomes the 23rd player to score a hundred in his first Test as captain, and the fourth youngest to do so, behind Herbie Taylor, Alastair Cook, and Steve Smith.His act in the commentary box led to big laughter among other commentators, including Varun Aaron and Navjot Singh Sidhu.Gill joins the elite list of Indians, which includes Sunil Gavaskar, Virat Kohli, Vijay Hazare and Dilip Vengsarkar to score 100 on Test captaincy debut. This is also the start of the 2025-27 World Test Championship (WTC) cycle for both nations.Gill also completed 2000 runs in Test cricket, the batter took 60 innings to achieve this feat. Both Shubman Gill and Virat Kohli completed 2000 Test runs in their first match as captain.Gill is the 23rd player to score a century in a debut innings as captain and the fourth youngest among those behind Herbie Taylor, Alastair Cook, and Steven Smith.Gill brought up his 100 in 140 deliveries in an innings peppered with 14 boundaries as he kept India steady.","Shubman gill becomes fifth indian to score a century on test captaincy debut.

I took her to the place where I started playing cricket. We were here only (somewhere along Marine Drive apparently). She had brought food from home. We ate it. So, I was just sitting. Then I told her let's go out to eat ice cream, I'm bored. Then we took the car out, we left. We left from Marine Drive, crossed Haji Ali, Worli. So, she asked where is the ice cream shop? She does not know anything after Bandra. I told her there's a good one in Borivali, where I live. You've never come, so let me show you,"" Rohit shared during the conversation.The cricket captain continued describing the actual proposal moment at the ground.""It was a ground and it was pitch dark and she didn't realise it was a ground.Then I had already told my friend to set up something there at the ground and just be there to capture the moment. We parked the car. Then I went on my knees, in the middle of the pitch. Then, I proposed to her,"" Rohit revealed.The revelation comes amid significant changes in Rohit's cricket career, as he recently announced his retirement from T20 internationals following India's victory in the 2024 T20 World Cup held in the West Indies and the USA.In May 2025, Rohit also stepped away from red-ball cricket, making the announcement just before the squad selection for the England Test series.Quiz: Who's that IPL player?

India’s first Test against England at Headingley is turning into an instant classic — packed with big runs, sharp banter, and Jasprit Bumrah ’s record-breaking brilliance under cloudy skies.Day 2 saw India finish their imposing first innings at 471, anchored by Rishabh Pant ’s sparkling seventh Test century. But the momentum wobbled when the visitors lost their last seven wickets for just 41 runs. England, however, responded strongly, reaching 209/3 at stumps, with Ollie Pope steadying the innings with a classy hundred and Ben Duckett chipping in with a fighting 62.While the runs kept coming, the stump mic served up a bonus treat for fans:Pant, after a dramatic diving stop to save leg byes, quipped:Captain Shubman Gill was fired up too, pumping up Jadeja from mid-off:The drama continued on Day 3 as England pushed on to 465, closing the first innings just six runs behind India despite some sloppy Indian fielding as four catches were dropped off Bumrah alone. Still, India’s ace pacer turned up the heat, bagging a brilliant 5/83, his 14th Test five-for, equalling Kapil Dev’s record for most five-wicket hauls by an Indian in away Tests. He also became the bowler with the most five-wicket hauls in WTC history (11).Quiz: Who's that IPL player? With the ball swinging under overcast skies, India’s second innings had its own jitters.

International Olympic Committee's (IOC) incoming president Kirsty Coventry and outgoing president Thomas Bach will honour each other at Monday's handover ceremony in Paris, with both acknowledging Juan Antonio Samaranch Senior's crucial role in saving the Olympic movement from potential extinction, transforming it into a financially robust organisation during his presidency from 1980 to 2001.Coventry and Samaranch Senior share a background of serving in controversial regimes before their IOC roles. Coventry served as sports and arts minister in Zimbabwe's government, whose 2023 election was deemed unfair by international observers, while Samaranch held a high position in General Francisco Franco's fascist Spanish regime.Samaranch Senior's presidency faced scrutiny during the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics votes-for-favours scandal, yet his contributions to the Olympic movement remain significant.""His legacy is that we have an Olympic Games to talk about,"" former IOC marketing executive Terrence Burns told AFP. ""He saved it from financial and political ruin.""After Franco's death and Spain's return to monarchy, Samaranch Senior became ambassador to the Soviet Union, acknowledging his political career in Spain had ended. He consistently maintained he was not a fascist.His election as IOC president occurred during the 1980 Moscow Games, which were affected by boycotts following the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.Former IOC marketing chief Michael Payne emphasised Samaranch's impact: ""Within the IOC I think the Samaranch legacy is fully understood: that he saved the Olympic Movement.""Payne highlighted Samaranch's success in developing the business model, including television strategy and the TOP programme, which became the most successful sports marketing program ever.According to Payne, Samaranch Senior was more introverted than his son, who recently finished second to Coventry in the IOC presidential election.""He was very introverted, a great listener, didn't do a lot of talking, and a great strategic thinker,"" said Payne. ""But because he wasn't at the forefront, communicating and explaining, he was often misunderstood. He only learned English as his third or fourth language when he was 60.""Samaranch's leadership during the Salt Lake City scandal demonstrated his resilience, resulting in six members' expulsion and implementation of reform measures.""He was calm under unbelievable pressure and stress,"" Payne recalled. ""Honestly, you went to the office every day and you didn't know if the organisation would survive... And that was for three months. It was brutal. And yet, Samaranch Senior displayed absolute calm, focus.""In a rare moment of vulnerability, Samaranch told the Los Angeles Times in 2000: ""Retiring myself after the Barcelona Games (in 1992), I could have been a hero, no? I cannot regret. I have to write my history again.""Samaranch demonstrated his tough negotiating skills when Greece opposed the Olympic torch lighting for the 1984 Los Angeles Games due to commercialisation concerns.""Samaranch sent one of his relatives to Olympia to privately film the lighting of the flame, put it in a miner's lamp, and brought it back to Lausanne,"" Payne revealed. ""Then Samaranch called the Greeks and said, 'just for you to understand, I now have the Olympic flame on my desk. Either you will agree to let the Americans come and properly light it or there will never be another torch lighting in Olympia. Because it will be lit at the Olympic Museum in Lausanne. ' So he wasn't shy of being very tough.""",Juan antonio samaranch sr. helmed the ioc for 21 years (1980 until 2001) his presidency faced scrutiny during the 2002 salt lake city winter olympics votes-for-favours scandal.
