“ARE YOU INSANE?”: NHL fans blast Florida Panthers over outrageous Game 6 ticket prices ahead of potential Stanley Cup win,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nhl/news/are-you-insane-nhl-fans-blast-florida-panthers-over-outrageous-game-6-ticket-prices-ahead-of-potential-stanley-cup-win/articleshow/121885018.cms,"Florida Panthers face criticism for high ticket prices for Game 6 of the Stanley Cup Finals (Getty Images)

With prices topping $3,000, fans question if loyalty is being priced out of the Stanley Cup Finals experience





The Florida Panthers are on the verge of making history, but for many fans, the cost of witnessing a potential back-to-back Stanley Cup victory in person is nothing short of shocking. As the team prepares to host the Edmonton Oilers in a decisive Game 6 at Amerant Bank Arena, a wave of backlash is building over the sky-high ticket prices for the marquee matchup.According to a post by Five Reasons Sports on X (formerly Twitter), ticket prices for Game 6 are starting at a staggering $944 and climbing well beyond $3,000 for premium seating. While upper-level seats remain just under the $1,000 mark, fans are finding it difficult to justify the hefty price tags. The caption on the viral post summed up the sentiment: “It’s a bit pricy to watch the Panthers win another Stanley Cup…”Many fans are choosing to support their team from home or bars rather than shell out thousands. One user echoed this frustration, writing, “I saw that this morning and decided I’ll be watching from home or at a bar.” Another added sarcastically, “Bruh what? Is Messi playing or something?”—highlighting the disbelief over the pricing for a hockey game.One Oilers fan shared, “Flying down from Vancouver with row 1 club seats. Weren’t cheap,” while another seemed resigned to both the financial hit and a loss, writing, “Well, all those ppl are going to be disappointed.”""Husband: we could get $5k for our 2 seats and pay for next year if we sell them Me: ARE YOU INSANE? There’s a number but knowone would pay it for me to not go to game 6 lol"", another commented.This isn’t the first time NHL teams have come under fire for capitalizing on historic or emotional moments. Earlier this year, the New York Islanders faced backlash for charging $45 to print digital tickets during Alex Ovechkin’s record-breaking goal night.Also Read: “Sick of this sh*t”: Alex Wennberg’s wife slams Donald Trump’s ICE raids after heartbreaking video from Texas goes viral Now, with emotions high and stakes higher, the Florida Panthers are being accused of turning their championship run into a luxury experience, leaving many longtime supporters feeling left out.

Ron Taylor cause of death: How the former member of Mets' 1969 World Series team passed away?,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/mlb/news/ron-taylor-cause-of-death-how-the-former-member-of-mets-1969-world-series-team-passed-away/articleshow/121896477.cms,"Ron Taylor, World Series Champion Turned Team Doctor, Passes Away at 87 (Michael Karas/NorthJersey.com)

Dr. Ron Taylor died Monday at age 87 in Toronto after a lengthy illness







Ron Taylor, a two-time World Series champion and one of the key relievers behind the New York Mets’ unforgettable 1969 title run, passed away on Monday at the age of 87 after a prolonged illness. Known for his poise under pressure and dedication to excellence, Taylor’s contributions extended far beyond the mound.During his 11-year MLB career, Taylor wore the jerseys of five different teams—Cleveland, St. Louis, Houston, New York, and San Diego. It was with the St. Louis Cardinals in 1964 that he first experienced championship glory. But his most iconic moment came in 1969 with the ""Miracle Mets.""Taylor was a steady presence in the Mets’ bullpen from 1967 to 1971, posting a 3.04 ERA, 1.14 WHIP, and securing 50 saves over 269 games. In the 1969 season, his performance peaked. He led the team with 59 appearances, recording 13 saves and a 2.72 ERA. One of his defining moments came in Game 2 of the World Series against the heavily favored Baltimore Orioles. With two runners on base, Taylor coolly retired Hall of Famer Brooks Robinson, sealing a critical 2-1 win for New York.“Ron was the only guy on our staff with postseason experience,” teammate Art Shamsky reflected in a statement issued by the Mets.“He had won a championship with the Cardinals in 1964 and brought a winning mentality. We don’t win the title without Ron Taylor.”After his retirement from baseball, Taylor chose a path rarely taken by professional athletes. He returned to Canada and enrolled in medical school at the University of Toronto, earning his degree in 1977. By 1979, he found his way back into baseball—this time as the Toronto Blue Jays’ team physician, a position he held for more than three decades.Taylor’s legacy was celebrated with his induction into the Canadian Baseball Hall of Fame in 1985. He later became part of two more World Series-winning teams as a physician during the Blue Jays’ back-to-back titles in 1992 and 1993.Ron Taylor’s life was a rare blend of athletic excellence and medical service—a legacy that leaves a lasting mark both on and off the field.Also Read: MLB reveals first All-Star vote results with Aaron Judge and Shohei Ohtani dominating early fan support","Ron taylor, a two-time world series champion and one of the key relievers behind the new york mets’ unforgettable 1969 title run, passed away on monday at the age of 87.

With the 2025 MLB All-Star Game set for July 15 at Atlanta’s Truist Park, the excitement is already heating up—and it’s New York Yankees slugger Aaron Judge and Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani who are stealing the spotlight. According to the first update from Phase 1 of the All-Star voting released on Monday, both players are leading their respective leagues with massive vote counts.Aaron Judge, who has been in red-hot form this season, leads all of Major League Baseball with 1,568,527 votes. If his top position holds until June 26, when Phase 1 concludes at 12 p.m. ET, he’ll become the first back-to-back overall vote leader since Alex Rodriguez achieved the feat in 2007 and 2008. Close behind is Ohtani, who sits atop the National League with 1,398,771 votes. With just under a month left, the gap is tight, and a last-minute surge could tip the balance.“The leading vote-getters for the American and National League when Phase 1 finishes will automatically get starting spots in the All-Star lineups, bypassing the next round of voting,” MLB confirmed.Shohei Ohtani isn’t alone in the million-vote club.He’s joined by Dodgers teammates Freddie Freeman and Will Smith, as well as the Cubs’ Pete Crow-Armstrong and the Mets’ Francisco Lindor.

NBA Trade Rumors: NBA insider spilled beans on how Kevin Durant’s trade outlook shifts after Desmond Bane joins Orlando Magic,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nba/top-stories/nba-trade-rumors-nba-insider-spilled-beans-on-how-kevin-durants-trade-outlook-shifts-after-desmond-bane-joins-orlando-magic/articleshow/121888262.cms,"Kevin Durant.

Desmond Bane’s blockbuster trade could reshape Kevin Durant’s market value

Desmond Bane's shocking trade to the Orlando Magic has caused ripple effects far beyond the Eastern Conference playoff picture. According to league insiders, the deal not only enhances Orlando's firepower but also shifts the perception of trade value across the league, particularly for highly talked-about stars like Kevin Durant. As teams gauge the market, comparisons to Bane’s trade package are forcing executives to reevaluate how much it will actually take to acquire a player of Durant’s caliber.After the Magic landed Desmond Bane in exchange for Kentavious Caldwell-Pope, Cole Anthony, and four first-round draft picks— plus a pick swap— front offices around the league started taking notice. Though Bane has never made an All-Star team, the return Memphis got for him was massive. One executive told ESPN, “Everyone has to throw their prior precedents and baselines out.”The source made it clear that recent deals, including the one that sent five first-rounders to Brooklyn for Mikal Bridges, shouldn’t be used as a template for valuing Kevin Durant. “Those deals don't mean Durant is worth 12 firsts now,” the executive added. The point being: while Bane’s value is high, Durant’s situation is far more complex.Durant, 36, is certainly one of the most skilled scorers in NBA history. However, age, injury concerns, and a massive contract complicate his trade value. According to ESPN’s Shams Charania, Durant is open to a contract extension with three teams— the Houston Rockets, Miami Heat, and San Antonio Spurs. Despite that short list, the Minnesota Timberwolves continue to be linked to him by league insiders.Any potential package going to Phoenix isn’t expected to top what Memphis got for Bane. That reality could shape how Phoenix approaches the situation and whether Durant is moved at all this summer.Meanwhile, Orlando's acquisition of Bane signals a serious shift in ambition. “Over his five years in the NBA, Desmond has distinguished himself as one of the elite guards in our league,” said Magic president Jeff Weltman. “We look forward to his shooting, IQ, and wide-ranging skill set.”Bane, who averaged 19.2 points per game while shooting 39% from three this season, is exactly the kind of player Orlando lacked. The Magic ranked last in the NBA in both three-point shooting percentage and makes per game, a major flaw for a playoff team looking to contend.Also Read: Orlando Magic make major jersey number change for Desmond Bane after blockbuster trade with Memphis Grizzlies While the Magic get sharper, the Durant saga raises several questions.

Top NHL teams in the Western Conference could pursue Mitch Marner







The NHL offseason buzz is centered on Toronto Maple Leafs forward Mitch Marner, and his teammates may have already revealed the biggest clue. Several Leafs players reportedly believe Marner’s next destination lies out West, away from the pressure cooker of Toronto and the emotional ties to the Eastern Conference.As NHL insider Elliotte Friedman recently shared, the belief in the Leafs locker room is that Marner wants a full reset, and a Western Conference team would offer just that. While the Carolina Hurricanes have shown interest, Friedman downplayed their chances, pointing instead to a desire for a clean break and long-term distance from his current team.Since entering the league, Mitch Marner has carried both the hopes and frustrations of Toronto Maple Leafs fans. Postseason disappointments and salary cap debates have often overshadowed a skilled playmaker and top-line winger, Marner’s regular-season consistency.The attention and pressure from the Canadian hockey market have seemingly taken a toll. After years of scrutiny, Marner is now believed to be craving something the Leafs can no longer provide, freedom from expectations.As trade talks heat up, several NHL teams in the Western Conference are emerging as potential fits for Mitch Marner.Though no official suitors have been named, teams like the Los Angeles Kings, Vegas Golden Knights, and Seattle Kraken have cap space and a desire to bolster their top-six forward groups.Early offseason chatter linked Marner to the Boston Bruins and Florida Panthers, but remaining in the Atlantic Division now appears unlikely. Facing the Maple Leafs multiple times each season while still in the Eastern spotlight runs counter to Marner’s apparent desire to fade from that narrative.Read more: Trade news: Blackhawks send Victor Söderström to Bruins for Ryan Mast and a draft pick According to teammate insight and league reports, this is about more than hockey.

The Pittsburgh Penguins have made a seismic decision about one of their biggest stars. Evgeni Malkin, the face of the franchise alongside Sidney Crosby and Kris Letang, appears to be nearing the end of his Penguins journey. Insider reports suggest that Malkin will not be offered a contract extension after the 2025–26 NHL season.This news breaks just a few years after the Penguins opted to retain their “Big 3” with multi-year deals. Malkin’s current four-year contract, signed in 2022, will expire at the end of next season. With no extension on the horizon, all signs point to a final curtain in Pittsburgh for the 37-year-old forward.The latest NHL trade rumor has fans and analysts buzzing. If Malkin chooses to continue his career after his contract ends, he will likely do so in a different jersey. According to trusted reports from team insiders, the Penguins do not plan to re-sign him, setting the stage for either a surprise trade or a free-agent departure.Though no trade has been confirmed, speculation continues to mount about whether the team could move Malkin before his contract ends, especially if the playoff picture remains out of reach.For many in Pittsburgh, the idea of Malkin, known fondly as “Geno,” leaving the franchise is hard to imagine. But with limited options left, retirement or relocation may soon become a reality.Evgeni Malkin’s legendary run with the Pittsburgh Penguins is undoubtedly winding down. The Russian center has played over 1,200 games for the team, collecting more than 1,300 points and becoming a central figure in three Stanley Cup wins.

Shubman Gill: A captain with a point to prove

A defining series for India’s next batting order





As India gear up for their five-Test tour of England beginning June 20 at Headingley, all eyes will be on the next generation of Indian batters. With stalwarts Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli no longer in the Test setup, the spotlight shifts to KL Rahul Yashasvi Jaiswal , and newly-appointed skipper Shubman Gill—each bearing different responsibilities and career arcs as they look to anchor India’s top order in alien conditions.At 33, KL Rahul is the most experienced batter in the squad. With 955 runs from 13 Tests against England, including three centuries, Rahul’s quality is undeniable—but so is his inconsistency.His 149 at The Oval in 2018 remains iconic, crafted when India were tottering at 121/5. Yet, in the same series, Rahul aggregated only 152 runs in his remaining nine innings. The pattern repeated in the 2021 tour, where his majestic 129 at Lord’s helped India to a famous win, only to be followed by single-digit scores thereafter.Rahul averages 34.11 in English conditions and has often struggled to convert promising starts. With the experience of over a decade behind him, this series could define whether Rahul finally sheds his tag of ""flashes of brilliance"" and matures into India’s dependable pillar in the middle order.In contrast stands 23-year-old Yashasvi Jaiswal, who has stormed into Test cricket with a blend of fearlessness and flair.He enters this tour as India’s highest scorer in the previous Border-Gavaskar Trophy and the team’s new senior opener.Jaiswal’s home Test average of 60.61 across 10 matches is stunning, but this tour will be his biggest challenge yet. His away average (44.18) is respectable, though the swinging Dukes ball, early movement, and long spells from England’s seamers will ask questions he’s never faced before.With no Virat or Rohit to turn to for guidance, Jaiswal must lead India’s charge from the top with composure and intent. His hunger and recent form make him a key player to watch.Shubman Gill takes on the toughest job in cricket which is leading India in a Test series in England, while still evolving as a player himself. His overall Test average at home is an impressive 42.03, but it drops significantly overseas (29.50), and his record in England is particularly underwhelming: just 88 runs in three matches at an average of 14.66.Now, with captaincy adding weight to his already high expectations, the question isn’t just about runs, it’s about temperament. Gill will be judged not only on how he bats but how he leads a team missing its most iconic modern-day batters. Former teammate Cheteshwar Pujara has expressed faith in Gill’s ability to rise to the occasion. For now, belief will have to carry him until the runs come.Quiz: Who's that IPL player? India’s tour of England in 2025 will be the first full Test series without either Kohli or Rohit since 2011. The burden of scoring and leadership is now shared between a veteran seeking consistency (Rahul), a young gun on the rise (Jaiswal), and a captain still forging his identity (Gill).Their performances may well shape not only the outcome of this series, but also set the tone for India's fortunes in the ongoing World Test Championship cycle.","Kl rahul, yashasvi jaiswal and shubman gill will lead india in the five-test series against england.

Dell Curry and Stephen





Fans of Stephen Curry have spent countless sleepless nights over the topic of his retirement. While he hasn't announced his retirement yet, it’s evident that he is contemplating his post-NBA career options. He is still under contract with the Golden State Warriors through the 2026-27 season and may even think about extending it.However, Stephen’s father, Dell Curry, recently addressed the topic of his retirement. In a conversation with DJ Siddiqi, Dell talked about his own experience of nearing retirement and suggested that for Stephen, the decision will likely come down to whether he still has the motivation to keep pace with the demanding preparation that is crucial for the NBA.“I think it’ll come down to—not necessarily his skill, or what he can do in a game in the season,” Curry said. “I think it’s a matter of, can he go through the rigours of preparing himself to play in an NBA season? I know when I retired, that was a big factor.""""I just didn’t feel like I had the energy, the effort to work and train throughout the summer. So I wouldn’t short myself, my teammates or the fans and give my all during that season.I think that’s what it’ll come down to.”But Dell also confirmed that he doesn’t see a retirement announcement coming from Stephen anytime soon. “He still loves the game,” Curry said. “He’s a competitive guy. He wants to win another title, so we’re not even close to that window yet. But when the time comes, I think he’ll make the right decision.”","Stephen curry hasn't announced his retirement yet.

A nickname born out of early dominance on the ice

Acceptance of a name that would define a legacy

Panthers Win Game 5 to Take 3-2 Lead in Stanley Cup Final | NHL on TNT





Wayne Gretzky is a name synonymous with greatness in the NHL , but the origin of his famous nickname, ""The Great One,"" has a surprising twist. During a recent segment on NHL on TNT’s Face Off, Gretzky shared that his father, Walter Gretzky, was not a fan of the moniker when it first appeared during his youth hockey days.Long before Wayne Gretzky shattered NHL records, he was just a ten-year-old prodigy from Brantford, Ontario, netting an unbelievable 400 goals in a single season. A reporter from the London Free Press came to profile the young phenom. At the conclusion of the article, the journalist proposed a fitting nickname: “The Great One,” drawing inspiration from legends like “Mr. Hockey” and “The Golden Jet.”“They said, ‘We should just call him The Great One,’” Gretzky recalled. “Well, my dad tried to kill that right away — it just kept coming back.”Walter Gretzky believed such a title placed unnecessary pressure on his young son. He didn’t want Wayne to bear the weight of premature hype. But despite his father's objections, the nickname gained traction and became permanently linked to the budding superstar.Over time, the family had no choice but to embrace the label. “Finally, I just was like, ‘Well, we’re going to have to live with it,’” Gretzky admitted.And live with it he did. By the time he retired in 1999, Gretzky had not only fulfilled but exceeded the expectations that came with such a grand title. With 894 goals, 2,857 career points, and 61 NHL records, “The Great One” wasn’t just a nickname—it became his rightful legacy.Switching gears to current NHL action, Gretzky also shared his thoughts on the Edmonton Oilers' Game 5 loss to the Florida Panthers. “Right from the get-go, Florida played a really smart, intelligent road game,” he said, noting that Edmonton looked “cautious” and “on their heels” early on.Also Read: No longer Canadian: Wayne Gretzky’s Canadian identity questioned after Donald Trump friendship sparks controversy From a childhood nickname to a storied NHL career, Gretzky’s story remains one of humility, brilliance, and enduring greatness.","Wayne gretzky's iconic nickname, ""the great one,"" originated from a profile of his youth hockey dominance.

Shohei Ohtani returns to the mound after a long layoff

BREAKING: Shohei Ohtani to Make Dodgers Pitching Debut Monday vs. Padres! Details Revealed!

Dodgers banking on Shohei Ohtani’s two-way magic





At last, the big night has arrived. Shohei Ohtani's pitching debut in a Los Angeles Dodgers uniform, and the energy to be this evening is palpable in the clubhouse. Dodgers ace Clayton Kershaw summed it up perfectly in a chat with Los Angeles Times reporter Dylan Hernández: “I think we all are (hyped for Ohtani’s debut). I think as fans of the game and just seeing him day in and day out get ready to pitch and do both, it’s going to be really fun, whether it’s one inning or whatever it is.”Shohei Ohtani has been just a hitter since he had elbow surgery last year, but it is anticipated that Ohtani will pitch a short outing, perhaps only an inning, against the San Diego Padres, his first time on a mound since June 6, 2022, when he was still batting and pitching at the same time. This will be Ohtani's first pitching game in almost 22 months.Shohei Ohtani last pitched in a Major League game in August 2023 while with the Los Angeles Angels. He has since fought through injury and recovery, fighting months of rehab and bullpens to regain strength. He cleared a major hurdle just this past week, when he threw 44 pitches in a simulated game.Especially now with the Dodgers' organization in the midst of an unprecedented injury crisis (14 pitchers on the injured list, including top-of-the-rotation starters Blake Snell and Tyler Glasnow), Ohtani's return would be providing more than just hope.It might only be one inning tonight, but this is as much a boost for the team as it is symbolic and strategic.Manager Dave Roberts explained that in the current situation, where the rotation is thin on the roster, Ohtani’s pitching is essentially ‘additive.’ It was, of course, in the middle of another stellar offensive season for Ohtani, which has continued unperturbed. He leads the National League in home runs (25), OPS (1.035), and slugging at the moment. His bat remains in midseason form.Also Read: Shohei Ohtani to make long-awaited Dodgers pitching debut against Padres on Monday The Dodgers gain a level of roster flexibility that few teams could achieve, considering that Ohtani would likely suit as a designated hitter and pitcher in the same game.

As England gears up for their upcoming five-match Test series against India starting June 20, Joe Root stands on the verge of multiple milestones. The English batting star, currently with 13,006 runs in 153 Tests, is pursuing Sachin Tendulkar's all-time record of 15,921 runs, though realistically, Australia great Ricky Ponting's 13,378 is the achievable target. Root will also have the opportunity to surpass Rahul Dravid 's highest batting average in India-England matches.Root's current Test statistics showcase his excellence with an average of 50.80, including 36 centuries and 65 fifties, with a highest score of 262. He ranks as England's highest run-scorer and stands fifth overall in Test cricket.A modest series score of 373 runs would elevate Root past Ricky Ponting's tally of 13,378 runs, making him the second-highest run-getter in Test cricket history. Root's record against India is particularly impressive, accumulating 2,846 runs in 30 Tests at an average of 58.08, with 10 centuries and 11 fifties. His highest score against India stands at 218.In home conditions facing India, Root's performance becomes even more remarkable. He averages 74.95, scoring 1,574 runs in 15 Tests and 25 innings, with seven centuries and five fifties, including an unbeaten 180.Among players with at least 1,500 runs in India-England matches, Root holds the second-highest average of 58.55, trailing only Dravid's 60.93.A few centuries in the upcoming series could push Root past this benchmark.Root's recent form in the World Test Championship (WTC) has been exceptional. He scored 1,968 runs in 22 Tests during the previous cycle, maintaining an average of 54.66 with seven centuries and seven fifties.The English batsman is also approaching another milestone in the WTC, potentially becoming the first player to reach 6,000 runs. He currently leads the charts with 5,543 runs in 64 matches, averaging 51.80 with 18 centuries and 21 fifties in 117 innings.The Test series will commence on June 20 at Leeds, where Root will have the opportunity to pursue these significant achievements.","England face india in a five-match test series starting june 20.

NEW DELHI: His Bradmanesque run in domestic cricket in recent years has coincided with the most challenging phase of his career, but Karun Nair identifies “the end of 2022” as the darkest period he’s endured, calling it “quite a dark place. ” The 33-year-old’s return to the Indian Test team after eight years stands as a powerful testament to his resilience and determination.“In terms of incidents, I would say, it was quite a dark place at the end of 2022. Very emotional phase for me. I think the toughest time for me. Even tougher than 2018, or whatever, whenever that was,” Nair said during a conversation with R Ashwin on the latter’s YouTube channel.Nair, India’s only triple-centurion in Test cricket besides Virender Sehwag , is now on the verge of a remarkable comeback.On Friday, there's a strong chance he will be part of India’s playing XI for the first Test against England at Headingley, Leeds.Though he’s emerged stronger, Nair says he never wants to revisit that painful period when he struggled to understand why he was dropped from the Indian team shortly after scoring a historic triple century against England in 2016.“No. I don’t want to be where I was a couple of years ago, quite honestly.”He added, “I think at the moment, at least I am very grateful. Like you said, I have gotten past that complaining stage. Very grateful to be in the situation that I am and I just treat every day as something that's given to me, and I am living my life and doing what I love.“I am very grateful to everyone that has been part of my journey in the last 2-3 years at least. I have understood to value things. I have understood to value each moment and just treat every single day as a new day.”Nair admitted he was perplexed by the lack of communication when he was dropped from the Indian team.“Honestly, I couldn’t understand what was happening. Because after the 300 in Chennai, after the Australia series, I think the next series was in Sri Lanka in 2017.“I wasn’t part of that squad either. And from then on, I couldn’t understand what was happening. Then I had to go back in domestic cricket.”Looking back, Nair believes a strong performance against Australia could have secured his place in the side.“I had no clue what was happening. All I knew was my name wasn’t there. I couldn’t understand how it wasn’t there.“But if I look back and think that there is one side of me saying that ‘yes, I didn’t get too many opportunities’. But the other way I would also think is the four innings that I played against Australia, and I got a couple of starts.“If I had just converted those starts into bigger scores, maybe I wouldn’t be in this position or had to have gone through that.”Asked about his mindset during that difficult phase, Nair recalled: “Just figuring out how I should go about things and what I should be doing.“Obviously, I was a lot younger at that time and couldn’t probably control what was running in my head like I am able to do today. So, basically, just a confused mind and was trying so hard to get back that I think I just kept getting worse.“But I had a great season that year in domestic cricket and I was able to come back like I said in the 2018 season. And then again, went back there. Didn’t have too many opportunities.”While out of the Indian side, Nair said the support he received from his state team, Karnataka, was invaluable.“I think there has always been a great bond between the players in Karnataka. Because we all played together from a very young age. And all of us made the grade at the same time, if I can say that.“So, there was always support. There was never anyone, you know, lacking that support. They have always said good things. They always knew the player that I was. So, I always had the trust from the players in the Karnataka team at least.“So, to go back there, it again felt like a family. And obviously, it didn’t have a great season. But that happens to anyone, I would think. And yeah, it’s just everyone felt or everyone supported me.“Like I said, it’s like a family. And everyone was caring. And they never put any undue pressure on me in terms of, ‘oh, I wasn’t scoring’ or no one really came up to me,” Nair said.","Karun nair says he was in a 'dark place' when he was dropped from the indian team.

In a decision that’s sparking conversation across the sports world, Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce has reportedly delayed his return to team training following his attendance at a wedding celebration with global pop icon Taylor Swift . Instead of heading straight back to Kansas City, Kelce remained in Florida, choosing to extend his time with Swift after the couple’s recent public appearance at the high-profile event.While the NFL offseason workouts are voluntary, Travis Kelce’s absence didn’t go unnoticed.

Every public appearance, comment, and decision feeds into a narrative that fans devour. Their relationship has fueled massive headlines, from luxury date nights to joint vacations, and now, Kelce’s extended break post-wedding. This latest episode adds to the speculation: how much will their bond influence Kelce’s football future?What does it mean to be a professional athlete today?

Joe Burrow, one of the most popular and talented players in the league, has finally opened up about Trey Hendrickson’s situation with the Cincinnati Bengals. While Joe Burrow is known for always supporting his teammates, it seems like his take on Trey Hendrickson’s situation with the Cincinnati Bengals has raised some eyebrows among fans.Recently, Joe Burrow was spotted at the Cincinnati Bengals’ first day of minicamp but Trey Hendrickson remained missing from it.After the minicamp, Joe Burrow was asked about Trey Hendrickson’s situation and the star player said, ""Last year we had two (distractions) This year we have one.
