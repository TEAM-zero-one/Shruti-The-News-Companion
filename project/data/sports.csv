NEW DELHI: Chief election commissioner Gyanesh Kumar on Saturday exhorted the young electors to not only vote without fail, but to also lead the fight against misinformation, disinformation, and false narratives.""For this, it is essential that they remain fully informed about electoral processes and the various initiatives of the Election Commission, and actively disseminate accurate information among their friends, families, and communities,"" he underlined in a televised address on the eve of National Voters Day observed on Jan 25 every year. .Mentioning the initiatives by young voters to raise electoral awareness, be it in the Attappady tribal region of Palakkad, Kerala or in Banamalipur, Khurda, Odisha, Kumar announced that EC will be launching a dedicated, youth-centric programme this year to provide young citizens with a clear understanding of the electoral process and connect them directly with the Commission’s initiatives.Also describing pure electoral roll as a bedrock of democracy, Kumar underlined that the success of special intensive revision (SIR) process in Bihar was evident from the zero appeals filed against the final roll and the record-breaking 67% turnout recorded in the state assembly election held thereafter.""In its renewed and dynamic form, the commission has not only ensured the accuracy and integrity of electoral rolls and made the voting process more accessible to every elector, but also effectively addressed electoral challenges, thereby strengthening every stage of the electoral process to make it more robust, transparent, and trustworthy,"" he stated.Outlining the nearly 30 initiatives undertaken by the EC over the past year, the CEC said the prominent ones, apart from SIR, include capacity building of election officials through intensive training of 5,000 booth level officers (BLOs) and BLO supervisors at the India International Institute of Democracy and Election Management (IIIDEM), New Delhi; and the launch of the ECINet App that brings over 40 different EC apps on a single digital platform. Also on the list were voter-facilitation measures like introduction of mobile deposit facilities at polling stations and capping the number of electors per polling station at 1,200.Highlighting the growing presence of EC on the world electoral map, Kumar said India’s strong and transparent electoral system has drawn global attention. ""The entrustment of the chairship of International IDEA to India is a matter of immense pride for us all,"" he said while drawing attention to the India International Conference on Democracy and Election Management (IICDEM) successfully held here from Jan 21 to 23, with the participation of representatives of election management bodies (EMBs) and ambassadors from over 70 countries.","Chief election commissioner gyanesh kumar on saturday exhorted the young electors to not only vote without fail, but to also lead the fight against misinformation, disinformation, and false narratives.

Shivam Dube press conference: On Ishan and Surya’s knock & his role with the ball

After a difficult year with the bat in T20 Internationals and the added responsibility of captaincy weighing heavily during that phase, Suryakumar Yadav opened up on how patience, time in the middle and stepping away from social media helped him find his groove again.Suryakumar managed just 218 runs in 21 T20Is across 2025, raising concerns as India prepared to defend their T20 World Cup title next month. Those doubts, however, have eased during the ongoing series against New Zealand. He began with a measured 32 off 22 balls in the opening game before switching gears with a blistering 82 off 37 deliveries in the second.“There’s a coach sitting at home as well, to whom I am married. She keeps telling me, ‘I think you should take some time (in the middle)’,” Suryakumar said while speaking to Ishan Kishan in a BCCI video. He added that his wife’s close understanding helped him recalibrate his approach. “She reads my mind. I decided to take some time… and I have got a better feeling.”He admitted that net sessions alone were not enough. “I was anyway telling everyone that I was batting well. I was trying in the nets. But no matter how much you do in the nets, until you score runs in the match, you don't get confidence,” he said.A break away from the game and social media also played a key role. “I got a good break of 2–3 weeks. I went home and cut off all social media… I practiced well in the last three weeks and I came in with a good (mental) space,” he explained.Kishan chipped in, saying, “… and it’s very important to stay happy,” a thought Suryakumar fully agreed with. “Cricket is a fantastic leveller… it is very important to have humility,” he said.Suryakumar also joked about breaking the narrative that India only wins when Abhishek Sharma scores big. “… we also had to end this conversation in front of the world,” he said. “If Ishan gets runs, we can win the match too… It's a team game.”Praising Kishan’s explosive 76 off 32 balls, which included the fastest T20I fifty by an Indian against New Zealand, Suryakumar said, “I have never seen anyone bat like this in my life in T20 cricket.” Kishan responded by saying confidence was the key. “I was seeing the ball really well… even on a good ball, I felt like I would either hit it or take a single,” he said.","Suryakumar managed just 218 runs in 21 t20is across 2025, raising concerns as india prepared to defend their t20 world cup title next month.

Chiefs face a long offseason as Mahomes' family embraces time together



Kansas City Chiefs fans are still processing an unexpected end to the 2025 season. Instead of playoff football, the biggest Chiefs story this week came from Instagram. Brittany Mahomes shared snapshots of a very different kind of Saturday night. She and Patrick Mahomes took their three children, Sterling, Bronze, and Golden Raye, to ""Disney On Ice"" in a moment that mixed family joy with life after football.This wasn’t about touchdowns or injuries. It was about real life. And after the Chiefs’ season ended in mid-December, fans needed that.The Chiefs’ 2025 season came to an abrupt stop on December 14, 2025. In a game against the Los Angeles Chargers, Patrick Mahomes suffered a serious knee injury. He tore both the ACL and LCL in his left knee. The injury required surgery the very next day, on December 15. Since then, Patrick has been in rehab, aiming for a return by Week 1 of the 2026 NFL season.That injury meant Kansas City missed the playoffs entirely. This is the earliest offseason the franchise has seen since 2014, before Patrick became the full-time starter in 2018. Fans who had grown used to deep playoff runs were left with a long winter waiting for football again.Enter ""Disney On Ice"". Brittany shared clips from the show on Instagram Stories. Characters like Mickey Mouse, Minnie, and Donald Duck skated around, interacting with the crowd. The Mahomes kids were fully into the performance, eyes glued to the ice. Brittany even did an outfit check, showing she kept it casual in a black Adidas zip-up jacket, white wide-leg pants, and white sneakers.Brittany summed up their night simply. On Instagram, she wrote it was the “best time today.” That caption came with several pictures of the family together in the stands. It was a clear reminder of what matters off the field.Patrick has also shared updates on his recovery. On December 16, 2025, he posted a photo of himself on the field in his Chiefs jersey with a clock emoji. Brittany responded in the comments with four red hearts. Then on January 1, she posted a picture of him on crutches at their home celebration, writing “Happy New Year” with a sparkle emoji.Patrick Mahomes is now set to enter his ninth NFL season. Drafted in 2017 as the 10th overall pick, he sat behind Alex Smith his rookie year and became the starter in 2018. Since then, he has led Kansas City to six straight AFC Championship games and three Super Bowl titles in 2019, 2023, and 2024. For now, the field is quiet. But life goes on, and the Mahomes family showed how they’re making the most of it.","Patrick mahomes and brittany mahomes took their three children to ""disney on ice"" the chiefs' 2025 season came to an abrupt stop on december 14, 2025.

Cleveland Cavaliers vs Orlando Magic Key Matchups (January 24, 2026)

Thevisit theon January 24, 2026, at the Kia Center in a matchup that matters for Eastern Conference standings. Cleveland comes in at 26-20, while Orlando is 23-20, with both teams trying to stay in the playoff mix.Injuries are shaping this game on both sides. Rotations are thinner than usual, and several key players are unavailable. That puts more pressure on the starters and shifts the focus toward interior scoring, rebounding, and half-court execution.Cleveland is on the second night of a back-to-back and will be without several perimeter players. Darius Garland is out with a right great toe strain. Sam Merrill is sidelined with a right hand sprain. Max Strus continues to recover from left foot surgery (Jones fracture). Chris Livingston and Luke Travers are unavailable due to G-League two-way assignments.Orlando could get Jalen Suggs back, with his status listed as probable after missing three weeks with a right knee MCL contusion. Franz Wagner remains out with left ankle soreness. Colin Castleton is unavailable on a G-League assignment. With these absences, both teams are expected to lean heavily on their frontcourt players.Both teams are likely to play through the paint more than usual given the depleted backcourts.Cleveland leads the all-time regular-season series 67-62 across 129 games, though Orlando has traditionally performed well at home against them. This season, the Cavaliers hold a 2-1 edge, outscoring the Magic by an average margin of 10 points per game. Cleveland has averaged 120.0 points in those matchups, while Orlando has scored 110.0. Rebounding has been a key factor so far. The teams will meet again on January 26, March 11, and March 24.Cleveland holds a slight edge on offense, while Orlando has been more consistent defensively, even with recent lineup changes.Donovan Mitchell remains the engine of Cleveland’s offense, averaging a career-high 28.9 points per game and posting a strong on-court net rating. His matchup with Jalen Suggs, if Suggs plays, will be central, especially given Suggs’ impact on defense.In the frontcourt, Evan Mobley and Jarrett Allen carry much of Cleveland’s interior workload, while Paolo Banchero and Wendell Carter Jr. anchor Orlando’s attack. Orlando averages 54.0 points in the paint per game, which could test Cleveland’s interior defense. Mobley is coming off a strong performance with 29 points and 13 rebounds.Orlando has played well at home, while Cleveland enters on a two-game win streak. With both teams short-handed, this game is likely to come down to execution, rebounding, and who controls the paint late.","The cleveland cavaliers host the orlando magic on january 24, 2026.

What really happened in Minneapolis that led NBA to postpone Warriors vs Timberwolves game?

Warriors-Timberwolves game rescheduled after sudden postponement

The Golden State Warriors were set to compete with the Minnesota Timberwolves on Saturday, 24 January 2026. However, an unforeseen circumstance has led to the postponement of the game. The league's big decision regarding this was confirmed by ESPN’s Shams Charania earlier on Saturday. The Warriors, including players like Jonathan Kuminga and Stephen Curry, had been preparing for tonight’s game until the news flashed open all over the internet.But the real question that lingers upon everyone’s mind is, will this incident hamper the alignment of other matches? All thanks to Charania for immediately setting the rescheduled dates to avoid clashes between matches. Here is why Saturday’s game between the Warriors and the Timberwolves had to be postponed.The Warriors vs. Timberwolves game was postponed on Saturday due to a fatal shooting that took place earlier in the area. The shooting involved a citizen who was trying to have a confrontation with a federal agent. According to ESPN's Shams Charania, this marked the third similar incident involving a federal agent in Minnesota, the second being last week.According to CBS News, the incident occurred roughly at 9:00 am locally, and the victim was a 37-year-old man who was believed to be a resident of that area. As per the statement released by the Department of Homeland Security, the man approached the agents with a 9mm handgun, shortly after which they openly fired at him.On Saturday, ESPN’s Shams Charania announced that the league had postponed Saturday’s clash between the Golden State Warriors and the Minnesota Timberwolves, which was to be scheduled at 5:30 pm ET. “The Timberwolves-Warriors game in Minneapolis has been postponed by the NBA, sources tell ESPN, in wake of a man shot and killed Saturday in a confrontation with federal agents in the city”, Charania commented on X. “It's the second shooting there in a week, third this month, involving a federal officer”.The game has been postponed to tomorrow, at 5:30 pm ET. “Timberwolves-Warriors has been rescheduled to Sunday at 5:30 pm ET in Minneapolis -- turning this into a back-to-back Sunday and Monday between the two teams”, Shams Charania further posted a tweet on X.","Golden state warriors vs minnesota timberwolves game postponed due to fatal shooting.

Cody Glass shines as New Jersey Devils narrowly defeat Vancouver Canucks despite last-minute pressure

Vancouver Canucks vs. New Jersey Devils - Game Highlights

The New Jersey Devils stretched their winning sequence away from home as they carved a narrow 5-4 victory over the Vancouver Canucks in a very entertaining match. Cody Glass gave a good show as he picked up not only a hat trick but also an assist.This was the New Jersey Devil’s fifth victory in their last six games and capped a strong start to a four-team road swing, which is 3-0 so far. New Jersey allowed momentum to slip away on many occasions throughout this contest, yet they appeared to answer all the right questions with balanced scoring and workhorse goaltender Jacob Markstrom.The New Jersey Devils struck early and often, and from a pace standpoint, they established a plan with a quick-opening first period that had Vancouver on its heels from the outset. Rookie forward Lenni Hameenaho scored his first NHL goal just over a minute into the contest by beating his man back to a loose rebound in front and depositing it home. The early goal was a sign of things to come in a pace and forecheck-based contest.The Devils extended the lead to 2-0 with a power-play one-timer past traffic by Nico Hischier early in the second period; Glass also scored for the first time with his power-play goal to make the game 3-0 for New Jersey.Vancouver battled on with desperation to inch closer to closing the deficit with goals by Linus Karlsson and Teddy Blueger in response to New Jersey.The Devils' power play proved to be an important factor as Connor Brown scored to extend the two-goal margin again in the late minutes of the second period. The Devils completed the 2-for-2 performance on the power play, while Vancouver continues to have issues on the penalty kill, and they have been seen over their last few games played away from home as well. The third period saw Vancouver press their case hard, but Glass scored a decisive goal halfway through this period. What’s noteworthy here is that this partial breakaway came as a result of Glass slipping past Vancouver’s defenders. This goal has also been notable, as it has halted Vancouver’s cause, and with this goal, Glass has scored five points in his last two games.The loss for the Vancouver team showed the struggles facing them as they continue to desperately look for their victory. As far as the New Jersey team is concerned, the win speaks to their momentum as well as the depth and closing strength the team displays on the road.",Cody glass scores hat trick as new jersey devils defeat vancouver canucks 5-4.

Paddy Pimblett backs himself with big support and big belief



Paddy Pimblett is treating UFC 324 as one of the biggest nights of his MMA career. The popular lightweight star has gone all out to make the moment special. Pimblett revealed that he spent around $150,000 to bring his family and close friends to Las Vegas. He wanted his people to be there in person when he steps into the Octagon at the T-Mobile Arena.The Liverpool native will headline UFC 324 against Justin Gaethje with the interim lightweight title on the line. The stakes could not be higher. A victory would put Pimblett on the brink of superstardom and possibly set up a future fight against undisputed champion Ilia Topuria. With history, pride, and gold at stake, Pimblett is fully locked in.Paddy Pimblett recently spoke during the weigh-in show for the first-ever Paramount+ UFC event. When asked if he had spent over $100,000 on tickets, he made it clear the figure was much higher. He explained that the total cost was closer to $140,000 or $150,000. He also mentioned that many fans from Liverpool had bought tickets on their own, meaning the crowd would still be full of familiar voices supporting him.The 31-year-old knows what is on the line. A win at UFC 324 would make him only the fourth fighter from the United Kingdom to win a UFC title.He would join Michael Bisping, Leon Edwards, and Tom Aspinall. That achievement alone would place him among British MMA royalty. Betting odds also favor Pimblett, with bookmakers listing him as the favorite while Gaethje enters as the underdog.Pimblett has also shared his game plan for defeating Gaethje. Speaking with the TNT Sports team, including Michael Bisping, he said his goal is to control the distance early. He plans to stay at range and wait for Gaethje to turn aggressive. At that point, Pimblett believes he can either land a clean shot for a knockout or take advantage of a scramble to secure a takedown and finish the fight on the ground. He confidently added that once he is on top of Gaethje, the fight would not last long.UFC 324 also features major bouts across the card. Sean O’Malley faces Song Yadong, while heavyweights Derrick Lewis and Waldo Cortes Acosta meet in a powerful clash. Still, all eyes remain on Pimblett as he chases gold in front of a crowd filled with his own people.",Paddy pimblett is treating ufc 324 as one of the biggest nights of his mma career.

Tristan Stubbs was full of jokes on the eve of the fourth SA20 final against Pretoria Capitals. That is not just the fourth final of South Africa's T20 competition, but also for the Sunrisers Eastern Cape (SEC). No team has had a more jaw-droppingly good record in franchise cricket than the SEC. They've now been to all four finals and won the silverware twice.With Capitals skipper Keshav Maharaj joining him for media duties, Stubbs joked he would reveal their strategy only after the final at Newlands. He also elicited a chuckle upon revealing he had far too many requests for tickets. (Alas, Newlands is sold out for the SA20 final!)The 25-year-old was casual and calm even as his team took the longer route to their 'usual' place in the SA20 calendar. Having finished top of the league table, they lost to the Capitals in the first qualifier. During the second chance, they romped past Paarl Royals at the Wanderers.A few hours later, they were in the Western Cape, back in their usual territory -- preparing for the final, the skipper posing next to the trophy and taking questions at a swanky five-star hotel.And the skipper here, Tristan Stubbs, has plenty to prove going into the final. As the only new leader in the SA20 Season 4, Stubbs had giant Aiden Markram-shaped shoes to fill. So far, he's learnt the pressures of the job as things go along but hasn't shied away from seeking help from seniors like Quinton de Kock when stumped.“The most challenging has been some days you feel like you know exactly what needs to be done and then other days I'm like I have no clue what to do,” Stubbs said.“But I've had good senior players. We've pretty much bounced everything off each other, but it's just when some days you're so decisive and you know what you want to do and other days you get a gut feeling and some days it doesn't rock up,"" continued Stubbs who has contributed 129 runs from 11 matches this season at an average of 43 and produced a best score of an unbeaten 47.Therein lies the problem with most cricketers who take on captaincy duties - their free-flowing cricket goes for a toss. Having come into South Africa's T20 World Cup squad as an injury replacement for Donovan Ferreira, the pressure is on Stubbs to find form.Having been acquired by the SEC in 2022 for R9.2 million, Stubbs has been part of the franchise since the very beginning. He, alongside Marco Jansen and Jordan Hermann, have been to all finals now. Except the 2023/24 season, where Stubbs scored 301 runs at an average of 60.20 and strike rate of 168.15, the Knysna-born batter has not fulfilled his promise. Not yet at least.Stubbs, who is scoring at a disappointing strike rate of 119.44, is a shadow of the player who reached the highs of 378 runs in 14 innings in IPL 2024. The fall also cost him his place in the Proteas setup, which he regained only due to injuries.""He's got the experience and we do know that he's got the power game and the touch game and the complete package when he's firing,"" South Africa coach Shukri Conrad had said this week of Stubbs.“I think it's up to us to be able to unlock all of that again. And it might just be one little switch somewhere.""Both Stubbs and SEC would be hopeful that the switch gets flicked on Sunday evening -- when it all matters.When the SEC and Capitals met in the first qualifier, played at Kingsmead, the Sunrisers looked to be ahead at one point before Capitals got the job done with ease. That broke the SEC's three-match winning run over the Capitals, which stretched back to the previous season.Is revenge on his, and the team's, mind going into the final? Stubbs smiled slightly before saying, ""No no! There's no revenge! We start nought-for-nought, We'll plan like we do for most games,"" he explained.“The important thing I guess is not getting too far ahead of yourselves. I think that's the key in a final.“You don't look too far ahead. You play the current or in the moment. You never really try and put your foot off the pedal. If you've got a team on top, you try and, as best as you can, keep the pressure on as much as possible,” stated Stubbs.In their second SA20 final appearance, Pretoria Capitals chase their maiden success. In the 2023 season, Capitals had finished runners-up at the Wanderers. In the two seasons that followed, they didn't even qualify for the playoffs. A much-changed squad later, with Keshav Maharaj at the helm, and a legendary combination of Sourav Ganguly and Shaun Pollock running the show from the sidelines, they'd be keen on turning the tide this time.Speaking ahead of the final, Ganguly revealed he had met Dewald Brevis and Maharaj when the South African team were in India. He continued to stay in constant touch with the unit, as much as a month before start in late December.“It’s been good in the last 40 days. So, it’s been a good relationship. It’s not about the coach, it’s about the players. I’ve always tried to help these young boys, but it’s their intensity and their want to become better that is the reason that we’ve played so well,” he said during the JioStar Press Room.The likes of Brevis, Bryce Parsons and Sherfane Rutherford have benefitted from Ganguly and Pollock's presence in the dugout.""Ganguly is very excited. It's his first assignment as coach. He has been a captain who has won on many big occasions for India. Having someone of his stature in our dressing room has brought that sense of calm to the changing room. He is very positive, he is very accessible because he wants the best out of his players. He gives everyone the same equal love that everyone deserves,"" said Maharaj, who is Capitals' highest wicket-taker this season.""It's not easy carrying drinks and doing all the other stuff. But he has made it very clear that all members of the squad have a hand in getting the team up as a unit. Fingers crossed we can go all the way, and hopefully it unlocks a lot of opportunities for him.""","Sunrisers eastern cape will take on pretoria capitals in the sa20 final. The sec have now been to all four finals and won the silverware twice. The skipper here, tristan stubbs, has plenty to prove going into the final. Pretoria capitals face south africa in the sa20 final at kingsmead.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127448925,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-158946,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
NFL penalizes 49ers Dee Winters and Deommodore Lenoir for missed infractions in Seahawks playoff win,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-penalizes-49ers-dee-winters-and-deommodore-lenoir-for-missed-infractions-in-seahawks-playoff-win/articleshow/127446365.cms,"NFL penalizes 49ers Dee Winters and Deommodore Lenoir for missed infractions in Seahawks playoff win

NFL hands down fines Dee Winters and Deommodore Lenoir after Seahawks rout

The NFL dropped the hammer on the San Francisco 49ers after their messy divisional-round loss to the Seattle Seahawks. Adding fuel to the fire, the NFL fined LB Dee Winters and CB Deommodore Lenoir for separate on-field violations during the blowout defeat. The announcement capped a brutal weekend for San Francisco, turning a forgettable playoff exit into a costly lesson on discipline and how fast mistakes ruin January football.The punishment stems from a game the 49ers would erase if they could. Seattle dominated from the opening kickoff, cruising to a 41–6 win that exposed San Francisco on both sides of the ball. According to Newsweek, the NFL released its weekly fines report on Jan. 24, confirming that Winters and Lenoir were each penalized for plays in the third quarter.Winters was fined $5,907 for a hip-drop tackle at the 4:01 mark. The league has made that technique a point of emphasize, viewing it as a safety risk that can trap ball carriers' legs under a defender's weight. Lenoir's punishment was far steeper. He was docked $20,944 for the use of a helmet after head-butting Seahawks wide receiver Jaxson Smith-Njigba at the 10:05 mark of the same quarter.Per the NFL norms, a hip-drop tackle is when a player ""grabs the runner with one or both hands or wraps the runner with both arms"" and then ""unweights himself by swivelling and dropping his hips and/or lower body, landing on and/or trapping the runner's leg(s) at or below the knee.""After the game, Deommoddore Lenoir said, ""To have those guys, [it would have been] a totally different game. But I mean we can't make no excuses. We had enough guys in here to get the job done.""Those brief descriptions carried real financial weight. For Winters, the fine came despite a productive outing. He led the team with nine tackles, added three tackles for loss, recorded a QB hit, and allowed 26 yards on three receptions in coverage. Lenoir, meanwhile, had a solid coverage day statistically, surrendering just one catch for four yards on two targets, per Pro Football Focus.Still, numbers couldn't mask the larger story. The 49ers had only 236 total yards and 3 turnovers. Brock Purdy threw for 140 yards with an interception. Christian McCaffrey was bottled up all night. In that matter, the fines symbolized a loss of control as much as individual errors.For the 49ers, the NFL decision closed the book on a season-ending collapse. The fines won't change the results, but they underline how slim the margin is in the playoffs, and how fast frustration can turn expensive when discipline slips.","Nfl penalizes 49ers dee winters and deommodore lenoir for missed infractions in seahawks playoff win.

He's so passionate about it. His legacy will definitely stay and live with many different younger generations that look up to him.""He's a great champion on and off the court,"" added the 38-year-old.Wawrinka made his debut at Melbourne Park in 2006 and won the major in 2014.He also won the French Open a year later and the US Open in 2016 at a time when Djokovic, Roger Federer, and Rafael Nadal were dominating men's tennis.""I think it's been a great farewell Australian Open for him with the crowd support and everything that has happened on the court,"" said Djokovic.""When he's gone, tennis is going to lose a great player and a great person.""","Novak djokovic hails stan wawrinka as a ""great champion"" who inspired him.

Player 58 Jack McKenna’s smart move in Beast Games Season 2 cubes challenge has fans divided,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/us-streamers/player-58-jack-mckennas-smart-move-in-beast-games-season-2-cubes-challenge-has-fans-divided/articleshow/127435186.cms,"Image Via Instagram

Jack McKenna proves he’s the smart player in Beast Games Season 2 cubes challenge





Player 58, named Jack McKenna, gained acclaim from Beast Games viewers during its second season after displaying an intelligent and strategic maneuver during the cube challenge round. During the cube competition, teams consisting of three players had to stay inside a giant cube until one of the players chose to self-eliminate from the competition. As a member of the smart team, consisting of players Sue, Tyler, and himself, Player 58 decided to manipulate the cards to ensure that the next card pulled from the cube was the lowest card for Sue, securing passage to the next round for both him and Tyler while evoking some controversy among gamers questioning if such an act was unfair.The show, which streamed on Prime Video, focused on aspects of strategic gameplay, luck, and psychology that Beast Games is known for, especially in cube challenge tests, in which participants could opt-in for a method of determining who would eliminate themselves. Jack's strategic gameplay, planning, and execution of his second deck of cubes demonstrated his reputation as an intelligent player of this game. Even Sue, a former Survivor contestant, admitted she had hoped to go far in the game, which made Jack’s tactic even more impressive and sparked online debates about strategy, trust, and its impact on future rounds.Jack McKenna later explained to MrBeast how he prepared for the challenge. He said he prearranged the cards to know where the highest ones were and used this knowledge to his advantage. Although Sue tried to shuffle the deck, Jack had a backup deck ready, showing foresight and planning. The moment illustrated not only his clever thinking but also his understanding of human behavior and teamwork. Tyler admitted he didn’t know about the second deck, proving how much Jack’s strategy influenced the outcome.While the fans on Reddit and Instagram were split between views on the decision made by Jack, some believed that the action might convey a disadvantage if he were to participate in further rounds due to the need to have trust in the game. However, there were others who felt that he demonstrated intelligence because the rules stated that the teams were given the chance to choose the way they were going to self-eliminate.Jack, a Christian Brothers Academy graduate from Albany, and a current junior majoring in electrical and computer engineering from Purdue University, has already shown that he has what it takes to blend brains with brio under challenging circumstances. Be sure to check back with Beast Games Season 2 later to see whether Jack’s clever approach will get him to the finale or whether lapse of trust will get him expelled from the race.","Player 58, named jack mckenna, gained acclaim from beast games viewers during its second season after displaying an intelligent and strategic maneuver during the cube challenge round.

Mario Kart World update brings new Knockout Tours races for Nintendo Switch 2 players: What is it and how it works,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/technology/gaming/mario-kart-world-update-brings-new-knockout-tours-races-for-nintendo-switch-2-players-what-is-it-and-how-it-works/articleshow/127159791.cms,"Mario Kart World's new Knockout Tours on Nintendo Switch 2: What is it and how it works





Nintendo has released a free update for Mario Kart World on the Nintendo Switch 2, adding a team racing feature to Knockout Tour mode for both local wireless and online play. The most recent version, 1.5.0, significantly expands the game's multiplayer options by enabling players to race as a team in Knockout Tour. Bug fixes and general enhancements are also included in the update. According to Nintendo's official support page, the update also contains Polish language support and several game-wide issue fixes.Knockout Tour is a racing mode where 24 drivers race through multiple courses around the world without stopping. There are five checkpoints during the race, and drivers who are below a particular position at each checkpoint are eliminated. Until now, the Knockout Tour has only allowed individual players to race against each other. The new update changes this by allowing up to four teams to compete together.Players can join 2 friends on Nintendo Switch via local wireless or online play. The update lets players set up Knockout Tour races as two teams (12 vs. 12), three teams (8 vs. 8 vs. 8), or four teams (6 vs. 6 vs. 6 vs. 6). If there aren't enough players, computer-controlled drivers will fill the empty spots.Twenty-four drivers start the race, and the bottom four are eliminated at each checkpoint until only four remain. As players approach a checkpoint, they can see which drivers have cleared it in the top-right corner of the screen. Team colours show how each team is doing.After the Knockout Tour ends, the winning team is decided by the total points earned by all team members. Points are awarded based on each driver's overall finish.However, the points awarded in Knockout Tour team races are different from those in other modes. Top finishers earn many more points: 50 points for 1st place, 40 points for 2nd, 35 points for 3rd, and 30 points for 4th. Making it to the final four helps the team. Drivers who don't make it past the first checkpoint only get 1 point.If all four drivers from the same team pass through the final checkpoint, that team wins automatically. Working together as a team is essential for winning. GameChat can help players coordinate better when playing online from different locations.If a player gets eliminated, they can still watch the race until the end. They can switch the camera to follow the driver they want to support and choose from a list of comments to share with other spectators.To add friends, players can select their user icon (My Page) on the system's HOME Menu, then select Add Friend. From there, they can send and accept friend requests in a few ways by following the instructions.For Mario Kart World, every system needs the game to play, but players can bring a friend online if they both play on the same system. Some other games support GameShare, which lets friends play together even when only one person has the game.In addition to the new Knockout Tour team races, the update also addresses several technical issues in the game. The update fixes a problem where the game would sometimes end if a player chose Kamek on Choco Mountain. It also resolves an issue where the displayed rating would sometimes be incorrect when joining ""Everyone"" in ""Online Play"" while in a room. Moreover, several other issues have been fixed to improve the overall gameplay experience.","Knockout tour is a racing mode where 24 drivers race through multiple courses.

How Bhut met his hero

NEW DELHI: “Pressure daalte raho, chhodna mat, dominate karte raho”: Ravindra Jadeja kept reminding left-arm spinner Parth Bhut from the moment Shubman Gill walked out to bat during Punjab’s Ranji Trophy clash against Saurashtra.Punjab had no answers to Saurashtra’s spin attack and suffered a 194-run defeat inside two days on Friday. Set a stiff target of 320 on a testing surface, the visitors folded for 125 in their second innings. Gill, Punjab’s biggest hope of steering a fightback, managed just 14 off 32 balls before being dismissed. His struggles mirrored the first innings, where he was sent back for a two-ball duck.In both innings, Gill was trapped leg-before by Bhut, who finished with a 10-wicket match haul. After returning figures of 5 for 33 in the first innings, the left-armer delivered an even more incisive spell the next day, picking up 5 for 8 from 10 overs.The spinner from Junagadh credited Jadeja’s constant guidance for his success against Gill and his Player of the Match performance.Bhut, who took up cricket idolising Jadeja, is now living a dream — sharing the field with his hero and soaking in the nuances of the game while learning the finer points of becoming a complete all-rounder.“Jaddu bhai is a legend of the game. He has played a lot of cricket and always shares his experience. Ahead of the Punjab match, he addressed us in the dressing room and said we had to dominate and play attacking cricket. ‘Attack karna hai’ — that’s all he said. When Shubman, who has also played a lot of cricket, came in to bat, Jaddu bhai told me to attack him and be aggressive, and that’s what worked for me. He always discusses match situations and guides us on how to keep a batter under pressure and how to get him out. During practice too, he tells me what kind of balls I can bowl on such wickets, what fields can be set and how to plan dismissals. Putting Gill under pressure worked for us,” an elated Bhut told TimesofIndia.com in an exclusive interview.“More than the Player of the Match award, I am really happy that I could contribute to the team’s win and that we managed to beat a strong side like Punjab within two days. This victory will help us in the later stages of the tournament,” the spinner said.“When Saurashtra became champions for the first time in 2019–20, I broke into the Ranji Trophy side,” said Bhut, who has featured in 22 first-class matches and bagged 76 wickets while scoring 571 runs.The 27-year-old spinner hails from Junagadh and, as a child, would travel to Jamnagar whenever Ravindra Jadeja played or trained there, just to watch the India all-rounder in action.After being aware that a young boy regularly turned up to watch him, Jadeja decided to interact with the aspiring cricketer.“One fine day, I managed to speak to him. When he got to know that I also played junior cricket, I got the chance to bowl at the senior team — that’s how it all began. He always says, ‘Keep working hard. There is no substitute for hard work. Keep working hard and it will pay off one day.’ That’s the approach he has towards cricket. Even at this age, he works extremely hard in the nets. Youngsters get tired, but he doesn’t,” Bhut said.“He is my idol. He is my hero. I took up cricket because of him. I couldn’t have asked for more than sharing the field with a legend like him,” he concluded.","Parth bhut was named the player of the match in punjab's ranji trophy clash against saurashtra. The left-armer took 10 wickets in the match, including 5 for 8 from 10 overs. He credits ravindra jadeja for his success against shubman gill. The 27-year-old took up cricket idolising jadeja as a child.","https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-127445807,width-1280,height-720,imgsize-56304,resizemode-6,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-600/photo.jpg"
