Why Indira didn’t let Rajiv attend two proposed meetings with Bhindranwale,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/why-indira-didnt-let-rajiv-attend-two-proposed-meetings-with-bhindranwale/articleshow/124278925.cms,"Indira Gandhi

NEW DELHI: The year 1984 is a defining moment in Sikh history but could events have taken a different course? A new book suggests there were windows of opportunity to control militant preacher Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale, but these were squandered because “politics and politicians came in the way of conflict resolution”.In the months leading up to Operation Blue Star , then PM Indira Gandhi wanted her son Rajiv to secretly meet and negotiate with Bhindranwale. Two meetings were even set up by then Congress MP Amarinder Singh between 1982-84 but they never materialised because Indira was worried that her son’s life might be in danger.The last-minute cancellation of the meetings infuriated Bhindranwale, who later moved into the Golden Temple in Amritsar, setting the stage for Operation Blue Star, Gandhi’s assassination and the 1984 riots, making the year among the bloodiest in India’s political history.“I set up the meeting twice. The first time [in 1982], I picked up Rajiv and we drove to the Safdarjung airport where a special aircraft was to fly us to the Ambala Air Force station, where Bhindranwale was already waiting for us. We were recalled before we could reach the airstrip. I had to make up a story and told Bhindranwale that we couldn’t make it because the plane had developed a technical snag,” Singh says in an interview to journalist Harinder Baweja in her book ‘They Will Shoot You, Madam: My Life Through Conflict’.The book says, “Within a fortnight, Amarinder picked up Rajiv Gandhi again. They were to, once again, go to the Ambala Air Force station where Bhindranwale had already reached. This time, Amarinder was sure they would make it for the meeting. They were airborne, and on their way, but the pilot got a radio message asking him to return.”According to Singh, the second meeting was aborted because Gandhi had been told by then Punjab CM Darbara Singh that there were plans to ambush Rajiv. He claims Rajiv shared this with him. The book says, “Amarinder also suspects that Darbara Singh, who had favoured Bhindranwale’s arrest, wanted to get back to his bête noire, Zail Singh and that he was the one who told Mrs Gandhi to not let her son walk into the trap.”Another lost opportunity was in 1981. Bhindranwale was arrested for the murder of Punjab Kesari editor Lala Jagat Narain, but released within weeks after home minister Zail Singh told Parliament there was no evidence against him. “Once free, Bhindranwale went to Delhi to celebrate. He was accompanied by close to a hundred supporters who openly brandished their weapons.Home Minister Zail Singh made no attempt to rearrest him; nor did Prime Minister Indira Gandhi,” writes Baweja. “The seniormost politicians of the country catapulted Bhindranwale into a hero. The genie was now out of the bottle.”","A new book suggests there were windows of opportunity to control militant preacher jarnail singh bhindranwale.

Who is Kathy Leutner and what does she do for a living?

A relationship rooted in privacy and shared passions

Sidney Crosby may be one of the NHL’s most celebrated players, but when it comes to his personal life, the Pittsburgh Penguins captain has always preferred to keep things private. For more than 15 years, Crosby has shared his life with Kathy Leutner, a model who has built her own impressive career away from the rink. Their relationship, while mostly out of the public eye, has captured the curiosity of fans who rarely get a glimpse into Crosby’s off-ice world.Kathy Leutner began her modeling career in 2005, but it was her 2011 appearance in Sports Illustrated that gave her the major breakthrough. Since then, she has worked with several fashion and lifestyle brands, including Abercrombie & Fitch, Hollister, Faviana, and Famous. Originally from Chantilly, Virginia, Leutner now resides in Halifax, Nova Scotia, alongside Sidney Crosby.What makes her stand out is her decision to live away from the spotlight. Unlike many partners of professional athletes, Leutner avoids social media, which has only added to the intrigue around their relationship.Still, she is often spotted supporting Crosby at games, a consistent presence throughout his career..The couple first met in 2008 through a mutual friend, when Sidney Crosby was just 21 years old and quickly rising as one of hockey’s brightest stars. Leutner, who was also an athlete in high school, shared Crosby’s passion for sports—something that likely strengthened their connection from the beginning.Over the years, Crosby has hoisted the Stanley Cup three times and added multiple individual honors, including three Ted Lindsay Awards and two Hart Trophies. Meanwhile, Leutner has carved out her own path in fashion, proving her staying power in a competitive industry.Also Read: “He is eligible”: Golden Knights spark outrage as they close in on controversial Carter Hart signing Despite their successes, both Crosby and Leutner have chosen to prioritize privacy, letting their accomplishments speak louder than headlines.

Frank Seravalli weighs in on Connor McDavid’s future after Kirill Kaprizov’s $136M deal

Connor McDavid’s goal: The best team around him with a genuine chance to win

Level of concern with McDavid potentially leaving?

Connor McDavid’s dilemma is to win now or cap later

Connor McDavid’s future with the Edmonton Oilers has once again taken center stage in NHL contract discussions. After Minnesota Wild forward Kirill Kaprizov secured an eight-year, $136 million extension this week, the attention immediately shifted to what Edmonton’s superstar captain might demand when his next deal comes up. The Oilers are already weighed down by big-money contracts that could limit how far they can go for McDavid.While McDavid is expected to set the market whenever he signs, Edmonton’s financial structure complicates the picture. The Oilers are currently locked into expensive long-term commitments. Leon Draisaitl’s $14 million salary, Evan Bouchard’s double-digit deal, and Darnell Nurse’s $9.25 million contract already consume a large portion of the cap. On top of that, goaltender Stuart Skinner is due for a significant raise in the near future.NHL insider Frank Seravalli highlighted this challenge, stating, ""They can't, I don't think the Edmonton Oilers can afford to go more. In fact, I don't think on their cap that they can really even afford to go 17 million, um, because of all the other deals that they've got."" That kind of financial squeeze makes it difficult for the Oilers to entertain numbers north of $17 million annually — a figure that insiders believe McDavid could command.Even with the NHL’s salary cap set to climb in the coming seasons, Edmonton’s roster construction leaves little margin to maneuver.Oilers GM Stan Bowman addressed Connor McDavid’s contract situation on Wednesday, admitting there is still no clarity on whether the superstar captain will have a new deal before the regular season begins. Bowman revealed via TSN that ongoing talks with McDavid’s agent Judd Moldaver remain frequent but offered no firm timeline, stressing, “I don’t like to make predictions, we’ll see where it goes.”Beyond the financial puzzle, McDavid’s decision may come down to competitiveness. The Oilers have enjoyed success over the past two years, but McDavid understands that aging players, a thin prospect pipeline, and limited draft picks can quickly derail momentum.For McDavid, the question is not simply “how much” but “how far can this team go?” He has made it clear throughout his career that chasing a Stanley Cup defines his priorities. That means Edmonton must strike a balance — paying its franchise player while still building the depth required to compete against the league’s best.Kaprizov’s blockbuster contract raised expectations league-wide, but McDavid’s case is different. He may ultimately accept less than his maximum value if it ensures the Oilers remain contenders. At the same time, Edmonton must find creative ways to manage the salary cap or risk losing the most dominant player in the game.McDavid’s decision will shape not just the Oilers’ future, but also the landscape of the NHL. His contract situation is now one of the defining storylines of the league.Also Read: Leon Draisaitl’s wife Celeste Desjardins just can’t stop reliving her dream wedding; Labels it “Happiest day of our lives”","Connor mcdavid's contract future with the edmonton oilers is under intense scrutiny following kirill kaprizov's massive deal.

Who is Meg Moroney, Nick Bosa’s rumored girlfriend?



Nick Bosa’s absence looms large for 49ers



The San Francisco 49ers are facing a tough road ahead after Nick Bosa tore his ACL against the Arizona Cardinals on September 21. Losing the star pass rusher is a massive blow for the team, but off the field, speculation about his rumored relationship with rising country music star Meg Moroney has fans talking almost as much as his injury. 'Moroney, also 27, grew up in Douglasville, Georgia, before studying at the University of Georgia. Initially on track for a career in accounting, she shifted her focus to marketing and music business, setting the stage for her rise in the industry. She first gained attention after performing “Strawberry Wine” at a campus event, and her career took off after moving to Tennessee in 2020.She skyrocketed to fame when her single Tennessee Orange went viral in 2022, telling the story of a Georgia girl wearing her rival’s colors for love. The hit was followed by her debut album Lucky in 2023 and Am I Okay? in 2024, which debuted inside the Billboard 200’s Top 10.Adding to her profile, Moroney has previously been linked to fellow country star Morgan Wallen, though she clarified they were never officially a couple. Today, it’s her rumored connection with Bosa that has everyone’s attention. If true, she could soon join a 49ers WAG circle that already includes Olivia Culpo, who is married to Christian McCaffrey.For now, Bosa’s absence on the field is what weighs most heavily on San Francisco. But off the field, his rumored romance with Moroney adds a touch of intrigue to an otherwise difficult season.Bosa, 27, was off to a strong start this season with two sacks already under his belt. His absence will be felt immediately, especially with the 49ers heading into a Thursday Night Football clash with the Los Angeles Rams. The timing of his injury coincided with Moroney’s appearance at Levi’s Stadium, where she was spotted in a suite wearing a custom 49ers jersey and hat, fueling rumors of a budding romance.The defensive lineman is no stranger to the spotlight beyond football. Over the summer, he was seen enjoying a Grateful Dead concert with teammate George Kittle in Las Vegas, hinting at his love for music. That makes his rumored connection with Moroney, who has quickly become one of country music’s brightest young stars, even more intriguing.Also Read: Who is Jake Tonges?

Napheesa Collier blasts WNBA leadership as Cathy Engelbert fires back in heated accountability clash

WNBA pro Caitlin Clark stated on Thursday that WNBA Commissioner Cathy Engelbert has not contacted her. The remark came after Napheesa Collier's revelation of a reported private conversation in which the league's leader made remarks against Clark. This occurred on Tuesday where the Minnesota Lynx player verbally attacked the WNBA commissioner. Additionally, Collier also said that the Commissioner of the WNBA reportedly told her that Caitlin Clark ""should be grateful to the WNBA because the league is behind sponsorship deals.""The Commissioner of the WNBA, Cathy Engelbert, is currently under fire. The Minnesota Lynx star Napheesa Collier called her ""negligent."" She also revealed a private conversation with Engelbert regarding Caitlin Clark, in which she reportedly stated that Clark should be ""appreciative"" of the platform the WBA offers her.In her long speech, Minnesota Lynx star Collier blasted league officials, especially Engelbert, for what Collier described as a lack of responsibility and concern for WNBA players. The guard for the Indiana Fever then made his first public remarks since the league's All-Star Game in July. Clark thought Collier had good points.During her exit interview for the Fever, Clark said:“We need great leadership at this time across all levels… this is the most important time in this league’s history… Phee said it all.” Clark further said that Collier ""made a lot of very valid points"" and emphasized the significance of having ""great leadership in this time across all levels."" She continued:“This is straight up the most important moment in this league’s history, where this league’s been around for 25-plus years, and this is a moment we have to capitalize on... So, that’s honestly what I would say. Phee said it all, what she said and the points she made.”In a private conversation, Engelbert told Collier that Clark and other players ""should be on their knees"" in appreciation for the platform the NBA has provided them. Collier claimed that Clark's endorsement arrangements were reportedly singled out by the commissioner, who claimed that if it weren't for the WNBA , she wouldn't have them.The vice president of the Women's National Basketball Player's Association, Collier, delivered a prepared speech that was direct and honest. She made several statements against the WNBA's executives, particularly against Engelbert. Collier asserted that the league's survival was seriously threatened by the ineptitude at the top. She said:""The real threat to our league isn't money. It isn't ratings or missed calls or even physical play. It's a lack of accountability from the league office. Since I've been in the league, you've heard the constant concerns about officiating, and it has now reached levels of inconsistency that plague our sport and undermine the integrity in which it operates...""Engelbert responded to the accusations recently, saying that she was ""disheartened"" by the way Collier described their conversations and league leadership. She wrote:“I have the utmost respect for Napheesa Collier and for all the players in the WNBA.. Together we have all worked tirelessly to transform this league. My focus remains on ensuring a bright future for the players and the WNBA, including collaborating on how we continue to elevate the game..”The statement continued:“I am disheartened by how Napheesa characterized our conversations and league leadership, but even when our perspectives differ, my commitment to the players and to this work will not waver.”Meanwhile, apart from Clark, A'ja Wilson also backed up Napheesa and her comments.Also read: What did Cathy Engelbert say?

Tom Brady’s NFL broadcasting role under fire



Can Brady turn it around at Fox Sports?



Seven-time Super Bowl champion Tom Brady has built a career defined by precision and dominance on the field. Now in the Fox Sports booth alongside Kevin Burkhardt, Brady is facing a challenge of a different kind: winning over viewers. Despite his 10-year, $375 million deal, his transition from quarterback to broadcaster hasn’t been smooth.While Brady remains a part of the Las Vegas Raiders’ ownership group, his role at Fox Sports has stirred controversy. Legendary broadcaster Dan Le Batard recently voiced strong criticism, saying Brady’s presence is actually hurting the viewing experience.“Tom Brady is distracting me during games because he’s still bad at this,” Le Batard said during The Dan Le Batard Show with Stugotz. He added that Brady isn’t even blending in as an average analyst but instead stands out for the wrong reasons.“Like it’s not even that he’s neutral or mediocre or milquetoast or just there, and I don’t notice it. I’m noticing, and he’s distracting me with it not being good.""Le Batard compared Brady’s lack of memorable commentary to Tony Romo’s early days with CBS, where Romo impressed audiences by predicting plays with accuracy.“Is there anything memorable that Tom Brady is giving the Fox broadcast for that $375 million guaranteed dollars… that would indicate he has improved at this to you?” Le Batard asked his co-hosts.His critique struck a nerve with fans who expected Brady’s legendary football IQ to elevate Fox’s No. 1 NFL broadcast team. Instead, viewers have noticed his inexperience. Even Greg Olsen, who was bumped to the network’s No. 2 analyst role to make way for Brady, has been praised for steadier, more insightful coverage.Despite criticism, Fox Sports seems unlikely to move away from Brady. The network invested heavily in his star power, banking on his name to attract viewers and advertisers. One fellow announcer suggested that sponsorship potential is the real reason Brady was given the top spot. Yet, as Le Batard bluntly put it, “I’m noticing when he’s doing things incorrectly. I’m not noticing when he’s doing them correctly.”For now, Brady has time to refine his broadcasting voice. With patience, guidance from peers like Olsen, and lessons from polished analysts such as Romo, he could still grow into the role. But until then, Fox faces a tough reality: its biggest investment is still trying to find his rhythm off the field.Also Read: Tyreek Hill sends emotional hospital plea to brands days after devastating season-ending injury","Tom brady’s fox sports struggles spark harsh criticism from dan le batard.

How Sergio Conceicao Might Transform Al Ittihad: 5 Key Changes,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/saudi-football/news/how-sergio-conceicao-might-transform-al-ittihad-5-key-changes/articleshow/124278197.cms,"Sergio Conceicao (Image Source: Getty)

A shift to compact 4-4-2 with coordinated pressing

Faster vertical transitions and wide overloads

Stronger defensive structure with tighter spacing

Merit-based selection and role clarity

Targeted recruitment aligned to the playing system

Al Ittihad are once more facing a choice. Following the separation from Laurent Blanc, the Jeddah giants are reportedly on the verge of appointing Sérgio Conceição, the passionate Portuguese coach who has built his career at Al Ittihad. Not only due to his energetic and strict attitude on the sidelines, but also his general no-nonsense handling of the squad, Conceição may well bring a completely new flavour to the Saudi Pro League. Below are five main changes that could outline his period if he were to take the helm.Porto's squad under Conceição was a thoroughly trained 4-4-2 system with a narrow tactical approach. Those were not simply about the shape of the players on the pitch but also about their reaction to the pressure and their discipline.For Al Ittihad, it would signify going beyond defensive passive blocks and implementing a system where two attackers direct the pressing, driving opponents to the flanks and removing access to the middle of the pitch. Such closeness would facilitate the defenders in fending off the attacks, while, at the same time, it would require every outfield player to have a high level of stamina.Conceição likes his teams to go forward with quick and targeted moves after they regain possession.So Al Ittihad’s wide players and full-backs should be able to link up at great speeds along the sides of the pitch, thus generating overloads to stretch the opposition’s defensive line.Conversely, the team would focus more on direct vertical play, early crosses, and quick attacking transitions instead of the usual patient buildup. In the Saudi Pro League, where matches are often decided in transition phases, Al Ittihad could gain a crucial advantage over its rivals.Also Read: Sergio Conceicao Set to Take Charge as Al Ittihad’s New Manager A defence-first approach has always been a significant part of Conceição's coaching style. While at Porto, his teams were consistently among the best clubs in Europe, allowing very few goals. If he implemented the same tactics at Al Ittihad, it would result in defenders and midfielders being positioned closer together, more cover for the defence, and higher vigilance against rest-defence to avoid quick counterattacks.One of the major changes in the culture that Conceição might cause is the ruthless method of selection. He is said to choose players solely on their current form, hard work, and tactical discipline without considering their reputation. Even star players will have to acclimate to his requirements or face the possibility of sitting out. This could lead to a tighter rivalry among the team members and even help them know their characters well. This type of behavior most times leads to better team spirit and higher collective standards.Although Al Ittihad already boasts several big-name players, Conceição will likely seek new signings that better fit his style. So the team may include speedsters that are good at defense, athletic full-backs that can go up the field endlessly, and midfielders that not only press hard but also pass forward quickly. Rather than a complete overhaul, player acquisition with his mentorship might be more precise, allowing the club to seamlessly function in the system by tapping into its areas of strength.",Sergio conceição is on the verge of becoming al ittihad's new manager. The portuguese has been in charge of porto since 2006. He is known for his no-nonsense style of play and ruthless selection. His tactics could include a shift to a 4-4-2 with coordinated pressing.,"https://static.toiimg.com/thumb/msid-124278168,width-1070,height-580,imgsize-787434,resizemode-75,overlay-toi_sw,pt-32,y_pad-40/photo.jpg"

Jorge Jesus focuses on structure, balance and squad continuity

Sérgio Conceição emphasizes intensity, pressing and risk-taking

Saudi football has gone through a managerial renaissance. Two of Portugal's most famous coaches, Jorge Jesus and Sérgio Conceição, are not only the present but also the future of Saudi football. Jesus is on his way back to Saudi Arabia to be the head coach at Al-Nassr. Meanwhile, Conceição has been appointed at Al-Ittihad. Both are seasoned professionals who have made their names in Europe, and Saudi clubs regard them as icons of ambition. However, their football tactics differ significantly. To understand each coach's preferences, let's compare their training methods.Jorge Jesus always has a tendency to structure and provide a tactical unity that is usually materialized by patience in possession and the appearance of decisive moments. Throughout his career in Portugal, Brazil, and Saudi Arabia, he has always been drawn to the idea of teams that are balanced and can turn the tide of the game by their tactical adaptability.One of his first decisions at Al-Nassr explains this style well, as he chose to reduce Cristiano Ronaldo’s participation to 75 percent of matches. This shows his sense of managing top players who need rest, and at the same time, providing a high level of performance throughout the season.He went on to say that he left Ronaldo out of an AFC Champions League match because he was confident enough in the team and tactically balanced.Jesus designs his squads to be not only defensively solid but also well-drilled in transitional play. His approach aims to blend the brilliance of superstars like Ronaldo and João Félix with the stability of an organized system. The competitive nature of football in Saudi Arabia suits his strategy, allowing Al-Nassr to maintain a strong identity, balance multiple competitions, and reduce the burden on individual players.Also Read: Sergio Conceicao Set to Take Charge as Al Ittihad’s New Manager Sérgio Conceição, on the other hand, is typically described as someone with an outraged and reactive approach. At Porto and other European clubs, he used to play fast breaks, persistent pressing, and tactical changes that were made to break the opponent’s game.Conceição often set up his team with a 4-3-2-1 lineup and changed it to 4-4-2 at times to dominate midfield areas and get rapid attacking chances. His players had to work very hard during their time out of possession, hustle opponents in a brief time, and administer a strike when the ball was given to them. His daring personnel moves have earned him the reputation of being a man who puts tactics above the stats.Conceição might as well install an aggressive and risk-taking Alfa type that would challenge possession-oriented teams, place pressing traps, and seek to unsettle rivals with his pace and fury had he been hired by Al-Ittihad.","Saudi football has gone through a managerial renaissance.
