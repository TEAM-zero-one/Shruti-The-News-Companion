Klay Thompson left Warriors for Dallas but they traded everybody

Mavs hope to build around Cooper Flagg

When Klay Thompson signed with the Dallas Mavericks in the summer of 2024, the intention was simple: join Luka Dončić and Kyrie Irving to form the most lethal trio in the league. For a four-time NBA champion who was looking for a fresh start, it was a dream scenario.But fast forward to February 2026, and that dream hasn't just faded, it’s been completely broken. Due to Kyrie Irving’s ACL injury in early 2025 and a series of franchise-altering trades that sent Luka Doncic to the Lakers in 2025 and Anthony Davis to the Wizards in 2026, Thompson finds himself in an odd man out situation as the Mavs franchise is pivoting towards the rookie sensation Cooper Flagg.The foundation of Thompson's signing with Dallas crumbled within eight months of his arrival when the Mavs sent their offensive force, Luka Dončić, to the Lakers in a blockbuster trade for Anthony Davis in exchange.With a grand slam basketball title, Davis’ arrival at Dallas was highly anticipated, but his time with the Mavs didn’t pan out as everyone expected, as it was defined more by injury reports than the trophy room. In his two seasons as a Mav, he played in just 29 games and was sidelined either by a groin injury or a hand injury. For the 2025-26 season, Davis averaged 20.4 points, 11.1 rebounds, and 2.8 assists while shooting at an efficiency of 50.6% from the floor in 20 games.On February 4, 2026, the Mavericks officially pulled the plug on their experiment and sent Davis to Washington in exchange for a package of picks and role players. But this also left Thompson without the supposed central gravity on the hardwood.First, without Luka’s vision and playmaking on the court, and then without Davis’ 7 '5 "" wingspan in the paint, Thompson struggles to adjust to the continuous changes and is averaging a career-low of 11.6 points on just 38.9% shooting from the field.With the veteran core dismantled, the Mavericks put a lot of hope on their #1 overall pick from the 2025 NBA draft, Cooper Flagg. The arrival of this former Duke's phenomenon changed the offensive trajectory of the franchise. Despite the current 19-31 record, Flagg continues to show potential to make Dalla’s ultimate dual force. He is currently leading the team in total points (926), points per game (20.1), and steals (55) and steals per game (1.2).While Flagg’s development is a win for the front office, it leaves Thompson in professional confusion and uncertainty. According to The Athletic’s Christian Clark, “Thompson, brought in to complement Dončić and the injured Kyrie Irving, is a player the Mavericks will listen to offers about.”For Klay, the move to Dallas was supposed to be about adding a fifth ring, instead, it has become a masterclass in how quickly an NBA contendership can vanish.","Klay thompson signed with the dallas mavericks in the summer of 2024.

The record-setting low Super Bowl game

Over the years, NFL fans have seen thrilling comebacks, record-breaking performances and games packed with points. From shootouts that crossed the 70-point mark to last-minute touchdowns that decided champions, the NFL’s biggest stage rarely disappoints in terms of excitement.On the other hand, not every Super Bowl turns into an offensive show. Sometimes, the focus is on defensive systems and field position battles instead of quarterbacks and wide receivers. One championship game stands noteworthy in history because the score was very low. It is still the Super Bowl with the fewest points scored, and it shocked millions of people around the world.The lowest-scoring Super Bowl in NFL history was Super Bowl LIII, played on February 3rd 2019. In that game, the New England Patriots defeated the Los Angeles Rams by a score of 13-3. The two teams combined for just 16 total points, the fewest ever in a Super Bowl.The game was held at Mercedes-Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia. Expectations were high heading into the contest. The Rams had one of the league’s most explosive offenses that season, while the Patriots were led by veteran quarterback Tom Brady. Many fans expected a high-scoring battle.Instead, they witnessed a defensive showdown.Neither team scored a touchdown in the first three quarters. In fact, the score was just 3-3 late into the third quarter. It was the first Super Bowl in history where no touchdowns were scored through three quarters.Finally, in the fourth quarter, Patriots running back Sony Michel scored on a short touchdown run to give New England the lead. A later field goal extended the advantage to 13-3. The Rams struggled to move the ball consistently, and their offense was unable to respond.Wide receiver Julian Edelman was named Super Bowl MVP after recording 10 catches for 141 yards. Although there were no explosive scoring plays, his steady performance made the difference. Before Super Bowl LIII, the previous lowest total in a championship game was 21 points. The 16 point total in 2019 broke that record and set a new mark that still stands today.While some fans called it boring, others appreciated the tactical battle between two strong defenses. It proved that even on the biggest stage, defence can take center stage and decide the outcome.Super Bowl LIII may not be remembered for fireworks, but it will always be remembered for rewriting the record books in the most unexpected way.","The lowest-scoring super bowl in nfl history was super bowl liii, played on february 3rd 2019.

Miami Heat looking to acquire Giannis and Ja without losing its core

Giannis Antetokounmpo and Ja Morant’s impact on the hardwood

Since Giannis Antetokounmpo and Ja Morant’s names have hit the trade market, the league’s atmosphere changed. With teams gunning for the Greek Freak and Mr. 360 degree, salary caps have been continuously moved around to make space to afford these superstars.As reported, the Heat are exploring an option of a monumental double-swoop to acquire both Giannis Antetokounmpo and Ja Morant before the NBA trade hits its deadline on February 5 at 3:00 PM ET. But there’s a catch. According to Steve Popper of Newsday, Heat's President Pat Riley is looking for a scenario that could land both superstars while keeping All-Star center Bam Adebayo and veteran guard Norman Powell in Miami.Steve Popper via his X account tweeted, “With about 30 hours to go ahead of the deadline, of all the rumors one wild one a league source told me yesterday he's hearing: possibility of -- Miami pairing moves for Giannis and Ja Morant without giving up Bam or Powell.”Reflecting on the situation, Popper said, “My reaction was what most will be -- How could they pull that off? I was just told don't doubt Andy Elisberg and then Spoelstra ability to fill out the rotation.”An ideal scenario for every franchise to construct a trade for two maximum-salary players without including the team's most valuable asset, and that is what the Miami Heat is looking for. They want to acquire Bucks’ cornerstone Giannis Antetokounmpo, who’s currently earning $54.1 million, and Grizzlies star guard Morant, who carries a cap hit of $39.4 million, but without disrupting their core players, Bam Adebayo and Powell.With a potential $90+ million in salary cap space to get Ginnais and Ja, Miami would need to build a package with other younger players to be able to make their dream come true.Giannis Antetokounmpo is currently sidelined with a right calf strain suffered on January 23 against the Nuggets, and as per the protocol is not expected to return until late February. Before the injury, he was averaging 28 points, 10 rebounds, and was shooting 64.5% from the field.Ja Morant is also recovering from a left-elbow UCL sprain and will be out through February. He played only 10 games this season and averaged 19.5 points and 8.1 assists.While the Heat may be interested, the injuries of both Giannis and Ja add a layer of risk. Despite all the speculations, Antetokounmpo recently told The Athletic on Tuesday that he remains committed to winning in Milwaukee, and he emphasized that his primary goal is to be in a position to compete for another championship immediately. According to ESPN's Shams Charania, ""There are certainly questions about whether Milwaukee's serious and genuine about pulling a move of this magnitude for this franchise at the deadline.

Fred Warner explains why Raheem Morris fits the San Francisco 49ers defense

Fred Warner did not try to take credit for any front-office move. Instead, the San Francisco 49ers linebacker kept things simple and honest when talking about the team’s latest coaching decision. Speaking on The Pat McAfee Show on Wednesday, Warner shared his thoughts on the 49ers hiring Raheem Morris as their new defensive coordinator.The move came after the team decided to part ways with Robert Saleh. While Warner made it clear that players were not involved in the decision, he also made it clear that he fully supports it. After missing most of the 2025 season due to an ankle injury, Warner is focused on what comes next. From his point of view, Morris brings experience, trust, and a clear defensive mindset that fits what the 49ers have always believed in. Warner explained that he has only heard positive things about Morris from people across the league. That alone gives him confidence going into the 2026 season. With several key defenders expected back on the field, the timing feels right for a fresh voice leading the defense.Warner spoke openly about why he believes Morris is the right choice for the job.He praised Morris for being respected wherever he has worked and said he is excited to finally sit down and talk football with him.“I love the hire,” Warner said. “We’re not mad at all. We love the hire, man. All I hear is great things about Raheem. Wherever he’s been, it sounds like he’s been beloved everywhere he’s been. I’m interested to see being able to talk to him and see what his plan is for our defense.”Warner also touched on the identity of the 49ers defense. He explained that the team has long relied on a 4-3 system that lets the defensive line attack early while the secondary plays fast and reads the ball.“And we’ve always run a 4-3 defense of just telling the D-ends and the D-line to get off the rock and letting the backend just kind of play with vision and ball out, break, play fast, play violent. And I expect nothing less going forward,” Warner said.The linebacker missed all but six games last season after suffering an ankle injury against the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in October. During that time, he learned more about the team than he expected. In an interview with SB Nation writer Jeanna Kelly, Warner spoke about what standing on the sidelines taught him.“Honestly, you learn a lot when you’re behind the scenes and not watching from the sideline,” Warner said. “I think we have one of the best cultures and standards of any team in the entire NFL, and you really learn that when you go through hard times as we have.”He also praised head coach Kyle Shanahan, saying the team stayed competitive even when key players were injured.

Justin Herbert and Madison Beer just had their ‘eventful’ pre-Grammys rendezvous

Why Justin Herbert and Madison Beer are easy NFL Honors red carpet candidates tonight

Los Angeles Chargers quarterback Justin Herbert just took his relationship with Madison Beer fully public, and it took exactly one viral Instagram caption to send NFL fans into detective mode. After the pair stepped out together at a pre-Grammys event, the next logical question is simple: will they show up arm in arm at NFL Honors in San Francisco on Thursday night?Herbert is not a finalist for any of tonight’s major awards, but he is still one of the league’s most recognizable quarterbacks and is already busy stacking off-field wins. NFL Honors 2026 kicks off at 9 p.m. ET from the Palace of Fine Arts in San Francisco, with Jon Hamm hosting and NBC, NFL Network, and Peacock carrying the broadcast.Herbert and Beer attended a pre-Grammys event at the Beverly Hilton together. Cameras did not catch them posing on the red carpet, but they were seen inside the event as a couple.Beer then did the rest on Instagram. She posted photos in a strapless dress from the gala with a one-word caption, ""Eventful,"" and Herbert quietly slid into the comments with heart-eyed emojis. It told fans exactly where this relationship stands without a single formal statement.The singer is in the middle of her own run. She recently released her album Locket, which she has described as one of her most personal projects, even pulling ideas directly from fans for ad-libs and details. The timing meant the record was too late for this year’s Grammys window, so the pre-show circuit doubled as both promo and a first big step onto the carpet with Herbert.Herbert, meanwhile, is coming off a season that ended short of the Super Bowl but still kept him firmly in the national spotlight. Between Beer showing up in the stands and their first public event together, his off-field profile looks very different from even a year ago. For a league that loves marketable quarterbacks with crossover appeal, that matters when cameras start rolling on nights like NFL Honors.NFL Honors is built for this kind of moment. The 15th edition of the show will hand out MVP, Coach of the Year, Rookie of the Year, and more while also revealing the Pro Football Hall of Fame Class of 2026. Finalists include Trevor Lawrence and Christian McCaffrey for MVP, Liam Coen for Coach of the Year, and a long list of rising stars on both sides of the ball.The event will also spotlight the Walter Payton Man of the Year field and the new “Protector of the Year” award, all staged just days before Super Bowl LX kicks off at Levi’s Stadium. In other words, it is the one night on the calendar designed to pack as much NFL star power into one building as possible, on the football side and on the entertainment side.Herbert will not hear his name called as a finalist tonight, but that does not mean he will stay home. Quarterbacks of his profile often attend even without a nomination, especially when they are already in the middle of national campaigns. He just fronted a TCL television spot for Super Bowl season, telling fans, ""Nothing like gamedays with @tcl_usa. Want a chance to win a brand new QM8K TV from their Ultimate Series? Enter the sweepstakes linked in my bio,"" before walking through why the screen needs to feel like a live stadium.In the video, he adds, ""What’s up guys? I’m here at Best Buy today. Picking out a new TV for one of you. When you’re watching football, details matter. You want bright, clear and big enough to feel like you’re at the big game. This is my pick, the TCL QM8K, part of the Ultimate Series. It’s the ultimate choice. Delivers ultimate black levels, ultimate brightness for the ultimate game day experience."" It is polished, it is sponsor-friendly, and it fits exactly the kind of brand presence networks want on a live awards broadcast.Add Beer to that picture and the NFL gets what every awards show chases now: a crossover couple that can move both sports and pop culture timelines. There has been no confirmed report that Herbert or Beer will be on the NFL Honors red carpet, and the league has not teased them as attendees.","Herbert and beer attended a pre-grammys event at the beverly hilton together.

With only days left before the Big Game, there is no room for costly injuries. Being careful is key. Unfortunately, Seattle Seahawks safety Nick Emmanwori tweaked his ankle during Wednesday’s practice.According to NFL Insider Ian Rapoport, the rookie safety injured his ankle while defending a pass late in practice. Positive news? The 21-year-old standout walked off the gridiron on his own shortly before 4 PM.Several players and coaches went over to comfort him before he left. Rapoport said Emmanwori will have imaging of his ankle to make sure there is nothing major. “He had an ankle today,” Seahawks head coach Mike Macdonald said via a pool report. “We brought him in to look at it, and we’ll kind of go from here and figure out what are the next steps.”The rookie safety, selected 35th overall in the 2025 NFL Draft, played only four snaps in the regular season opener before suffering a high ankle sprain in his right ankle. He missed three games, then returned and stayed for the rest of the season.In his first NFL season, the nickelback recorded 81 tackles, nine tackles for loss, 2.5 sacks, four quarterback hits, and 11 passes defended in 14 games.At the NFL Honors, he was named a finalist for Defensive Rookie of the Year.The Seahawks have two more days to practice for the NFL finale: Thursday and Friday.

Even veteran players like linebacker DeMarcus Lawrence acknowledge that.“I believe we all found out early in training camp,” Lawrence told Owen Crisafulli of Heavy Sports. “He [Nick Emmanwori] was making so many plays out there. To see a rookie thrive early in training camp, when you first get the playbook, is special. We definitely knew it from Day 1.”Three players from South Carolina, including the rookie safety, are scheduled to play in the Super Bowl: New England Patriots cornerback Marcellas Dial Jr., drafted in 2024, and Ernest Jones IV, drafted in 2021 by the Los Angeles Rams.

How Raheem Sterling built his football fortune

Paige Milian and the couple’s growing property portfolio

Raheem Sterling, the explosive England international, and Paige Milian, an aspiring businesswoman and property investor, have blossomed into one of sport's richest couples. They have really built a great brand that combines football with smart business. The duo boasts a recently amassed joint fortune worth nearly 60 million USD, a figure fuelled largely by that of Sterling’s years at the head of the Premiership pack and Milian, an increasingly influential force in property and lifestyle fronts.The couple combines public acclaim with a financial order, which is what makes it stand out. Whereas Sterling made his money via a series of football contracts and endorsements, Milian is known for creating rather than spending money, with a focus on long-term viability, property, and investment. What has grown is a contemporary alliance of power that marries sporting success with entrepreneurial vision.The pair's wealth has mainly been built through Raheem Sterling's rise in the world of football. Since then, from his early years in the Premier League to becoming an England staple, Sterling has secured contracts that would make even the best clubs in Europe envious.The marquee moves and celebrity status that led him to become one of the highest-paid stars of his era also garner him weekly wages that reflect his stature worldwide.However, Sterling has enjoyed lucrative commercial endorsements and sponsorship agreements in addition to his club salaries. Brands around the world have been keen to feature his image alongside theirs, and his wealth has surged ever since. Over the course of his career, careful financial management and a steady stream of earnings have pushed his personal net worth toward the 45 to 50 million USD range. His success highlights how modern footballers can transform talent into lasting financial security.Although Sterling is well known for his successes on the field, Paige Milian has been building a career of her own. Milian is an astute investor best known for her business and real estate interests. The value added through property ownership and development has been a key factor in solidifying the couple's overall wealth.Milian developed her own presence, creating revenue streams through fashion, modeling, and social media to supplement Sterling's earnings on the field. The duo is thought to jointly own several properties and assets, thus comprising the base of the team fanning their empire.

From semi-retirement to the Olympics, Team USA curling skipper’s remarkable comeback at 54",https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/international-sports/who-is-rich-ruohonen-from-semi-retirement-to-the-olympics-team-usa-curling-skippers-remarkable-comeback-at-54/articleshow/127937033.cms,"Rich Ruohonen (via Getty Images)

Veteran curler Rich Ruohonen finds new purpose with Team USA



Eighteen months ago, Team USA curling skipper Danny Casper was fighting a serious autoimmune condition that left his future in the sport uncertain. On some days, even simple tasks were difficult. Sliding a 44-pound granite stone down the ice felt impossible. His team began searching for a backup who could step in when needed. They wanted experience, leadership, and tactical sharpness. What they did not expect was to find all of that in a 54-year-old lawyer from Minnesota.That call changed Rich Ruohonen’s life. He had quietly stepped away from elite curling after repeated Olympic Trials heartbreak. The plan was to slow down and focus on senior events. Instead, a temporary favor turned into an Olympic dream. Now, Ruohonen is headed to the 2026 Winter Games with Team Casper, defying age, expectations, and his own doubts.Rich Ruohonen joined the team as an emergency option while Danny Casper recovered from Guillain-Barré Syndrome. At first, the role was meant to be short-term. But Ruohonen thrived. He fit in quickly with teammates half his age and impressed them with his calm leadership.Even after Casper regained strength, the team asked Ruohonen to stay on as their fifth player.Earlier this winter, that decision paid off. Team Casper qualified for the 2026 Olympics by winning a tense U.S. Trials final and then dominating a last-chance qualification event weeks later. For Ruohonen, it ended more than 20 years of Olympic disappointment. Speaking to Yahoo Sports , he said reaching the Games after thinking his career was over felt unreal and deeply rewarding.If he plays in Cortina, Ruohonen could become the oldest American to compete at a Winter Olympics. He hopes to get at least a moment on the ice. He said his main wish is for the team to stay healthy and win, but admitted he would love to throw a rock or two.Ruohonen’s journey began decades earlier. He learned curling from his father as a child and became an elite junior by his teens. Even while building a legal career, he trained before sunrise and saved vacation time for tournaments. Success came later than most. He won U.S. titles but also suffered painful near misses, including heartbreak at the 2022 Olympic Trials.Those losses convinced him his Olympic hopes were finished. He believed no team would want a curler in his 50s. Fate proved him wrong. Casper later praised Ruohonen’s game-calling ability, experience, and intelligence, saying the team was excited to learn from him.Now, Ruohonen brings strategy, humor, and unity to the group. He jokes about being the team’s “old guy,” while teammates tease him about his age. He says the banter shows their bond. Whether or not he plays much, Ruohonen’s presence has already made this Olympic run unforgettable.","Rich ruohonen joined the team as an emergency option while danny casper recovered from guillain-barré syndrome.

Giannis Antetokounmpo responds to Milwaukee Bucks' trade rumors via Instagram story

Giannis Antetokounmpo Instagram story

Giannis Antetokounmpo has battled several injuries this season



When it comes to the Milwaukee Bucks, they will never take a chance to let go of their star player, that is, Giannis Antetokounmpo , and the feeling is quite mutual. As the NBA trade deadline saw players like Anthony Davis and James Harden being traded from their former teams, fans assumed the same would happen with Antetokounmpo as well. However, the Bucks star’s Instagram story had put a stop to all the ongoing online speculations.Giannis Antetokounmpo had earlier posted an Instagram story citing news about his future with the league and with the Milwaukee Bucks. The 2x NBA’s Most Valuable Player remained injured during most of the recent matchups; however, his scores remain intact. Let us see what the Bucks star said about his trade speculations on social media.Giannis Antetokounmpo is a star player of the Milwaukee Bucks, and there’s no way the franchise is letting him go due to some mere injuries. Whatever the reasons may be, he remains the talk of the league because of his tremendous scores. The Instagram story featured the Bucks star wearing his jersey, paired with a sign that said, “proceed with caution”, meaning that the Bucks are going to keep him throughout the deadline.Most importantly, Giannis Antetokounmpo has consistently emphasized that he wants to stay with the Milwaukee Bucks and has therefore pledged his loyalty to the team. He said, “There will never be a chance, and there will never be a moment that I will come out and say, ‘I want a trade.’”Appearing on ESPN’s “First Take”, NBA analyst Brian Wildhorst cited the possibility that the Bucks could shut Giannis Antetokounmpo down after the deadline to protect the draft positioning. Most importantly, the Bucks star has sustained many injuries this season. As of December 5, 2026, Antetokounmpo had been suffering from a right calf strain.However, his excellent scores compelled teams like the Golden State Warriors, New York Knicks, and the Miami Heat to acquire him. But, as of now, Antetokounmpo has set barriers and doesn’t wish to be parted from the Milwaukee Bucks for another year or two. He has also expressed how he wanted to compete while playing for his current team.","Giannis antetokounmpo had earlier posted an instagram story citing news about his future with the league and with the milwaukee bucks.

The NHL trade market experienced its biggest transformation yet when the New York Rangers sent Artemi Panarin to the Los Angeles Kings right before the Olympic trade freeze. The league now directs its attention to other players who can make an impact because Panarin has become unavailable through his signing with the Los Angeles Kings.Olympic roster freeze starts today and will end on February 21, after which no transactions involving players will be entertained until February 22. After the freeze ends, teams will begin to evaluate players such as Vincent Trocheck, Robert Thomas, Dougie Hamilton, Nazem Kadri, and Boone Jenner, who possess center depth and blue-line stability and playoff experience.Vincent Trocheck currently stands as the most desirable center that teams can sign. The 32-year-old player signed a contract that extends until 2028-29, while his team-friendly salary stands at $5.625 million during the current salary cap increase. The number of top-six centers available in the market will create an opportunity for him to generate substantial trade value.Robert Thomas exists as a distinct category that differentiates him from all other existing classifications. The Minnesota Wild has slightly hinted that they may consider trading for a center, looking at their assessment of current players.According to some reports, the Blues would only trade it for a high-priced deal that includes young elite players. His trade value certainly makes him a player to watch as the trade period approaches.The situation with Dougie Hamilton remains silently interesting to people who follow it. The Devils defenseman has been linked to trade rumors for several months, while reports from earlier times showed he might change his preferred list of teams to trade with. NHL playoff teams seek right-shot defensemen who can move the puck because these players help teams build their defense long-term through their contractual agreements.The ongoing trade rumors about Nazem Kadri continue because Calgary keeps changing its player roster. He has three years left on his contract, which pays him $7 million each year, and his playoff experience, combined with his physical playing style, makes him an attractive option for teams that need veteran players.The name of Boone Jenner continues to exist in current discussions. The Blue Jackets captain will become a UFA this summer, and Columbus will begin handling its assets when contract negotiations reach an impasse.The trade that sent Panarin to another team ended the most significant news story of the day, but the market still contains players who can make an impact. The playoff teams will start their recruiting efforts after the Olympic freeze ends. The upcoming weeks will bring multiple changes to championship teams before the final deadline arrives.",The nhl trade market experienced its biggest transformation yet when the new york rangers sent artemi panarin to the los angeles kings.

Travis Kelce drops first fun detail about Taylor Swift wedding reception and it involves a lot of beer,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/travis-kelce-drops-first-fun-detail-about-taylor-swift-wedding-reception-and-it-involves-a-lot-of-beer/articleshow/127953449.cms,"Image - New Heights Podcast

“I can’t even count that high”: that’s Travis Kelce’s response about Garage Beer at the reception

New Heights

“Man, I can’t even count that high.”

So what do we actually know about the Swift–Kelce wedding plans?

They’re engaged. Swift and Kelce announced their engagement in August 2025 with a joint Instagram post.







They’ve hinted at wanting a memorable but intimate celebration, possibly with close friends and family. Some reports suggest a smaller, more personal wedding rather than a huge celebrity spectacle.







Kelce’s beer quip is the first public comment about the reception vibe, not the wedding itself.







More concrete details are still unconfirmed and likely to stay private until the couple chooses to announce them.







If you thought the biggest scoop about Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce’s wedding would be a date or location, think again because we got better news instead. On Thursday, the Kansas City Chiefs star casually teased that his reception with Taylor Swift won’t be dry, literally, and fans are already imagining the party.At a Super Bowl week party for hispodcast, Travis Kelce gets asked how many kegs of Garage Beer, the brand he co-owns with his brother Jason, will be at his wedding reception with Taylor Swift. Kelce laughed, shrugged, and said:That’s essentially our only concrete detail right now, if this wedding happens, it’ll probably have a lot of beer flowing. Whether that means dozens of kegs or something even bigger is anyone’s guess, he didn’t elaborate.Let’s be clear: no official wedding date, venue, or guest list has been confirmed by the couple or their representatives. What Kelce did was a lighthearted, off-the-record comment, not a formal announcement.In fact, multiple sources now say that planning for the Swift–Kelce wedding isn’t even fully underway, with some reports calling it “on pause” as the couple focuses on careers and enjoying the engagement.So while the idea of a beer-fueled reception is catchy, we’re still a long way from the logistics most readers actually crave.Kelce isn’t just a football player who eats beers for breakfast, he’s a businessman who’s helped grow Garage Beer into a brand people talk about. Having that show up at a reception makes sense from a branding and personality perspective.And from a cultural angle, this kind of comment plays perfectly into the narrative of an NFL superstar who likes to have fun even amid massive life changes like a wedding.Here’s the reality based on verified info so far:","Travis kelce casually teased that his reception with taylor swift won’t be dry, literally, and fans are already imagining the party.

Key injury (Feb. 5)



Cam Thomas - OUT



Franz Wagner - OUT





Thevisit the Kia Center on Thursday to face thein an Eastern Conference matchup between teams in very different positions. Brooklyn sits at the bottom of the standings, while Orlando is trying to stay in the playoff picture.Injuries will influence this game. The Nets are missing their leading scorer, and the Magic will be without one of their main forwards. Recent meetings, team trends, and available depth provide a clearer sense of what to expect.Brooklyn Nets has five players ruled out and no game-time decisions.Cam Thomas is out for personal reasons, removing the team’s primary scoring threat. Haywood Highsmith is still recovering from right knee surgery and is not close to returning. Tyson Etienne, Chaney Johnson, and E.J. Liddell are unavailable due to G League two-way assignments, leaving the Nets with limited depth at guard and forward.With no questionable players listed, the rotation is mostly set, though short.Orlando Magic will also be without two players but does not have any uncertain statuses.Franz Wagner remains out with a left high ankle sprain, affecting the team’s scoring, playmaking, and defensive flexibility.Colin Castleton is unavailable on a two-way assignment, reducing depth behind Wendell Carter Jr. and Bol Bol.Paolo Banchero is expected to carry more of the offense, while Jalen Suggs and Cole Anthony should take on larger ball-handling roles.Orlando leads the all-time regular-season series with 77 wins to Brooklyn’s 60 across 137 games, helped by strong runs in the 2000s and early 2010s.The teams have already played at least once this season, with Orlando generally controlling the matchup. Defense, rebounding, and transition scoring have helped the Magic create separation in competitive games. With Brooklyn again missing Cam Thomas, Orlando enters this contest in a stronger position.Brooklyn averages about 113-115 points per game while shooting roughly 45-46% from the field. The offense relies heavily on three-point attempts, producing around 15 makes per game at about 35%.Defense has been a consistent problem. Opponents score approximately 125-128 points per night, and the Nets rank near the bottom of the league in defensive rating. Transition defense and second-chance coverage remain areas of concern.Without Thomas, half-court scoring becomes harder, often shifting responsibility to Nic Claxton and supporting guards who have been less efficient.Orlando scores around 114-116 points per game on 47-48% shooting. The team averages about 13-14 made threes at a 35-36% rate but generates much of its offense inside and on the break.The Magic allow roughly 110-112 points per game and rate well defensively. Carter Jr. and Bol Bol help control the boards and protect the rim, giving Orlando a steady defensive base.Brooklyn’s guards vs Orlando’s perimeter defenseWith Thomas unavailable, the scoring burden moves to available guards such as D’Angelo Russell, along with rotation players like Ryan Dunn or Jordan Walsh. Suggs and Anthony will try to pressure ball handlers, limit drives, and force difficult shots while Orlando looks to run after turnovers.Nic Claxton faces a physical challenge against Carter Jr. and Bol Bol. Orlando’s size could lead to an advantage on the glass and create extra possessions.Brooklyn is likely to rely on a tighter lineup because of injuries. Orlando has more flexibility and can stagger minutes to keep its main players fresh late in the game.Brooklyn’s offense without Cam Thomas will be a major factor. Shot creation and efficiency will determine whether the Nets can stay close.Orlando’s transition play is another area to watch.

A turnaround season for New Orleans Saints

How Tyler Shough changed the narrative

New Orleans Saints quarterback Tyler Shough has added a major honor to his debut NFL season. The 26-year-old has been named the Pepsi Zero Sugar NFL Rookie of the Year, an award decided by fan voting across the league.The announcement came just hours before the annual NFL Honors ceremony, creating some confusion among fans about whether Shough had officially won the Associated Press Offensive Rookie of the Year award. However, the fan-voted honor is separate from the AP award, which is decided by a panel of 50 media members.The recognition marks a big milestone in what turned out to be a breakthrough season for the Saints’ young quarterback. Shough did not begin the season as the Saints’ starting quarterback. He stepped into the spotlight in Week 8 after replacing Spencer Rattler and quickly changed the direction of the team’s campaign.Once he became the starter, New Orleans finished the season with a 5-4 record over the final nine games. During that stretch, Shough completed nearly 69 percent of his passes, averaging around 250 yards per game. He threw 10 touchdowns, six interceptions, and added three rushing scores.What made his performance more impressive was the situation around him. The Saints dealt with multiple injuries, including key offensive players like Alvin Kamara and Rashid Shaheed missing time. The team also relied on several practice squad players in the second half of the season.Despite those challenges, Shough showed calmness in the pocket, strong decision-making, and leadership beyond his rookie status.“It’s an honor to be recognized by the fans,” Shough said in a team statement. “I couldn’t have done it without my teammates and coaches supporting me all season.”When the Saints selected Shough with the 40th overall pick in the 2026 NFL Draft, many questioned the decision. Some believed the team reached too early for a quarterback.Shough completed 67.6 percent of his passes for 2,384 yards in his rookie season. While his numbers may not have led the league, his impact was clear. He helped transform the Saints from a struggling squad into a competitive team with hope for the future.The fan-voted award also places him in notable company. Past winners include established quarterbacks who went on to have strong NFL careers.Shough is also a finalist for the Associated Press Offensive Rookie of the Year award, which will be announced during NFL Honors. Whether or not he wins that honor, his rookie campaign has already made a strong statement.Under head coach Kellen Moore, the Saints appear to have found their quarterback of the future. With a full offseason to prepare as the clear starter, expectations will only grow.",Tyler shough has been named the pepsi zero sugar nfl rookie of the year. The award is decided by fan voting across the league.

Chicago Bulls vs Toronto Raptors Betting and Game Outlook (February 5, 2026)

Theon Thursday in a meeting between two teams trying to stay competitive in the Eastern Conference playoff race. Neither side has found sustained form this season, and both are dealing with roster changes that have affected continuity.This is an important game in which Chicago will be playing after multiple trades and injuries decided the rotation. On the other hand, Toronto is managing its own absences. With several regular contributors unavailable, this matchup is likely to depend on how each team deals with absences and rotation fillers rather than star power.The Chicago Bulls are adjusting to a roster that looks very different from earlier in the season.• Zach Collins - Right first-toe sprain• Ayo Dosunmu - Not with team (trade-related)• Noa Essengue - Recovering from left-shoulder surgery• Josh Giddey - Left hamstring strain• Tre Jones - Left hamstring strain• Julian Phillips - Not with team (trade-related)• Dalen Terry - Not with team (trade-related)• Nikola Vucevic - Not with team (trade-related)• Ousmane Dieng - Trade pending• Collin Sexton - Trade pendingProbable / Expected to Play• Jaden Ivey - ProbableChicago is expected to rely more on younger guards, and the frontcourt depth is limited.Toronto Raptors is also dealing with availability issues, particularly in the paint.• RJ Barrett - Managed right-knee sprain• Jakob Poeltl - Lower-back strain• Chucky Hepburn - G League assignment• A.J. Lawson - G League assignment• Ayo Dosunmu - Bilateral quad-tendon issue• Tre Jones - Left hamstring strainWithout Barrett and Poeltl, Toronto loses a primary scorer on the wing and its main rim protector. That places more responsibility on the backcourt.• Chicago Bulls - 4 wins• Toronto Raptors - 0 winsChicago has won each matchup by an average of about 7.5 points and has outscored Toronto by roughly 15 points per 100 possessions.• Total games: 110• Bulls wins: 61• Raptors wins: 49Chicago is 24-27, placing 10th in the East and third in the Central Division.• Points per game: ~117.2• Field-goal percentage: ~47.3%• Three-point percentage: ~36.8%• Turnovers: ~14.4Ball movement remains a strength, but the absence of Nikola Vucevic and the injury to Josh Giddey have shifted more creation to the perimeter.• Points allowed: ~120.2• Rebounds: ~45.3 (3rd in NBA)• Net rating: about -3.0The Bulls rebound well but have struggled defensively, especially around the rim and on perimeter rotations.Toronto is close to the .500 mark with results largely driven by defense.• Points per game: mid-110s• Three-point shooting: roughly 34-35%• Assists: just over 28The offense relies on pick-and-roll sets and transition scoring, but outside shooting and turnovers have limited efficiency.• Points allowed per 100 possessions: around 113-114• Net rating: slightly positiveToronto defends the perimeter effectively, though Poeltl’s absence reduces interior protection.With Giddey, Jones, and Collins out, Chicago will depend on Jaden Ivey and its remaining ball-handlers to attack the defense and create second-chance opportunities. The Bulls’ rebounding advantage could matter against a smaller Toronto lineup.Toronto is likely to push the pace and force contested shots. Defensive communication and help coverage will be important without a traditional interior anchor.Rebounding and second-chance points favor Chicago, while Toronto may attempt more three-pointers despite a lower percentage. Based on the season series and current injuries, the spread is expected to lean slightly toward the Bulls.Both teams enter the game dealing with lineup changes and missing players. Chicago has controlled the season series, but Toronto’s defense has kept games competitive. The result may come down to which team handles the rotation gaps more effectively and executes late in the game.","Chicago bulls host the toronto raptors on february 5, 2026.
