Operation Sindoor: 2 BSF personnel awarded Vir Chakra posthumously; 16 others to get gallantry medal,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/operation-sindoor-2-bsf-personnel-awarded-vir-chakra-posthumously-16-others-to-get-gallantry-medal/articleshow/123323309.cms,"NEW DELHI: Two BSF martyrs will be conferred Vir Chakra and 16 other personnel, police gallantry medals for having fought shoulder-to-shoulder with the armed forces during Operation Sindoor , successfully defending sensitive border posts in Jammu and Kashmir and destroying enemy posts and their surveillance equipment in firm retaliatory action.Both the Vir Chakra awardees -- late Sub-Inspector Mohd Imteyaj and late Constable Deepak Chingakham -- will be honoured for valiantly defending the highly-sensitive border outpost Kharkola in Jammu, which is barely 200 m from the international border, against intense shelling and drone attacks by the enemy. BSF troops led by post commander Imteyaj mounted a precise and resolute retaliation, inflicting heavy damages to the counterpart post and their gun positions. During the wee hours of May 10, Imteyaj spotted rogue drones intruding over Kharkola with an intent to drop explosive payloads or guide mortar fire, and tactically moved out from the bunker and reorganised his troops to successfully neutralise an enemy drone. Constable Deepak Chigakham moved along with his 'buddy' Imteyaz. However a mortal shell, likely dropped by the drone, exploded, causing grievous splinter injuries to Imteyaz, Deepak and two others.Not the ones to give up, both Imteyaz and Deepap continued fighting. While Imteyaz motivated the troops, Deepak crawled unaided to the morcha and held his position. Both the bravehearts were later evacuated to Army hospital in Jammu but succumbed to their injuries.The home ministry meanwhile announced that 16 BSF personnel – Assistant Commandants (ACs) Abhishek Srivastav and Alok Negi; Deputy Commandant (DC) Ravindra Rathore; Inspector Devi Lal; Sub-Inspector (SI) Vyas Dev; Assistant Sub-Inspectors (ASIs) Udai Vir Singh and Rajappa BT; Head Constables (HCs) Brij Mohan Singh and Sahib Singh; and Constables (CT) Bhupendra Kumar Bajpai, Rajan Kumar, Basavaraja Shivappa Sunkada, Depeswar Barman, Suddi Rabha, Kanwaraj Singh and Manohar Xalxo – will be conferred medals for five separate gallant actions undertaken between May 7 and 10 on the international border in J&K. Braving injuries and high-risk challenges, the honoured ‘Seema Praharis’ had challenged the adversary with precision strikes, helped replenish ammunition supplies and ensured that their fellow BSF personnel and posts were safe.Seven of the 16 gallantry medal awardees are being honoured as well for their valiant action in Kharkola outpost. As AC Abhishek Srivastav, along with HC Brij Mohan Singh and constables Bhupendra Bajpai, Rajan Kumar, Basavaraja Shivappa Sunkada and Depeswar Barman, retaliated against heavy shelling from Pakistan, even neutralising one of their drones, an enemy mortar shell exploded just outside of the morcha, causing grievous injuries to Singh, Barman, Bajpai, Kumar and Sunkada. AC Srivastav, who was under probation training, fearlessly rushed towards the injured post commander and jawans and managed their evacuation.AC Alok Negi, during intense enemy fire at FDL Mukhyari from May 7 to 20, 2025, led defensive action, repositioned personnel and mortar assets and coordinated precise retaliatory strikes on key enemy posts. Constables Chowdhury and Waghmare executed relentless and accurate fire, significantly blunting enemy positions.ASI Udai Vir Singh, during a heavy assault by Pakistan on BOP Jabowal, Jammu Sector on May 10, 2025, successfully destroyed a Pakistani surveillance camera, denying real-time monitoring of BOP’s and troops movement. Despite sustaining a life-threatening shrapnel wound to his upper lip from HMG fire, he refused evacuation and continued engaging the enemy, neutralising their HMG nest.SI Vyas Dev and Constable Suddi Rabha deployed in forward posts in Jammu area were detailed for replenishment of ammunition to forward troops. During this risk prone mission, an enemy 82 mortar shell exploded near them causing multiple splinter injuries to both. Dev remained conscious, stabilised himself and, along with Suddi, continued the mission. Dev's left leg had to be amputated later.Deputy commandant Ravindra Rathore and his team — Inspector Devi Lal, HC Sahib Singh and constable Kanwaraj Singh — successfully implemented an operation for the safety of a BSF Jawan whose life was in peril.During a coordinated assault by Pakistani troops on May 9-10 on BSF BOPs Karotana Khurd, Karotana Forward and Suchetgarh, BOP Karotana Khurd reported a critical shortage of AGS ammunition. ASI(GD) Rajappa B T and CT(GD) Manohar Xalxo undertook the risky mission to resupply ammunition but a mortar shell exploded near the magazine, grievously injuring Rajappa and wounding Xalxo’s right hand. Still, both completed the task.","Two bsf martyrs will be conferred vir chakra and 16 other personnel, police gallantry medals.

Travis Hunter divorce rumors spark fan backlash at social media’s obsession,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/travis-hunter-divorce-rumors-spark-fan-backlash-at-social-medias-obsession/articleshow/123326235.cms,"(Image via Getty Images)

Rumors about Travis Hunter’s divorce have taken over social media feeds



Fans are calling out the obsession, labeling it ‘weird’ and ‘invasive’



“Y’all are way too invested in someone else’s marriage,”

“Why does this even matter to you?”

When did we, as a collective, decide that an athlete’s alleged marriage drama was worth a nationwide magnifying glass? That’s the question fans are now asking as rumors about Colorado football star Travis Hunter’s supposed divorce keep popping up online. While the internet thrives on a little gossip, many are calling out just how creepy the obsession has gotten and they’re not wrong.The talk started with a few cryptic posts and quickly turned into a full-blown internet frenzy. Multiple accounts began hinting that Hunter and his wife might be calling it quits, with screenshots and speculation flying faster than a 40-yard dash but here’s the thing, there’s been no official confirmation from either Hunter or his wife. This hasn’t stopped gossip pages from turning every comment, every photo, and every absence from Instagram into “proof” of a split.Not everyone’s here for the drama. In fact, a growing number of fans have started pushing back, saying the whole thing feels uncomfortably personal.one fan wrote, while another bluntly asked,Others pointed out the double standard when regular people get divorced, nobody cares, but when it’s a celebrity athlete, suddenly everyone’s a private investigator.Sure, the public has always been curious about celebrity breakups. From reality TV stars to A-list actors, messy splits tend to get clicks. But with Hunter, a 21-year-old still building his career, fans say the narrative feels uncomfortably invasive especially when it’s based on nothing confirmed. The constant picking apart of his personal life is leaving some wondering if sports fans are crossing the line from curiosity into obsession.Hunter is coming off an explosive season at Colorado and has already cemented himself as one of college football’s most electrifying players. Yet, instead of hyping up his on-field performance, parts of the internet are deep-diving into his personal relationships. In the end, it’s a reminder that athletes are still people and no matter how famous they are, their relationships deserve the same respect and privacy as anyone else’s.Also read - Travis Hunter injury update: Jaguars may sit rookie star for preseason Game 2","Rumors about colorado football star travis hunter’s supposed divorce keep popping up online.

Poll Do you think Vanessa Bryant handled the pregnancy rumors well? Yes, very cleverly No, she should have addressed them directly

Met Gala Surprise: Rihanna Stuns With Baby Bump Reveal, A$AP Rocky Confirms It’s Baby No 3

After days of unrelenting speculation, Vanessa Bryant took to Instagram Stories on Sunday, June 1, to put the rumors to rest. Her response wasn’t a press statement or a legal warning, it was a wild meme with a big middle finger to the internet trolls. The meme featured music icon Rihanna floating in water with a snorkel mask on her head, holding a drink, and flipping her middle finger.“Me protecting my peace, not pregnant & having fun all summer,” Vanessa Bryant wrote in the caption on her response to the online trolls who spread her pregnancy rumors about five years after her husband, Kobe Bryant ’s, untimely and devastating demise.It was clear, clever, and vintage Vanessa who shut down noise without saying a word about the origin of the gossip. No press release needed when you’ve got Rihanna energy with a direct middle finger gesture.The rumors had emerged out of nowhere, with some users pointing to photos allegedly showing a ""baby bump,"" though no timestamps or context were attached to those images. Vanessa hasn't been publicly linked to anyone romantically, and there’s been zero confirmation from her side—until now.In another Instagram Story later that evening, Vanessa shared a motivational quote that hinted at how she views the entire situation and what matters to her personally.“The only way to impress me, is by being a good person,” the quote read. “I don’t care what you have, what you wear, where you live, or what you drive. I just have deep respect for people with pure hearts and good intentions.”Adding one final touch to her trilogy of clapbacks, she posted another Rihanna meme, this one stating, “I’m not mean, I’m just not the one.”With the classic Rihanna memes, Vanessa showed that she is busy being a proud mom to her daughters while being the powerhouse of her business ventures. While she does not care about the rumor mill, her reaction explicitly showed that she is urging privacy.Vanessa Bryant, who shares four daughters with Kobe— Natalia, Bianka, Capri, and the late Gianna— has remained devoted to family and philanthropy. Most recently, she shared footage of a joyful family ski trip over the holidays, showing the tight-knit bond she maintains with her children.Natalia Bryant stepped into the fashion world just like her mother, officially joining IMG Models in 2021 at the age of 18. “Ever since I can remember, I wanted to model,” she shared in a statement posted by IMG on Instagram. “There is a lot to learn, but I feel this is a great opportunity for me to learn and express myself creatively.”Vanessa and Kobe Bryant tied the knot in April 2001. Tragically, in January 2020, Kobe and their 13-year-old daughter Gianna lost their lives in a helicopter crash that also killed seven others. They were headed to Kobe’s Mamba Sports Academy for a youth basketball game when the accident occurred. Kobe was 41 at the time. The loss shook the sports world and left a lasting impact on fans, friends, and loved ones across the globe. Kobe has left a huge legacy to his name as well, he is considered one the of the elite NBA superstars of all time with astounding stats, records and intense playmaking abilities. His demise created a huge void in the NBA world as fans are still mourning his untimely passing.Since their passing, she’s kept their memory alive through meaningful business ventures and charitable work. Kobe launched the Mamba Sports Foundation in 2016, aiming to support young athletes. After his death, Vanessa renamed it the Mamba & Mambacita Sports Foundation in honor of both Kobe and Gianna. Today, the foundation helps underserved boys and girls in sports, pushing forward the mission they believed in. It's her way of carrying on their legacy with purpose and heart.Vanessa Bryant’s response was indeed witty and empowering as she hinted that she deserves privacy and reminded the world that while she may be a public figure, her peace and dignity aren’t up for debate, especially not over unfounded gossip. After the viral response via memes, Vanessa has seemingly closed the chapter as she did not extend the matter any further with any other comments about it afterwards.Days after shutting down the pregnancy rumor, Vanessa Bryant made a glowing courtside appearance with her daughters at the New York Liberty vs. Chicago Sky game. The WNBA shared a sweet clip showing Vanessa alongside Natalia, 22, Bianka, 8, and Capri, 5, all smiling and waving for the camera.Later, Vanessa uploaded an image of her in a restaurant, candidly posing as she waited for the food to be arrive. Considering the dress, it appears that the photograph was shot after her recent attendance in the game.Their family moment quickly caught fans’ attention online, adding a warm highlight to the evening. It was a rare and heartwarming public outing for the Bryant family, showing their strong support for women’s basketball. It was Vanessa's first public outing since she debunked the horrendous pregnancy rumors.Recently, Vanessa honored her husband Kobe's memory with a heartfelt Instagram post on Instagram, sharing a throwback photograph of the family with the NBA legend, ""Happy Fathers Day @kobebryant 💕 You are so missed. We love you so much. #GirlDad 💕💕""Earlier this July, Vanessa Bryant added another heartfelt moment to her social media with a birthday post for her sister, Sophie. The sweet throwback photo featured Vanessa, her late husband Kobe Bryant, and Sophie together, smiling during happier times. It comes after several touching family updates, including daughter Natalia’s recent USC graduation and emotional tribute to her dad.As for her fortune, Vanessa's net worth has seen major growth over the years. While Kobe Bryant’s NBA success helped build their fortune, Vanessa carved her own path, too. She’s earned recognition as a model, businesswoman, and philanthropist, adding to her wealth through years of steady work.As of 2025, her estimated net worth is $600 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth. A large portion of that came from Kobe’s estate, after his tragic passing in 2020. At the time, Forbes valued the Lakers legend’s net worth at $600 million.Vanessa just shared a sweet throwback-inspired moment that melted hearts online. Her youngest daughter, Capri, recreated one of Kobe Bryant’s most iconic photos from 1999—wearing a cast and pajamas just like her dad did after a wrist injury. Vanessa captioned the photo, “Like father, like daughter. 💜 Capri Kobe Bryant 💜 #BabyMamba #KokoBean 💜💛🐍,” reminding fans how Kobe’s spirit lives on through their kids. From raising her children to keeping Kobe's memory alive, Vanessa has been an example of love and a remarkable parent. Also, there is no report of her seeing anyone as she remains loyal to her beloved husband Kobe, cherishing his legacy with their kids.Vanessa Bryant’s newest tribute arrives just months after she shared memories from a snowy holiday getaway with her daughters. Last December, she posted sweet moments on Instagram—showing the girls toasting marshmallows and skiing through the snow. Little Capri even shared a carousel ride with Vanessa, making the winter trip extra special.Additionally, Vanessa Bryant also grabs headlines for her friendship with several celebrities including Ciara, she often comments and likes the posts of her friends on social media. As of now, Vanessa is keeping a low profile about her personal life like always.Recently, Vanessa Bryant touched hearts with a heartfelt tribute to Kobe Bryant, joined by daughters Natalia, Bianka, and Capri during the Dodgers’ Bobblehead Night. She shared sweet photos from the emotional occasion, and her Instagram post celebrating Kobe Bryant’s legacy quickly drew an outpouring of love from fans.Recently, They partnered with @baby2baby and their Angel, @vanessabryant, to take part in a special Back-to-School Celebration for the incredible students of Ninth Street Elementary in Los Angeles.Also Read: Is Vanessa Bryant pregnant with her 5th child?

Themay be heading toward a roster shake-up before the 2025-26 NBA season concludes, with reports suggesting power forwardcould be on the trade block. While the Lakers have publicly expressed satisfaction with their current lineup, ongoing trade rumors hint that the front office is still searching for the right mix of talent to maximize Luka Doncic’s championship window.According to RB Hayek of ClutchPoints, Vanderbilt’s combination of strong perimeter defense but limited offensive production might not fit the direction head coach JJ Redick wants to take the team. Hayek wrote: “Jarred Vanderbilt may be out of time in LA. Sadly, the Lakers forward is just not cutting it. He averaged 4.1 points and 5.1 rebounds per game during the 2024-25 season while shooting 48.8 percent from the hardwood. However, Vanderbilt only averaged 1.4 points per game during the playoffs and shot 33.3 percent over five games.”While his defense remains a strength, Vanderbilt’s inability to consistently contribute on the offensive end could make him expendable, especially if the Lakers want a more balanced two-way player in their rotation. Jarred Vanderbilt is under contract for $10.7 million through next season, giving the Lakers some flexibility if they decide to move him. His deal could be used in a trade package to bring in players who offer more scoring punch and have a stronger track record of staying healthy.While the Los Angeles Lakers may not fetch a significant return for Vanderbilt, moving him could open up a valuable roster spot for a player with more offensive upside. Given the competitive Western Conference, every roster decision could play a crucial role in positioning the team for a deep playoff run.Possible motivations for a trade:• Acquire a more versatile forward who can contribute offensively and defensively• Improve injury reliability in the frontcourt rotation• Create cap flexibility for midseason movesAlso read: NBA Mock Trade: Los Angeles Lakers Land $121 Million Golden State Warriors Big Man in Blockbuster Swap for LeBron James Vanderbilt’s journey in Los Angeles started with promise, but his offensive limitations and recent playoff struggles have raised questions about his long-term fit.

Offensive changes give Oklahoma Sooners a real upside this fall



Brent Venables is back in charge of the defense and Klatt thinks that’s a good thing



The brutal SEC schedule is the big concern

FOX Sports analyst and former quarterback of the Colorado Buffaloes, Joel Klatt, sees Oklahoma Sooners as one of college football’s biggest wild cards in 2025. With a revamped offense and a proven defensive mind taking over again, the Sooners look stronger on paper. But as much as Klatt likes the pieces in Norman, he’s not convinced they’re set for a College Football Playoff run – and the schedule is his main concern. Klatt ranked Oklahoma No. 24 in his preseason Top 25 and recently broke down his reasoning on The Joel Klatt Show, where he called OU a potential playoff sleeper – with a major “but.”Joel Klatt’s optimism starts with the offensive overhaul. After one of the worst scoring outputs in the SEC last year, the Sooners are turning to former Washington State QB John Mateer and his OC Ben Arbuckle to fix it. ""I love the additions on offense. John Mateer is a guy I’m very impressed with. I’ve talked about him at length this offseason. (Ben) Arbuckle, his offensive coordinator at Washington State, also joins him in Norman there. Their offense should be better. It was bad last year. The film was some of the worst that I’ve ever seen, to be honest with you,"" Klatt said.Oklahoma’s offense struggled badly last season, averaging just 13 points per SEC game without help from the defense and ranking 97th nationally.New quarterback John Mateer doesn’t need to match the 4,000 yards and 44 touchdowns he had at Washington State, but even coming close would be a big upgrade. The Sooners also brought in star running back Jaydn Ott, new playmakers at receiver and tight end and experienced linemen to help fix a weak offensive line.On defense, Brent Venables is calling the shots again. ""Defense improved. The defense has steadily improved. Venables will be the play-caller on the defensive side for OU this year. I like that. I really like that. He’s entering his fourth season. We’ve seen them have a double-digit win season under Venables. So, can it happen? Absolutely,"" Klatt said. After a year with Zac Alley as defensive coordinator, Venables is taking over play-calling again following Alley’s departure.Even with improvement on both sides, Klatt isn’t predicting a playoff run – and he is clear why. ""Here’s the problem. If they had a more favorable schedule, like Auburn’s? I think I would probably pick them (as a CFP sleeper) right here,"" Klatt said. ""But I can’t, in good conscience, pick them with what their schedule is... They’re not making this jump... I don’t like it... While I think they can improve, I don’t think they’ll make enough of an improvement, as it relates to their schedule, which we don’t talk about enough, to go to the playoff. ""OU faces Michigan early, then battles through Texas, Alabama, LSU, Tennessee, Auburn, Ole Miss, Missouri, and South Carolina. Even a much-improved roster will struggle to navigate that slate.There’s real excitement around Oklahoma’s offseason moves. But unless they can break through one of the toughest schedules in the country, a return to the CFP will remain just out of reach.","Brent venables returns to calling defensive plays for the oklahoma sooners in the 2025 season.

Jaccob Slavin key to Hurricanes’ Stanley Cup push

Jaccob Slavin’s reputation as one of the NHL’s elite blueliners continues to grow, with the Carolina Hurricanes star earning the No. 8 spot on NHL Network’s list of the “Top-20 Players Right Now” among defensemen. The ranking marks a significant leap from last year, when Slavin was placed at No. 13.Slavin’s five-spot jump in the rankings is a testament to his consistency, defensive IQ, and leadership on and off the ice. From representing Team USA at the 4 Nations Face-Off to anchoring the Hurricanes’ blue line, Slavin has solidified his status as one of the most effective shutdown defensemen in the league.Hurricanes General Manager Eric Tulsky praised Slavin’s impact, stating, “Jaccob might be the best defender in the NHL, and he has already cemented himself as one of the best players ever to put on a Hurricanes uniform. He is a crucial leader for our team, both on and off the ice, and keeping him in Carolina long term was a top priority.”Slavin’s defensive style is defined by his impeccable positioning, smooth skating, and ability to neutralize elite forwards without taking unnecessary penalties. This past season, the 31-year-old posted six goals, 21 assists, and 27 points in 80 games while averaging 21:34 in ice time — numbers that highlight his two-way dependability.The list of defensemen ranked ahead of Slavin underscores the level of competition at the position. Cale Makar, Quinn Hughes, Zach Werenski, Miro Heiskanen, Victor Hedman, Josh Morrissey, and Rasmus Dahlin all placed higher, but Slavin’s continued improvement suggests he could climb even further in the years ahead.Known for his quiet leadership, Slavin rarely makes flashy plays for highlight reels, but his reliability has been a cornerstone of Carolina’s success. His ability to read plays, disrupt offensive threats, and transition the puck effectively makes him invaluable in both 5-on-5 situations and on the penalty kill.Also Read: Connor McDavid contract rumors: $17 Million Oilers deal could set new NHL salary record As the Hurricanes continue their push for the Stanley Cup, Slavin’s elite defensive play will be critical.

Pittsburgh Penguins face the Gavin McKenna dilemma



Pittsburgh Penguins' roster upgrades make tanking ambitions difficult



Penguins’ Dream Prospect? Gavin McKenna Commits to Penn State

Competition for Gavin McKenna will be intense



With the 2025-26 NHL season looming on the horizon, the Pittsburgh Penguins are looking into a crossroads—and it will shape their future for decades to come. One road is the prospect of Gavin McKenna, the biggest hyped draft prospect since Connor McDavid. The other is the temptation to get a last playoff push out of an aging core headlined by Sidney Crosby.The dilemma? The Pittsburgh Penguins may not be bad enough to acquire Gavin McKenna or good enough to mount a meaningful Stanley Cup charge. That ""mushy middle"" will leave them stagnant, and in a season where several franchises are publicly rebuilding, remaining static may prove to be the worst move of all.On the surface, the Pittsburgh Penguins' roster isn't filled with Stanley Cup confidence. They still lack answers on the net and an exposed blue line—or so it seems if Erik Karlsson is traded ahead of opening night on Oct. 7. But up front, the Pittsburgh Penguins have quietly improved.Rickard Rakell and Bryan Rust are having career years and should continue to be productive alongside Crosby. Scoring depth is provided by free-agent acquisition Anthony Mantha, and Tommy Novak should help the offense with a healthy season after sitting out much of his time with Pittsburgh last year.There is also a crop of young players vying for spots on the roster. Ville Koivunen and Rutger McGroarty showed promise at the end of last season, and Tristan Broz, Avery Hayes, and Filip Hallander might bring the kind of depth and energy most bottom-of-the-barrel teams never see.With modest gains in net—provided by the addition of Arturs Silovs and the growth of prospects Joel Blomqvist and Sergei Murashov—Pittsburgh is perhaps too competitive to slip into the bottom five, even without an intentional push for victories.The actual issue with any Penguins tanking scheme? Other teams are much more interested in losing. The Buffalo Sabres, Chicago Blackhawks, Anaheim Ducks, Seattle Kraken, and San Jose Sharks all seem set to suffer another miserable season, while clubs such as the Detroit Red Wings, Vancouver Canucks, and New York Islanders are mired in their respective transition phases.If Kyle Dubas wants McKenna, Pittsburgh would need to make drastic changes—perhaps trading Karlsson, Rakell, or Rust—to fall far enough in the standings.Also read: Sidney Crosby's enduring greatness: How the Pittsburgh Penguins icon continues to rewrite NHL history For the time being, the Penguins' path is uncertain.

Bishop’s role depends on a quick recovery and strong performance

As the Buffalo Bills navigate the NFL offseason and prepare for training camp, safety Cole Bishop’s injury status has become a pressing topic. The second-round pick from the 2024 NFL Draft was expected to be a key piece in the Bills’ defensive backfield this season. However, setbacks in the preseason have cast a shadow on his availability, forcing the team to reconsider their safety depth. Head coach Sean McDermott recently spoke about Bishop’s situation and the limited time left for the young safety to make an impact before the regular season begins.Coming out of the University of Utah, Cole Bishop was selected by Buffalo in the second round, joining his former college teammate and Bills tight end Dalton Kincaid in the 2024 draft class. Buffalo’s general manager, Brandon Beane, has reshaped the roster to manage the salary cap while bringing in players expected to contribute quickly. Bishop fit that mold, offering speed and coverage ability in the safety role, a position critical to the Bills’ defense.During his rookie year, Bishop played behind starter Damar Hamlin but steadily gained experience. Despite an injury setback early in his first training camp, Bishop’s performance over the season earned him more snaps and attention.This offseason, he impressed and moved ahead of Hamlin on the depth chart and was slated to start at safety heading into preseason action.The momentum Bishop had built was interrupted by a quad injury that caused him to miss six practices plus the opening preseason game. This absence has raised concerns within the coaching staff about how quickly he can return to full form. “Cole has missed quite a bit of time… It remains to be seen what he is truly able to do for us,” McDermott said, adding, “We’re getting short on time.”The safety position has seen other injuries as well, with Taylor Rapp also sidelined during preseason. Still, according to Buffalo’s first unofficial depth chart, Bishop holds the starting job, signaling the team’s confidence in him once he is healthy.Even if Bishop isn’t fully ready at the season’s kickoff, he is expected to play significant snaps, starting alongside Rapp when both are available. His solid showing late last season and progress in the offseason program give the Bills hope he can live up to his draft status.Bishop’s health and ability to contribute could play a pivotal role in the team’s defensive success in 2025.",Cole bishop was a second-round pick from the 2024 nfl draft.

Gabe Davis could sign for New York Giants or Pittsburgh Steelers ?

Buffalo Bills or Kansas City Chiefs–which one’s suitable for Gabe Davis?

Gabe Davis could replace Rashee Rice at the Kansas City Chiefs

Davis played for the Buffalo Bills when they played against the Kansas City Chiefs.

The Chiefs saw Davis firsthand. He accumulated eight catches for 201 yards and four touchdowns in the 42-36 win by the Chiefs.

They have more than $20 million in cap space for 2025, despite extending right guard Trey Smith.

The Chiefs are known to bring players who have succeeded against them. Examples? RB Samaje Perine, who played for the Cincinnati Bengals, rushed for 106 yards in a win against the Kansas City Chiefs in the 2022 season. Chiefs’ head coach Andy Reid said, “We all know what he did to us when he was at Cincinnati with that screenplay.”

Davis could be an intriguing option for a Chiefs team that could need a position group that had seemed very stable before Rashee Rice’s incident.

The reigning NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year, who carried his team all the way to the NFC Championship Game in his debut season, brought long-lost hope to a fan base still healing from the Dan Snyder era. But when it comes to childcare, the 24-year-old quarterback still has some learning to do.Known for his calm composure in high-pressure games, Jayden Daniels looked anything but comfortable when handed teammate Mike Sainristil’s nearly 14-month-old daughter, Summer. The Heisman Trophy winner held her at arm’s length like an alien life form, clearly unsure of his next move. His discomfort didn’t go unnoticed, as he quickly returned Summer to her mom with the kind of speed Commanders fans usually see on his scrambles.The Commanders’ official Instagram had fun with the moment, captioning it: “Uncle Jayden reporting for duty 🫡.” Daniels, ever the good sport, smiled throughout the clip—though it’s safe to say he’s not ready for fatherhood just yet.For comparison, NFL MVP Josh Allen has been seen confidently carrying babies and toddlers, thanks to plenty of time spent with his young nephew. Daniels? Let’s just say his technique could use some preseason reps.Whether he’s awkwardly holding a toddler or leading a game-winning drive, Daniels remains a beloved figure in Washington.
