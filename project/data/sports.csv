A father’s sacrifice behind Rinku’s rise

NEW DELHI: Indian cricketer Rinku Singh suffered a heartbreaking personal loss on Friday morning as his father, Khanchand Singh, passed away at Yatharth Hospital in Greater Noida after battling advanced-stage liver cancer. He was on ventilator support for the past few days, hospital officials confirmed.Dr Sunil Kumar, spokesperson of the hospital, said Khanchand Singh’s condition had deteriorated significantly after being admitted on February 21. “He was placed on ventilator support and breathed his last early this morning,” Kumar stated. Family sources also confirmed the news, saying he had been fighting liver cancer for some time.Rinku, who is part of India’s T20 World Cup squad, had briefly returned home earlier in the tournament after his father’s health worsened following India’s Super 8 fixture against South Africa. Despite the emotional turmoil, the 28-year-old rejoined the squad in Chennai ahead of the Zimbabwe clash on February 26. Though he did not feature in the playing XI, he was present with the team during India’s convincing win.Former India spinner Harbhajan Singh expressed his condolences in a heartfelt post on X. “Pained to learn about the demise of Shri Khanchand Singh Ji, father of Rinku Singh. This must be an especially difficult time for Rinku and his family… May Waheguru grant eternal peace to the departed soul and give strength and courage to the bereaved family,” he wrote.Rinku’s former coach, Masood Amini, also confirmed the passing, noting that Khanchand Singh had been on ventilator support for the last three to four days.A resident of Aligarh in Uttar Pradesh, Rinku has often spoken about his father’s sacrifices. Khanchand Singh worked in gas cylinder distribution and supported his son’s cricketing ambitions despite financial hardships. In a touching moment last year, he attended Rinku’s engagement ceremony in Lucknow, even while battling illness. The cricketer is engaged to Samajwadi Party MP Priya Saroj.The last rites will be performed in Aligarh later in the day, with Rinku expected to attend.As India prepare for their upcoming clash against West Indies, cricket takes a backseat for the young batter, who now mourns the loss of the man he credits as his biggest pillar of strength.","Indian cricketer rinku singh's father, khanchand singh, passes away at hospital.

Matthew Tkachuk on Connor McDavid 's Olympic gold medal game



Florida Panthers forward Matthew Tkachuk did not hesitate when asked to describe his longtime rival following the Olympic final. Despite years of intense playoff battles, Tkachuk openly labeled Edmonton Oilers captain Connor McDavid as the best player in the world after their latest showdown on international ice.The praise came after Team USA’s dramatic victory over Canada in the gold medal game at the Milano Cortina 2026 Olympic Winter Games, adding another chapter to a rivalry shaped by Stanley Cup Finals clashes and high-stakes NHL matchups.After Team USA's close win over Canada, Matthew Tkachuk talked openly about how Connor McDavid has changed the game. The Florida Panthers star said that no other player has the same speed, vision, and puck control as the captain of the Edmonton Oilers.Tkachuk's words came after a key moment in the gold medal game. McDavid broke in alone on United States goaltender Connor Hellebuyck while Canada was behind and the game was still up for grabs. The play could have changed the course of the game and the story of the tournament.Instead, Hellebuyck made a key save that kept the Americans' small lead. Tkachuk later called the moment a turning point and said that stopping a player like McDavid on a breakaway takes calmness and perfect timing.The Florida Panthers forward said that if McDavid had scored, it might have changed the mood of the game. With veteran leader Sidney Crosby out because of an injury, the focus naturally turned to the captain of the Edmonton Oilers to step up for Canada.Team USA won gold in the end, but Tkachuk made it clear that he still respects McDavid. Their rivalry, which started in the Stanley Cup Finals and has continued through tough NHL games, is still a big part of this era of hockey.Tkachuk's comments are a reminder for fans who read the latest NHL news and updates: even fierce rivals can see greatness when they see it.","Matthew tkachuk said that connor mcdavid has the same speed, vision, and puck control as him.

India’s T20 World Cup semifinal qualification scenario



Can India and Pakistan meet again in T20 World Cup?



Could the cricket world be set for another blockbuster India vs Pakistan showdown at the T20 World Cup 2026? The possibility is still alive — but several pieces must fall into place.So far, South Africa national cricket team and England cricket team have confirmed their semi-final berths. That leaves two spots up for grabs, with India national cricket team, West Indies cricket team, Pakistan national cricket team and New Zealand national cricket team still in contention.England booked their place in the last four after a tense four-wicket win over New Zealand at the R Premadasa Stadium in Colombo, completing the Super Eights stage unbeaten with three wins from three matches to top Group 2.New Zealand sit second with three points. Pakistan, meanwhile, remain mathematically alive — but only just.For Pakistan to qualify, they must beat Sri Lanka in their final Super Eight fixture — and by a massive margin. Their Net Run Rate of -0.461 pales in comparison to New Zealand’s +1.390. Pakistan need a thumping win over Zimbabwe on Saturday.India, the defending champions, responded in style with a dominant 72-run victory over Zimbabwe at the MA Chidambaram Stadium.After West Indies’ heavy defeat to South Africa, the equation is simple for the Suryakumar Yadav-led side: defeat West Indies in their final Super Eight clash at Eden Gardens on March 1 and they are through to the semi-finals — irrespective of the margin.However, if rain forces a washout, West Indies would move to three points and seal qualification instead.An India-Pakistan clash is possible — but only if both teams make the knockouts.If Pakistan somehow finish in the top two of Group 2 and India qualify from their group, the two sides could face off in:The semi-final — depending on final group positions.The final — if both teams win their respective semi-finals.At present, India’s route appears clear-cut. Pakistan, on the other hand, require a dominant display and favourable results elsewhere to keep alive hopes of another high-voltage encounter between cricket’s fiercest rivals.","India, the defending champions, responded in style with a dominant 72-run victory over zimbabwe at the ma chidambaram stadium.

Bill Belichick’s longer hairstyle steals the spotlight in the stands as he attends the game with his girlfriend, Jordon Hudson

Bill Belichick has stayed in headlines well beyond the sidelines. Over the past two years, much of that attention has centered on his relationship with Jordon Hudson. The 73-year-old coach and the 24-year-old former college cheerleader first drew public interest after their romance became official in June 2024. Since then, every joint appearance has fueled debate and curiosity.Recently, the head coach was spotted at a game with Hudson, and this time it was not just their presence that caught attention. Belichick showed up with a noticeably new hairstyle. The look quickly went viral online and broke the internet with multiple reactions.Belichick kept his outfit simple, wearing a dark short-sleeve zip-up over a blue shirt. However, his grooming told a different story. He appears to be growing his hair long, with fuller strands brushing around the sides and back instead of the tight, cropped style fans knew from his New England Patriots era. The longer hair gave him a more relaxed, almost off-duty look as he greeted people and moved through the seating area with Hudson, who was dressed in all black and wore sunglasses to complete her look.As the look went viral, many fans poured in their reactions. A fan said, “Clinging to scraps.”Another added, “Yikes, Bill is growing his hair out. Guess what, BIG DEAL, HE CAN DO WHATEVER HE WANTS; HE IS AN ADULT.”One more fan added, “Bill Belichick with long hair?! 😳 Never thought we’d see the day… the man’s legendary on the field AND now making headlines off it too! 🏈👀"" A folk added, ""They make a nice couple.""Their relationship has stayed under the microscope. Reports state they first met in February 2021 on a flight from the Boston area to Florida. They were later seen together in January 2023, months before news of their romance surfaced publicly. Hudson, a former Bridgewater State University cheerleader and 2021 NCA Collegiate Champion, has supported Belichick at several major events, including NFL Honors in February 2025 and public outings tied to his coaching career.Public scrutiny has followed them, especially regarding their age gap. In April 2025, during a CBS Sunday Morning interview, Hudson firmly shut down personal questions about their relationship. Belichick later defended her in a statement, clarifying that he had asked for the focus to remain on his book.Now, with his long hair becoming a viral talking point, Belichick once again finds himself at the center of online chatter. This time, it is not about defense schemes or Super Bowl rings. It is about a hairstyle that signals a visible shift in the image of one of football’s most recognizable figures.","Bill belichick was spotted at a game with his girlfriend, jordon hudson.

He now leads the wicket charts this season with 60 wickets in 10 matches at an average of 12.56, including seven five-wicket hauls.In a post on X, Ganguly said Nabi should be considered for India’s white-ball tour of England in July 2026, where India are scheduled to play five T20Is and three ODIs.

NFL Rumors: Patriots set to pair Stefon Diggs and A.J. Brown with Drake Maye,https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/sports/nfl/news/nfl-rumors-patriots-set-to-pair-stefon-diggs-and-a-j-brown-with-drake-maye/articleshow/128862193.cms,"Image via AP Photo

What reports say about Stefon Diggs vs. A.J. Brown pairing

What it means for Drake Maye and the Patriots’ offense

The New England Patriots might be getting ready to make big changes to their offense before the 2026 NFL season. Several rumors say that the team is looking at trading for Philadelphia Eagles wide receiver A.J. Brown so that he may play with Stefon Diggs and inexperienced quarterback Drake Maye.After falling short in the Super Bowl, New England is expected to be aggressive in reshaping its roster, particularly at wide receiver. While Diggs led the team in production last season, the Patriots’ passing attack lacked consistent firepower, prompting the front office to evaluate elite options on the trade market.According to insiders, the Patriots have internal interest in trading for Brown, who remains one of the NFL’s top wideouts. The move would likely depend on contract adjustments, particularly Diggs potentially restructuring his deal to create salary-cap flexibility.Diggs is scheduled to carry a significant cap hit for the 2026 season, but he was still New England’s most productive receiver in 2025 with over 1,000 receiving yards. Rather than moving on from him, the team reportedly sees a scenario where both receivers can coexist.The Patriots’ leadership has also pointed to existing relationships as a factor.Head coach Mike Vrabel previously worked with Brown during their time with the Tennessee Titans, and that connection could play a role if trade talks advance.For Drake Maye, the addition of another elite receiver could accelerate his growth as the team’s franchise quarterback. Young passers often benefit from experienced playmakers, and a Diggs-Brown tandem would give New England one of the most balanced receiving groups in the league.Last season, the Patriots had trouble being consistent on offense, especially in important games. A better group of receivers might help open up the field, make the red zone more effective, and take some of the load off Maye to run the offense by himself.However, several hurdles remain. Philadelphia has not signaled strong willingness to move Brown, and any deal would require significant draft capital along with financial adjustments. Eagles general manager Howie Roseman recently emphasized Brown’s importance to the team, suggesting a trade is possible but unlikely without a compelling offer.Still, the idea of Diggs and Brown lining up together continues to generate buzz around the league. If New England can pull off the trade, it may be one of the most important personnel changes of the offseason and change how people think about the Patriots going into 2026.","The new england patriots are reportedly looking at trading for philadelphia eagles wide receiver a.j.

Broncos make $5.8 million contract decision on Ja’Quan McMillan after controversial Josh Allen interception

Ja’Quan McMillan is not going anywhere and the Denver Broncos have made a big $5.8 million contract decision on the defensive back who was at the center of the controversial Josh Allen interception in the AFC Divisional Round. According to ESPN NFL insider Jeremy Fowler, Denver is placing a second round tender worth $5.8 million on cornerback Ja’Quan McMillan. “Broncos are placing the second-round tender ($5.8M) on CB Ja’Quan McMillan, per sources,” Jeremy Fowler reported on ESPN. This means the Broncos keep control of the 25-year-old defender for now. It also means if another NFL team wants to sign him, they would have to give Denver a second round draft pick if the Broncos decide not to match the offer.Denver already has one of the strongest defenses in the NFL. While many fans are talking about changes on offense this offseason, the front office clearly does not want to weaken the secondary. Some veterans like Alex Singleton and John Franklin-Myers are hitting free agency, but bringing back Ja’Quan McMillan may have been even more important for depth and stability.Ja’Quan McMillan has quietly built a strong NFL career since entering the league as an undrafted free agent out of East Carolina in 2022. Over four seasons, he has recorded six interceptions, including two returned for touchdowns. Since 2022, he has added 24 passes defended, 195 total tackles, 16 tackles for loss, seven sacks, and nine quarterback hits. Opposing quarterbacks have posted an 84.6 passer rating when targeting him.He was also part of the much talked about play involving Buffalo Bills quarterback Josh Allen in the AFC Divisional Round. That interception sparked debate among fans, but it showed McMillan’s awareness and positioning in a huge playoff moment.With Patrick Surtain II, Riley Moss, and Jahdae Barron in the room, Denver’s cornerback group was viewed by many analysts as one of the best in football last season. Keeping Ja’Quan McMillan on the second round tender keeps that unit together.Here is how the tender works. McMillan can still talk to other teams. If a team offers him a contract, Denver can match it and keep him. If the Broncos choose not to match, they would receive a second round draft pick as compensation.In reality, giving up a second round pick is a high price. Because of that, many around the league believe Ja’Quan McMillan is likely to stay in Denver for at least one more season under the $5.8 million deal.

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander cleared to return but minutes likely monitored against Denver Nuggets

Shai Gilgeous-Alexander remains in the MVP race as the Oklahoma City Thunder race to the top

Tonight, the Denver Nuggets (37-22) head to the Paycom Center to play the Oklahoma City Thunder (45-15), a rematch of the exciting Western Conference semifinals from the previous year. OKC won the first encounter between these two teams this season, 121-111, in Denver, and this is only the second of four matchups.Fortunately, after a nine-game absence, Shai Gilgeous-Alexander is back. On Friday night, the Oklahoma City Thunder will meet the Denver Nuggets in a nationally televised game on ESPN, marking the superstar point guard's comeback from an abdominal strain. It's unclear, though, if Gilgeous-Alexander will have limited playing time throughout the match.ESPN will broadcast the Nuggets vs. Thunder game live on Friday from Oklahoma City, Oklahoma, at 9:30 p.m. ET. The Thunder have had a terrible season due to injuries. A crucial player returns tonight, but four of the Thunder's five starters have missed at least 11 games.Shai Gilgeous-Alexander, the current MVP, has received the all-clear to resume his abdominal injury. He has already missed 11 games, but he is still eligible for regular-season accolades if he misses six more.SGA is not yet on the team's injury report for Friday's game against the Denver Nuggets, according to Tim MacMahon of ESPN. As head coach Mark Daigneault attempts to ease his lead guard back into action, Gilgeous-Alexander, the current NBA MVP, will probably have his minutes monitored in some way even if he is off the injury report and will play a part in the game.However, Daigneault has not yet disclosed whether Gilgeous-Alexander will be subject to a minute restriction for the Denver game, which begins at 8:30 p.m. Central. The Thunder are still leading the Western Conference, after all. Their star player does not need to return to the court right away.However, considering that the Thunder's superior depth has shown itself able to handle his absence over the past several weeks, it is realistic to expect that Gilgeous-Alexander will be limited to about 25 minutes.Gilgeous-Alexander needs to miss just six more games this season to meet the NBA's 65-game requirement and be eligible for MVP and other postseason honors. The Thunder, however, had a 5-4 record in their nine games without SGA. Oklahoma City continues to hold the top spot in the Western Conference, two games ahead of San Antonio. Nonetheless, the Spurs hold the season tiebreaker between the two teams and have won ten straight games.Jalen Williams, an All-NBA forward, and Ajay Mitchell, an important role player, are still absent from the Thunder. However, Gilgeous-Alexander is within striking distance of Luka Doncic of the Los Angeles Lakers in the scoring battle after averaging 31.8 points per game in 49 games this season.","Oklahoma city thunder guard shai gilgeous-alexander has returned from an abdominal strain.

That event became extra special for her.However, her season was not perfect. She missed six meets due to injury. Still, she returned strong and proud.The most emotional moment came at the ACC Championship. Years ago, her father filmed her as a child and said she would one day compete on television. At the championship, that dream came true. McCright later shared the old video of her dad making that prediction. It was a full circle moment.Meanwhile, on Instagram, fans continue to support her.

Playing at the same venue



Facing spin



Team news



New Zealand middle-order batter Mark Chapman looked perplexed when he was asked about the Super Eight groups, where all four table-toppers, who have done well in their respective groups, will end up facing each other. It has been done because of the pre-tournament seedings.The 31-year-old smiled and replied, “When it comes to scheduling and planning, that’s not really in my domain.”Chapman’s response sums up the way New Zealand play their cricket. No fuss, no theatrics, just straight down to business.After playing three matches in Chennai and one in Ahmedabad, all on red-soil pitches, the Kiwis had only one training session to adapt to the conditions ahead of their first Super Eight match against Pakistan at the R Premadasa Stadium.None of them rushed towards the pitch for a closer look. Once warm-ups were done, the players moved to the indoor nets. About an hour later, Daryl Mitchell came out barefoot to inspect the surface, spending a good fifteen minutes studying every inch of the 22 yards.Chapman, who did not get to see the surface, left it to the senior leadership group.“In the subcontinent, the toss always plays a factor depending on the conditions.I haven’t seen the pitch yet, so I don’t actually know what it looks like. There will be discussions behind the scenes with the senior leadership group about what we want to do,” he said.The black-soil pitches in Colombo do assist spinners, and with bigger boundaries and a slower outfield, it presents a new challenge for the 2021 T20 World Cup finalists.“We haven’t played in Sri Lanka yet. A lot of guys in our team have played a lot of cricket here, so I don’t see that playing too much of a factor. Guys understand what they need to do, and we are confident we will face whatever conditions are in front of us,” said Chapman, whose knees were heavily strapped.“In India, particularly on red-soil pitches, conditions have been favourable for batting. It has been tough for the bowlers, and the margins have been very small. We have seen scores close to 200 regularly.“Here, it is slightly different with the slower nature of the pitches. The bowlers will hopefully get a chance to show their skills, and spinners are more likely to play a part here,” he added.Although Pakistan are stationed in Sri Lanka, they played their group matches at two different venues in Colombo.New Zealand will be the only team playing all their Super Eight matches at the same venue, facing Pakistan on February 21, Sri Lanka on February 25, and England on February 27, all at the R Premadasa Stadium.“One of the challenges in tournaments like these is hopping from venue to venue and adapting. When we play three games at the same place, we learn with each game.“It is nice to turn up at the same venue with similar pitches and adjust. Tomorrow is our first game here, so we will have to adapt anyway, but we will understand the conditions better as we go,” he said.New Zealand’s first challenge will be Pakistan’s spin-heavy attack. Usman Tariq, Abrar Ahmad, Mohammad Nawaz, Saim Ayub, and Shadab Khan form a strong unit.“Pakistan have a number of very good spinners, each with their own threat. We have played them quite frequently over the last few years.“We are well aware of what they will bring. For us, it is about being really clear in how we want to play against them,” he said.Obviously, there was a Usman Tariq question: “Usman Tariq has a unique action with the way he pauses at the crease, so that is something to factor in.""Chapman, whose role is to take on spinners in the middle overs, explained why running between the wickets will be crucial.“Given the slower pitch and bigger boundaries, you have to change your game plan. Against spinners, it is about different options like the sweep or reverse sweep. In India, you can target straight boundaries more.“For me, it is about finding different areas of the ground. There are big pockets here, so it is not all about sixes. Twos, fours, and running between the wickets are very important, especially if it is not a high-scoring game,” he said.New Zealand have suffered injury setbacks. Michael Bracewell has been ruled out of the remainder of the tournament after re-injuring his left calf. Captain Mitchell Santner missed the last group match against Canada due to illness, while Lockie Ferguson returned home for the birth of his first child.“Mitchell Santner looks pretty sprightly and excited to get back on the park, barring any last-minute illness.“Lockie has just returned and is coming off a long flight. We will see how he pulls up. I cannot confirm whether he will be in the playing eleven,” Chapman said.","New zealand will be the only team playing all their super eight matches at the same venue, facing pakistan on february 21, sri lanka on february 25, and england on february 27.

Luke Humphries laughs off rare ‘kirkulator’ error



Luke Humphries shared a light-hearted moment with referee Kirk Bevins during a tense quarter-final clash at Premier League Darts in Belfast. The world No 2 was facing Stephen Bunting on night four of the competition. While the match was competitive, a small scoring error from Bevins stole the spotlight early in the contest and left players and fans amused.Humphries eventually lost the match 6-4 as Bunting advanced to the semi-finals and later won the night. But it was a rare mistake from Bevins, known for his sharp maths skills, that became one of the talking points of the evening. The funny exchange between the player and the referee quickly went viral, with fans enjoying the human side of the high-pressure tournament.The incident happened when Luke Humphries was attempting to check out on 36. The 31-year-old missed his shots at double 18 and double nine. That left him in a position where he would go bust with his next throw. He decided to aim for 14 instead.However, Bevins made an unusual mistake. He called out “31” after the throw, which confused Humphries. The player looked at him with a puzzled expression. Realising the slip, Bevins quickly corrected himself and said “no score.”Humphries then jokingly stared at the referee. Bevins laughed as he brushed off the error. The moment brought smiles all around. Even the official social media account of the PDC highlighted the clip. They captioned it, “Even the Kirkulator gets it wrong sometimes.”Fans quickly reacted online. One supporter wrote that they had to rewind the clip to watch it again and noticed that the person sitting next to Bevins also seemed confused. Another fan joked that the mistake was serious enough to cost him his job.Bevins, 39, is well known for his maths ability. Before joining darts full-time, he appeared on the BBC show Countdown in 2009. He won all eight of his heats with a record 925 points and then claimed the overall title. He is also the only contestant to achieve a perfect 15-round game on the show.He began working in darts as a voluntary scorer in 2010 and became a full PDC referee in 2013.Meanwhile, Bunting went on to beat Gian van Veen 6-2 in the final. Speaking after his win, Bunting said he had felt doubted before the tournament, with many people claiming he did not deserve his place. He added that he believes in his hard work and said these big nights are what he lives for, praising the crowd for helping him perform at his best.",Luke humphries lost 6-4 to stephen bunting in premier league darts quarter-final.

AHMEDABAD: South Africa have emerged as a strong contender for the World Cup title, but Aiden Markram feels the campaign has been a tiring one. “New Zealand, India and West Indies are quality team and to put in strong performances against sides like that gives you confidence,” Markram said.“But it honestly doesn’t feel easy. Every game drains you. The intensity is seriously high and you know things can change very quickly in T20 cricket.

So if you want to challenge the opposition, then you’ve got to find runs, especially on a surface like that which is so good. You still have to measure the risks in some way. If we just bat deep and only get 150-160 on a surface like that, it is always going to be tough work,” Hope said.",South africa have emerged as a strong contender for the world cup title.

Austin Reaves breaks silence with pointed three-word fix for Los Angeles Lakers slump

The Los Angeles Lakers have been making noise during the ongoing NBA season for all the wrong reasons. After a frustrating loss against the Phoenix Suns in a recent game, the Lakers are unfortunately unable to break their losing streak. Apart from witnessing one of the longest slumps in the 2025-26 NBA season, Los Angeles Lakers’ talented guard Austin Reaves shared a blunt message reflecting on the current condition of the popular NBA team.According to Austin Reaves, not everything has fallen apart for the Lakers, as the 27-year-old believes a lot can be done to improve the current situation of the team. He went on to drop a straightforward 3-word message to help the Lakers come out of the current situation.The Los Angeles Lakers are currently in one of the darkest phases during the ongoing NBA season. After losing three games back to back, the Lakers have diverted the attention of the world. After a frustrating 113-110 loss against the Phoenix Suns recently, the cracks in the team roster have become a talking point currently. However, amidst all this, Lakers’ guard Austin Reaves can still see the silver lining in the dark clouds.The dynamic NBA star recently dropped a blunt 3-word message for the Los Angeles Lakers. According to him, the team should focus on redirecting their focus on the positives instead of focusing on the negatives. During a recent postgame press conference, Austin Reaves said,“Control the controllables. There’s a handful of plays tonight. I feel like if we are better, it can swing a game. Every possession matters. I know it sounds like a cliché because there are so many of them, but it can swing the game in either direction.”He further continued,“Throughout the game, one little play, one little mistake can ignite a crowd, ignite a team, whatever it may be. So, control those controllables.”Austin Reaves’ message clearly emphasizes the current loss of the Lakers, which is related to the team’s issues with executing proper plans on the floor. Apart from the poor performance of the Lakers, Luka Doncic has become a hotbed of discussion in the NBA world due to his inconsistent performance and a whining attitude towards the referees.","The los angeles lakers are currently in one of the darkest phases during the ongoing nba season.
