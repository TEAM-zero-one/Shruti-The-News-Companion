Connor McDavid stays composed amid speculation

As the Edmonton Oilers prepare for the 2025-26 NHL season, all eyes are on their captain, Connor McDavid, who is entering the final year of his eight-year, $100 million contract. Despite his incredible impact on the franchise, McDavid’s future in Edmonton remains uncertain and according to NHL insider Darren Dreger, that uncertainty is starting to make the organization nervous.During a recent segment, Dreger revealed that Oilers owner Daryl Katz is becoming “a little antsy” as Connor McDavid continues to deliberate on his next move. While Darren Dreger clarified that there’s “no animosity” between McDavid and the front office, he admitted there’s growing unease within the organization about the lack of progress..“There's no animosity here,” Dreger explained. “Is there nervousness building? Sure, you know, I mean, Daryl Katz is probably getting a little antsy, the owner of the Edmonton Oilers. And then that message would be delivered to Jeff Jackson and on to Stan Bowman, the general manager.”Dreger noted that Edmonton is “ready to close whenever Connor is ready,” but the timeline remains entirely in Connor McDavid’s hands. He estimated the chances of an extension happening soon at “50-50” and suggested that any potential deal could be short-term, possibly just two years, a prospect that could unsettle both management and fans.While some worry about the distractions, NHL analyst Eddie Olczyk believes McDavid won’t let the situation affect his performance. “Well, I don't think it's going to hang over Connor McDavid because, just, he breathes different air,” Olczyk said. “I don't think it's going to affect him one bit.”Also Read: Edmonton Oilers reportedly exploring shocking reunion with 40-year-old Marc-Andre Fleury Since his debut in 2015, McDavid has consistently proven to be a generational player, leading Edmonton to consecutive Stanley Cup Final appearances and surpassing the 100-point mark eight times.

Turning Point USA promises a “patriotic alternative” to Bad Bunny’s halftime show

Bad Bunny fires back at critics and doubles down on representation

The NFL ’s decision to name Bad Bunny as the headliner for the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show has sparked one of the most polarizing cultural debates in recent memory. While millions of fans worldwide celebrated the Puerto Rican megastar’s appointment, conservative circles — led by Turning Point USA, the late Charlie Kirk’s right-wing political organization — are striking back with their own plan: a rival event called The All American Halftime Show.On Thursday, Turning Point USA’s official X (formerly Twitter) account confirmed the initiative, writing, “It’s true, Turning Point USA is thrilled to announce The All American Halftime Show. Performers and event details coming soon.”The announcement follows a week of escalating backlash from conservative commentators who claim Bad Bunny’s selection represents a cultural shift that sidelines traditional American performers. Critics have also resurfaced the artist’s past remarks about U.S. immigration enforcement and his outspoken criticism of former president Donald Trump .For Turning Point, the timing is deliberate. The group, known for its fusion of pop culture and politics, is positioning the rival concert as a “celebration of American values,” a move that could appeal to disenchanted NFL fans who see the league’s halftime programming as increasingly political.Meanwhile, Bad Bunny has shown no signs of backing down. Hosting Saturday Night Live, the global superstar addressed the controversy with confidence and pride.“I’m very excited to be doing the Super Bowl, and I know people all around the world who love my music are also happy,” he said.Switching to Spanish, he added, “Especially all of the Latinos and Latinas in the world here in the United States who have worked to open doors. It’s more than a win for myself, it’s a win for all of us. Our footprints and our contribution in this country, no one will ever be able to take that away or erase it.”And in a final jab aimed at his detractors, he quipped, “If you didn’t understand what I just said, you have four months to learn.”Also Read: Is Jalen Carter playing against the Giants?

Bad Bunny’s global influence outweighs critics’ complaints

When the NFL confirmed that Bad Bunny would headline the 2026 Super Bowl halftime show, the news sent waves through both the music and sports worlds. The Puerto Rican megastar’s selection marked a historic shift, he would be the first artist to perform the show primarily in Spanish, signaling a bold embrace of Latin culture on America’s biggest stage. But as the applause rolled in, so did the criticism.Model and media personality Kayla Nicole, who once dated Kansas City Chiefs tight end Travis Kelce , addressed the uproar on her podcast Pre-Game, sharing a sharp take on what the public reaction revealed. “I think that the discourse, too, around this whole Benito halftime show, I’m just thankful for moments like this,” she said.She added, “Because every time it happens, anything that has like any level of cultural significance, I know exactly who I need to unfollow and delete out of my f*****g life, because the racist people will tell on themselves every single time.”Her remarks struck a chord online, as social media debates over Bad Bunny’s performance quickly turned into conversations about language, culture, and inclusivity. Some fans questioned whether a Spanish-language show belonged in the Super Bowl, claiming they wouldn’t understand the lyrics.Nicole brushed off those complaints, pointing out the hypocrisy behind them. “The amount of people complaining because they’re not going to be able to understand the words because they don’t know Spanish,” she said.“I’ve listened to so much, so many genres where I don’t know what they’re talking about, but I still love a beat.”At just 31, Bad Bunny has become a cultural force unlike any other. With three Grammy wins, 10 nominations, and billions of streams, he’s helped redefine what global stardom looks like. His selection for the Super Bowl isn’t just about entertainment, it’s a statement about where American pop culture is headed.Also Read: Speaker Mike Johnson accuses NFL of turning ‘anti-American’ after picking Bad Bunny for Super Bowl halftime show While critics question whether a Spanish-led performance fits the Super Bowl’s mainstream tradition, Nicole and many fans see it differently.

And as Nicole made clear, the outrage says far more about those clinging to old biases than about Bad Bunny himself.","Model and media personality kayla nicole addressed the uproar over bad bunny’s super bowl halftime show on her podcast pre-game.

How Jalen Carter’s injury impacts the Eagles’ defense



The Philadelphia Eagles will be missing one of their biggest defensive weapons in Thursday night’s NFC East showdown against the New York Giants. Star defensive tackle Jalen Carter has been ruled inactive due to a heel injury, marking another setback for the reigning Super Bowl champions as they continue to battle early-season adversity.No, Jalen Carter will not suit up against the Giants. The Second-Team All-Pro appeared on the Eagles’ injury report Wednesday after limited practice participation with a heel issue. Despite traveling with the team and joining pregame warmups briefly, Carter was declared inactive just hours before kickoff.NFL Network’s Mike Garafolo confirmed the update, noting that Carter “was on the field only briefly, signing autographs and speaking with agent Drew Rosenhaus before leaving the field.” The absence is significant, as this marks the second game this season that Carter will miss.Philadelphia’s defensive line will have to adjust quickly. The Eagles elevated defensive tackle Gabe Hall from the practice squad earlier Thursday, joining Jordan Davis, Moro Ojomo, Byron Young, and Ty Robinson to anchor the middle of the defense. The reshuffled group faces added pressure to fill the massive void left by Carter, who has been a disruptive force when healthy.Carter’s absence couldn’t have come at a worse time. The Eagles’ defense, built around its fierce pass rush, relies heavily on Carter’s ability to collapse pockets and disrupt plays from the interior. Without him, defensive coordinator Vic Fangio may need to tweak his approach, leaning more on Jordan Davis and Byron Young to contain the Giants’ offensive line.Philadelphia’s injury list doesn’t end there. Pro Bowl left guard Landon Dickerson (ankle) and tight end Grant Calcaterra (oblique) have both been ruled out for Week 6, further testing the team’s depth. However, there’s some relief with linebacker Nakobe Dean’s return from a knee injury, offering a spark to the defense in Carter’s absence.Carter’s heel injury adds to a turbulent season already marked by highs and lows, including his early-season ejection for spitting on Cowboys quarterback Dak Prescott. The Eagles now face the challenge of keeping momentum alive without their defensive anchor as they aim for another deep playoff run.Also Read: Saquon Barkley’s fiancée Anna gets emotional watching his heartwarming pregame moment with daughter before facing former team",Jalen carter has been ruled inactive for thursday night's game against the new york giants.

Russell Wilson opens up to Ciara in personal message



Russell Wilson’s challenging season with the Giants



The New York Giants started Thursday Night Football by playing Jaxson Dart over veteran quarterback Russell Wilson for the Week 6 clash against the Philadelphia Eagles. This marks Wilson’s third consecutive game on the bench after a series of underwhelming performances earlier in the season. While the benching has sparked debate, it is purely a football decision and not injury-related, signaling a shift in the Giants’ strategy.While football is a huge part of Russell Wilson’s life, his family provides him with balance during challenging times. On October 1, he shared a heartfelt Instagram post featuring his wife, Ciara, and their four children. “Thank You God for blessing me with my family,” Wilson wrote. “Moments we cherish for LIFE!!! ❤️🙏🏾 @ciara.”Wilson and Ciara have been active in philanthropy, donating millions of meals during the pandemic, supporting Colorado communities, and even authoring a children’s book to inspire kids to chase their dreams. Their family focus appears to give Wilson strength amid professional setbacks, demonstrating that his legacy extends beyond the field.As the Giants face the defending Super Bowl champions, the Philadelphia Eagles, Wilson remains poised to contribute if called upon.While Dart leads the offense, Wilson’s presence is a reminder that experience and resilience are never far from the game.Super Bowl champion Russell Wilson, 36, entered the 2025 season with high expectations after signing a $10.5 million contract with the Giants. He was named the starter over Jameis Winston and rookie Jaxson Dart, but early struggles have left fans and management questioning his form. A Week 3 loss to the Kansas City Chiefs, where Wilson threw two interceptions and was booed by the home crowd, accelerated the decision to hand the reins to Dart. Fans even chanted, “we want Dart,” highlighting the growing demand for a change at quarterback.The move paid off initially, as Dart led the Giants to their first win of the season against the Chargers in Week 4. Although the team fell to the Saints 26-14 in Week 5, the Giants opted to stick with Dart, showing confidence in the rookie’s potential against a tough Philadelphia squad. Despite being sidelined, Wilson remains ready to step in at any moment, underscoring his professionalism and team-first attitude.Also Read: Who is Jaxson Dart’s mom Kara?

Who Is Jaxson Dart’s Mom Kara Dart?



Kara Dart’s Role Beyond the Field



Jaxson Dart made an unforgettable debut for the New York Giants, leading the team to snap their 0-3 losing streak and ending the Los Angeles Chargers’ undefeated run. But as cameras captured the rookie quarterback’s triumph, one face stood out—his mother, Kara Dart. Her emotional reactions went viral, and the tender post-game hug between mother and son left fans wanting to know more about the woman behind the rising NFL star.Kara Dart was born and raised in Utah and has always been a standout athlete. A two-time all-state basketball player at Weber High School in Pleasant View, she also excelled in track and volleyball. Her dedication to fitness continues today, as she shares workout routines and active lifestyle glimpses on Instagram and even competes in marathons. Kara’s athletic background, combined with her husband Brandon’s college football experience at the University of Utah, created a home filled with sports, guidance, and discipline that shaped Jaxson’s path to the NFL.Beyond her athletic influence, Kara is a guiding force in Jaxson’s personal and professional life. Brandon recalls a defining moment at home: “I just remember walking in the house and [Brandon] at the kitchen table and she’s kind of giving it to him, like, ‘Jax, you had a chance at that point in time to blow that dude up. We don’t take the easy way out.’ And he’s kind of sitting there like, ‘Okay mom, okay, okay.’ ”Jaxson has also shared how Kara’s pregame pep talks keep him grounded.In August 2024, he told GQ, “When I’m walking through the Walk of Champions, I’ll go see her, give her a hug, and she’ll try to hype me up. But after every little interaction, she always reminds me to slide. That’s her go-to every single time. If she thinks I didn’t hear it when I walk away, she’ll make sure to scream it even louder.”Kara’s influence isn’t limited to sports. She’s also guided Jaxson in personal style and fashion. “My mom’s into it, and she’s done a great job of letting me choose and find things that I like and just giving me options,” Dart told GQ. “At the same time, it’s just something that I’ve come to really love and to express myself in different ways…I’ve relied on her for a lot of things in the fashion world.”While the Giants face challenges on the field, including injuries and tough matchups, Jaxson’s rise brings hope to New York. And no matter the outcome, Kara Dart remains the quarterback’s biggest fan, offering unwavering support and shaping not just his game but his character.Also Read: Giants fan favorite Cam Skattebo’s girlfriend Chloe stuns in dazzling outfit against NFC East rivals Eagles","Kara dart was born and raised in utah and has always been a standout athlete.

Lamar Jackson’s Hamstring injury raises questions about Ravens ’ 2025 Season



Ravens navigate early-season struggles as Lamar Jackson’s recovery timeline remains uncertain

The Baltimore Ravens have had a rough start to the 2025 NFL season, struggling to maintain momentum amid key injuries. The latest blow came in Week 4 when star quarterback Lamar Jackson exited the game against the Kansas City Chiefs with a hamstring injury. With Baltimore sitting at 1-3, the team faces mounting pressure to navigate the season without its franchise quarterback.Lamar Jackson suffered a hamstring injury during the third quarter of Baltimore’s clash with the Chiefs, leaving fans and analysts concerned about his availability in upcoming games. The injury occurred on the final play of the Ravens’ offensive drive, and Jackson did not return when the offense regained possession. While initially listed as questionable, he remained sidelined, signaling that the injury could be more serious than first anticipated.Reports from the Baltimore Sun suggest Jackson could be out for 2-3 weeks, although Ian Rapoport described the situation as “week to week,” highlighting the uncertainty surrounding his recovery. Jackson missed Week 5’s matchup against the Houston Texans and, as of October 9, has not yet resumed practice.According to ESPN’s Adam Schefter, “No practice today for either Ravens QB Lamar Jackson (hamstring) or Cardinals QB Kyler Murray (foot).” The Ravens now prepare to face the Los Angeles Rams on Sunday, October 12, without their star quarterback.Head coach Jim Harbaugh confirmed that Jackson would not have been able to return to the game even if it had been closer, emphasizing the severity of the injury. Sources reported by Josina Anderson indicate that Jackson may not return until after Baltimore’s Week 7 bye week, which could provide a small silver lining for the team as it gives him additional recovery time.The timing of Jackson’s injury comes at a challenging period for the Ravens, with multiple defensive injuries compounding the team’s struggles. Losing a key player like Jackson not only affects offensive efficiency but also puts added pressure on Baltimore’s backup quarterbacks to step up. How the Ravens adjust in the coming weeks could determine whether they recover from this early-season slump or continue to fall behind in the competitive AFC North.The bye week provides a potential window for Lamar Jackson’s return, giving Baltimore time to regroup. The team’s resilience and ability to adapt will be critical as the Ravens aim to salvage their 2025 season.Also Read: Why Fox pulled Mark Sanchez — Here’s who steps into the booth for Sunday’s Seahawks vs. Jaguars clash","Lamar jackson suffered a hamstring injury during the third quarter of baltimore’s clash with the chiefs, leaving fans and analysts concerned about his availability in upcoming games.

Women's World Cup prediction: Greenstone Lobo explains which team has best chance to win

Poll What does India's loss mean for their World Cup campaign? A wake-up call for the team No big impact, they will bounce back It shows they have weaknesses to address

NEW DELHI: India captain Harmanpreet Kaur minced no words after her team's shocking three-wicket loss to South Africa in the ICC Women's World Cup on Thursday, admitting that her top order failed to take responsibility when it mattered most.“We didn't take the responsibility as a top order,” Harmanpreet said bluntly after the match. “We have to change things. We have to get good totals. It is a long tournament, and there are lots of learnings. We need to keep ourselves in a positive frame of mind.”India, reeling at 102 for six, were rescued by Richa Ghosh's breathtaking 94 off 77 balls, studded with 11 fours and five sixes, lifting the side to 251. However, South Africa's Nadine de Klerk (84 not out off 54) and skipper Laura Wolvaardt (70) guided their team to a memorable victory, handing India their first defeat of the campaign.“It was a tough game,” Harmanpreet reflected. “Both teams played really well. Even though we collapsed while batting, we still managed to put 250 on the board. In the end, Chloe (Tryon) and de Klerk batted beautifully. They showed it was a very good pitch and they deserved to win.”The Indian skipper, however, was all praise for her wicketkeeper-batter, whose heroics went in vain. “Richa has been outstanding for us. Today we were very pleased to see her hitting.She can get the big totals — hope she continues.”For South Africa, de Klerk was understandably ecstatic after being named Player of the Match. “I'm lost for words,” she said. “No bigger stage than playing India at home. We had to take it deep, and Chloe took the pressure off me. We're capable of beating the best sides.”Wolvaardt echoed her teammate's sentiments, hailing de Klerk's fearless hitting. “I don't think I've seen something like that in my career. It was a special innings,” she said. “She's been hitting like that in the nets, and I'm glad it came off today.”","India captain harmanpreet kaur says her top order failed to take responsibility.
