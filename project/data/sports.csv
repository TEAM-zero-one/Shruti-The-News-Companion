Derrick Henry Ready to win in Baltimore w/ Lamar, NFL legacy, Alabama’s best & RB future |The Pivot

I knew once free agency started that I wanted to work something out [with the Ravens] if we could,

Even though I’m living in Dallas and Dallas being a perfect situation, as well, because we lived there, we ain’t got to move…”

“They ain’t holla at me at all,”

Dallas could have been a perfect fit, but now Henry is locked in with the Ravens

Baltimore Ravens ’ star running back Derrick Henry has officially sold his Dallas home, but it’s not just a routine real estate transaction—it’s a symbolic farewell to a long-standing dream. Henry, who was once rumored to be eyeing a future with the Dallas Cowboys , sold the property for $1.6 million, falling short of its original asking price. This move marks the final chapter in his connection to Dallas, a city he once hoped to call his permanent NFL home.Henry originally bought the luxurious 4,154-square-foot home in Inwood Park in 2022. Featuring 20-foot ceilings, floor-to-ceiling windows, marble floors, and hardwood flooring, the property was a high-end investment. The stunning residence offers four bedrooms, four bathrooms, and a spacious three-car garage. Designed for both comfort and style, it boasts a gourmet kitchen, a cozy fireplace, custom walk-in closets, and a lush turf backyard perfect for outdoor relaxation.He first listed it for $1.8 million in 2023 but later took it off the market before relisting it at $1.6 million with a different real estate agency.According to TMZ, the final sale amount has not been disclosed, but sources suggest it was close to the lowered asking price. The sale ends Henry’s residential ties to Dallas, a city he had considered home due to his girlfriend, Adrianna Rivas , having family in the area.While Henry’s Dallas residency was partly personal, it was also fueled by his football aspirations. The running back admitted onpodcast that he had wanted to play for the Cowboys.” Henry said. “Unfortunately for Henry, the Cowboys never approached him.he revealed, making it clear that the interest was one-sided.Many Cowboys fans were thrilled by the idea of Derrick Henry joining the team and teaming up with Dak Prescott. With his powerful running style and Dallas’ solid offensive line, Henry could have brought a whole new level of strength to the offense. His ability to break tackles and wear down defenses seemed like the perfect fit for a team looking to boost its rushing attack. But despite all the excitement and speculation, the Cowboys stuck to their usual cautious approach to building the roster. Instead of making a big move for Henry, they decided to stay the course—meaning the star running back never got the call.Now, he’s set to be a major difference-maker for the Ravens, strengthening their already powerful running game alongside his new teammates. With his size, speed, and experience, he adds another level of dominance to Baltimore’s offense, making them an even bigger threat. Meanwhile, Cowboys fans may be left wondering what could have been, regretting the missed chance to have him in their backfield. But for Ravens fans, this move is cause for celebration. Henry isn’t just switching teams—he’s fully embracing Baltimore’s Super Bowl dreams, bringing his unstoppable energy and determination to help them compete at the highest level.Also read - Cam Heyward says he ""Stole"" DK Metcalf from the Chargers, did he cross the line?","Derrick henry sold his dallas home for $1.6 million, falling short of its original asking price.

NEW DELHI: A high-voltage Indian Premier League (IPL) clash between Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) and Chennai Super Kings ( CSK ) saw tempers flare, with Virat Kohli and Khaleel Ahmed at the center of an intense face-off.The heated moment came after RCB broke their 17-year jinx at Chepauk with a commanding 50-run victory over CSK.The spark was ignited during RCB’s innings when Khaleel Ahmed bowled a sharp bouncer to Kohli, who missed the delivery.The CSK pacer followed through aggressively, getting uncomfortably close and giving a fierce stare at Kohli. The RCB batter did not take kindly to it.However, the real drama unfolded after the match during the customary handshake.Kohli, who scored 31 off 30 balls, was visibly agitated when Khaleel approached him -- possibly to extend a peace offering.While shaking his hand, Kohli shoved the pacer away, making his frustration evident.Watch:Standing nearby, MS Dhoni watched the incident unfold with his signature calm demeanor, but the exchange was already caught on camera, sparking discussions among fans.Later, Kohli was seen having a light-hearted chat with Ravindra Jadeja before his demeanour suddenly changed upon noticing Khaleel Ahmed approaching him.His aggressive reaction was caught on camera, showcasing an intense exchange. However, the heated moment eventually cooled down, ending with both players shaking hands in a show of sportsmanship.Earlier in the game, RCB posted a solid 196/7, thanks to a gritty 51 off 32 by Rajat Patidar and a late cameo from Tim David (22 not out off 8).Despite a brisk start by Phil Salt (32 off 16) and Devdutt Padikkal (27 off 14), the innings stumbled in the middle overs before Patidar and David provided the finishing touches.CSK’s chase faltered early as Josh Hazlewood (3/21) and Yash Dayal (2/18) rattled their top order, leaving them at 52/4.Rachin Ravindra (41 off 31) and MS Dhoni (30 not out off 16) fought back, but it wasn’t enough as CSK fell short, finishing at 146/8.While RCB celebrated a historic win, Kohli’s fiery moment ensured that the drama didn’t end with the match.READ ALSO: MS Dhoni becomes CSK’s highest run-scorer in IPL history",Royal challengers bengaluru (rcb) beat chennai super kings (csk) by 50 runs.

IPL | Punjab Kings' Suryansh Shedge: From playing under Shreyas to dreaming of meeting Kohli

Left-arm pacer Mitchell Starc delivered a sensational spell of 5-35, while vice-captain Faf du Plessis smashed a rapid 27-ball half-century as Delhi Capitals registered a commanding seven-wicket victory over Sunrisers Hyderabad at the Dr. Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy ACA-VDCA Cricket Stadium in Visakhapatnam. The win keeps DC unbeaten in IPL 2025 .On a surface offering some grip, Starc’s three wickets in the powerplay pushed SRH on the back foot early. He later returned to clean up the tail, claiming his first five-wicket haul in T20 cricket. His variation in pace proved to be a key factor in dismantling SRH’s batting lineup. Kuldeep Yadav (3-22) and Mohit Sharma (1-25) provided solid support, ensuring DC’s dominance.Also See: RR vs CSK Live Score For SRH, uncapped batter Aniket Verma was the lone bright spot, producing a stunning 74 off 41 balls. He forged a crucial 77-run partnership off just 40 balls with Heinrich Klaasen (32), but the rest of the batting order failed to capitalize, once again struggling to put up a competitive total.In response, du Plessis showcased his class with a fluent fifty, laced with three fours and three sixes at a strike rate of 185.19. He was well-assisted by Jake Fraser-McGurk (38), KL Rahul (15), Abishek Porel (34*), and Tristan Stubbs (21*), as DC chased the target with ease, wrapping up the match with four overs to spare. For SRH, debutant leg-spinner Zeeshan Ansari impressed with figures of 3-42.Opting to bat first, SRH got off to a shaky start despite Travis Head finding the boundary twice off Starc in the opening over. A mix-up saw Abhishek Sharma run out for just one, and from there, the collapse began. Starc dismissed Ishan Kishan (caught at deep third man), local lad Nitish Kumar Reddy (caught at mid-on off an off-cutter), and Head (caught behind attempting a steer to third man), reducing SRH to a precarious position.Verma got a reprieve when he was dropped on six off Axar Patel’s bowling, and Klaasen injected some momentum with aggressive strokeplay, smashing Starc and Axar for boundaries to end the powerplay on a high.Verma continued his counterattack, slog-sweeping Vipraj Nigam for six and hammering Axar for consecutive maximums—one over deep square leg and another straight down the ground. He maintained a strong base, lofting Mohit Sharma for four and dispatching Kuldeep for a towering six.However, the promising 77-run stand was broken in the 11th over when Klaasen’s attempted leg-side shot off Mohit was brilliantly caught by Nigam, who sprinted back from backward point. SRH then lost Abhinav Manohar and Pat Cummins cheaply to Kuldeep. Verma, though, fought on, reaching his maiden IPL fifty off 34 balls and continuing to clear the ropes with ease.His onslaught included more powerful shots—an inside-out drive off Axar for four, followed by two more sixes off the left-arm spinner. However, Kuldeep had the final say, as Fraser-McGurk executed a perfectly timed jump at deep mid-wicket to send Verma back for a well-made 74. Starc then returned to polish off the tail, ensuring SRH didn’t even bat their full 20 overs.Fraser-McGurk set the tone early, slog-sweeping Abhishek Sharma for six, while du Plessis pulled Mohammed Shami for a maximum. While Fraser-McGurk struggled with timing and survived two dropped catches, du Plessis was in supreme touch, finding boundaries off Shami, Abhishek, and Cummins—his straight six off the Australian pacer standing out.Fraser-McGurk continued his aggression with an uppish drive off Ansari for four before du Plessis reached his fifty off just 26 balls. However, the leg-spinner had his moment in the next over, as du Plessis mistimed a slog to long-on, giving Ansari his first IPL wicket.Taking over the attack, Fraser-McGurk smashed Ansari for two fours and a six before chipping one back to the bowler for 38. KL Rahul announced himself in DC colors with a streaky boundary off his first ball, followed by a majestic slog-sweep and a lofted drive off Shami for six and four. But his promising start was cut short when he was bowled around his legs attempting a sweep off Ansari for 15.Porel ensured there were no hiccups, whipping Abhishek for four and later smashing Ansari for a six and four in successive deliveries. Stubbs, too, joined the party, lofting Harshal Patel for a boundary before pulling and driving Wiaan Mulder for two more fours. Fittingly, Porel sealed the win in style, clubbing Mulder for a six as DC wrapped up their Visakhapatnam home leg with an emphatic victory.","Delhi capitals beat sunrisers hyderabad by seven wickets in ipl 2025.

NEW DELHI: Former Indian cricketer Sanjay Manjrekar has expressed concerns over Rohit Sharma 's current performance, underlining a noticeable decline in the form of the experienced batsman. The former MI skipper has amassed six single-digit scores in his last nine IPL innings, including .According to Manjrekar, Sharma, a pivotal figure for the Mumbai Indians , appears to be at a critical juncture in his career where additional effort is required to maintain his level of play.""Rohit Sharma is clearly going through a phase. He's not the Rohit Sharma of, say, three to four years ago. He's at a stage in his career where he has to push himself every morning - train hard and be at his best - because things are slipping away for him. He's still relying on his natural talent and instincts,"" Manjrekar told JioStar.Also See: DC vs SRH IPL Live Score Mumbai Indians faced a 36-run defeat to the Gujarat Titans , indicating potential areas for improvement in their batting lineup.In his analysis of the Mumbai Indians' batting efforts in recent matches, Manjrekar noted the adaptation challenges faced by Ryan Rickelton, a South African player, to Indian pitches.""Ryan Rickelton, being a South African, will take time to adjust to Indian pitches. Very few South African batters, barring AB de Villiers and Heinrich Klaasen, have truly flourished on Indian pitches. So, we'll have to give him time. Apart from that, Tilak Varma and Suryakumar Yadav, along with Robin Minz and some of the other players, form the batting line-up. However, to me, it still looks a little unconvincing. And a lot of them rely on pitches where the ball comes onto the bat nicely,"" said Manjrekar.""There's pace and bounce, and even in that chase where they needed 12 or 13 runs, if it had been at Wankhede Stadium, they would have likely come very close to the target.""Despite these challenges, Manjrekar remains hopeful for the Mumbai Indians' prospects in the tournament. He acknowledged the team's struggle in their recent match against the Gujarat Titans, where they were unable to chase a target of 197, finishing at 160 for six.The comparison of the early wicket losses between the two teams and the difficulties in building partnerships during a high-scoring chase were highlighted as key factors in the match's outcome.""The dew never came in, which made Mumbai's job even more difficult. But despite all that, two losses are quite typical for Mumbai Indians. They still seem to be on the right track to go on and win the title,"" Manjrekar added.","Former indian cricketer sanjay manjrekar has expressed concerns over rohit sharma's current performance.

CSK in IPL 2025: Sixth title loading for Chennai Super Kings?

Chennai: There’s a new ‘No. 9’ in town. MS Dhoni has made a career out of being out of the box, but on Friday night at the MA Chidambaram Stadium, he seemed to be stretching things a bit too far.As wickets fell and CSK kept losing steam in their chase of 197, the fans got more and more impatient. They wanted to see their ‘Thala’ come out and take on the RCB bowlers, but the wait continued. It was only after Ravichandran Ashwin, not exactly a swashbuckler, got out in the 16th over that Dhoni walked in at No. 9, probably the lowest that he has batted in his 18-year IPL career.Not that he batted badly. The 16-ball 30* was an indicator that his ability to clear the boundary hasn’t exactly diminished. In fact, it was his late burst of 19 off Krunal Pandya that brought down the margin of defeat to 50. But then, what’s holding him back? Dhoni is apparently “fitter than what he was in the last two years,” when he was playing with a knee injury and a muscle tear, respectively. His wicketkeeping skills are only getting better — the stumping of Phil Salt on Friday was a piece of beauty — but there’s a strange reluctance to go up the order with the bat.Virender Sehwag was quite critical about his decision to bat No. 9. “What can you do? Even when he was playing for India, he didn’t care much for suggestions to go up the order. Now, it’s probably the fag end of his career, what can you expect?” Sehwag said in a post-match show.The CSK think-tank, though, has a different take on the issue. Captain Ruturaj Gaikwad was asked before the first game against Mumbai Indians if there will be a case for a promotion in the batting order for Dhoni. “MSD has been performing a specific role and he is doing that very well. It’s unlikely to change,” he said.What he meant was that Dhoni is still immensely dangerous at the business end of the innings, where his ability to clear the fence and the fear factor that he generates combine beautifully to bolster the CSK totals. Last year, in those short bursts, Dhoni was batting at a strike-rate of 220.54, and the CSK team wants that same impact this time too.Even though the legend has maintained his body well, there’s always that gnawing suspicion that too much running between the wickets may just lead to damage of the ageing body that has taken a lot of wear and tear. The IPL is a two-month journey, and the team wants him fully fit when things really get tight at the back-end.Don’t be surprised if CSK are only three down in the 15th over against Rajasthan Royals in Guwahati on Sunday and Dhoni comes out to bat. “Dhoni has done a good pre-season, working on his hitting and keeping skills,” coach Stephen Fleming said.","Ms dhoni has made a career out of being out of the box, but on friday night at the ma chidambaram stadium, he seemed to be stretching things a bit too far.

NEW DELHI: Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) secured a convincing 50-run win over Chennai Super Kings ( CSK ) in the eighth match of the 2025 Indian Premier League , thanks to stellar performances from Rajat Patidar and Josh Hazlewood CSK, chasing a target of 197, faltered in their pursuit, finishing with just 146/8 in their 20 overs.RCB, after being put in to bat by CSK, posted a formidable total of 196/7.The innings was built around Patidar's crucial knock of 51 runs off 32 balls, a composed effort that anchored the middle order after early wickets fell.Patidar's knock, which included four boundaries and three sixes, came at a brisk strike rate of 159.38.His efforts were complemented by Tim David’s unbeaten 22 off 8 balls, which ensured that RCB maintained momentum despite losing wickets at regular intervals.The standout bowling performance for RCB came from Josh Hazlewood, who wreaked havoc with the new ball, claiming two wicketsin the first over. He later got another one, picking up a figure of 3/21 runs in his 4 overs.Hazlewood was instrumental in breaking CSK's chase early, dismissing Rahul Tripathi, Ruturaj Gaikwad, and Ravindra Jadeja, all key CSK batters.His disciplined bowling ensured that CSK never really got into the chase, despite a spirited late attempt from MS Dhoni , who remained unbeaten on 30 off 16 balls.CSK’s chase never gained momentum as they lost wickets at crucial intervals.Hazlewood's early breakthroughs set the tone. Livingstone's wicket of Ravichandran Ashwin was a key turning point.Despite Dhoni’s late resistance, hitting two sixes and three fours in his innings, CSK’s total of 146/8 was insufficient.Hazlewood’s dominance with the ball, paired with Patidar’s vital contribution with the bat, led RCB to a comfortable 50-run victory, leaving CSK to reflect on a disappointing outing at Chepauk.RCB next face Gujarat Titans next Wednesday, while CSK travel to Guwahati for their next match against Rajasthan Royals on Sunday.","Royal challengers bengaluru (rcb) secured a convincing 50-run win over chennai super kings ( csk ) in the eighth match of the indian premier league.

At 19, he became the second-youngest champion in the tournament’s history, following Carlos Alcaraz, who won as an 18-year-old in 2022.The match was delayed for nearly six hours due to rain in Florida, leaving Mensik with plenty of time to process the challenge ahead — preventing Djokovic from clinching his 100th career title.Born in September 2005, when Djokovic had already broken into the ATP top-100, Mensik refused to be overwhelmed by the occasion. Instead, he delivered a near-flawless performance, using his powerful serve and aggressive baseline game to become the first Czech player since Tomas Berdych in 2005 to win an ATP Masters 1000 event.Djokovic, appearing troubled by an issue under his right eye, frequently applied eye drops and consulted his team.Still, Mensik capitalised, racing to a 3-0 lead in the first set before Djokovic clawed back. In the tie-break, Mensik dominated, building a 5-0 advantage before closing it out with an overhead smash.The second set saw Djokovic applying pressure from the baseline, but Mensik remained composed, dropping just one break point in the match. With 77% of first-serve points won, the Czech teen sealed a statement victory, toppling a legend and etching his name in Miami Open history.","Jakub mensik beat novak djokovic in straight sets 7-6 (7/4), 7-5.

Los Angeles Lakers’ big three respond to J.J. Redick’s challenge with a statement win



The Los Angeles Lakers let a sure win slip through their fingers on Thursday night, March 27, in one of the most frustrating losses of their season. Facing a Chicago Bulls squad that has struggled all year, the Lakers should have closed things out easily. Instead, they collapsed in the final 30 seconds, with mistakes from their biggest stars opening the door for a stunning Bulls comeback. For a team with championship ambitions, this wasn’t just a bad loss, it was an embarrassing one.After that brutal loss, Lakers head coach JJ Redick didn’t waste a second. With a crucial game against the Memphis Grizzlies coming up, he called an early Saturday morning meeting with LeBron James , Luka Doncic , and Austin Reaves . No sugarcoating, no pep talk—just a direct challenge. They had to be better. They had to lead. J.J. Redick knew his team needed a shift in mentality, and he placed the responsibility on his Big Three. ""We challenged all three of them when we get to their three-man actions to play with a little more force, a little more thrust, and a little more creativity,"" Redick said via ESPN’s Dave McMenamin.The message landed. That night, the Los Angeles Lakers stormed back with a 134-127 win over the Grizzlies, looking like a team that had something to prove. LeBron James Luka Doncic , and Austin Reaves stepped up in a big way, combining for 120 points and showing the kind of chemistry and leadership Redick had demanded. Reaves, in particular, caught fire, leading the charge with 31 points on a sharp 8-of-16 shooting, including 5-of-8 from deep.After the game, Reaves opened up about how the meeting forced them to reset and refocus. ""I think the meeting was just still trying to build that chemistry amongst the three of us to help the team be successful,"" he said. ""Tonight, it just showed that when we play the right way and trust one another, especially offensively, we can have open looks on almost every possession. … It was really just a conversation about how bad all of us want to win and win at a high level.""This win wasn’t just about bouncing back—it had real implications for the Western Conference standings . The Lakers and Grizzlies entered the game tied at 44-29, making it a crucial showdown. By coming out on top, Los Angeles not only improved to 45-29 but also jumped into the fourth seed, boosting their chances of securing home-court advantage in the playoffs.Ja Morant made his return for Memphis after being sidelined since March 14, and while he put up 22 points and 10 assists, he wasn’t quite in rhythm. Shooting just 9-of-23 from the field, he showed some rust, and the Lakers took full advantage, keeping control of the game from start to finish.Also Read: Memphis Grizzlies stun NBA by firing head coach Taylor Jenkins right before playoffs: ""What is going on?!"" With the postseason approaching, Redick’s ability to get his stars locked in at the right time might be exactly what the Lakers need. James and Doncic are asserting their dominance, while Reaves is proving to be a key offensive weapon. The Lakers are gaining momentum at the perfect moment. Their next test comes Monday night against the Houston Rockets, a team sitting ahead of them in the standings. Another statement win could solidify their standing as a real threat in the West.","The los angeles lakers lost to the chicago bulls on thursday night, march 27.

In his return to the Yankee Stadium , against the New York Yankees , Milwaukee Brewers ’ pitcher Nestor Cortes had to fight harder than ever. He had to give up five of the Yankees' record-breaking nine home runs and only lasted a little over two innings in a 20-9 loss. Nestor Cortes reveals what the game felt like for him and what he plans.Regarding the game against the New York Yankees, Nestor Cortes admitted he did not feel good and the game was not like he had planned for it. He said:“It’s not a good feeling, it didn’t go the way I planned.”Even after the game concluded, Cortes chose not to interact with the media. While the Milwaukee Brewers explained that it took place due to a miscommunication.The beginning of the game was a struggling start for Nestor Cortes, when he had to give up home runs on at least three of his pitches to the Yankees’ players — Paul Goldschmidt, Cody Bellinger, and Aaron Judge.Known for his “unique” pitching style, Nestor Cortes joined the Milwaukee Brewers in December. Nestor Cortes said:""Obviously I spent a few years over there, and I was able to be on their side and not have to face them, but I think this comes with the territory of being a major league pitcher, You never know where you're going to end up and at some point, you're going to face somebody you know or somebody that's close to you and it just happened to be yesterday.""Further, Nestor Cortes talked about how the New York Yankees had a plan, that they were able to execute, while he felt he didn’t, and that is his learning experience. He said:Obviously, when you allow eight runs, it’s not a good feeling. Obviously, it didn’t go the way planned. I have to get ready for the next one. The five walks hurt me a lot. I feel like they know the type of pitcher that I am, what I do and [what] my strategy is. It was my fault to not deviate from that. They had a plan, they executed and I didn’t.

IPL | Punjab Kings' Suryansh Shedge: From playing under Shreyas to dreaming of meeting Kohli

Rajasthan Royals' stand-in captain Riyan Parag has been fined Rs 12 lakhs by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for maintaining a slow over-rate during their match against Chennai Super Kings at Barsapara Stadium on Sunday. The fine came after Rajasthan secured their first win of IPL 2025 in three attempts, following losses to Sunrisers Hyderabad and Kolkata Knight Riders.The penalty was imposed under Article 2.22 of the IPL's Code of Conduct, which deals with minimum over-rate offences. As this was the team's first offence of the season, Parag received a monetary penalty.Parag became the second captain this season to face such a fine, following Mumbai Indians' Hardik Pandya, who was penalised similarly after their match against Gujarat Titans in Ahmedabad on Saturday, where MI suffered a 36-run defeat.The BCCI has implemented new regulations for the current season regarding over-rate violations. Captains will no longer face match bans but will receive demerit points based on the severity of the offence. This change follows Hardik's one-match ban in 2024, which caused him to miss Mumbai's season opener against Chennai Super Kings in IPL 2025.In the match against CSK, Rajasthan Royals secured a crucial victory. Sri Lankan spinner Wanindu Hasaranga played a pivotal role, claiming 4 wickets for 35 runs and exposing Chennai's weakness against spin bowling.Nitish Rana's half-century helped Rajasthan post a competitive total. The match went down to the wire, with Sandeep Sharma successfully defending 20 runs in the final over, including the crucial wicket of MS Dhoni.The victory marked Rajasthan's first win of the season after two consecutive losses. They had previously lost their opening match to Sunrisers Hyderabad and their second game to defending champions Kolkata Knight Riders.Rajasthan Royals will look to build on this momentum when they face Punjab Kings in their next match at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh Cricket Stadium in Chandigarh.","Rajasthan royals' stand-in captain riyan parag has been fined rs 12 lakhs by the board of control for cricket in india.

NBA unlocked new milestone after James Harden’s three-pointer during the Los Angeles Clippers vs Cleveland Cavaliers matchup

The NBA’s love affair with the three-point shot reached another historic milestone on Sunday, as James Harden ’s deep-range dagger secured the league’s 30,000th three-pointer of the season. His second-quarter bucket in the Los Angeles Clippers ’ 127-122 loss to the Cleveland Cavaliers created the league’s historic feat this season. The visiting Clippers faced a crushing defeat against the Cavaliers at the Rocket Arena in Cleveland.Three-pointers in NBA games are rapidly increasing, and Harden’s basket from beyond the arc has secured the new milestone for the league. The latest 30,000th threes mark the fourth consecutive season where the NBA has eclipsed the 30,000 mark, which was a figure that was unthinkable before the 2021-22 campaign. What’s more, the league as a whole is on track to obliterate its existing records for total threes made and attempted in a season. The current benchmark of 31,579 threes made was set just last year, while the record for attempts— 86,535— was established in the 2021-22 season.Leading this deep-range revolution are the Boston Celtics, who are closing in on single-season records for three-pointers made and attempted by a team. Boston has already drilled 1,323 long-range shots, just 40 shy of the record set by Golden State two years ago, and with eight games remaining, they are primed to make history. Their 3,574 attempts are also on the verge of surpassing Houston’s 2018-19 record.While the Clippers found themselves on the wrong end of Harden’s milestone propeller moment, the Cleveland Cavaliers celebrated another huge win. On Sunday, the Cavs reached 60 wins in a season for just the third time in franchise history.Donovan Mitchell once again proved why he’s the heartbeat of this Cavaliers squad. He delivered a well-rounded performance with 24 points, 12 rebounds, and seven assists.“He’s at that kind of maturity and mental level where he can manipulate the game how he wants it,” said Cavs head coach Kenny Atkinson. “I would argue that this was probably his best all-around game all year.”Mitchell had plenty of help, as Jarrett Allen (25 points), Evan Mobley (22 points), and Darius Garland (19 points) all contributed to Cleveland’s impressive offensive showing.Also Read: Shaquille O'Neal defends LeBron James' legacy and calls Los Angeles Lakers fans ""greedy""; demands statue for the NBA legend: ""He's a great player with great ability"" “I didn’t expect 60 wins,” Atkinson admitted. “My internal goal was, ‘Can we improve from last year?’ But for this team to take it to another level and kind of shatter that says a lot. And we’re not done—we can still add to that.”The Cavs are now at 60-15, while the Clippers have 42 wins and 32 defeats.","Nba unlocked new milestone after james harden’s three-pointer during the los angeles clippers vs cleveland cavaliers matchup on sunday.
