As the 2026 Indian Premier League (IPL) approaches, Lucknow Super Giants (LSG) enter another defining phase in their brief but eventful journey. Since joining the league in 2022, the franchise has experienced early playoff highs, difficult downturns, and seasons shaped by injuries, form slumps and constant rebuilding.Their campaigns have often revolved around sharp pace bowling, tactical flexibility and a core that mixed promising youth with seasoned performers. But the last season exposed significant gaps, especially in the fast-bowling group, forcing LSG back to the drawing board as they prepare for a crucial reset ahead of IPL 2026.In the previous campaign, Australia's Mitchell Marsh top scored for the the side with 627 runs in 13 matches - the joint-lowest in terms of matches played among the top 10 players with most runs last season. Surprisingly, no other player found room in the top 10, despite an explosive start from Nicholas Pooran, who ended the campaign on 524 in 14 games.Skipper Rishabh Pant , who was also the most expensive, ended the campaign with just 269 runs in 14 matches. He was brought to the side for a mammoth Rs 27 crore.LSG's bowlers were far from their best too, as no bowler found spot among the top 10 wicket takers. In fact, it was Digvesh Rathi who led the pack with 14 wickets from 13 matches. The franchise's focus will be on doing better in this department as they finalize their retentions and releases and head to the auction.","Lsg finished fifth, just one point outside the playoffs spot in the 2025 season after a stop-start campaign.

As the 2026 Indian Premier League approaches, Royal Challengers Bengaluru (RCB) enter the new season with a long history of strong squads, heavy expectations and a fan base that has remained one of the most loyal in the tournament.Their journey across seasons has swung between high-scoring spectacles, deep playoff pushes and repeated attempts to secure the league’s most elusive prize.That pursuit finally ended with their title breakthrough last season. RCB produced one of their most complete campaigns, driven by consistent top-order runs, reliable middle-overs control and a bowling group that delivered in pressure situations.Several players stood out through the year, forming the spine of the championship run and shaping the core the team now carries into 2026.Virat Kohli led the charge with 657 runs, producing eight half-centuries, that too, all in wins, and setting the tone with his aggressive approach in the powerplay. Phil Salt complemented him with rapid starts of his own, striking at 175.98 and consistently breaking open the first six overs.Rajat Patidar’s return as captain added stability, with crucial early-season half-centuries in important away wins that helped steady the side’s route to the final.Their bowling unit matched the batting group’s impact as well. Josh Hazlewood’s 22 wickets, including decisive powerplay bursts and death-overs control, turned tight games in RCB’s favour, while Krunal Pandya’s 17 wickets and late-order utility added balance.Jitesh Sharma and Romario Shepherd provided the finishing punch, delivering high-impact cameos in must-win situations. The abundance of match-winners across departments became the defining trait of RCB's campaign and the backbone of their climb to the title.The win also marked a shift in the side’s approach. After years of depending heavily on individual brilliance, RCB’s 2025 campaign was built on a collective effort, with contributions spread across departments. Their late-season surge, which carried them through the playoffs and into the final, highlighted that shift and has now become the base for their upcoming plans.The focus now shifts to building around the title-winning team. The retained core offers experience and consistency, while younger players who impressed in the previous season add depth.: Rs 16.4 crore: 8 (2 overseas)RCB, the defending champions, will have Rs 16.4 crore going into the auction, but they already have a settled playing eleven and would only look to solidify themselves by adding backups.","After the 2025 ipl triumph, rcb's focus shifted to retaining their crown with crucial retentions and smart releases.

AUCTION BUDGET:





As the 2026 Indian Premier League draws closer, Punjab Kings will look to bounce back from the heartbreak of the previous season and launch a renewed campaign for their maiden IPL trophy. Under the leadership of Shreyas Iyer, PBKS came agonisingly close in IPL 2025, falling just six runs short against Royal Challengers Bengaluru in a thrilling final. Despite the defeat, Punjab’s performance throughout the season reflected significant improvement and marked one of their strongest campaigns in recent years.In IPL 2025, Punjab Kings finished at the top of the points table, showcasing remarkable consistency. They won 10 of their 17 matches, with six losses and one no-result, registering an impressive win percentage of 63.64%. Their journey to the final included a confident victory over Mumbai Indians in Qualifier 2, reinforcing their status as one of the most balanced and competitive sides of the season.The 2025 squad featured a strong mix of experienced international stars and promising young Indian talent. Led by Shreyas Iyer, the squad included dynamic players like Glenn Maxwell, Marcus Stoinis, Josh Inglis and Marco Jansen, while homegrown talents such as Prabhsimran Singh, Arshdeep Singh, Harpreet Brar, Shashank Singh and Nehal Wadhera played pivotal roles.Rising names like Xavier Bartlett, Priyansh Arya, Musheer Khan and Suryansh Shedge added depth and energy to the lineup. This combination of youth and experience was one of the biggest strengths of PBKS in 2025.The franchise’s historical performance in the IPL highlights its inconsistent yet occasionally brilliant journey. As Kings XI Punjab, the team enjoyed strong seasons in 2008 and 2014, finishing as semi-finalists and runners-up respectively. However, they also endured several years at the bottom of the table. After rebranding to Punjab Kings in 2021, the team’s fortunes fluctuated but eventually surged in 2025 when they topped the league standings and finished as runners-up—signalling a resurgence under new leadership.The table of past seasons clearly reflects the team’s evolution: a mix of mid-table finishes, a few disappointing campaigns, and standout years where they looked like title contenders. The dramatic turnaround in 2025 stands out as their best finish since the famous 2014 season.Shreyas Iyer (c), Nehal Wadhera, Priyansh Arya, Prabhsimran Singh, Shashank Singh, Pyla Avinash, Harnoor Pannu, Musheer Khan, Vishnu Vinod, Marcus Stoinis, Azmatullah Omarzai, Suryansh Shedge, Mitchell Owen, Arshdeep Singh, Vijaykumar Vyshak, Yash Thakur, Xavier Bartlett, Lockie Ferguson, Yuzvendra Chahal, Harpreet BrarGlenn Maxwell, Josh Inglis, Aaron Hardie, Kuldeep Sen, Praveen DubeyRs 11.50 crore is left for Punjab to spend in the upcoming auction, and they have the second-lowest purse going into the auction after Mumbai Indians.","In ipl 2025, punjab kings finished at the top of the points table, showcasing remarkable consistency.

What are the reasons behind Blackhawk defenseman Shea Weber’s absence from the league?

Hockey Hall of Fame Induction Speech: Shea Weber

Also read:





Shea Weber is a renowned Canadian professional ice hockey defenseman widely regarded as one of the most dominant blueliners of his era. He was recently traded to Chicago by Utah with Aku Raty and Victor Soderstrom for a 5th-round pick in the 2026 NHL Draft, March 7, 2025. He is one of the best players in the NHL, who was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2024. However, the Blackhawks defenseman has been out of action in the league for quite a long time. But what are the chances of his return to the ice? Let’s find out here in this article.As we all know, Shea Weber has been away from the league for a long time. As per reports, the former Montreal Canadien captain was last seen in action against the Lightning on July 7, 2021, which ended up being Weber's last NHL game due to injuries.However, Weber did not officially retire after that season. He was traded to the Vegas Golden Knights and then again to the Arizona Coyotes. Weber was acquired by the Chicago Blackhawks with a $7.86 million salary cap on March 7, 2025.The main reason behind his long hiatus from the league is due to his chronic foot and ankle injuries, and he is on the long-term injured reserve list, effectively out of the ice for a long time, since 2021. The status of his return to the league is still unknown to the NHL insiders and the Blackhawks organization.Reports suggest Weber finished his career playing 1,038 games and recording 589 points (224 goals and 365 assists). Apart from the Hockey Hall of Fame, he also earned the Mark Messier Leadership Award in 2016 and was named to the NHL's first and second all-star teams twice each. He never won a Norris Trophy but was a finalist three times.Drafted 49th overall by the Nashville Predators in 2003, he became the cornerstone of their defence for over a decade and served as team captain before being traded to the Montreal Canadiens. Known for his physical style of play, leadership, and a famously powerful slapshot, Weber earned multiple NHL All-Star selections and won hardest-shot competitions.In addition to this, he has also played a key role for Team Canada, capturing Olympic gold medals in both 2010 and 2014. Though injuries eventually sidelined him and his playing career wound down, his impact on the sport will be remembered forever by his fans, even if he decides to retire from the NHL.","Shea weber is a renowned canadian professional ice hockey defenseman who has been away from the nhl since 2021.

Rangers Coach and NHL Reporter clash: John Tortorella and Larry Brooks’ legendary exchanges

Tired of too many ads? go ad free now

John Tortorella and Larry Brooks spent years on opposite sides of some of hockey’s most unforgettable coach-reporter clashes. Their exchanges often exploded into headline-worthy moments, shaping a unique chapter in the New York Rangers’ media landscape. But when news surfaced of Brooks’ passing, Tortorella set aside the fiery past and chose to remember the man who stood across from him with unwavering conviction.For Tortorella, Brooks wasn’t just the journalist who challenged him; he was a constant presence, someone who asked tough questions without hesitation and always showed up the next day, no matter how intense the previous encounter had been. That consistency, John Tortorella admitted, was what earned Larry Brooks his lasting respect.During Tortorella’s tenure as the New York Rangers’ head coach, his back-and-forth with Brooks became some of the most replayed moments in NHL media. Their tension began even before Tortorella took the Rangers job. In 2007, while still coaching the Tampa Bay Lightning, he clashed with Brooks during a media scrum after a round of pointed questions. It set the tone for years of memorable confrontations.From the 2010 moment when Tortorella refused a question from Brooks, to the infamous quip about Brooks being “beat up at the bus stop,” their exchanges were fiery, unfiltered, and often tense. In 2011, the friction returned during the Stanley Cup Playoffs, with both men accusing the other of twisting words or stirring unnecessary conflict. Yet, through every argument, neither backed down.Tortorella made it clear in his tribute that despite the confrontations, he never felt disrespected by Brooks. What he remembered most was the journalist’s persistence, professionalism, and willingness to show up day after day, regardless of how heated things had been. “We disagree, and we go at it,” Tortorella said. “But he’d be right back the next day.”Larry Brooks leaves behind a legacy as one of the most impactful voices in Rangers and NHL reporting. And through Tortorella’s words, it reminded that some of the toughest rivalries in sports come from mutual dedication, not animosity, but a shared commitment to the truth of the game.","John tortorella and larry brooks were on opposite sides of some of hockey’s most unforgettable coach-reporter clashes.

Upper-body setback sidelines Seth Jarvis for Carolina Hurricanes



More coverage on NHL:





The Carolina Hurricanes experienced a concerning moment on Friday night when forward Seth Jarvis was forced to leave the game due to an upper-body setback. During a play behind the net, Jarvis was struck near the eye by teammate Andrei Svechnikov’s high stick. He did not return for the remainder of the first period, with the team listing the incident as an upper-body issue. The play was sudden and highlighted the physical intensity of NHL games, even in routine situations.Jarvis has been a key contributor for Carolina this season, entering the night with 10 goals and five assists through 16 games. At 23 years old, his offensive production has been integral to the Hurricanes’ early-season performance, and his temporary absence may affect line rotations and scoring depth. Known for his speed, vision, and scoring ability, Jarvis has emerged as one of Carolina’s most promising young forwards.Injuries involving the upper body, particularly near the eye, are taken seriously due to their potential impact on a player’s vision, mobility, and overall performance. Carolina’s coaching and medical staff are monitoring his condition closely, focusing on a cautious approach to ensure full recovery.Even a short absence can influence team dynamics, and the Hurricanes are likely to make tactical adjustments to maintain offensive balance while he recovers.The incident underscores the physical risks inherent in professional hockey, where even routine plays can have unexpected consequences. Carolina’s depth chart may need adjustments while Jarvis is unavailable, with other forwards stepping into increased responsibilities. His experience and familiarity with the team’s systems will be missed, but the organization is prepared to adapt while evaluating the full extent of his setback. Updates on Jarvis’ status are expected in the coming days as the Hurricanes’ medical team continues its assessment.Additionally, this injury could influence upcoming matchups as the Hurricanes manage their roster and line combinations. Coaching staff may adjust strategies, modify power-play and penalty-kill units, and shift responsibilities among forwards to compensate for Jarvis’ absence. Maintaining offensive consistency without Jarvis will be a priority, while ensuring he receives proper care to return at full strength.","Seth jarvis was struck near the eye by teammate andrei svechnikov’s high stick.

Why the Boston Red Sox Are Interested in Greene

Why the Reds Would Consider Trading Their Ace

Who Benefits Most?





The 2025 MLB offseason has already sparked its share of high-profile rumors, and one of the most talked-about possibilities centers on a potential blockbuster between the Boston Red Sox and the Cincinnati Reds. Several league insiders indicate that Boston is actively exploring moves to strengthen its rotation, and Cincinnati’s electric young ace Hunter Greene has quickly become one of the most discussed names on their radar.As speculation intensifies, the Boston Red Sox are believed to be constructing a competitive package that appeals to the Reds’ long-term offensive needs. Outfielder Wilyer Abreu, coming off a strong 2025 campaign, sits at the core of these discussions, with multiple prospects also viewed as realistic components of a multilateral deal.The rumored framework would send Greene and veteran catcher Jose Trevino to Boston. Cincinnati, in turn, would acquire Abreu along with promising young talents Franklin Arias and Jhostnyxon Garcia.• Red Sox Receive: Hunter Greene (RHP), Jose Trevino (C)• Reds Receive: Wilyer Abreu (OF), Franklin Arias (Prospect), Jhostnyxon Garcia (Prospect)This setup aligns with a familiar MLB pattern: a contending team adds a high-end pitcher with years of control, while a retooling team brings in a controllable offensive piece and valuable farm-system depth.Greene, 26, is coming off an elite showing in 2025, posting a 2.76 ERA, 0.94 WHIP, and a dominant 31.4% strikeout rate while averaging 99.4 mph on his fastball. Though he missed over two months with injuries, his ceiling remains one of the highest among young pitchers. His contract - six years at $53 million with team options - adds to his value, giving Boston an affordable potential ace to anchor its rotation. Trevino’s defensive abilities and leadership further strengthen the Boston Red Sox catching core.Cincinnati’s interest in Abreu is tied to their need for offensive upgrades. The team ranked 24th in Weighted Runs Created Plus and 21st in home runs in 2025, making an impact bat a priority. Abreu, age 26, hit .246 with an .810 OPS and 22 home runs last season. His defense grades in the 90th percentile, though he led MLB with five errors. Arias and Garcia add long-term upside and organizational depth, giving the Reds a more balanced roster outlook.Also read: MLB trade rumors: New York Yankees could sign $102 million New York Mets megastar to bolster squad and improve title odds The Boston Red Sox gains immediately with a frontline pitcher, assuming Greene stays healthy and performs at a Cy Young-level trajectory. Cincinnati, meanwhile, strengthens its lineup and replenishes its prospect pool, potentially laying groundwork for sustained improvement.

Camille Kostek illuminates her Instagram with a joyful tribute to her longtime love, Rob Gronkowski

More coverage on NFL WAGs:





The electric connection between Tom Brady and Rob Gronkowski echoes the dynamic spark we see today with Patrick Mahomes and Travis Kelce, offering a vivid lens for comparison. Brady, a seven-time Super Bowl legend, closed out his storied career with three seasons in Tampa Bay, hanging up his cleats as a Buccaneer in 2023. Gronkowski, never far from the spotlight, first retired from the New England Patriots in March 2019, only to be lured back by Brady for a Tampa Bay reunion. Their partnership delivered fourth Super Bowl win before Gronkowski announced his second retirement in June 2022. But was his heart truly at rest? Perhaps not, since he rewrote his retirement script. On November 12, Rob Gronkowski signed a ceremonial one-day contract with New England at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, so he could officially retire as a Patriot after 11 total NFL seasons. Witnessing this emotional homecoming, his longtime partner and SI Swimsuit star Camille Kostek celebrated on Instagram , sharing 11 photos, one supposedly for each season, and declaring him a “Patriot for life.”The first snapshot was taken inside Gillette Stadium, likely from the Patriots' office. The NFL couple stood in business casuals before a backdrop of Gronkowski’s moments as a Patriots player. Camille Kostek wore a dark denim blue co-ord set with a denim shirt and matching wide-legged trousers. Her medium-length wavy blond hair was left down. She wore glossy peach lipstick, blush, and prominent kohl on the corners of her eyes, along with big, round gold earrings.Gronkowski wore a navy-blue suit with a white collared shirt and brown and white shoes. He had a thin goatee and a spiked army cut.The next snapshot showed them with Patriots owner Robert Kraft, who appeared to be signing his one-day contract. Another image showed the Gillette Stadium Jumbotron displaying a big message: “THANK YOU GRONK,” with Patriots’ Super Bowl championship banners above, commemorating six victories. Other images included the four-time Super Bowl champion in an interview or photoshoot, the stadium in its raw form, and Gronkowski chatting with current head coach Mike Vrabel. The coach and the tight end never played together, as Gronkowski was drafted a year before Vrabel was traded. Vrabel played linebacker for the Patriots from 2001 to 2008. The last image is the cutest, featuring the couple’s French bulldog, Ralphie Gronkowski, whom Rob and Camille adopted in February 2021. Ralphie lies comfortably on a sofa, wearing a Patriots jersey.BBC Sport's Sean Kearns reported that Rob Gronkowski fulfilled the dying wish of his friend and charity partner, Susan Hurley, who was also a former Patriots cheerleader and founded CharityTeams in 2008, by signing a one-day contract with the New England Patriots. Hurley died from cancer earlier this month, and before she passed way, she publicly requested Gronkowski to return to the Patriots.","Gronkowski retired from the new england patriots in march 2019, only to be lured back by tom brady for a tampa bay reunion.

Valtteri Bottas supports Oscar Piastri and says F1 can be “not a fair sport”





Oscar Piastri is watching his 2025 Formula 1 title hopes fade as his lead over teammate Lando Norris has fully disappeared. Earlier in the season, Oscar Piastri was ahead by 34 points. But now, in November, he is 24 points behind after a tough run of races. This swing happened after the summer break, and it has placed the young Australian under heavy pressure during an important part of the season.Lando Norris has been very strong since the break. Among his four consecutive podium finishes are major victories in Brazil and Mexico. His Mexico victory came with a substantial 30-second lead; his victory in Brazil came with a clear 10-second lead. On the other hand, Oscar Piastri hasn't stepped onto the podium since Monza, six races ago. Including Valtteri Bottas's comments, this disparity has sparked several paddock talks.Valtteri Bottas spoke about Oscar Piastri’s situation this week and showed strong support. He told 7News Adelaide that he knew the feeling well from his time racing with Lewis Hamilton at Mercedes between 2017 and 2021.Valtteri Bottas said, “I’ve been there. Been there, mate. It’s a tough sport.It’s not a fair sport. Sometimes you just deal with it. Oscar has so much time ahead of him. He has a great career ahead. Sometimes you need patience.”Valtteri Bottas also talked to CODE Sports, saying he still hopes Oscar Piastri can win the 2025 title. He said, “I am rooting for him for the title. He still has a chance.”Including the Qatar Grand Prix, which has a Sprint Race with eight bonus points, Oscar Piastri has three race weekends remaining to narrow the 24-point margin. Just 25 points behind Oscar Piastri, Max Verstappen is also battling for second in the championship.Former Haas head Guenther Steiner also offered Oscar Piastri some harsh words. He suggested Oscar Piastri quit McLaren if he is unable to return better following this year.Guenther Steiner said Oscar Piastri faced “mysterious problems” during the American races and had to change parts of his driving style.Also Read: Olympic Legend Surya Bonaly Loses All Her Medals To Las Vegas Thieves While Caring For Her Cancer-Stricken Mother Steiner said Oscar Piastri must reset over the winter or think about switching teams.The next race is the Las Vegas Grand Prix, where McLaren struggled in 2024.

New Orleans Pelicans front office ends Willie Green’s tenure hours after reviewing the team’s direction





The New Orleans Pelicans made a clear and firm decision when they fired Willie Green only hours after a 118-104 home loss to the Los Angeles Lakers on November 14. The move came after a start that did not meet the standards of a team coming off a 49-33 season. New Orleans opened 0-6 and became the first team in NBA history to lose three of its first six games by at least 30 points. The team also allowed 120 points or more in each of its first five games, marking the worst defensive opening in franchise history.These results left little room for interpretation. The performance level was not close to what the roster was built for, and the front office responded. Willie Green addressed the pressure earlier in the season and spoke about staying focused on the players, but the issues remained the same across multiple games. If you look at how the season went, the firing was based strictly on the on-court product and the urgent need to change direction. The Pelicans acted decisively because the stats from the early weeks supported a major adjustment.Pelicans Executive Vice President of Basketball Operations Joe Dumars delivered the news in a statement released by the team on Saturday morning. ""After careful evaluation, we have made the difficult decision to make a change at head coach,"" Dumars said in the official announcement.He added, ""I have the utmost respect for Willie Green, and I’m sincerely appreciative of his contributions to the Pelicans organization and the New Orleans community. We wish him and his family all the best in the future.""Team owner Gayle Benson backed the move in a separate statement issued the same day. ""I have tremendous admiration and respect for Willie Green, and I truly appreciate all he has done for our organization over the last few years,"" Benson said. ""This is a tough business and these are difficult decisions.""In a recent interview prior to the firing, Benson had expressed urgency about the team's direction, ""We need to improve immediately. Our roster is built for success right now."" She also reiterated her confidence in Dumars, stating, ""I really like Willie Green, but I hired Joe Dumars to assess our basketball operation. And that’s what he is doing.""Dumars had previously defended retaining Green after a disappointing 21-61 finish in the 2024-25 season, the second-worst record in franchise history for an 82-game campaign. Speaking to media in May 2025, Dumars said, ""I'm looking forward to going forward and working with Willie and to push us to success. You've got to set the bar. And that's what we're going to do."" He focused on the desired style of play, adding, ""The style of play — resilience, toughness, playing hard, never quit — that’s what we want people to see right away. ""The New Orleans Pelicans were done hoping the same approach would fix itself. Willie Green had four-plus seasons and two playoff runs, but the early problems kept repeating. Add injuries to Zion Williamson and Dejounte Murray, and the team looked stuck again. Putting James Borrego in charge is their attempt to wake the roster up before the season gets even harder to recover from.Also Read: Stephen Curry seen rocking Nike just a day after ending his Under Armour partnership in a match against San Antonio Spurs",New orleans pelicans front office ends willie green's tenure hours after reviewing the team’s direction.
